And while much like Tobias Funke’s interpretation of it, it is more of a fire in Chicago than an actual fire sale, it’s a good step for the Bears. When teams are bad, they should get rid of everyone that won’t help them in the future. The Brewers started it this year (and I think will finish it this offseason), the Bucks did it and now the Bears are finally doing it. Are two sixth round picks really going to change the future for the team? Absolutely not. However, it frees up roster spots for players who could fit into the scheme. And more importantly, it makes them worse and gets them a better draft pick. Have we talked about Jared Goff yet? No? We will. Don’t worry. As far as my picks go, I am literally destroying Josh Flickinger right now. Three points ahead after three weeks? If that trend holds, I’ll beat him by like 40 points or something like that. I’m not great at math. Regardless, here is another week of flawless picks. If you’ve got money, put it on these teams. No doubters! • BALTIMORE AT PITTSBURGH: While the loss of Big Ben will send people running to the Ravens in this one, I still have some faith in the Steelers. While Vick is not a great quarterback, he isn’t Jimmy Clausen. He knows to get the ball to Antonio Brown, and Le’Veon Bell will run plenty on Thursday. The Ravens are struggling to find their identity (under Marc Trestman? Shocking!) and it won’t get any better on a short week. STEELERS 28, RAVENS 20. • NEW YORK JETS AT MIAMI: Joe Philbin is probably one more crapfest from being canned. I am honestly a little shocked he is still coaching. I kind of thought he was fired a year ago, but I guess he has something on the Dolphins’ ownership. The Jets aren’t going to help the Dolphins get things back on track, especially not with that defense. JETS 24, DOLPHINS 17. • HOUSTON AT ATLANTA: This is how I envision Matt Ryan’s reaction after he threw to Julio Jones 20 times Sunday. “Wait, so if I just keep throwing it over there, he’ll catch it a bunch? Well, this is awesome!” The Falcons are finally reaching their potential and while the Texans have some talent, it won’t be enough Sunday. FALCONS 31, TEXANS 21. • NEW YORK GIANTS AT BUFFALO: I struggled with this one as I think the Giants have a real shot at winning, but when it’s this close, I tend to go with the home team. Tyrod Taylor is coming around as a quarterback and I think the Bills’ defense is top three in the league. Go Bills. BILLS 23, GIANTS 20. • OAKLAND AT CHICAGO: Jimmy Clausen or David Fales or Henry Burris or Shane Matthews -- it really doesn’t matter. The Bears will be lucky to win three games this year and this is one of them, but without a healthy Cutler, they don’t stand a chance. Are we on the clock yet? RAIDERS 20, BEARS 17. • KANSAS CITY AT CINCINNATI: The Bengals are pretty good and it turns out that the Chiefs secondary is porous. AJ Green will have a big day and until the Chiefs learn to run the ball effectively again, it won’t be a great season for the Chefs. BENGALS 31, CHIEFS 21. • JACKSONVILLE AT INDIANAPOLIS: Andrew Luck battling a shoulder injury at least provides a reason as to why he kind of stinks this year. Me drafting him in fantasy would be the other reason he stinks, but that is for another time. I think the Colts start to get their mojo back a little thanks to the Jaguars being smelly. COLTS 28, JAGUARS 17. • CAROLINA AT TAMPA BAY: So maybe Cam Newton doesn’t need good receivers to be good? He played great last week and it’s not like the Bucs are going to provide much defensively to stop him. The Panthers are going to run away with the South division and it continues Sunday. PANTHERS 31, BUCS 13. • PHILADELPHIA AT WASHINGTON: Are the Eagles good? Is Washington? Is Taco Bell? I know the answer to one of those questions is, “Undoubtedly yes,” but the other two, I’m not so sure. I still believe the Eagles are the better team and I just can’t trust Washington. Maybe what the Eagles needed as Ryan Mathews to start playing instead of DeMarco Murray. Whatever the reason, lets hope they keep it up. EAGLES 30, WASHINGTON 20. • CLEVELAND AT SAN DIEGO: There is water on Mars now. Let’s play this game there, because honestly nobody on Earth cares. • MINNESOTA AT DENVER: I can’t trust Teddy Bridgewater in a hostile environment yet, so I’ll count on Peyton finding a way to pull this one out. I would say that Peyton hasn’t looked great thus far, but it is early and the Broncos still are looking to get their running game going. Let’s hope they get it going soon, because I don’t want to see the Patriots in the Super Bowl again. BRONCOS 27, VIKINGS 20. • ST. LOUIS AT ARIZONA: I am now convinced that the Cardinals and the Seahawks are the only two teams that can stop the Packers in the NFC this year. The Cardinals haven’t played a good team yet, but they’ve kicked the crap out of every team they’ve played and the Nic Foles-led Rams aren’t going to do much to challenge them. CARDINALS 31, RAMS 20. • GREEN BAY AT SAN FRANCISCO: The 49ers are so bad. This game will be over in the first quarter. PACKERS 42, 49ERS 17. • DALLAS AT NEW ORLEANS: If Drew Brees plays, this game is very different. I am writing this assuming he won’t play, which means the Cowboys have the advantage because...umm...I have no idea. But I feel it. Deep in my stomach. Wait, that’s chicken parm pasta. COWBOYS 24, SAINTS 23. • DETROIT AT SEATTLE: Well, Matt Stafford never makes bad choices and won’t on the road in Seattle, right? RIGHT? This will be a disaster for the Lions, especially if they keep trying to give Joique Bell the ball.
