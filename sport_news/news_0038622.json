Linebacker Jeremiah Gemmel (33) and lineman Dontavious Burks each led the Indians with eight tackles. \nThere's no doubt that East Coweta's thrilling 7-0 football victory over Westlake last Friday at Garland Shoemake Stadium had a championship- like feel to it. \nYet the Region 3- playoff race is far from over. \nA week after defeating one of four remaining unbeaten teams in 3- , the Indians (5- 0, 2- 0) face another in Langston Hughes (2-3, 2-0). And even if East Coweta continues its unbeaten pace this week, there could be a third challenger to overÂ­come on Oct. 30 at Drake Stadium en route to a possible region title. \nWhich is why as impressive as Act I has been for the Indians midway through regular season, there expects to be some drama through the final five games as the playoff race tightens further. \nThis week East Coweta takes on not only a Panthers team that is more talented than its overall record, but takes on an internal challenge to stay focused following its biggest win of the season so far. \nLast year at this time, the Indians were on the other side of that situation after suffering their first loss of the year to Westlake. \nIn handing defending region champion Westlake its first divisional loss since 2013, the Indians capitalized to score off a fumbled punt return and then held the Lions on downs inside their own 15 yard-line in the closing minutes. \nEast Coweta held Westlake to 147 yards, with just 46 of it coming on the ground. An offensive struggle for both teams saw the Indians offense equally stymied for less than 100 total yards in the victory. \n'Both teams played great defense,' said East Coweta head coach Steve Pardue. 'I thought we had a good week of practice. I think a lot of it had to do with our preparation and our coaches did a great job executing our game plan.' \nOne this week while preparing for Langston Hughes will equally center on slowing down a young Panthers lineup that quickly became battle-tested through a formidable non-region schedule that included losses to Class No. 2 ranked Grayson, Class No. 5 ranked Mays and Creekside. \n'I don't look at records, I look at film,' Pardue said of Hughes. 'If you look at their first three games and take any team in the state and give them that schedule, I don't know too many schools that aren't going to go 0-3. [Head coach] Willie Cannon's done a great job with that program. They're a little younger than they've been in the past, but they're well coached and they don't beat themselves.' \nAfter struggling in its infancy as a program, Hughes has posted the region's best record over the past four years with 31 victories and three consecutive state-playoff seasons that included region titles in both 2012 and 2013. \nThe nucleus of those lineups, however, graduated during the offseason including seven All-Region First Team players and Defensive Player of the Year D'Andre Walker, now a freshman at Georgia. \nBut between a group of returners and a few new faces - highlighted by 6-0, 205pound freshman linebacker Charles Thomas - Hughes' defense remains potent. \nThomas joins linebacker turned defensive end Joshua Swilling (6-2, 228) of the same Georgia Tech bloodlines, senior linebacker Jeffrey Allison (6-1, 235) and senior safety Jamarcus Whitmore (6-0, 185) among a talented lineup looking to keep East Coweta's offense in check for the second straight week. \nSwilling has been tagged to step into Walker's former role as a rusher from the edge, posting 34 tackles and a teamhigh two sacks through five games. \nAllison leads the team with 51 tackles and Whitmore has one of the team's three interceptions. \n'They still have some very good players,' Pardue said. 'They're not a blitzing team. They still rely on their front four to cause problems.' \nEast Coweta's defense did the same last week against Westlake, finishing with seven tackles for loss, two sacks and two forced fumbles in the win. Senior lineman Dontavious Burks and linebacker Jeremiah Gemmel each led the Indians with eight tackles, while Burks added a sack and two tackles for loss. \nFellow linebacker Alex Jimerson continued his stellar senior year with six tackles and his first sack of the 2015 season. Senior defensive lineman Lejoi Allen came up with four tackles and a forced fumble while moving back into the lineup the past two weeks. \nEast Coweta's secondary, meanwhile, could get its biggest test of the season so far. Second-year starting quarterback Isaiah Green has connected on 62-percent of his throws this year, going 83 of 133 passing for 1,210 yards and eight touchdowns. \nFour Panthers enter this week with at least nine receptions, led by juniors Sean Nelson (17 rec., 329 yds) and Deshawn Ross (17 rec., 192 yds). \n'[Green] came on against us last year and kinda came into his own,' Pardue said of a 28-10 loss to Hughes at Garland Shoemake Stadium that saw Green throw for three touchdowns. \nThe Indians fell behind 14-10 at halftime in last year's game, finishing with three turnovers. \nJunior second-year starting quarterback Will LaGuardia was intercepted twice by Westlake while having an upand- down start to region play that began with an outstanding 18-for-22, three touchdown effort to beat Campbell. \nEast Coweta running back Devonte Brown (528 yds, 7 TDs) and fullback Carlos Ford (360 yds, TD) are both averaging over 8-yards among 99 combined carries this season. \nIf there could be a difference maker this week, it may again come from special teams. The Indians have feasted on opponents' mistakes, blocking six kicks over five games in addition to last week's crucial fumble recovery that led to the gamewinning touchdown against Westlake. \nFirst-year kicker Wyatt Palmer remains a perfect 19-for-19 on extra points and is 1-for-2 this year on fieldgoal attempts. \nLangston Hughes kicker Fernando Sdelamore is 16-for-17 on PATs and the Panthers have averaged just over 28 yards on five punt returns this year, all by senior Rashad Burch. \n'Our special teams hvae come up with some big plays for us so far,' Pardue said.
