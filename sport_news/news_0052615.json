Its lede: “Ole Miss bounced back from a disappointing loss at Memphis . . .”\nESPN called the Rebels’ loss to Memphis “devastating” and added “this (Ole Miss) team absolutely needed this win (Saturday over Texas A&M) after the disaster at Memphis.”\nIn another season, in another non-Justin Fuente/non-DeAngelo Williams era, such descriptions would be understandable. But the 37-24 victory by the Tigers Oct. 17 at Liberty Bowl Memorial was not the fluke, say, the 21-17 win by Memphis over No. 6 Tennessee was in 1996. That was a 3-6 Memphis team that entered the game against the Vols averaging six points per game in its previous three outings, all losses.\nThis Memphis team is ranked 16th nationally after Friday’s lopsided American Athletic Conference win at Tulsa, its status earned through a school-record 14-game winning streak.\nIts quarterback, Paxton Lynch, has gone from a relatively unknown a year ago (outside of directing last year’s win over BYU in the Miami Beach Bowl) to a likely first-round NFL Draft choice and a candidate for the Heisman Trophy. Its coach, Justin Fuente, has risen from a relative unknown TCU assistant in 2011 to one of college football’s coveted prospects, his name appearing on lists of candidates for multiple openings at Power Five conference programs.\nNo Memphis football coach has attracted legitimate attention from major programs in more than 40 years.\nEntering this week’s home game against Tulane, Memphis ranks third nationally in scoring (at 48.9 points per game), third in passing efficiency (19 TDs and 1 pick in 254 pass attempts) and No. 6 in total offense (557 yards per game). The Tigers rank first nationally in red zone offense, converting 97.6 percent of the time inside the 20).\nFor perspective, perhaps Sports Illustrated had the better choice of words:\n“At the end of the season, we may look back on Ole Miss’s loss at Memphis and conclude that the Rebels simply were beaten on the road by a really good team with a rising star of a coach (Justin Fuente) and a future NFL quarterback in Paxton Lynch. The Tigers, after all, are undefeated and in contention to earn a berth in a New Year’s Six bowl game.”\nSPEAKING OF OLE MISS: Nothing may have been more impressive in the SEC last weekend (outside of Arkansas’s dramatics in a quadruple overtime victory against Auburn) than the Rebels’ dominance in their 23-3 win over Texas A&M.\nTwo weeks ago the Aggies were the SEC’s No. 2 scoring offense at 39 points per game and the league’s No. 2 ranked offense at 480 yards per game. Ole Miss, minus All-America defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche (concussion) and several other key defensive starters, limited the Aggies to 192 yards and 11 first downs.\nThe Rebels’ defensive pressure forced three turnovers and held A&M quarterback Kyle Allen to 0-for-12 passing in the third quarter.\nOffensively, ex-Ridgeway star Jaylen Walton rushed for 97 yards to lead the Rebels, who remain in contention for the SEC West title with one league loss and a key win over Alabama. Ole Miss’s Nov. 21 home game against unbeaten LSU may decide the division. If the Rebels run the table (at Auburn, vs. Arkansas, vs. LSU, at Mississippi State), they’ll win the West.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0zmD9-CgIY", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaGUZwvRHLE", "http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/25352562/ole-miss-rebounds-from-memphis-loss-dominates-texas-am-23-3"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:20:30.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
