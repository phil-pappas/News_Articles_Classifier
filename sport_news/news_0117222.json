The Rangers won, 4-0. Credit Frank Franklin Ii/Associated Press \nAdvertisement Antti Raanta made 22 saves in his Rangers debut to lead them to a 4-0 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Monday night at Madison Square Garden. It was his fourth career shutout. Marc Staal, Mats Zuccarello, Jesper Fast and Viktor Stalberg scored for the Rangers, who ended a three-game winless streak (0-2-1) after opening the season with three victories. Raanta was playing for the first time since being acquired from Chicago in a draft-day trade in June. Martin Jones finished with 24 saves in his first loss of the season as the Sharks lost their second straight after opening the season with four wins. Jones had allowed just two goals in the Sharks’ season-opening winning streak and came in leading the N.H.L. in goals-against average (0.49), save percentage (.982) and shutouts (two). Alain Vigneault opted to keep the same forward lines and defense pairings that scored only once in the Rangers’ 2-1 overtime loss to the Devils on Sunday.

The Rangers continued to attack in what was the team’s most complete performance of the season. While Raanta did not have to work especially hard, his toughest stop occurred early in the second period as the Rangers were killing a five-on-three Sharks power play. San Jose center Joe Thornton tried a quick shot from along the goal line as Patrick Marleau drove the net, but Raanta kicked the puck away. The save was significant when Zuccarello scored his fourth of the season later in the period. With Rick Nash screening Jones, Zuccarello whipped a shot from the right side into the net. Fast had a breakaway goal 3:47 into the third period. Raanta made a left pad save on Thomas Hertl as the Sharks came in on a two-on-one. Stalberg’s goal with 3:16 left ended the scoring. COYOTES’ VITALE SIDELINED Arizona placed center Joe Vitale on injured reserve with an upper-body injury and recalled forward Matthias Plachta from Springfield of the American Hockey League. Vitale was injured in Saturday’s game against Boston after a fight with the Bruins’ Kevan Miller. He went to the hospital for X-rays after the game. Plachta, a 24-year-old from Germany, appeared in three games with Springfield this season after starting his career in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. KINGS’ PRACTICE WOES Los Angeles’s practice schedule is tentative these days while power shutdowns plague the neighborhood around their training complex. The Kings were forced to cancel the on-ice portion of practice Monday for the second time this month because the ice at the Toyota Sports Center was not playable. The area just southeast of Los Angeles International Airport has endured multiple power shutdowns in October.
