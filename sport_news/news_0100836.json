The day’s times may have a bit slow due to a muddy course drenched by over an inch of rain Friday afternoon; cutting corners and charging hard throughout were difficult because of the soft, muddy surface that made it hard to gain traction. \nBut Sherman seemed unscathed. \n“I was really pleased with how I did today,” Sherman said. “I like this course and this was perfect weather. I have not really been feeling well all season, but today I felt it; I felt good.” \nEaston coach Bobbi Jo Powell was pleased with Sherman. \n“Greg attacked the race today,” she said. “He really competed well today.” \nSherman showed some impressive strength, running by himself much of the race, as he works towards the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference and District 11 meets. \n“I medaled in both of those races last year and that is my goal this year as well,” he said. \nPhillipsburg also has a big meet coming up as it hosts the Hunterdon/Warren/Sussex championships Thursday, and Hardin used Lapsansky’s presence to prepare for a big push in the H/W/S meet. \n“I wanted to take the hills out strong against Kevin and try and open a gap over him in the first mile because I know he has a really strong kick,” said the Stateliner senior of Easton’s No. 1 runner. “I think I ran well. Running neck-and-neck with Kevin prepares you to run in the big meets coming up. I tried to catch up with him at the end but he’s a really good 800-meter runner and hard to stay with.” \nP’burg only had one other runner in the top 10 – junior Quincy Herdlein was ninth in 18:22 as the Rovers put their first seven runners home in a spread of just 1:22 -- and Hardin said it was a hard result for the Stateliners to handle. \n“This is a meet you mark on your calendar,” he said. “This is just as important as the (Skyland) Conference meet for us. We have to come out of here holding our heads up high; there will be other big meets for us. But it’s tough, being a ‘Liner, to lose to Easton.” \nGreg Sherman knows just how Jake Hardin and the Stateliners feel about the rivalry – but he doesn’t know what it is like to lose it in cross country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:21:54.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
