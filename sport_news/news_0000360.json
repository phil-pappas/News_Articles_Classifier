Earnest said he’s open to a bet between the two. \nCruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, in 1970, while his parents were working in the oil business there. Of course, Calgary and Toronto are nearly 1,700 miles apart. \nEarlier this week, the Democratic Party tweeted it was so excited about the presidential campaign debate that it almost forgot to wish Cruz a happy Canadian Thanksgiving.
