What began as a territorial battle between Wisconsin short track aces and Illinois hot shots evolved into one the premier post-season U.S. short track events. In 2015, the race Deery christened the “National Short Track Championships” turns half a century old. Sure there are several other post-season races held each fall in different corners of the country, all of them come with their share of prestige and history. Some of them come with a little more media hype than others. But few have operated as long as the NSTC at Rockford Speedway. And even fewer boast the rich history Rockford does. It started back in 1966, when a youngster from central Wisconsin lapped the field in his Ford. Fifty years later, many look back at that win by Dick Trickle of Wisconsin Rapids as one of the first major victories for one of America’s finest short track racers, who tallied nearly 1,200 wins in his illustrious career. Trickle was a three-time winner of the event (1966, 1978 & 1979) and one of the first names many fans associate with the NSTC. If fans don’t think of Trickle first, odds are they remember Joe Shear. A six-time Rockford Speedway Late Model champion, Shear was one of the all-time greats at the intimidating quarter mile. Shear won his first NSTC 200-lapper in 1972 and then conquered Rockford and the NSTC seven more times including a sweep of the ARTGO and “Rockford Rules” NSTC races in 1987 and his final victory in 1997. That 1997 event was one of the most emotional days in its history, as Shear topped Steve Carlson in the 300-lap marathon. The died the following March, losing his battle with cancer. Carlson joins Shear at the top of the all-time NSTC wins list with eight, including seven of nine between 1992 and 2000. Only Scott Hansen (1994) and Shear (1997) stopped Carlson during his dominant run at Rockford in the 90’s. The West Salem, Wis., resident notched his record-tying eighth NSTC win in October of 2011, winning the only ARCA Midwest Tour sanctioned NSTC 200 to date. Few drivers have excelled in distance racers at Rockford Speedway like Wheaton’s Eddie Hoffman. Along with being a two-time NSTC winner in the Mid American Stock Car Series, Hoffman trails only Shear and Carlson with four victories in the weekend’s premier race (2001, 2004, 2005, 2013), including a win in the longest NSTC ever run, the 405-lapper in 2001. One of the more well-known victors in NSTC history is Mark Martin. As a teenager, the Batesville, Ark., native and his teenage crew chief Banjo Grimm came to northern Illinois and won the 1977 NSTC. Martin still reflects on that win as one of the races that put him on the stock car racing map. Edgerton native Rich Bickle is a two-time National Short Track Champion, winning his two crowns 22 years apart. In 1990, Bickle outran Georgia’s Mike Garvey in a 300-lap event. Then, in the year 2012, it was Bickle racing to the lead and holding off a hard charge from Casey Johnson. The list of former winners goes on and on; Keokuk Iowa’s Ramo Stott captured the 4th Annual NSTC in 1969, and in the years after he captured two ARCA championships and won the 1976 Daytona 500 pole. Oakville, Ontario’s Junior Hanley, pocketed NSTC gold in 1981. Wisconsin legend Jim Sauter and Tennessee star Mike Alexander both captured NSTC wins in 1980 and 1986, respectively, u while Minnesota’s Mike Miller and Michigan’s Butch Miller became NSTC champions in 1973 and 1991, urespectively. As impressive as the list of NSTC winners is, the list of drivers who have tried to conquer the “high banks” is just as impressive. Names like Matt Kenseth, Rusty Wallace, Johnny Sauter, Alan Kulwicki, Greg Biffle, Landon Cassill, Jamie McMurray, Paul Menard, Rick Crawford, Jason Keller, Garrett Evans, David Green, Tony Raines, Bryan Reffner, Scott Wimmer and Bill Venturini have all tried to pocket a victory in Rockford’s NSTC, but came up empty. How will the 50th Anniversary NSTC play out? Will a veteran multi-time winner like Hoffman or Bickle re-enter victory lane? Can 2014 winner Steve Rubeck capture a third NSTC crown and put himself in elite company? Will a new name be added to the list of legends? After 200 laps on a Sunday afternoon in northern Illinois we’ll know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:01:05.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
