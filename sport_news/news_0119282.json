Young, Detroit News) \nAnn Arbor — With 10 seconds left, Michigan State miraculously pulled off a stunning win over Michigan to keep its in-state series domination intact.\nMichigan punter Blake O’Neill took a low snap, dropped it, picked it up and spun around as though he was going to kick it, but fumbled. Michigan State’s Jalen Watts-Jackson scored on a 38-yard return giving the Spartans a 27-23 victory on Saturday at Michigan Stadium.\nIt was the lone turnover of the game.\nThe Spartans have won seven of the last eight against Michigan and three straight. Michigan State, ranked No. 7, remains unbeaten at 7-0, 3-0 Big Ten. Michigan, which entered the game ranked No. 12, is 5-2, 2-1 Big Ten.\nWith ESPN’s GameDay here for the matchup the game was hyped all week, in part because it was the first game of the series for Jim Harbaugh as Michigan coach. He was a player in the series when he quarterbacked the Wolverines.\nThe game lived up to the hype.\nWith 1:47 left in the game and Michigan State playing from behind, the Spartans faced fourth down and 19 at the Michigan 45-yard line. A three-man rush forced Michigan State’s outstanding quarterback Connor Cook to throw incomplete into double coverage, preserving the Wolverines’ slim lead. The throw was intended for Macgarrett Kings Jr. and Dymonte Thomas made the game-saving pass breakup.\nThat gave the Wolverines the ball for one last drive.\nMichigan State finished with 386 yards, including 58 rushing, and Michigan had 230 yards and 62 rushing.\nKenny Allen made his third field goal of the game, a 38-yarder, to swell Michigan’s lead to 23-14 with 9:25 left in the game. Michigan had the ball on the MSU 28-yard line after a punt return from Jabrill Peppers, but could not move beyond the 20.\nBut Michigan State immediately responded, burning the Michigan defense with a 75-yard pass from Connor Cook to fullback Trevon Pendleton, ruled down at the 1-yard line after a review. LJ Scott scored his second touchdown of the game, cutting into Michigan’s lead, 23-21 with 8:56 left in the game.\nThe Wolverines next drive ended when Jehu Chesson dropped a sure first-down pass from Jake Rudock, mirroring a Michigan State dropped pass earlier in the second half.\nThe Wolverines built a 17-7 lead in the third quarter, but it took three efforts and three reviews before fullback Sione Houma scored his second rushing touchdown of the game on a one-yard run. Michigan got a boost on the drive on a pass to Peppers for a 28-yard drive in his first significant play on offense.\nThis began a flurry of scoring.\nMichigan State responded with a 75-yard, five-play drive and quarterback Connor Cook completing a beautiful 30-yard throw to Kings, to pull the Spartans within 17-14.\nAnd then the Wolverines stretched the lead to 20-14 on the next series, using five minutes to drive 62 yards in 10 plays. Amara Darboh made the most of an underthrown pass from U-M quarterback Jake Rudock and converted the third down and nine with a 32-yard reception. Allen made a 21-yard field goal.\nLate in the third quarter, penalties, an issue all day for the Wolverines, although the game’s officiating was questionable throughout, gave MSU renewed life. After the Michigan defense pushed back Delton Williams back for a one-yard loss on third and 2, Michigan’s Willie Henry jumped on the pile late and was called for a unnecessary roughness.\nMichigan State got the first down at the Michigan 32-yard line to open the fourth quarter. But the drive ended on downs after Kings dropped a perfect pass from Cook.\nMichigan took a 10-7 lead into halftime after a first half with a questionable targeting call and some outstanding special teams play by the Wolverines.\nBoth teams were scoreless in the first quarter. Michigan State had a 16-play, 80-yard drive that consumed 8:05 of the clock, but came up empty-handed. Cook threw incomplete on third-and-8 and then after a high snap, he threw incomplete on fourth down.\nMichigan got the ball with 1:59 left and began its 72-yard march that would result in the game’s first points early in the second quarter. The Wolverines got an important third-down on a 21-yard-pass from Rudock to A.J. Williams to reach the MSU 23-yard line before the second quarter.\nRudock showed some composure and patience rolling right and hitting Chesson on an 11-yard gain to the 8-yard line two plays later, and Houma scored on a two-yard touchdown for the 7-0 lead.\nThe Wolverines forced a three-and-out and came up empty handed on their next possession. But on the Spartans’ next drive, Cook kept the ball for a six-yard run, and Michigan linebacker Joe Bolden was called for targeting and ejected from the game.\nWith the ball at the Michigan 11-yard line, Scott ran for the score, tying the game.\nSpecial teams played a role next on the ensuing kickoff as Peppers returned it 49 yards to the MSU 48-yard line. Five plays later, Michigan built a 10-7 lead after Allen’s 38-yard field goal.\nMichigan finished the half with 95 yards, including 42 rushing. Michigan State came into the game with several players ailing, but the offensive line got a boost as junior left tackle Jack Conklin (knee) started. He has missed the last two games after leaving the Central Michigan game early. Fifth-year senior center Jack Allen, however, was on the dress list after injuring his ankle a week earlier at Rutgers, but his younger brother, Brian Allen, a sophomore, started.\nThe Spartans finished the first half with 142 yards, including 48 rushing.\nachengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:01:15.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
