He has to give the defense looks as both Andrew Luck and Matt Hasselbeck given it’s not fully clear which Colts quarterback will be starting on Sunday. Luck is the likely starter, but he's missed the past two games with a shoulder injury.\nGiven the uncertainty, Garoppolo has studied up on the mannerisms of both, and was ready to put it out on the field today.\n“The defensive coaches do a good job of telling what they want on each play, leaning towards one (quarterback) or the other,” Garoppolo said. “So it’s double duty this week.”\nGaroppolo said the common denominator was that he was essentially running the same offense, even if the two quarterbacks had different styles.\n“With both guys, it’s a similar offense,” Garoppolo said. “That doesn’t drastically change. Luck’s a little more athletic than Hasselbeck. They both throw the ball very well.”\nLuck is more methodical, and has the ability to get the ball downfield, while the 40-year-old Hasselbeck doesn’t mess around. He makes his read and gets rid of the ball quickly on the shorter routes.\n“Luck probably takes a couple more shots here and there,” Garoppolo said. “But for the most part, they’re pretty similar. Pep Hamilton, the offensive coordinator, does a good job getting them in plays they’re comfortable with. It’s my job to go out there and imitate them the best I can.”\nDoes Garoppolo enjoy playing the opposing quarterback, or in this case, quarterbacks?\n“Oh yeah, it’s always fun.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:56:20.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
