The Philadelphia Eagles will travel to the D.C. area for a showdown with the NFC East rival Washington Redskins on Sunday at FedEx Field and it was noticed by one seasoned scribe that the appearance of the team’s media guide for the game has an interesting difference from guides for other games this season.\nAdChoices Instead of the cover touting the Eagles vs. Falcons match-up or an Eagles vs. Jets showdown, the one for this week’s game features a Philadelphia vs. Washington title .\nThis is interesting. The #Eagles appear to have wiped the name #Redskins from this week's weekly media guide. #NFL pic.twitter.com/VgA9ksVrbi\n— Matt Lombardo (@MattLombardo975) September 30, 2015\nGiven NJ Advanced Media’s Matt Lombardo has been covering the Philadelphia sports scene for some time, it’s a safe assumption this must be a new development and not something the Eagles have done in the past for media guides in order to avoid the controversy surrounding the Washington NFL team’s name.\nPerhaps the Eagles have decided to join the numerous other media outlets throughout the country who have made it organizational policy to not use the Redskins name in its reporting. Or it could be some Grade-A trolling on behalf of the Eagles by rubbing their opponent’s nose in the never-ending controversy .\nWhatever the case, it’s safe to say that Jeb Bush doesn’t get it , regardless of the motivation behind it.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2015/01/23/new-ad-imagines-washington-team-without-redskins-name-logo/", "https://twitter.com/MattLombardo975/status/649259077579747328", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eagles?src=hash", "http://t.co/VgA9ksVrbi", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Redskins?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFL?src=hash", "http://www.crossingbroad.com/2015/09/the-eagles-apparently-removed-redskins-from-media-guide-this-week.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://time.com/4056055/jeb-bush-redskins/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:10:50.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
