If not for the Welcome to Panther Country water tower at the north end of this stretch, nothing would stand out. \nThe argument could be made that same stretch is the only thing separating the two best teams in District 2-2A. \nOuachita Christian will travel that stretch Thursday for the district play opener against the Panthers in a matchup that carries heavy district implications, continues a historic rivalry and rematches opponents from the preseason. \n“It’ll be a great atmosphere. We had a great crowd last year and we weren’t even in the district together,” Ouachita Christian coach Steven Fitzhugh said. “It’s always been a good, friendly rivalry. Being in the district adds more stakes to it.” \nSterlington coach Jason Thompson added, “OCS and Sterlington was a rivalry long before I got here and it’ll be a rivalry long after I’m gone. Our kids know theirs and their kids know ours, so it should be a pretty electric atmosphere.” \nSterlington enters the game with a perfect 5-0 record and the No. 1 ranking in 2A. Ouachita Christian is No. 7 in 2A after last week’s 35-28 loss to 5A Alexandria. Fitzhugh is not a moral victory type of coach, but did see a positive in the Alexandria game. \n“There were no moral victories there. We felt like we gave the game away,” Fitzhugh said. “We felt like the guys competed and did some things well, but the thing we preach is, in the tight ball games, the team that makes the fewest mistakes is going to win. Alexandria made fewer mistakes than we did. \n“We faced (adversity) in the ball game, got down two touchdowns, but our guys kept with it, stayed with the game plan and kept fighting back. That was a positive thing to see, I did like how we responded to adversity. Really, we did not see any adversity in the first four games, and I was proud of the way we responded to it.” \nAdversity is almost certain to come in a game between teams as evenly matched as the Eagles and the Panthers, as the jamboree proved. \n“The jamboree was a great preview. Goodness, that was a high-scoring one,” Fitzhugh said. “I hope the defense will tighten up a little bit from that one. \n“That was 35-28 just in a half. Both teams scored on every possession except they fumbled one possession. That was the difference in the game, that one turnover.” \nThat being said, both coaches quickly noticed improvements and additions to their opponent’s schemes since the jamboree. \n“They’re definitely doing a lot more things offensively than they were then,” Fitzhugh said of Sterlington. “They’re not just lining up in pro-I, they’re going empty, spread, motion and added a whole lot more you have to prepare for than a base I team.” \nThompson added of the Eagles, “They’re going to get their playmakers the ball, and that’s (running back Josh) Pennebaker and (quarterback Grant) Fitzhugh. But, what’s most impressive about them since the jamboree is their throwing game. They’re all a bunch of possession receivers out there that go out and get the football. Very impressed with the progress they’ve made out there.” \nFollow Brett on Twitter, @BHudsonTNS. 4 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1RtTk6E TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:41:46.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
