The travel show is an Oregonian Media Group event.\nFirst off, it helps to know where the Cook Islands are located. The inference is that they are named for British Capt. James Cook, which means they are in the Pacific Ocean, which Cook famously explored three times in the late 18th century. But where in that vast expanse?\nLet's just say if you fly from Los Angeles, a West Coast gateway to New Zealand, to Auckland, the biggest city in the island nation, you'll pass just about directly over the island of Rarotonga, largest in the Cooks.\nMay as well ask the captain to set down the Air New Zealand jet for a look around, right? One day a week, the airline does just that, adding a stop to and from the Cooks on that flight between New Zealand and California. The stopover comes at no extra charge by the airline, the Cook Islands let you enter with just a passport and those islands are fabulously beautiful.\nThe main islands are surrounded by their own atoll, which colors the near shore waters turquoise and keeps the sharks from nibbling on tourists' toes. It's classic South Pacific island beauty, located due south of Hawaii's Kauai Island, about as far south of the equator as Hawaii is north, and on the North American side of the International Date Line. Tahiti is to the east and Samoa to the west, while New Zealand is another four-plus hours of flying to the southwest.\nThe Cook Islands can be the idyllic stopover. They are said to be like Hawaii was in the 1930s, lightly populated, very friendly, English speaking, not too expensive and no hotels taller than a palm tree. Only about 7,500 North Americans visit each year. Peak Travel Group of Portland was at the travel show to assist your travel planning to the Cook Islands.\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": ["http://www.oregonianmediagroup.com/travel-show/", "http://www.airnewzealand.com/best-price-to-the-cook-islands"], "published": "2015-10-11T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:05:06.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
