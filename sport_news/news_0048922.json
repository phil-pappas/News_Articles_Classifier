Virtually every ... more > By BARRY WILNER   \nThe Washington Redskins once won a Super Bowl with a collection of wide receivers called “The Smurfs.” \nThat just won’t fly in the NFL anymore, although there are plenty of vertically challenged wideouts throughout the league. Standouts Steve Smith Sr., Odell Beckham Jr., Emmanuel Sanders and Julian Edelman all are under 6-foot tall, some of them well below that measure. \nRegardless of their skill and production, the “little guys” are outnumbered throughout the league by wideouts who, well, look down on them. And who peer down at defensive backs, few of which - outside of the Legion of Boom in Seattle and its defectors on other rosters such as Brandon Browner, now in New Orleans - pass the height test in comparison. \nVirtually every team relies on at least one receiver who is taller than 6-1, with some owning a collection of them. Vincent Jackson and Mike Evans in Tampa are both 6-5. Not to be outdone in Florida, Jacksonville has Allen Hurns and Allen Robinson, both 6-3. \nBrandon Marshall of the Jets goes 6-4 and sidekick Eric Decker is 6-3. Philadelphia’s Jordan Matthews, who usually plays in the slot, normally the territory of the shorter wideouts, is 6-3. \nFrom Pittsburgh’s Martavis Bryant (6-4) to Dallas’ Dez Bryant (6-2), tall targets are in vogue. \n“There are some big receivers in this league,” Dolphins 6-1 safety Reshad Jones notices. “Some of them are like tight ends. Big receivers, you’ve got to get your hands on them and don’t let them get going. Get them down on the ground.” \nNot so easy when they also outweigh the defensive backs, even the safeties - Jones goes 215 in comparison to Detroit’s Megatron, Calvin Johnson, at 236. And many can run just as quickly as the guys trying to shadow them. \nAll-Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis (5-11, 198) is dwarfed by his Jets teammate, Marshall. Revis, of course, makes up for such inequities when he faces the likes of Arizona’s Larry Fitzgerald (6-3, 218) or Cincinnati’s A.J. Green (6-4, 208) through experience and wisdom. At least most of the time, but not always. \n“He is so intelligent as a receiver, he’s very smart. He knows how to get open,” Revis says of Marshall. “He knows how to use his body, he knows how to use his strength and his size. If there could be another Megatron, it would be him. I would put those two, him and Calvin Johnson, in the same category of big, tall receivers, 6-5, 230-plus and can run like a skill player.” \nOne of the most skilled tall receivers in NFL history was Hall of Famer James Lofton. He went 6-3, 192 in an era when 200 pounds for a wideout was hefty. \nLofton had speed, craftiness, durability and diligence, all critical attributes for a wideout. And he had length. \n“One of the first things to look at is catch radius. How much,” says Lofton, who played 16 seasons, caught 764 passes, averaging 18.3 yards per reception, and had 75 touchdowns while making eight Pro Bowls. “Some big guys you would think would be can’t-miss guys but are average because they don’t use their length and size. \n“On some passes, bigger is better. As you’re going downfield, trying to throw a back shoulder or the fade or the lob, the 5-9 guy is at a distinct disadvantage. The 5-9 defensive back, he is under the receiver. \n“From a quarterback’s perspective if you are throwing the ball down the field, the guy who is 6-4 doesn’t have to be as open as the guy who is 5-10. That’s why Antonio Brown (5-10) and Sanders (5-11) are very unique in their ability to play bigger than their listed size. There are some guys who are tall who play smaller.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:36:34.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
