Baylor won 66-7. Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 3:00 am Struggling Mountaineers faced with another tough challenge By Cam Huffman Sports Editor Register Herald \nIf there’s a gold and blue panic button under one of the coaches’ desks inside the Puskar Center at West Virginia University’s Milan Puskar Stadium, it has to be feeling a lot of eyes looking in its direction if it hasn’t already been pushed. \nThe 2015 season, which started with so much promise and so many expectations, has progressed to the point where the Mountaineers are standing on the edge of the New River Gorge Bridge, hoping that a bungee cord no thicker than a shoelace will be enough to stop their plummet into the New River before the end of the month. \nAfter back-to-back losses to Oklahoma and Oklahoma State to open Big 12 play, West Virginia (3-2, 0-2 Big 12) is facing a pair of road trips — Baylor and TCU — that don’t appear to be the prescription to cure its ails. But this isn’t golf, and Holgorsen knows he won’t receive a mulligan. The only option is to keep working and come up with a game plan for No. 2 Baylor (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) on Saturday in Waco, Texas. \n“We have to get back to work, keep playing and focus on the overall picture, which is getting to be able to play this great game,” said Holgorsen. “We’re excited to be in the Big 12. Each and every week you’ll have to line up and play quality teams. Our preparation this week going to No. 2 Baylor is no different than with a Top 20 team against Oklahoma State or Oklahoma. It’s what everybody signed up for. We’re excited about it and we’re going to go play football.” \nAlthough Holgorsen would probably take another Maryland game to rebuild confidence and fix some problems if he was offered, that’s not going to happen and Baylor does present a big opportunity for the struggling Mountaineers. If WVU can find some way to pull off the upset — as it did last year in Morgantown, the Bears’ only loss of the regular season — the two early conference losses would quickly be forgotten. \nBut such an outcome may be easier said than done. Baylor has become one of the Big 12’s most dominant teams over the last few years under head coach Art Briles, and Holgorsen agreed with Briles’ assessment that this year’s team might be the best he’s had. \nThe Bears will enter Saturday’s game averaging 64.2 points and 725 yards of offense per contest. They’ve thrown for 367.4 yards per game and run for a Big 12-best 357.6. \n“They look better to me,” said Holgorsen, comparing this year’s Baylor team to the one that went 11-2, winning a share of the Big 12 title before being edged out 42-41 by Michigan State in the Cotton Bowl last season. “They’re performing as good as you can on offense. They’re incredibly efficient. They haven’t missed a beat with the new quarterback (Seth Russell) coming in. They have a great receiving corps. The o-line is all the same guys and a year better. The run game’s clicking, so there are a lot of guys and a lot of points. \n“Defensively, they’re all the same guys, as well, a lot of experience. There’s continuity on the coaching staff.” \nKickoff for Saturday’s game is scheduled for noon Eastern from Baylor’s McLane Stadium. FOX will handle the television broadcast. \n— Email: chuffman@", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:12:53.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
