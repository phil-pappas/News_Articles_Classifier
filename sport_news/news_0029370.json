Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: What's the key for the Aggies to defeat Mississippi State? They got manhandled last season by MSU\nHairopoulos : Well, several teams manhandled A&M last season. This time around, I think A&M getting into the end zone on their big gains may be the difference. So the Aggies are having trouble in the red zone when the field is condensed? Get into the end zone on some of those 40 and 55 yard plays. Manny Diaz' defense is allowing 14.8 points per game and it kept Auburn from scoring a touchdown for the first time under Gus Malzahn.\nQuestion: What was the pct. of Aggies fans in Jerry World? Is that still a good site for this?\nHairopoulos : I wrote last week about A&M athletic director Eric Hyman saying he's constantly reevaluating the series at AT&T Stadium. Kevin Sumlin has come out and said he'd rather have an SEC West game as a home and home. Arkansas is all in on playing it there through the contract, which ends in 2024. I know Aggie fans might be sick of JerryWorld, but the games did have good atmospheres the last two years, fitting of games that went into overtime.\nQuestion: Do you think Alabama is formidable when the Aggies get them or is this a good year to beat the Tide?\nHairopoulos : Formidable. They've still got an awfully stout defense. And they can run the ball, which we've seen the Aggies are still working on. A&M does get them a week after a bye and at home, so that'll help.\nQuestion: Would you worry about LSU or Mississippi more if you were Sumlin?\nHairopoulos : Both! Both are on the road and both will be great tests. A&M at Ole Miss on Oct. 24 will be the first time A&M leaves Texas this season. A&M hasn't beat LSU yet since joining the SEC.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/chats/2015/09/23/kate-hairopoulos-answers-texas-amsec-questions-3-pm-wednesday-sept-30-ask-now?hootPostID=6a3da5c44a6a9fe3981fd7def88d217c"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:47:44.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
