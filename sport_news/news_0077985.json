They were the only other runners to break the 17-minute barrier.“They were really bad conditions,” Beavers said. “It was not a good place to (set a personal record), because the water was always ankle-deep and the dirt was all mud. I knew coming in, based on my fitness, I had a chance to take first or second. I’m just glad I was able to come out and do what I knew I could do.”Marc Reiser also scored a top-10 finish for Etowah, placing ninth in 17:14.55.
