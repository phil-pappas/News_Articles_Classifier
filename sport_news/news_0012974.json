The Ravens have already taken the first two meetings between the teams this year.\n“We’re undefeated in league again and we’re going back (to the playoffs),” said Vista del Lago coach Joshua Parsons.\nRubidoux entered the third round on Wednesday still very much in contention, trailing 7-5, but Vista del Lago captured three of the first four sets in the third to clinch the match with minimal suspense.\n“We just had to stay positive and keep the whole team motivated (going into the third round),” said No. 1 doubles player Kailee Terrill , who is yet to lose a set with partner Danielle Sanchez this season. “You want to win league and you don’t want to go home and go, ‘We could have won league, but we didn’t try hard enough.”\nTerrill and Sanchez won their three sets while only dropping one game on the day and the Ravens also got a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (5) sweep from No. 1 singles player Lahela Santiago .\nRubidoux, which still has key matches in the race for second place remaining against Banning today and San Bernardino on Tuesday, got two singles wins from Laura Pelayo .\nAlizay Ramirez and Jessica Bernal , and Marisol Serrato and Daisy Terrones also picked up two doubles wins apiece for Rubidoux.\nShiki Page won two of her singles sets for Vista del Lago, which is in the CIF-SS playoffs for the third year in a row.\n“I’m really proud of the girls; they showed great mental toughness,” Parsons said. “They used all their hearts.”\nContact the writer: grizk@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:28:02.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
