A second man connected to the assault was sentenced to three years of probation.\nThe rock-throwing assault happened in November 2012. UO distance runner Molly Grabill, accompanied by fellow distance runner Chris Brewer, was driving up I-5 when a rock larger than a baseball smashed through the windshield of her 1997 Subaru Legacy and hit Grabill in the face.\nBrewer told police he grabbed the steering wheel but was unable to keep it under control as the vehicle traveled onto the shoulder. The station wagon rolled on the freeway and came to rest facing the opposite direction.\nFollowing an investigation and tip from locals, Oregon State Police detectives identified and charged two men from Sutherlin.\nMatthew Logan McKinney, 22, was sentenced to nearly six years in prison for actually dropping the rock. Hayden Ray Tabor, 22, was sentenced to three years of probation. He faces five years in prison if he violates his probation. The two pleaded guilty in court last week.\n— Nuran Alteir\nnalteir@oregonian.com\n503-294-4028\n@whatnuransaid", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/whatnuransaid"], "published": "2015-10-22T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:02:25.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
