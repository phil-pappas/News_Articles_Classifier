(Glenn Graham, Baltimore Sun video) Glenn Graham Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun \nEvery successful soccer team has a player like Keri Mathias. A four-year varsity player and captain, she brings versatility, stability and whatever is needed to help the No. 6 Knights (12-1) win games. They have done plenty of winning in her four years. Century claimed a state title in 2013 and has won the past three Carroll County championships, sharing the crown with Manchester Valley last season. This season, the Knights have clinched the county's Hersh Division and will play in Monday's county championship game against the Cowan Division winner. \nMathias, a forward and center midfielder who has three goals and three assists, is the starting point of a potent offense. She's often the target player in the middle who then distributes outside to the team's dangerous scoring threats, Hannah Warther and Kylie Davis. Century coach Sara Figuly describes Mathias as \"tough, aggressive, and very composed in front.\" \nMaintaining a 3.5 grade point average, Mathias has committed to Slippery Rock (Pa.) University with plans to major in psychology. In addition to playing soccer year round, she's a mentor in the Special Olympics' Friends for Life program and a member of Young Life, a church youth program. \nWhat makes the team so successful each season? \nI think what makes us so successful is we're all really close, we're all goofy, we all get each other and we connect. We focus in practice and we also know when to goof off. We just click. \nWhat's it like being a captain and having that responsibility?

(Algerina Perna / Baltimore Sun) \nIt's a lot, but it's fun. It can be sad though when you need to be hard on the girls. You kind of feel like they sometimes get mad at you and you're like 'I'm sorry.' But it's best for the team and helping them and motivating them, too. I know when to be a captain and when to be a friend. \nWhat was it like winning a state title in your sophomore year? \nWe were nervous and we were excited. We just knew what we had to do and we did it. When the whistle blew, it was the best feeling. Running to the team, getting our trophies and knowing we took a state championship back to the school is something I'll always remember. It was a great feeling. \nWhat will it take to being home another one this year? \nWe want another jacket! We don't want to jinx it. We just want to keep working hard. It's just the best feeling knowing you went all out and won it all and we really hope to do that again. We all have to keep working hard and stay focused, especially in practice and when we warm up. We have to stay motivated and have each other's back. \nHow did you find Slippery Rock? \nMy mom was looking around at schools and she told me about it and then we went to an ID [college recruiting] camp. I didn't think I played that well, but [Slippery Rock coach Jessica Griggs] did. She emailed me right away and then we got in touch and she said she would like me to have a spot on the team. I was excited and just happy to be done with the college process. \nWhat was your impression of the campus? \nI loved it. It has everything I want. I met the girls when I went for an overnight visit and they were awesome. I'm just really excited. \nHow rewarding is it working with Special Olympics? \nIt's an amazing feeling, the best feeling seeing someone else happy. Just spending your time working with them and seeing them accomplish things is great. When you see them happy, it makes you happy. \nWho has been your biggest role model growing up? \nI'd say my Dad. He makes me work hard and the times I feel like I want to give up, he makes sure to say it's just a game, you have many more and you did fine. He always motivates me to do my best. \nHow does it feel to be a high school senior? \nIt's bittersweet. I've made some really close friends and it will be really sad to say goodbye, but there will be new people to meet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:44:39.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
