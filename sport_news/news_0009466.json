Cardinals no strangers to pass-happy offenses   \nLamar has played pass-happy schools like Baylor and Sam Houston State but it's Abilene Christian 's passing attack that scares head coach Ray Woodard the most. \n\"No disrespect to the schools we've played,\" Woodard said. \"But I think Abilene Christian's passing game is the best we're going to face at this point in the season.\" \nWoodard is leery of the Southland's third-ranked passing offense because of Wildcats ' redshirt junior quarterback Parker McKenzie , an all-Southland Conference honorable mention a season ago. \nMcKenzie threw for 182 yards and two touchdowns in the Cardinals' 24-21 victory last season. \n\"Abilene Christian brings one of the league's top offenses in here,\" Woodard said. \"McKenzie played really well against us last year and he has some very talented receivers to get the ball to.\" \nStopping McKenzie, whose 197.3 passing yards per game ranks second in the conference, has been secondary coach Ben Beasley 's focus this week. \nThe Cardinals' secondary has allowed 262.3 passing yards per game, which ranks eighth in the conference. \n\"(McKenzie) is a good operator back there,\" Beasley said. \"He's a veteran guy so we're going to have our hands full Saturday.\" \nBeasley's biggest concern is stopping timing patterns like the back-shoulder fade, which work well for the Wildcats because of McKenzie's arm strength. \n\"McKenzie has a great arm,\" Beasley said. \"He's one of the few guys in this league that can throw the ball to the far hash with zip, which is impressive.\" \nJunior cornerback Lloyd Julian believes the key to stopping McKenzie and the passing attack is pressuring the quarterback. \nCentral Arkansas sacked McKenzie five times in the Bears' 42-14 win over the Wildcats last week and forced McKenzie into a pressured interception. \n\"We've just got to get pressure on him and then we can control things on our end,\" Julian said. \"If we can make him uncomfortable, I think we will be doing well.\" \nCommunication will be key for the Cardinals' secondary against McKenzie. \nThe Cardinals have given up long touchdown passes to Baylor, Sam Houston State and Southeastern Louisiana, most of which have been via screen plays and slants where the secondary has been out of position. \n\"We've missed a lot of tackles,\" Julian said. \"We've had lots of guys in the area but haven't been able to finish them off. We've had some bad communication at times that we need to take care of.\" \nBeasley expects those lapses in communication to decrease as the season continues. \nThey will have to if Beasley's secondary wants to contain McKenzie. \n\"(The big plays) are just a factor of us playing too aggressive at times,\" Beasley said. \"We're never going to be where I want us to be but we're definitely improving and will be ready Saturday.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:36:02.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
