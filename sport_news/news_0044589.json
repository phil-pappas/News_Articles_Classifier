Shetler suspects there's a correlation between their friendships off the field and communication on it.\n\"We work really well together,\" she said.\n\"We all know how each other plays and we give really good passes.\"\nShetler has already committed to play at Rutgers.\nShe said she clicked with the players during her visits, and the coaches make sure everyone gets some playing time.\nAs for what she'll study, well, that may all come back to food.\n\"I think I'm going to go in undecided,\" Shetler said. \"If I don't find anything that interests me, I want to go into their business school and then after college, I want to go to culinary school and learn how to cook.\"\nAlso nominated: Lauren Dickerson of Holy Angels, Veronica Corcoran of NV/Demarest and Jessica Rogers of Rutherford for volleyball, Mia Luna of Lyndhurst for soccer and Rhiannon Novelli of Holy Angels for cross-country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:54.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
