It'll be good to get him back out there and knock some of the rust off and see where he is.\"\nSpencer Dinwiddie started and played 25 minutes before getting into foul trouble in the Pacers game, and Van Gundy had to play a few other players out of position to compensate. With Jackson back, the rotation will be a little more normal.\nAlthough Van Gundy isn't sure how many minutes Jackson will play, he'll be happy with getting his starting point guard, who signed a five-year, $80 million contract in the offseason, back on the floor.\nFor Jackson, the injury just cropped up after Friday's practice and Saturday's open practice at The Palace.\n\"I felt it Friday night once we finished camp; I woke up Saturday still a little tight,\" he said. \"I did everything to warm it up and got out there and played Saturday and kept aching and being there.\n\"It was precaution to make sure it was feeling well, with a few days' rest. I kept rehabbing with the training staff and figuring out everything. We felt good about the MRI and doing everything to make sure everything is well.\"\nJackson made a point to let the training staff know instead of trying to play through it, which may have prevented a more serious injury. Taking a few days off in the preseason is much more preferable than having to miss time once the season starts on Oct. 27.\n\"It was in the back of my mind immediately to let them to know,\" he said. \"They wanted to be cautious with my situation and make sure everything was well.\"\nRod.Beard@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter.com/detnewsRodBeard", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:15:45.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
