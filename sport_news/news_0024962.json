GORMAN The Associated Press   10:20   10:20   \nPeople: Photo Gallery: \nClick to view (6 Photos) \nNEW YORK â€” Henrik Lundqvist made 37 saves and Oscar Lindberg scored twice to lead the New York Rangers to a 5-2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets Saturday night. \nDominic Moore, Derick Brassard and Derek Stepan added a goal apiece in New York's home opener following two straight road victories to open the season. On Friday night in Columbus, the Rangers rallied to beat the Blue Jackets 4-2. \nEleven Rangers finished with at least one point. Lindberg, Viktor Stalberg and Keith Yandle led the attack with two points each. \nSergei Bobrovsky made 18 saves while Ryan Johansen and Boone Jenner scored for Columbus, which fell to 0-2 to start the season. \nAn opportunistic Rangers squad led 3-0 at the first intermission, aided by significant Columbus breakdowns in all three zones. \nLindberg opened the scoring at 1:20 by tapping a Kevin Hayes rebound past a sprawled Bobrovsky. Lindberg added his second of the game at the 5:12 mark of the first. New York's rookie center beat Dalton Prout to the top of the crease before redirecting J.T. Miller's cross-ice centering feed. \nLindberg has scored four goals in New York's first three games. He is the first rookie in franchise history to score at least one goal in a season's first three games. Lindberg also became the first New York rookie since Steven King to score three goals in the first three games of a debut season. King scored in four games in a row between Dec. 6-13, 1992. \nMoore pushed the advantage to 3-0 just 36 seconds after Lindberg's second goal. While the public address announcer was broadcasting the time of Lindberg's second score of the game, Moore tapped Jarret Stoll's goalmouth pass past Bobrovsky. \nAs strong as New York's first period was, it could have scored more if not for Bobrovsky. Stepan missed a wide-angled shot on a breakaway, and later, Bobrovsky stopped a Rick Nash penalty shot. Nash was awarded the penalty shot after being hooked by Ryan Murray on a semi-breakaway. \nLundqvist made the lead hold, allowing Johansen's first goal of the season at 4:35 of the third and Jenner's power-play tally about 10 minutes later. His best save was a diving stop on Johansen in which the puck bounced off of Lundqvist's stick and blocker pad. \nBrassard's power-play goal with 48 seconds left in the second increased New York's lead to 4-0. Curtis McElhinney replaced Bobrovsky in the third and yielded a goal to Stepan 1:26 into the period. \nMcElhinney finished with 6 saves on 7 shots. \nColumbus outshot New York, 39-29, and out-attempted the Rangers, 65-41. New York went 1 for 2 on the power play while the Blue Jackets were 1 for 5. \nNOTES: The game was the first of 17 back-to-backs for New York this season. ... William Karlsson replaced Alexander Wennberg in the lineup for Columbus. Wennberg is out indefinitely after suffering a concussion in the first period of Friday's loss to New York. ... Columbus scratched defenseman Cody Goloubef and right wing David Clarkson. ... New York replaced right wing Jesper Fast with Tanner Glass. Defenseman Dylan McIlrath and right wing Emerson Etem were scratched. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:26:07.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
