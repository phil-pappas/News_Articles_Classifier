(Photo: Derick E. Hingle/USA Today) \nBATON ROUGE – If – and maybe it is a when situation – Leonard Fournette breaks the school rushing record of 250 yards against a reputable Southeastern Conference school like a South Carolina, an Ole Miss or a Texas A&M, he can thank linebacker Deion Jones that he will not go in the record books for doing it against the likes of Eastern Michigan. \nFournette had carried the ball five straight times for 43 yards at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth quarter with an 11-yard touchdown for a 37-22 lead with 14:09 to go in LSU's 44-22 win over Eastern Michigan on Saturday. He had 233 yards on 26 carries. He was just 18 yards away from breaking the record. One or two more carries on the next drive, and it was likely his. \nBut Jones intercepted a pass on Eastern Michigan’s next drive and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown and the 44-22 lead, and Fournette was done for the night. \n“Maybe they would’ve kept him in, I don’t know,” Jones said. “You never know. Maybe he would’ve got the record.” \nFournette spoke to Jones after the game. \n“No, he wasn’t mad. He was actually happy for me,” Jones said. “He was cheering me on. He’s really an unselfish person. He’s just happy for everybody. That’s what I like about him. He just wants to play the game and play with us. And I feel like he could care less about the record.” \nFournette, who leads the nation with 864 yards, will likely get another chance to break the school rushing record when the No. 5 Tigers (4-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) play South Carolina (2-3, 0-3 SEC) on Saturday. The game was still scheduled for 11 a.m. on ESPN in Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina, as of Tuesday night, but South Carolina officials were considering moving the game to a nearby stadium or to Tiger Stadium because of weather related issues facing the playing of the game in Columbia. Fireman Miles trying to put out the fires at LSU \nWherever the game is played, South Carolina is struggling against the run this season as the Gamecocks are ninth in the SEC and 75th nationally in that category with 170 yards allowed a game. \n“Yeah, we’ll try to be better against the run,” South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier said, but he did not sound very convincing. “We’ve not been real super against it. But yeah, we’ll do what about every team tries to do when they play LSU. Hasn’t really stopped them much yet. We’ve got to get everybody up there and try to knock down the blockers and try to get a hold of him (Fournette) before he gets in the secondary. He’s one of those backs that it’s hard for a defensive back to tackle him. When he gets in the secondary, he heads for the goal line.” \nSouth Carolina allowed 163 yards to Missouri in a 24-10 loss on Saturday. \n“I pray he gets it at some point,” Jones said. “I do pray he gets it. I’m glad I’m not on the other team. He’s always giving his teammates credit.” LSU cornerback Kevin Toliver II (2) intercepts a pass intended for Eastern Michigan wide receiver Dustin Creel (3) in the second half Saturday.
