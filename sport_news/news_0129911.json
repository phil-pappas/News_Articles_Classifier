You know, “It’s bad, but it could always be worse!”\nSeven NBA teams will open the 2015-16 season with new head coaches, but the state of the profession was relatively stable this summer thanks in part to a number of guillotine candidates managing to hang onto their jobs. Toronto’s Dwane Casey, Cleveland’s David Blatt, and Washington’s Randy Wittman all survived despite rumors and rumblings at various points of last season, while Byron Scott returns to the Lakers ’ bench despite posting the worst single-season winning percentage in the franchise’s illustrious 67-year history.\nAll told, coaching turnover decreased for the second straight season: there were 1 4 new coaches entering the 2013-14 season and nine new coaches entering last season . What’s more, there were zero true repeat offenders. The Timberwolves are the only team opening 2015-16 with a new coach for the second straight season, and they’re only doing so because of the terrible circumstances surrounding Flip Saunders’ battle with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
