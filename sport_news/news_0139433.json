Two years ago, Red Bull was unbeatable in Formula One. Now it could pull out of the sport altogether. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno) AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Red Bull team racing chief Christian Horner said Friday he's committed to trying to keep the former world championship team on the Formula One grid next year and beyond.\nAdChoices Whether he'll get the same commitment from team owner Dietrich Mateschitz is another matter.\nThe relationship between the four-time constructors' champion and Renault has collapsed this year as the team seems set for its first winless season since 2008. Mateschitz has said that Red Bull could leave Formula One if it can't be competitive.\n''Red Bull's goals and objectives in Formula One are to compete and to win,'' Horner said at the United States Grand Prix. ''And unfortunately we haven't felt like those objectives have been mirrored over the last couple of years. So therefore decisions have been taken on the philosophy of where the team wants to be.''\nMateschitz has said Red Bull it could announce its future plans by the end of October.\n''For me, (quitting) is not an option. We have to find a solution and I'm working very hard to ensure the team is on the grid and competitive next year and beyond,'' Horner said.\nBut when asked if quitting could be an option for the team owner, Horner said, ''Well, of course it is. It's his team at the end of the day.''\nHorner also confirmed Red Bull had been in engine discussions with Volkswagen, but noted the German car manufacturer has been dealing with a major scandal over emissions testing in the commercial market.\n''With their current issues, Formula One is the last thing on their mind,'' Horner said. ''There's an awful lot of speculation and conjecture about our situation at the moment. Once everything is finalized, I'm sure it will all become extremely clear.''\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:50:22.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
