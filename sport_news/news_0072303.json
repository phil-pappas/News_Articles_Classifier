(AJ Reynolds/Staff, @ajreynoldsphoto) Five things to track: UGA women's basketball kicks off Taylor Era By Chris Starrs sports@onlineathens.com – published Wednesday, October 21, 2015 Utilize Joni’s vigorous drive Several players have spoken of new coach Joni Taylor’s energetic approach, and the Lady Bulldogs are embracing that point of view. Georgia is traditionally a good defensive team and Taylor’s plan to employ a more up-tempo offensive approach could pay dividends on the other end of the floor. Stay healthy When All-SEC forward Shacobia Barbee injured her foot and was out for the duration last season, Georgia was 17-4; after her injury (and including other players’ injuries and illnesses), the Lady Bulldogs went 2-8. Keeping the versatile Barbee on the court is a must. Exploit experience Barbee, Tiaria Griffin, Merritt Hempe and Majorie Butler have started a total of 223 games for the Lady Bulldogs. That seasoning, along with the sense of urgency that comes in the career of every senior, will be invaluable. Build depth In years past, former coach Andy Landers was at times reluctant to go to his bench much (except when injury dictated otherwise), resulting in a few players logging mega-minutes and a few players developing little to no in-game know-how. Perhaps the solution lies somewhere in the middle. Stay positive Although its pre-conference schedule is no piece of cake, Georgia should be able to construct some momentum in the 13 games it plays before kicking off league play on Jan. 7 against Missouri. There will no doubt be rough patches before the Southeastern Conference tournament arrives in early March and the manner in which the Lady Bulldogs weather adversity should go a long way in defining the overall season. \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
