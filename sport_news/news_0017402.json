By JASON ROSSI - jrossi@shawmedia.com \nWEST CHICAGO – A 37 on the front nine was a nice score for Kyle Tintera. \nThe back nine was even better for the Glenbard North senior. \nTintera fired a 35 on the back nine during the Class 3A boys golf sectional Oct. 12 at St. Andrew’s for a score of 72, a total that was good for second in the sectional and clinched a second trip to the state tournament. \n“Sophomore year I went to state,” Tintera said. “I learned you have to keep your composure. You have to play your game and not worry about the other stuff.” \nIn that state trip, Tintera carded a 161 over the two-day tournament and finished in a tie for 56th place. \nIn addition to his state tournament experience, Tintera has played rounds at The Den at Fox Creek Golf Course in other tournaments, so he will be plenty familiar with the surroundings. \n“I’ve been there three or four times, so I know the layout. I know the holes where you want to not make mistakes,” he said. \nFOOTBALL \nIt started with Devion Hodges’ 89-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, which would have been enough offense for Glenbard North’s football team in its game against Lake Park on Oct. 9. \nThe Panthers added plenty of other numbers to the scoreboard in a 42-3 win against the Lancers. It was the fifth straight win for North after two losses by a combined eight points to start the season. \nLake Park responded to the Hodges touchdown with a field goal, but the Panthers (5-2 overall, 4-2 DuPage Valley Conference) answered that score with five consecutive touchdowns to put the game away. \nVittorio Tricase scored on a 1-yard run for a 14-3 lead after one quarter. Hodges had a 63-yard interception return for a touchdown before Tricase scored on a 65-yard run to put the Panthers ahead 28-3 at halftime. \nTricase (1-yard run) and Niko Falco (2-yard run) added fourth-quarter touchdowns. \nTricase rushed for 179 yards, Hodges had 37 yards on the ground, Falco finished with 24 yards rushing and Isaiah Hawkins ran for 38 yards. The Panthers gained all 264 yards on the ground. \nThe Panthers host Metea Valley (3-4 overall, 3-4 DVC) at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 16. The Mustangs are coming off a 12-6 win against Wheaton Warrenville South. \nBOYS CROSS COUNTRY \nNoah Baran was Glenbard North’s top finisher at the West Chicago invite Oct. 9, finishing eighth overall with a time of 16:50. \nMike Aguilar (14th, 17:16) and Tommy Beckler (20th, 17:35) also had strong races. Tom Savegnago and Mike Duffy rounded out North’s scoring quintet. \nKevin Push, Hayden Frank, Nate Engler, Nate Skorupa, Sean Fisher, Ernesto Tecuanhuehue, Garcia Sebastian and Was Ahmed also ran in the race for the Panthers, who finished fourth. \nGIRLS CROSS COUNTRY \nAlexia Trasha clocked a time of 20:08 and finished second at the West Chicago invite Oct. 9. \nSam Ferengul (ninth, 20:57) and Anna Marinc (10th, 21:01) also ran well, and Alex Bartkowiak and Carli Johnson were part of North’s contingent of scoring runners. \nKimmie Nunez, Elelta Sisay and Rachel Greene also ran in the race as the Panthers finished second. \nBOYS SOCCER \nAfter a 2-1 overtime loss against Lake Park on Oct. 6, Glenbard North earned ties against South Elgin (1-1 on Oct. 8) and Glenbard East (2-2 on Oct. 10). \nThe No. 2 seed in the Class 3A Wheaton Academy sectional, the Panthers start postseason play Oct. 20 when they will face either York or Wheaton North at 4:30 p.m. in a semifinal of the Addison Trail regional. Wheaton North topped Glenbard North on Oct. 1, handing the Panthers their first DuPage Valley Conference loss of the season. \n– \nWhat: Class 3A boys golf state tournament \nWhen: Oct. 16 and 17 \nWhere: The Den at Fox Creek Golf Course, Bloomington", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:49:14.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
