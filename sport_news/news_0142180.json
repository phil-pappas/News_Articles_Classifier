(Getty Images) By Alex J. Jankowski \nThe New York Times published a feature Thursday looking at the New York Jets and how they are preparing for this week's trip to London to face the Miami Dolphins on Sunday at Wembley Stadium. \nAnd nobody will accuse the Jets of being underprepared. \nAccording to the article, the team shipped -- and not \"shipped\" as in using UPS, but placed on an actual ship -- more than 5,000 items, including 350 rolls of toilet paper to replace England's \"thinner version.\" \n\"Some may say that's a little over the top or whatnot, but it didn't really cost that much, so why not?\" team senior operations manager Aaron Degerness said. \"We're basically trying to replicate everything that we're doing here over there.\" \nThe Jets will practice at the London Irish rugby club. Field equipment will be provided by the NFL, but the team is planning to pack three full sets of gear -- hopefully packed separately from the first two if they get lost in baggage claim.
