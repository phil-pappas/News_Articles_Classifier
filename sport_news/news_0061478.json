Simington went 35-0 as a junior in winning the 4A 160-pound title. ( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nMuch like the past two seasons on the wrestling mat, Parker Simington was looking for it all in terms of his future. \nWith numerous opportunities awaiting the Thompson Valley senior, Simington found all he was looking for at the Air Force Academy, giving coach Sam Barber his verbal commitment. Unlike the process for most Division I athletes, Simington will not sign a letter of intent, but will officially become a cadet when his appointment is finalized. \n\"I chose Air Force because I think it's the best fit for me. It will give me a good chance to expand on my leadership and turn me into the person I want to be,\" Simington said. \"The coaching staff and the wrestlers there were amazing people, and I think it's a great fit for me. \n\"I think it will really bring out all my best characteristics. It will make me focus on leadership, turn me into the leader I want to be. It will bring out integrity, and it will really question my work ethic. It's going to take a lot, but I'm looking forward to it for sure.\" \nSimington enters his senior with a career mark of 118-17 and a three-time state placer. He won state titles the past two seasons, going 35-0 as a junior in winning the 4A 160-pound crown. \nTVHS coach Dave Juergensen wasn't surprised when Simington asked to meet with him in his office and tell him of his decision. Juergensen felt Simington was looking for a place that would challenge him beyond the norm, so his final choice was no surprise. Advertisement \n\"From what I've gathered, I think he's looking for a place where he can be competitive wrestling, but at the same time set himself up in the best possible way for his future,\" Juergensen said. \"I think he can get more out of the Air Force Academy than he can at any other college in his mind.\" \nSimington went to a team camp this summer, then later took an official visit to the Academy. In both instances, he was impressed with the family atmosphere of the program, not just among the wrestlers, but the coaches included. One aspect that stood out was the supportive nature of the team. \nHe also knew a couple of members of the team from wrestling in Colorado, including former Loveland grad Sam Kreimier. \n\"I think I'm blessed to have this experience,\" Simington said. \"I'm looking forward to getting a world-class education. I'm going to enjoy being at the Academy, I'm going to enjoy wrestling for them and I'm going to put everything I've got into it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:17:16.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
