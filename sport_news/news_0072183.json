Following a post-game meeting near their bench, they put their helmets up and said, \"One, two, three — playoffs!\" \nA third straight victory improved the Sabers to 4-3 overall and 3-2 in division, with a game against winless Oneonta High ahead to close their regular season to make it official. \n“I'm ecstatic,” hard-hitting inside linebacker Justin Wheeler said. “It was a little more work at the end, with the snap, or whatever was going on. Had us all kind of freaked out on the sideline.” \nAstute description. \nHere's what was going on: Holding a 19-14 lead, SV stops the Warriors inside its 10 and takes over on downs with 45.8 seconds left and CV with two timeouts remaining. Quarterback Cameron Manchester takes a knee on first down, CV calls timeout with 42.2 ticks left. \nSame thing happens on second down, only this time, no time runs off the clock. An official tells CV coach Jay Hope to run three seconds off the clock. Hope signals to the press box to do just that, so the clock starts to run and just keeps going, well past three seconds. Hope then says to the officials to keep the time on the field. On third down, Manchester kneels again, at the 5-yard line. \nAt that point, SV coach Mike Ford said he notified an official he wanted to run the play clock down to one second and take a timeout, with around 14 seconds left. Well, that message never made it to the field. The Sabers snapped the ball, a fumble ensued and suddenly, those who remember “The Miracle in the Meadowlands” must have had thoughts of former New York Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik running through their heads. The ball rolled free in SV's end zone for several seconds and numerous players on both sides had chances to recover it before the Sabers' Brandon Vosbury fell on it for an apparent safety. \nTurns out, none of that stuff really happened, though no whistles blew while it all occurred. \n“It was not ready for play,” Warriors coach Jay Hope said of the non-play, “so they snapped it without it being ready for play.” \nBut it took about 10 minutes to sort all that out. \nHope, Ford and the officials talked and talked and talked, and when they finished it was determined that SV would be flagged for an illegal snap, moving the ball back to its 3. \nManchester then took an intentional safety as he was tackled in the back left-corner of the end zone by Chris Vegiard with about 12 seconds to go, bringing the score to 19-16. \nOn the ensuing free kick, the Warriors tried a couple of laterals before a game-ending tackle near midfield. \nGot all that? \nBefore all that, an outstanding game featuring big hits on both sides took place. \nSV scored first, a 50-yard drive on its opening possession that included a 29-yard run by Vosbury. Zach Knewasser capped it with a 5-yard scoring run, taking a toss left, cutting it back and scoring easily. Tim Hawley's extra point made it 7-0. \nJust before halftime, CV tied it on a 64-yard drive that included 5-for-6 passing accuracy by Mark Mullins. He hit Nick Pert in the left flat on a play that covered 19 yards to SV's 18. Three plays later, Mullins faked a give to Aaron Trumino and ran through a big gap on the right side for a 5-yard touchdown run. Pert's PAT made it 7-7, 50.7 seconds before halftime. \nOn its first possession of the third quarter, CV drove 49 yards for a touchdown. The big play was a beauty of a pass by Mullins on third-and-6. The ball traveled about 30 yards down the left side, over an SV defender and into the arms of Vegiard for a 37-yard gain to the 8. Four plays later, Trumino just got over the line on a fourth-and-1, and Pert's extra point gave CV a 14-7 lead. \nSV answered right back on a drive jump-started by a 41-yard keeper by Manchester. He zipped around the right end and kept driving his legs as he met resistance about 30 yards into the run. Nine more penalty yards were tacked onto the end on a late hit, moving the ball to CV's 9. \nFollowing a big lead block by Vosbury, Knewasser scored from 8 yards on third down. Hawley's PAT attempt was a yard short and CV still had a 14-13 lead with 3:12 left in the third quarter. \nAfter a Warriors punt, SV's next drive started at it 41. Three big plays highlighted the scoring drive, including a 38-yard run by Vosbury up the middle and a 10-yard completion from Manchester to Knewasser in the right flat to CV's 8 that set up a third-and-4. \nVosbury carried on the next play, but came up just short of a first down. Manchester then took a sneak for a yard on fourth down for a first down at the 3. The next play saw Manchester sneak again, this time just reaching the ball over the goal line as SV took a 19-14 lead. \nWhen CV set up for the ensuing possession at its 33, 7:39 remained on the clock. Mullins hit all five of his passes on the drive, the biggest a 29-yarder to Sam Trebilcock, who made a nice adjustment on a ball slightly behind him at SV's 41. \nLater, Trumino bulled his way for 9 yards and CV had a second-and-1 at SV's 9. The Warriors tried to pass, but Vosbury came through untouched and sacked Mullins for a 9-yard loss. \n“I had a hole and just knew we had to do something to make them lose yards,” said Vosbury, who also carried 15 times for a game-high 140 yards. \nMullins hit Matt Slezak on the left side for 8 yards, setting up a fourth-and-2 from the 10. CV called timeout with 50.5 seconds left. Mullins called his own number on the next play, a sneak that came up a half-yard short. \nMullins finished 14-for-20 for 140 yards, even better than it sounds when one factors in the harsh wind with which he had to contend. \n“He throws a nice ball and our receivers made some nice catches today,” said Hope, whose team is 5-2 and finished Division III play at 5-1, with a game at rival Chenango Forks ahead in Week 8. “We had to throw today because they were getting us pretty good up front.” \nWheeler and Vosbury led a linebacking group that continually stuffed CV ball carriers, holding the Warriors to 84 rushing yards on 32 attempts. \n“I would like to take credit for that, but that's the big guys up front,” Wheeler said. “They open the holes and we can get there pretty quick when we're untouched.” \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob 186 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1LBkpUG TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:17:29.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
