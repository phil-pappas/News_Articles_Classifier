While suggesting a graceful exit for leaders in the 70-plus category, the senior Congress leader emphasised that the transition process would be smooth and that Rahul will not treat seniors the way Modi treated his seniors in the party. “There is (will be) no bloodbath (when Rahul takes over). I don’t think Gandhi will treat the seniors the way Modi has treated the seniors. Modi has sent (LK) Advani), Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh... everybody to Siberia,” the Congress Rajya Sabha member told PTI in an interview here. Earlier this year, the former Environment Minister expected Rahul to take over as party president in 2015 but now says it’s taking time as the latter is busy picking his team and shaping the structure of the party under him. Ramesh said when Rahul assumes charge, it’s not one individual taking over; it’s a whole team being put in place. “So, he (Rahul) has been spending a lot of time figuring out the structure plus the people. Structure without the people is meaningless, and the people without structure is not very useful. So, from what I gather in the past few months he has been devoting time to finalising the structure as well as the people to fill that structure”. On when Rahul would take over, he noted that “(calendar year) 2015 is not yet over” and said it’s certain to happen by March (next year) at the most but added that only two people – (Sonia) Gandhi and (Rahul) Gandhi, as he put it – know the exact time-line. The expected change of guard in Congress leadership is “undoubtedly” a generation shift, seen for the first time after Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1984 following the assassination of his mother Indira Gandhi, Ramesh said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:04:10.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
