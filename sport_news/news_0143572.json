Chris Perkins Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Dan Campbell develops a new, rugged practice drill \nDolphins interim coach Dan Campbell has done it again. \nCampbell, who has had his players compete in mid-practice 1-on-1 drills, first-team offense vs. first-team defense drills, and even a tug-of-war, devised another interesting practice tactic Wednesday. \nThis time, young players had to battle their way out of a circle of veteran players. \nCampbell, who once said he wanted his players to “violently compete,” gathered his team at midfield after calisthenics and before the actual practice began. \nThen all heck broke loose. The scene resembled a giant rugby scrum. \nCampbell had the young players get in the middle of a circle. They were surrounded by veterans. Then the youngsters find their way outside the circle as veterans tried to keep them herded inside. Have Dolphins transformed from finesse to physical team? \nX's and Omar: Sun-Sentinel's Omar Kelly and CBS 12's Matt Lincoln discuss the Dolphins situation as they prepare for the Texans. \nX's and Omar: Sun-Sentinel's Omar Kelly and CBS 12's Matt Lincoln discuss the Dolphins situation as they prepare for the Texans.

That’s all it was, it just created a little bit of energy. \n“Not that we needed it, you just don’t want to take the chance. I wanted to make sure we had energy going into the practice and that just helps a little bit.” \nCampbell said the drill wasn’t anything he’d done or seen before. Campbell still stirring things up at Dolphins practice \nDolphins interim coach Dan Campbell challenged his young players to break out of a circle of veterans early in practice Wednesday as he found another way to keep the enthusiasm going. \nDolphins interim coach Dan Campbell challenged his young players to break out of a circle of veterans early in practice Wednesday as he found another way to keep the enthusiasm going.

So that was what I came up with. \n“Anyway, it was good, they enjoyed it. And it’s fun. They’re just messing around with each other.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:25:52.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
