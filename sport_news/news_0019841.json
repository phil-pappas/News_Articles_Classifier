It was essentially good-natured fun while they watched film of LeGarrette Blount ’s 34-yard run in the fourth quarter, as Mason found himself sprinting for nearly 40 yards without anyone to block.\n“Yeah, we definitely did (have a laugh),” Mason said. “It was just the O-line joking about me being downfield and all that type of stuff.”\nMason, who lined up at left guard, pulled around the right edge to lead the way for Blount. But because Rob Gronkowski , Michael Williams and Julian Edelman , who blocked two Cowboys by himself, set the edge so flawlessly, Mason essentially pulled a “Forrest Gump” and just kept running.\nThe play started at the Patriots’ 48-yard line. Mason chipped cornerback Corey White at the edge, perhaps out of boredom, and encountered safety J.J. Wilcox at the Cowboys’ 42, but Wilcox wanted nothing to do with that engagement, turned back down the field and attempted to cut off Blount’s angle. As Blount went out of bounds, Mason eventually planted Wilcox inside the 20-yard line.\n“When that happens,” Mason said, “you just keep your eyes open and look for something to do. I just kept running.”\nBecause of the blocking by all involved, it turned into the Patriots’ longest running play of the season, bettering the previous high by 12 yards. It was also the latest example of Mason’s athleticism, as the rookie didn’t look out of place while sprinting down field. The Patriots pull their linemen frequently in the run game, and Mason has been very good in that aspect.\nOccasionally, that means Mason will find himself head-to-head with a much smaller defensive back a long way from home.\n“I don’t know what’s going through their heads,” Mason said with a laugh. “That’s really just the way it all played out.”\nA needed High note\nNeeding some positive injury news yesterday in the wake of Nate Solder ’s season-ending torn biceps, the Patriots got it in the form of linebacker Dont’a Hightower , who was a limited practice participant after injuring his ribs against the Cowboys.\nHightower was decked out in full pads and wasn’t wearing any noticeable protection over his ribs, which was a positive development on the surface. Then again, it’s possible Hightower didn’t need the additional protection because the Patriots had no intention of keeping him on the field for team drills.\nThe extent of the injury remains unclear, but Hightower was listed on the practice participation and injury report with “ribs.” The Patriots announced during Sunday’s first half Hightower was questionable to return with a “rib” injury, as in singular. Maybe this is a case of taking things too literally, but it’s certainly plausible further testing revealed additional damage. Either way, Hightower proved his toughness last season by playing with a torn shoulder labrum for two months, so his threshold for pain can’t be underestimated. . . .\nOffensive lineman Ryan Wendell , who has yet to play in 2015, was removed from the injury report. He’d been listed with an illness since Week 2.\nFantasy Island\nOn average, Dion Lewis went undrafted on just about every major fantasy website this season. He is now the sixth-ranked running back in half-point per reception leagues despite the Pats already having their bye week. Therefore, he has been one of the most valuable assets in fantasy football this season.\nSo has Lewis heard from any friends or family who have humorously thanked him for his services?\n“I don’t pay attention to that stuff,” Lewis said. “I just come to work every day and try to get better.” . . .\nBill Belichick was noticeably dealing with a head cold yesterday, which prompted a lighthearted inquiry about his availability for practice and Sunday’s game.\n“I don’t think we have to list the coaches,” Belichick said of the injury report. “Day to day.”\nAdams dead at 67\nThe Patriots announced that former guard Sam Adams died at the age of 67 in Houston. Adams played left guard from 1972-80, opposite John Hannah for eight years.\n“This is really sad news for Patriots fans who enjoyed watching Sam Adams play,” owner Robert Kraft said, “and for the many Patriots teammates who played with him throughout the 1970s . . .\n“My thoughts and prayers are with his family and all the friends who are mourning his loss.”", "external_links": ["http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonherald/obituary.aspx?n=sam-adams&pid=176113889"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:25:08.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
