Mary Fallin, an Oklahoma State alumnus who attended the homecoming game. The university's homecoming is a major celebration, drawing more than 80,000 alumni, fans and area residents downtown. A pep rally before the game was cancelled, said Noble, who was the parade's grand marshal. \n“Our hearts and prayers go out with those who lost loved ones today, to those that were injured in the tragedy,” Fallin said during a halftime press conference Saturday. \nNoting other tragic occurrences, both in the state of Oklahoma and with the Oklahoma State University community — including two plane crashes in 2001 and 2011, involving the men’s and women’s basketball programs, respectively — Fallin added: “One thing I do know about Oklahoma people. They’re strong. They’re very compassionate. They believe in prayer. They believe in comforting people and helping during a time of crisis and need. We’ll get through this again. But certainly it’s a very painful experience for those of us here, and certainly for all Oklahomans.\" \nParamedics and firefighters participating in the parade were able to assist the injured immediately, authorities said. \n“The Cowboy family pulls together,\" said university President Burns Hargis. \"Unfortunately, we’ve had to do it before, and we're going do it again.” \nPHOTOS: OKLAHOMA STATE PARADE CRASH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:48:11.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
