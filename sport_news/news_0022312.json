Of course experience is an important point, but not the most important for me.\" \nLewandowski, linked with a move to Liverpool in several Sunday newspapers, did not come through the Dortmund youth ranks but was little-known outside Poland when he joined from Lech Poznan. \nKlopp said: \"The biggest satisfaction you can get is when you take a player from Poland, from a small club, and watch him playing today. \n\"The difference between that player and the player he is today is unbelievable. I'm not self-confident enough to think I have had the only role in his development, but of course I did play a big part. \n\"We all know the best players of today. Tomorrow we don't know, so we can work for this.\" \nThat work could take a while though, according to Klopp, who has warned expectant Liverpool fans not to expect miracles. \n\"I am not Jesus,\" he said. \"If some people make me out to be like Jesus, then the next day they will say 'OK, he's not able to walk on water'. Then there is a problem. \n\"For so many years Liverpool fans have been waiting and I understand they lose patience, but it doesn't work like that. We cannot change the whole world in one day.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:49:09.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
