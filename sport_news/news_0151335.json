The goals they give away, you've got no chance of winning any big game if you defend like that. \n“I think there's certainly a weakness to the group, they look like they lack characters, leaders and winners. \n“I enjoy watching Arsenal, I think they're great to watch, particularly going forward. But part of football is, unfortunately, is defending. And mentally, they're weak.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:32:51.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
