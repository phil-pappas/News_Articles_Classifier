Live coverage is on ITV 1 and UTV. Radio commentary of the match will be available on BBC Radio 5 Live. \nOverview \nEngland became the first team to qualify for next summer's European competition in France. After a disappointing spell in the 2014 Fifa World Cup in Brazil, Roy Hodgson saw his men bounce back as his side are in fine form. \nThe Three Lions have not lost a match in all competitions, and in all the matches they have played after the World Cup, they have settled for a draw only on two occasions. England have also won all of their eight Euro 2016 qualifiers and sit top of the table. \nHodgson will be hoping England can continue their impressive run and seal another victory at home. He will be without his captain Wayne Rooney after the Manchester United star picked up a late injury. Roy Hodgson's England contract will expire next summer Getty \nMeanwhile, Estonia still have a chance of progressing to the Euro 2016 and for them to keep their hopes alive, they have to not only defeat England, but also hope that second place Switzerland lose their qualifier fixture. A draw for the Swiss could be a blow for the visitors. \nA defeat for Estonia against the English side will clearly end their chances of progressing to the finals of the European championship. It will be difficult to defeat England, who have conceded only three goals in the eight matches played so far. \nBetting Odds (888Sport.com)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:30:52.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
