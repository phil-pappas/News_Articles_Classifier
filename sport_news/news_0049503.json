On defense, they run a 5-2, cover-zero all the time. It's simple, and they beat you with their physical ability and prowess. They do a great job of building those guys up in the offseason.\" \nCabot is led by veteran coach Mike Malham, who has earned 281 career wins at the school. The Panthers are 7-0 overall and 4-0 in the 7A/6A-East, including an impressive 34-3 victory over North Little Rock. \n\"We played Cabot back when I was in high school, and they played the same offense and defense,\" Joyce said. \"I've never seen them have that quarterback that can do what this one does. This is the first time where you might be able to say 'the best athlete in the conference is Cabot's quarterback.' This kid is a great option quarterback. He's elusive and fast, but can run you over if he needs to.\" \nThe Panthers' offense has outscored conference opponents 167-58 through just four games. \n\"We're going to try to stop the run up the middle first,\" Joyce said. \"Their option play is their alternative, so we're going to try to get him to pitch the ball. That's easier said than done. We want that because that gets away from what they want to do. They want to get behind those big linemen and pound you. If they get outside, they're getting further away from their strength. A lot of quarterbacks, when they're on the edge, at the first sign of pressure they pitch it. This kid will keep it, cut it up or spin. You have to tackle him to make him pitch it.\" \nLacking size in the trenches, the young Bombers will look to expand their offensive strategy against Cabot. \n\"To score points on Cabot, you have to take some shots,\" Joyce said. \"Or you have to be able to physically run them over. In the pass game, those outside techniques are screaming off the edge. You have a five-man pass rush every down. You have to be able to protect the quarterback long enough.\" \nIn last week's 49-14 loss to Marion, the Bombers struggled to stick the ball in the end zone after numerous trips within the Patriots' 20-yard line. The Bombers have improved on special teams, including handling an area of the game with which Joyce was concerned going into the Marion matchup.

The Bombers still have one 6A opponent on their schedule — next week against Searcy — to try to gain a playoff berth, so the Marion game is no longer in their minds, according to Joyce. \n\"The kids realize how hard they've worked,\" he said. \"The seniors know they have 12 more practices left coming into this week. They have three pregames, unless they beat Searcy. You don't have to remind them. Football season takes forever to get here, then it just flies by. You get in a routine and before you know it, it's week eight. The way we practice, we don't have time to think about it.\" Read or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/sports/2015/10/22/bombers-face-league-leader/74405286/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:38:36.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
