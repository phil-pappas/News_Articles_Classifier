Is it a triumph of such small proportions that you sneer at it and bemoan the fact they ended up back of the Royals?\nYes, manager John Gibbons decided to give his regulars a day of rest following their clinching of the AL East pennant. They deserved it. They earned it.\nRELATED:\nWin over Nats turning point for Jays\nAttention turns to playoffs after loss\nPrice wants to break playoff cycle\nJays release video to rally fans\nAll hope for finishing ahead of Kansas City ended in the penultimate game in a blown save by rookie Roberto Osuna, a game that ended in a walkoff victory for Tampa Bay.\nThe following day, Sunday, there was not a player on the Jays that didn’t agree with Gibbons decision to start Mark Buehrle and give him a shot at finishing the season with 200 innings pitched.\nBuehrle would not be part of the post-season roster and the players all knew it. This was to be his moment, his parting shot and not one player on the team would have had in any other way. They lost, but so what. Get over it. Move on.\nThe Royals won that day as well negating any controversy over starting Buehrle.\nHowever that logic doesn’t appease the bitching and moaning that would follow.\nSo the Jays end up having to play against the Texas Rangers instead of the winner of Tuesday night’s wild-card game between the New York Yankees and the Houston Astros.\nAre they really that easier pickings, pushovers? At this time of the season there are no easy teams to play, including the Yankees, who tailed off sharply over the final week.\nThis is a season to cherish after so many seasons of mediocrity, so many seasons of being second rate.\nHave you forgotten all the magic moments produced by The Bringer of Rain Josh Donaldson? All the big home runs supplied by Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion? Did you close your eyes during all the dazzling catches and defensive gems supplied by Kevin Pillar, Ryan Goins and Donaldson?\nDo you think that the arrival and dominance of David Price was a mirage?\nDid the re-appearance of Marcus Stroman to the rotation and the energy he supplied not lift your spirits?\nDo you think the Texas Rangers woke up saying: ‘Boy, are we ever happy we’re playing the sad-sack, no-talent Blue Jays and not one of the other teams?’\nThe Jays, despite not having the best overall record, are still listed as the team to beat by the sharp guys who set the odds. According to both Bodog and SportsBettingDime.com the Jays are the favourites to win both the American League and World Series.\nWhy do you have such little faith?\nIs it all about being a Canadian and feeling second rate to the United States?\nCan you not simply stand up and proclaim: ‘We’ve got a good team that can kick anybody’s ass?’\nOr is it that you continue to grind away with your hatred of all things connected to John Gibbons? Does he just get up your nose?\nGibbons has been a lightning rod of controversy ever since he was re-upped by Alex Anthopoulus and there are those that think he’s a knuckle-dragging numbskull who can’t put two sentences together, doesn’t know how to use a bullpen and has the worst in-game strategy of any manager that ever lived.\nYou are never going to win an argument against that crowd. Their hate is too deep set, it’s all the way to the bone.\nCome Thursday, though, playoff baseball is back in Toronto and with it will come all the joy and agony that post-season baseball brings.\nIt’s been a great ride so far.\nWhy not sit back and enjoy what will come.\nPoll Do you agree with Rutsey's column?
