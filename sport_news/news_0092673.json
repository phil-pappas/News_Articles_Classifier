AP | Abu Dhabi, October 13, 2015 | UPDATED 17:49 IST Mail A+ A- Pakistan opener Mohammed Hafeez missed out on his ninth Test century on Tuesday. (AP Photo) \nPakistan made a steady start to its opening Test match against England on Tuesday, reaching 82-1 at lunch. Post lunch, steered by Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik, the hosts have reached 171 after the loss of one wicket. Live Score \nMalik marked his first international Test in more than five years with an unbeaten half-century and opener Hafeez, who was severe against debutant leg-spinner Adil Rashid, fell short of his ninth Test century, when he was trapped in front by Ben Stokes. \nThe pair has added 166 runs for the second wicket after Pakistan lost opener Shan Masood early, undone by a slow bouncer from James Anderson in the third over of the innings. \nThe ball reared up and hit Masood's helmet as he took his eyes off the ball, before ricocheting onto his stumps. Masood was on two and Pakistan's score was on five. \nAnderson could have had his second wicket in the seventh over of the match when Hafeez prodded at an away-going delivery and edged a simple catch to Ian Bell in second slips, only for the fielder to drop it. \nPakistan made just 28 runs in the first hour, but gained some momentum in the second with the introduction of spin in the form of Rashid, who had given away 29 runs in his first six overs without posing much danger. \nEarlier, Pakistan captain Misbah-ul Haq won the toss and elected to bat first. \nThat advantage came after a major blow for Pakistan with star leg-spinner Yasir Shah unable to recover from the back injury he suffered while bowling at the nets on Monday. \nThat left Pakistan with only one spinner, Zulfiqar Babar, and Pakistan is going into the match with three seamers - Wahab Riaz, Imran Khan and Rahat Ali. \nEngland, as expected, gave a debut to Rashid on a pitch that is expected to assist the spinners from day three onwards. \nPakistan has played seven test matches at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, winning four, including the last two by massive margins against Australia (356 runs) and New Zealand (248 runs) and drawing the other three. It also won the only test match here against England by 72 runs in 2012.
