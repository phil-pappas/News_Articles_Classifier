What The Patriots' victory decided is where it will be played. Binghamton (5-2, 3-1) earned the right to host the semifinal. If it's anything like what transpired Friday at Binghamton Alumni Stadium, it should be a dandy. \nCorning (4-3, 2-2) rallied from a 33-21 fourth deficit on the strength of two John Dobson-to-Danny Madden touchdown passes. \nThe first came on a 61-yarder. Madden ran a skinny post on the left side, caught a well-thrown ball about 15 yards downfield, broke a tackle and outran the pursuit to the end zone. Vitor Mourao's extra point made it 33-28, with 10:54 left. \nBinghamton's next possession ended with Kyle Zingler interception a fourth-down pass by Petrucci. His 30-yard return up the left sidelinegave Corning possession at its 48. \nWith 8:17 left, the Hawks started on an 11-play drive. Facing a second-and-22 from Binghamton's 27, Dobson threw a highly lofted to the back end zone. Madden ran under it and kept his feet inbounds for a touchdown that tied the score and Mourao's PAT gave Corning a 34-33 lead with 3:08 to go. \n\"This is Danny Madden's first year playing football since he was a small fry,\" Corning coach George Bacalles said of Madden, a baseball standout who'll play in college for Division I St. Bonaventure. \"I love how competitive he is. John threw some great balls and we were able to use the pass, even though we don't like to.\" \nStarting on its 35 with 3:01 the uptempo Patriots turned to Young. He took an option pitch around the right end for 14 yards on the first play. A delayed handoff up the middle to Young went for 17 more to Corning's 34. Later in the drive, Young picked up 6 yards on an option left to Corning's 17 and then 11 more on the next play on a physical run up the middle to the Hawks' 6. \nOn the next play, Witherspoon, covered closely by Noah Flynn, got just enough separation and caught a perfect pass from Petrucci for the winning score. Rasheen Pettiford's two-point run capped the scoring. \nPettiford also sealed the victory with a leaping interception at midfield on a Dobson pass to the right sideline. \n\"We're a no-huddle team, so we don't always need a big play,\" Pats coach Mike Ramil said of his team's final drive. \"We can run five, six or seven plays in two minutes because of our tempo. We can make it happen.\" \nThe teams played to a 14-all deadlock after one quarter. \nCorning's Devon Sullivan scored a pair of touchdowns in the first quarter, the first on a 36-yard pass from Dobson, another high-arching pass, and the second a 1-yard run. But Sullivan suffered a right-ankle injury after a 24-yard run in the second quarter. He did not return. Sullivan accounted for 62 rushing yards and 36 receiving before the injury. \n\"It's tough whenever you lose a starter, especially someone as talented as Devon,\" Bacalles said. \nEric Fortner and Christian Sindon each scored on 2-yard runs in the opening quarter. Fortner finished with a game-high 118 rushing yards on 12 carries. \nThe Patriots took a 21-14 lead when Petrucci found Pettiford on the right side for a 12-yard touchdown play in the second quarter. \nThen Young made a 13-point spread in the third quarter on an impressive 45-yard catch and run. He caught hitch on the right side, burst forward, followed with a sharp cut across the field and then decided to point back and chasing defenders as he eased into the left corner of the end zone to make it 27-14 with 8:49 left in the third. \nCorning answered late in the quarter, when Ali Muhammad, all 155 pounds of him, ran over a Patriots defender en route to a 13-yard touchdown run. Mourao's PAT made the Hawks' deficit, 27-21. \nExploiting massive holes in the middle, Fortner ripped off consecutive runs of 25 and 15 yards on Binghamton's next drive, one that ended with a 2-yard touchdown run by Petrucci to make it 33-21. \n\"I told them before the game, you can have a home game or you can travel, it's up to you,\" Ramil said in reference to the playoff game in a couple of weeks. \nPetrucci finished 12-for-23 for 195 yards. \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1RND14O TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:13:23.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
