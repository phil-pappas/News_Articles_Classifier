The diagnosis was confirmed by several veterinarians. \nBevo XIV began his tenure as the Texas mascot at the age of 2 in 2004. He was a part of back-to-back Rose Bowl victories, including the January 2006 win that resulted in the BCS national championship. \nThe search for Bevo XV will begin immediately. It’s anticipated that Bevo XV will be on the sidelines for the 2016 football season.
