He needed less than three quarters against the Boilermakers (1-5, 0-2 Big Ten) to nearly double those numbers as he rekindled images of former Purdue star Mike Alstott. \nBrooks wore down Purdue with his powerful inside runs then broke it open by breaking tackles and outrunning the rest of the defense on the second play of the second half to make it 17-6. \nThe Boilermakers (1-5, 0-2 Big Ten) never recovered. \nMinnesota (4-2, 1-1) sealed it 6½ minutes later when much-maligned quarterback Matt Leidner fooled the defense on a 3-yard TD pass to a wide-open Brandon Lingen for a 24-6 lead. \nThe Gophers were just getting started. \nBefore the third quarter ended, Leidner threw a 17-yard TD pass to Lingen and Jalen Myrick returned his second interception of the day 27 yards for a score. Suddenly, the FBS' second-worst scoring offense put 28 points on the scoreboard in the quarter — more than it had in any previous game this season. \nMinnesota, which started the day as the Big Ten's worst rushing team, finished with 326 yards on the ground and has won three straight over the Boilermakers for the first time since 1989-91. \nPurdue has lost four straight overall, eight in a row in league play and has just two wins over FBS foes since third-year coach Darrell Hazell took the job. \nThe Boilermakers started fast, capping a 75-yard drive with a 1-yard TD run from D.J. Knox to take a 6-0 lead. \nBut after that Purdue looked every bit as inept as Minnesota was supposed to be. The Boilers didn't score again until David Blough threw a 10-yard TD pass to Cole Herdman with 4:39 left in the game. \nHow bad was it for Purdue? \nPaul Griggs' first extra-point attempt hit the left upright. Trae Hart muffed a punt near midfield when he tried to make a diving catch. Blough finished 21 of 49 for 207 yards with one TD and three interceptions, and Purdue averaged 2.4 yards per carry. \nMinnesota wasn't that much better. Leidner finished 8 of 12 for 59 yards with two TD passes and one interception, and Lingen caught three passes for 22 yards. \nBut Brooks found enough creases to keep the Gophers offense chugging along. \nRyan Santoso's 37-yard field goal early in the second quarter cut Purdue's lead to 6-3. \nMyrick's first interception gave the Golden Gophers the ball at Purdue's 37. Six plays later, Leidner capitalized with a 1-yard TD plunge that gave Minnesota a 10-6 lead. Leidner's 19th career TD run broke a tie with Sandy Stephens for the second-most rushing scores by a Minnesota quarterback. \nAnd Brooks' long run broke open the game. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:41:26.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
