New England beat NYC FC 3-1. \nWith Le Toux improving to 13 for 13 on penalty kicks, the Union (10-17-7) snapped a two-game losing streak, but missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. \nCristian Higuita collected a pair of second-half yellow cards and was ejected in the 86th minute. \nThe teams were booked for 10 cards in the game, seven by Orlando City. \nBlake, the first pick in the 2014 SuperDraft, needed five saves to collect the shutout. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:09:12.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
