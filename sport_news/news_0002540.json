I know people were trying to talk me out of it. It's a scenario where everybody in their career makes the decision that it's time for a change.”\nClint Boyer will drive the No. 14 car for SHR after Stewart steps aside.\nIn 2014 Stewart struck and killed driver Kevin Ward Jr. while driving in a a sprint car race in New York. He also broke his leg in a sprint car crash in 2013 and missed the final third of that season.\nHowever, Stewart said that those incidents had nothing to do with his decision. He hasn't won a race in two years and told the Associated Press this summer that his confidence in and enthusiasm for driving in the series were dwindling.\nBut Stewart, who has 48 Cup victories, said Wednesday that he wants one last shot at winning the Daytona 500. And the avid dirt-track racer added he's not just going to sit idle upon retirement.\n“I am still going to race,” he said. “I am not retiring from racing, just the Sprint Cup Series.”\nPrivacy Policy Auto Racing Stock Car Racing Tony Stewart Kevin Ward Jr. Stewart-Haas Racing", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c1f84/turbine/la-sp-sn-tony-stewart-nascar-retirement-20150930"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:05:59.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
