He has been in hospital for more than a week battling antibiotic-resistant staph infection MRSA, the NFL says in a press release. Doctors are doing their best to avoid amputating his foot but they may have no choice, according to the NFL, which says \"it remains to be seen if he'll ever play again.\" The team dedicated their Sunday night game against the 49ers to Fells and won it 30-27, reports the New York Daily News . \"Thank God we were able to get him a game ball,\" head coach Tom Coughlin said. \"That was some football game there tonight.\" New York Giants tight end Daniel Fells catches a pass during a joint NFL football training camp with the Cincinnati Bengals, Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2015, in Cincinnati.
