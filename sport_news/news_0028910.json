The pairing of the age-defying Chimera with an energetic, hard-nosed Tom Wilson proved to be inspired as we got to witness the speedster Chimera use his talents on defense (as opposed to his typical offensive contributions) with amazing results. \nBraden Holtby \nthe Holtbeast has been a notoriously slow starter in the past. Fortunately, that doesn’t say much considering this is only his second full season starring in goal. Didn’t allow any soft goals and made a crucial heart-stopping save on a breakaway right after a blown chance from the Caps on the other end. Moved sooo well… Like a Saskatoon tango dancer. \nTom Wilson \nPut together a solid game that showcased his offensive smarts with patient passing to go along with his hard-nosed ‘heavy” style of game that isn’t what we’ve come to expect from him night after night. His helper to Orpik while playing the penalty kill showed a veteran’s mindset with some nifty passing to the open man on the ice. \nBrooks Orpik \nOld man strength. Held his own against dirtier, shittier players. Wasn’t afraid to get in peoples faces all night and provided his first goal as a Washington Capital. \nThe 35 year old Defensive Defenseman could have come out hesitant and sluggish after offseason wrist surgery and not having played a preseason game but instead, appeared reliable as ever to go along with his shorty. \nMarcus Johansson \nOne of my favorite things about Mojo’s game is his ability to camp out in front of the net from time to time, a place his stick just in the right position to score goals whenever Ovie makes that conscious decision to fire a pass/shot so hard through the crease, that it bounces off Mojo’s perfectly angled blade for the goal. \nBarry Trotz \nI expected the home team to win tonight’s contest but would not have been surprised to see a ‘conditioned’ Devils team go all out tonight having had the luxury of playing last night.. Trotz had his boys focused from the get-go. \nMEDIUM: \nJohn Carlson \nBiggest concern was whether Carlson would be able to replicate Mike Green’s deft passing on the power play. Tonight, it looked like the Caps PP didn’t miss a beat without Green. Carlson gets a medium tonight because it looked like he spent all offseason practicing his passing and not enough with the basics of defense. He looked a touch sloppy and was caught out of position on NJ’s second goal. \nEvegny Kuznetsov \n4th line opening day stater last season to 1st ling winger tonight. LOVED his play taking over from Backstrom on the PP. His wrister from the right side circle brings another element to the PP that we haven’t seen before. He can’t let his talent go to his head, though. Had a bad hooking penalty that was reminiscent of ‘the OTHER Alex’ and seemed to pout when he was nailed for it. I’m sure Trotz will have a word about it and correct how he reacts to not getting calls. \nLOSERS: \nDmitri Orlov \nLove having Orlov back. He’s been thrust with high expectations and a lot of responsibility this season. He teased us with his speed, agility and guile tonight but it was obvious that the young Ruskie is in need of more experience and playing time after missing out on a crucial development year last season. He made mistakes but the talent is palpable. \nTJ Oshie \nHad a flawless preseason… Despite working his ass off whenever he was on the ice, he just seemed a split second late or a step behind from everyone else. It’ll get there. He gets the “loser” label tonight from me only because i HAD to put someone in the column. Ohsie’s gonna make Caps fan very happy this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:51:20.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
