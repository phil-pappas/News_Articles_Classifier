And if it doesn’t, we’re going to have fun trying.” \nThe Blue Eagles had just finished off a 2-0 win over the Paladins, with a goal and assist from Erin Spillane, one score from Alexa Buffa and over a handful of other opportunities set up by the deft, facilitating play of Sophia Gulati. \nBy their own account, though, it wasn’t a complete offensive performance, which has been the case for IHA at times this season — both in wins and losses. \n“We still haven’t found our stride yet,” Silva said. “We’re still trying to figure things out. But we’re finding it in bits and pieces. And I think it’s coming.” \nSilva is cognizant that the Blue Eagles seem to have played up — and down — to their competition through the first five weeks of the season. It’s been a much different ride than the storybook, undefeated run IHA went on last year. \nFor comparison, IHA was 13-0 through 13 games last year, and outscored its opponents, 54-1. This season, the Blue Eagles are 10-3 — albeit with the losses to national powers Maria Carrillo (Calif.), McDonogh (Md.) and Somers (N.Y.) — while outscoring their opponents, 38-12. \n“We talk about the word professionalism and the idea that you have to come to work every day with the same effort,” Silva said. “But they’re human beings and that doesn’t typically happen. There are bad days and there are good days. The soccer up here is very, very good. \n“But there are some days that mentally we’re not where we should be. It’s not how it should be, but these are 16- to 17-year-old kids we’re talking about.” \nThe bar has been raised so high, the expectations placed on it so great, it’s almost as if IHA is falling victim to its incredible success of last season. \nThe Blue Eagles, ranked the No. 1 team in the country by a national coaches association this preseason, are winning — including being 10-0 against New Jersey teams this season — but seemingly being penalized and doubted for not winning by enough. \nThat’s evident by IHA falling out of the coaches’ Top 25, despite staying competitive with the second-, third- and 15th-ranked teams in the country. \n“It wasn’t like we were outplayed by Somers and McDonogh, either,” All-North Jersey defender Shannon Burns said of two one-goal losses, including one in overtime. “They just didn’t go our way, but we were able to learn from those games.” \nThe Blue Eagles recognize that they’re not replicating the dominance North Jersey saw so frequently last season. \nNot yet anyway. \n“It has been frustrating at times,” the Princeton-bound Gulati said of an attack that is creating chances but not finishing at a consistent enough rate. \n“I think we just put so much pressure on ourselves to live up to that preseason ranking that it changed the way we played early on. We try stressing all the time that last season was last season. It’s over. Now I think we’re starting to get back, rebuilding ourselves and surely are coming back.” \nThe plan all along for the Blue Eagles has been that playing a national schedule — win, lose or draw — would pay dividends down the line. \nThe time to collect will be approaching in the next few weeks. \nThe talent, although some players are more inexperienced than others, is certainly there. The team’s confidence hasn’t wavered, either. IHA firmly believes it is ready again for the big stages to come. \nWith Gulati, Spillane and Burns — IHA’s three senior captains — standing nearby, Silva pointed and smiled Tuesday night. \n“I’m confident because of those three right there,” he said. “They won’t let [the team losing confidence] happen.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:37:40.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
