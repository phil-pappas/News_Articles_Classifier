Perine will enter Saturday's road game coming off his best game of this season, a 201-yard, four-touchdown effort in a 63-27 win over Texas Tech. \nBut good luck getting Perine - who's rushed for 621 yards and seven touchdowns this season while sharing time in the backfield with freshman Joe Mixon - to talk much about either of those performances. \n\"We watched film on (Kansas) a little bit, because they do some of the same stuff, but I try not to think much about what I did last year, because it's a new year,\" Perine said. \"They have some new players. I have to go out there and take it one play at a time and hope to do my assignments as best as I can. I guess I did a good job.\" \nWhat did Perine see when he watched the film of his record-setting performance? \"I just ran. I didn't have to do much. Those holes were huge.\" \nHow about the College Football Hall of Fame wanting his jersey after he set the record? \"Records are made to be broken.\" \nThat sort of attitude endears Perine to his teammates, quarterback Baker Mayfield said. \n\"He's an unbelievable guy,\" Mayfield said. \"He's a guy you want in your locker room. He takes care of his business. He goes about it in a quiet way. You've got to love that. He's so talented. Everybody loves that. But he doesn't say a word about it.\" \nLast year against Kansas, it wasn't Perine asking to have a shot at breaking the record - it was the Sooners' offensive linemen and coaches who pushed for him to play in the fourth quarter to give him the opportunity. \n\"I really didn't care about it too much at all,\" Perine said. \"Even after, I still don't really care much for it. I guess it's good to have on your resume and it's great. The best part about it was seeing my offensive line's reaction. They enjoyed it much more than I did. I was happy for them.\" \nDavid Beaty is in his first year as Kansas' coach, but he remembers watching Perine's performance when he was an assistant coach at Texas A&M. \n\"It was a great day for him,\" Beaty said. \"He set a record. What he did last year doesn't happen very often. As we went back and looked at the tape we contributed to that a little bit. Hopefully we can make the proper adjustments this week and try to limit him.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:49:22.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
