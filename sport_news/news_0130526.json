(AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps) (Photo: AP) \nThe 2015 NFL season has started well enough. Tom Brady is playing out of his mind. So is Aaron Rodgers. There has been drama and parity. There have been some controversies, banter, and a blossoming friendship with the Saved by the Bell cast. \nNo one has been arrested in a while either.

NFL just finished a calendar month without any player arrests reported. That hadn't happened in more than 6 years. — Mike Rosenberg (@RosenbergMerc) October 1, 2015 \nSo even though the NFL is calling a record number of penalties off the field in 2015, players are staying out of trouble off it – at least for September.
