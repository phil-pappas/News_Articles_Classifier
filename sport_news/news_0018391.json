He said Santos knew about the deal and the money was paid to his company, not directly to Neymar.\nHe said that if the player changed his mind and decided to go to another club, or if something happened to keep him from signing with Barcelona, he would have had to return the money to the Spanish club.\nThe deal came before Barcelona and Santos faced each other in the final of the Club World Cup in December 2011. Neymar was not a factor in the match and Barcelona won 4-0.\n___\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
