(AP) — Mike Peterson and Cameron Nash rushed for touchdowns as Central Connecticut State upset two-time defending Northeast Conference champion Sacred Heart 26-10 on Saturday. \nCCSU (3-5, 2-1) defenders gave up plenty of yards (373) but kept the Pioneers (4-3, 1-1) out of the end zone until late in the game. \nSacred Heart led 3-0 after an early field goal, but didn’t score again until there was 2:07 remaining. In between, the Blue Devils surged ahead 24-3 on a field goal and three touchdowns. CCSU capped the game with a safety, sacking Sacred Heart’s RJ Noel in the end zone. \nThe win was CCSU’s first on the road this season. \nNoel completed 22 of 45 passes for 272 yards but the Pioneers were unable to score for most of the game, converting just 5 of 16 attempts on third down, 1 of 5 on fourth. Tyler Dube caught 13 passes for 189 yards and the lone TD.
