In his spartan locker hung only an imposing, metal knee brace and his shoulder pads.\nDifferent styles. Different looks.\nBut the veteran offensive line has found continuity on the field if not off it. The Jets (3-1) have allowed an NFL-low two sacks in their first four games as they host the Washington Redskins on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\nAt this point last year, they had yielded nine sacks en route to 47 allowed for the season.\n\"How we’ve been able to play, I think we can dictate a little bit more [to the opposing team] throughout the course of the game,\" left tackle D’Brickashaw Ferguson said.\nHe and Colon agree that the Jets’ line is playing better than it did in 2014. But they aren’t taking credit for what Colon called \"a skewed stat.\"\nThey view the dramatic plummet in sacks allowed as the result of offensive coordinator Chan Gailey’s scheme, which plays to the Jets’ strengths: a power-run game thanks to Chris Ivory (314 rushing yards in three games) and a quick-strike passing attack orchestrated by quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. \nThe Jets allowed 47 sacks in each of the past three seasons, ranking in the NFL’s bottom 10 each time. But now returning starters Mangold, Ferguson, Colon and Breno Giacomini and former Seattle Seahawk James Carpenter are on pace to yield only eight.\n\"It’s just us playing to our strengths and doing what we do best — and that’s just getting after the guy in front of us and running the ball,\" said Colon, who is listed as questionable with a sore right knee.\nThe two sacks allowed tied for the second-best start in franchise history, with the 1966 Jets yielding only one through four games, according to STATS.\nThe biggest reason for the Jets’ improved protection may be Fitzpatrick. He releases the ball in 2.76 seconds on average after the snap, the second-quickest time in the NFL, according to ESPN.\n\"His edge is that he’s so smart. He knows where the blitz is coming,\" Colon said. \"He’s a lot like [Patriots star Tom] Brady.\"\nAnd of course, there is the improved running game and new addition Brandon Marshall, who has elevated the passing attack.\nSLEEPING OWUSU: WR Chris Owusu slept through the best catch of the college football season Thursday night — even though it was his little brother who made it. Stanford’s Francis Owusu made an eye-popping, 41-yard touchdown catch, cradling the ball behind the back of defender Jaleel Wadood — who was face-guarding him — in a victory over UCLA. Francis did it despite not being able to see the ball.\nChris realized he missed something special when he awoke thirsty at about 4:40 a.m. and noticed several text messages waiting for him.\n\"It was as unbelievable as everyone said it was,\" Chris said. \"I watched it several times, and it got better and better.\"\nINJURY REPORT: The Redskins will be without five starters Sunday: LT Trent Williams (concussion), C Kory Lichtensteiger (shoulder, finger, neck), TE Jordan Reed (concussion) and CBs DeAngelo Hall (toe) and Chris Culliver (left knee). And star WR DeSean Jackson (hamstring) is questionable.\nJets LB David Harris (quadriceps) and RB Bilal Powell (groin) are questionable. Owusu (knee), CB Marcus Williams (hamstring) and S Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee) are doubtful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:32:18.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
