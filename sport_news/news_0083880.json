MACHESNEY PARK -- Boylan's sophomore sensation Ana Hatfield put on a singles' clinic this weekend, and Hononegah secured the final doubles match of Saturday's girls sectional tennis meet at Harlem to keep its season-long hot streak alive as well. Hatfield dominated en route to her second sectional title, losing only one game the entire two-day sectional tournament. She beat Lutheran's Kaitlyn Larson, another sophomore, 6-0, 6-1 in the final. \"I've felt pretty focused and on my game, but you never really know until you get to a tourney like state, and get going,\" Hatfield said. \"I'll try to prepare the best I can, but I feel pretty ready. I'll just take it one match at a time and try to chip away.\" Hononegah freshman Reagan Wells knocked off Freeport's Andrea Crase to take third in the singles bracket, helping to boost the Indians to the sectional team title with 22 points. Hononegah's doubles team of Meghan Davis and Erin Zanolla held off Boylan's Kenzie Barr and Kelly Cluster 6-4, 7-5 in the third-place match to lock up the title for the Indians. Boylan finished with 20 points, and needed Hononegah to lose one of its third-place matches to take the title — the Indians did not oblige. \"Whenever we needed a big win, we got it,\" Hononegah coach Bobby Price said. \"And not just today, all year long that's been happening. These girls are competitors.\" The Guilford doubles team of Carly Kasicki and Nicole Christiansen won a straight-set victory (6-1, 6-2) over Auburn's power-tandem of Meghan Mediratta and Emma Lai to win the title. Kasicki and Christiansen were overpowering in the sectional final, using everything in their arsenal to easily down the NIC-10 champs. \"We weren't sure what to expect, but we had everything working today,\" said Christiansen, who played singles at conference but teamed up with Kasicki for the state playoffs. \"This was definitely something we wanted to do before we went to state — win this tournament, against these guys.\" The state tournament will be held at different sites around the Chicago suburbs beginning on Thursday, with Buffalo Grove serving as tournament central, and the host for Saturday's finals. Belvidere North Sectional Belvidere North junior Leraaen Abbott and sophomore Kayla Vittore were the only local state qualifiers at the Belvidere North Sectional. They rallied to win a pair of tough, three-set matches Saturday to take the doubles title. Both times, they dropped the first set. They won 6-4 in the third set in the semifinals and won the title in a third-set tie-breaker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:30:58.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
