The night before, pregame stuff, just approach it like any other game.\"\nWacha said the chippiness that marked some late-season Cubs-Cardinals games that included pitchers throwing at batters, will not affect how he approaches Monday's game.\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" Wacha said. \"Just stick to my game plan going in. If that's pitching inside, sticking with it, if it's staying away, then staying with that.\"\nThe Cubs beat the Cardinals five out of nine games at Wrigley Field during the regular season, while going 3-7 against them in St. Louis.\nCardinals manager Mike Matheny knows Wrigley Field's unique qualities in terms of dimensions, wind current and fan proximity to the field could affect how he manages.\nThe Cubs returned to Wrigley on Oct. 11, 2015, for a little brunch, Bears and batting practice.\n\"You know, with the dimensions, it's just a very unique field that plays a little different than a lot of others,\" Matheny said. \"You always have to be conscious of what the wind is doing. We're always conscious, too, that things can happen here at any point in the game.\"\nYou mean something bizarre could happen at Wrigley Field in the postseason? What could possibly go wrong?\n\"Just kind of talking to our guys to just stay the course, and that kind of goes hand in hand with how those flags are blowing,\" Matheny said. \"They're blowing out â€¦ anything can happen, and no lead seems like it's enough.\n\"There have been many games that we've had here, even with the wind pretty still ... there's just crazy things that can happen at any point, and especially at the end of the game. So we just continue to tell our guys to keep the throttle down, keep playing the game, and don't take anything for granted on the positive side or on the negative side, because you know if you stay the course you've got a chance to finish this thing.\"\nHow will Matheny try to get his players to handle the big-game atmosphere?\n\"The same boring way we've been doing it all year,\" Matheny said. \"That's part of the beauty of ... you talk about is there any advantage to having experience, and guys who have been here before and been able to play in different settings. Maybe not necessarily in Wrigley, but they've been in a lot of other cities where it's a lot of excitement. Part of it is the experience of understanding as much as it's built up, that we go play the game.\"\nMeanwhile, Matheny is playing it close to the vest when it comes to naming a Game 4 starter.\n\"We're just going to look at everybody,\" Matheny said. \"We don't have to make that decision right now, and always have our options open without hemming ourselves in right now.\"\nfmitchell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kicker34\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball St. Louis Cardinals Wrigley Field Chicago Cubs Michael Wacha Jake Arrieta National League", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561aa33e/turbine/chi-ct-cubs-workout04-ct0031637632-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561b0759/turbine/chi-ct-cubs-workout05-ct0031637644-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561b3865/turbine/ct-cardinals-spt-1012-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bddd7/turbine/ct-photos-brunch-batting-practice-wrigley-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:36:27.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
