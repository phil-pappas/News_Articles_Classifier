A person with knowledge of the deal tells The Associated Press it is a four-year extension worth $44 million. It could reach $48 million with incentives. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team does not disclose contract terms. \nThe 24-year-old Henson averaged 7.0 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 18 minutes per game last season. The deal ensures that Henson will remain a core member of a young team on the rise as he enters his fourth season in the league. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:44:18.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
