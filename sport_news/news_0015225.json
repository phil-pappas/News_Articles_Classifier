The teen, now an adult, indicated that the intimate relationship began in 2014, according to a Police Department news release. \nThe investigation revealed that Wallace met the teen, who was a student at the time, while he was teaching at Inderkum High. Wallace’s LinkedIn profile indicates that he taught math at the high school. \nOn Friday, Sacramento police detectives, in conjunction with the Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office, obtained a warrant for Wallace’s arrest. He was taken into custody later in the day at police headquarters. \nThe Natomas Unified School District, in a news release Friday afternoon, said Wallace was removed from classes in May and placed on administrative leave while the allegations against him were investigated. He remains on leave and has not taught in the district during the current school year. \nNow that charges have been filed, the district will finalize its administrative investigation and proceed to terminate Wallace’s employment with the district, according to the news release. \nThe district issued a written statement saying, “Protection of students is paramount, and our teachers are notified each year about appropriate behavior around students. We cannot and will not tolerate inappropriate contact between a teacher and student.” \nInvestigators are asking anyone who may have been a victim of a crime involving Wallace to contact the Sacramento Police Department.
