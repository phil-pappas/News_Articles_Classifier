The performance will certainly be remembered. \nBut the Chiefs won't forget about the guys that stood in Albright's absence and helped the football team earn two big wins. \nSenior Jarell Jackson and junior Jake Maxwell both filled in for Albright against Middle Township and Oakcrest, making the most of their opportunities. \n“Quadir (left) big shoes to fill,” Jackson said. “Mainly just blocking is what we’re focusing on and taking care of opportunities when you get them.” \nBoth players helped out in huge ways during a 45-20 win over Middle, making the big plays that Albright seems to routinely give the Chiefs. Jackson rushed for 122 yards on five carries, including a 45-yard touchdown. \nBlocking is great, but the opportunity to get out there and score was something Jackson has “been waiting for all my life.” \nMaxwell added a touchdown of his own, a 14-yard scamper that put the game out of reach. In a 19-13 win over Oakcrest, Maxwell had three huge first-down runs, including a 25-yard run off the edge that kept the Chiefs going en route to a Sam Crouch touchdown. \n“What’s unique about the position is that it’s based on the success of the other running backs,” Maxwell said. “When I have to block for certain plays, I open up holes for (Jarell and Sam) and they do the same for me. It’s just cool working together and just to get better to win the game. \n“It’s not only just a great feeling. When I started at the position, I thought they were just going to put me in there as a blocking guy, but they’re going to give me my shots and I’m going to run as hard as I can and fall forward every single time.” \nBoth running backs will continue to get opportunities even with Albright back. Having so many options to give the ball to is a great problem to have on offense. The defense has to account for every runner and it only makes the option run that much more effective. \n“It’s very fun because when they get the ball they do good things,” Jackson said. “It takes the pressure off you and all the attention, so when you get the ball, the defense is not completely focused on you.” \nAgainst Holy Spirit, Maxwell opened up the scoring with an 18-yard pitch from quarterback Tyler Rainear, making the most of his two carries. The Chiefs didn’t have a lot of carries to give out as Crouch and Albright were busting off huge touchdown runs. \nHolding onto the ball when they get it will also go a long way towards how many carries the duo receives. Maxwell had a fumble in both games, with the latter being returned for a touchdown. \n“Turnovers can change a game,” Maxwell said. “Every day at practices we have a drill where the coaches try to smack the ball out of our hands. We just always try to stress that ball security.” \nAll that matters is that both Maxwell and Jackson have proven that they can carry the load if the opportunity arrives. Every player is important as the Chiefs try to stay in a tight race for the Cape-Atlantic League National Conference championship. \n“It means a lot (to contribute),” Jackson said. “It’s my last season so I want to go out with a bang.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:43:54.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
