Add in the fact the other two games were decided by a field goal and you can see the necessity for being proactive about his health.\n“It’s been pretty crazy, especially with the overtime games,” said Bohane, whose team is 4-1. “When I was coaching with Mike Redding at Mansfield, when we went to the Super Bowl, we’d joke about being paid more for going an extra week.\n“The fact that we’ve won all three overtime games says a lot for our kids. They’re a confident group who draw from one another.”\nThe seeds for success were planted in the opening game when Joe Bires rushed for a pair of scores and Thomas Monagle kicked a 30-yard field goal to lead Canton past Rockland, 17-14. From there, it became an issue of needing extra time to determine a winner.\nBedford (14-13), Milford (27-21) and Stoughton (22-21) have all paid the ultimate price for going beyond four quarters with Canton. Bohane gives a lion’s share of the credit to seniors Bires and Jake Ragusa, both of whom have excelled on and off the field.\n“Those two guys are the leaders,” Bohane said. “The other guys feed off those two. They have the attitude that they can play with anybody and the other players are drawing off that.”\nEven if it takes more than 44 minutes to do so.\nQUICK HITTERS : Framingham snapped a 16-game losing streak with a 9-0 victory over Brookline Friday night. Nate Martino’s touchdown pass to Tayeron Campbell in the fourth quarter broke a scoreless tie. . . .\nWoburn head coach Rocky Nelson was seconds away from his 200th win before Arlington rallied with two late scores to knock off the Tanners, 34-33. The road to 200 won’t get easier as Reading and Melrose are next on the schedule.\nSweet 16\n(Last week’s rank in parentheses.)\n1.
