MISS (2-2, 0-0) 6 p.m. Sat.\nDENTON -- Anthony Wallace charged through the middle of Iowa's offensive line Saturday and arrived just in time -- meeting a ball skittering across the turf at Kinnick Stadium.\nChasing that fumble in North Texas' game against Iowa was a situation Wallace seemed built to handle against a high-profile opponent on the big stage of a Big Ten venue.\nThe thick-built 6-foot linebacker was once a top college prospect at Skyline, traits that made him a bit of an odd fit as a public area attendant at the W Dallas-Victory Hotel in 2013.\nWallace cleaned toilets and sinks for a few months while out of football during a journey that has been anything but conventional.\nWallace signed with Oregon and played sparingly for the Ducks two seasons before returning to Dallas to be closer to family with no guarantee he would play again. UNT gave Wallace a chance, and more than two years later, his first opportunity to start a college game on Saturday, when the Mean Green lost 62-16 to the Hawkeyes.\n\"It was big, everything I have been praying for and my opportunity to show my worth to the team,\" Wallace said. \"It was a humbling experience to wait five years, but it was something I had to endure.\"\nWallace started in place of injured middle linebacker Blake Bean and could return to his backup role Saturday, when UNT travels to Southern Miss.\nWhether he starts or not, UNT's coaches and players say Wallace will be critical to the Mean Green's hopes to rebound from an 0-3 start. Wallace was elected a team captain by his teammates, who say they respect him not only for his play on the field, but also for the perspective he brings after a tough journey through his college career.\n\"Anthony is like a true big brother,\" UNT cornerback Chad Davis said. \"He always gets us going and is in front of the team talking. His energy is unbelievable.\"\nThose traits are what helped Wallace land a scholarship at Oregon. After two years of playing sparingly, family issues led him to return home.\nWallace's grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, a few other relatives became ill and his three younger siblings were growing up without him.\n\"It means a lot to have him closer to home,\" said LaKashia Wallace, Anthony's mother. \"He can come and have dinner with us and can go and see his siblings play.\"\nWallace landed at UNT, where he has found his niche.\n\"We have guys who lead by example, and others who lead by example, but also have the juice, the energy and ability to communicate that to their teammates,\" North Texas coach Dan McCarney said. \"He's one of those guys.\"\nThe role is one Wallace grew into after returning home.\n\"It's worked out,\" Wallace said. \"I was able to get back into school, work on my degree and keep playing football\n\"The journey was worth it.\"\nFollow Brett Vito on Twitter at @brettvito .\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/brettvito", "https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-01T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:15:07.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
