The trail is near Sahalie Falls, located off Highway 126 near Clear Lake Resort in the Santiam Pass area.\nMichael Roszak, of Bend, had been riding alone and heading south toward the Carmen Smith Reservoir when he hit a large boulder on the side of the trail, according to the news release. Roszak, 72, possibly dislocated or fractured his left hip in the collision, authorities said, and was unable to move.\nRoszak, of Bend, remained the trail until two off-duty Emergency Medical Technicians, also mountain biking on the trail, found him. Brandon Rigaud and Jared Nichols, identified as the technicians, stopped and administered first aid.\nAnother nearby bicyclist then rode to the Clear Lake Resort to call 911. Search and Rescue personnel carried Roszak about a mile to a trailhead at Carmen Smith Reservoir, where he was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Bend.\nThe trail is narrow and the terrain is hazardous, with lava rock, large boulders and steep drop-offs, according to the news release. Deputies and 19 members of the Linn County Sheriff's Office search and rescue team responded to help Roszak. Linn County Parks staff at Clear Lake Resort and the U.S. Forest Service also assisted.\n--Laura Frazier\nlfrazier@oregonian.com\n503-294-4035\n@frazier_laura", "external_links": ["https://www.linnsheriff.org/", "https://twitter.com/frazier_laura", "http://www.oregon.com/recreation/hike-sahalie-falls"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:34:38.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
