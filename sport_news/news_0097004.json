That always gives us a lot of momentum and always gives us juice.\" \nBradford threw for 280 yards with a 32-yard TD pass to Riley Cooper, but had three interceptions to keep New York in the game. The Giants got zero points off the turnovers. \n\"We were stagnant,\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. \"They did more with their opportunities than we did.\" \nThe Eagles (3-3) have won two straight to move from last place in the NFC East into a tie for first with the Giants (3-3). The teams meet again in Week 17. \nNeither team looked sharp in front of a prime-time audience. They combined for seven turnovers and 21 penalties. Advertisement Seahawks: The team said it is lifting the suspension of fullback Derrick Coleman that was imposed after he was arrested following a car crash. Coach Pete Carroll said it would be done as soon as possible. Once the suspension is lifted, Coleman could play Thursday night against the 49ers, but Carroll said the fullback has yet to be examined by team doctors following his involvement in the crash. \nBrowns: Johnny Manziel's in-car argument with his girlfriend could lead to punishment from the NFL. Browns coach Mike Pettine said the league plans to investigate the high-profile backup quarterback's domestic dispute last week, an altercation that raised new concerns about Manziel and his future with the club. Manziel was questioned by police in Avon, Ohio, after his girlfriend claimed he was physical with her when the two had a heated disagreement while driving on an Interstate highway. Manziel was not arrested and Colleen Crowley did not press charges. Vikings: The NFL has completed perhaps its final argument for Adrian Peterson's six-game suspension last season, the latest attempt by the league at an off-the-field victory amid a series of legal losses related to player discipline. NFL attorney Dan Nash made the pitch to a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the culmination of the league's contest against U.S. District Judge David Doty. He ordered in February that arbitrator Harold Henderson, who heard Peterson's appeal last year, overreached his authority. \nJets: Wide receiver Quincy Enunwa was suspended four games without pay by the NFL for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The suspension stems from an incident last year in which Enunwa was arrested for simple assault on his girlfriend at a New Jersey hotel. Domestic violence charges were later dropped in the case. In a statement, the Jets said they \"support and respect the NFL's decision\" to suspend Enunwa. \nSaints: The Saints have decided to make a change at kicker, releasing Zach Hocker and replacing him with former Washington kicker Kai Forbath. \nBengals: The NFL Network has apologized to Bengals players who were shown naked in the locker room during a postgame interview Sunday in Buffalo. Alex Riethmiller said a \"regrettable mistake by a production team\" was behind the video. \nTexans: The Texans are staying with Brian Hoyer at quarterback after Hoyer's strong performance in Houston's win over the Jaguars on Sunday. \"He's our quarterback,\" coach Bill O'Brien said. ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:44:39.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
