The senior has helped the Golden Eagles’ defense excel on the field and allow less than 300 yards per game to their opponents. But his main focus this season is making the postseason. \n“We’ve been short the last couple of years now, so it’s time to get to the playoffs,” he said. “It has (been disappointing).” \nMedrano said his coaching staff has set the bar high for Cardenas and his fellow seniors. They have the talent and potential to lead them to a postseason berth. \n“We expect a lot out of him, he’s a senior and we expect everything’s he’s got,” Medrano said. “I think he realizes we have just as good of a chance as anybody to be there (in the playoffs). I think he really believes he has to do everything in his power to get us there.” \nThe linebacker is a part of a group of seven returning starters on a mostly senior-laden defense. Cardenas said that most of his teammates have played together since they were kids on teams during elementary and middle school. \n“We have bonded together since we were small,” he said. \nIt’s that bond that has kept the Eagles close, and it was the summer workouts that have helped Cardenas and his teammates get where they are today. \n“We put a lot of heart and dedication into the offseason,” Cardenas said. “We were here every day.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
