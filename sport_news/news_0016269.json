The Division I playoffs start Nov. 6 with four quarterfinal games. Video: Jim Krajewski previews this week's games \nAfter hosting Galena, the Senators have a bye, then end the regular season at Douglas on Oct. 29. \nCarson sophomore Abel Carter is fourth in rushing yards with 614 on 62 carries, a 9.9 average. His older brother, Asa Carter, is fourth in scoring with 54 points. \nCarson has the No. 2 ranked offense, averaging 39.71 points per game, and No. 3 defense, allowing 14. \nBut Galena has a stout defense, ranking No. 4, and has a few weapons on offense. Notably junior Jake Berger who is third in rushing with 620 yards, a 5.54 average per carry. \nGalena dominated Douglas in taking a 56-17 win last week. Berger ran 17 times for 126 yards and a touchdown for the Grizzlies. He also caught two passes for 46 yards. Quintin Mills rushed nine times for 111 yards and three scores in the win. \nWith a win, Galena would move into the top spot in the Sierra League. \nAnd in the High Desert, McQueen is suddenly resurgent, racing past Spanish Springs last week, 55-31, for its second consecutive win. Junior quarterback Joey Cox passed for four touchdowns and was 18-of-25 passing for 281 yards. \nThe Lancers are at North Valleys on Friday. \nMcQueen’s defense is not back to the level of its glory years of the 1990s, but the Lancers are solid there, too. In the win over Spanish Springs, Jon York played inside linebacker, in addition to running back, and rang up a team-high 17 tackles. Collin Crown had 16 tackles, seven solo, one for loss, one blocked kick and an interception as McQueen improved to 4-2 overall, 2-0 in the High Desert. \nMcQueen plays at Reed next week, but can’t afford to look ahead if it wants the No. 2 seed out of the High Desert League. \nSpanish Springs (2-4, 1-1) faces another tough test when it travels to Reno (4-2, 1-1). That winner still has a shot at the No. 2 seed in the High Desert. \nReed is at Hug on Friday. The Raiders beat North Valleys last week and had 418 yards rushing, led by quarterback Matt Denn with six rushes for 112. \nReed senior Jorden Carter leads the league in rushing with 896 yards and Denn is next with 861. \nManogue is at Damonte Ranch (2-4, 0-1) on Friday. The Mustangs are coming off a 49-19 loss to Cathedral Catholic from San Diego, but they should handle a young Manogue team. \nThe Mustangs runners were held in check, but freshman quarterback Cade McNamara was 18-of-26 passing for 197 yards and a score. The Mustangs have the third-ranked offense in the North \nDouglas (1-6, 1-1) has a bye this week. \nFriday’s Games \n7 p.m., McQueen at North Valleys; Reed at Hug; Spanish Springs at Reno; Bishop Manogue at Damonte Ranch; Galena at Carson; Sparks at Lowry; Dayton at Wooster. Bye: Douglas. \nFootball", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:09:09.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
