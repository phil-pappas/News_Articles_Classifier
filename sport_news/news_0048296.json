Croatia are ahead of us in the FIFA rankings but we are ahead of them in the group standings. It's a system that I have difficulty understanding.” \nNorway, who beat Malta 2-0 at home, are currently second on 19 points, but could still drop into the playoffs following Croatia's 3-0 victory over Bulgaria. \nCroatia have 17 points with one match to play, and will be confident of beating the winless Maltese away on Tuesday. \nShould unbeaten Italy be seeded for the Euro 2016 group stage draw, they will avoid the likes of hosts France, champions Spain, who beat them 4-0 in the Euro 2012 final, and England in the first round. \nAhead of Euro 2004, the Italians were not seeded and fell in the first round after finishing third in their group. \n“We are now expected to perform in the match that will enable us to finish top of the group,\" goalscorer El Shaarawy said afterwards. \n“A positive result and being seeded top would be very important for us.” — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:37:21.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
