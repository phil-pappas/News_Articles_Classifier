Kinnelon might be flying under the radar once again with the state tournament fast approaching, but it won’t be sneaking up on anyone this time around.\nThe Colts are the reigning Group 1 champions, winning it all last fall while coming out of the North 1 bracket as an unheralded No. 6 seed, defeating New Milford and Park Ridge along the way. A familiar face took over the program this season in Steve Racine, one of the nation’s winningest coaches, who entered the year with 539 career victories.\nRacine roamed the Kinnelon sideline from 2003-11 after a successful career at Morris Catholic. He guided the Colts to a Group 1 title in 2006.\nThis season there are other contenders with gaudier records, but the Colts are back in almost the identical position they were in a year ago.\nA loss to Roxbury in the Morris County tournament semifinals last season dropped them to 11-5. Kinnelon then rattled off nine straight wins to capture the program’s second state title — the first since Racine guided them to one nine years ago.\nThese Colts were eliminated again by Roxbury in the MCT semis Sunday. They fell to 11-5-1 and are now seeking another lengthy winning streak.\nShould Kinnelon go on another storybook run, seniors Ida DiClemente, Julia Kleczkowski and Emily Kapr likely will be at the center of it all.\nDiClemente, the Villanova-bound midfielder, is the team's leading scorer with 20 goals after bypassing her junior season to focus on club soccer. As a sophomore, DiClemente, whose sister Ingrid is a sophomore player at George Washington, has posted 11 goals and 14 assists.\nKleczkowski has added 15 goals and a team-best 16 assists, proving to be one of the top playmakers in North Jersey on a Colts team that has played defending Group 4 champion Montclair and undefeated Somerville tough this season — both 2-1 losses.\nKapr, Kinnelon's standout goalie, recently became the program record-holder for most career shutouts.\nThe Colts are hoping for a bit of déjà vu in the coming weeks and have the talent and coaching pedigree to make it happen.\nBut this time, a postseason run wouldn't surprise anyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:33:01.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
