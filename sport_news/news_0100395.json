They lost 11 of 14 last season, leaving them 30-62 all-time. \nNone of that mattered on this late October night when the Flyers beat Rangers superstar goalie Henrik Lundqvist on one of his best nights. \nALSO: Flyers terrified when realizing Raffl wasn't faking bench collapse \nLundqvist made 46 saves to get the Rangers into the shootout, but was beaten in the skills competition on the first two shots coming his way, roofed backhanders by Gagner and Claude Giroux off moves Flyers defenseman Mark Streit called \"sick.\" \nUp 2-0 quickly in the shootout, Flyers goalie Steve Mason made the lead stand. Derek Stepan, the Rangers' second shooter, scored to keep his team alive, but after Lundqvist denied Wayne Simmonds to start the third round, Mason made a left pad save on Dominic Moore to win it for the Flyers. \n\"When (Giroux) goes out there and gives you a two-goal lead in that situation, that's a must win for the goaltender,\" Mason said. \nMason's been a very solid No. 1 goalie since joining the Flyers in an April 2013 trade, but he fit right in with everyone else regularly stinking it up in shootouts. \nGiroux's shootout goal was a long time coming. His hands are as good as anyone's in the league, yet he was just 1-for-12 in shootouts last season after being good in them earlier in his career. \nGagner, who scored 20 shootout goals in 62 shots in past seasons, gives the Flyers another very skilled shooter. \n\"I played with Sammy in juniors and he had this patented move that was almost a guaranteed goal every time,\" Mason said. \"So to see him go down there with some pretty slick hands ...\" \nGagner didn't use his \"patented move\" to beat Lundqvist. \n\"I normally go forehand,\" he said. \nGagner tried it on his 3-on-3 overtime breakaway, but the puck slipped off his stick as he was moving it to his forehand side and he never got a shot off. \nPicked by coach Dave Hakstol to start the shootout — the Flyers opted to shoot first — Gagner decided to \"switch it up.\" and his backhander beat Lundqvist. \n\"The shootout's a different animal,\" Gagner said. \"Sometimes they go in, sometimes they don't. I'm confident in it.\" \nFor the time being, so are the Flyers, who feel good about not squandering the extra point like they did so times in the past. \n\"You want to find ways to win the close games whether it's a shootout or overtime or a one-goal game,\" Gagner said. \"Obviously, that's good news for us going forward.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:15:58.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
