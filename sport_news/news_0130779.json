It’s what separates first place teams, like the Fort Lewis women’s soccer team, from the rest of the pack. Sunday’s 1-0 win at Colorado Christian (0-11-2, 0-8-1 Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference) was the Skyhawks’ seventh in a row. Each win has come by a one-goal margin of victory and each game-winning goal has come in the second half. Four of the seven game-winning goals have come in the final ten minutes or in extra time. In the 83rd minute of Sunday’s game, redshirt sophomore Haleigh Macomb’s first career goal was the difference maker. “We’re becoming a very deep team, and a lot of the girls have the chance to make an impact,” Fort Lewis head coach Jimmy Hall said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “This is a very versatile group of women, and we’re able to change up our style of play when we want and put some different people in there who make a difference in the outcome.” After a scoreless first half, Hall decided to change up the game plan to put added pressure on Colorado Christian’s back line. The Skyhawks (10-2-1, 8-1 RMAC) ended up outshooting the opponents 13-9, which hasn’t happened very often this season. Hall has emphasized the importance of keeping possession and creating high quality chances rather than taking reckless shots. Following many near misses, Macomb handled a failed clearing attempt by the defense, dribbled up the left side and ripped a shot that deflected off the post and into the net. “It was a perfect shot,” said Hall. “She went 10-15 yards unchallenged, made a quick touch to her left and let it go.” The goal capped off a three-game, week-long road trip in which the Skyhawks went a perfect 3-0 and secured their place at the top of the conference standings. Wednesday’s 1-0 win at Adams State, courtesy of Courtney Riley’s game-winner in the 58th minute, was followed by a win in Golden against Colorado Mines for the first time in program history. Sophomore Alicia Sanchez’s fourth game-winning goal of the season, in the 66th minute, did in the Orediggers. In the seven- game winning streak, Sanchez has three game winners, two in overtime. On the topic of school history, Sunday’s win was the fourth shutout for senior goalkeeper Caitlyn Espinosa in the last five games. Her school record for shutouts is at 29 and counting. “We had a tough series of games, five in nine days, and it’s just fantastic to see how the girls have taken on the challenges we’ve faced,” Hall said. “We just refuse to let up, and the girls have given a consistent effort and kept a good attitude throughout. I couldn’t have asked for anything more than they’ve given.” The Skyhawks will come home to a well-deserved week off. They’ll try to extend the winning streak to eight with at 12 p.m. Sunday at Dirks Field against Adams State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:26:51.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
