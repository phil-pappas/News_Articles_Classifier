A couple of blocked shots really make the job easier on the goaltender.” \nLazar was credited with two blocked shots in Sunday’s game against the Habs, both on the penalty kill and both off the stick of Jeff Petry. \nThe first, in the opening period, hurt him and left his status for Wednesday’s game in doubt. \n“Just a bruise. Long way from the heart,” Lazar shrugged at the morning skate while declaring himself good to go. “I do have the shot blockers on my feet, but of course there’s the two inches that are not covered on my foot and that’s right where I got it. \n“It’s pretty tough to skate when your foot hardly fits in it,” he added of missing Tuesday’s practice. “I guess 20 years old and the first week of the season having a maintenance day is not the best thing, but the extra day off rest really helped.” \nThe second, in the middle period, sent him down ice on a breakaway, but he was caught before he could get a clean shot away. \n“People are getting on me for being too slow, but I’d like them try blocking a couple of shots and try hobbling down the ice,” Lazar said, laughing. \nWhen Erik Condra moved to Tampa Bay as a free agent over the summer, the Senators lost a strong penalty killer who would throw himself in front of slappers. Lazar wants to fill that void. \n“Whenever you see guys do it, you always try to get tips here and there on how to block them and stuff,” he said. “The main thing is to get in the lane. You’ve seen some unorthodox shot blocking techniques in the past.. for me, whatever it takes.” \nThe only roster change the Senators will make for the game at the Nationwide Arena is in goal, with Craig Anderson making his third start of the season. \nJudging by the practice, Ottawa will stick with the same line combinations: - Mike Hoffman - Kyle Turris - Mark Stone - Clarke MacArthur - Mika Zibanejad - Bobby Ryan - Milan Michalek - Jean-Gabriel Pageau - Lazar - Alex Chiasson - Zack Smith - Chris Neil. \nThe defensive pairings will also remain the same: - Marc Methot - Erik Karlsson - Patrick Wiercioch - Cody Ceci - Jared Cowen - Mark Borowiecki \nWith three losses in their first three games, the Blue Jackets shuffled their line combinations Wednesday morning. \nRyan Johansen was between Boone Jenner and Brandon Saad; William Karlsson was in the middle of Nick Foligno and Scott Hartnell; Brandon Dubinsky centred Matt Calvert and Cam Atkinson; and Gregory Campbell was between Rene Bourque and Jared Boll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:54:52.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
