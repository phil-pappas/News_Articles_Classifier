Rather, he wants to put players in positions where they can glitter, even if it's only for a few plays. \nIn the last three record-setting passing games for Josh McCown, the Browns have thrown to 8, 8, and 9 receivers, respectively. \nDeFilippo believes the NFL is a matchup league. If a team has a large cornerback whose best assets are his strength and size rather than speed, is there a way to force him to cover a smaller, quicker receiver, such as Andrew Hawkins or Taylor Gabriel? \nCan they force a bulky linebacker to try and defend Duke Johnson when the speedy rookie running back lines up as a wide receiver? \nDeFilippo talked about being a \"briefcase coach\" and leaving the office at \"5 o'clock.\" He meant being married to a certain system on offense. He said it's the coaches job to have \"the right plays and the right guys running those plays.\" \nHe also has given McCown the freedom to switch from a pass to a running play ... or the run to a pass ... in several situations during the game. \nTravis Benjamin is emerging as a deep-threat receiver. He has caught 22 passes for an 18.7 average and four touchdowns. Before this season, the most receptions that Benjamin ever had in a year was 18. \nGary Barnidge leads the Browns with 24 catches, the most in his seven-year NFL career. He has caught three touchdown passes, and DeFilippo has had a knack of calling plays where the tight end is wide open. \nA member of the Baltimore front office mentioned how the Browns do a good job throwing the football to their small, speedy receivers in spots where they can use their quickness to pick up yards after the catch. He was talking about Andrew Hawkins and Taylor Gabriel, both in the 5-foot-7 range. \nDeFilippo stills want to establish a running game, but defenses have been stacking the line of scrimmage against the Browns. That has led to short passes to running backs Isaiah Crowell and Johnson. \nIn the first five games of the season, the Browns have only dropped eight passes. Brian Hartline, Jim Dray and Barnidge each have two. Benjamin has not dropped a pass this season. His excellent hands make him even more dangerous as a receiver. \nBrowns General Manager Ray Farmer has stressed that good scouting can uncover receivers who aren't at the top of the draft. Often, they just need an opportunity to prove they can be effective. \nThe season is only five games old and a lot can change. But so far, the combination of DeFilippo, McCown and the variety of receivers has led to the Browns being the sixth-ranked passing team in the NFL. \nABOUT SAMMY WATKINS \nHad the Browns kept the No. 4 pick in the 2014 draft and selected Sammy Watkins, I would have praised the move. \nWatkins had a solid rookie year with Buffalo, 65 catches for a 15.1 average. He caught six touchdown passes and had only four drops. \nBut this season has been a mess for Watkins. He had some minor injuries in training camp. He caught seven passes in the first two games, 14.1 average. \nSince then, he has been out with a calf injury. While injured, Watkins complained to the Buffalo News that he wasn't being targeted with enough passes. He wants to be thrown at least 10 passes a game. \n\"You're making me look bad and you're making yourself look bad,\" Watkins told reporter Tyler Dunne . \"Why not make both of us look good?\" \nThe Browns look bad because they used the deal for Watkins to add two first round picks -- Justin Gilbert and Cameron Erving. Perhaps one of them will deliver in the future, but both are on the bench right now. \nManziel is the backup to Josh McCown. Gilbert is playing a lot on special teams. He didn't play a single snap at cornerback in the 33-30 overtime victory in Baltimore. \nThe Bills are 3-2. Watkins is hurt. His outburst makes little sense at this point, other than he's frustrated. \nif the Browns had to do it over at No. 4, they probably should have taken linebacker Khalil Mack. He was the No. 5 pick in that draft. He has three sacks in five games with Oakland and appears to have a Pro Bowl future. \nABOUT JOHNNY MANZIEL \nNot all the details about what happened between Johnny Manziel and his girlfriend when they were detained by police earlier in the week have been made public. No one was charged with a crime, but police said they both had been drinking. \nThat's a major problem for Manziel, who spent 11 weeks in a rehabilitation center earlier in the year. \nThe Browns quarterback has never discussed why he went into rehab, but his actions last season in various nightclubs indicated an obvious problem with alcohol. There were too many embarrassing pictures of him being intoxicated. \nGM Ray Farmer issued a statement saying, \"It is a matter that we take seriously and have expressed our concerns to Johnny.\" \nThey should. \nWhen you spend 11 weeks in rehab, the goal is a sober lifestyle. That means staying away from people and places where drinking is the norm. Now, it's up to Manziel to use this as a warning and be serious about changing parts of his life or bigger trouble looms. \nThe question for Manziel is this, \"Do you really want to change your life?\" \nIf not, there will only be more pain. \nIn the meantime, he once again hurt the Browns and all his fans who have stood by him. \nThis also explains why the Browns signed Austin Davis to a three-year deal. They want more protection at quarterback in case Manziel has more trouble. \nABOUT THE BROWNS \n1. DeFilippo has said he wants to have Brian Hartline on the field more and a bigger part of the offense. The veteran receiver played 52 percent of the snaps against Baltimore. In the last two games, he has caught only two total passes. The ball was thrown to him four times. Hartline has nine catches on the season. \n2. I don't know why defensive coordinator Jim O'Neil keeps talking about Barkevious Mingo being a \"big part of the game plan,\" when he's hardly been playing linebacker. The defensive coordinator may have had bigger plans for Mingo, but he was on the field for four snaps in Baltimore. In the last three games, his snap totals have been dropping, from 23 to 18 to 4. The Browns prefer rookie Nate Orchard and Armonty Bryant ahead of Mingo. They don't say that, but the recent snap counts scream it. \n3. With Scott Solomon injured and out for the season, Orchard has a tremendous chance to prove he can make an impact. He was a second-round pick from Utah. Orchard had a rough preseason as he missed several weeks with back problems. His snap count has been increasing from 13-20-25-43. He is supposed to be a pass rusher, and now he needs to record his first sack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:10:37.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
