GLENN GUILBEAU, Gannett Louisiana 8:39 p.m. CDT October 7, 2015 LSU's game Saturday against South Carolina has been moved to Baton Rouge due to flooding. (Photo: Gannett file photo) \nBATON ROUGE — Lagniappe game! \nLSU will become the first Southeastern Conference school since the 1970s to play more SEC home games than any other league school as its scheduled game at South Carolina on Saturday was moved on Wednesday to LSU on Saturday because of historic flooding in the Columbia, South Carolina, area. \nKickoff is at 2:30 p.m. in Tiger Stadium. Television coverage information was not known as of Wednesday afternoon. \n“We have decided to move the game to Baton Rouge,” South Carolina president Harris Pastides said in a release Wednesday morning. “The stress on law enforcement and first responders is too great (to host the game at South Carolina). Moreover, we’ve had many in the Carolina family directly impacted by the flooding.” \nNo. 5 LSU (4-0, 2-0 SEC) will now have five SEC home games and three on the road. South Carolina (2-3, 0-3 SEC) will have just three home games and five on the road. The Gamecocks’ only remaining home league games will be against Vanderbilt on Oct. 17 and against Florida on Nov. 14. The other 12 SEC teams have four league games at home and four on the road. \n“It’s an advantage,” said Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze, whose 14th ranked team (4-1, 2-1 SEC) will host LSU on Nov. 21 in a game that could decide the SEC West race. \n“Of course, it’s an advantage for them to play five home games in the league,” Freeze said. “But when times of tragedy strike, you pitch in and you do what’s necessary to help through those times. And I think this is an example of that. I hate it for the South Carolina people, but any time tragedy hits, I know these coaches and I know the SEC office are going to do what’s best for the people.” \nIt will not be a typical home game for LSU, however, at least from a financial standpoint. South Carolina will keep ticket and concession money while reimbursing LSU’s expenses to stage the game on short notice, according to an LSU release. LSU usually makes more than $3 million on a typical home football game. Because of the unique setup with South Carolina keeping a lot of gate money, the next LSU-South Carolina game scheduled for Tiger Stadium in 2020 will remain in Tiger Stadium. \nLSU will also try to truly “host” the game more than usual. LSU’s band, for example, plans on playing South Carolina’s fight song for the Gamecocks fans who find their way to the game as the South Carolina band will not be making the trip. Other hospitality related ideas are in the works. \nThe American Red Cross will be collecting donations for flood victims in South Carolina at the entry gates to Tiger Stadium. \nSouth Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner thanked LSU President F. King Alexander and athletic director Joe Alleva for their “cooperation” and “flexibility” in assisting the game site switch. \n“Changing venues on such short notice is no easy task,” Tanner said. “On behalf of the South Carolina athletic department, our thoughts and prayers are with those who have suffered the loss of life and property during this tragic flood.” \nTanner and Pastides considered sites near Columbia such as Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta; and Jacksonville, Florida, but none worked out. \n“We look forward to the challenge and competing against the Tigers in Baton Rouge on Saturday,” South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier said. “We want to do the right thing and do what is best for all concerned. It appears the best thing is to travel to LSU.” \nSpurrier has lost his last two games in Tiger Stadium as South Carolina’s coach — 23-21 in 2012 and 28-16 in 2007. LSU was a 13-point favorite to beat South Carolina before the venue change. That betting line is expected to rise five or six points because of the move. \n“We recognize and are very sympathetic that this is a very difficult time,” LSU coach Les Miles said on the SEC teleconference Wednesday morning shortly before the game was moved. “We want to support South Carolina in anything they want to do. We’ve been through weather issues here, and no one is above it.” \nLSU canceled its scheduled season opener against McNeese State on Sept. 5 due to weather. Miles’ first LSU team had to move its scheduled home game on Sept. 10, 2005, from Tiger Stadium to Tempe, Arizona, because the LSU campus was being used as the primary relief center for Hurricane Katrina, which had hit on August 29. \n“We’re hoping for their community and the entire state of South Carolina to get through this damage from the flood waters and what was the loss of life,” Miles said.
