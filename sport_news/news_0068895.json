The opportunity is increasing and CTL is giving them a chance to see these players in the world's top 25,\" said Amritraj, a winner of 16 singles titles.\n\"They get opportunities at finding out what they do, how they practise, their diet, their gym work and all of that. They have the opportunity to watch everything from close up and get inspired.\"\nAmritraj said with more lower-tier tournaments held in the country, players don't have to fret over breaking into the world rankings anymore.\n\"I think there's no estimate to what the opportunities are. There's lot more television coverage, lot more sponsorship available, there's lot more tournaments,\" the 61-year-old, now a well-known television pundit, said.\n\"If players are playing enough matches and enough tournaments in India, there are enough ATP and WTA points available that can put you in the top 300 without having to leave the country.\n\"They had to go to Europe and face some tough situations and tough weather conditions and compete away from home.\n\"So this is less expensive and more opportunity. Having said that, there is also even more competition.\"\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:12:13.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
