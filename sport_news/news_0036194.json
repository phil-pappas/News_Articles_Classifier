This was stated by AICET Chairman Dr Anil D Sahasrabudhe, who was in the city for the fifth PEC convocation. “Under the Marg Darshan Scheme of the AICET, the institutes that guide other institutes to become autonomous get funding for it,” he said. Sharing a proposal of the AICET, Dr Anil said they are planning to make educational institutes autonomous. With this the educational institutes can set their own syllabus and curriculum rather than following the curriculum set by a university as each area has its own industrial demand for which modified courses are required. He said the AICET was encouraging colleges to opt for the autonomous status so that these could frame their own curriculum as per needs of the local industry. He further said at present there were 250 colleges with the autonomous status. “As per plan, 100 colleges will be given autonomous status out of 3,000 engineering colleges affiliated to the AICET in the first phase as it has been observed that colleges usually take longer time to revise courses as per the requirement of the industry, affecting placement of students. Meanwhile, PEC Director Prof Manoj K Arora said soon the institute would take up the proposal of upgrading the PEC to an IIT with the Human Resource Development Ministry. The proposal was submitted a year ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:16:17.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
