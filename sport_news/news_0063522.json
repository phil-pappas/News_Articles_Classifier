We are now working on more combination plays on offense, improvement of our reception and net defense as well as communication inside the court in preparation for the Grand Prix.”\nOut to provide stability for Cignal are former University of Arkansas middle blocker Amanda Anderson and hitter Ariel Usher.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:47:05.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
