Those born in Mumbai and wishing to return to the fold have been set a one-year cooling period to be back in contention for selection.\n“There was some confusion over the cooling period rules. The selectors first picked Ranjane for the Shalini Bhalekar tournament. The issue was raised in the last Managing Committee meeting and the concerned player was removed from the Mumbai U-23 squad after getting clarity on the rule,” said a source.\nA few days later, Vazge received a threat call from a number that was traced to Pune. Vazge informed the MCA and lodged an FIR at the Shivaji Park police station.\n“I am very upset at what has happened. I acted within the parameters of the rule book. I have written to the MCA and to all my colleagues in the Managing Committee. It’s up to them (MCA) now,” Vazge told mid-day yesterday.\nMCA’s Joint Honorary Secretary Dr Unmesh Khanvilkar said the Managing Committee will take up the issue. “This is a serious issue. The Managing Committee will decide on the further course of action,” said Khanvilkar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:12:48.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
