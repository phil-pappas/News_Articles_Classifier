A few weeks ago, Brandon saw that The Longhorn Network was hosting a contest to be inducted into the Longhorn Nation Hall of Fame. Audrey says she was reluctant at first because she didn't want to get Brandon's hopes up. \nThe family submitted pictures of themselves and a message explaining their love for The Longhorns. Just a few days later, they learned they were one of three finalist to win the contest. \n\"It's hard to be this big of a fan here in Amarillo because we are so far away from Austin,\" said Anthony Puente. \"Of course, we have Lubbock so close and everyone is a Tech fan, but this has been fun, exciting and it's brought our family closer together.\" \nIf the Puente family wins they will receive a VIP game day experience and recognition on November 7th's game, a $1,500 gift certificate from the Texas Boot Company, and their picture hung at DKR Stadium. \nWith hundreds who have entered the contest, The Puente family says they're happy to have made it to the final three, but the thought of winning would be a moment to remember. \n\"I could possibly shed a tear because it would be so much of a great honor,\" said Brandon Puente. \nVoting for the contest ends Sunday night at midnight. To vote for the Puente Family to win go to the Longhorn National Hall of Fame 's website.
