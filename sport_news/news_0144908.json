When I walk into that gym, their energy gives me the energy I need.\"\nKaiser opted to continue coaching this season after her initial diagnosis. Doctors believed she had early-stage cancer and treatment simply meant surgery to remove a tumor. But surgery revealed a cancer more aggressive than expected.\n\"I planned everything around volleyball when they first said it was going to be simple,\" Kaiser said. \"When I got the news it was a little bigger than they thought, it was tough.\"\nLake Worth Christian volleyball coach Terri Kaiser is in her usual spot on the sidelines this season, even as she battles breast cancer -- a disease that killed one of her sisters in 2010 and also currently affects her mother and another sister.\nSo this season, her 29 t h as a volleyball coach, nothing's simple. But the bad news has been challenged by the good.\nSaturday's tournament finals victory, hosted by Lake Worth Christian (14-3, 2-0), raised Kaiser's career-win total to 598 matches.\nAnd with a victory against Wellington on Monday, Kaiser could earn her 600th career win Tuesday, when the Defenders take on Trinity Christian.\nTuesday also will mark another team achievement: the seventh-anniversary kickoff for Lake Worth Christian's annual Volley For A Cause.\nThe tournament was first held in 2008, when Kaiser's youngest sister, Connie VanderWey, learned she had breast cancer — the first in the family to receive the diagnosis.\nThough in remission for a time, VanderWey's cancer later worsened and she died in 2010. In the interim, another of Kaiser's sisters, Jane Holloway, was diagnosed with breast cancer. The women's mother, Audrey VanderGriend, later began treatment as the third family member with the disease. Currently Holloway's and VanderGriend's cancer is in remission.\nThis year, Kaiser's volleyball team has raised more than $10,000. The players said the funds will be donated to help cover their coach's medical bills.\n\"She doesn't like being in the spotlight,\" Emily Lampman said of her coach. \"We told her, 'It's our turn to do something for you.'\"\nThe Lake Worth Christian senior earned All-County first-team honors last season. A fifth-year starter, Lampman has played on two of Kaiser's state championship teams, in 2011 and 2012.\nKaiser's daughter, Joy VanDyke, an assistant coach under Kaiser for the past decade, said hosting Volley for a Cause has meant a lot to her from the beginning \"because it was for my aunt.\" VanDyke played college ball at Palm Beach Atlantic in the early 2000's, during his mother's nine-year tenure there as coach.\n\"I went through the process with both of my aunts,\" VanDyke said. \"But you just never know what it fully feels like until it's your mom.\"\nKaiser, who faces months of further treatment before her next medical evaluation, doesn't want her cancer to be what's motivating her team. A two-year state title drought, she says, should be all the inspiration her Defenders need to get to this season's final match at the University of Central Florida.\n\"I don't want them to play for me,\" Kaiser said. \"But I did tell them 'If I'm pushing to be here at every practice with as much energy as I can muster, you need to mirror it.\"\nblevine@tribpub.com / @Bryan_Levine\n Cancer Breast Cancer", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56099789/turbine/k5", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5609f1b4/turbine/fl-lake-worth-christian-coach-cancer-0921-jpg-20150928", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56098ed8/turbine/fl-lake-worth-christian-coach-cancer-0929-20150928", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5609976a/turbine/sfl-lake-worth-christian-volleyball-coach-terri-kaiser-20150928"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:42:44.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
