This invention enables a user to walk more safely on icy surfaces. This will help to avoid slips, falls and injuries, which promotes safety and peace of mind. It's also ideal for people who work around[in] other slippery environments [kitchens].\nThe original design was submitted to the Sacramento office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
