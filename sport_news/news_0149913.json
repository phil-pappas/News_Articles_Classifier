Saturday however, Howard threw three interceptions and lost two fumbles. His task became more difficult as the deficit grew in the waning moments of the game when WVU was forced to go to the air with regularity. Oklahoma scored seventeen unanswered points to close out the game. But prior to pulling away late in the third and early in the fourth quarter, WVU crept within three points at 27-24. Perhaps if faced with a similar deficit against their September opponents, West Virginia would have been able to escape with a good result. But in Big 12 play, against four consecutive ranked opponents, the margins for error narrow significantly. West Virginia's four October opponents all have a 'zero' in the loss column. The gauntlet gets no easier with Oklahoma State this Saturday in the only home game for WVU prior to November 7th.
