(Photo: Wendy Bellino/For The Town Talk) \nDespite a tough overtime loss in its Week 7 district matchup with Ouachita, there is optimism at Alexandria Senior High. \n\"It's a new day!\" Trojans assistant Thomas Bachman exclaims during a recent practice. \nASH comes in into its Week 8 matchup with Ruston needing a win to keep pace with West Monroe in the District 2-5A standings. However, the Bearcats are also in a similar situation with both teams tied a game behind with 1-1 records. \n\"Basically, we're playing for the conference championship,\" Trojans coach Sam Goodwin said. \"If we don't win this one, it's no chance that West Monroe will lose two games. You just hope that you can cause them to lose one. We're both in the same boat. I think whoever loses can probably wipe it off.\" \nThe Bearcats' lone district loss came against the Rebels in Week 6, where they lost 28-14 in a tough matchup. Yet, they rebounded with a 49-0 shutout of Pineville as they held it to 60 yards of offense. \n\"We know Ruston's probably the best defensive team in the league against the run,\" Goodwin said. \"Hopefully the fact that we can throw the ball will give them some problems.\" \nThe Trojans definitely have a weapon in senior quarterback Matthew Beck that can stretch out the defense. Beck leads the state with 1,822 passing yards and 27 touchdowns, while junior receiver Suede Taylor has 45 receptions for 712 yards and four touchdowns. \nHowever, ASH's biggest challenge will be stopping the run, after allowing 481 yards on the ground — 255 to Devion Warren and 195 to Gabe Lewis — against Ouachita. \n\"We're just trying to get where we can tackle a little better and get better angles on pursuit,\" Goodwin said. \"We've gone up against some good running backs and quarterbacks that can run. (Warren) was phenomenal and if we get against somebody like that, we just have a hard time once they break the line of scrimmage. We can give them a few bad plays, but once they get past the line of scrimmage, it's like we can't do much with them.\" \nSenior defensive lineman/linebacker Kolby Parker will have to help the Trojans stop the running back duo of Ruston seniors Qay'shon Thurman and Sontus Miller. Parker, who has 60 tackles and leads the Trojan defense with three sacks, mentions that it all starts with preparation. \n\"Basically, we gameplan as much as we can,\" Parker said. \"We just try to do everything that we can. We mix a lot of fronts and coverages to maintain the run game.\" \nAfter two games, ASH has shown that it can compete with Class 5A competition and will hope to continue that trend at Trojan Stadium Friday. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. \nFRIDAY'S PREP FOOTBALL GAMES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:33:39.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
