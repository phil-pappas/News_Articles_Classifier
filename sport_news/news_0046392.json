Sources said during the inspection of the 22.71-km-long double track, the Chief Commissioner also evaluated the signal system. Kardam, along with officials from Ambala Division, inspected the Ambala-Dappar section double lane. In the train, comprising four coaches, which was used for the inspection, the last coach had glass on the rear side to enable a full view of the track. It also had an LED, which was connected to the speed limit system of the locomotive. During the inspection, the Chief Commissioner instructed the officials concerned to increase the speed limit to 110 km per hour on the stretch to monitor the output. A team had inspected the full section from Ambala to Dappar using a push trolley on Sunday. Meanwhile, due to the inspection, various trains had to be cancelled or diverted, causing inconvenience to passengers. The enquiry counter at the city railway station was flooded with calls regarding the rescheduling of trains. Work on the Dappar-Chandigarh double track, a stretch of 22.45 km, will be taken up by the Railways after this project is completed at a cost of Rs 338.54 crore. The work on this stretch will be completed by December 2016.
