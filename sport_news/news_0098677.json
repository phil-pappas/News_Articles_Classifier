There’s no dating. We’re together.” \nBrowne said the two got involved over the summer, but repeatedly insisted the two are not “dating” because “dating is for children.” \n“I’ve gotten to know her through the gym, through all that kind of stuff,” he said (via Fox Sport s), describer her as “compassionate” and “sweet.” \n“I see her for who she is,” he added. \nThe revelation does not come as much of a surprise. Rumors of the pair’s involvement have been churning since August , but Browne’s past had many questioning the judgement of the 28-year-old women’s bantamweight champion. \n[ Ronda Rousey’s next opponent? Hollywood’s body shamers ] \nIn August, the UFC was wrapping up an investigation into allegations that Browne, 33, abused his estranged ex Jenna Renee Webb, who was the first to out the couple on Twitter. She also questioned Rousey’s judgement in getting involved with her ex at the time. \n“I expected more from her,” Webb continued on Twitter at the time. “Honestly, it’s only a matter of time that she sees his true colors.” \nThe UFC investigation ultimately cleared Browne, who was never arrested, of domestic assault allegations and the promotion reinstated the fighter, who had been temporarily suspended for the length of the two-month probe. He is currently readying to meet Matt Mitrione in the Octagon at UFC Fight Night 81 on Jan. 17. \n[ Ronda Rousey promise ‘much longer’ fight against Holly Holm ] \nRousey, meanwhile, has not confirmed any type of relationship with Browne. She is currently training to meet her next challenger, Holly Holm, in the Octagon at UFC 193 on Nov. 14.
