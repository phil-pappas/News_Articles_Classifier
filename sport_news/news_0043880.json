One duly arrived on 27 minutes as Wolves failed to clear deep in their own half, leaving Johnson to send a cross to the far post for Martin to head in his second.A frantic end to the first half came in stoppage time, with Martin first denied from the penalty spot by Martinez, after Danny Batth brought down Ince, before the resultant corner was bundled home somewhat inadvertently by Johnson at the far post.Derby were clearly eager to extend that lead quickly after the interval, as Russell's darting runs caused much trouble for Wolves, who then saw the number 11 poke home a half-clearance on 56 minutes, after some great footwork from Jeff Hendrick.Wolves, as in the first half, responded with a goal, but not before Jackett made a double change with Jack Price making way for Conor Coady and Wallace replaced by Sheyi Ojo. It was the latter who helped reduce the deficit, as he headed down for Le Fondre, the Cardiff loanee finishing well on the turn.Nevertheless, the hosts appeared largely in control as Russell continued to haunt the Wolves backline.The visitors did have a chance to pull one back with three minutes left, with Henry given a free-kick from within range on the left, though the effort was blazed over, summing up Wolves' day out at Pride Park.
