Sometimes they don’t.\nFarmington Hills Harrison and crosstown host Farmington came into Friday’s Oakland Activities White Division game each averaging four touchdowns and four extra points a game. The difference was defense, with the Falcons allowing more than 22 points per game while Harrison was at a leaner 12.8 points, including two shut outs.\nHarrison’s defense and special teams beat its average but the offense didn’t in a 13-12 squeaker over host Farmington, keeping the Hawks undefeated in the league at 5-0 and earning a playoff berth.\n“Farmington played with great intensity,” said Harrison coach John Herrington. “They made it tough on us. We couldn’t really run the ball on them, and it was just a tough game that could have gone either way. And unbelievable it’s decided by a couple missed extra points.”\nDefense and ball-control defined the game, as each team scored only once per half.\nHarrison came out on fire and scored on a 10-play opening drive, capped by Guam Lee Jr.’s 10-yard pass from quarterback Anthony Giovanni. However, the Hawks were held to only seven plays from scrimmage the rest of the half as Farmington hogged the ball.\nFarmington began with two good drives but both ended in Harrison territory — on an interception by Jamison Scarber and an incomplete pass on fourth down. Yet Farmington tied the game on its third try, an 11-play, 87-yard drive on a two-yard run by Kyle Brunson.\nOn the ensuing kickoff, Farmington’s Zhyaire Brown recovered a fumble to give the Falcons another offensive opportunity, but the drive stalled in the Harrison red zone in the closing seconds of the second quarter.\nHarrison took the lead late in the third quarter when Giovanni rolled right and found Kordell Agee along the sideline. Agee caught the ball, tip-toeing the white stripe to stay in bounds near the five yard line, then turned to score. Alex Bolstrum’s extra-point kick eventually was the difference. The drive was aided by a roughing-the-punter call and a successful fourth and two play at Farmington’s 39.\n“On both TDs the line gave great protection; they allowed me to roll out and find the open man, and luckily they went for touchdowns,” Giovanni said.\nOn the next possession, Farmington had a fourth and 24 at the Harrison 25 yard line, when JDrew McGovern made the touchdown pass to Daylen Baldwin, just before the wide right kick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:31:06.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
