JOEY VOTTO WILL BRING YOU UP TODAY AND ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. ONE OF THEM IS TICKETING AND PARKING. WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OUR SENIORS ASSOCIATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR -- DIRECTOR WILL GIVE YOU LOGISTICS AND WHAT IT TAKES TO TURN AROUND AGAIN. I WILL BRING JOE UP, HE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AND THEN WE WILL GO TO BRIAN AND EDDIE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. FIRST I'M SORRY WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER LIKE THIS, BECAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH ALL THE FAMILIES AND FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND WE WISH THEM ALL A SPEEDY RECOVERY. AND GOOD GRACES. WE ARE ON A TO BE ABLE TO HELP OUT SOUTH CAROLINA AND PLAY THE GAME HERE. IN THIS BUSINESS, TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS AND LONG-TERM BUDDIES ARE THERE. TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM OUT IS AN HONOR AND I'M GLAD WE ARE ABLE TO DO IT. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE, THE WAY WE HANDLE THE GAME IN TIGER STADIUM WON'T BE PERFECT. IT PROBABLY WON'T BE AS GOOD AS A NORMAL GAME AS FAR AS HAVING A FULL STAFF OF PEOPLE TO DO CONCESSIONS AND STAFFING WE NORMALLY DO. I DO WANT TO THANK THE POLICE HERE IN -- AND THIS SHERIFF IN BATON ROUGE. THEY HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC IN REORGANIZING PLANS AND SCHEDULED TO HELP US OUT FOR THE GAME. KUDOS GO OUT TO THE POLICE AND SHERIFFS DEPARTMENTS. ALL OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THIS, BUT ALL OF THE REVENUE FROM THIS GAME, ALL THE TICKET SALES , MINUS EXPENSES, WILL GO TO SOUTH CAROLINA. THEY ARE BASICALLY THE HOME TEAM FOR THIS GAME. THE RED CROSS WILL BE HERE TO ACCEPT MONETARY DONATIONS FOR THE FLOOD RELIEF IN SOUTH CAROLINA. BECAUSE OF THE SHORT TURNAROUND AND GETTING READY FOR THE GAME, WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW FANS TO BRING A BOTTLE OF WATER IN WITH THEM TO THE GAME. ONE BOTTLE PER FAN OF WATER. THAT IS BECAUSE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO HANDLE THE CONCESSION STANDS. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE VERY WARM, 88 OR 90 DEGREES ON SATURDAY. 2:30 KICKOFF, IT WILL BE WARM. WE ENCOURAGE FANS TO STAY HYDRATED AND BRING A BOTTLE OF WATER. PARKING FOR THIS GAME, WE WILL ALLOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE PARKING PASSES TO USE THEIR WESTERN PARKING PASS FOR SATURDAY'S GAME. THE WESTERN KENTUCKY PARKING PASS WILL WORK FOR THIS GAME. WE ENCOURAGE FANS TO KEEP THE PARKING PASS, BECAUSE IT WILL WORK AGAIN FOR THE WESTERN KENTUCKY GAME. DON'T THROW A LAYER PARKING PASS, KEEP IT FOR THE WESTERN KENTUCKY GAME. -- DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR PARKING PASS. KEEP IT FOR THE WESTERN KENTUCKY GAME. WE WERE ASKED ABOUT PAINTING THE FIELD SOUTH CAROLINA COLORS, EVEN THOUGH WE THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA, WE CANNOT DO THAT. WE HAVE A GAME NEXT WEEK. THE FIELD WILL BE THE SAME AS ALWAYS FOR AN LSU GAME. OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SOUTH CAROLINA FEEL AT HOME. WE WANT OUR FANS TO MAKE THEM FEEL AT HOME AND WE HOPE THE FANS COME OUT AND SUPPORT OF THE GAME, AND SUPPORT BOTH TEAMS. WE WILL TREAT SOUTH CAROLINA AS THE HOME TEAM FOR THE MOST PART, WE WILL PLAY THEIR MUSIC, PLAY THEIR FIGHT SONGS, PLAY THEIR ALMA MATER. THAT IS BASICALLY WHERE WE ARE. IF ANY OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND WE WILL GET A MIC OVER TO YOU. HI JOE, CAN YOU GIVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT PERCENTAGE OF A FULL AMOUNT OF STAFF THAT WILL BE? PROBABLY AROUND 75%. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ABILITY TO HANDLE EVERYTHING THAT IS A NORMAL GAME DAY OPERATION? WE FEEL CONFIDENT WE WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT/ . WE FEEL CONFIDENT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT. WILL THE STADIUM STILL HAVE FULL CAPACITY OR WILL THERE BE SECTIONS CLOSE? THAT WILL DEPEND ON TICKET SALES. AS OF RIGHT NOW WE PLAN ON SETTING DOWN THE EAST UPPER DECK AND SOUTH UPPER DECK. RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT PLANNING ON SELLING. IF WE HAVE A GREAT TURNOUT IN NEED TO OPEN AREAS UP, WE WILL DO THAT/ . WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING FAN WISE, EXPECTATIONS AS FAR AS AMOUNT OF PEOPLE? I HAVE NO IDEA. I HOPE THE FANS TURN OUT. THIS IS A LAGNIAPPE GAME FOR FANS. I HOPE THEY TURN OUT AND SUPPORT BOTH TEAMS. WE WILL SEE. THAT QUESTION BACK HERE. ARE YOU PLANNING ON GIVING MORE EXCEEDING TO SOUTH CAROLINA, OR WILL IT BE MORE FIRST COME FIRST SERVE? WE WILL TALK TO SOUTH CAROLINA AND IT NEEDS. WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER BUT WE WILL ACCOMMODATE THEM, MAYBE A THOUSAND, 1200. BECAUSE OF THE SHORT NATURE OF THE TURNAROUND, THEY DON'T ANTICIPATE BRINGING A LOT OF PEOPLE. LIKE BRIAN SAID, 1000-2000 PROBABLY BE THE MOST THEY WILL HAVE. YOU OBVIOUSLY LOST THE MCNEESE STATE GAME. IS A GREAT THING FOR EVERYONE THAT YOU CAN HELP SOUTH CAROLINA AND WILL YOU MAKE CONCESSION SALES ARE OTHER WAYS TO MAKE MONEY FOR YOURSELF? I DON'T THINK WE WILL MAKE MUCH MONEY ON THIS GAME AT ALL. ALL THE TICKET REVENUE WILL GO TO SOUTH CAROLINA. FRANKLY, AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WILL PROBABLY MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE FLOOD RELIEF FUND FOR THE ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT. I CAN'T HOW YOU WHAT THAT WILL BE YET, BUT I ANTICIPATE US MAKING SOME KIND OF CONTRIBUTION AT THE END OF THE DAY. I'M GOING TO BRING UP THE TICKET MANAGER AND LET HIM TALK ABOUT TICKETS. HE KNOWS A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO. JOE WILL HANG AROUND FOR A LITTLE MORE AFTER IN CASE YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. BUT NOW WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TICKET PRICES. CURRENTLY WE ARE OFFERING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GROUPS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE TICKETS CONCURRENTLY.
