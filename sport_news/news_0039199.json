The monumental arch sat atop the famed colonnaded streets of the ancient city, which linked the Roman Empire to Persia.\nAn opposition activist who uses the name Khaled al-Homsi posted on Twitter late yesterday that the militants destroyed the arch.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the group blew up the arch but left the colonnades in place.\nMilitants also recently blew up two famed First Century temples in Palmyra.
