And I am sure his work rubs off on Picamoles. \n\"He along with a number of players in their pack have the ability to carry and offload. \n\"We have to trust what we do without the ball and make sure that we are on top of our game when we are defending.\" \nToulon battering-ram Mathieu Bastareaud will start at outside centre, but there can be no doubt France will send him straight down Sexton's channel in the Pool D decider. \nWesley Fofana takes the 12 shirt, meaning he and Bastareaud will form a midfield combination for the 13th time. Only Damien Traille and Yannick Jauzion have combined more often in the centres for France, that duo dovetailing 15 times for Les Bleus. \nFrance team to play Ireland: S Spedding; N Nakaitaci, M Bastareaud, W Fofana, B Dulin; F Michalak, S Tillous-Borde; E Ben Arous, G Guirado, R Slimani, P Pape, Y Maestri, T Dusautoir (capt), D Chouly, L Picamoles. \nReplacements: B Kayser, V Debaty, N Mas, A Flanquart, B Le Roux, M Parra, R Tales, A Dumoulin.
