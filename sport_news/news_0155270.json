Masahiro Tanaka missed a month, but his damaged elbow held up. Michael Pineda also missed a month, but his troublesome shoulder didn't fall off. Sabathia needed a 15-day disabled list stint, but that may have been a blessing, as he returned refreshed and with a new brace for his balky right knee. Nathan Eovaldi's season is probably done — if he doesn't return as a reliever — but he as a revelation. \nAnd don't like you knew Carlos Beltran and Brian McCann would turn it around. The pair signed big-money deals to join the Yankees before the 2014 season and then underperformed, to the point many Yankees fans were calling for them to be traded. But McCann's defense improved big-time, and his bat packed plenty of clutch hits. And Beltran? After his dismal spring training and April, he's easily been the Yankees' most consistent hitter. \nYou probably predicted huge seasons from Mark Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez, too, right? Wrong. But there they were, Teixeira proving he's not washed up at age 35, bopping 31 homers before a leg fracture ended his year in August, and A-Rod, putting his performance-enhancing drug suspension, age (he's 40) and health (two major hip surgeries) behind him to anchor the Yankees' lineup. \nIf those Yankees — plus others — can prove wrong naysayers, why can't they keep it up? \nThey'll likely be favored in the Wild Card game, considering the odds are that they'll host it. And from there ... it will be all about surpassing expectations, which they've continually done. \nWhy can't the Yankees win the World Series?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:22:46.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
