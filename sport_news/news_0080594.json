That was a first, said Hof, who said eight to 10 signed the agreement 24 hours after Odom arrived. \"Thousands of celebrities have been at my brothels, and some have spent more money than that, and none of them have asked for that (from the full staff),\" Hof said. \"That's probably something he learned from the Kardashians and that whole L.A. scene,\" said Hof, who wasn't at the brothel when Odom made the demand. \"They're getting huge offers. One of the girls was offered $20,000 to talk,\" Hof said. The two girls Odom paid $37,500 each for the four-day stay found him unconscious on Tuesday in a brothel guest house. Odom, who played in the NBA for 13 seasons and was married to Khloe Kardashian for four years, was transported from the Pahrump area to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas by ambulance. He came out of a coma Friday. Hof said he would not confirm or deny that Odom had visited the Love Ranch before. Odom \"was in a great mood after he got here, then he got a call and wasn't happy. It was about the (Kardashian) TV show rerunning something he didn't like,\" Hof said.
