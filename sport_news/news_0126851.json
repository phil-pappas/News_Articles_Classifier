He's got all the physical check marks (speed, strength, anticipation), but there's a mental warfare that goes on when opposing offenses take the field. \nThe best defense is diversion and distraction. \n\"That's just who he is and he likes to try and get in the opponent's head,\" said Griz receiver Jamaal Jones, a frequent target of friendly barbs during practices. \"Other than just locking 'em down, he'll talk to 'em too. That's his game and he's gotten really good at it.\" \nHarris' talkative ways started early, growing up in Chino, California, an inland suburban Los Angeles city about midway between LA proper and San Bernardino. \nBut rather than becoming the class clown and acting out, Harris was instead more a class conversationalist. He walked a nice line between troublemaker for teachers and an outgoing pleasure to have in class. \n\"My mom raised me in the right way to learn that,\" said Harris, the middle child of mother Monique and father Michael Harris. \"She realized that very early in my life. I haven't gotten in too much trouble with my mouth since.\" \nFootball was another early starter for Harris and he picked up the game around age 7, following in the footsteps of his brother, Michael Harris II, who was 3 years his senior. \nIt wasn't so much cornerback back then, though. Harris craved the ball and the spotlight. Running back was his fix. \n\"I wanted the ball in my hands, wanted the touchdowns,\" he remembered. \"I wanted all the fame and all the glory.\" \nAnd there was plenty of recognition. He rushed for 1,100 yards and 14 scores as a senior at Chino Hills in 2010, earning all-league and All-California Interscholastic Federation recognition. \nThe 5-foot-10, 180-pounder drew scholarship offers from colleges around the western United States to play running back and slot receiver. Harris very well could have been a collegiate running back playing in Washington-Grizzly Stadium. \nJust not as a Grizzly. \nHe committed to Montana's Big Sky Conference foe Portland State as a running back. Yet the more he thought about it, the more contrition he felt. His initial commitment had been, admittedly, rushed. And the relationship Harris had built with Aric Williams, the former CBs coach at Montana under head men Robin Pflugrad and Mick Delaney, was awfully comforting. \nBefore national signing day in February 2011, Harris changed his decision. He'd be heading to the mountains of Montana, the snow and the defensive side of the ball for good. \n\"We had kind of a bond and I sat down with my parents and felt like Montana was a better program for me,\" Harris said. \"At first I thought I would never come to Montana and I would never be this far away from California. \n\"But defense, growing up and understanding football more and understanding my purpose more, I fell in love with defensive back. I love stopping guys. It was challenging.\" \nHarris appeared in 10 games as a redshirt freshman in 2012, starting two, and kicked off a long stretch as a staple of the defensive secondary. Harris started 13 games in each of the past two seasons and has reprised his role at field cornerback in five of six games in 2015. \nEven when he's not on the field, Harris is making an impact, said current Griz corners coach JB Hall Jr. \n\"The week he was out with that concussion deal, he was still involved as far as game planning,\" Hall said, \"getting the younger guys behind him ready and taking them under his wing. He does that week in, week out whether he's playing or not. That's a big part of what we ask him to do.\" \nHarris drew an all-Big Sky honorable mention last season after totaling 55 tackles and one interception, down a bit from three picks as a sophomore. The picks have been few for Montana's defense this fall — three total with just one among the DBs (safety Yamen Sanders) — but Harris still covets the chance to get the ball in his hands as much as he did during his running-back days. \n\"I need to get some more (interceptions),\" he chuckled. \"... (The defensive line), they're putting pressure on the quarterbacks and we're locking down and letting them get sacks. I always mess with Tyrone (Holmes, UM's senior pass-rushing defensive end), tell him this time get to the quarterback but don't sack him. Let him throw the ball. \n\"I've got to get some balls my way and get some opportunities.\" \nSenior strong safety Justin Whitted, a fellow Southern California native and UM classmate of Harris', called the cornerback the communicator of the defense. \n\"He always handles his business,\" Whitted said. \nThat gets easier to do over time, Harris added. The game slows down once you've been in it for years and years. Football is football, whether it's at the pee-wee parks in Chino or within boisterous Washington-Grizzly Stadium. \nAnd preparation may be the biggest contributor. \n\"He knows what our game plan is before we give it to him (each week),\" Hall said. \"He's very good at being a student of the game, knowing where he needs to be. He's always gonna study tape.\" \nThe behind-the-scenes aspects of football — film review and scheming, play calling and strategizing — might be Harris' favorite thing about the game. It's as true during video game rounds of NFL Madden on Xbox — \"He likes to talk smack, but when you're up two touchdowns he finally silences up,\" Whitted joked — as it is for live action Saturdays. \nThe passion may lead to the defender one day becoming Coach Harris, though that's a ways down the road. After graduating this winter with a double major in communications (fittingly) and sociology, Harris has two main targets in mind. \nFirst there's a chance for an extended football life — the goal of most college players — training for Montana's pro day in March and a shot at turning his football propensity into a career in the NFL. \nSecondly, perhaps after a year off from classes, there's law school, where Harris could thrive using his gab and charisma — his other unique set of skills.
