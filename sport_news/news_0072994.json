A person, normally a young adult, is recorded by a family member after getting their wisdom teeth removed. In this case, Erik's girlfriend caught the action on video, and the footage is priceless. \nFOX23 Sports has shown the \"Broken Arrow Jungle\" student section throughout the year on Fans in the Stands as the students show off one of their cheers. In the video above, you'll see the original cheer and then Smithe apparently thinking he's still at a football game after getting his teeth removed. \n\"I don't remember any of it!!! It was a very different but fun experience (at the time)... once the medication wore off it wasn't so fun,\" said Smithe. \nAs for watching the footage days later, Smithe was a good sport. \n\"I was dying laughing when I saw my videos but I am not surprised to find out that I am so ingrained with BA Pride that I support my school no matter what state of mind I am in! Go Tigers!!!\" \nAwesome.
