Penalty wipes out Texas turnover, sets up Horns' first score Time: 9:40 remaining in the first quarter.\nThe situation: For the first time in the game, Texas started a play in Oklahoma territory. On a second-and-5 from the Sooners' 46, the Longhorns dropped back for the first throw of the drive.\nThe play: Two plays after starting quarterback Jerrod Heard was helped off the field with an injury, receiver Marcus Johnson stepped back to pass. It was into double coverage, and Oklahoma's Zack Sanchez appeared to come down with an interception. However, Sanchez held receiver John Burt, nullifying the turnover and giving the Longhorns 10 yards.\n\"To be honest, I threw it up, and I told [Burt] I was just trying to give him a chance,\" Johnson said. \"When [Sanchez] picked it, I felt bad, but before they called the penalty, I knew, myself, I couldn't dwell on it whether it was on us or them.\"\nThat was the first time this season Sanchez (Keller Central) was flagged for a play, and it moved the ball to the Oklahoma 36. This time last season, the 5-11, 179-pound cornerback was returning an interception for a score.\nIt would take Texas just four plays to get it into the end zone from there. That set up Texas' first lead over Oklahoma since 3-0 with 8:04 remaining in the first quarter of last year's game.\n\"That was huge for us -- the momentum and morale for the team and us just carrying that out throughout the rest of the game,\" Johnson said. \"Coach told us it was going to be a swing of momentum, and they were going to make big plays and we were going to make plays, so we had to continue to be consistent.\"\n2. Longhorns recover fumble on kickoff, cash in with TD Time: 7:44 remaining in the first quarter.\nThe situation: Texas was forced to kick off deep in its territory because of an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the Longhorns' touchdown. Oklahoma's Alex Ross took the kickoff at the Oklahoma 8 and weaved through defenders before being brought down. He fumbled the ball and the Longhorns recovered.\nThe play: Missed extra points, field goals and shanked punts cost the Longhorns dearly in their first five games this season, but against Oklahoma, the special teams opted for takeaways over giveaways.\nLast year, Ross returned a kickoff 91 yards for Oklahoma's first touchdown. But this time around, the junior contributed to Texas' second straight scoring drive.\nRoss, who found a seam in the middle of the Longhorns' kickoff unit, was able to get the ball to the Oklahoma 36. As a defender carried him down to the grass, Kevin Vaccaro was able to jar the ball loose just before Ross' knee reached the ground.\nKirk Johnson scooped up Ross' first fumble of the year, and seven plays later, the Longhorns found themselves with a two-touchdown cushion.\n\"That was a very big play,\" Texas linebacker Malik Jefferson said. \"You know, there's always three phases of the game: offense, defense and special teams. And that was big for both of us, offense and defense, because they ended up scoring.\n\"I was ready to get back out there, but at the same time, it was a relief, because we got another chance to score ... and that was the most exciting part.\"\n3. Sooners connect on 50-yard pass play Time: 6:15 remaining in the third quarter.\nThe situation: Oklahoma struggled to gain any kind of offensive traction through two quarters, so on first-and-10 from the Sooners' 43, the team decided to go for the home run ball. The 50-yard completion was Oklahoma's longest play of the day.\nThe play: Coming out of the half, Oklahoma again found itself trailing Texas by 14 points following a 27-yard field goal by Nick Rose. Up to that point, Oklahoma's biggest play from scrimmage was a 17-yard completion by Baker Mayfield to Durron Neal earlier in the drive.\nTwo plays later, Sterling Shepard (5-10, 193 pounds) sped by Duke Thomas and hauled in the pass, which gave Oklahoma its best field position since the team kicked a field goal in the second quarter from the Longhorns' 4.\nShepard came into the game with 20 receptions for 321 yards and three touchdowns. His longest catch of the season went for 44 yards against Tulsa, when he went off for eight catches and 144 yards.\nLast year, playing against No. 12 UCLA, Thomas bit on a pump fake by Jerry Neuheisel and surrendered the game-winning, 33-yard touchdown to Jordan Payton.\n\"We did the same thing that we have been practicing and how we've been playing,\" Shepard said. \"They just did a great job covering us.\"\n4. Foreman rumbles for 81 yards Time: :10 remaining in the third quarter.\nThe situation: The Longhorns found themselves deep in their own territory after a two-yard loss by D'Onta Foreman. The running back redeemed himself by breaking a sprint draw play up the gut and completely shifting field position.\nThe play: Texas now sat in the shadow of its own end zone and was faced with a 2nd and 12 from the 9. Foreman barreled up the heart of the Sooners' defense, broke a tackle and was off to the races. He even outran his blocker, which is part of the reason Zack Sanchez was able to push him out of bounds at the Oklahoma 10.\nHis 81-yard sprint is tied for the 11th-longest in Longhorns' history and the first time the team had run 80-plus-yard run since exactly three years ago, when Daje Johnson broke off an 84-yard rush on Oct. 10, 2012.\nEarl Campbell has the longest run to not go for a touchdown in Texas history. He was deprived of a score after an 83 tuck and run against North Texas in 1976.\n\"I was just thinking go score, that's all I was thinking,\" Foreman said. \"My thing was, I wanted to win for the seniors. When I was in high school, [Oklahoma] didn't offer me. They offered my brother, so I know I had a lot of hostility towards them, but I wanted to just go out there and play good.\"\n5. Baker Mayfield improvises to keep OU drive alive\nTime: 9:45 remaining in the fourth quarter.\nThe situation: For the third time in the game, the Sooners found themselves facing a two-score deficit, and to compound the issue, Oklahoma picked up a minimal gain on first down and didn't gain a yard on second or third down.\nThe play: Texas' defensive line harassed Baker Mayfield the entirety of the game, putting constant pressure on the quarterback Saturday afternoon. Heading into the fourth quarter, the Longhorns had corralled the signal caller for four sacks, but on this play, Mayfield showed his elusiveness when the Sooners were desperate to move the chains.\nThe 6-2, 214-pound quarterback was flushed from the pocket and made a split-second decision to pull it down and head towards the left sideline. There he found plenty of running room and was able to keep the drive alive with his nine-yard run on 4th and 8.\nFour plays later, Oklahoma was only one touchdown away from tying the game. Samaje Perine found some daylight on second-and-goal from the 1 and with eight minutes remaining in the contest, the Sooners were once again in striking distance.\n\"What we had was there,\" Mayfield said. \"We just didn't execute well. So plays that we did string up and bust it loose, those were just basic plays. ... It was just they were doing the basic things that they needed to do, and we weren't doing that early on today.\"\nTwitter: @InstantRHIplay\n2015 AT&T Red River Showdown Texas 24, Oklahoma 17 Box score\nCowlishaw: Texas' upset of Oklahoma alters narrative for Longhorns coach Charlie Strong\n5 memorable moments from Texas' big win in the Red River Showdown\nPhotos: Charlie Strong gets lifted up by team, wears Golden Hat; Longhorns celebrate with fans\nPregame photos: Fans pose by Big Texas as Texas and Oklahoma prepare for Red River Showdown\nTwitter reaction to Texas' upset of Oklahoma: Kevin Durant says 'Sorry NOklahoma'\nAttendance decreases, fails to crack 92,000 for first time since Cotton Bowl capacity increased\nTexas coverage Carlton: Embarrassment at TCU left Texas 'ticked off,' ready for redemption\nHow Texas' D-line took advantage of OU senior lineman's repeated mistake to make life tough for Sooners' QB Mayfield\nFive Thoughts: How Texas pulled off upset of Oklahoma\nCharlie Strong wears Golden Hat, Texas players throw coach in air after upset of Oklahoma\nPhoto: Texas Longhorn fans turn Oklahoma Sooners fan's car into trash can\nTwitter goes right for Longhorns, rapper Lil B lifts curse\nTexas quotable: 'Today was our day'\nUT's Malik Jefferson on Bevo's absence: 'It was weird because that's tradition and everybody loves that guy'\nHorns' Foreman tops 100-yard mark again\nUT's Malik Jefferson posts first two career sacks\nUT's Swoopes finding niche on short-yardage plays\nCharlie Strong's message for Gov.
