And then when we came out second half we just wanted to put them away early and that's what happened.\" \nThe Crusaders wanted to keep plenty of players behind the ball and try to produce offense with quick counters. That's exactly what happened when Jordan Fields-Brown made a strong run with the ball down the left before sending it forward to Antonios Araviakis, who cut to the middle and scored from 14 yards with his left foot for a 1-0 advantage with 28:20 to play in the first half. \nThe Baltimore Sun takes Athletes of the Week nominations from Friday night until Sunday at 6 p.m. Please provide name, school, class, sport, position, team results and the athlete's accomplishments for the week, with statistics by game, and other supporting information.

(Katherine Dunn, Glenn Graham) \nThe Eagles quickly responded when Wax finished off a chance from the right side to tie the game less than two minutes later. Despite controlling play for most of the remainder of the half, the Eagles couldn't gain a lead until after intermission. \nIt was an impressive second-half performance from the visitors, who connected on passes up the field and finished off scoring chances. \nCentral defenders Michael DeShields and Cale Thorne made sure the ball stayed at the other end with smooth play. \n\"They're an extremely talented team,\" St. Paul's coach Majid Mirza said. \"They came out and scored two goals in 4 ½ minutes — that's what good teams will do to you if they keep pressuring you. After that, we tried to keep it together, but we kind of fell apart a little. We have a young group, they really worked really hard and they're going to learn from this.\" \nThe Crusaders came into the game in fourth place and will close out the regular season with four straight road games starting Wednesday at Loyola Blakefield.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:16:20.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
