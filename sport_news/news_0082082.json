Comment Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 1:08 PM Updated at 1:15 PM Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 1:08 PM Updated at 1:15 PM The American Baseball Coaches Association has honored Central Catholic High School head baseball coach Doug Miller. Miller, who last June guided the Crusaders to a state title, is set to receive the ABCA/Diamond High School Division III District 4 Coach of the Year. District 4 includes Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Miller will be honored at the 72nd ABCA annual convention, Jan. 7-10, 2016, in Nashville, Tennessee. The 2015 Central Catholic baseball team went 26-7 and won the Division III state championship. It was the Crusaders’ third championship since 2008 under Miller, who is among the state’s all-time most successful baseball coaches.
