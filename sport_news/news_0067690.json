Brett Gardner was right when he said it would be a while before the Yankees get past their feeble loss to the Astros on Tuesday night. Letting go won’t be easy: For all the tension that typically spices up a wild-card shootout, the Bombers looked dead the moment they took the field. Somehow, a winner-take-all contest, baseball’s equivalent of Russian roulette, turned out to be remarkably uneventful.\nThat’s why it’s hard for fans to acknowledge the Bombers’ undeniable progress in 2015. And we’re not talking about the fringe crazies, the ones who want to fire GM Brian Cashman, run Joe Girardi out of town, trade Jacoby Ellsbury and otherwise reduce the entire franchise to rubble. Even reasonable ticket-buyers left the Stadium in a bad mood.\nThey started booing in the eighth inning and didn’t let up until the final out in a 3-0 loss. It was savage treatment for a team that won 87 games and, let’s face it, lasted longer than 10 others in the American League. Still, the images of Gardner striking out three times, of Alex Rodriguez meekly ending the Bombers’ only rally with a fly ball to shallow center, of Masahiro Tanaka coughing up two home runs in five innings — that’s the kind of disappointment that sticks.\nTo turn it inside out and say the Yankees actually overachieved requires a fairly long leap. It’s not incorrect – there are plenty of reasons to feel good about the Bombers – but not if you’ve grown up thinking they have a special claim on October.\nNot anymore. To say these aren’t the Yankees of the late ’90s is stating the obvious. But these aren’t the same Bombers of a decade ago, or even five-six years past. Since 2013, they have been just another franchise, still hugely wealthy and blessed with a few excellent weapons, trying to keep up with a sport that cares less about money than it does speed, youth and roster flexibility.\nHere’s one way I knew the Yankees stopped thinking of themselves as special. It was the night of the wild-card clinching, when they backed into home-field advantage via an Astros loss to the Diamondbacks. The Yankees were in the midst of an embarrassing final week – losing six of seven to the Orioles and Red Sox, after playing .500 ball in August and September. The Yankees should’ve been fierce, focused, resolute about the challenge ahead. Instead, they acted as if it were New Year’s Eve in the clubhouse, as if they considered themselves lucky to be headed for the play-in game.\nThe Yankees knew in their hearts they were no match for Dallas Keuchel. The Astros were the better team, and effectively won the game after Carlos Gomez’s home run in the fourth inning. That’s what bothered the crowd more than anything.\nThe Yankees never used the Stadium to their advantage. They never stirred. They never made Keuchel or the Astros feel as if they were facing a dangerous opponent.\nI believe Cashman when he said the loss “clearly leaves a frustration” throughout the organization. Many of the GM’s gambles and experiments paid a dividend, including the timely promotions of rookies Luis Severino and Greg Bird, making peace with A-Rod, and sticking with Didi Gregorius, who turned into a slick-fielding shortstop and at least a league-average hitter. Cashman bet on Andrew Miller as the replacement to David Robertson, and that worked out, too.\nBut many of the problems that plagued the Yankees down the stretch will still be there in 2016. Questions about Mark Teixeira’s durability linger, even with his newfound power this season. Ellsbury slumped so badly he was benched Tuesday — a damning indictment for a player the Yankees paid $153 million and still has five years left on his contract. Who knows how fast Ellsbury will decline from here?\nAnd talk about a late-season fade, A-Rod looked exhausted down the stretch. True, he crafted a strong first half and those 33 homers will at least put him in the conversation for Comeback Player of the Year. But Rodriguez batted .191 after Aug. 1, and was unable to summon any of that early-season adrenaline in being held hitless by the Astros.\nAnd what of Tanaka, who looks more and more like a second-tier ace with a fragile elbow. He wasn’t catastrophically bad against the Astros, but failed in the only task the Yankees assigned to him – matching Keuchel inning for inning, zero for zero. Tanaka may or may not ever find his 2014 brilliance, at least while he continues to pitch with a partial tear in his UCL. It’s yet another question that will dog the Yankees when they open camp in February.\nIt won’t be an upbeat spring training. Many of the same players will be back in 2016, and unless there’s a unlikely free agent spending binge – say, for David Price – the empire will continue to feel bogged down.\nThe overhaul fans are asking for largely will have to wait until 2017, when the commitments to A-Rod, Teixeira and CC Sabathia all expire. Until then, the Bombers will try to emphasize the incremental steps forward, even if it’s a lot to ask of fans who can’t get Tuesday night out of their heads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:00:25.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
