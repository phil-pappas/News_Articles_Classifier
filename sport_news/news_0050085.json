It means im about to go preorder.... # 2 Junior Moe @ 10/15/15 04:43 PM Since they are being mocapped I'm hoping for a weekly wrapup show of some sort. I have seen Sekou Smith on NBATV quite a bit lately. Rick Fox is a regular. Not sure about Lang Whitaker, though. Either way, if they are included I'm sure 2K will implement them well. # 3 sactown_13 @ 10/15/15 05:55 PM I hate Rick fox so hard # 4 Quentin32 @ 10/15/15 07:09 PM No way. My mind would explode if The current crew and the nba.com are both in 2k17. 2k why are y'all doing this to me # 5 Rockie_Fresh88 @ 10/15/15 07:11 PM I haven't even touched all the modes this year yet. This 2k17 talk hurts my head # 6 Hot Kidd @ 10/15/15 08:04 PM Leave the hype train st the station for a few more months.

There isn't. Kings got no rings. Just dashed dreams and shattered post-seasons lol.

Just because they don't post photos and captions, that doesn't mean they're not working behind the scenes. It's not like they are a small gaming studio, with a few guys who do everything; I'm sure they have dozens, even hundreds of people working both in the current and future games/features. Also, as a yearly release, NBA 2K needs to be constantly thinking about the \"next game\", and MoCap is just another thing. Those guys they MoCap-ed will be constantly busy when the season starts, to it's not a bad idea to do it now. # 12 strawberryshortcake @ 10/16/15 04:43 AM Quote: Originally Posted by Junior Moe Since they are being mocapped I'm hoping for a weekly wrapup show of some sort .

Weekly wrap-up would be nice, but can 2k at least get the postgame highlights working for the PS4 ... first?? Kind of defeats the purpose if a feature doesn't even properly work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:47:10.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
