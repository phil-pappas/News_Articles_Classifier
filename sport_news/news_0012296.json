Every campaign we start off saying we can do it and we believe it, but there was a bit more belief this time. We were a little bit older, that bit more experienced with a few of us on more than 50 caps. Certain victories gave us even more belief as we went along and, as soon as we got the ball rolling, the momentum just took us.\" \nOn squad being called the golden generation: \n\"It was never for us to say that about ourselves - it was for the media and the public to say. But we knew how good we are and we've proven that. I don't mean to be disrespectful to the side that qualified in 1958, but I think I'm right in saying they didn't qualify outright. So we are actually the first team that have 100 per cent done it. And I take a lot of pride in that.\" \nOn making an impact at Euro 2016: \n\"You have to go there with that ambition. Thierry Henry said something similar a few months ago and we believe it. We know we don't concede too many and we can nick a goal against anybody, so there's no reason we can't. Obviously you might need a bit of luck along the way but we'll be going there trying to upset a few people.\" \nOn the draw in December: \n\"Take anyone. Want to test ourselves against the best and to do that you have to play the best. For massive nations who have been there and won it, the pressure will be on them if they play us. They will be expected to beat us, but we are confident we can beat anybody on our day.\" \nOn the possibility of playing for England: \n\"It was never an option. I was really young at the time. It was literally a one-second conversation. I said, 'Stop, I'm from Wales and love Wales'. Everyone knows how much I love playing for Wales. My grandmother's English but I'm Welsh and I would never want it to happen.\" \nOn whether international football is his favourite part of the game: \n\" Whether it's for Madrid or Wales, I run myself into the ground. I came off with cramp (against Belgium) and I don't think you should do that. The boys have been together for the last eight or nine years. We know each other like brothers, fight for each other and to have that team spirit and togetherness really is special. It makes you want to come away with Wales and enjoy every minute.\" \nOn Welsh passion: \n\"The passion from our players is I would say the best in the world. You never see a nation get behind the team like Wales, whether it's away from home or at home, or whether it's for the football or for the rugby. The anthem is just incredible when it's sung, even in the middle of a game. Everyone pulls together in one direction.\" \nOn Wales manager Chris Coleman: \n\"The circumstances were not easy when he took over as it's not often you take over from a predecessor who has passed away. You have to give Gary Speed credit for what he started and Chris' results weren't great to begin with. But we all believed in him and what he was doing. We turned it around and it shows that if you stick with a manager, even after a few bad results, it works out better in the long term.\" \nOn messages of congratulations: \n\"Not many have got my number! I try to keep as low profile as possible. But I've obviously had a message from Rafa Benitez and people at Madrid. It will be nice to go back and tell the lads, 'We're there, see you in France'.\" \nOn best position: \n\"I definitely feel better in the centre. I can go wide, I can go either side, I can drop deep, I can go further up. In the centre I feel I can get on the more ball more and hopefully I can be more effective and help the team in that position.\" \nOn a shorter summer holiday: \n\"This year it will be two weeks instead of eight. But I'm not complaining because we've never been in this position before and it's something we've always wanted.\" \nWelsh superstar Gareth Bale surprised Sully Sports FC U13s to deliver the 100,000th free kit supplied by the McDonald's accredited club scheme.
