On Friday, photos emerged of \"61-58\" painted in Baylor green on a wall on the TCU campus in Fort Worth. \nIn a joint statement, Baylor athletic director Ian McCaw and TCU athletic director Chris Del Conte condemned the acts of vandalism. McCaw said \"it is most disappointing that the actions of a few cast a negative light on a rivalry that dates back more than a century.\" Del Conte says TCU officials \"are working closely with Baylor and public safety officials at both universities on their investigations.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:23:59.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
