But Seattle isn’t Seattle anymore. And Cam Newton is better than you think.” \nSports Illustrated’s Doug Farrar said the Seahawks are in trouble : \n“And if anybody doubted that the Seahawks were in trouble before this loss … those doubts are right out the window now. The two-time defending NFC champions are sucking wind at 2–4, and coach Pete Carroll had little in the way of answers after his team’s Week 6 loss. His defense, so stout until it ran into the Patriots’ offensive rebirth in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XLIX, has been outmanned and outdone in the fourth quarters of the 2015 season. They’ve been outscored 55–27 in the final frame, and the repeated blunders as the games wind down are certainly a different look for a defense used to imposing its will.” \nDon Banks of Sports Illustrated said the Seahawks are looking very un-Seahawk like : \n“This season is getting almost ridiculously repetitive in Seattle. The two-time defending NFC champions have now blown fourth-quarter leads in all four of their losses, and the meltdown at home Sunday might be the defeat that sends the Seahawks spinning out of control. How many more team meetings can Pete Carroll call to talk about the importance of finishing? How many blows to the psyche of a team still dealing with the specter of the Super Bowl loss can Seattle endure?” \nNFL.com’s Gregg Rosenthal said the defense has issues, but there’s stuff to build on : \n“At 2-4, the Seahawks have some serious ground to make up, but they have a lot to build off offensively from this game. Marshawn Lynch looked like his old despite only rushing for 54 yards, and Jimmy Graham easily had his best day in Seattle, showing off all his athleticism for 140 yards and a score. Note to Panthers: Stop trying to cover Graham with Roman Harper.” \nSheil Kapadia of ESPN.com wrote about how the search for answers continues as the season appears to be slipping away : \n“The Seahawks insist the sky is not falling. They could beat the 49ers and Cowboys, enter the bye 4-4 and still be in the mix for a playoff spot. But it’s just as possible this defense is not as good as it has been the previous two seasons and the offense’s search for identity will continue into December.” \nGrantland’s Bill Barnwell wrote about Newton and the Panthers finally beating Russell Wilson, but also had this to say about the Seahawks’ final defensive sequence : \n“It spoiled what had been an incredible game from (Earl) Thomas, who broke up four passes and had an interception in the first quarter. It also raises more questions about a struggling Seahawks defense that is the miraculous Kam Chancellor forced fumble (and subsequent uncalled illegal batting) away from having blown three fourth-quarter leads in three weeks. It’s one thing for miscommunication to happen when Chancellor is holding out, or another for Williams to get beat. To see these sort of miscommunication issues occur late in games and have it bring down players like Sherman and Thomas? That has to be disheartening if you’re a Seahawks fan. As much as this team missed Chancellor in September and missed Wagner on Sunday, it feels like it also misses departed defensive coordinator Dan Quinn right about now.” \nTom Sorensen of The Charlotte Observer said the sound of silence in CenturyLink Field was particularly sweet for the Panthers and their fans : \n“We anticipated the noise. Coaches did, players did and everybody else did, too. But the sound we didn’t anticipate was the one we heard after the Carolina Panthers scored the winning touchdown with 32 seconds remaining. We heard silence. … Suddenly, (the record crowd of 69,020) had nothing to say. If you had been in CenturyLink Field Sunday, you would have heard the silence, too.” Ed Guzman: 206-464-3191 or eguzman@seattletimes.com .
