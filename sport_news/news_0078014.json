A dynamic, big, strong guy. I listened to our coaches on Sunday first, and they started telling me about him, and then I went and watched him myself, and he's a tremendous player.\" \nCarroo did not practice Tuesday and Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Saturday's game against No. 1 Ohio State at High Point Solutions Stadium. \nThe Big Ten's leader with nine touchdown catches injured his ankle on a scoring play in the third quarter against Indiana and did not return to action. Urban Meyer joining list of best coaches Rutgers hosted \n\"He did a little bit more today,\" Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said after Wednesday's practice. \"Not enough to get him out here on the field, but he's moving in the right direction. Whether that means it will be fast enough to get him on the field Saturday, we won't know that until later in the week.\" \nEarlier in the season, Carroo played against Michigan State after not practicing until Thursday of game week. He was coming off a two-game suspension then and scored three touchdowns in his return. \nIn fact, Carroo has scored three touchdowns in three of the four games he has played this season. \nDoes Flood have a guideline for how many times a player must practice before playing? \n\"It's case-by-case,\" Flood said. \"For a younger player, you'd like to see them out there. Somebody like Leonte, who has played so much football, I don't really have a concern.\" Rutgers football nearly upset No. 1, national champs Miami in 2002 \nIf Carroo cannot go, Carlton Agudosi's role figures to expand. \nIn Carroo's absence, Agudosi had a career-high five catches against Penn State and scored his first career touchdown with Kansas. He came off the bench against Indiana and made three catches for 72 yards. \n\"The big guy came in and played very well,\" Meyer said of the 6-foot-6 Agudosi. \"He's a very good player. Once again, I think (Carroo) is very good, but I think Rutgers' skilled athletes are very good players. So production-wise I thought even last week when (Carroo) left the game, the other guy — I don't have his name in front of me — played very well, and obviously they moved the ball and had a great comeback win.\" \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 8 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LLOz7P TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:42:42.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
