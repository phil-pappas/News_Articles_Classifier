Redwood cheer adviser Rebecca Springer said the competition format the state is trying to implement is STUNT, a competitive team sport derived from cheerleading. STUNT was developed by USA Cheer. CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCompetitive cheerleading will soon be an official sport. \nBeginning in the 2017-18 school year, the California Interscholastic Federation, which governs high school athletics in the state, will classify competitive cheer as a sanctioned sport. \nAssembly Bill 949 was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown on Oct. 7. The bill was introduced by state assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), a former cheerleader and coach. \n“I think it’s a great idea,” Central Section commissioner Jim Crichlow said. “I think the girls will be able to participate in something other than sideline cheer. It’ll give them an opportunity to show off their talents.” \nAccording to Crichlow, a committee is currently being formed to determine a head-to-head format for competition cheer. \nCompetition cheer is not the traditional sideline cheer. In competition cheer, teams perform a routine and compete with other squads. After their performance, they are judged by an official based on difficulty and execution. In sideline cheer, each unit entertains its fans, usually at a sporting event like football or basketball. \nThe law will go into effect in July 2017. \nWith competitive cheer officially a sport, the Central Section will now sponsor 23 sports. \nSo what does this mean for the local cheerleading scene? \nAt Redwood, like most high schools, the Rangers deploy sideline cheer, which runs from the fall through the winter seasons. \nRedwood cheer adviser Rebecca Springer said the competition format the state is trying to implement is STUNT, a competitive team sport derived from cheerleading. STUNT was developed by USA Cheer. \nIn STUNT, squads focus on the athletic and technical elements of cheer. Those components can include anything from jumps, pyramids and tumbling. \nThe head-to-head contest will then be broken down into four quarters, with each period featuring a specific skill — partner stunts, pyramids and tosses, group jumps and tumbling, and team performance. Halftime will be during the second and third quarters. \nEach team will be judged on predetermined routines, which are distributed at the beginning of the season. During game action, the coach with possession gets the opportunity to select which routine both teams will perform. \nAfter the performances, a referee evaluates the execution of the routine and hands out a score. \nSTUNT games are expected to last no longer than an hour. \n“I would love to see a program like STUNT come to Visalia,” Springer said. “Because you’re able to have a co-ed type activity. I think that it’s a great program if they bring it.” \nWith competition starting in 2017, a specific season will need to established. \nTraditional sideline cheer typically ends by February, so to avoid an overlap, Crichlow said the best time for competition cheer may be in the spring. \n“I think there will always be sideline cheer,” Springer said. “And I think it will take us a few years to really see how it (STUNT) will work, but I would love to be the school that pioneers the whole thing.” \nWith the logistics of competition cheer still in development, Redwood athletic director Matt Sozinho said the sport is in the discussion phase with Visalia Unified School District administrators. A decision on whether the district will implement the sport is expected to be made down the road. \nSozinho is a supporter of competition cheer. \n“It provides an opportunity for more students to become more involved in the school,” Sozinho said. “Anytime you’re talking about adding more programs, that’s gives more opportunities for the kids to be engaged.” Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1RV9ohY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:51:57.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
