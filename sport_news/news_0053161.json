I’ve played with a lot of great teammates. But I want to play for a long time, maybe 10 more years. I think that’s probably what my goal is.\"\nIf Brady accomplishes that, he would be as old as late kicker-quarterback George Blanda was when Blanda retired after the 1975 season.\nBrady certainly is showing no signs of slowing down. He has 14 touchdown passes and one interception this season, and the lone pick came on a ball that was bobbled by wide receiver Julian Edelman. Brady was asked if he was serious about playing another 10 years.\n\"Well, it’s not always up to me,\" he said. \"That’s what my goals are, so that’s just what I’m hoping. And it will take a lot to achieve that. Obviously a team has to want you. … I love playing this sport. I love making a commitment to my teammates and my coaches, and hopefully I can do it for a long time.\"\nBrady sidestepped a question about whether the tumultuous off-season he endured for his alleged involvement in the Deflategate scandal has given him extra motivation.\n\"I’ve tried to approach it the same way my entire career and I try to give everything I can,\" he said. \"I try to empty my bucket every week. I think I owe that to my teammates, and I owe that to our coaches.’’ \nEmail: pelzman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:59:27.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
