(AP) - Reserve running back Akrum Wadley ran for 192 yards and tied a school record with four rushing touchdowns to carry No. 17 Iowa over No. 20 Northwestern 40-10 on Saturday. \nWith leading rusher Jordan Canzeri sidelined in the first quarter with an ankle injury, Wadley took over for Iowa (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten). The injury occurred following a short run when Northwestern linebacker Jaylen Prater landed on Canzeri, folding his ankle under a pile of players. \nWadley, who had only eight carries coming into the game, scored his third touchdown on a 2-yard run with 6:42 remaining in the third quarter, extending Iowa's lead to 23-10. His record-tying fourth scoring run, which followed a Northwestern fumble on the Wildcats ensuing drive, came on a 4-yard run that. \nNorthwestern (5-2, 1-2) turned the ball over three times as the Wildcats lost for the second straight week after five consecutive victories. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:41:58.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
