Owner Robert Kraft said he wouldn't contest the sanctions against his team, but a federal judge vacated Brady's suspension before the season and all he's done is lead the Pats to a 4-0 record while putting up ridiculous numbers, even by his lofty standards .\nAnd Sunday night, Brady and the Patriots will continue their quest for world domination when they travel to -- wait for it -- Indianapolis for that AFC Championship Game rematch. Not surprisingly, Brady and coach Bill Belichick said this week that there was no extra motivation, though it's hard to imagine anyone believes them.\nLuckily, Brady's father is free to speak his mind, which is exactly what he did in a conversation with the New York Daily News ' Gary Myers.\n\"The main thing I want is to see them win,\" Tom Brady Sr. said. \"As long as they have one point more than the Colts, I'm fine. That being said, I'd like to see them put 60 points on the board, and love to see Tom throw for 500 yards and eight touchdowns. That's me dreaming. That kind of comes from me.\"\nBrady Sr. wasn't done. \"I don't have any inside information that, 'Yeah, we're going to pick them apart.' Tommy never says that. He always says, 'We're going to win.' \"\nBut we all know the Patriots aren't afraid to run up the score, and they don't even need a reason. And when there is a reason, God help you. Back in October 2007, a month after Spygate broke, the Patriots destroyed a Joe Gibbs-coached Redskins outfit, 52-7. After the game, here's how then-Patriots wide receiver Donte Stallworth explained the points-barrage mentality.\n\"It's just something the coaching staff wants to do,\" Stallworth said at the time . \"We're behind them for whatever they want to do. Whatever play they call, we are going to run it. We've been attacked since the start of the season, so we don't care. Whatever is going on out there, we just go out and play and try to execute what we are doing.\"\nSo, yeah. Whatever Belichick and Brady might say publicly, Sunday's get-together won't be your garden-variety regular-season game. They're out to make a point, and we wouldn't be surprised if Brady Sr. gets his wish. Tom Brady, like winter, is coming.
