It was Pacioretty’s first time in game action this preseason — he saw more than 15 minutes of ice time — as he had been sidelined for 12 weeks after suffering fractures in his tibia during an off-ice workout in July. In September, he was named the 29th team captain of the Montreal franchise and was sporting his new “C” against Ottawa. “It was a very special feeling,” Pacioretty told NHL.com. “It’s obviously just preseason, but I still took a lot of pride in wearing that. After I settled down a little bit, I got back to playing my game and being myself.” Pacioretty didn’t take long to make an impact in the box score, as he assisted on Nathan Beaulieu’s first-period goal. He sent a pass through the crease to set up the tally. “Different plays felt a little weird at times because I hadn’t played in so long, like plays on the wall, getting my timing back,” Pacioretty said. “But I thought as the game went on I got a little bit better.” Pacioretty also told NHL.com that it takes time to get used to the knee brace he was wearing for the first time in a game. “I thought to be able to make a comeback a week before we start the season, he needed to go through that process,” Montreal coach Michel Therrien said. “For sure, the guys that have been there since Day One, their level of conditioning is a bit higher, and he’s starting right now. So that’s stage one, but it’s nice to see him back out there.” Montreal is taking on the Senators again in a final preseason game on Saturday and will open the regular season on Wednesday, Oct. 7, against the Maple Leafs in Toronto.
