DAKOTA -- It was an emotional night for Forreston's volleyball coach. And it wasn't because her Cardinals lost in straight sets to Dakota (25-17, 25-17). Thursday night marked the first time that Shannon Williams returned to coach her new team in the gym where she built a dynasty with the Indians and experienced a lot of memorable moments. \"It's definitely different,\" Williams said of being back in the place she called home for six years. \"Obviously there are a lot of good memories here. Dakota's a great place and I'll always be thankful for the time I had here.\" Williams won a lot with Dakota in an historical six-year tenure that included the program's only state title in 2011, five consecutive regional titles, four straight conference titles and three state final appearances. At Forreston, she's starting over with a program that hasn't had much success on the volleyball court in recent years and it's been a struggle in her first year at the helm. The Cardinals are 7-14 with only one conference victory and Williams knew what some of her former Dakota players would bring to the table in her return. \"We thought we could come in and play well and I thought that would make me feel better about coming back,\" Williams said. \"But that's OK. They're great kids and I know a lot of them very well and I knew what they were going to do. I know their strengths and weaknesses and we just couldn't capitalize on that. \"But we're going to get there.\" The Indians (11-8, 5-2) bounced back from a straight set loss to Aquin on Tuesday with a much more solid performance against the Cards. Dakota used a 9-0 run in the second set to put Forreston away. \"We worked together and we were more supportive as a team,\" first-year Dakota coach Annie Nelson said. \"We were able to just put balls down that we couldn't against Aquin because of their defense. We just found the holes and were able to work better together.\" Junior Hannah Ryan had six kills to lead Dakota, which has had a solid season despite its youth and lack of height. The Indians currently sit in second place in the NUIC East, two games behind Aquin. \"I think that they just want to show everybody, not only Forreston, how good they are,\" Nelson said. \"I think we were underrated this year coming into the season. Everyone's really excited to show that even though we're young and really small that we're tough and we're going to be tough contenders for the next couple of years.\" By Adam Kradle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:57:59.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
