After Jon Lester started and lost Saturday's Game 1 of the National League championship series to the New York Mets, the Cubs needed Arrieta to get them back to Chicago all even. Arrieta was not his usual sharp self for the second straight start, and the Cubs fell 4-1 to the Mets, and they await Tuesday's Game 3 down 2-0. Sunday's game certainly wasn't pivotal or do-or-die, but with manager Joe Maddon waiting until the afternoon to announce his Game 3 starter and hedge on Game 4, Arrieta's start was pretty important. \"Of course you want to go back 50-50, 1 and 1,\" Maddon said before the game. \"It's never the end of the world. Of course, you're trying to get back home 1 and 1. I don't know if it will totally make a difference in our mindset leaving, but again, let's win tonight, get back home and take it from there.\" Arrieta may well win the Cy Young Award in the National League after he went 22-6 with a 1.77 ERA during the regular season. He was brilliant on the national stage by tossing a complete-game shutout at Pittsburgh in the wild-card playoff game. But Arrieta lacked his command both against the Cardinals in the division series and again Sunday night. The Mets touched him for 3 runs on 3 hits in the first inning, with 2 runs coming on Daniel Murphy's fifth home run of the postseason. By the time the inning was over Arrieta had thrown 30 pitches. He managed to gut out 5 innings, throwing 94 pitches and giving up 4 hits and 4 runs. The 3 runs in the first inning were important, especially as Maddon has talked all year of striking first. \"Like I said all year, we talked about scoring first all year,\" the manager said. \"They got us (Saturday). Murphy hits a home run. The other day, the Cardinals get the home run in the first inning to get (the Cubs) behind. The point with that is I never want our guys thinking the game is over. You're talking about if you can get ahead and have the kind of Jake Arrieta pitching that you should, it could make a difference in that particular game. \"Philosophically, it's always going to be score first. I've always felt that way. I'm always going to say that. If you could put a couple runs on the board for Jake early, it definitely makes the other side's job more difficult.\" The Mets scored another run in the third inning, and their pitcher, Noah Syndergaard, was doing his best to keep the Cubs at bay, even though he was running his pitch count up. Cubs batters got very little going against Syndergaard until the sixth, when they finally scored a run. With one out, Dexter Fowler singled and went to second on a wild pitch. After Kyle Schwarber struck out for the third time in the game, Kris Bryant lined an RBI double off the wall in left field. Mets manager Terry Collins then came out and got Syndergaard, who threw 101 pitches in 5â…” innings. Lefty Jonathon Niese came in and struck out Anthony Rizzo. Even though the Mets were extended to five games by the Dodgers in the other division series and had to start Jacob deGrom in the final game of that series, they still run out good pitching, and the Cubs will have to match it. But there's a big drop-off in quality after Lester and Arrieta. Maddon said Sunday Kyle Hendricks would start Game 3 and that it was likely Jason Hammel would go in Game 4. However they have to do it, the Cubs are going to have to pitch with the Mets if they're to stay in this series. \"It's been my experience that it really turns that way,\" Maddon said. \"I thought yesterday Jon pitched really well. I'm not saying that (Mets starter Matt) Harvey pitched way better than him. We hit some balls well that were outs. So I just think both pitchers pitched well. \"They got a knock or two that we didn't get. But overall, you do have to really pitch on a nightly basis. It's rare that two teams will go out there and bludgeon each other and just score a bunch of runs. It happens. It's already happened in the postseason, but it's rare, especially when you're facing Arrieta vs. Syndergaard. That's two really good arms. You really anticipate low scoring, the weather, all that stuff, is the anticipation. But you never know.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:30:32.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
