We've only lost two games this year, we have drawn eight of the last nine or something ridiculous like that,\" the midfielder said, quoted by the Liverpool Echo. \n\"We feel we can perform a lot better but we're not losing the games, looking on the positive side. \n\"We're not a million miles away. We know we need to improve and know we can improve. \n\"It's going to take one game where we have a bit of luck and every shot goes in for us and we could go on a run where we are scoring three, four, five goals a game.\" \nLiverpool take on Bournemouth in the League Cup on Wednesday in a game that could help bring their stuttering season to life. \nThe Cherries have let in 10 goals in their last two games, against Manchester City and Tottenham, and with Benteke in the side, Liverpool will fancy their chances. \nThe Belgian, who is playing his way back after a hamstring injury, came on at halftime against Southampton and added an immediate threat to a side that had looked largely toothless before his introduction. \nHe put the hosts ahead with a towering header and Milner acknowledged how important the 32.5 million pound signing was to Liverpool's cause. \n\"To get Christian back is great. The strikers we have at the club offer different things, they're a good mix, and there will be a lot of changes to the way we play,\" the England international said. \n(Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Ian Ransom ) \nOur top news photography from this week.
