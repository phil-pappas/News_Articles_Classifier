We came out with a little bit of an edge in the third period. There was some frustration involved.\n“We lost four straight games at the end of last season and hadn't won a game yet in (pre-season), we were getting a little frustrated around here. It's definitely a lot more positive feeling than if we had mailed it in during the third period. One we thing we hang our hat on is that regardless, we're a proud group, a group with a lot of passion and a group that plays the game the right way. We've been a half step off here the last few games and in the third period, we got things back on track.”\nThe Jets (1-2-2) face the Calgary Flames on Thursday at MTS Centre before travelling to Alberta for a rematch on Saturday night at the Scotiabank Saddledome to close out the pre-season.\nWhile much of the talk going into the contest revolved around how the trio of Andrew Ladd, Bryan Little and Alex Burmistrov would fit together in their first game action, the experiment lasted only two periods before Wheeler was reunited with his longtime linemates.\nLadd provided a tip-in goal (with Wheeler supplying the screen) after a point shot from Tyler Myers with 50.9 seconds left in the third period and Ondrej Pavelec on the Jets bench in favour of an extra attacker to send the game to the three-on-three overtime period.\n“We still have another level to get to, but I liked the way we battled back and found a way to win the game,” said Ladd. “It's just that extra level of compete and intensity, maybe an extra quickness to our game that we need to get to that we had last year. Now that we have most of our regulars in, we need to start working towards that.”\nDrew Stafford had the other third-period goal for the Jets, converting a perfect pass from Nikolaj Ehlers, who produced his first point in four pre-season games.\nEhlers has been relatively quiet offensively as he works on playing a more responsible defensive game, but he wasn't worried about his lack of production.\n“I've played pretty well and played the game that they play here in Winnipeg,” said Ehlers. “I wasn't scared. I knew that it was going to come.”\nProbably the best line for the Jets for most of this night was the fourth unit of Andrew Copp between Chris Thorburn and Nic Petan.\nPetan helped his chances of making the club by playing a smart game, showing his vision and creativity on the power play and at even strength.\nHe also drew a minor penalty in the third period that led to a power-play goal from Stafford with five minutes remaining in regulation.\nIt's easy to see why head coach Paul Maurice likes the skill set that Petan brings to the table.\nRegardless of what the final decision ends up being, Petan is making the decision to consider sending him down awfully difficult right now.\nKen.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nWinnipeg Jets\nJets rally back to edge Senators in overtime\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Tuesday, September 29, 2015 10:50 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 12:30 AM EDT\nIt took them a bit longer than they hoped, but the Winnipeg Jets finally flipped the switch.\nAlthough Tuesday marked the first time in the pre-season that the Jets played what is considered to be close to their regular lineup, they're running out of dress rehearsals to start building better habits, so this is a case of better late than never.\nJust when the Jets were looking like they were on their way to a fifth consecutive loss, they rallied with four unanswered goals, capped by game-winner from Mark Scheifele at two minutes of overtime to complete the comeback and earn a 4-3 win over the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday night at the MTS Centre.\nThe Jets (1-2-2) face the Calgary Flames on Thursday at MTS Centre before travelling to Alberta for a rematch on Saturday night at the Scotiabank Saddledome.\nJets goalie Ondrej Pavelec wasn't overly sharp early in this one, but two of the goals he allowed changed direction off the stick of teammate Toby Enstrom.\nTop ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-09-30T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:01:25.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
