(Image Source: Tony Ding/AP Photo) \nHere’s a look at some game notes from Michigan’s 31-0 win over BYU. Since all the scoring occurred in the first half and the second half was (insert Marv Albert’s voice) extended garbage time , most of the notes are from the first and second quarters. \n-The Pass Defense Was Amazing: Look, you can certainly make the case that the Michigan Wolverines benefited from facing BYU at the end of a tough four-week stretch that included three dramatic games that went wire-to-wire. However, it would be unfair not to give credit where credit is due. \nThe Wolverines limited the Cougars to 55 passing yards …not 155 passing yards… just 55 passing yards ! Michigan’s defense forced BYU QB Tanner Mangum to 16 incompletions on 28 attempts for a ghastly completion percentage of 42.9 percent. He completed over 60 percent of his passes in the first three games of the season, and threw for 309 yards in a win over Boise State and 244 yards in a one-point loss to UCLA, currently ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll. \nIt’s not that Mangum was inaccurate. He simply had nowhere to go with the football. Corners Channing Stribling , Jourdan Lewis and Jeremy Clark were all over BYU’s wide receivers. Sometimes even when Mangum completed a pass the Wolverines had great coverage. After four-straight incompletions to start the game, Mangum connected with Devon Blackmon for 14 yards (longest BYU pass of the game) on a throw that should have been intercepted by Stribling. The junior coverman was in position to pick off the pass but instead deflected the ball to Blackmon. \nIt wasn’t just the defensive backs that played well. The pass rush was strong too. Three plays after Stribling’s shoulda-woulda-coulda INT, 307-pound DE Willie Henry burst through up the middle for a sack and a 10-yard loss pushing BYU back to their own 46-yard line, forcing a punt. DE Taco Charlton didn’t earn a sack but he got pressure coming off the edge and pushed Mangum back inside where Henry was waiting. \nThis was the most active the front seven has been. DT Chris Wormley , who has been a stud for most of the season, was relatively quiet, but others stepped up against the Cougars. Backup Maurice Hurst was especially active in the first half getting penetration up the middle, including a second-quarter sack of Mangum, when he split a double team to get into the backfield. \nWhen interior linemen like Wormley, Hurst and Henry are able to get penetration it should open things up for edge rushers like BUCK Mario Ojemudia , who earned his first full sack of the season. The Wolverines need Ojemudia to step up as a pass-rushing presence when they play superior offenses like Michigan State and Ohio State. \nAgainst the run, NT Ryan Glasgow had a pair of TFLs, as he blew up a couple of plays before they even got going. Michigan held BYU to 50 yards rushing on 22 carries (2.3 YPC). Interior linemen Glasgow, Hurst and Henry combined for four tackles for loss, including two sacks. Add Wormley, who has seven tackles for loss on the season, and the Wolverines are getting tremendous production from their three-man line through four games. That makes the entire defense better. \n-Smith Goes Beast Mode: Did you see RB De’Veon Smith’s 60-yard TD run ? Marshawn Lynch would be proud. Smith broke out of a scrum when it looked like there were only minimal yards to be gained and then he absolutely clowned BYU DB Michael Davis in the open field as he tossed the defender aside a la Leonard Fournette . A week after Ty Isaac led UM in rushing, Smith re-established himself as Michigan’s lead runner with 128 yards on 16 carries (7.8 YPC) before leaving the game with an ankle injury. His status for Saturday against Maryland is uncertain. \n-Rudock Better, But: This was probably QB Jake Rudock’s best all-around game this season, however he still wasn’t very sharp, completing a season-low 56 percent of his passes. It was the first game that he didn’t throw an INT and that’s a major positive. But for the most part he was aided by nice catches from his wide outs (please watch the ridiculous catch by Amara Darboh below, if you haven’t seen it you’ll thank me), as well as some nice play calling/designs, which led to wide open receivers. Rudock maybe made his best throw of the season on a somewhat forgettable play with the Wolverines already up 28-0. He connected on a 12-yard gain to Jehu Chesson on 2 nd & 11. The pass was thrown before Chesson turned and was into the wind, outside the numbers, as Rudock stepped into his throw with good footwork, allowing him to get enough zip on the ball. He needs to do more of that. Maybe what Rudock did best was run with the football, twice tucking and scrambling for touchdowns in the first half. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
