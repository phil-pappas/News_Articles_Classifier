We formed a committee, set a date for our first banquet and elected Danny as our area chairman.” \nLillis said that other committee members who worked on that first DU dinner were Frank Looney, John Brennan, Bert McJimsey, Gerald Owens and Bill Massenburg, all local names of enthusiastic hunters and ardent wildlife conservationists that just about anyone who has lived in these parts for a few years is sure to recognize. \nWhen it came time to hold the first Texoma DU dinner — in the nation’s bicentennial year of 1976 — Lillis said the committee wasn’t sure what to expect. \n“The first banquet was held at the Sherman Municipal Building Ballroom,” he recalled. “We had about 80 people attending that night and we cleared — in net/net income — about $1,300.” \nThe next year, Lillis said that things were a little bit better and the income of the Texoma DU chapter went up to “…around $2,500.” \n“By the fourth year in 1979, the Texoma chapter had a net/net income of $10,000.00 with about 150 people attending our annual banquet,” said Lillis. “By the early 1980s, we decided to do additional events and started hosting Greenwing events for youth 17 or under along with having some sponsor events at the Denison Rod and Gun Club.” \nEventually, the group outgrew the Sherman Municipal Building Ballroom as attendance surged upwards towards 275 attendees. \n“We held an event at the Sherman Elks Club one year and later on, with the help of Don Booth, we were able to move out to the old Perrin Field and the Grayson Flying Service Hangar,” said Lillis. “Attendance grew even more at the aircraft hangar, ranging from 350 to over 500 depending on the year.” \nEventually, the Texoma DU chapter would even outgrow the aircraft hangar, moving to the Mayor Arena at Loy Lake Park in Denison, where the annual October event stayed until last year. \n“Last fall, the chapter held it’s annual banquet at the Ray Davis Hangar for the first time,” said Lillis. “And of course, that’s where we gathered the other night too. We have been very lucky to be able to host our banquet the last couple of years in this first class facility. Mr. Davis has been very generous in his support of our local DU chapter.” \nWhile chapter chairmen have changed down through the years, along with the committee member makeup and those attending and spending their money to help keep the ducks flying, the one constant through all of the Texoma dinners has been Lillis, who eventually moved from being a non-paid volunteer with DU to a full-time employee beginning in the late 1990s. \n“I worked as a Senior Regional Director for DU from 1997 until I retired in December 2013,” said Lillis. “As a volunteer that first year in 1976, I never dreamed that I would one day be working for Ducks Unlimited. I’ve always had a passion for waterfowl, for waterfowl hunting and for the habitat that all ducks, geese and wildlife need to have in order to thrive. I’m passionate about the work that DU does and have been for many years. I felt that way back in 1976 and I still feel that same way today, some 40 years later.” \nDuring that time, as a non-paid volunteer and eventually as a full-time employee, Lillis has seen a lot of money raised for the ducks. \n“I would say that during the past 40 years, by my estimates, the Texoma DU chapter has raised in the neighborhood of two million dollars for waterfowl and wetlands conservation,” said Lillis. “The 40th anniversary dinner the other night, it drew approximately 380 attendees and I think when all of the figures are finalized, we will raise in excess of $50,000 in net/net dollars. \n“In fact, the other night was so good that our live auction, emceed by Doug Rodgers, raised more than $20,000 alone. And as always, that is money that will once again go to help support DU’s important work in Canada, the U.S. and in Mexico.” \nWhile Lillis has been a constant fixture at the Texoma DU dinners down through the years, he is a humble man who isn’t fond of receiving praise or accolades for all of his work. Which is why in true Lillis fashion, he deferred any credit for the local chapter’s success, instead pointing to the dozens of individuals who have served as Texoma DU area chairman and committee members down through the years. \n“The leadership from past and present committees, that is what has accounted for the Texoma chapter’s amazing success,” he said. “And we’ve been very blessed to have had some very generous supporters, sponsors and businesses down through the years who believe in Ducks Unlimited and its mission. These individual supporters, DU sponsors and local businesses have given the Texoma DU chapter a strong foundation and have allowed it to exist and thrive for the past 40 years.” \nIf this year’s dinner was a giant celebration for Lillis and many others as they reflected on 40 years of hard work to keep the wetlands wet and the ducks and geese flying south each and every fall, the night also carried a somber tone too as the Texoma Chapter remembered the late Jerry Paul Higgins, a longtime DU member and loyal supporter, along with the late veterinarian Dr. John Brakebill. \n“Once again, we had a special gun raffle in Jerry Paul’s memory,” said Lillis. “And we dedicated this year’s dinner to John, who passed away not too long ago. John Brakebill served as a committee member with us for several years and was actually the area chairman for the Texoma DU chapter back in 1985. They were both great guys, they loved DU and we miss them dearly.” \nWhen the last dollar had been raised on Tuesday night, Lillis ended his 40th Texoma DU dinner the same way that he did four decades ago — by staying to the bitter end, putting up tables, boxing up DU merchandise and memorabilia, making sure that the funds raised were headed in the direction of DU’s Memphis, Tenn. headquarters and by helping sweep up and turn the lights off for yet another year. \nBut this time, after 40 such gatherings, Sherman’s Mr. Duck was perhaps a bit philosophical before he drove away from his latest DU fundraiser. \n“Had I not gone to that first meeting back in 1976 and had I not become a Ducks Unlimited volunteer, I would have never had the opportunity to have met so many friends and fellow duck hunters down through the years,” he smiled. “I’ve met so many people who are my good friends to this very day, as well as many young people who like myself, became DU volunteers, many of whom I was able to coach along the way in my work as a regional director.” \nOne of those has been yours truly, as Lillis has become one of the closest and dearest friends that I’ve ever had - even if he makes fun of my calling and shooting ability. \nAnd who knows, maybe one day soon, he’ll be sweeping up and turning out the lights yet again, this time after coaching the next generation of the Burkhead clan in what it means to love ducks, duck hunting and the local organization known as Texoma DU.
