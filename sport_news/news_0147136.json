Senior quarterback Vad Lee says, \"That's something that we'll always look back upon. When we're old and washed up we'll look back and say we were the first team to go 5-0 in JMU history.\" Head coach Everett Withers adds, \"This is the 44th edition of JMU football. That's not very old. It really amazes me that there hasn't been another team that's been 5-0. Again, our saying is, the best thing about being 5-0 is the opportunity to work hard and try to be 6-0.\" The Seawolves had the 4th best scoring defense in the nation coming into the game, but JMU had 519 yards of total offense in the victory. Vad Lee completed 19-of-29 passes for 225 yards and a touchdown, and also ran for 91 yards and a score. The Dukes' defense had three sacks against Stony Brook, and junior linebacker Gage Steele tied a career-high with 18 tackles. \"We want to be a physical team.\" says Steele. \"All-around, on both on offense and defense. It's something we strive to do. We still got things to work on. We're going to keep striving to be a physical team.\" James Madison returns to action next Saturday at Towson.
