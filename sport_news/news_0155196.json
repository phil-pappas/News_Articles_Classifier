However, they will no longer make all the calls after the reviews, as some will now be done in the Secaucus, New Jersey facility that opened last season. \nThose will include determinations such as whether a shot was a 2- or 3-pointer, or whether it beat the shot clock or end of quarter buzzer. Out of bounds calls and goaltending rulings also will be handled by the replay center. \nThe NBA says the modifications were unanimously approved by owners Wednesday. The league believes the changes can speed up games. \nRulings on flagrant and clear-path fouls, and player altercations will continue to be made by the three game officials.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:53:45.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
