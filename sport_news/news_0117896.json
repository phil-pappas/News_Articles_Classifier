After playing three games in Toronto, they flew back to Kansas City and arrived about 11:45 p.m. at Kauffman Stadium. Dozens of fans were there to welcome the team home.\n\"They all looked really tired, really good,\" said Royals fan Daniel Goodman. \"But, I suppose coming off a loss and having to fly and everything, that's probably what happened.\"\nFelicia McCubbins went to the stadium just to see her favorite player, Salvador Perez.\n\"I was so excited, I screamed really loud,\" said McCubbins. \"I just really love Salvy!\"\nSome fans said they actually wanted to the Royals to lose so they could finish the series at home. That being said, McCubbins said now, they need a win.\n\"I hope that we take it and we don't play around with it,\" she said. \"I hope we come out strong and fierce and ready for blood.\"\nRoyals manager Ned Yost thanked fans for coming out to the the stadium and even signed dozens of autographs.\nIn his post-game interview Wednesday night, Yost made it clear that despite the loss, he’s still proud of the team’s performance in Toronto.\n\"In reality, your goal is to come to Toronto in a kind of a foreign environment and a hostile environment and at least win one,\" he said. \"Then, you get to go home and win one there and the series is over.\"\nYost and Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura will address the media Thursday afternoon before a voluntary practice. Ventura will start Game 6. First pitch is set for 7:07 p.m. Friday.\n\"We really wanted to play four games in our park, and we're taking a 3-2 lead back to where we are comfortable and back to our home fans,\" Yost said.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
