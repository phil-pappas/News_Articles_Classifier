The Uzbek, who upset top seed K Yeraliyev of Kazakhstan in the second round, won 3-0 on points in a closely-fought 56kg semifinal as the Indian settled for a bronze. \n\nShiva, who became only the third Indian pugilist to win a medal at the World Championship, will now compete against Belarus' Dzmitry Asanau, who lost to Ireland's Michael Conlan 0-3, for Olympic quota on Tuesday. \n\n\"I am thankful to god that I reached till this level. I have Rio qualification in my mind and already thinking about my Tuesday bout. Today's bout could have been in my favour as I didn't expect 3-0 score in the first round. If it was 2-1, things would have been different. But I accept my defeat,\" Shiva told TOI from Doha on Sunday . \n\n\"I feel no pressure and I'm feeling confident of my next bout,\" Shiva added. With his bronze, Shiva has equaled the feats of Vijender Singh (2009) and Vikas Krishan at the World Championship. \n\nThe Asian Championship bronze medalist began on a good note but the Uzbek looked more aggressive of the two. He couldn't impress the judges as they scored in favour of the Uzbek. The duo returned with a point to prove and Shiva looked a shade better but failed to catch up on the score. After trailing in the first two rounds, Shiva bounced back strongly in the third and opened with a flurry of punches at his opponent. Although he started to tire towards the end of the round, the honours went to the Indian boxer. \n\nChief coach GS Sandhu complimented his ward for putting up a tough fight despite trailing in the first two rounds. \"Shiva boxed well. He was under pressure since he had lost to the Uzbek in the Asian semifinal last month. But today was a close bout, it could have been anybody's. To me Shiva is a winner,\" Sandhu said. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:21:52.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
