If we had that in Formula One every weekend we would probably go crazy because it is too exciting. I'd love to have that with me and Sebastian.\" \nWhile that fight may occur in 2016, Hamilton is wary of the Scuderia in Russia and knows Mercedes cannot afford to rest on their laurels at the Russian Grand Prix despite dominating in Sochi last year. \n\"They have obviously been quick in a couple of races, they have had a few wins, one of them was right behind Nico in the last race so they've obviously got good pace and they still have tokens for their engines so they will continue to improve,\" he added. \n\"I don't know if they are going to use, or will have improved by this weekend, but they are a serious threat and I really can't predict the future. All I know is we will continue to push so they have got to have their wits about them as we are not going to give up.\" \nMeanwhile, with Vettel's former team Red Bull issuing another threat to quit the sport, Hamilton told reporters he didn't understand the former world champions' attitude now they are no longer winning regularly. \n\"It seems really odd for me, having witnessed Red Bull's success and then the moment that they don't have success they get upset about it,\" he said. \n\"I've not seen that with any other team. Growing up watching Formula One, I never noticed that with Ferrari, when they lost the championship after having successes - I don't remember, maybe they did - but I didn't hear them complain. \n\"You just have to keep pushing forwards. There's no reason for them to give up: they've got great drivers; they've got a great pedigree; they've incredible success; they still have a pretty awesome car. \n\"All those people that have a job, are they going to get rid of all those people through something that's not the biggest end? It's still a success. You just have to work hard at it.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:03:23.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
