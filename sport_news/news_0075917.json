(Photo: Greg Bartram-USA TODAY Sports) \nIt's not necessarily happy days for the state's Big Ten teams. Indiana lost in devastating fashion, surrendering a 25-point second half lead at home to Rutgers , while Purdue continues to struggle to find its conference footing and has now lost five in a row . \nHere are this week's Big Ten power rankings from Journal & Courier Purdue Insider Mike Carmin: EAST \n1. Ohio State (7-0, 3-0) \nMaybe it was the black uniforms that made J.T. Barrett the convincing choice as the team's top quarterback. More likely it was his four touchdowns. Saturday: at Rutgers \n2. Michigan State (7-0, 3-0) \nThe Spartans needed a miracle to beat the Wolverines. It happened. Saturday: vs. Indiana \n3. Michigan (5-2, 2-1) \nIt will take two weeks to get over losing to Michigan State in that fashion. Saturday: Bye \n4. Penn State (5-2, 2-1) \nReaching eight wins is possible before closing with Michigan and Michigan State. Saturday: at Maryland Will IU football get another chance to handle success? \n5. Rutgers (3-3, 1-2) \nCoach Kyle Flood returns from a three-game suspension and watched the Scarlet Knights stun Indiana after trailing by 25 points late in the third quarter. Saturday: vs. Ohio State \n6. Indiana (4-3, 0-3) \nEpic collapse. Forget about the next three games - Michigan State, Iowa and Michigan. The season comes down to winning at Maryland and Purdue. Saturday: at Michigan State \n7. Maryland (2-4, 0-2) \nNot sure the bye week will cure the Terrapins. Saturday: vs. Penn State WEST \nHawkeyes running back Akrum Wadley (25) runs the ball during the second half of the game against the Northwestern Wildcats at Ryan Field. (Photo: Caylor Arnold-USA TODAY Sports) \n1. Iowa (7-0, 3-0) \nThe beat goes on for the Hawkeyes, who lost running back Jordan Canzeri to a leg injury at Northwestern. Akrum Wadley steps in and rushes for 204 yards and four touchdowns. Saturday: Bye \n2. Wisconsin (5-2, 2-1) \nMore passing attempts than rushing attempts is working, for now. Saturday: at Illinois \n3. Northwestern (5-2, 1-2) \nNice run while it lasted. The Wildcats have allowed 78 points the last two games. Saturday: at Nebraska \nâ€‹ 4. Illinois (4-2, 1-1) \nThe Illini likely won't end up this high, but no one else has earned this spot yet. Saturday: vs. Wisconsin Despite 1-6 mark, Boilers focused on staying together \n5. Nebraska (3-4, 1-2) \nThe schedule sets up nicely for the Huskers to hit November with a 5-4 record. Saturday: vs. Northwestern \n6. Minnesota (4-3, 1-2) \nWho are the real Gophers? The team that walloped Purdue or the one that's been outscored 75-28 by Northwestern and Nebraska? Saturday: Bye \n7. Purdue (1-6, 0-3)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:05:21.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
