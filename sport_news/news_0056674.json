Huh) (Photo: AP) \nBEARS 22, RAIDERS 20 \nCHICAGO — Jay Cutler threw for two touchdowns and redeemed himself following an interception by helping set up a 49-yard field goal by Robbie Gould in the closing seconds Sunday, leading the Chicago Bears to a 22-20 victory over the Oakland Raiders. \nIt was the Bears’ first win under John Fox. \nThe Raiders (2-2) grabbed the lead on a field goal by Sebastian Janikowski with just over two minutes remaining that was set up by an interception by Charles Woodson deep in Oakland territory. \nCutler then led Chicago (1-3) from its 20 to the Oakland 32 before Gould nailed the winner in the closing seconds. \nFILL THE STATS SHEET : Track teams and players all day long \nFALCONS 48, TEXANS 21 \nATLANTA — Devonta Freeman scored three more touchdowns and the Atlanta Falcons remained unbeaten, romping to a 48-21 victory over the hapless Houston Texans on Sunday. \nFreeman, who took over as the starting running back after rookie Tevin Coleman sustained a rib injury in Week 2, has scored six TDs in the last two games. The Falcons improved to 4-0 for only the fourth time in franchise history. \nFreeman had touchdown runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards. He set up another score with a 44-yard reception. \nNothing went right for the Texans (1-3). Quarterback Ryan Mallett was yanked after the Falcons built a 42-0 lead. Running back Arian Foster made his season debut after tearing his groin early in training camp, but he couldn’t find any room to run. \nIn fact, he had the ball knocked out of his hands by one of his own teammates, leading to a Falcons touchdown. \nBENGALS 36, CHIEFS 21 \nCINCINNATI — Andy Dalton added to his streak of impressive game and big plays, throwing a 55-yard touchdown pass on the run, and the Cincinnati Bengals stayed unbeaten with a 36-21 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. \nThe Bengals (4-0) matched the third-best start in franchise history, two wins shy of the club record. \nDalton has been the thread throughout the wins, ascending to the top of the AFC passer list. He had another spot-on day, completing 17 of 24 for 321 yards with the long touchdown pass to Brandon Tate during a scramble. \nIt was another rough day all around for Kansas City (1-3). Alex Smith was sacked five times, the Chiefs settled for Cairo Santos’ club-record seven field goals, and the defense couldn’t keep up with another one of the NFL’s top passers. \nPANTHERS 37, BUCCANEERS 23 \nTAMPA, Fla. — Cam Newton threw for two touchdowns and Josh Norman returned one of Carolina’s four interceptions of Jameis Winston for his second TD of the season as the Panthers remained unbeaten with a 37-23 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. \nNewton tossed scoring passes of 6 and 12 yards to Ted Ginn Jr. A week after making a game-saving interception in the end zone against New Orleans, Norman scored on a 46-yard runback and later returned a another pick 34 yards to set up a second TD. \nTight end Ed Dickson rumbled 57 yards after recovering a fumble to score in the third quarter. \nThe Panthers improved to 4-0 for the first time since 2003, when they began with five straight victories. The Bucs (1-3), have lost five straight in the NFC South rivalry and have dropped 11 consecutive home games. \nGIANTS 24, BILLS 10 \nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Rashad Jennings broke three tackles to score on a 51-yard touchdown catch midway through the fourth quarter in helping the New York Giants seal a 24-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday. \nEli Manning went 20 of 35 for 212 yards and three touchdowns in leading the Giants (2-2) to their second straight win. New York’s defense did the rest with Prince Amukamara stripping receiver Robert Woods of the ball to force a fumble with 3:41 left. \nThe Giants limited Buffalo to a combined 77 yards and two first downs on its first nine possessions. And then the Bills came away with no points on two drives into the red zone. \nThe second drive ended with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and J.T. Thomas stopping running back Karlos Williams for no gain on fourth-and-goal from the 1. \nThe Bills (2-2) were flagged 17 times for 135 yards. \nREDSKINS 23, EAGLES 20 \nLANDOVER, Md. — Kirk Cousins threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon with 26 seconds left Sunday to give the Washington Redskins a 23-20 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. \nStarting at their own 10 with a little more than six minutes remaining, the Redskins (2-2) drove 90 yards on 15 plays to take the lead for good in a back-and-forth game. \nCousins finished 31 for 46 for 290 yards, the one TD — and, most importantly, no turnovers. He did fumble a snap in the first half at Philadelphia’s 1, but recovered it himself and plunged forward for a touchdown, with the help of a big push from rookie running back Matt Jones. \nSam Bradford threw three second-half touchdown passes for the Eagles (1-3), but their new kicker, Caleb Sturgis, missed an extra-point attempt and a 33-yard field-goal try. \nPANTHERS 37, BUCCANEERS 23 \nTAMPA, Fla. — Cam Newton threw for two touchdowns and Josh Norman returned one of Carolina’s four interceptions of Jameis Winston for his second TD of the season as the Panthers remained unbeaten with a 37-23 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. \nNewton tossed scoring passes of 6 and 12 yards to Ted Ginn Jr. A week after making a game-saving interception in the end zone against New Orleans, Norman scored on a 46-yard runback and later returned a another pick 34 yards to set up a second TD. \nTight end Ed Dickson rumbled 57 yards after recovering a fumble to score in the third quarter. \nThe Panthers improved to 4-0 for the first time since 2003, when they began with five straight victories. The Bucs (1-3), have lost five straight in the NFC South rivalry and have dropped 11 consecutive home games. \nJETS 27, DOLPHINS 14 \nLONDON — Chris Ivory ran for a career-high 166 yards and a touchdown, and Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for 218 and another score Sunday to lead the New York Jets over the Miami Dolphins 27-14 at Wembley Stadium. \nIvory ran in from 3 yards on New York’s first possession in the 12th regular-season NFL game played in London, but the first to feature division rivals. \nFitzpatrick finished with 16 of 29, including a 58-yard completion to Brandon Marshall on the team’s first play from scrimmage. \nThe Jets improved to 3-1 while the Dolphins dropped to 1-3. \nThe Dolphins got their first score when Ryan Tannehill completed an 8-yard pass to Jake Stoneburner after a pair of pass interference calls gave Miami 58 yards on back-to-back penalties. The Jets committed 14 penalties for 163 yards. 8 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
