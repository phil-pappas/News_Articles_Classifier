But Vigneault kept whatever reaction he had to the news private, though he hinted – and it would be logical – he does not approve of a coach being fired seven games into a season.\n\"I have real specific thoughts on stuff like that but I'll keep it to myself, it'll only get me in trouble,\" Vigneault said after practice before being asked about Tortorella. \"No comments on Torts.\"\nSome of Tortorella's former players did voice their opinion, naturally caring to publicly remember the positive things about Tortorella's tenure with the Rangers from 2009-13.\n\"He always challenged players in a good way,\" said goalie Henrik Lundqvist, who will make his seventh start of the season tonight. \"He always tried to push players to reach their full potential. He was a good motivator in the way he could speak.\n\"I thought he was a really good coach here, he did a lot of good things for the organization,\" Lundqvist added.\nThe Rangers reached the Eastern Conference final under Tortorella in 2012 – something they've also done in Vigneault's first two seasons behind the bench – losing to the Devils in six games.\nOther than Lundqvist, captain Ryan McDonagh, defensemen Marc Staal and Dan Girardi, centers Derek Stepan and Derick Brassard, left wings Rick Nash, Chris Kreider and J.T. Miller and right wing Mats Zuccarello are the current Rangers who played for Tortorella.\n\"He was a big part of my first few years in the NHL,\" Staal said. \"He definitely had a lot to do with my development as a player. It was only a matter of time before he got another job. He's had a lot of success, he's a good coach. I'm happy for him. It'll be good to compete against him.\"\nThe Blue Jackets were expected to be a much-improved playoff contender this season. Lundqvist believes that could still be the case, recalling how Tortorella took over a struggling Rangers team in February 2009, almost instantly changed the team's culture and led it to a postseason berth.\n\"I think it was inspiring and refreshing to see a new coaching staff,\" Lundqvist said. \"When he came in, it was just a different style of coaching and it was fun to play under that.\"\nBRIEFS: Tonight's game marks Keith Yandle's first against his former team after the Rangers acquired the veteran defenseman on March 1 for a package that included a first-round pick and top prospect Anthony Duclair, who leads the Coyotes with five goals. \"My emotions right now are I don't have too many,\" said Yandle, who spent seven-plus seasons with the Coyotes. \"It might be different [tonight], seeing the guys on the ice. Right now, I'm just getting ready for another game. …\" Veteran fourth-liner Tanner Glass cleared waivers and was re-assigned to Hartford (AHL). The Rangers retain $500,000 of his $1.45 million annual average salary – his deal has one season remaining – and have approximately $1.1 million in salary cap space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:00:59.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
