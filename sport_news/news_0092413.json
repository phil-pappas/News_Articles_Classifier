With a 10-yard touchdown run by Clemson third-string quarterback Kelly Bryant with 8:50 left, the Tigers passed that 56-point threshold and earned a spot in the Hurricanes' record book. \n\"Very disappointing. Very disappointing loss. We don't come out there expecting that type of result and we've just got to work better, do better,\" Miami safety Deon Bush said. \n\"It hurts. It hurts. It hurts a lot. But me being an older leader on this team, I can't really dwell on it. I've got to try and rally the guys up. I've got to try and get them pumped up. We've still got five games left. Even though the scoreboard didn't look like we wanted it to look, we've got to bounce back. That's just the name of the game. We've got to bounce back.\" \nClemson routs Miami at Sun Life Stadium. (Michael Laughlin) \nIt was also the Hurricanes' first shutout loss at home since their 48-0 loss to Virginia on Nov. 10th, 2007, the night Miami played its final home game at the Orange Bowl. \nThat loss has stung for years and the sentiments from fans and former players that night seemingly matched the frustration that was visible from the first quarter when boos rained down and multiple chants for the firing of Miami coach Al Golden could be heard as the Hurricanes' offense sputtered and their defense had no answers for Clemson, which scored on its first five possessions. \nAdding to the overall ugliness on the day was the early second-quarter hit from Clemson's Shaq Lawson that landed squarely on Brad Kaaya's chest and knocked the quarterback out of the game after WQAM reported he failed a concussion test on the sideline. Golden: 'we got beat from top to bottom' \nMiami suffers worst loss in school history \nMiami suffers worst loss in school history See more videos \nKaaya, who entered the game as the ACC's passing leader with 1,795 yards did not return, and his status for next week's game at Duke is unclear. He finished the day 6-of-10 for 51 yards with an interception â€” only his second of the season and his fifth in his last 431 attempts. \n\"It's hard. Brad is one of my best friends. He's one of the guys I'm closest to. We live together, we spend time together on film study and to see your best friend go down the way he did, it hurt,\" said reserve quarterback Malik Rosier, who came into the game as Kaaya's replacement. \n\"It's one of those things that mentally, I had to prepare for but emotionally too. It hurt me to see Brad go down.\" \nBut even by the time Kaaya was sent to the locker room, the Hurricanes (4-3, 1-2) were in trouble. \nAt that point, they already faced a three-touchdown deficit fueled by preseason ACC Player of the Year Deshaun Watson, the Clemson quarterback who used both his legs and his arm to lead the Tigers down the field nearly at will during the first half. \nOn Clemson's first drive, Watson completed a 34-yard touchdown drive to Jordan Leggett for the first score. On the second, he used a 63 yard run to push the Tigers into Miami territory and set up a 5-yard touchdown run from Wayne Gallman. And on the third drive, he rushed for three yards to gain a first down and extend a drive that culminated with Zac Brook's 1-yard touchdown run. \nAnd the Hurricanes couldn't answer. \nInstead, Miami racked up penalty after penalty, turned the ball over and ultimately, was left scrambling as players including Kaaya and leading receiver Rashawn Scott got hurt on what turned out to be a dark afternoon at Sun Life Stadium. \nWatson, a sophomore, finished 15-of-19 for 143 yards with one touchdown and rushed eight times for 98 yards while Gallman had 22 carries for 118 yards. \nIn all, the Tigers (7-0, 4-0) outgained Miami 567-146, held the Hurricanes to just six first downs and 53 rushing yards and scored 21 points off Miami turnovers. \n\"We got beat from top to bottom. They outplayed us, they outcoached us. I just told the team that's completely my responsibility for not getting them ready to play,\" Golden said. \"They just beat us soundly, in every facet of the game, period.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:59:00.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
