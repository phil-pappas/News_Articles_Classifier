He missed forcing a playoff by two strokes that day, which ended his season in a disappointing fashion after he tied for 74th at the Class 3A state tournament as a sophomore.\n\"I would have liked to finish it off at state and be competitive there, but you've got to take learning experiences away from it,\" Le Vine said. \"I feel confident this year, and super excited to try to get to state again.\"\nLe Vine's continued development has been evident this season. He's been the Wolves' clear-cut No. 1 golfer. His play has been especially vital to Niles West's team success in dual meets, including victories over Waukegan and Notre Dame. He was 3-under par against the Bulldogs, and 2-under against the Dons.\nLe Vine likely won't have to shoot par, or under par, in order to make it back downstate. He will likely have to avoid double bogeys or worse, however.\n\"I've managed the course better [this year],\" Le Vine said. \"I've had some struggles with my swing, but I feel like I'm getting it together. I feel like my bad rounds aren't as bad right now. I've always been a great putter, but I've improved a lot on that. I feel like I could lean on that, on my short game and putting, if something ever goes wrong.\"\nLe Vine shot an 83 on a cold, windy day at the New Trier Invitational on Saturday, Oct. 3. Junior Jake Peiser finished with a 91 and the Wolves shot a 363 as a team. The Wolves took 16th in the 16-team field.\nNiles West was scheduled to compete in the New Trier Regional on Tuesday, Oct. 6, and any Wolves who advance will play in the Conant Sectional on Monday, Oct. 12.\nEvanston\nThe New Trier Invitational at Winnetka Golf Club was Evanston's final meet of the regular season. For senior Nick Lydon, it was a chance to prepare for the Class 3A New Trier Regional, which was scheduled to take place at the same course on Tuesday, Oct. 6.\nEven though he said he's struggled in the final month of the regular season, Lydon said that he wanted to get a feel for the course in the hope that he can advance to the sectional like he did in 2014.\nHis round on Saturday, Oct. 3, was full of useful information.\n\"It's good to know what clubs I want to hit off of the tee,\" Lydon said. \"That's probably the biggest thing, honestly. And then where to put the ball on the greens. And how the greens are rolling.\"\nA key to Lydon's postseason success, he said, will likely be to put the ball in the fairway off the tee.\n\"That's how I'm going to [play well] â€” just stay away from double and triple bogeys,\" Lydon said.\nLydon shot a team-best 89 at the New Trier Invitational. Sophomore Matthew Barbato and senior Dylan Thompson finished with rounds of 90. Junior Daniel Nortz carded a 92. Evanston finished 15th with a 361.\nMaine South\nWhile the New Trier Invitational at Winnetka Golf Club was a chance for several teams to prepare for the Class 3A New Trier Regional, it was senior Tyler Guest's opportunity to experience what it is like to be Maine South's No. 1 golfer.\nSenior Tim Zelek and sophomore Michael George were both at Old Orchard Country Club on Saturday, Oct. 3, Guest said, preparing for the Class 3A Hersey Regional on Tuesday, Oct. 6. Guest, who said he's very familiar with Old Orchard, slid into the No. 1 spot.\n\"I kind of like it,\" Guest said of playing No. 1. \"You know that you have to try your best and post a good score for your team and kind of lead the team. It was fun.\"\nGuest shot a team-best 83 in cold, windy conditions. He also fought through fatigue that stemmed from the previous night, when he watched Maine South's football team overcome a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat Glenbrook South 34-31 in overtime.\n\"[The comeback] was awesome,\" Guest said.\nSophomore Brendan Ahlbeck shot an 87 at the New Trier Invitational. Sophomore Joe Tonioni finished with an 88 for the Hawks, who shot 348 (10th place). Junior Joey Rogowski contributed a 90 to the team score.\nEric Van Dril is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.\nTwitter: @VanDrilSports\n Golf Evanston Niles Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5613f5fb/turbine/ct-prh-maine-south-niles-west-evanston-boys-golf-tl-1008-20151006"], "published": "2015-10-06T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:23:49.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
