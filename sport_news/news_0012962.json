Image 8 of 8 Cavanaugh delivers big for Shen 1 / 8 Back to Gallery Clifton Park\nMeghan Cavanaugh walked to the sideline like someone who had just been released from a meat locker. Her body petrified after a third gruesome fall, all the muddied Shenendehowa standout could mutter was \"everything\" when asked by a coach what was hurting.\nFunny, though, how that was also the answer to what she meant to her team in a critical 3-2 win Tuesday against Niskayuna. She notably had two goals amid twice as many hard spills.\n\"They were all ugly fouls. None of them were intentional, I don't think,\" Niskayuna coach Bryce Colby said. \"It's just, she went down hard three or four times. All I said (afterward) was, 'I swear we weren't out to get you. It just looked that way.'\"\nSeveral of the opposing players are club-level friends. Three left a postgame chat with Cavanaugh, one whispering she couldn't believe how Cavanaugh was \"wrecked.\" There wasn't an ounce of delight in her voice.\nAlas, Niskayuna knew the truth anyway.\n\"Meghan was a killer tonight,\" Colby said.\nThe senior midfielder scored the first and third goals in wicked-fast time to set up an opportunity Thursday at Saratoga for the Suburban Council 's vaunted Blue Division title. Arguably the league's best player, she rose to the occasion, giving enough of herself that Shen could survive the final nine minutes with her tucked by the team bench trying to hit the reboot button.\nIt's amazing the Silver Warriors could ever find theirs after a rough start.\nShen's often-discussed plan was to produce two goals in the opening 10 minutes. It finally happened shortly after a juiced-up 7 p.m. start that featured a higher-profile setting with a live national anthem singer and PA announcer, color game programs and ticket sales.\nCavanaugh struck just 2:32 after the opening touch, after a pretty give-and-go with Ava Sullivan .\nKendra Harbinger followed up about five minutes later after a Sullivan shot slipped out of the goalie's hands (a logical problem on such a wet night).\nIt was a tough start for netminders. Counterpart Jill Shippee and Shen had only given up a couple of two-goal games. Nisky had a pair in about two mid-first half minutes.\nHannah Munro 's 35-yard free kick had a \"bottom that never dropped out,\" as Colby put it.\nMarika Contompasis (the Suburban Council's top scorer this year) followed up by flicking a free kick with her head — with her back toward the goal — for a tie with 24 minutes left.\n\"We knew it was going to be that kind of battle,\" Shen coach Holli Mulholland said.\nNiskayuna had its own health issues. One player appeared to have broken a wrist. Two others were battling nausea.\nCavanaugh had plenty of life in her legs just 59 seconds into the second half after an early corner kick. She swarmed to the goal line and punched one in.\n\"Their speed was all over the place. Especially early in the game, we had a tough time dealing with the spaces up front,\" Colby said.\nHe thought Niskayuna's best play came in the last 20 minutes. But Shippee made some earned saves. Shen teammates and coaches regarded Emma Smith for the defensive work she did on Contompasis.\n\"We've just got to recover,\" Colby said.\nShen improved to 12-0-1 in league games. Niskayuna fell to 11-1-1. Shen will play at Saratoga in the final regular-season Suburban game Thursday looking to wrap up a title.\nIt's outright with a win or tie, after Shaker (which scoreless tied Shen last week) fell at Saratoga on Thursday night, 3-2.\nCavanaugh needs to recover, too. She wasn't sure about returning, if the game had 20 minutes of overtime.\n\"I want to say, yeah, but I don't know actually. It was three consistent hits. My foot was hurting so bad (in part from a damaged toenail) and the last hit came on the outside of my knee. I just cramped up.\"\nTeammates continued to ask how she felt in the closing minutes. Cavanaugh smiled and offered quick instructions and encouragement. She didn't pay too much attention to the clock. Belief is a great pain reliever.\n\"I had full confidence in our team,\" Cavanaugh said. \"I'm a part of the team, but they can still hold their ground.\"\nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787484/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787484/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787485/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787482/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787482/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787486/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787480/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787483/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787485/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787484/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787486/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787483/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787480/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787481/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787480/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787481/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787483/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787485/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787482/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787486/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/30/8787481/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:18:50.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
