After the long, hot summer, you feel like celebrating fall’s arrival and there is no better way than with the use of pumpkins in your landscape decorating. The feeling of fall and festivals is in the air and one of the best ways to celebrate and get tips on decorating with pumpkins is to take a stroll through the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens on Oct. 23-24 at the Autumn Gardenfest.\nYou’ll get tips as you are strolling along the beautiful cucurbit displays seen in the Crape Myrtle Allee. You will want to be sure to stop for pictures here. Then walk on over and look at the pumpkins in the Mediterranean Garden, where they stand so picturesque against the giant blue agave and the Mexican bush sage in full bloom. Pay attention to the dozens of yellow sulphur butterflies flying all around as if they are celebrating the season.\nThe Autumn Gardenfest has been designed with the whole family in mind. On the Great Lawn behind the new Andrews Visitor and Education Center will be a children’s pumpkin maze, bounce house, story time at the water garden and a ride on the Bamboo Express.\nOn the lawn in front of the Pavilion you will find vendors selling plants. There will be those hard to find trees, roses, flowers, bulbs, daylilies, irises and, of course, pumpkins too. There will be food and refreshments making sure you’ll want to stay all day.\nActually you will want to partake both days of the festival as there is a once in a lifetime opportunity to hear some of the most well-known garden speakers in the country. The programs will be located in the Andrews Visitor and Education Center and begin at 1 p.m. on Friday.\nOct. 23\n• 1 p.m. Joan Calder: Pollinators in the Garden — You Are Their Heroes\nConserving habitats for pollinators like bees and butterflies is not only critical but it can become a fun hobby that is sure to develop into a passion.

It doesn’t matter if your garden grows symmetrical green bumps or features funky, found objects, it is your garden. Recognizing your own style helps create a garden that is cohesive and distinctive. If you are just starting out, the opportunities are endless, and that can be a blessing and a curse. If your garden is established, push through the inertia to recapture that thrill of something new. We’ll talk about the possibilities.\n• 3 p.m. Norman Winter: Blooms, Birds & Butterflies\nNorman Winter, director of the University of Georgia’s Coastal Georgia\nBotanical Gardens and Savannah Morning News’ Garden Guru will show you how to have dazzling blooms that will bring in bees, butterflies and hummingbirds for a summer long season of excitement.

Whether it is a delight to the eye, unexpected humor or a tug on the heartstrings, garden surprises transform a garden walk into an experience, and therefore, a memory. Carefully composed plantings, over-achieving plants and creative garden ornament can each provide a “wow” moment. Askey will share some of her favorite “wows” from more than three decades of travel as a garden journalist with the hope of sending us home to create a little “wow” in our own gardens.\n• 11:30 a.m. Diana Churchill: The Lowcountry’s Top Ten Winter Bird Celebrities\nDiana Churchill, the Savannah Morning News’ Birder’s Eye View columnist, will be quick to tell you the Lowcountry is a treasure trove when it comes to birding.
