Diomansy Kamara headed a ball for Francis Dadzie, who cut inside and shot from just outside the box but his effort missed the target by a whisker.\nChennaiyin did not take too much time to settle down with Fikru Teferra and Jayesh Rane having good chances to give their team the lead.\nNorthEast United had a chance to go ahead in the 38th minute when they were awarded a penalty. A corner kick saw Alessandro Potenza pull down Cedric Hengbart and referee pointed to the spot. Senegalese striker Kamara stepped up to take the spot kick but rival custodian Edel Bete guessed correctly and saved the shot.\nThere was more drama after the penalty save as Khabra was issued the marching orders for aggressive behaviour.\nIn the second session, both teams made influential changes in an attempt to gain control. While the visitors introduced Elano and Mendoza, NorthEast United fielded Argentine attacker Velez and marquee player Sabrosa.\nNorthEast went close in the 65th minute when Dadzie laid the ball for Boithang Haokip who sensed an opportunity from inside the box but his shot was wide of the mark.\nAt the other end, Mendoza beat his marker and then hoodwinked another one but his final attempt ballooned over the bar.\nJust when the match seemed like heading for a draw,the hosts won a penalty in the 89th minute after Jayesh Rane clattered into Sabrosa inside the danger zone. Sabrosa made no mistake from the spot.\nIn added time, NorthEast made it 2-0 thanks to a lightning counter attack from which Velez scored without much trouble past the onrushing Bete.\nThe match, which saw one red and 10 yellow cards being  shown by the referee, witnessed many heated moments, with the  players almost exchanging blows at times. Chennaiyin played  with 10 men from the 40th minute onwards after Harmanjot  Khabra was given a straight red card by the referee for  violent conduct. \nBefore the half time, NorthEast head coach Cesar Farias  and his Chennaiyin counterpart Marco Materazzi exchanged  heated words from their respective touchlines. This brought  players and officials from both sides face-to-face and on the  verge of exchanging blows and the match was interrupted for  about five minutes. \nThe visiting team's captain Bernard Mendy chased Farias  and he had to be stopped physically by other players and the  referee. \nAfter the referee blew the final whistle, Mendy again  chased Farias and this time the players of both the sides were  involved in a scuffle. The referee had to intervene and  security officials prevented the situation from worsening  further in front of the nearly 20,000 crowd at the Indira  Gandhi Stadium. \nIn the 77th minute, NorthEast United's Sabrosa and  Chennaiyin's Mehrajuddin Wadoo got involved in a face-off and  both were shown the yellow cards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:28:42.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
