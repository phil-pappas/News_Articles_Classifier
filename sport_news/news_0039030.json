(Photo: RipTide Bait and Tackle, Brigantine NJ) \nBlack sea bass season has finally reopened and will continue until Dec. 31, now reinstituted with a 15-fish bag limit and 12.5-inch minimum size. All indicators point to some excellent sea bass fishing ahead of us and anglers have been chomping at the bit to get back at the sea biscuits. \nLook to target water depths in the 100- to 180-foot range right now for your best shot at sea bass. Striped bass continue to show up in greater numbers day by day and blackfishing is off the hook, even though right now you can only keep one fish until Nov. 16 when the limit jumps back up to a six-fish bag. \nEarlier this week, I hopped on a party boat trip on the Dauntless out of Point Pleasant, and we dropped anchor on the Shark River Reef in 140 feet of water to enjoy some of the best porgy action I have ever encountered in Jersey, with a cooler full of 2- to 4-pound ”pork chop” size porgies by the end of the day. \nBut that’s not the real story. As soon as our clam baits got to the sea floor they were immediately gobbled up by keeper-size sea bass. There were so many sea bass around I actually had to change up my rig within 20 minutes of fishing to smaller hooks so as to avoid reeling in double header sea bass after each drop. \nthere are a lot of pinfish around in the surf now, and guys are catching them and keeping them alive for fall striper baits. (Photo: Wiki) \nSome knucklehead caliber bass up to 5 pounds were also reeled up and released. If that drop and reel action is any indicator of what could be happening, get ready to load the cooler this weekend. Rig up with a hi-lo dropper rig, fixed with size 2/0 Gamakatsu Octopus hooks or 3/0 Baitholder hooks and tip the hooks with fresh clam baits. \n“Some keeper striped bass were caught this week, especially off the surf around the North End and around the 9th Street Bridge,” said John Gryzmko of Fin-Atics, Ocean City. “The surf guys were getting bass on SP Minnows and it was a mid-day, top-of-the-tide type of bite where the bridge guys were tossing 4-inch rubber baits and small swimming plugs around the pilings during the night hours.” \nBlackfishing is really heating up at the Longport Pier and Beer Pier with green crabs and clams scoring tog around the slack high tides. The most interesting report from Gryzmko came in the form of false albacore along the beachfront. “A whale was feeding on the rainfish schools right close to the surf around the South End and albies were all around it. Guys were casting Deadly Dicks and tying into albies right in the wash. Boat guys had them too.” Let’s hope those albies stick around for some light tackle drag peeling fun. FISHING: Sorry Charlie, it’s primetime for tuna \n“There’s been some more bass around,” according to Andy Grossman at Riptide Bait and Tackle in Brigantine. “The back bay has been producing a few keeper bass for Joe Rogers, who was dropping live eels in Eagle Bay to land seven fish. He was fishing pretty shallow, about 4 feet, and the cuts along the sodbanks to find those fish.” \nBass are also showing up on the North End surf as Paul Lavigna plugged up a keeper and a short, while Joe Connolly broke the bank and rung up a huge 33.5-pound cow striper caught on a bunker head near the same area. \nBluefish of 1 to 2 pounds are chomping on cut mullet on fireball rigs while Grossman also mentioned that there are a lot of pinfish around in the surf now, and guys are catching them and keeping them alive for fall striper baits. \n“Tog are starting to show up on the inshore rockpiles,” said Matt Slobodjian, Jim’s Bait and Tackle, Cape May. “There are a lot of small fish but we've also seen fish to 8 pounds coming in.” Carl Hampton of Newtown Square, Pa., weighed in a 7.69-pound blackfish caught on the rocks at Hereford Inlet. New bill proclaims striped bass as America's National Fish \nRounding out the surf mix is a bunch of kingfish and a few keeper class bass. Added Slobodjian, “We haven't heard of any bass in the Rips or in the Delaware Bay other than resident fish, but not many guys tried it this week.” \nCanyon tuna fishing is still firing on all cylinders as John Chadrow proved bringing in three yellowfin and a pile of dolphin from the Wilmington Canyon. However, the northernmost Hudson Canyon has been the center for extremely hot tuna activity if you can make the long run from southern ports. \nSend your reports in to me this week if you make it out, we want to hear from you. \nReach Nick Honachefsky at beachnut 33 @ hotmail.com Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1RYJOJ7 Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:53:27.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
