In a similar case detected in an American doctor, Ebola was found in his left eye months after he recovered.\nCafferkey was flown to London early Friday from Scotland, where she lives.\nMedical authorities say the risk of Cafferkey transmitting the virus is low, but public health officials in Scotland are monitoring people with whom she had close contact. Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with blood or body fluids.\nCafferkey was diagnosed with Ebola in December after returning from Sierra Leone. She was treated at the Royal Free for several weeks and discharged in January.\nCafferkey was honored at the Pride of Britain Awards in London last month and met with Prime Minister David Cameron's wife, Samantha, at 10 Downing St.\nThe prime minister tweeted that he wished Cafferkey \"a quick recovery.\"\nSince Ebola broke out in Guinea's forest region last year, it has killed more than 11,200 people in West Africa.\nExperts say there is mounting evidence that the mental and physical health problems in Ebola survivors can last for years after the virus is cleared from the bloodstream. There are thousands of Ebola survivors in West Africa suffering from long-term side effects of the disease, many of whom have no access to treatment.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:16:45.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
