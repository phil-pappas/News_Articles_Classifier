Despite both sides creating a number of chances in the first half, both defensive lines held firm and Australia went to the break 1-0 up. \nThe goal drought broke in the final quarter with both sides finding the back of the net. \nAustralia were first to score with Craig Thomas making it 2-0 four minutes into the final spell. Hugo Inglis pulled one back for the Kiwis four minutes later, but any thoughts of a Kiwi comeback were squashed when Glenn Turner scored for the Aussies to make it 3-1. \nEarlier in the day, it was the Australian women who ran up a big score when they outclassed Samoa 25-0. \nAfter sitting out the first day of the competition, the Australians brushed off the cobwebs and hit their straps to lead 7-0 after the first quarter. By halftime, they had added another three goals, with eight coming in the third quarter and seven more in the final period. \nEmily Smith led the scoring for the Australians with four goals, with three players - Brooke Peris, Jodie Kenny and Ashleigh Nelson - all scoring three. Laura Barden, Madison Fitzpatrick and Jane-Anne Claxton all bagged two, with the other goals going to Anna Flanagan, Marri McMahon, captain Madonna Blyth, Stephanie Kershaw, Georgina Morgan and Mariah Williams. \nIt was the second drubbing for the Samoans after losing their first game 31-0 to New Zealand. Ad Feedback \nThe news for the Samoan men's team was no better - they were beaten 22-0 by Fiji. \nFive goals in the final quarter by Leevan Dutta giving him eight for the match and a double by Jerome Edwards saw the score balloon out from 15-0 to 22-0. Adrian Smith finished with four goals with James Saqacala and Martin Fong both scoring two. The other scorers were Amenatava Veitamana and Alsace Smith. \nFriday is a rest day, with the feature match on Saturday being the transtasman women's clash between the Black Sticks and Australia.
