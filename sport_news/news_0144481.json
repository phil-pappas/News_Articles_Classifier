The duo won two matches to qualify to the district tournament. \nThey will be joined by teammates Emmi Bowers and Andrea Nearhood. \n“I was excited to play with her,” Kardotzke said. “We play well together and I love playing with her. We have great chemistry. She’s one of my best friends. Playing with her is so much fun. We work well together.” \nLaconis and Kardotzke lost only two games Thursday. \n“Perkins has a talented team,” Kardotzke said. “Beating them was something we wanted to accomplish. We thought they’d be competition for districts. Once we got past our first match, things were smooth.” \nNearhood and Bowers lost only one game Thursday. \n“We played Port Clinton’s second-doubles before,” Nearhood said of Hannah Roberts and Lauren Steyer. “We gave them three games last time. We improved and didn’t give them any games at all. \n“(Port Clinton is) a good team. We keep seeing them. We want to make sue to execute and get things done each time.” \nBowers and Nearhood were also sectional champions last season. Nearhood qualified to districts at singles as a sophomore. \n“We want to do the same thing as last year and win sectionals,” Nearhood said, “but we’ll take it one match at a time.” \nBowers and Nearhood, the top seed, play Priscilla Nguyen and Karina Haycook of Perkins in the semifinals Saturday at Clyde. The remainder of the tournament determines district seeding. \nLaconis and Kardotzke, the third seed, play second-seed Taylor Steyer and Meghan Gallogly of Port Clinton in the semifinals. \nBellevue’s Elizabeth Harper and Jena Weider won the first set before falling to Nguyen and Haycook in the final match contested. St. Joseph Central Catholic’s Lillian Cool won two matches. \nClyde’s Beatriz Ytuarte-Orantes and Marissa Gill won two matches apiece. Maddie St. Marie won one. \nBellevue’s Bernadette Wolfe won one match. Oak Harbor’s Addison Hasselbach, and Paige Priesman and Kelsey Bodnar won one match.
