Ryan Divish, The Seattle Times Advertisement SEATTLE — The Mariners have settled on their manager for the 2016 season and beyond. The Los Angeles Times reported this morning that Scott Servais has accepted the Mariners’ offer to replace Lloyd McClendon as the team’s manager. The Times also reported that Tim Bogar, who also interviewed for the managerial position, will serve as bench coach. Multiple baseball sources have confirmed the report. The Mariners will make a formal announcement this afternoon. Both Servais and Bogar are close with new Mariners’ general manager Jerry Dipoto, serving as his assistants in Anaheim last season. Dipoto and Servais played together with the Rockies in 2000. That prior relationship seems to be important for Dipoto, who at times clashed with manager Mike Scioscia during his time in Anaheim. Disagreements over philosophies about advanced analytics led to a final power struggle between the two men with owner Arte Moreno ultimately taking Scioscia’s side. Dipoto resigned in July. “The best marriages are those in which you fall in love and then get married, rather than someone arranging it from 1,000 miles away,” Dipoto said at his hiring press conference. Dipoto downplayed that experience as his reason not to retain McClendon, but cited philosophical differences about baseball as a reason for a change. Servais will be the Mariners’ seventh full-time manager since their last playoff appearance in 2001. He inherits a veteran team that fell short of lofty expectations this season, finishing 76-86 this past season. Servais has no managerial experience, but had interviewed for the vacant Padres’ managerial job a month ago. He’s worked in the front office for the last seven years. This past season, he worked closely with Dipoto in Anaheim, overseeing scouting and player development while trying to shape the philosophy of the organization. Prior to the Angels, Servais worked for six seasons (2006-2011) as senior director of player development for the Texas Rangers. He was responsible for the on-field development in the minor-league system and worked with the team’s major-league catchers. After deciding not to bring back McClendon, who was under contract, for this season, Dipoto said that finding someone with managerial experience wasn’t a priority in his search. “Baseball experience counts for a lot no matter where they came through,” he said. “I think having a major league background somewhat, whether it be through coaching, managing, playing, etc., is important. I think that lends to credibility in a clubhouse, but other than that it’s gong to be about leadership, about team building, about the ability to inspire an environment.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:40:41.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
