Jonathan Bernier made 13 saves in the loss.\nAthanasiou opened the scoring at 13:50 of the second period, using a burst of speed to split Morgan Rielly and Roman Polak before beating Bernier blocker side for his fourth of the pre-season.\nMantha gave the Red Wings a 2-0 lead with 54-seconds remaining in the second on a power play, beating a sprawling Bernier for his third of the exhibition schedule.\nBoyes got the Maple Leafs on the board 22-seconds into the third â€” beating Mrazek by putting home his own rebound.\nTempers boiled over between the two clubs, who were playing each other on back-to-back nights, in the third period. After Toronto's Richard Panik caught Tyler Bertuzzi with an open-ice hit in the Red Wings zone, Athanasiou delivered a big hit on Peter Holland behind the Leafs' net.\nToronto outshot Detroit 7-5 in the first period including a 5-1 margin at the midway mark.\nFive minutes into the first, Nazem Kadri failed to connect on a 2-on-1 pass from Boyes. Later, Holland put his backhand shot over the net when he was all alone in front of Mrazek.\nKadri had another chance three minutes into the second, but fanned on a one-time attempt from Boyes.\nThe Leafs will have a day off on Sunday before returning to practice on Monday. Toronto opens the regular season at home on Wednesday night when it hosts the Montreal Canadiens.\nNotes: The announced attendance at Air Canada Centre was 17,879. The two clubs played a scoreless mandatory five-minute 3-on-3 overtime period as teams test out the new format.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:05:45.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
