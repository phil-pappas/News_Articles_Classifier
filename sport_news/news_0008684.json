Willis was under duress all day, from the opening snap of the game to his last, and he completed just 39 percent of his passes (12 of 31), threw two interceptions and was sacked twice and hit a ton. \nDespite the beating, Willis' teammates, who spoke on his behalf because KU's freshmen are not made available to the media, came away impressed with the way he fought through it.

He's definitely a confident kid and he'll keep getting better each week.” \nAdded Beaty: “Probably the biggest positive I will take out of this game is the way that young man handled today. As he would come off the field we used every single moment as a teachable moment. He's a freshman. Obviously. And there's a lot of things to learn in hostile territory like today, particularly against a front as good as they were.” Press Conferences & Post-Game Interviews KU coach David Beaty shares prayers for Oklahoma State, disappointment over KU's play \nKU coach David Beaty shares prayers for Oklahoma State, disappointment over KU's play \nWillis' best moments of Saturday came late in the first half, with KU trailing 35-3. On a third-and-eight play from his own 40, Willis evaded the OSU rush, stepped up in the pocket and hit Jeremiah Booker with a 27-yard touch pass for a first down. On the very next play, with the Cowboys on their heels, Willis fired a bullet to Steven Sims Jr., who caught it cleanly and raced 33 yards to the end zone for KU's only touchdown of the day. \n“I loved his demeanor,” Beaty said of Willis. “He kept learning, he kept paying attention.” \n— See what people were saying about the game during KUsports.com's live blog .
