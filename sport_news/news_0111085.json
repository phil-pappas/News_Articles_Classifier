Have we met before? Why yes, we have. When the Victor Blue Devils line up Friday at 7 p.m. to play Webster Thomas in a Section V Class AA football playoff game, the faces and numbers will no doubt be familiar. No. 2 seed Victor (7-0) defeated No. 7 seed Thomas (4-3) by a score of 34-7 in Week 2 of the season. So it stands to reason that the Blue Devils should cruise but as we know with the world of sports, logic and reason can take unexpected holidays. Complacency is one of the biggest fears for coaches as rematches approach, but that really shouldn’t be a concern for the Blue Devils. They’re hungry to defend their Class AA title and they know it won’t be an easy road with potential matchups against Pittsford (7-0) and Aquinas (7-0) on the horizon. To that end, motivation will be easy to come by and the Blue Devils got it done all season with a strong and balanced ground game fueled by Dan Barrow, T.D. Ierlan and QB Jamie Trimboli. All three have rushed for 398 yards or more and two more backs have rushed for 200 or more. Collectively, the Blue Devils have cleared 2,200 yards and are averaging 7.5 yards a rush. Thomas beat Churchville-Chili last week to get the momentum right heading into the playoffs, but consistency has been a problem. Victor, meanwhile, is the poster boy for consistency. The Blue Devils have scored 34 or more points in six of their seven games and have held opponents to just one TD in four games. But the big question mark for Victor is this: How good has the opposition been this season? The combined record for Victor’s opponents is 23-26 and three didn’t even qualify for the postseason. The same could be asked of Webster Thomas because all four of its wins are against teams that are not in the Class AA Tournament. Revenge will no doubt be a factor for the spirited play of Thomas, but will that be enough against a Victor team that seems to do everything so well? Class B No. 8 Midlakes (2-5) at No. 1 Batavia (7-0), 7 p.m. Friday: The Screaming Eagles enter the playoffs on a three-game losing streak, partly due to an offense that struggled in scoring a combined 14 points in the first two games of the skid. Midlakes showed signs of offensive life in scoring 26 points in last weekend’s loss to Dundee, but this week the Screaming Eagles are up against a Batavia defense that’s shut out two of its last four opponents. The bigger issue for Midlakes is its defense, which hasn’t been awful in allowing 26 points per game. But the unit will need to be on point against a Batavia offense that’s putting up 42 points a game. The Blue Devils have multiple threats with senior QB Greg Mruczek leading the way. He completed 9 of 10 passes for 234 yards and 4 TDs against Geneva last week, and senior Ryan Hogan caught six of those passes for 144 yards and three TDs. Senior running back Dominick Mogavero brings balance; he rushed for 116 yards on just six carries last week. No. 7 Palmyra-Macedon (2-5) at No. 2 Livonia (6-1), 7:30 p.m. Friday: Pal-Mac ended its regular season on a positive note, beating Wayne to snap a five-game skid. Junior Brandon Hawkins has been a force and last weekend rushed for 333 yards and three TDs while Andrew Kujawski added 132 rushing yards and a pair of TDs. But even with the win, the Pal-Mac defense has been a bit leaky in surrendering 37 points a game. Livonia is averaging 41 points a game and pretty much gets it done on the ground with an attack that’s as balanced as it gets. Matt Hyde (11 yards), QB Brody Metcalf (31), Ethan Perham (73) and John Smith (57) don’t have individual stats that popped from last week, but combined that’s 172 rushing yards against a stout Le Roy team. Saturday Class D No. 8 Dundee (4-3) at No. 1 Red Jacket (7-0), 1 p.m. Saturday: First-year coach Josh Henninger said back in August that if it ain’t broke, he’s not going to fix it. He stuck to his word, and the running game that helped the Indians win two straight Class D crowns appears to have them on track for a third. Senior Sean Sheets is the undoubted leader as a running back and defensive back, leading the way for a team that pounds the ball without apology. The aggressiveness isn’t just at the skill positions, either, as the blockers pursue their assignments with vigor to set a physical tone. Red Jacket beat Dundee in Week 4, but needed a late TD to get past the season-high 38 points surrendered to the Scotsmen. That was a bit of an anomaly for a team that gave up 13 points in the three games prior, and don’t be fooled by the 28 combined points given up to Marcus Whitman and Mynderse. Those points were scored in in the second half of lopsided games against second and third units. Still, there’s little doubt the Indians remember that Week 4 test in Dundee and there’s even smaller doubt that the Indians will be out to set the record straight. Class A No. 7 Spencerport (3-4) at No. 2 Canandaigua (5-2), 2 p.m. Saturday: The Rangers have lost four of their last five games, one of those a 47-28 decision to the Braves just two weeks ago. The score is a bit deceiving because the game was tied 28-28 after three quarters before the Braves pulled away. QB Mitch Schaefer passed for 253 yards in that game and RB Coron Broomfield ran for 178 yards. But Alton Jones is the Spencerport player the CA defense knows it needs to be aware of. The sophomore got CA for an 81-yard TD run and he’s certainly a handful to contain. Will the Rangers be eager to get back on a winning track? Of course. But they’ll be playing a CA team that’s eager as well, because the Braves ended their regular season last week with a disappointing loss to Irondequoit and they’ll be just as eager to fix what went wrong in that game.
