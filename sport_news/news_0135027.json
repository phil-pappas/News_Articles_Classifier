He just didn’t know he’d be the difference in the game. The all-purpose junior scored all three of GNB Voc-Tech’s touchdowns to lead the Bears to a thrilling 20-19 come-from-behind victory over the Blue Devils at Jeffrey E. Riley Football Stadium in both teams’ first South Coast Conference B Division game. “We had some big plays, they had some too, but we just came out on top,” said Methia. Methia finished with three catches for 110 yards and two touchdowns, in addition to carrying the ball four times for 18 yards and a pick six on defense. “He’s a Fairhaven boy, too,” pointed out GNB Voc-Tech head coach Chuck Allaire. “I’m sure they’re saying, ‘Damn that kid went to Voc-Tech.’ He had a nice game. He’s been playing real well for us.” Senior quarterback Eden Sylvia connected with a streaking Methia in the middle of Fairhaven’s defense for a 25-yard scoring strike to put the Bears on top 20-19 with 2:42 left in the fourth quarter. “(Sylvia) said, ‘I got you.’ I said, ‘Alright, I’ll be there,’” said Methia, recalling his final score of the day. “Noah (Furtado) was on me and I just went up there and got it.” With starting quarterback Ian Furtado on the sideline with an injury, Fairhaven’s offense came up short on its comeback attempt, reaching midfield before backup quarterback John Bulgar was picked off by Sylvia to seal the win for Voc-Tech. “We never put our heads down,” said Sylvia. “We stuck with it and played as a team.” “This was a defensive win,” Allaire said. “We shut them out in the second half. That’s what we needed to do.” After trailing 19-7 at halftime, the Bears kept Fairhaven off the scoreboard in the second half despite the Blue Devils going deep into Voc-Tech territory twice. First, Ian Furtado was picked off at the Bears’ 31, then John Bulgar’s pass attempt fell incomplete on fourth-and-goal from the 11. “We drove and I tried a little play action and we threw a pick instead of keeping it on the ground,” Fairhaven head coach Rudy Bulgar said of Furtado’s second interception of the afternoon. “You control the whole game, but have two costly turnovers.” The Blue Devils out-gained the Bears 332-157 for the game, including a 220-17 advantage in the first half. Methia kept GNB Voc-Tech within striking distance at halftime when he intercepted Ian Furtado in the second quarter and returned it 55 yards to pay dirt. That pulled the Bears within 12-7 with 2:33 left in the second quarter. “I saw it and took it,” said Methia. “I saw the green grass and just went.” Fairhaven answered on its ensuing drive when Ian Furtado hit brother Noah over the middle for a 44-yard touchdown pass to put the Blue Devils up 19-7 as time expired in the first half. Ian Furtado had a huge first half, carrying the ball 12 times for 66 yards and an 11-yard TD run and completing 5-of-8 passes for 84 yards and two more scores. “I thought we moved the ball pretty well,” Rudy Bulgar said. “We had them on the run and we were running the ball well.” After Mike Devlin picked off Ian Furtado on Fairhaven’s first drive of the second half, Methia made the biggest play of the game. Sylvia threw a short pass to senior tight end Cory Barrows, who pitched it to Methia as he scampered past Fairhaven’s defense for an 89-yard score on the hook-and-ladder. It pulled the Bears within five with 3:05 left in the third quarter. “It was designed well and we got caught,” said Rudy Bulgar. “I didn’t think Methia was that fast.” “There was nothing better than that,” said Methia. “It was a great throw by Eden and a good catch by Cory. We went over it a few times in practice. When Cory hits it, I’m turning up and he’s pitching it. It just happened. We put it all together. We knew they were going to bring it on defense so we needed some big plays. That was a great one.” The Bears did a much better job against Ian Furtado in the second half, limiting him to nine yards on eight carries before he went down with an injury midway through the fourth quarter. “When Ian (Furtado) went down, we were scrambling on offense,” Rudy Bulgar said. WHAT IT MEANS: With the win, GNB Voc-Tech is 7-0 in three seasons against SCC B Division teams. … A win over Case next week would put the Bears in position for their third straight B title. … The Blue Devils, who have lost two straight, will try to regroup next week at home against Bourne. SOUTHCOASTVARSITY.COM MVP: Methia scored all three of Voc-Tech’s touchdowns, two on catches and the other on an interception return. METHIA ON BEATING FAIRHAVEN: “No doubt about it, that’s a good football team. This is a big win for us. It’s a playoff win for us.” RUDY BULGAR ON HOLDING VOC-TECH TO 41 RUSHING YARDS: “I think definitely we took away what they wanted to do.” ALLAIRE: “It’s a huge win, a big win. Kids have their homecoming tonight. I told the kids the last thing you want to do is lose your homecoming game and have to go to the dance that night so we pulled it out. Fairhaven is a good football team. They have enough weapons to win a lot of games.” NOTES: After each game, a GNB Voc-Tech player is given the Andrew McCann Award for the best defensive performance. “With three picks, it’s going to be hard for them to decide,” said Methia, cousin of McCann, who died in a 2012 car accident. “We’re just trying to keep his name in the tradition of the school on the football team.”… Miss New Bedford’s Outstanding Teen Meighread Dandeneau, a GNB Voc-Tech senior, sang the National Anthem on Friday night. … Due to lightning, the game was postponed until Saturday and picked up where it left off; Fairhaven had the ball on the Voc-Tech 11, facing a third-and-seven. On the first play Saturday, Ian Furtado was in the end zone on an 11-yard run.
