The players handed themselves over to authorities and have been granted permission to stay in the southern African country temporarily ahead of a court hearing in December. \nThe government of Eritrea, a country of around six million people on the northeast coast of Africa, has been accused by human rights groups of being among the most repressive in the world. The United Nations released a report this year alleging, among other abuses, that forced and prolonged military service was common. \nThe 10 players absconded following Eritrea’s 3-1 loss to Botswana on Oct. 13, which eliminated it from World Cup qualifying. They left their possessions with teammates so as not to raise suspicion, said Joao Salbany, another lawyer representing the players. Salbany said they were concerned with delays by Botswana authorities in providing the players with new clothes and soap to wash with. \nEritrean soccer players have previously used away games to escape their homeland. \nIn 2012, 17 Eritrea players and a team doctor went missing during a tournament in Uganda and eventually applied for asylum. They were later granted asylum in the Netherlands. The entire Eritrean team sought refugee status at the same regional tournament in 2009. \nFour countries have expressed interest in giving these 10 players asylum, their lawyers said.
