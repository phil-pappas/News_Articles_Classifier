The JU defense has seven interceptions (tied for fifth nationally) to go with five fumble recoveries. The 12 turnovers is fourth-most among Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) schools. \nThe aggressive play by JU’s defense is actually a carry-over from the 2014 season when the Dolphins swiped 24 passes to lead the nation. They’ve used the “no-fly zone” as their motto to limit opposing quarterbacks’ success thus far. \nThe defense is a big part of why JU has rolled to a 3-0 start (all road games) heading into the Dolphins’ home opener on Saturday against Pioneer League foe Morehead State. A win against the Eagles would match the best start in JU history, duplicating the 4-0 mark that the 2001 squad compiled before losing five of its last seven games. \nNone of the three wins this season came easy. In each, the defense had to come up with a game-saving stop in the final minutes. JU’s three victories are by six, three and four points. \nCredit a secondary that returned three starters from a year ago. \n“We know each other so well and we’ve got good chemistry in our group,” said safety Terrance Bryant. “We’ve been playing together for so long, we know each other’s tendencies and can play off that. That helps a lot.” \nBryant has been the leader of the group, which includes junior Armani Sampson and senior Dallas Jackson, who both have one interception, and sophomore Brandon Roe. Bryant was credited with 15 tackles and an interception in last week’s victory at Marist and was named the PFL Defensive Player of the Week. The redshirt junior from Fort Walton Beach has put on 30 pounds since arriving at JU and is now one of the team’s most physical players. \n“As a safety, you’re like the last line of defense. You’ve got to be physical and make sure you make that tackle and don’t let them score,” said the 6-2, 205-pound defender who doubles as JU’s punt returner. “I’ve always tried to play with a physical style.’’ \nHe also can force turnovers. JU had seven against Marist, including six interceptions. \n“We do put emphasis on it [interceptions] but it’s a credit to the whole defense,” said defensive coordinator Jake Grande, who is also secondary coach. “You don’t get interceptions unless the D-line is putting pressure on the quarterback. The guys in the secondary have a great understanding of the defense and they can correct their mistake even before we can tell them about it. \n“They all know that when it’s your job to make a play, you make it. They’re harder on themselves than we are on them. They can play fast, fly around and make plays. That’s what this whole unit has been doing since last year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:31:15.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
