Thankfully, in the end, we could score.\" \nCity did create a number of chances but had to rely on their counter-attacking abilities as Sevilla controlled possession. \nThe Spaniards were slick and incisive and claimed a deserved lead through the outstanding Konoplyanka, who had earlier hit the post, after 30 minutes. \nCity levelled six minutes later when Wilfried Bony's shot was deflected in off Rami but Sevilla remained the better side until the hosts' late burst. \nCity looked vulnerable in defence throughout and Pellegrini's decision not to start with captain Vincent Kompany, who only appeared as an injury-time substitute, was a big talking point. \nDespite having recovered from a calf problem, Kompany has been on the bench for the two games since he played for Belgium against Pellegrini's wishes during the recent international break. \nBut having been introduced to great acclaim late on, the skipper could now be back in the starting line-up come Sunday's derby against Manchester United - although there are no guarantees. \nPellegrini said: \"Vincent is just coming back from a long injury that kept him out for a month, and it was probably a risk to give him the responsibility to play in this important game. \n\"Tomorrow we will start thinking about the derby and we will see the way the players recover.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:21:31.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
