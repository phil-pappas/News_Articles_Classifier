(Nikki Boertman/The Commercial Appeal) It took a while, but some good football finally emerged from beneath an avalanche of penalty flags Thursday at Melrose.\nAnthony Foster passed for 175 yards and three touchdowns as Carver won its sixth straight game and put itself in pole position for the Region 8-1A regular-season championship, beating KIPP Academy 28-6.\nThe game was billed as a matchup between KIPP coach Tim Thompson and his former star quarterback at Melrose, Carver offensive coordinator Cedrick Wilson. But it was the Cobras who had most of the highlights, thanks in large part to Foster.\n\"I wanted him to put him in situations and challenge him to make some throws to beat us, and he did,\" said Thompson. \"Hats off to them; they're a great team ... we'll see them again.\"\nKIPP (4-2, 1-1) committed 18 penalties for 140 yards while the Cobras (6-1, 4-0) were flagged 13 times for 85. There were penalties on the first four plays from scrimmage — three offsides against KIPP and a false start for Carver.\n\"I think we just had to settle down,\" said Carver coach Joe Harris. \"There was a lot of excitement about the matchup (between Wilson and Thompson). But we just put it in Foster's hands. He hasn't missed a practice in the two years I've had him.\n\"He's a great kid and a great leader, and he'll play at the next level.\"\nFoster opened the scoring early in the second quarter with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Lareco Wilson to make it 8-0.\nThen after Dewayne Betts responded with a 36-yard laser to Orreon Finley to make it 8-6, Foster found his favorite target, Roderious Foster, for an 11-yard score. The two teamed up on a 27-yard play just before halftime that made it 20-6.\nA 34-yard run by Jason Harris and a 26-yard Foster-to-Sanders hook-up set up a 1-yard sneak by Foster that made it 28-6 late in the third.\nAs impressive as Foster's performance was, though, Harris reserved special praise for his defense, which has held four of its six opponents to a touchdown or less.\n\"We've been scoring 40 points every week, but tonight it was the defense,\" said Harris. \"They really came through.\"\nKIPP's Eric Thomas — who was crowned homecoming king at halftime — ran for 157 yards on 18 carries.\nIN SOCCER\nHouston, the top team in The Commercial Appeal's Super Six, improved to 14-0 on the season with a 10-0 victory over Southwind. Kelly Gallagher had two goals and an assist to pace the attack. ... Briarcrest standout Alyssa Neuberger scored five goals for the second consecutive match as the Saints defeated White Station 8-1 to improve to 12-2-1. ... St. George's (6-5-4) defeated Germantown 3-1 behind goals from Sydney Spadafora, Isabel Correia and Courtney Miller.", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*132/365794.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/365794.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/331172.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*134/795974.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/467734.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*142/331172.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/795974.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*144/467734.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:42:40.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
