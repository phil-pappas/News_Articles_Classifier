Offensive coordinator Clay Helton was appointed interim coach. \nThe school hasn't been specific about Sarkisian's problems, but the second-year coach had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated while giving a speech. \nSarkisian went 12-6 at USC, where he was an assistant coach under Pete Carroll with the program's dominant teams of the past decade. He spent five years as Washington's head coach until 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:44:31.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
