How will the Eagles offense do? Early Birds: Eagles-Saints predictions Al Bello/Getty Images file photo Travel Deals Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015, 1:57 PM \n1. How will the Eagles offense do? \nJeff McLane: As much as the Eagles need to get their run game going, they shouldn’t wait almost two quarters before attacking the Saints’ pass defense. That’s how long it took before Sam Bradford attempted a pass beyond 20 yards last week against the Redskins. The Saints are vulnerable on the back end. Cornerback Brandon Browner has struggled in Rob Ryan ’s junkyard defense and the safety play hasn’t been consistent. Kenny Phillips was released this week. Jairus Byrd has been injured, but is expected to play. The Saints’ pass rush hasn’t helped. Aside from defensive end Cameron Jordan and linebacker Hau’oli Kikaha , no one has regularly gotten pressure on the quarterback. Jordan lines up on both sides. The Eagles could be without left tackle Jason Peters . Matt Tobin did fine in pass protection against the Redskins. Right tackle Lane Johnson is expected to play hurt (knee/ankle). Johnson and right guard Dennis Kelly had trouble with stunts last week. Bradford has the ability to take shots downfield . Chip Kelly can’t be conservative again. \nZach Berman: The offensive line will have all five starters on the field with both Jason Peters and Johnson playing through injuries. They need to remain healthy throughout the game, because the Eagles don’t have much depth at tackle. Bradford has an opportunity for his second consecutive encouraging performance on Sunday. Opposing quarterbacks have a 116.3 rating against the Saints – the best in the NFL. They allow 258 passing yards per game and have surrendered seven passing touchdowns without an interception. The 9.8 yards per attempt are also the most in the league because the Saints have allowed six passing plays of 40+yards, also the most in the league. I bring those numbers up because the Eagles need to show that vertical passing game on Sunday. But the variable is the impact Keenan Lewis could while easing back into the lineup from a sports hernia injury, as well as Byrd. The Saints’ secondary is getting healthier, but it could still be an advantageous matchup for the Eagles’ passing offense. The Saints also allow 123.3 rushing yards per game, so there isn’t an excuse not to run against the Saints, either. The key for the Eagles is sustaining drives. They are the second-to-worst team in the NFL on third-down conversions, and there won’t be opportunities to pass or run if they’re forced to punt. The play total is too low right now – the Eagles need to be in the 70s to win this game. They’re averaging only 60.25 plays this season. \n2. How will the defense do? \nMcLane: Drew Brees , of course, is still running the show, but the Saints offense is a different animal without tight end Jimmy Graham (traded to the Seahawks this offseason). Marques Colston is still hanging around. Brandin Cooks is a shifty pass-catcher underneath. Willie Snead can stretch the field. And C.J. Spiller is always a threat to take one to the house (see: the overtime win over the Cowboys). But the Saints’ passing attack isn’t as fearsome. The Eagles defense has had trouble generating a consistent pass rush. They’ve faced two quick-releasing quarterbacks the last two games and Brees slings it as fast as anyone. The Saints should struggle to get a ground game going against the Eagles’ two gappers. If Bill Davis ’ unit can force the Saints into second and third down and long, it could be a long day for Brees. \nZach Berman: The Eagles will be more prepared for New Orleans’ rushing offense on Sunday than they were when the Saints last visited, which was the fourth highest rushing output by an opponent since Davis came to Philadelphia. The Saints average only 82.5 rushing yards per game, but Mark Ingram , Khiry Robinson , and Spiller form a talented trio. The Saints are no longer tight end-centric passing game without Graham, although Brees is so good at knowing where to go with the ball. He was impressive against the Cowboys (33 of 41, 359 yards, 2 TDs, 0 INTs) in his first game back from injury. Snead has impressed through four games, but Cooks is the player to watch. The Eagles haven’t need to cover a player like him yet this season. He’s a different kind of challenge for Byron Maxwell , who has played against more bigger wide receivers during the first quarter of the season. And the Eagles must account for Spiller out of the backfield – whether it’s a safety or an inside cornerback, who is dangerous with a ball in his hand. If he’s lined up against a linebacker, it’s the same mismatch the Eagles like with Darren Sproles. \n3. Who’s a player to watch? \nMcLane: How about two former Saints – Malcolm Jenkins and Darren Sproles -- both of whom were in Gold and Black when these two teams last met two years ago? Jenkins left for the Eagles via free agency and Sproles was traded for a fifth-round draft pick (Nice job, Howie Roseman ). Jenkins might be playing his best football this season. The last time he played both safety and in the slot was in 2010 – the only year he earned a Pro Bowl nod. Jenkins knows the Saints offense as well as any defender. Sproles was fairly vocal about his bitterness post-trade. He has nothing to prove, but a long punt return or a big play on offense on Sunday would be another feather in his cap. \nBerman: In pre-game warm-ups, I’m focusing on Caleb Sturgis. And every extra point and field goal, Sturgis will be in the crosshairs. The Eagles’ three losses this season have come by an average of five points. The Saints’ last three games have been decided by fewer than seven points. The kicking game will be important on Sunday. I was surprised the Eagles stayed with Sturgis this week after he missed an extra point and a field goal from 33 yards. He needs to validate Kelly’s decision, because another inconsistent kicking effort would be costly. Saints kicker Zach Hocker has a better track record this season – he’s 7 of 9 – but he also has a blocked extra point and a miss from inside 50 yards and inside 40 yards. The Saints worked out kickers this week, but decided to stick with him. \n4. What’s your prediction? \nMcLane: I’ve been wrong all four weeks. So I can’t claim any prognostic superiority when it comes to predicting outcomes. I don’t think the Eagles as bad as they’ve looked through four games, but at some point in time you are what your record says you are, as Bill Parcells once said. Both the Eagles and Saints have their backs to the wall. I don’t usually factor in those types of motivations, especially when it takes a collective effort or lack thereof. But I do think the Eagles have advantages in their run defense, pass offense and return game. The key, as it’s been all season, will be the performance of the offensive line. If they can just limit the negative-yard carries and give DeMarco Murray , Ryan Matthews and Sproles enough on first down, it should be enough. I’m covering my eyes and picking the Birds. Take it for what it’s worth. Eagles 27, Saints 24 . \nBerman: Both teams are 1-3, so send the desperation story line out the door because both desperate for a win. I like the matchup for the Eagles’ offense, which has been the problem this season. They should play better, and you’d think if they’re improved, the Eagles would win. But Brees on the other sideline should scare the Eagles. Good quarterback have a habit of hurting the Eagles. The question is whether the Eagles can outscore New Orleans, who surrender 26 points per game. I think the Eagles can do so with a consistent passing game. They’re 5.5-point favorites in Las Vegas, which should be encouraging for Eagles fans. It will be closer than the point spread, but I’m going with Eagles 28, Saints 27.
