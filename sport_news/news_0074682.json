(AP) — The New Orleans Saints have brought back wide receiver Joseph Morgan before Thursday night’s home game against the unbeaten Atlanta Falcons. \nMorgan, who spent several weeks on the roster earlier this season, returns on the heels of a Saints loss in Philadelphia during which receiver Marques Colston injured his right shoulder. \nColston has been present at practice this week, but has been listed by the club as not practicing during full-team drills, which are closed to reporters. \nMorgan began his career with New Orleans as an undrafted free agent in 2011, but spent two of his first four seasons on injured reserve and spent only part of the 2014 season with the team. \nIn a corresponding move, New Orleans released reserve defensive back Don Jones. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:13:21.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
