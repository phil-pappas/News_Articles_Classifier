But of course this is not the time for investment.” \nWolfsburg is heavily reliant on main sponsor Volkswagen for backing but the car giant is in crisis after U.S. authorities said it evaded emissions checks on 482,000 vehicles. The company put aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) for recall costs and fines though the real cost is likely to be significantly higher.
