The Cubs won 6-4. By The Associated Press \nCHICAGO — For the Chicago Cubs and their ever-hopeful fans, this bash was a long time in the making. \nKyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez homered and the young Cubs clinched a postseason series at Wrigley Field for the first time ever, beating the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Tuesday to win the NL Division Series in four games. \nOnly once since they last brought home the World Series in 1908 had the Cubs won a playoff series and never before had they finished off the job at their century-plus-old ballpark. \nBut with a raucous, towel-waving crowd jamming the Friendly Confines, the North Siders gave generations of fans exactly what they wanted. \nCloser Hector Rondon struck out Stephen Piscotty on a pitch in the dirt, and catcher Miguel Montero scooped the ball and made the tag to end it. That sent the Cubs streaming out of the dugout to start a wild celebration. \n“They deserve it,” Rizzo said in the middle of the party. “Hopefully, this is just a taste of what’s to come.” \nUp-and-comers all season, first-year manager Joe Maddon’s bunch of wild-card Cubs had arrived. \nThe Cubs are headed to the NL Championship Series for the first time since 2003. They beat Atlanta in the NLDS that year, but then lost in seven games to the Marlins. Chicago dropped those final two at home, including the infamous Bartman defeat in Game 6. \nChicago will face the winner of the Los Angeles Dodgers-New York Mets matchup. The teams are tied at two games apiece. \nNo team was hotter down the stretch than Chicago, which finished third in the majors with 97 wins after five straight losing seasons. \nThe Cubs knocked out the two teams that finished ahead of them in the NL Central, beating Pittsburgh in the wild-card game and sending St. Louis home after it led the majors with 100 wins. \nThe banged-up Cardinals had reached the NLCS in the last four years. \nRizzo’s solo drive to right off losing pitcher Kevin Siegrist in the sixth put Chicago back on top 5-4 after St. Louis scored two in the top half. \nAs if the fans were roaring at the top of their lungs after that home run, they were really screaming after Schwarber’s monstrous shot leading off the seventh. The ball seemed to disappear, possibly clearing the videoboard in right or hitting the Budweiser sign above it. \nThe late drives by Rizzo and Schwarber along with Baez’s three-run homer off John Lackey in the second came after Chicago set a postseason record with six long balls in Monday’s win. \nAnd with the ball flying out again, the Cubs won for the 12th time in 13 games. \nDODGERS 3, METS 1 — At New York, Clayton Kershaw ended his five-game postseason skid with seven brilliant innings while pitching on three days’ rest and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the New York Mets to force a deciding Game 5 in the NL Division series. \nThe series shifts back to Dodger Stadium on Thursday. \nGame 2 winner Zack Greinke will try to lead the Dodgers to a spot in the NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs. Jacob deGrom, who beat Kershaw in Game 1, is set to start for the Mets. \nKershaw gave up one run and three hits. The reigning NL MVP and Cy Young Award winner was 1-6 with a 4.99 ERA for his postseason career entering this start.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:21.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
