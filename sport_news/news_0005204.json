They’re in and we’re excited. Every guy on this team is a huge baseball fan and so we’re ready to roll.”\nRaptors point guard Kyle Lowry and shooting guard DeMar DeRozan were at Rogers for the Jays’ 11-8 win Monday. DeRozan looked at it as a chance to step out of the limelight and watch other athletes perform.\nHe, Lowry and actor Gerard Butler posed for a picture with Jays pitcher Marcus Stroman after the game.\n“Great time, it was an amazing time,” DeRozan said. “It was good to get out there and support our team on the other side, instead of us being on the floor getting the reception from the crowd and just being there.”\nIt’s not often that DeRozan gets a chance to be a face in the crowd. He enjoyed it Monday and was looking forward to heading back Tuesday afternoon.\n“It felt good to sit back and be a fan and not be on this side of it,” he said, standing against the Raptors’ backdrop with cameras in front of him, “and really be on the outside looking in.”\nThe city and the country have grown increasingly passionate about the Jays as they rolled to a 93-win season and into the depths of the team’s first playoff run in 22 years. The extra attention on the Jays hasn’t gone unnoticed. The daily media turnout has been small for the Raptors this month, but they understand why.\n“We went in their locker-room last night and saw all the media lined up down the whole hallway and me and Kyle were amazed off of that. It was a cool thing,” DeRozan said.\nThere are less eyes on the Raptors right now, but Casey figures that will change when the regular-season tips off Oct. 28 against the Indiana Pacers.\n“I don’t feel under the radar. We’re excited about the Jays,” Casey said. “We know that 10 days from now, whatever it is from now we’ve got to toss it up for real and everybody’s focused on that.\n“We can kind of see guys’ intensity level pick up up in training camp. I know my antenna is high, the coaching staff’s antennas are high and I think that (the Jays’ success) added to the motivation of feeling the crowd and the city getting excited about something. We feel that going into next week.”\nThe electricity that’s swirled around baseball over the last few months is something that would be easily transferrable with a lengthy playoff run by any of Toronto’s other teams.\n“It’s an amazing thing when you have different fans, baseball fans gravitating toward basketball, basketball fans gravitating to hockey, soccer, whatever it is. It’s a great energy to have in the city,” DeRozan said.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays hoping for better against Volquez in Game 5", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:36:48.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
