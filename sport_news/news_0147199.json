No teams besides the Bills interviewed him at the NFL Scouting Combine, and he went on no other visits. Yet three games into his rookie season, Williams is leading the NFL in yards per carry after a 110-yard effort against the Dolphins in Week 3. How did a player with the combination of speed and power Williams has displayed last until the fifth round?\n\"He felt like he had something to prove when he got here,\" Bills offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson said. \"I definitely didn't think he would've went that low in the draft from seeing what I've seen him do when was at Florida State.\"\nThe easy answer for Williams' draft-day tumble has nothing to do with how he played. Williams was investigated for domestic violence after Miranda Wilhelm, the mother of Williams' first two children, posted photos of her bruises on Facebook saying, \"This was done to me two nights ago by a man I have lived with for two years and bared two children by.\" She later deleted the post and refused to give a statement to police. Williams was not charged.\nWilliams also allegedly negotiated a drug deal involving a 26-year-old Florida State student, Freightlin Cox, and Daravius \"Gutta\" Lawrence, the brother of the woman Williams was accused of assaulting. The deal ended in Cox getting robbed at gunpoint by two unidentified men after Williams allegedly set up a time for them to meet. Williams didn't speak with investigators and was not charged.\nThose red flags were enough to scare off every team in the NFL. Besides the Bills. Buffalo was risking more than just Williams' off-the-field history, though. The Bills were also taking a running back who had played the position for only two seasons and whose yards per carry average dropped from 8.0 to 4.6 between his junior and senior seasons.\nThat's why Williams started losing carries at Florida State. He wasn't as powerful or decisive running the football. That, in addition to the issues he was creating off the field, made him untouchable for some NFL teams. The Bills are glad they rolled the dice, though. Williams has touchdowns in each of his first three games and has, by all accounts, been a model citizen off the field since arriving in Buffalo.\nWilliams doesn't like to talk much about what happened away from the field at Florida State, other than to say he's now \"more responsible.\" Regardless or whether he's changed as a person, it's tough to ignore his transformation as a player. He's back to running like he did during the 2013 season, his first as a running back.\n\"In '13, I didn't worry about the read,\" Williams said. \"I didn't worry about if I was right or wrong, this and that. I just went in there and ran the ball tough and physical. I think going into my senior year, 2014, I started to critique myself and lost that feel for just running the football and running hard and tried to focus on what a true running back focuses on, the reads and techniques. I think I lost that physical running hard and that passion the way I ran in 2013.\"\nHeading into a Week 4 matchup against the Giants, Williams will get a chance to make his first NFL start with starter LeSean McCoy out with a hamstring injury.\n\"You gotta understand, we look at it like this: If you're on the team you are a starter, because at some point you're gonna play,\" offensive coordinator Greg Roman said. \"I love his attitude, his work ethic, his approach every day, and I love what he brings on the field obviously. I think that's pretty apparent. The Giants are gonna be a tough challenge and I think Karlos will be up for the challenge.\"\nBills linebacker Nigel Bradham knows firsthand the type of challenge the Giants are in for with Williams. Bradham, who played with Williams and his brother, Vince, at Florida State, has been watching Karlos since high school, when he was a dominant safety. He's also had to tackle Karlos in practice and knows Giants players are going to be sore after Sunday.\n\"I ain't going to give them any tips,\" Bradham said with a laugh. \"Just be ready. You know you going to get you a hard runner, I can tell them that much.\"\nIf the NFL did the draft over, maybe Williams would go higher. Rex Ryan thinks he would, and so do Williams' teammates. Maybe the off-field issues would still scare teams away. For as many yards as Williams piles up, out-running his past will never be easy.\n\"Lucky enough, it was early enough in his career that he can bounce back and learn from it,\" Bradham said. \"That's another thing I'm sure that keeps him motivated. I know he's going to keep his nose clean and stay focused. That's the main thing for him, just keep living right.\"\nIf he is able to keep his nose clean, maybe Williams will live up to his enormous physical gifts. If he does, Bradham won't be surprised.\n\"You always knew,\" Bradham said. \"From the time he was young, you just always knew. To me, he's a complete back. He's got a bright future.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:09:25.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
