Game: Riverwood (4-1, 2-0) at Sprayberry (4-1, 2-0) 7:30 p.m. Last year: Sprayberry 31, Riverwood 24 (2OT) All-time series: Sprayberry leads 4-3Prediction: Sprayberry 28, Riverwood 24Sprayberry enters tonight’s game against Riverwood looking to extend its winning streak to five games and take sole possession of first place in Region 7 (B). The Yellow Jackets have been particularly strong in their two subregion victories over North Springs and North Atlanta, outscoring them by a combined 70-14.“We’ve played well in all three phases of the game,” Sprayberry coach Billy Shackelford said. “We’re not hurting ourselves and winning the turnover battle. Our defense has put pressure on the quarterback and made tackles. Our kickers have also performed well.”Riverwood is also undefeated in region play, outscoring North Atlanta and Forsyth Central 100-16 over the past two weeks. “We have been playing like a team, encouraging each other and holding everyone accountable for mistakes,” coach Ben Stready said.After scoring only seven points in its season-opening loss to South Paulding, the Yellow Jackets’ offense has averaged more than 33 points a game.“Our offense will have to be balanced, manage the clock and take care of the football against Riverwood’s defense,” Shackelford said.The Raiders’ offense averages more than 229 rushing yards a contest led by Marvin Kinsey Jr., who has 776 yards on the ground this season and seven touchdowns. Evan Crossing has four touchdown receptions for Riverwood.“They have athletes who can go the distance,” Shackelford said. “We will have our hands full with their receivers and must contain them on special teams and returns.”Riverwood is seeking to make the state playoffs for only the third time since 1997, having made the postseason in 2001 and 2013. Sprayberry’s last trip to the playoffs took place in 2009.“Sprayberry is a formidable opponent for us,” Stready said. “They’re big, strong and fast. It should be a very interesting night.”Game: North Springs (1-3, 0-1) at Kell (3-2, 1-1), 7:30 p.m. Last year: Kell 55, North Springs 14All-time series: Kell leads 3-0Prediction: Kell 35, North Springs 10Kell’s 2015 season has been one of ups and downs and reminiscent of a Jekyll and Hyde story.One minute, the Longhorns are shutting out teams 35-0 in the Georgia Dome, and then the next their losing at home for the first time in 28 games.Last week, Cambridge outscored Kell 14-0 in the second half and dropped the Longhorns to 3-2 for the first time since 2011. Entering tonight’s matchup against North Springs, which Kell has outscored 138-14 in three previous meetings, the Longhorns hope they’re able to work on the issues that have plagued the team, especially within the running game.“When the running game isn’t working, you make yourself one dimensional, and our passing game hasn’t been strong enough to open lanes and move guys away from the box,” Kell coach Derek Cook said. “So, we’ve been struggling. We’re not consistent enough.”Part of the problems for Kell have been injuries along the offensive line. Starters Elijah Owens at left guard and right tackle James DeMatto have been limited while battling ankle injuries, forcing reserve players into often ad-verse situations.“You have backups coming in that aren’t quite there yet being asked to make plays and starters battling injuries trying to push through the pain,” Cook said. “We have to pass protect and throw the ball, and we’re close on so many diferent plays and so many situations, but it hasn’t happened yet, and we’re running out of time.”Cook believes the Longhorns just have to continue to work on improving in order to get the offense to click.“We have to figure out how to make it better,” he said. “It’s about repetition and repeating those plays even more to make it sharp. We’ve been moving in that direction during practice this week, and we’re working hard to rectify what needs to be addressed.” Share This Article | similar stories Kell set for subregion play | 14 days ago by Adam Carrington acarrington@mdjonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:41:08.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
