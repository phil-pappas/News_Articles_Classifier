They had gotten drubbed earlier in the day and had been run ragged by a seemingly endless itinerary of events while serving as ambassadors for the NBA.\nThe thought of your own mattress, your own pillows, your own house – Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan had to have wanted to go home.\nBut, there was somewhere else they had to be.\nBleary-eyed and jet lagged, Griffin and Jordan got on a plane to Las Vegas.\nThe next day, Chris Paul followed.\nLamar Odom was in a hospital bed, fighting for his life, and his former teammates had to be there.\n“He probably has no idea we were there,” Griffin said. “But just to be there and to see him, hopefully he knows there’s a lot of guys that love him and want to see him do better, and want to see him get better.”\nIn 2012, the Clippers took a gamble on Odom, sending out Mo Williams in a multi-team trade to get the former Sixth Man of the Year back in a deal.\nHe was coming off a disastrous season in Dallas, which the cameras of his reality show, “Khloe & Lamar” captured.\nThe move to Dallas followed a summer filled with unthinkable tragedy. A day after attending the funeral for his 24-year-old cousin, a car Odom was riding in hit a motorcycle, which then went out of control, eventually killing a 15-year-old pedestrian.\nMonths later, his name was a part of the trade rumors connected to the nixed Paul-to-the- Lakers deal. He eventually landed with the Mavericks, but he never found a role amid sporadic production.\nHe didn’t finish the year with the team.\nStill, the Clippers wanted to take a chance on Odom, and he was thrilled to be back home. “Sometimes we go through things in life that hold us back. I put those things behind me,” Odom said after re-joining the Clippers. “It's time to move forward. It’s time to be fresh again.”\nIn between the smiles and the poses with his familiar Clipper uniform, Odom repeated what would eventually become a common refrain.\n“Hopefully, I can turn back the clock on the court,” Odom said.\nBut time, it doesn’t stop.\nOut of shape when training camp opened, Odom missed two weeks in the preseason with what the team called “bone bruises.”\nBut despite the extra pounds, Odom managed to work himself into the rotation on opening night. He would play in all 82 games for the Clippers that season.\n“I remember talking to Lamar about this – I was really proud of him,” former Clipper Willie Green said. “He played in 82 games. And, we all know that he wasn’t the Lamar we were used to seeing, but night in and night out, he came in and gave us everything he had. We needed him, and he knew it.”\nBut Odom couldn’t help – at least, not consistently.\nDuring that season, his last in the NBA, Odom averaged only 4.0 points per game. He shot under 40 percent from the field and only 20 percent from 3-point range. But, for the most part, Odom was happy.\n“He was probably one of the most honest individuals I’ve met,” Green said. “No matter what it was. If he stunk it up one night, he’d say, ‘Man, I was terrible tonight.’ There wasn’t any sugar-coating. It was genuine.\n“…But every night, good bad or ugly, he was there. After the game, he’d be cracking jokes, dancing – just having a ball.”\nGrant Hill, who also was playing in his final NBA season, said Odom had the spirit of a rookie that season – someone who was just so happy to be in the NBA.\n“He got a lot of joy from the team and being around everyone,” Hill said. “He seemed like he really cherished that environment. It was like family to him.\n“… He really enjoyed being a basketball player. He enjoyed, not what people might call the grind, he enjoyed coming to work – the banter, the camaraderie that can be developed. He had fun that year. He enjoyed it.”\nEven though it was clear he wasn’t going to be able to turn back the clock, there were brief trips back to better days.\nThere was the night when he had 13 rebounds and four blocks against Doc Rivers and the Boston Celtics. There were the 18 points he had in a win over Utah and the 13 rebounds, six assists and eight points he had against Portland.\n“He wasn’t the same player at that time – not the one we had grown accustomed to – but you still, at times, saw the versatility. You saw the talent,” Hill said. “You saw what made him special. You just didn’t see it as frequently.”\nBut the pain in his life was never too far away.\nEvery so often, Odom would open up to teammates about the tragedies that surrounded him – the death of his mother at a young age, the loss of his son to sudden infant death syndrome, the depression he battled with.\n“It was more than anyone should have to endure – your mom dying while you were at a young age and to lose a child at such a young age,” said Hill, “but I didn’t know there was even more.”\nThe “even more” became apparent once basketball no longer became an option for Odom.\nFollowing his season with the Clippers, he was charged with a DUI. There were rumors of drug use. His marriage to Khloe Kardashian dissolved while the paparazzi readied their cameras.\nThings seemed to be getting worse and Odom’s former teammates and friends in the NBA heard from him less and less.\nAnd then, this past week, Odom was found unconscious at a Las Vegas brothel , reportedly with drugs in his system.\nEx-teammates feared it would be the final chapter in a life full of sorrow.\n“Everyone who knows him feels the same way – heartbroken,” Green said. “We’re still hoping. We’re still praying, hoping for a good outcome.”\nOdom’s condition has reportedly improved in recent days, with news that he’s regained consciousness raising hope that prayers from Green and Odom’s former teammates had been answered.\nAnd with an uphill battle still ahead of him, Odom must try and draw from one of the lessons he passed on during his final stint in the league.\n“(It was) the way he went about it and the way he kind of helped us through the ups and the downs of the season,” Griffin said. “He was great for me in teaching me that you’re going to have bad games, you’re going to have a bad stretch of the season, just shake it off, stay loose, stay happy, and he was great about it, keeping us happy.”\nWith his life on the line, he’ll need to take his own advice.\nContact the writer: dwoike@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:50:00.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
