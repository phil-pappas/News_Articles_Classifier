DeSean Jackson FILE - In this Sunday, Oct. 12, 2014 file photo, Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson (11) makes a catch against the Arizona Cardinals during the second half of an NFL football game in Glendale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri, File) (Rick Scuteri) Comments \nCulture! Or something like that. \nIt has been roughly two years since the Eagles cut wide receiver DeSean Jackson, controversially letting him go after a Pro-Bowl season. \nJackson ended up signing with the division-rival Washington Redskins, but his time might soon be up there as well. \nIn a recent article, Washington Post's Mike Jones -- one of the top Redskins beat reporters -- was asked about the team's receiving core. \nHis answer included the possibility the team might like Jackson go at the end of this season. \nI'm expecting an overhaul of the receiving corps this offseason. I can't see them bringing DeSean Jackson back to the tune of 9.25 million next season . He's not reliable enough. Explosive, yes. But he's not very versatile or dependable. Cutting him would save $8 million against the cap. Garcon has a cap number of $10.2 million next season, but the team could cut him and save another $8 million. But Garcon is the type of guy that McCloughan loves. Tough, physical, hard-working, character guy. The problem is, Gruden doesn't appear to value Garcon. If the coach does, then his play-calling suggests otherwise. Grant is a good route runner, but his impact is minimal. Crowder is a nice piece, but he's at best a No. 2 receiver because of his lack of size. The Redskins definitely need to get bigger and more explosive at wide receiver in 2016. BRADFORD: QB's play could keep Eagles out of playoffs \nJackson has played in 16 games for the Redskins since signing, hauling in 56 catches for 1,169 yards and six touchdowns. He has played in just one game this season for the Redskins, and didn't record a catch before going down with an injured hamstring. \nHe signed a four-year, $24 million deal in the 2014 offseason, but so far, it doesn't seem like that was money well spent for the Redskins. \nAs for the Eagles, the argument can be made releasing Jackson hasn't worked out for them either, as their offense has lacked an explosive threat down the field since his departure. \nBut hey, if Jones is right, the Eagles could always bring Jackson back next offseason! THE NO-HUDDLE SHOW, Ep. 13: Sam Bradford stinks right now, but at least the Eagles' defense is great \nThe Eagles just crushed their division rival to take over first place in the NFC East, but given how sloppy the passing game was, it doesn't feel as good as it should.
