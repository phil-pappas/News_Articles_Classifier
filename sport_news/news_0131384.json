He had missed just one game in the past four seasons.\nYet now he is in danger of missing this week’s game against the Lions after playing a limited role in Week 3. Calf and neck issues have hampered Lynch so far this year, and now it is a hamstring problem threatening to sideline him Monday night.\nUndrafted rookie Thomas Rawls was one of the hottest pickups in fantasy football this week after rushing for 104 yards against Chicago. He has a determined, unrelenting style that shows he has learned from Lynch, who was noted by teammate Doug Baldwin for how he “coaches up” the other RBs.\nRawls has earned starting status in fantasy this week against a Lions defense that has allowed 112 rushing yards per game and five rushing scores. It may be surprising to see Lynch play this week, and he could be very limited if he is out there.\nIf you badly are in need of RB help this week, especially in a PPR league, consider Fred Jackson, who could see an increased role as a pass-catcher and could conceivably get goal-line work over Rawls. He is widely available and Pete Carroll has indicated the two could share a workload.\n\nWord out of Houston is Arian Foster is on track to return from a groin injury and likely will be active against Atlanta. A source told FNTSY he should be in line for at least 10 carries as the Texans want to play ball control against Atlanta and need to get Foster rolling because they have a short week with a Thursday night game in Week 5. Andrew Luck (shoulder) has been limited in practices this week, but is expected to play. He may not fully be himself, though, so expect Frank Gore to see a significant workload and don’t expect much upside from Luck, who is hard to bench unless you have another high-quality QB. Andre Ellington (knee) may return this week, but Chris Johnson will still start against St. Louis and is worth flex consideration. DeMarco Murray (hamstring) is listed as questionable, and Ryan Mathews may again be in for an expanded role after an impressive outing against the Jets last week. Drew Brees (shoulder) is expected to play against Dallas, but his downfield ability could be affected, so he is not a must-start as he often has been throughout his career.
