Here are five things fans of the Aggies should know about their opponent:\n1. Big game for Bielema: Just a few short weeks ago, head coach Bret Bielema's Arkansas Razorbacks sat at No. 18 in the AP rankings and were considered to be a dark horse contender in the talent stacked SEC West. The weeks that followed have felt anything but short for Razorback fans as the team has stumbled to 1-2 in non-conference play, dropping last week's contest to Texas Tech by a score of 35-24.\nWhen the Southwest Classic kicks off at 6:00 p.m. at AT&T Stadium in Arlington on Saturday, the Razorbacks have a chance to right the ship by starting conference play with a victory and return excitement to a season on the verge of being lost. The SEC West can still be won by the squad from Fayetteville and it starts by defeating the No. 14 Texas A&M team also in contention for the crown.\nA loss won't make the cushion scalding to the touch, but will certainly heat the seat of the third year Arkansas coach.\n2. Ouch Pig Sooie: Senior quarterback Brandon Allen appears to have all day to throw (more stats to back that up shortly), but due to injuries, he needs that time to simply find a healthy receiver.\nAmong the injured Razorbacks are Keon Hatcher (13 catches, 198 yards, 2 TDs), Cody Hollister (4 catches, 65 yards), and Jared Cornelius (150 receiving yards, 55 punt return yards). Despite the injuries outside, the Arkansas passing attack is currently No. 1 in the conference. Allen has thrown for 916 yards on the season.\nMaking up for the lost talent on the offensive side is junior tight end Hunter Henry. He currently has a team leading 14 receptions, good for 191 yards and a TD through the first three games. A preseason All-American, the native of Little Rock will command attention from the Aggie defense all evening long.\n4. No points for talking: A lot has been made of the personal relationship between Bielema and Kingsbury over the last week. If you were paying close attention, an actual football game took place between the two teams before the talking took over.\nKingsbury runs a similar offense to A&M, but it isn't as simple as expe cting the same game plan in a different colored uniform.\nOn top of that, Sumlin, Jake Spavital, and the rest of the A&M staff have done an excellent job of offering up a variety of looks on offense in non-conference play. Depth has started to build in College Station and it is becoming necessary to game plan for guys, that at first glance, appear to be buried on the depth chart.\nSimply put, a response to the trash talk was great fodder to get through the work week. If the Razorback defense hasn't spent time planning for how to contain dual-threat QB Kyler Murray on a special package or how to properly cover a receiver who sees limited snaps such as Jeremy Tabuyo, Bielema may find himself discussing his 1-3 record at press conferences next week.\nWinning in the trenches: Arkansas is a team that focuses strongly on the middle of the field, and for good reason. The offensive line is the largest, in terms of average weight, of any line in both the college or NFL level. All that weight has paid off in regards to quarterback protection, as the Razorbacks have yet to allow a sack this season.\nAlex Collins has netted 351 yards and three scores for Arkansas in the rushing game this year on 60 carries. If running backs can manage to find a hole up front against the A&M defense and get into the second level, they have a shot to break off a long run as seen several times this year.\nWith a focus on success in the middle of the field and a benefit of a mammoth-sized line, the Razorbacks could pull off an upset of the Aggies should they execute and eliminate mistakes. With defensive terrors like Myles Garrett and Daeshon Hall working to break the no-sack streak, it will be easier said than done.\nBoth teams have preached being physical all season long. Whichever can do so better on Saturday will likely come out victorious.\n5. What have they done lately: Most coaches would likely prefer to play at home if given the choice, but AT&T Stadium isn't a bad option for Bielema's squad. A win on Saturday would improve the Razorbacks' all-time record at Jerry World to 5-1 and be their first win in an SEC opener since 2010.\nBielema enters the game with a 17-11 overall record with the Razorbacks and is winless in two attempts against A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin. Arkansas must also claim victory in order to prevent the 2015 senior class of A&M from becoming the first to win four consecutive games against Arkansas in over 80 years.\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland"], "published": "2015-09-24T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:42:46.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
