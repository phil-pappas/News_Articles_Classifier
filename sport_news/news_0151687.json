Omar Osorio teaches physical education from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Clinton, but class isn't dismissed after the final bell.\nOsorio coaches the Clinton girls soccer team, and this spring has been a learning experience for his inexperienced Governors.\n\"I teach the sport with this team - this is what I love to do,\" Osorio said. \"They don't come in with much experience, so we go through the fundamentals. In the start it was shaky, but things are starting to sink in.\"\nOsorio said he works with players in the classroom to teach them the rules and the basics of positioning. The coach also gives the players homework - like watching soccer on the weekend - to make sure the lessons take hold.\nThe Governors have proved to be a quick study. They are 9-0-1 and have already locked up the Bronx-Manhattan B Ii division title.\n\"I've definitely seen the results,\" Osorio said.\nOne player who hasn't had to learn the sport from scratch is junior forward Raycine Taylor, who ran track her first two years at Clinton but also has played youth soccer. This year she chose the soccer pitch with a little prodding from her mother.\n... along with Dominique Dunkley (15) ... \"My mom said, 'You're lazy, you don't want to do anything. Just go out there and have fun,'\" Taylor said. \"That's what I do.\"\nTaylor was all smiles at practice last Thursday, and she had plenty of reasons to celebrate.\nThe center midfielder joined the team late, but scored five goals and two assists in eight games.\n\"She can go by anybody on the field whenever she wants,\" Osorio said.\nBut the coach is quick to add: \"I don't have any heroes on my team - it takes 11 to win.\"\nOsorio proved his point when he booted two seniors from the team for what he called selfish play early this season.\n... and Tamika Coates (12), helps Clinton to undefeated record. Freshman Tamika Coates said the team's improved chemistry has been one key to its undefeated start.\n\"We get along really well - we communicate,\" said Coates, a freshman forward who leads Clinton with seven goals in 10 games, the third-best total in the division. \"Sometimes with a team of all girls, you don't always get along, but we are fine.\"\nCoates, who played two years of organized soccer before suiting up for Clinton, said Osorio's on- and off-field lessons have helped galvanize the Governors' attack.\n\"The time he takes with us and the knowledge he shares with us really help,\" Coates said.\nFellow freshman forward Crystal Warburton agreed. She may have been caught off guard the first time she was sent home from soccer practice with a homework assignment - like diagramming a play. But Warburton, who has five goals this season, said the assignments have helped her to better understand the sport.\n\"There's no grades, but it counts for something,\" Warburton said. \"It counts for knowledge of the game, and now we have that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:09:46.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
