Cougars fall to Empire for first loss of season By ED PETRUSKA, Staff Writer Casa Grande Valley Newspapers Inc. CASA GRANDE — Pushed to five games for the second time in three matches, the Casa Grande Union volleyball team could not subdue the Empire Ravens on Thursday night. The Cougars lost for the first time this season as Empire prevailed 3-2 at Jack Spilsbury Gym. Game scores were 25-13, 13-25, 25-19, 15-25, 15-11. “We were off tonight,” CG Union coach Matt Reeves said. “Our biggest problem was we struggled with our serve receive. We weren’t making good passes to run a productive offense. We made simple errors and they took advantage.” The Cougars (9-1, 0-1 Division III/Section 3), who defeated host Poston Butte 3-2 on Sept. 24, were ranked No. 9 going into the match. Empire (4-3, 1-0) was No. 42. But the Ravens put CG Union in a catch-up mode from the outset, starting with a 9-0 run in Game 1 that gave them a 17-6 lead. Empire took command of Game 3 with a 9-3 surge that left the Cougars trailing 19-9. And after CG Union went ahead 9-8 in Game 5, the Ravens went up 14-9 with a 6-0 run. Two kills by Madison Farrow kept the Cougars’ hopes alive before Emily Brown recorded Empire’s lone block for match point. There were just four lead changes in the match — two in Game 2 and two in Game 5. “We played with energy and confidence when we had the lead, but we seemed to lose a little heart when we fell behind,” Reeves said. Now that the best start in program history is behind them, Reeves hopes the loss “relieves the stress of being undefeated and that we go back to playing hard and finish the season strong.” The Cougars outscored the Ravens in kills (30-26) and aces (15-12). Farrow led CG Union with 12 kills, Nicolette Savage had eight, and Skylar Redd had five kills and a team-best four aces. Alexis Reeves had three kills, Hannah Norris had three aces, and Ashlyn Norris had two aces and one kill. Delany Barber had nine kills for the Ravens, and Skylar Duhon had six kills and three aces. CG Union took the lead in Game 5 for the first time at 8-7 on Redd’s ace. Farrow’s kill gave the Cougars their final lead at 9-8. The Ravens went ahead to stay at 10-9 on Brown’s kill, and the decisive run ended with Barber’s kill. Duhon had three of Empire’s four aces in Game 1. The Ravens also had four aces in Game 3 — two by Kayla Long — and four kills apiece from Duhon and Barber. CG Union had nine kills (four by Farrow) and four aces (two by Hannah Norris) in Game 2. Farrow had three of the Cougars’ nine kills in Game 4. They scored six points on aces, getting two apiece from Chase Conaway and Ashlyn Norris. Redd had two aces and Alexis Reeves had two kills during an 11-1 surge in Game 2 that sent the Cougars to a 19-9 lead. CG Union closed Game 4 with a 4-0 run, with the last two points coming on aces by Conaway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:42:33.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
