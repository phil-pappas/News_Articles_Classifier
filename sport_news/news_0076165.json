However, a Smyrna win would create either a two-way or three-way tie depending on what the Blaze do in their finale. Blackman plays at Warren County (1-8, 0-6). \nSmyrna would be the top seed over Oakland due to a head-to-head win if the Pioneers upset Blackman. If Smyrna and Blackman win, Smyrna would be first because its opponents will finish with more wins than either Oakland and Blackman, which is the TSSAA's fourth tiebreaker in determining playoff order. If Smyrna wins, Oakland is second and Blackman is third regardless of what the Blaze do Saturday. \n\"If we want the No. 1 seed, we have to win,\" Oakland coach Kevin Creasy said. \"We understand what we are play for. It should be a great game.\" \nCreasy said he hadn't looked at the playoff seeding scenarios prior to Saturday morning. \n\"It goes to that fourth tiebreaker,\" \nIf Smyrna and Blackman win, the three teams would tie in the first three categories — greatest number of victories, team that played most teams that won 50 percent or more of their games and team with the most wins over teams winning 50 percent or more of their games. \nSmyrna's opponents currently have three more overall wins than Blackman and Oakland, and neither can make that up in the final week. \n\"Our goal was a region championship at the first of the year,\" said Smyrna coach Matt Williams after the Bulldogs' 21-14 win over Riverdale Friday night. \"That opportunity is still there.\" \nSlot four through seven also have not yet been determined for 2-6A. \nThe Cookeville-Riverdale winner will be fourth with the loser being fifth. \nThe Coffee County-Siegel winner will be sixth with the loser being seventh. \nWarren County is eighth. \nAll 32 teams in Class 6A are automatically in the playoffs. \nAlso not yet determined is Region 5-5A, where three teams have a spot for two playoff berths. \nIndependence will be the top seed from 5-5A. La Vergne has locked up a playoff berth, but could be anywhere from the second seed through the fourth depending on the Week 11 outcomes. \nStewarts Creek (6-3, 4-2), Lincoln County (6-3, 3-3) and Shelbyville (6-3, 3-3) are all fighting for the remaining two spots. A Stewarts Creek win over Lincoln County or a Shelbyville loss to Franklin County (3-6. 2-4) guarantees Creek its first playoff appearance. \nHowever, if Creek loses to Lincoln County, La Vergne loses to Independence and Shelbyville wins against Franklin County, the Red Hawks would be out of the playoffs. \n\"We control where we are going to fall,\" Stewarts Creek David Martin said. \"We're in control of it. \n\"It's fun to be relevant. It's nice to be in the talk for the playoffs. We are relevant in what is going on.\" \nEagleville also remains in the playoff hunt. The Eagleville-Community winner will be the fourth seed from Region 4-2A. MTCS was eliminated from the 1A playoffs with its loss to Nashville Christian. \nReach Tom Kreager at 615-278-5168 and on Twitter @Kreager. \nWeek 11 Schedule \n(All games 7 p.m., Friday) \nOakland at Smyrna* \nLincoln Co. at Stewarts Creek \nCommunity at Eagleville \nCoffee Co. at Siegel, 7 p.m. \nBlackman at Warren Co., \nCannon Co. at DeKalb Co.** \n*WGNS (1450-AM, 100.5-FM, 101.9-FM) 31 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.dnj.com/1S35pQA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:13:19.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
