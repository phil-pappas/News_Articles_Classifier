Despite his previous flirtations with the NFL (not to mention all the off-the-field issues that have occurred under his regime) Kelly has brought a fair amount of stability to the program. He’s done a much better job than Bob Davie, Tyrone Willingham and Charlie Weis (or George O’Leary for that matter). Kelly has weathered quite a few storms during his time at ND, and through it all demonstrated some consistency. Sure, there’s been an insane amount of drama during his regime, but he always gets past it relatively unscathed. In the NFL, every team is loaded with players that have “character issues,” and fallout often ensues. Kelly has shown a tremendous ability to handle that kind of thing. He’s been linked with a possible move to the NFL a couple times already. How close he’s actually come depends on who you talk to, but it’s widely believed that it was Brian Kelly, not Chip Kelly, the Philadelphia Eagles originally wanted as ESPN reported the Eagles interviewing Kelly in 2013 . Now there’s talk that we could potentially see a second Kelly joining Chip in the NFC East next year (provided Tom Coughlin is ousted of course). Here’s NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport On college head coaches who could make the jump to the NFL: “First of all, UCLA coach Jim Mora, of course an NFL veteran. He is open to the idea of returning to the NFL, which is really not a surprise. But the only thing that might give him some pause is he has a great young quarterback now that he might want to ride a little bit now into the next couple of years. Another big name open to returning: Kevin Sumlin of Texas A&M. He’s been the hot name in NFL circles at this point, especially given the sort of lack of success of his team this year. Also open to coming to the NFL. Here is a name that might be a little surprising: Brian Kelly of Notre Dame. He has had a lot of success there and continues to have some success. If you want to pair him with a potential opening when I talked to general managers around the league, the place they believe he fits: the New York Giants if they decide to make a change.” The 12-1 season of 2012 was no doubt the high water mark for BK at ND. Yes, it ended with an embarrassing destruction at the hands of Alabama in the national title game, but ’12 was also the greatest season that Notre Dame football has seen in a generation. It proved that Brian Kelly could build a program a South Bend, much like he built programs at Cincinanti, Central Michigan and Grand Valley State. Brian Kelly is also a very rare breed in this sense- a revenue producing sport coaching hire by Mike Thomas that was actually very successful. Many of Thomas’ other hires in the sports that count have been abysmal failures. If/when a NFL team does hire Brian Kelly, he’ll build that program up too. Paul M.
