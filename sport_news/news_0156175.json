Before dropping a 26-24 decision to Central Catholic Saturday night , they hadn’t lost a regular season contest since Oct. 25, 2013. \nBut for coach Steve Shiffert, a loss is a loss and he’s focused on how his team responds to it. \n“It’s just like our first game this year – we had to come back from a loss at the end of last season that these guys experienced,” Shiffert said. “They just know they gotta work harder and be more consistent with their things.” \nRELATED : Who is the best running back in the Lehigh Valley? (VOTE) \nAfter the loss to the Vikings, Shiffert harped on lackadaisical practices turning into a sloppy game. So far this week, he’s seen better things when the lights aren’t on. \n“They’re stepping it up,” he said. “We’re starting to get a little more cracks on the practice field. I think the kids know they can’t just walk and go through the motions.” \nShiffert is looking for his captains to take on a little more leadership following the loss, but also pointed to the 30-plus seniors on the team. \n“They all gotta pitch in,” Shiffert said. “That’s what we’re looking for: more togetherness from them and a little more hustle.” \nThe film of the Central Catholic game showed some blown assignments but also poor technique in the fourth quarter, Shiffert said. \nEaston will be looking to improve both Friday night at Cottingham Stadium when it plays its final EPC crossover game before getting into the meat of its schedule. \n“We gotta get back to our winning ways here cause we know the last five weeks of the season are going to be really tough,” Shiffert said. \nAnd any worries about looking past Friday’s game because of the opponent went down the drain with Saturday’s loss. \n“We can’t look ahead after coming off a loss, it’s that simple,” Shiffert said. “We know we got an opponent that’s capable of beating us and I think it can happen to any of us in this league.” \nEast Stroudsburg South’s player to watch : Jake Cirillo . The junior quarterback stood out to the Easton coaching staff when it scouted the Cavaliers earlier this year. He has completed 36 of 78 passes for 637 yards and two touchdowns, while throwing for more than 1,000 yards in each of his freshman and sophomore years. “They have an outstanding quarterback, a kid that likes to stay in the pocket and throw, but will take off when need be,” Shiffert said. Cirillo’s top target is Changa Hodge . \nEaston’s player to watch: Richie Tattoli . The tight end/safety has quietly put together a solid year for the Red Rovers, catching two touchdowns on offense and ranking third on the team with 17 tackles. While Easton will look to run first, especially in this game, Tattoli is a strong option for quarterback Trey Durrah to throw to. On defense, he’ll be looking to shut down Cirillo. \nEast Stroudsburg South will win if … It can jump out in front early. With Easton coming off a loss, the Cavaliers could really use a big first quarter to keep them down. The Red Rovers got hurt last week by a lot of short passes, so don’t be surprised if Cirillo tries to follow the same game plan. \nEaston will win if … It can pound the ball on the ground. That’s their goal every week, but it’s especially important here to turn in a bounce-back effort. Running on East Stroudsburg South will chew up the clock but also keep the defense off the field, and it’s what the Red Rovers do best. It’ll be the best recipe for putting last week’s loss in the past.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:34:56.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
