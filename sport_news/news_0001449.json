The Rams haven’t been able to beat their own shadows. \nIf the Huskies win, or even if they lose, they’re in, barring a miracle. A few weeks ago, the Bears were whacked 80-18 by the Calgary Dinos, who visit Foote Field Saturday for what used to be a good old-fashioned Edmonton-Calgary hoedown. \nI can’t imagine Alberta turning that verdict upside down. Can you? \nFor me, the worst of it is this: Golden Bears failure is compounded by the dismal status of both the Edmonton Huskies and Wildcats in the Prairie Junior Football Conference. \nAnd the fact that both junior teams missed the playoffs and were rarely contenders in any game, is compounded by the reality that Calgary’s high school teams have been superior to Edmonton’s in recent seasons and there is a strong likelihood that it will be the same again when provincial titles go on the agenda in November. \nThere must be a way of clearing up this mess. \nJunior football guys who blame Golden Bears coach Chris Morris – and there are many – refuse to deal with the reality that junior coaching, especially among assistants, is often inexperienced and, more often, simply inept. \nAt the high school level, it is become necessary for many schools to find coaches apart from their own staffs. Those so-called outsiders, willing to put up the time and effort necessary to build or recreate good programs, often lack daily and weekly in-class opportunities that regular teachers find so beneficial. \nDon’t ask me why, but I’m convinced nothing will change until the Bears and the junior operators come to a common goal in terms of recruiting and sharing information. \nUntil then, those who care about Edmonton football can only wait, fingers crossed.
