(AP) â€” Talladega Superspeedway said Thursday it will have energy-absorbing barriers around the entire track when NASCAR races there this month. Talladega chairman Grant Lynch said the track has added 8,000 feet of SAFER barrier this year. The inside and outside walls are now completely covered at the 2.66-mile track. The track initially added three sections of SAFER barrier before its May race. The barriers cost between $500-600 per foot. All NASCAR tracks underwent a safety review after Kyle Busch broke his right leg and left foot in a Feb. 21 crash into a concrete wall at Daytona. All have either added SAFER barriers or said the material would be added this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:08:02.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
