Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon played a correct hunch. And the Cubs even got a huge break. Still it wasn't enough for them to overcome the New York Mets in Game 3 of the National League championship series. The Mets broke a 2-2 tie with a run on a strikeout-wild pitch in the sixth inning and added 2 more in the seventh to beat the Cubs 5-2 and take a three-games-to-none lead in the best-of-seven series. With a victory Wednesday night, the Mets will punch their ticket to the World Series while the Cubs will head home for the winter. The pitching matchup in this one didn't look good for the Cubs from the get-go. The Cubs sent Kyle Hendricks to the mound against tough right-hander Jacob deGrom, who beat the Los Angeles Dodgers twice in the division series. Hendricks navigated his way through an up-and-down regular season. He found trouble in the first inning when Curtis Granderson led off and reached on an error by Cubs shortstop Javier Baez. Granderson was caught trying to steal second base, but David Wright singled as he emerged from a postseason batting slump. After the dangerous Daniel Murphy struck out, Yoenis Cespedes doubled home right. The Cubs have a dangerous hitter of their own in Kyle Schwarber, and he quickly tied the game in the bottom of the first with an opposite-field homer to left-center. The home run was the rookie's fifth of the postseason, giving him the Cubs' record for postseason home runs. Murphy answered with his sixth of the postseason in the third with two outs to put the Mets ahead 2-1. Tuesday warm weather made it easy for Maddon to put right fielder Jorge Soler back into the starting lineup. Soler, who is much more partial to warm weather than cold, lined a home run to right-center in the fourth to tie the game at 2-2. \"Soler is in the lineup because in this ballpark, under these conditions, there is a decent opportunity he could put the ball over the wall,\" a prophetic-sounding Maddon said before the game. The Cubs managed to coax 4 innings out of Hendricks, who gave way to Clayton Richard in the fifth. Things got interesting in the top of the sixth, when the Mets scored a run but could have blown the game open. With two outs and Cespedes on third base, Michael Conforto struck out against Trevor Cahill, who has a good sinker. But the ball got away from catcher Miguel Montero for a wild pitch and a dropped third strike, allowing Cespedes to score. The Cubs got their break when Wilmer Flores' hit to right field got past Soler. Conforto would have scored easily, but the ball got stuck in the ivy for a ground-rule double, meaning Conforto had to go back to third base. Mets manager Terry Collins argued vociferously with home-plate umpire Ted Barrett, but the call was out of the umpires' hands because of the Wrigley Field ground rule. DeGrom field out to end the inning with only 1 run having scored. The Mets did manage a pair of important runs in the seventh. Wright doubled against Travis Wood and went to third on Murphy's infield hit. Maddon turned to right-handed reliever Justin Grimm, who got Cespedes to line to left field. However, the ball went off Schwarber's glove. The play was ruled an RBI single. Lucas Duda then grounded out to first base, but Anthony Rizzo's throw home was not in time to get Murphy, scored. Before the game, Maddon was steadfast in saying no major shake-ups or changes in approach from him were needed after the Cubs lost two games in New York. \"Part of it is the moment you do, the players feel it,\" he said. \"They think something's wrong. There is really nothing wrong. Truly there is not right now. I would probably do something differently or change something if I really thought it was necessary. But our group has been so consistent in their methods all year, and even more recently. Our record, I guess, from August to this point, is like the best at baseball. So why would I ever all of a sudden change because we've lost two games in New York in the end of October? I don't get that. They're well, they're rested, they're in a good place mentally. For me to do something differently, I would send out all kinds of indicators to them that I don't want them to read into. \"They need stability and consistency from me daily, and I think if I supply that, then they're going to kind of react the same way in return.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:23:32.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
