Meanwhile, linebacker IK Enemkpali, best known for his sucker punch that broke Jets quarterback Geno Smith’s jaw during training camp, is thrilled to be making his Bills debut this weekend.\nWatkins, who had 65 catches for 982 yards as a rookie, has just seven receptions for 99 yards and a touchdown. He’s been out with a calf injury since the first quarter of Buffalo’s win over the Dolphins on Sept. 27, and it remains uncertain whether he will play this weekend.\nBills coach Rex Ryan Photo: Getty Images “I need the ball at least 10 times — I need 10 targets — and l’ll be fine with however many yards I get,” Watkins told the newspaper. “And that’s what I addressed in talking with my agent. We reached out to a couple people and tried to pull some string like, ‘Hey, I need my targets. You came up to draft me and I’m not getting targets — that’s a problem. You’re making me look bad, and you’re making yourself look bad. Why not make both of us look good?’\n“For a guy you go up in the draft to take as your No. 1 receiver, you would love those 15 targets that Julio [Jones] gets, those 20 targets that Odell [Beckham Jr.] gets,” he added. “Of course I’d have 100 yards every game and a TD, if I’m getting 20 targets.”\nAt the other end of the spectrum is Enemkpali, whom Ryan has gone above and beyond to support despite his off-the-field problems, signing him shortly after the Jets released him. Ryan drafted Enemkpali when he was with the Jets.\n“It’s been unbelievable, man,” Enemkpali said. “They just took me in, and it’s like we never lost a beat since we was at the Jets together. So it’s been great. It’s been a blessing having him and how he took me in so quickly. I can’t thank him enough.”\n  buffalo bills ,  ik enemkpali ,  rex ryan ,  sammy watkins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:47:21.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
