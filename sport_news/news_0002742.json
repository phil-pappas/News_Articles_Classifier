Their longest winless streak from the start of a season was nine games in 1984-85 (0-6 with three ties). \nKopitar scored on a 25-foot wrist shot in the first overtime game for either team in the new 3-on-3 format. \nMinnesota coach Mike Yeo challenged that L.A. was offside on Kopitar's goal, but the goal was upheld. \nFor Minnesota, Darcy Kuemper stopped 35 shots in his season debut. Kings goalie Jonathan Quick stopped 25 shots.
