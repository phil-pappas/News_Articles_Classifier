Remember, they're trying to woo me to the campus. \n\"And as a 17-year-old kid, first off, if I'm not getting laid, I'm not coming. I'm not signing. I'm not coming.\" \nRose was on a roll on the Oct. 6 installment of the \"Jalen and Jacoby\" podcast at espn.com, when the Louisville story first broke. His comments gained a little Internet traction today, with the story heated up again. \nAnd to be fair, Rose and co-host David Jacoby dealt with the Louisville subject again Tuesday, in a more nuanced podcast. \nBut on the earlier show, Rose made it clear that he was speaking \"as a high school All-American that's 17 years old\" describing his campus visits, \"not 42-year-old Jalen.\" Sullivan: Rick Pitino's time expiring at Louisville \nWhile coaches are around in the daylight hours, he said recruits then are handed over to a player host for the nighttime entertainment, the wining and dining. Usually, it's someone who plays a different position and knows how to have a good time. \n\"No. 1, I'm out of the 'hood, so I'm safe,\" Rose said. \"No. 2, I have access to unlimited funds, because I'm a high school kid who's not paying for dinners, who's not paying for anything. And it's almost like my birthday, because their No. 1 job is to show me a magnificent time -- as a matter of fact, the time of my life. \n\"When I'm at a Michigan vs. Notre Dame game, and they're playing against Rocket Ismail and he runs back two, we're on campus having a really good time,\" he said. \"We're hanging out, champagnin' and campaignin', hanging with my potential future teammates ... yes, of course women and dating are part of that scenario.\" Armour: Pitino has to go as Louisville sex scandal details emerge \nRose said he was served alcohol and introduced to young women on his visits to MSU, Syracuse, UNLV \"and you know where I went.\" \nBut to be clear, he wasn't saying that there were any escorts involved, as is alleged in the Louisville case. Not with his charm. \n\"You just take me to the well. I can drink.\" 1971 CONNECT 136 TWEET LINKEDIN 10 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1RWXAMk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:02:50.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
