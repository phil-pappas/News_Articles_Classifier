I know that they installed them to make the road a safer place, but unfortunately, they have only made the road even more dangerous. The problem is that the road is too narrow, and that people go through the roundabouts, instead of around. \nThis has almost caused accidents, and if it hasn’t already, then it certainly will in the future. They also make it imposable for school buses to drop kid off close to their homes. We have to walk a mile or more to our houses, as opposed to two years ago, when it dropped everyone off within three minutes of walking distance. \nBrant Perkins \nWritten by Contributed · Filed Under Letters to the Editor \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:07:47.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
