IMAGE: Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez has been in red-hot form and there will expectations of him scoring against Bayern. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images \nA rsenal, however, will be banking on their own red-hot marksman Alexis Sanchez to continue his fine run of form to give them the edge after the Chilean forward took his tally to 10 goals in six matches with a strike against Watford on Saturday. \nWenger believes his team have the right confidence levels after their run of impressive results in the Premier League, including a 3-0 win over Manchester United before the international break and an identical victory over the Hornets. \n\"It is true that (we have delivered big results) before, but we want to do it again because we feel a bit that the pain inflicted (in the Champions League) was a bit by ourselves,\" Wenger told the club website ( www.arsenal.com ). \n\"Maybe subconsciously we thought 'anyway we will win these (first two games) ',\" the Frenchman added. \n\"Now to correct that, we need a great performance. What we want to do is play up to our level -- that will be needed because we play against a big team. \n\"The confidence level is there, the needed result is there as well -- we know exactly what is required (because) a 0-0 is not even a good result. To score goals, we have to attack.\" Source: Â© Copyright 2015 Reuters Limited. All rights reserved.
