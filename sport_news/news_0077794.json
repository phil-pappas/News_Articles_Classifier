(AP) - A teacher charged with violating state law by cheating on state assessments has had her hearing rescheduled again.\nThe Mississippi Department of Education is seeking to revoke Tetra Winters' license.\nWinters, a teacher at the Heidelberg Elementary School in Clarksdale, was scheduled for a hearing Tuesday before the Commission on Teacher and Administrator Education, Certification and Licensure and Development. The hearing will now be Nov. 16.\nState officials said earlier this month that when students in 2013 took a state assessment, Winters coached them or altered or interfered with their answers. It also says she failed to report violations of testing procedures.\nThe state education department requested a continuance to accommodate the schedules of expert witnesses.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
