Whenever we play against each other, it's always exciting. It's always a huge challenge,\" Djokovic said. \n\"But I was ready. I came in from the very first point with the right intensity, played great, on a very high level.\" \nDjokovic broke Murray five times as the Briton struggled to control his serve and his temper, double-faulting to yield the first of three breaks in a forgettable first set. \nMurray recovered with a break at the start of the second but crowd noises seemed to distract him when he double-faulted and then lost out in a helter-skelter rally as Djokovic broke back. \n\n- Signs of life - \n\nMurray's sixth double fault put him in deep trouble as he was broken to go 1-3 down, and although he saved a match point at 2-5, a thumping Djokovic backhand saw him off in the next game. \n\"Obviously disappointed with the way I played. I served poorly in the first set especially,\" Murray said. \n\"You can't afford to do that against Novak with the way he's playing just now, the amount of confidence he has in his game, and the conditions over here.\" \nAs they played, Tsonga was already celebrating one of his biggest wins this year, while Nadal was happy to see signs of life in his game after a disappointing season. \n\"I was there until the end. Was not (my) day to win. I just need to adjust a little bit a few more things. But in general I have to be happy,\" Nadal said. \nThe Spaniard's serve had only been broken once all week but Tsonga finally pierced his armour in the fifth game with a smoking backhand winner before he totted up a one-set lead. \nBut Tsonga was all at sea in the second set and with double-faults at critical moments, Nadal broke three times to 'bagel' the Frenchman 6-0 and level the match. \nTsonga regathered himself for a tight deciding set and he broke for 6-5 when Nadal fired into the net. \nServing for the match, Tsonga dived full-length for a forehand volley and then got up to parry the scrambling Nadal's reply and bring up match point, which the Spaniard lost tamely. \n\"I will play against a very good player. I know it's going to be difficult. But it's for me an opportunity to hold a new trophy anyway because I'm in final,\" Tsonga said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:27:09.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
