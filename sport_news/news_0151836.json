We have to find a way. \n\"Last season West Brom deservedly won here, their game plan was good, they stopped us and got two set-play goals. \n\"We need to have leaned from that, I hope we have and can get ourselves a victory for our fans.\" \nPardew expects the Baggies to respond following the disappointment of losing at home to Everton on Monday night in a match they had led 2-0. \n\"West Brom are well organised, well disciplined, all of the team have to defend, that is a requirement under Tony,\" he said. \n\"Therefore the distances between the units are not big and it is hard to get through, also they have good knowledge and experienced players with a good management team, so it will be tough.\" \nPalace have acquitted themselves well so far this season, notably with a well-earned victory at Chelsea, and are one of several teams concertinaed just behind the leading Manchester clubs following the 1-0 win away to Watford last weekend. \nPardew held a training session at Selhurst Park this week, and is hoping his team can enjoy some home comforts again in Saturday's early televised kick off. \n\"Alongside most of the Premier League at the moment there are more away wins than home wins, which is strange really, but it will correct itself and we hope to be part of that,\" said Pardew, whose side lost to both Arsenal and Manchester City in SE25 this season. \n\"I have never used counter-attacking tactics, we always just try to win the game. \n\"Sometimes, especially away from home against the top teams, and even at home at times, the territory becomes the opposition's. \n\"We always try to boss the game, like we did at Watford and I don't think we got much credit for that victory. \n\"I was really pleased with that victory, it was a great step for us. \n\"Next we come up against West Brom and depending on when the goals are scored, we should dominate the game. \n\"We have had a really tough start, so the points' total we have is very good, but now we have to build on that.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:36:32.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
