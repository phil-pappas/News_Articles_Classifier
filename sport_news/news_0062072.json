The biggest noise intruder in the test-driven iM was the four-cylinder engine that droned and sounded strained when hard-pressed to accelerate.\nThe car's interior surfaces look good, with plastic that's nicely textured and, in many places, soft when pressed on.\nThe fabric seats have sharp-looking upholstery with accent stitching. The steering wheel comes standard with leather trim. Neither is expected at this price.\nThe best seats are the front buckets, which provided good, firm support on four-plus-hour drives.\nPassengers in the iM back seat sit theater style — higher than the front-seat riders — on a flat, cushioned bench.\nBut there's an unexpectedly generous amount of headroom back there — 37.5 inches so the high seat position doesn't make headroom feel cramped.\nEight cupholders are at the ready and there are many cubbies for storage.\nThe rear seatbacks split 60/40 and fold flat to maximize cargo space, which measures 20.8 cubic feet when the rear seats are in use.\nOn the outside, the iM has an upscale shape and styling similar to that of the CT200h from Toyota's luxury Lexus line.\nBut truth is, the iM is closest to the looks of the Toyota Auris — a hatchback sold in countries around the world but not the U.S.\nThe test-driven iM's fuel economy was disappointing. With the vast majority of driving done on highways, the car averaged only 30.2 mpg for a range of 422 miles.\nThe federal government rates the iM with CVT at 28 mpg in city driving and 37 mpg on the highway.\nAt today's prices for regular gasoline, it cost less than $33 to fill the 14-gallon tank.\nA final note: The iM has a new sedan sibling, the iA, which also is arriving in Scion dealerships for the 2016 model year.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:51:24.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
