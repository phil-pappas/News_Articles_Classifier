We must protect UEFA,” he told the Die Zeit newspaper. \nThe 60-year-old Platini denies any wrongdoing and is appealing his ban. \nHours before UEFA’s meeting began Prince Ali bin Hussein, Platini’s main rival to succeed Blatter, formally registered his candidacy for next year’s election to run FIFA. The Jordanian royal’s potential opponents include Brazilian legend Zico, Liberia’s Musa Bility and South African Tokyo Sexwale, an anti-apartheid campaigner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:06:38.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
