The Baltimore Ravens had high hopes that receiver Breshad Perriman would take the place of deep threat Torrey Smith this season. However, things haven’t worked out according to plan, and now the rookie, who hasn’t yet played a single down for Baltimore, is reportedly out indefinitely following knee surgery.\nAdChoices Ian Rapoport of NFL Network has the scoop .\n#Ravens WR Breshad Perriman reinjured his PCL pregame on Sunday, source said. Dr. Andrews did the arthroscopic surgery. Out indefinitely\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 1, 2015\nIt’s not yet known if the Ravens will put Perriman on the IR or short-term IR, but regardless of that outcome, it seems clear his impact this year will be either nil or minimal.\nThankfully for Baltimore, veteran Steve Smith Jr. is still playing like he’s 25. That said, there isn’t another receiver on the roster who can stretch the field in the way the Ravens were hoping Perriman would. It’s a tough blow for a team that is already 0-3.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/649657697869107200", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ravens?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:33:22.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
