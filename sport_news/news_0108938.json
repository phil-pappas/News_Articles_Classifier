But, facing fourth down at their own 2 with less than a minute to play, the Redhawks had quarterback Andrew Bortnick run through the back of the end zone for a safety rather than punt away. \nAfter the ensuing kick, Brattleboro took the ball at the CVU 35. With two seconds remaining, Taylor King’s 37-yard field goal was blocked –– and run in by a Brattleboro player for a touchdown, but called back for an inadvertent whistle. \nThe referees decided to re-do the down and King’s second attempt came up just short. \nBrad Reynolds got CVU on the board with a 61-yard touchdown run in the second quarter to halve the Brattleboro (4-5) lead to 14-7. Bortnick hit Sam Mikell early in the fourth quarter for a 20-yard TD pass that made it a one-point contest, 14-13. \nCheick Diakite paced the Colonels with 30 rushes for 148 yards and a score. \n• (1) Rutland 46, (8) Mount Anthony 13: Andy Kenosh tossed two touchdown passes and ran for another in the first half as host Rutland routed Mount Anthony for the program’s first postseason win since 2009. \nKenosh threw TD passes to Austin Gorman (35 yards) and Cam Slade (4 yards) before sneaking from 2 yards out before the intermission break. Kenosh also hooked up with Trajan McGee for 37 yards. \nCaleb White, in rushing for over 100 yards, scored on TD runs of 2, 5 and 8 yards for the Raiders (8-1). \nNorm Normyle tossed a 75-yard TD pass to Will Fischer and Pat Powers had a 65-yard scoring run to account for MAU’s offense. \n• (3) Hartford 20, (6) Colchester 0: Brett MacLaren’s 73-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter was the insurance host Hartford needed as it held on for a shutout win over Colchester. \nMacLaren finished with 119 yards on 12 carries for the Hurricanes (7-2). Bryce Landon went 2-for-6 for 54 yards in the air, including a 22-yard TD strike to Codi Smith (three catches, 94 yards). Hunter Judd added 77 yards on the ground and Walkker Judd recorded 66 yards on 10 carries. \nColchester finishes its season 4-5. \nDIVISION III \n• (2) U-32 69, (7) Springfield 0: Storming its way to more than 400 yards rushing, host U-32 scored its first playoff win since 2006 in a rout of Springfield. \nColby Brochu spearheaded the attack with four touchdowns on 146 yards rushing. Zach Schneider had two touchdowns and a team-high 194 yards on the ground, Devin Hanson added a pair of scores, and Logan Wedge and Ian Voyar also rumbed in for TDs. \nU-32 improves to 7-1 while the Cosmos finish 3-6. \n• (3) Woodstock 38, (6) Oxbow 33: Host Woodstock gobbled up an Oxbow fumble inside the red zone with less than a minute to play to seal victory. \nIn a seesaw contest, the Wasps (6-2) opened up a 20-14 halftime lead. Ezra Astbury led the way with 25 carries for 206 yards and two scores. Patrick Potter was close behind with 16 rushes for 183 yards and two touchdowns, while Dan Robinson also scored twice. \nDametres Perry paced the Olympians with 10 carries for 114 yards and two TDs while going 12-for-21 passing for 200 yards, two scores and an interception. Nick Daigle finished with four catches for 95 yards and a touchdown. 9 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://bfpne.ws/1LTutsi TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:28:27.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
