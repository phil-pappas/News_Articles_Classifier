Wilson also led the Seahawks with 78 yards rushing in that game. Basically, Wilson was pretty good for Seattle in the 10-point loss. \nThen there's Kaepernick, who wasn't good at all in the 49ers 17-3 loss to Green Bay on Sunday . As a matter of fact Kaepernick was so bad that the Packers made sure to tell him that he's not as good as Wilson. \n“You ain't Russell Wilson!” Packers players sound off on Colin Kaepernick. #GBvsSF http://t.co/WFZcDZBf05 \n— NFL (@NFL) October 5, 2015 Yes. That's someone yelling, \"You aint Russell Wilson, bro.\"\nSo who yelled it?\nIt looks like it's Clay Matthews , who literally took his mouthpiece out just a split second before the comment was made. \nMatthews yelling the Wilson comment would also make sense because he was ripping Kaepernick the entire game. After a third quarter sack, Matthews did a little \"Kaepernicking.\"\nClay Matthews with the SACK on Colin Kaepernick. Clay Matthews with the Colin Kaepernick celebration. #SAVAGE pic.twitter.com/Z629qTkB5c \n— Green Bay Packers ™ (@titletownpack) October 4, 2015 As things turned out, Matthews was right: Kaepernick wasn't anywhere near as good as Russell Wilson. The 49ers' quarterback only threw for 160 yards during Sunday's loss. Kaepernick also threw an interception. Colin Kaepernick had a few issues with Clay Matthews on Sunday.
