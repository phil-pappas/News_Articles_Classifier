Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, other cabinet ministers, Chief Secretary and bureaucrats also participated in the rally. Kejriwal rode bicycle from Red Fort to Bhagwan Das Marg and appealed to participants to make bicycle-riding a habit. \"People should leave their vehicles and use public transport. Since pollution is increasing in Delhi, there is a need to run cycle which is also good for health,\" he said. The chief minister said he is a diabetic and riding bicycle benefits his health. He called on people to make Delhi's roads safer and said his government is working on a project to redesign them. Car-Free Day, a concept of State Transport Minister Gopal Rai, is being organised today between Red Fort and Bhagwan Das Marg and it will continue till 12 noon. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:27:33.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
