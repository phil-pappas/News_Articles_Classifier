Goals change games and Rushall had to play a little differently once we’d scored. \n\"I always felt we had more threat going forward and we were a little more polished. \n“It was a great performance from us – we knew it was going to be tough against Rushall, and I’m absolutely delighted in front of a big crowd.” \nRushall went close through Jamie Spencer early on and with a Jack Duggan volley in the closing minutes. \nBut Pics boss Richard Sneekes was disappointed with the lack of efforts on goal by his team. \nSneekes stated that he didn’t think his side were ‘good enough’ and that the free kick was a soft goal to concede. \nHe said: “I think it was a game where not a lot happened to be fair. I thought they probably had the better chance in the first half to go 2-0 up. \n“We huffed and puffed in the second-half but, overall, I didn’t think we were good enough on the day to even take them back to Dales Lane. \n“It was one of those games were we never got going, we didn’t really compete, we were too far off second balls.” \nRichards’ goal proved decisive in front of a packed crowd of 773 at Amblecote. \nThe visitors started brightly though, and could have gone ahead within the first few minutes. \nA clever ball over the top of defence from Aris Christophorou found Spencer, on loan from Kidderminster Harriers, whose lob hit the bar. What do you think? Be the first to comment \nThe Pics were left to rue that miss minutes later when Lait was brought down on the edge of the area after cutting in from the left. \nRichards stepped up and lifted the ball over the wall and into the corner of the net to put the home side ahead, with under 10 minutes on the clock.
