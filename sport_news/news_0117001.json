It's kind of a test it and see how it responds.\"\nLevy practiced on a limited basis all week and was originally listed as doubtful on the Lions' official injury report.\nBackup offensive tackle Corey Robinson also did not travel to Seattle and will miss Monday's game against the Seahawks with a sprained ankle.\nThe Seahawks (1-2) downgraded running back Marshawn Lynch and defensive tackle Brandon Mebane from questionable to out earlier today, and added Bruce Irvin (ankle) to the injury report as questionable.\nThe Lions (0-3) are the only winless team remaining in the NFL after the New Orleans Saints beat the Dallas Cowboys in overtime Sunday night.\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.
