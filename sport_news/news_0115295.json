The Zebras have already won as many games this fall as they have in the last five years combined. New Brunswick is off to a 5-0 start for the first time since 2005 and in sole possession of first place atop the White Division. Sofilkanich is a defensive whiz and has also maximized the productivity of offensive playmakers Maurice Ffrench, Samad Davila and Jah’bree Jeffery-Seawright. Mohammed Bangura and German Pimentel anchor a stalwart defense. GMC football statistical leaders (rushing, passing, receiving) \nOffensive Player of the Midseason: Maurice Ffrench, New Brunswick The senior running back, who has committed to the University of Pittsburgh, is the conference’s leading rusher with 745 yards and the league’s second-leading receiver with 311 yards. Ffrench put on a performance for the ages with 401 all-purpose yards and by locking down league-leading receiver Quaasim Glover in last weekend’s 32-20 victory over Woodbridge. \nDefensive Player of the Midseason: Solomon Manning, Colonia The senior linebacker, who has committed to Rutgers University, ranks 17th in the state, according to MaxPreps.com, with 59 tackles. Manning averages 11.8 tackles per game. \nComeback Player of the Midseason: Trevor Firgau, Metuchen A broken collarbone limited Firgau to just six games last season. He unselfishly moved from quarterback, where he split time behind center with Jake Lebovits, to running back to fill a huge void in Metuchen’s offense. Firgau is currently the conference’s fourth-leading rusher. His 600 yards and seven touchdowns on 78 carries tops the Blue Division. The Bulldogs (4-1) are ranked No. 10 in the Home News Tribune Top 10. \nRookie of the Midseason: Artur Sitkowski, Old Bridge The sophomore quarterback, who holds offers from Rutgers and Maryland, completed just 2 of 7 passes in mop-up duty last season. He has completed 42 of 83 attempts (.506 percent) for 635 yards and seven touchdowns with just one interception for a 99.2 quarterback rating. At 6-foot-4, 205 pounds, Sitkowski’s frame appears better-suited for a pocket-passing scheme, but he is surprisingly mobile in Old Bridge’s triple-gun, having rushed 37 times. \nTop Newcomer: James Stewart, Edison The junior running back has rushed for 688 yards (third in the conference) and six touchdowns to complement dual-threat quarterback Haaziq Daniels. \nBest Game of the Midseason: Edison 28, East Brunswick 26 (3OT) The Eagles’ triple overtime victory over the Bears in a Nor’easter was an absolute thriller. Check out Greg Tufaro’s game story . \nBest Team of the Midseason: Piscataway The Chiefs (4-0), ranked No. 1 in the Home News Tribune Top 10, have outscored opponents 148 to 41 and outgained them 1,358 to 660 in yards from scrimmage. Piscataway is a perfect 13 of 13 in red-zone scoring opportunities. They have forced 10 turnovers without losing a fumble or throwing an interception. Piscataway has had 18 plays of 20 yards or longer, is outscoring opponents 65-0 in the first quarter, is averaging 339 yards per game and is starting drives on average at its own 42 yard line. Linebacker Aidan Rosa (25 tackles) leads the Chiefs’ defense. Placekicker Michael Stalenyj booted a single-game school record three field goals in a 37-6 victory over Edison (splitting the uprights on kicks of 40, 35 and 22 yards). In a season-opening win over East Brunswick, Marcel Mason set a school record with a 91-yard punt return. \nSurprise Team of the Midseason: South Plainfield The Tigers graduated two key starters from a team that finished with a deceptive 4-6 record a year ago including three losses by a total of 10 points. Despite the absence of Kyle Dickerson, who amassed 1,088 all-purpose yards last season, and team-leading tackler Johnny Chillemi, who was also one of the state’s most gifted receivers, the Tigers are off to a 3-1 start. South Plainfield is one of just two teams currently ranked in the Home News Tribune Top 10 who did not begin the year ranked. The Tigers, led by Jason Lee (510 rushing yards) are currently No. 8 in the Home News Tribune Top 10. \nBest Program of the Midseason: South Brunswick Based on their consistency and recent success, the Vikings appear to have wrestled that title away from perennial power Piscataway, even though the top-ranked Chiefs are currently ranked ahead of the second-ranked Vikings. That debate will be settled on the field Oct. 30, provided both teams win out until their regular-season meeting, which would then decide the Red Division championship. The Vikings have qualified for the postseason six times since 2007, the year South Brunswick ended a 30-year playoff drought. South Brunswick has reached the sectional final in 2014 and in 2012, splitting with Manalapan for the crown. The Vikings have fashioned a 49-12 record since 2010 including a 4-1 start this season. Phil Campbell and Mohamed Jabbie have already committed to Rutgers University, while the Scarlet Knights are recruiting teammate Justin Shorter. Chrisjon Summers, among the state’s top linebackers, is the team’s most unheralded players. South Brunswick’s only loss came in the season-opener when it squandered a 21-6 lead to Middletown South, which some regard as the top team in New Jersey. \nMost Improved Player of the Midseason: Mario Nigro, South River The senior transitioned from running back to quarterback as the Rams abandoned their pro-style offense in favor of a spread attack. Nigro has amassed 1,106 all-purpose yards including 495 through the air, 438 on the ground and 166 return yards for the winless Rams (0-5). He mustered 483 all-purpose yards last season. \nSpecial Teams Player of the Midseason: Jake Esposito, Old Bridge Esposito has proved to be among the state’s most dangerous return specialists. He has returned five kicks for 198 yards and five punts for 128 yards, totaling 326 return yards. Esposito is averaging 39.6 yards per kick return and 25.6 yards per punt return. He has returned a kickoff 87 yards for a score and a punt 64 yards for a score. \nUnsung Hero of the Midseason: Josh Liao, South Brunswick Unlike last season, when 90 percent of South Brunswick’s offensive plays were on the ground, the Vikings have taken to the air with greater frequency this year. Liao has already attempted and completed more passes — he is 38 of 67 — for more yards (655) than South Brunswick threw for all of last season (524). South Brunswick has rushed 151 times for 845 yards, well off its pace of 417 carries for 3,059 yards of a year ago when Dontae Strickland (now at Syracuse University) was the feature back. Credit the coaching staff for still running the triple option, but playing to the team’s strengths by throwing the ball to the likes of Wendell Allen, Mohamed Jabbie and Justin Shorter. Credit Liao for his ability to throw the deep pass and make great decisions. He has also rushed 22 times for 161 yards and two scores. Liao learned on the fly last year, filling in exceptionally well for injured starter Amir Johnson while leading the Vikings to wins over Monroe, Edison and Piscataway. He completed just 9 of 18 passes last season. \nBest Two-Way Player of the Midseason: Elijah Barnwell The Piscataway junior has rushed for 701 yards, which ranks second in the conference and tops the Red Division. He needs just 14 yards to become the school’s career rushing leader. Barnwell currently has 2,834 career yards, behind school record-holder Tevin Shaw’s 2,848. Barnwell, who has a scholarship offer from Rutgers University, is second on the Chiefs in tackles. \nBiggest Factor for the Second Half of the Season Look for running back Luke Yakely (411 rushing yards) and quarterback Paul Coccoziello (483 passing yards) of St. Joseph to make the biggest impact in the second half of the season. The young Falcons, who were ranked No. 5 in the preseason Top 10, fell out of the rankings with a lopsided season-opening loss to South Plainfield, but have played up to their ability since. St. Joseph has steadily improved and has the potential to make some noise in the White Division down the stretch, despite a difficult slate. They close out the regular season against Carteret, Colonia, Woodbridge, New Brunswick and Bishop Ahr. 46 CONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LustXt TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:17:10.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
