One applies to the running back position.\nIt's a rule Quinn Julian attempts to follow every day.\n\"We always want to get north and south. Yards horizontal don't matter, but north and south wins games,\" Julian said.\nAt 6-foot and 170 pounds, Julian, a senior, does not fit the prototype of a between-the-tackles runner. In the Scouts' zone-based running scheme — where linemen block a gap as opposed to a man — Julian's lack of size isn't a problem as long as he follows his rules.\n\"Coaches stress one cut and live with it. They don't want us dancing in the backfield,\" he said. \"Plant your foot and take what you can.\"\nJulian has been taking chunks of yardage this season.\nThrough the Scouts' first six games, Julian has 898 combined rushing and receiving yards (433 rushing, 465 receiving). He has found the end zone 18 times. Offensive coordinator Phil DeWald often calls Julian's number on delayed screen passes, or will split him out wide to free up space in the box. With an average of 7.3 yards per rush, he lets his innate creativity and natural speed take over after his initial cut.\n\"He doesn't look like a menacing bruiser,\" coach Chuck Spagnoli said. \"His opportunities come when he sees a seam, runs through it and outruns people. He sees what's in front of him and reacts better than most.\"\nSenior wide receiver Brian Doherty added: \"With his versatility, physical gifts and cutting and vision, we are confident putting him anywhere.\"\nA track athlete in the spring, Julian runs the 100- and 200-meter sprints and sprint relays. The shorter distances translate well to football as bursts of speed are more essential to beating would-be tacklers in the open field.\nThat's where Julian is most effective. Space allows his improvisational artistry to take over a game.\n\"Our coaches say, 'Don't be a robot, be a football player.' Once I get through that first line, they let me live with it. I have more freedom,\" Julian said. \"I might see something they don't see. The field is always changing.\"\nLake Forest (4-2, 1-2 North Suburban Lake) hosts defending Class 8A state champion Stevenson on Friday, Oct. 9. The matchup features two teams going in opposite directions — the Scouts have won two in a row while the Patriots have lost two in a row. On paper, it looks like it will be a high-scoring game.\nLake Forest has scored 101 points in its past two games and averages 37.5 points per game. The defense has struggled against teams with records at .500 or better, allowing 31.5 points per game. Stevenson is 3-3 on the season and runs a spread offense that averages 24.5 points.\n\"What a great opportunity for our team and our community to bring in a defending state champion,\" Spagnoli said. \"I'm sure they will be excited to play us.\"\nDoherty added: \"We don't need any added motivation for Stevenson. We know they are a really good team and we look forward to playing them and building confidence and momentum and make a run to the playoffs.\"\nJon J.
