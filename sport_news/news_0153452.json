Madrid organised an event on Friday to laud the 30-year-old’s performances and Perez underlined Ronaldo’s importance to the club. “Real Madrid are a club that aim to achieve the impossible and giants like Cristiano Ronaldo make it happen,” Perez was quoted as saying by goal.com on Friday as Ronaldo, his family, team-mates and head coach Rafa Benitez looked on. “Cristiano, the fans at Real Madrid love and admire you. They all know how much you mean to this club. You are a legend at the club that has won 10 European titles, he said. The Real president also indicated his belief that the deflected goal against Sociedad does count in Ronaldo’s goal tally, suggesting that the forward has already overtaken Raul and reached 324 goals. “He is our all-time top goal scorer and the best player in the world,” Perez said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:28:32.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
