Three New Jersey men were busted on charges that they were selling drugs out of a local discount store, authorities said.\nThe trio — Clifton Darby, 46, Fabian Daniels, 51, and James Harris, 48 — were arrested after cops caught them working rotating shifts to sell drugs in front of a 99 Cent Zone store on Clinton Ave. in Newark, authorities said.\nThey were busted Wednesday, after investigators with the Essex County Sheriff’s Office monitored the alleged sales during a surveillance operation at the store.\nA team of cops burst into the store to collar the suspects — but then Darby ran into a fortified back room.\n\"It took a full five minutes to ram the door open,” Sheriff Armando Fontoura said in a statement.\n\"All the while our officers could hear the continuous flushing of a toilet.\"\nWhen the officers gained access to the back room, they saw Darby flushing what appeared to be narcotics — but found 27 small bags of marijuana, along with drug packaging and processing paraphernalia, authorities said.\nFontoura also said Darby was found to be in possession of five envelopes of heroin.\nThe three men were each charged with various counts of possession with intent to distribute, conspiracy, maintenance of fortified premises and possession of narcotics paraphernalia.
