Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports Ben Roethlisberger reportedly wants to be in the lineup Sunday so he can face former offensive coordinator Bruce Arians and the Arizona Cardinals. And while the Pittsburgh Steelers are not specifically ruling out the possibility that their franchise quarterback has healed sufficiently from a sprained MCL and bone bruise to take the field, sources have deemed the likelihood of it actually occurring as a “long shot.”\nAdChoices ESPN’s Adam Schefter provided the original update regarding Roethlisberger’s eagerness to return to action, which conflicted with CBS Sports’ Jason La Canfora’s reporting that indicated the quarterback was targeting Oct. 25’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs as a realistic return date.\nRoethlisberger suffered the injury during Pittsburgh’s 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Rams on Sept. 27. The original prognosis was that he would miss between four and six weeks, so if he was somehow able to return to action so quickly, it would be a testament to his legendary toughness combined with quick recuperative powers, although it is believed he will be wearing a knee brace upon his return.\nGiven his previous comments about his anticipated return to action, it’s unlikely Roethlisberger will provide any definitive answers regarding when he’ll be back on the field, as he previously refuted reports he was shooting to be in the lineup for the aforementioned game against the Chiefs, saying, “Rather than put a number on it, lets just take it one week at a time.”\nThe Steelers have held their own in Roethlisberger’s absence, going 2-1, including the win over the Rams in the game he was injured. A stern test awaits the team, though, against Arians' formidable Cardinals squad, but it would be a risky endeavor indeed for Roethlisberger to hurry himself back into action solely to play his former coordinator.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25338152/report-ben-roethlisberger-wants-to-face-cardinals-arians-on-sunday", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13874166/ben-roethlisberger-pittsburgh-steelers-pushing-sunday-return-sources-say"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:18:40.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
