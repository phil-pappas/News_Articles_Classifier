Photo: Getty Images\nThat is when the Parramatta Eels' backline ace announced a far-fetched goal of playing in the NFL, so each day he straps on his San Francisco 49ers helmet and pads to practice or play Hayne is living a dream.\nAdvertisement \"No, for me it's about going out there and learning and being grateful to get the opportunity to be out there and learn the game,\" Hayne told reporters on Tuesday, when asked if he was frustrated by the lack of opportunities.\nHayne was the 49ers' first back-up option for star running back Carlos Hyde against the Ravens on Sunday, but for the nine plays he was on the field quarterback Colin Kaepernick didn't hand or pass him the ball.\nHayne's only touch in the 49ers' 25-20 win against the Ravens on Sunday came on a punt return and it was a near-disaster when an opponent knocked it out of his hands.\nLuckily a team-mate scooped it up.\nIt was Hayne's third fumble in six regular season games.\nBall possession is key in the NFL and 49ers coaches have been on Hayne to call a fair catch on punts to kill the play if he doesn't have open space to run.\nHayne was surrounded by Ravens, caught the punt and took off toward the middle of the field.\n\"I know it was a risky play,\" he said.\n\"I fended someone off and I just should have had more ball security.\n\"It's one of those plays where I'm trying to get extra yards where obviously protecting the ball is more the key thing.\"\nThe 49ers play the most crucial game of their season on Thursday when they host the Seattle Seahawks, their bitter NFC West division rivals who also have a two-win, four-loss record.\nThe loser will likely have their playoff hopes extinguished.\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:38:55.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
