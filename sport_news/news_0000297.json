And they have done today - not so much the opponent, but definitely the referee. \n''I have seen lots of challenges like that in the game, in every game and, outside the box, they are never given. It's a double whammy - a penalty and 10 men. It made it very difficult. \n''We need an experienced referee for this and I think he was a little too quick to make a decision.'' \nAnother d efender, Daryl Janmaat, called the decision \"crazy\". \nHe said: \"I think we were by far the better team in the first half, and then we get a red card like this - it was unbelievable. \n\"I don't like to blame referees, but that was not a penalty. I think everybody saw it and a red card is crazy, in my opinion. \n\"It kills the game. I don't like excuses, but I think we had 70 per cent possession in the first half and were far better than them. In the second half, we lost the game with 10 men. \n\"It's disappointing because in the first half, we played well.\" \nAsked if the incident should have resulted in either a penalty or a red card, Janmaat said: \"I don't think so. I think it was nothing. It's a contact sport.\" \nIf Newcastle felt hard done by, there was an acknowledgement too that they had failed to make the most of the early pressure they exerted with Sunderland never really in it until the penalty incident. \nColoccini, Jack Colback and Georginio Wijnaldum had all forced saves from Costel Pantilimon, who later kept them in front with a vital stop from Aleksandar Mitrovic, before Billy Jones and Fletcher got the goals which put the game beyond the Magpies. \nJanmaat added: \"We had some good chances and we needed to score. We were far better. That's what's so disappointing. We didn't deserve it.\" \nThe Magpies slipped back to 19th place in the table on goal difference as Sunderland leapfrogged them - with both clubs having collected just six points from their opening 10 games.
