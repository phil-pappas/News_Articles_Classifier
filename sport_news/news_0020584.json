Online gallery at herald-review.com/gallery \nMOUNT ZION -- Mount Zion accomplished something Friday night it couldn't last season against Effingham. \nOn a third-and-short late in the third quarter, the Braves stopped Effingham twice on running plays to force a turnover on downs. \nThe excitement when the defense came back to the sideline rivaled that of any of the six touchdowns the Braves scored in their 42-20 win to wrap up a playoff spot with their sixth win. \n\"We needed that,\" Mount Zion coach Mike Popovich said. \"We needed to have a gut check and make those stops. We needed the confidence that gave us.\" \nEven with a new coach and few players back from Effingham's team from last year, the game plan for the Hearts against Mount Zion was the same -- overpower the Braves with their run game. \nIn the first quarter, it worked. After Mount Zion had taken a 6-0 lead on a 54-yard pass from Brandon Price to Charles Kuhle, the Hearts marched down and scored on two straight possessions -- one ending in a Hudson Graham 1-yard touchdown run and the other on a 35-yard TD run by fullback Terrence Hill. \nBut Mount Zion (6-2, 3-2 Apollo Conference) regained the lead on a Price 2-yard touchdown run and a 58-yard slip screen pass to Sammy Schultz, taking a 20-13 lead at half. Effingham had just one more scoring drive the rest of the game. \n\"Our coach (defensive coordinator Brit Miller) pulled us over to the side at halftime and we just talked about things,\" Mount Zion junior Peyten Chappel said. \"We made some little adjustments -- nothing big. We just talked about what they'd done and keyed on the things we needed to do to make plays.\" \nPrice, who started just his third game at quarterback, was too much for the Hearts to stop. He passed for 264 yards and two touchdowns and also rushed for 160 yards and three scores. \n\"He's good,\" Popovich said. \"He's a player. He's the type of kid -- like (Jack) Hockaday was at Maroa and (Nick) Bates at Tuscola -- who if you put something around him, he's a difference-maker. And we have the guys around him.\" Justin's take Responding \nPopovich told Chappel before the game: \"You're the best player in this conference and you need to play like it. You need to play like an all-stater.\" \nEffingham had the first possession of the second half, still down just a touchdown. But on second and third down plays, big hits by Chappel stalled the Hearts' drive and forced a punt. Breaking through \nThe win was the first for the Braves against Effingham in Popovich's three seasons as coach after losing heartbreakers the first two seasons. \nThe Hearts fell to 3-5, 2-3 and were eliminated from playoff contention, but they'd previously played Apollo champion Taylorville within a touchdown and Mattoon within three points in losses. \n\"That's a good football team,\" Popovich said. \"They've gotten better every week. (New coach Brett Hefner) does a great job -- we're going to have problems with them down the road. \n\"But after the way we've lost to them the last two years, this feels good. I could argue that this is the most quality win we've had.\" Satisfying \nPrice was outstanding in his first two games at quarterback, completing 26 of 29 passes for 468 yards and seven touchdowns, plus a 196-yard rushing performance last week vs. Salem. \nBut Friday's performance meant a little more to Price. \n\"The first two games ... I'm not trying to dog those teams, but it was pretty easy,\" Price said. \"This was the test -- we knew it would be. So this feels good.\" \njconn@herald-review.com|(217) 421-7971", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:52:33.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
