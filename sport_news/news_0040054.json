Green Bay. The Packers are 2-0 and play three of their next four games at home, where they have not lost since December 2013.\n2. New England. The 2-Â­0 Patriots have more than just Tom Brady. New England leads the NFL in sacks on defense with 11 in two games.\n3. Denver. The 2Â­-0 Broncos lead the AFC in defense and that defense delivered gameÂ­winning touchdowns in each of the first two games -- an interception against Baltimore and a fumble against KC.\n4. Arizona. Carson Palmer has thrown 56 passes this season for the unbeaten Cardinals without taking a sack.\n5. Cincinnati. The only other quarterback who has avoided a sack through two games is Andy Dalton, who has thrown 60 passes this season for the Bengals without hitting the turf.\n6. Atlanta. Wide receiver Julio Jones is off to a torrid start for the 2-0 Falcons. He leads the NFL with 22 catches for 276 yards.\n7. Dallas. The Cowboys are 2-0 on the field but 0-2 in the training room, having lost QB Tony Romo and WR Dez Bryant for what could be the next two months with injuries.\n8. Carolina. The most important stat in defensive football is points allowed -- and the 2-0 Panthers have allowed an NFC-Â­low 26 points this season.\n9. Pittsburgh. The Steelers lead the NFL in offense through two weeks and Ben Roethlisberger is on fire. He's the only NFL quarterback to open the season with a pair of 300-Â­yard passing games.\n10. NY Jets. It's no secret why the Jets are unbeaten through two weeks. They have forced a league-Â­high 10 turnovers. Defense wins championships.\n11. San Diego. The Chargers are 1Â­-1 but lead the NFL in giveaways with six. Philip Rivers has thrown three interceptions and lost a fumble.\n12. Miami. The Dolphins gave Ndamukong Suh a $114 million contract in free agency but haven't gotten bang for their buck yet. Miami only has one sack this season.\n13. Kansas City. Pro Bowl pass rusher Justin Houston has an NFL-Â­runnerup three sacks and the Chiefs rank second in the league with eight sacks.\n14. St. Louis. The 1Â­-1 Rams have the youngest starting lineup in the NFL with an average age of 25.31 years. That's almost two years younger than the league average.\n15. Seattle. The winless Seahawks acquired an elite weapon this offseason in Pro Bowl TE Jimmy Graham but seem reluctant to throw to him. He has only seven catches.\n16. Buffalo. Rex Ryan inherited a top 5 defense in Buffalo. But the Bills rank 28th after two weeks. Having Andrew Luck and Tom Brady in the first two weeks was a contributing factor.\n17. Minnesota. The Vikings are 1Â­-1 and now venture into the AFC West, playing their next three games against the Chargers, Broncos and Chiefs.\n18. Baltimore. The NFL schedule-Â­maker dealt five teams a terrible hand -- Baltimore, Detroit, Miami, Seattle and Tennessee -- asking them to open the season with back-Â­to-Â­back road games. Those five teams enter Week 3 a combined 2-Â­8.\n19. Indianapolis. Only three of the 49 Super Bowl champions opened a season 0-2. Super Bowl aspirants Indianapolis, Baltimore and Seattle are all 0Â­2 this season.\n20. Washington. There have been eight individual 100Â­yard rushing games this season and the Redskins have two of them -- by two different backs (Alfred Morris and Matt Jones).\n21. Tennessee. Rookie QB Marcus Mariota didn't throw interceptions in college at Oregon and he's not throwing them now with the Titans. Two NFL starts, six TDs, no interceptions.\n22. San Francisco. The 1-Â­1 49ers rank second in the NFL in rushing on the legs of halfback Carlos Hyde and quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Hyde leads the league with 211 yards.\n23. Oakland. The 1-1 Raiders opened the season with two home games but their defense is still looking for its first sack.\n24. Jacksonville. The Jaguars upset Miami in Week 2 to get to 1-Â­1 but play the next three on the road -- at New England, Indianapolis and Tampa Bay.\n25. Cleveland. The most explosive player in the NFL? It's Travis Benjamin, who has touched the ball 13 times this season on passes and punt returns for 368 yards and four touchdowns -- an average of 28.3 yards per touch.\n26. Tampa Bay. It's going to be a steep learning curve for first overall draft pick Jameis Winston. He has seven sacks and three turnovers in his first two NFL starts.\n27. Detroit. The Lions are struggling because their defense is struggling. They finished second in defense a year ago in an 11-Â­5 season. They rank 30th now in an 0-2 season.\n28. Houston. The Texans have started two different quarterbacks, Brian Hoyer and Ryan Mallett, and lost games with both of them. Too bad George Blanda, Dan Pastorini and Warren Moon aren't still around.\n29. Philadelphia. The winless Eagles can't block. And if you can't block in Chip Kelly's offense, you can't win. Defending NFL rushing champion DeMarco Murray has 11 yards in two games.\n30. NY Giants. The winless Giants have allowed a 300Â­yard passer in each of their first two games, both losses. Tony Romo and then Matt Ryan scorched the New York secondary.\n31. Chicago. The Bears also are winless through two games and now must go to the bench to replace QB Jay Cutler, who figures to miss two games with a hamstring injury. Jimmy Clausen gets the call.\n32. New Orleans. The Saints are another of the winless and could be without their Pro Bowl quarterback Drew Brees for a few weeks with a rotator cuff injury.\nMORE MUST-CLICK COWBOYS CONTENT OPINION, ANALYSIS\nGosselin: Falcons have their own version of Tony Romo, complete with playoff failures\nGosselin: What the Cowboys need to do with Romo out\nMoore: .500 football while Tony Romo is out would exceed expectations\nMoore: Cowboys appear to be really limited in the red zone\nGosselin: A realistic return date for Romo and Bryant\nLaufenberg: Don't panic ... why Cowboys can go 5-3 in next 8 games\nLaufenberg: What the Cowboys MUST do to beat the Atlanta Falcons\nMoore: What makes Sean Lee a linebacking genius\nGosselin: Cowboys-Eagles marred by theater of the absurd, out-of-whack officials\nStephen A.
