Fort Worth Star-Telegram photographer Paul Moseley hurried onto the field to shoot it.\nIt's bigger than a game I love touching young people lives üôèüèΩüê∏ #GodIsBigEnough \nA photo posted by Trevone Boykin (@t2boykin) on Oct 18, 2015 at 11:37am PDT \nWhat followed is captured by Moseley both on film and in his Facebook entry:\n‚ÄúThe TCU captains are there plus a special guest of Iowa State, a little girl in a wheelchair. They toss the coin, all the players come over to see the girl, but one player, TCU QB Boykin, took the time to kneel down and I hear him say, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äô I was incredibly touched. Who but a true champion does that just minutes before a big game?‚Äù\nAfter No. 3 TCU (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) beat the hometown Cyclones 45-21, it was probably a lot easier for the Iowa State faithful to appreciate Boykin‚Äôs Heisman-like performance in torching their team. Boykin completed 27 of 32 passes for 436 yards and four touchdowns without an interception.\nHe also led the Frogs with 74 rushing yards and a fifth touchdown. On the season, Boykin has thrown for 2,539 yards and 25 touchdowns with just five interceptions and has rushed for 440 yards and five touchdowns.\nThe Star-Telegram published this video of Boykin‚Äôs interaction with the little girl and other Iowa State fans.\n  This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .\nFiled under tcu horned frogs ,  trevone boykin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:29:13.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
