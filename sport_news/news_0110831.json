Volquez shut the Blue Jays out across six innings in Game 1, then held them to one run through five innings in Game 5. \nThe one run came on Chris Colabello's solo home run against a rare Volquez mistake -- he hung a changeup in an 0-2 count. Other than that, Volquez limited Toronto to a walk and two singles (one an infield single) through the first five innings of Game 5. He was pretty dominant. \nEven with Marco Estrada dealing -- he faced the minimum through six innings -- Game 5 was uncomfortably close through 5 1/2 innings. The Blue Jays were nursing their 1-0 lead but you could feel the uneasiness in the Rogers Centre crowd. The Blue Jays needed more runs and the fans knew it. \nIn the sixth inning, the Blue Jays got those runs, and they did it by capitalizing on a brief bout of wildness from Volquez. Brief within the context of the ALCS, anyway. Volquez has battled poor location his entire career and it came back to bite him in Game 5 on Wednesday. \nBen Revere started the sixth inning with a seven-pitch walk, then Volquez hit Josh Donaldson with a fastball in the elbow guard. It would have hit him right in the chest had he not brought his arm closer to his body. The hit-by-pitch was unintentional, of course, but intent was not important. The Blue Jays had two on with no outs. \nAs well as he pitched in Game 1 and the first five innings of Game 5, it was getting pretty obvious that Volquez was struggling with his location and entering the danger zone after hitting Donaldson. Jose Bautista worked a hard-fought 10-pitch walk to load the bases, taking several close pitches for balls. Check it out: \nThe Blue Jays managed to load the bases without putting a single ball in play. Two walks and a hit batsman did the trick. Royals manager Ned Yost, who had setup man Kelvin Herrera warming in the bullpen, opted to stick with Volquez. Volquez then walked Edwin Encarnacion on six pitches to force in a run, and none of the four balls were particularly close. \nSo again, the Blue Jays had a run in and the bases loaded with no outs in the sixth, and they still hadn't put a ball in play. Volquez walked three and hit a batter. Only 11 of his 24 pitches in the frame were strikes. Volquez is known to be wild -- he can be dominant one inning and wild the next -- and Toronto was able to take advantage in the sixth inning. \nThe walk to Encarnacion ended Volquez's evening. Herrera came in and eventually allowed a bases-clearing double to Troy Tulowitzki to break the game open . Volquez was charged with five runs in five innings even though he was excellent for the first five innings before losing it in the sixth. He walked four and hit a batter in those five innings, and struck out only two. \nThe Blue Jays extended their season with the Game 5 win ( TOR 7, KC 1 ), and that sixth inning gave them some much needed breathing room. Things were tense early. Volquez opened the door with his wildness in that inning, and the Blue Jays made him and the Royals pay. Game 6 is Friday in Kansas City. \nThe Blue Jays made Edinson Volquez pay for his wildness in the six inning of Game 5.
