For the second straight week, Pittsburg football went on the road and dominated their district opponent. The Purple Dragons traveled to face Blue Valley Southwest, beating the Timberwolves 35-7 Friday evening at the Overland Park Recreational Complex. PHS got the scoring started with a long touchdown run to jump out in front early, taking advantage of a Timberwolves turnover on the first possession of the game. A second score after a Southwest turnover led to a Purple Dragons' cushion. PHS went on to score three more touchdowns in the rout over Southwest. Pittsburg is now 2-0 in district play, staying perfect on the season with an 8-0 record. The Timberwolves had the ball first to start the game and were driving down the field on the Purple Dragons, using the run heavily to move the chains. The first pass attempt of the drive for Southwest – inside the Pittsburg red zone — didn’t go well, as PHS’ Elijah Harris came away with an interception for the game’s first turnover. Like good teams do, Pittsburg took advantage of the change in possession as fullback Dante Menghini burst through a hole up the middle on the way to a 44-yard touchdown run to put the Dragons up 7-0. Pittsburg stretched their lead to two touchdowns after Menghini ran in for a score. Prior to the scoring drive, the Purple Dragons defense forced a second turnover by the Timberwolves when Will Mengarelli stripped the ball from a Southwest runner with Adrian Scroggins falling on it. Menghini — who scored from 5-yards out — added his second touchdown of the game after PHS drove 48 yards in 11 plays to makes the score 14-0 with 8:33 left in the second quarter. The Timberwolves got on the scoreboard just before the half as quarterback Collin Gallery hooked up with wide receiver Carter Gehl for 18 yards and a touchdown with 1:15 left in the second quarter. The BVSW drive went 65 yards on seven plays. The Purple Dragons opened the second half with another big play as quarterback Spencer Turnbull hooked up with wide receiver Chiantia Allen on the outside for a 64-yard touchdown to put PHS up 21-7 with less than a minute off the clock in the third quarter. Turnbull essentially sealed the win for the Purple Dragons after his touchdown on the ground came with 9:34 left in the fourth quarter to put Pittsburg up 28-7 over the Timberwolves. On the very next play from scrimmage on first and 10 from the BVSW 10, Pittsburg’s Allen picked off a Gallery pass and took it to the house for his second defensive touchdown in as many weeks. The score pushed the Purple Dragon lead to 35-7. Turnbull finished the game completing 6-of-9 passes for 100 yards and a score. He added 66 yards and a touchdown on the ground on nine carries. Page 2 of 2 - Menghini led the Purple Dragons in rushing with 72 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries. Running back Sherrick Rogers had 10 carries for 46 yards. Southwest’s Gallery completed 12-of-his-16 passes for 119, a touchdown and two interceptions. Dane Pedersen was the leading rusher for the Timberwolves, gaining 60 yards on 12 carries. UP NEXT Pittsburg wraps up their regular season with a game against St. Thomas Aquinas at 7 p.m. Friday at Hutchinson Field. Lucas Davis is the sports editor of the Pittsburg Morning Sun.
