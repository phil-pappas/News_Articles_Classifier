He was hurt in the first quarter when Jamie Collins tackled Joseph Randle, and both landed hard on Hightower, who never returned to the game.\nThe extent of Hightower's injury is unknown, but it's a positive sign that he was able to practice through it. However, Hightower played through a torn shoulder labrum for two months last season, so he has a proven track record of playing through painful injuries.\nNate Solder, who has a torn biceps and is done for the season, was the only player missing from today's practice.\nThe Patriots practiced in full pads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:54:54.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
