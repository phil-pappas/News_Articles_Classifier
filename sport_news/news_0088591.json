Both are 2-4. (Photo: Associated Press) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \n( CBS SPORTS ) -- The San Francisco 49ers sitting at 2-4 through six games is not necessarily surprising, but not many prognosticators envisioned a 2-4 start for Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks . \nOver the past five years, this rivalry has carried significant weight, and this Thursday Night Football showdown is no different -- even with both teams under .500. \nHere are the five advanced stats you need to know for this key NFC West battle. NFL Today: TNF preview \n1. Calm under pressure \nMost quarterbacks are drastically worse under pressure than when they're comfortably surveying the field from a clean pocket. \nThat's logical. \nBeyond that, continual pressure typically \"ruins\" signal-callers -- as repeated pressure asks for repeated improvisational play and usually accuracy outside the pocket while on the run. \nOf all quarterbacks in the NFL, Russell Wilson is the most acclimated to pressure -- some of the pressure he faces is on him -- and he has been remarkably good with a defender bearing down on him, especially this season. \nCheck out these insane numbers. \nRUSSELL WILSON UNDER PRESSURE \nYEAR UNDER PRESSURE % (RANK) ACCURACY % UNDER PRESSURE (RANK) \n2015 46.8 (1) 77.8 (3) \n2014 46.0 (1) 68.6 (6) \n2013 43.8 (1) 61.9 (11) \n2012 39.2 (2) 66.0 (5) \nSeattle's offensive line hasn't necessarily been a team strength for the past two or three years, and Wilson undoubtedly tends to channel his amazing backyard football skills quicker than others, but his under pressure numbers are outrageous. \nNote that since 2013, he has gotten more accurate in these situations, and while a six-game sample size may be helping his 2015 Accuracy Percentage here, nearly a 10-percentage point jump from a season ago is impressive. \nRussell Wilson is not only elusive, he's very effective under pressure. (Photo: USA TODAY SPORTS IMAGES) \nFor perspective on Wilson's 77.8 percentage: Andrew Luck is currently last in the NFL with an Under Pressure Accuracy Percentage of 47.1. \nAaron Rodgers is at 67.5 percent and Tom Brady is at 68.3. \n2. Carlos Hyde , the NFL's most underrated RB? \nWhen it comes down to it, the fundamental skill that separates running backs is the ability to forced missed tackles -- and maybe avoid them altogether. \nWhile it's extremely hard to decipher how a runner completely \"avoids\" a would-be tackle by making a cut into open space, Pro Football Focus does track when a tackler is there, and a running back forces that tackler to miss. \nThis may be somewhat surprising to some, but 49ers running back Carlos Hyde leads the NFL in missed tackles forced and is second in missed tackles divided by total touches among the top 10 runners in total missed tackles forced and total touches. \nLEADERS IN MISSED TACKLES FORCED \nPLAYER TOTAL TOUCHES MISSED TACKLES FORCED MISSED TACKLE % \nMelvin Gordon 91 26 28.5 \nCarlos Hyde 115 31 26.9 \nLe'Veon Bell 104 21 20.1 \nSource: Pro Football Focus \nAnd it's not like Hyde is running through a parted Red Sea on every snap. In fact, quite the opposite. According to Pro Football Focus, the 49ers have a minus-30.9 cumulative run-blocking score, the second-worst in football. Because of that, it's easy to assume San Francisco's offensive line will have issues with Seattle's ferocious defensive front. \nHowever, even if he's not given massive holes to run through, Hyde should be able showcase his supreme elusiveness. \nBy the way, Marshawn Lynch only has 65 total touches this season -- therefore he didn't qualify for the above chart -- and has forced 18 missed tackles, which puts his missed tackles percentage at 27.6. Safe to say, he's the same old Marshawn Lynch. \n3. Super pass-rushers \nMichael Bennett , Cliff Avril and Aaron Lynch are three of the most effective pass rushers in the NFC. \nBennett is probably the most well-known of the bunch, and he has been a consistent disruptor for years. So has Avril. \nBut check out the jump Lynch has made in his second professional season. \nPRESSURING THE QUARTERBACK \nPLAYER 2014 QB PRESSURES 2015 QB PRESSURES PACE \nMichael Bennett 72 72 \nAaron Lynch 41 74.6 \nSource: Pro Football Focus \nSure, Lynch is seeing the field more than he did as a rookie, but he's nearly doubling his production as the primary stand-in for Aldon Smith , and he doesn't have Justin Smith eating double teams on the interior. \nWhile the amount of top-level talent the 49ers lost this past offseason was astonishing and definitely well-documented, Lynch is emerging as the leader of the new wave of talent in San Francisco. \nHe'll be a handful for the Seahawks' offensive tackles in this one. \nAaron Lynch is emerging as a leader for the 49ers' defense.

Hey, Colin ... throw it to Torrey \nTorrey Smith was brought to the 49ers to stretch the field and give Colin Kaepernick a speedster that would (hopefully) ameliorate the quarterback's effectiveness down the field. \nThus far, Smith has done just that, but he probably needs to see the ball more. Take a look at his production and usage numbers this season compared to the rest of his career. \nTORREY SMITH'S PRODUCTION \n2015 YARDS PER CATCH (RANK) CAREER YARDS PER CATCH CAREER TARGETS PER SEASON 2015 TARGET PACE \nSmith 23.1 (1) 16.8 109 67 \nSource: Pro Football Focus \nAlso, Smith's highest final-season catch percentage is 53, which he had in 2014 with the Ravens. His current catch percentage is 56. \nSo, basically, while the small sample size must be kept in mind, what Smith has accomplished through six games in San Francisco is enough to recommend that he should be a more frequent target in the 49ers passing offense. \n5. Hey, Carlos ... run left \nAs previously mentioned, Hyde is an unheralded, exceptional talent. A lot of his yardage comes when he eludes a tackler or breaks free from a defender. \nDespite issues on the right side of the 49ers' line, the tandem of left tackle Joe Staley and left guard Alex Boone is tremendous, and often paves massive holes for the second-year runner. \nCheck how productive Hyde has been while running behind Staley or Boone in 2015. \nCARLOS HYDE'S PRODUCTION \nCARLOS HYDE CARRIES YARDS YARDS PER CARRY TDS \nBehind Staley and/or Boone 25 179 7.16 2 \nSource: Pro Football Focus \nTalk about efficiency. \nIf anything, it can be argued that Hyde should carry the football left more often, as only 25 percent of his 104 carries on the season have gone directly behind Staley or Boone. \nPrediction: Seahawks 20, 49ers 17 \nThis contest will be closer than expected. The 49ers have big-play potential with Smith, Anquan Boldin is still a reliable chain mover and San Francisco's defensive front seven is underrated. \nIt wouldn't surprise me if Jim Tomsula's club holds a lead in the second half, but the Seahawks will mount a mini comeback and win a close one, with much thanks to Marshawn Lynch's punishing running style, Russell Wilson's improvisational skills and a few stagnant possessions by the 49ers offense late in the game.
