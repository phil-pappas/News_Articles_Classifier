However, since the sale of Luis Saurez Liverpool have struggled to replicate that kind of form. \nThe move comes less than five months after owners Fenway Sports Group gave their backing to the Northern Irishman after a woeful end to the 2014-15 campaign. \n“We would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Brendan Rodgers for the significant contribution he has made to the club and express our gratitude for his hard work and commitment,” owner John Henry, chairman Tom Werner and president Mike Gordon told the clubs website via a joint statement. \n“All of us have experienced some wonderful moments with Brendan as manager and we are confident he will enjoy a long career in the game. \n“Although this has been a difficult decision, we believe it provides us with the best opportunity for success on the pitch. Ambition and winning are at the heart of what we want to bring to Liverpool and we believe this change gives us the best opportunity to deliver it.” \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
