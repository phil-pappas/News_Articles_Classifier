There is no doubt that it is a privilege to be part of such a significant and pathfinding project,” Bitterman said.\nHis appointment was approved by the hospital’s board of directors and will start work in the next few months, even though it will formally open sometime in 2017.\nConstruction began in 2011 after years of controversy on whether Ashdod needs a hospital, whether its existence will attract staff and patients from Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon and Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot; whether SHARAP should be allowed; and whether it should have been built and run by the state instead of a for-profit company.\nWhen Likud MK Yuval Steinitz as finance Minister, he signed an agreement on with Assuta Medical Centers Ltd. handing over 7 hectares (17.3 acres) of free land in the eastern part of Ashdod for it to build to build and run it.\nThen-health minister Yael German said she would cancel SHARAP services at the Ashdod hospital, but as the contracts were signed with Assuta years ago, she was unable to take action as minister and then was forced out of office by the elections.\nEven the State Comptroller criticized in one of his reports the government’s “handing over of huge sums to private interests to build and run a public hospital with private medical care in Ashdod.”\nAshdod Mayor Dr. Yehiel Lassri said that Bitterman’s choice “signifies an important step in the fulfilling the dream of Ashdod residents for the hospital.” He added that he knew the physician personally from their service in the IDF Medical Corps and that Bitterman is a person of great experience and achievement in the health system.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:51:03.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
