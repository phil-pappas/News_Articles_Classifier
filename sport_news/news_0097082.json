It failed massively, and EVERYBODY ripped the Colts, and Colts Coach Chuck Pagano for calling it. Deservedly so too! \nWe all took shots at the Indianapolis Colts, here’s mine: Worse than John Shoop's \"throw a 3-yd out on 3rd & 7\" or \"Have Jim Miller throw to the guy who already fell down\" https://t.co/B35SavOB8D \n— Paul M. Banks (@PaulMBanks) October 19, 2015 \nYou can also view footage of the play in question, as indeed it’s highly questionable. So exactly WTF were the Indianapolis Colts “trying” to do? CBS Sports Network Analyst Steve Beuerlein, on his show “NFL Monday QB” offers an explanation, of sorts (ON Indianapolis Colts ATTEMPTED TRICK PLAY) Beuerlein : I have no problem at all with the play whatsoever – until they snapped the ball of course. The players have to know what the heck is going on, what the purpose of the play is. They (should have been) standing out there on the field with a specific mission in mind… whether it was trying to catch them with too many men on the field or trying to get them to burn a timeout. The intent was fantastic. The execution was pathetic. There’s no excuse for it. Worst case scenario, they should have called a timeout… I don’t know what the problem was, but it was really pathetic execution. And that goes go all the way back to the top. That was a very, very significant play in the ballgame. Don’t minimize that. Paul M. Banks owns, operates and sometimes writes The Sports Bank.net , which is partnered with FOX Sports Engage Network.
