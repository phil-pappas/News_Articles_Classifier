(Photo by Allen Sharpe) × COLUMBIA — It was about 3:30 Tuesday afternoon when Steve Spurrier returned home from the announcement of his resignation as South Carolina’s football coach. “What are you going to do now?” his wife Jerri asked him. The now-former Head Ball Coach didn’t miss a beat. “I’m going to go hit a few golf balls,” he told her. That’s how Spurrier described it in an impromptu call to SiriusXM College Sports Radio on Wednesday afternoon. “Life is a little different,” he told hosts Rick Neuheisel and Chris Childers. “I don’t have any football practice or football meetings. But we’ve got a good staff, and hopefully these guys can get it turned around here at South Carolina.” Spurrier, 70, resigned Tuesday after a 2-4 start which marked his worst first half of a season at USC. The Gamecocks are 0-4 in the SEC for the first time since the 0-11 season of 1999, and need to win four of their final six games to avoid their first losing campaign since 2003. Less than two seasons ago, the Gamecocks were 11-2 and ranked No. 4 in the final AP Top 25. “Somehow or another, I don’t know if our recruiting, or whatever happened, but obviously we haven’t done a very good job,” Spurrier told SiriusXM. “And the team, it needs new direction. So I’m stepping out and allowing the next guy to have his shot.” Spurrier initially considered retirement last season, but a spate of recruiting de-commitments let him to claim he was on a “two-to-three-year plan” and later a “four-to-five-year plan.” The entire saga made recruiting difficult for Spurrier, who said that’s something the next USC coach needs to correct. “It’s a game of recruiting. Recruit, recruit, recruit. When you’re an older coach like I am, you have to present the image, I’m going to be here 5 to 10 years. When it looks like he’s going to be there one or two more years, it is hard to recruit. And that’s why coaches usually get it out of by 65 or even earlier than that,” he said. “But we’ve got to recruit. We’ve got to go recruiting. Most of the coaches who were here two, three years ago are still here. So I can’t blame it all on the players. But we’ve not put quite the talent together. But maybe they can turn it around.” Now, that challenge falls to interim head coach Shawn Elliott. Spurrier, meanwhile, moves on to the next phase — whatever that might be. “It was time,” he said of his resignation. “I’ve been blessed way beyond my wildest expectations, and now I’m looking forward to doing something else in life.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:31:22.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
