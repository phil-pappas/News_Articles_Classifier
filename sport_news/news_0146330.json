Won Atlantic Division. Lost to Tampa Bay Lightning in Eastern Conference semifinals. \nCOACH: Michel Therrien, 11th NHL season, \nADDED: D Mark Barberio, RW Zack Kassian, RW Alex Semin. \nLOST: D Sergei Gonchar, C Manny Malhotra, RW P.A. Parenteau, LW Brandon Prust, D Mike Weaver. \nPLAYER TO WATCH: Alex Semin. Despite finishing a mere three points behind the New York Rangers for the Presidents’ Trophy, Montreal was not an offensive powerhouse in 2014-15. The Canadiens finished last season having scored 214 goals, an average of 2.61 per game, and their power play ranked 23rd in the NHL. Semin, signed to a one-year, $1.1 million contract will be asked to do more in Montreal after scoring just six goals in 57 games last season with Carolina. \nOUTLOOK: Montreal and its deep roster with standout goaltender Carey Price should make another run in the playoffs - maybe even a deep run. All Price accomplished in 2014-15 was to lead the NHL in save percentage (.933), goals-against average (1.96) and wins (44), earning the Hart Trophy, Ted Lindsay Award, Vezina Trophy and Jennings Trophy in the process. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:38:05.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
