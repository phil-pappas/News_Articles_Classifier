Things worked out pretty well.”\nJay Plotkin Lake Travis linebacker Mateo Lopez, left, pressures Anderson quarterback Trey Lundquist on Friday night. The Cavaliers won the District 14-6A matchup after rolling to a 46-point halftime lead. CREDIT: Jay Plotkin/For American-Statesman Austin High (4-2, 2-2 in District 14-6A) opened the scoring halfway through the first quarter when Kalbacher connected with Rudy Saenz for a 10-yard touchdown pass on fourth down. The Maroons came close to taking that touchdown advantage into the break, but a Kalbacher fumble gave the Rebels the ball inside the Austin 35 with two minutes to go. Five plays later, Hays’ Cody Gandy, who finished with 105 yards rushing, jogged untouched into the end zone to knot the score 7-7.\nKalbacher atoned for his fumble at the end of the third quarter, connecting with Traudt on a 29-yard post that gave Austin High a 14-7 lead.\nThe fourth quarter proved to be a wild one. After Jax Kell drilled a 22-yard field goal to cut the Maroons’ lead to 14-10, Kalbacher answered with a 30-yard strike to Miles Brown to make it 20-10, but Hays didn’t fold. Quarterback Isaac Castilleja connected with Dustin Bruno for a 54-yard touchdown to slash the Rebels’ deficit to 20-17 with seven minutes to play.\nRound Rock defensive lineman Albert Durden brings down a Rouse ballcarrier Friday night in the Dragons’ blowout victory. Round Rock improved to 3-0 in District 13-6A play. CREDIT: Henry Huey/For American-Statesman Hays (4-3, 3-2) had a chance stop Austin High on a fourth down-and-6 play near midfield with two minutes to go, but Kalbacher used his legs, to accrue a 27-yard gain.\n“It was me and a lot of green grass,” he said. “I knew I could get six yards so I went for it.”\nSeveral plays later, Kalbacher sealed the victory with a 6-yard touchdown pass to his favorite target, Traudt.\nRound Rock 60, Rouse 15: The Dragons (5-1, 3-0 District 13-6A) started with a special-teams score, then unleashed their offense and finished with some great defense to overwhelm the Raiders (2-4, 1-2) at Bible Stadium.\nAfter James Lynch slung down Michael Forster for an eight-yard sack to set up fourth and long on Rouse’s opening drive, Albert Durden blocked the punt and Matthew James scooped up the ball from three yards out for a touchdown. Andrew Stefani’s two-point conversion run made it 8-0 just two minutes into the game.\nRouse responded with a 67-yard scoring drive, with Marquis Simmons shouldering most of the load with eight straight runs to the Round Rock 9 yard-line. Forster lofted a pass to Brady Kaloustian for the TD and scored on a two-point keeper to tie the game.\nAfter that, it was all Round Rock. Brian Bullock ran back the kickoff 80 yards to the Raiders 3 to set up Day’shus White with his 10th rushing touchdown of the season.\nQuarterback Liam Baird counted four touchdowns among his six completions, including a pair to Zech Nash-Kelly as the Dragons took a 43-8 halftime lead.\nRound Rock’s defense limited Rouse to eight first downs and nabbed a pair of interceptions and three sacks.\n— Bob Brinkman, AA-S correspondent\nLake Travis 60, Anderson 3: Charlie Brewer connected with Cade Brewer for a 27-yard touchdown on the game’s first play, sparking the Cavaliers (6-0, 4-0 District 14-6A) to a romp over the Trojans (2-5, 0-5) at Burger Stadium.\nThe Cavaliers junior quarterback finished with four touchdown passes – all in the first half – and both Abe Willows and Santiago Villegas rushed for more than 100 yards. After the opening play score, Brewer hit Cade Green for two scores and Maleek Barkley for another as Lake Travis cruised to a 46-0 halftime lead.\nAnderson ended an 11-quarter shutout streak by the Lake Travis defense when Alfredo Estrada connected for a 30-yard field goal with 4:10 left in the game. The Cavaliers’ second-string defense played the bulk of the second half and kept the streak alive earlier with a goal-line stand.\n“We wanted the shutout and didn’t get it,” Lake Travis coach Hank Carter told his team after the game. “That’s OK. It was still a great team win and a great goal-line stand by the second team.”\n“I’m extremely happy with what we’ve done,” said defensive tackle Tevin Paul. “We just need to keep getting better, but we’re where we need to be at this point.”\nBrewer finished 14 of 21 for 167 yards and the four scores. Willows rushed for 118 yards and two scores on just eight first-half carries. Villegas gained 143 yards and a score on 11 carries. The Cavaliers racked up 535 yards offense on the night.\nAnderson QB Trey Lundquist passed for 174 yards.\n— Jay Plotkin, AA-S correspondent\nWestlake 58, Akins 19: For a quarter, the Eagles held a lead over the ninth-ranked Class 6A team in the state.\nThe Chaparrals (6-0, 4-0), however, scored 51 unanswered points to dismiss Akins (4-3, 2-3) in a District 14-6A game at Chaparral Stadium.\nSam Ehlinger was as good as the Chaps have come to expect. The Texas Longhorns pledge completed 15 of 20 pass attempts for 297 yards and five touchdowns. He rushed for another and had 69 yards on eight carries.\nIt wasn’t a clean night of football from Westlake.\nAkins could have easily jumped out to a 14-0 lead, instead of 7-0, in the first quarter.\nEhlinger fumbled after a 7-yard run on Westlake’s first possession. Akins then drove to the Westlake 10-yard line and went for it on fourth down. Quarterback Mike Gonzalez was intercepted by Max Mangum on the 1 to save the touchdown.\nThe Chaparals turned the ball over on downs, and Gonzales connected with Will Cortinas for a 15-yard scoring strike with 40 seconds left in the first quarter.\n“One thing we always talk about is playing a good seven minutes. We didn’t play a good first seven minutes,” said Westlake coach Todd Dodge. “A little sloppy, but proud of our kids. We got a lot of young men the chance to play.”\nEhlinger set up a 24-yard touchdown pass to Reed Klubnik seven seconds in to the second quarter with a 30-yard run from the Westlake 46-yard-line.\nGonzales threw his second interception, this time caught by Mack Kelley, on Akins’ next possession. Ehlinger found Chase Cokley eight plays later for the first of three touchdown catches by the senior.\nWestlake scored 16 points in less than two minutes after Cokley’s score on a safety and a 70-yard kickoff return from Stephen Rioux.\nEhlinger ran in a 3-yard score late in the quarter to send Westlake into the locker room with a 30-7 lead.\nCokley and Ehlinger connected two more times in the third quarter for touchdown passes of 12 and 60 yards. Westlake’s leading receiver finished with five catches for 112 yards.\nEhlinger and Klubnik capped off a 51-0 run with a 33-yard pass late in the third quarter.\nGonzales threw his second touchdown pass in the final seconds of the quarter, a 27-yarder to Jermaine Thomas. Kenan Lockhart ran for 108 yards for the Eagles.\n— Michael Adams, ACN\nCedar Park 51, Leander 14: Jack Grimm ran for three touchdowns as the Timberwolves, the top-ranked Class 5A team in Texas, rolled the Lions at Gupton Stadium.\nGrimm scored on 3-, 1-, and 10-yard runs as Cedar Park (6-0, 3-0 District 25-5A) won its eighth straight in the series with its oldest rival. Leander (2-4, 1-3) last beat Cedar Park in 2007.\nFullback Tyler Lavine ran for 94 yards while quarterback Mak Sexton completed 10 of 20 passes for 179 yards to pace Cedar Park’s offense.\nCedar Park’s defense held Leander to 216 total yards, with 89 coming on the Lions touchdown drive late in the second half. That six-play, 89-yard drive was sparked by a 59-yard reception by Matthew Long to the 1-yard line. One play later, Long had the TD plunge 38 seconds before halftime.\nLeander added a second touchdown in the fourth quarter, a 27-yard pass from Parker McNeil to Joseph Livengood. But Cedar Park countered with an 11-yard touchdown run by backup quarterback Baxter Robertson and a pair of scores by Hayden Craig.\nBoth teams were hurt by penalties as the officials called 23 infractions. Cedar Park committed 14 penalties for 127 yards, while Leander had 9 for 74 yards.\n— Sean Shapiro, AA-S correspondent\nCedar Ridge 38, Pflugerville 9: Garrett Sharp completed 13 of 23 passes for 258 yards and four touchdowns as unbeaten Cedar Ridge remained tied for the lead in District 13-6A.\nThe Raiders (6-0, 3-0) scored two touchdowns in less than a minute to close out the third quarter and put the game out of reach. First, Sharp connected with Erik Wade for a 66-yard scoring pass. Then Cedar Ridge’s Jamir Williams returned an interception 46 yards for a score, pushing the Raiders’ lead to 31-9.\nCedar Ridge jumped ahead 14-0 in the first quarter.\nThe Raiders’ Kadarius Daniels returned the opening kickoff 56 yards, and five plays later, Sharp completed a 23-yard scoring pass to Blake Patterson. After Pflugerville went three-and-out, Cedar Ridge marched 80 yards, scoring on Sharp’s 13-yard pass to Wade.\nPflugerville’s touchdown came in the third quarter, when Justyn Merriweather connected with Dawson Tamez for a 68-yard touchdown pass.\nThe Panthers dropped to 1-5, 1-2.\n— Butch Hart, AA-S correspondent\nReagan 27, Bastrop 15: Mulbah Car rushed for 175 yards and three touchdowns as the Raiders (3-3, 2-1 District 26-5A) beat the Bears (3-3, 1-2) at Nelson Field.\nCar was the focal point of the Raiders’ offense on a dominant 19-play, 93-yard touchdown drive that took nearly 12 minutes off the clock and ended with a 3-yard run by quarterback Amado Aguilera. The drive — all running plays — put the Raiders up 27-15 with 2:20 left on the clock.\nThe Bears had their chances in the second half. Jaedon McGee recovered a Reagan fumble on the Raiders 23-yard line, and the Bears drove down to the 7 before being stopped on fourth down to set up the signature Reagan drive.\nReagan took an early lead when Car rushed in from one yard out to make it 6-0, but Bastrop answered with a 42-yard touchdown run from Jovahn Jones. Bastrop also got a pair of Jose Sanchez field goals from 31 and 38 yards.\nCar made it a one-score game again with 5:13 to go in the half when he broke a 52-yard touchdown run. He also scored on a 10-yard run with 20 seconds to go in the half to give the Raiders a 20-15 advantage.\nAguilera kept the Bears honest through the air. He was 7 for 10 for 154 yards and added 12 carries for 32 yards and a score on the ground. Bastrop’s Jones rushed 15 times for 85 yards.\nThe Raiders defense held the Bears to just 25 yards passing and 167 total yards.\n— Chris Dukes, ACN\nManor 57, Elgin 22: Quarterback Johnny Gaston accounted for seven touchdowns – four passing and three rushing – and the visiting Mustangs (4-3, 2-1 District 17-5A) mashed the Wildcats (1-6, 1-1).\nElgin committed four first-half turnovers that set up Manor with short fields and quick scores.\nThe Wildcats held the Mustangs to three-and-out on their first drive but, once Elgin took over, quarterback Jett Moore was picked off by Xavier Zamora on the first play. Two plays later, Manor scored on a 4-yard quarterback keeper by Gaston on a zone read.\nThe theme continued at the end of the first quarter. Da’Clayvin Simmons had a big gainer on a catch over the middle but lost the ball and Manor recovered. On the next play, Gaston hit Kevin Waites in stride on a post route for a 43-yard touchdown. Gaston then found Carlos Chester for the two-point conversion to make it 22-0 in the first quarter.\nElgin finally got on the board in the second quarter when Donovan Thomas ran in from 13 yards out. Thomas led all rushers with 119 yards on 31 carries.\nManor receiver Lyndemian Brooks had three catches for 128 yards including a 45-yard touchdown in the third quarter.\nElgin’s Cesar Perez picked off a pass and scored from eight yards out in the fourth quarter after Manor had brought in backup QB Clifton Haywood.\n— Travis Atkins, AA-S correspondent\nKerrville Tivy 52, Lockhart 17: In a battle of unbeaten District 27-5A teams, Kerrville Tivy totaled 493 yards in posting its its sixth consecutive win of the season. The Antlers scored on all eight of their possessions in the game.\nIt took 47 seconds for Kerrville Tivy to get on the board, with Ian Ronan’s 5-yard touchdown run capping a three-play drive. The Antlers added two more touchdowns in the first quarter, with Cade Dyal finding Trahan for a 50-yard touchdown pass before Dyal’s 1-yard run gave Tivy a 21-3 lead.\nLockhart rallied in the second quarter, with D.J. Ellison accounting for two rushing touchdowns. Ellison finished with a game-high 184 rushing yards on 32 carries. Through seven games, he has 1,342 yards rushing and 15 touchdowns.\nThe second half belonged to Tivy, with the Antlers tacking on three more touchdowns.\nLockhart, which rushed for 276 yards on 62 carries, dropped to 6-1, 4-1 in 27-5A.\n— Quixem Ramirez, AA-S\nDripping Springs 56, East View 21: Dripping Springs scored on its first five possessions and coasted past host East View in a District 25-5A contest.\nRobert Credeur led a balanced Dripping Springs rushing attack as he gained 97 yards on eight carries, which included a pair of 14-yard scoring runs.

Juanye Johnson had 53 yards on the ground for the Vikings.\n— Ken Whalen, AA-S correspondent\nWaco 35, Hutto 28: Quarterback Jalen Harris fired a 33-yard touchdown strike to Julius Kennedy with 29 seconds remaining to lift the Lions (4-3, 2-1 District 17-5A) over the visiting Hippos (4-2, 1-1).\nHutto had fought back from three deficits to take the lead 28-21 on Noah Ramos’ 2-yard run with 5:27 to play in the game. Then Harris made the first of two huge plays late. Following the kickoff, he ran 75 yards for a score with 5:10 to play to make it 28-all.\nThe Hippos, trailing 7-0 and 14-7, used some deception to draw even at 14 at halftime. Wide receiver Tyler Nunn completed a 34-yard touchdown pass to quarterback Tyler Herrick with one second left in the first half.\nHutto fell behind 21-14 in the third quarter after a Harris scoring run, but this time Nunn and Herrick hooked up again to tie the game with 10:55 to play. This time, Herrick, in his more familiar role, threw a 7-yard TD toss to Nunn, who finished with 10 catches for 92 yards.\nIn the end, Waco’s powerful ground force was a bit too much for Hutto’s potent air attack. The Lions rushed for 334 yards, including 198 by Harris. The Hippos passed for 308 yards.\nHerrick completed 25 of 39 passes for 274 yards with one TD and no INTs. Herrick also was his team’s top rusher with 46 yards on 17 carries.

Herman hit Beau Corrales for a 33-yard touchdown with 41 seconds to play in the first.\nJo’Vonta Grimble pulled down a Herman pass in the corner of the end zone for a 21-0 halftime advantage.\nGeorgetown quickly scored in the third quarter following a 62-yard kickoff return, Corrales corralling a 2-yard pass from Herman to make it 28-0.\nMarble Falls then went on a remarkable march for its only touchdown. The Mustangs covered 86 yards on 22 plays, a drive that was made extremely difficult by offensive holding calls on four consecutive snaps. QB Robert Atkinson finally capped the drive with a 1-yard run.\nThe Eagles wasted little time answering on Jamel Powell’s 33-yard scoring run.\nTemple 69, Connally 14: The state-ranked Wildcats (6-1, 3-0) amassed 710 total yards – including 428 passing – to crush the visiting Cougars (2-5, 0-3) in District 17-5A action.\nTemple led 28-0 after one quarter, 48-7 at the half and added three more touchdowns in the third period before letting off the gas.\nConnally’s Jalen Broussard snatched a 56-yard scoring reception from Robert Patterson, their only hookup of the night.

The Lobos slipped to 0-7, 0-5.\nWilson rushed for 123 yards on 17 carries.\nLiberty Hill 31, Canyon Lake 7: Dyllon Joiner returned a fumble 55 yards for a touchdown — one of four turnovers Liberty Hill’s defense produced — and the visiting Panthers (4-2, 1-0) opened District 14-4A play with a solid win over the Hawks (2-4, 0-1).\nJon Shannon ran for 125 yards on 24 carries for Liberty Hill. He started the scoring with a 30-yard run in the second quarter. Then Joiner notched the defensive score for a 14-0 lead.\nAhead 14-7 at the half, Shannon’s 5-yard TD run gave the Panthers some breathing room in the third quarter. They added 10 points in the fourth.\nLiberty Hill outgained Canyon Lake 300-124, rushing for 287 yards. Caleb Guerin added 71 yards on 10 carries for the Panthers.\nChina Spring 42, Burnet 20: The unbeaten Cougars (5-0, 1-0) displayed a dominant ground game and kept Bulldogs star quarterback Austin Moore from completing long passes to win the District 13-4A, Division I opener at Burnet (4-2, 0-1).\nBrock Foster had a 19-yard run to give the Bulldogs an early lead.

The lead was short-lived, however, as La Grange junior JK Dobbins scored the first of his four touchdowns on a 33-yard scamper. Dobbins scored again in the second quarter, this time on an 86-yard run, to boost the Leopards’ lead to 23-13.\nLa Grange (6-1) dominated the second half, scoring 21 points in the third quarter on a pair of TD runs by Dobbins — one covering 70 yards — and a 48-yard scoring jaunt by Colter Siptak.\nDobbins piled up 342 yards on 22 carries, helping the Leopards tally 484 yards rushing.\nMathis threw for 174 yards and two TDs.\n— Robbie Brown, AA-S correspondent\nLuling 33, S.A.

He had 61 yards rushing.\nEdel Hernandez ran for 196 yards on 23 carries and two scores for Florence.\nHyde Park 25, Regents 24: Seth Devries scored on a run and a pass in the fourth quarter to give the host Panthers (5-0, 1-0) a one-point victory over the Knights (2-4, 1-1).\nDevries, the dominant force in the tight contest, ran 32 yards for a touchdown to bring Hyde Park within 24-19.
