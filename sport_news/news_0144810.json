Andrew Obregon is a suspect in the September killing of Tywon Anderson, who was found dead in a Kenosha County cornfield Sept. 26. Lake County sheriff's spokesman Chris Covelli said northern Illinois police departments were notified at 3:27 p.m. Tuesday by Kenosha County officials to be on the lookout for a Chevrolet Spark that Obregon, 33, was suspected to be driving. Obregon carjacked the vehicle in Brighton, Wisconsin, and battered the female driver, authorities said. The Kenosha County sheriff's office advised Obregon was considered armed and dangerous, and that he had said he would \"shoot the police and go out big,\" Covelli said. Minutes later, a Lake County deputy spotted a Chevrolet Spark in the area of Green Bay Road and Ninth Street near Zion. The officer tried to stop the car, but Obregon sped away, Covelli said. Covelli said the car came to an abrupt stop on Ninth Street east of Lewis Avenue, and Obregon ran into nearby woods. During the chase, police shot Obregon. \"At this point we are not naming the agency involved,\" Covelli said. Obregon was taken to a hospital for nonlife-threatening injuries and later was released into police custody.
