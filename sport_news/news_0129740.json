Villaruel   14, 2015 - 12:00am \nCEBU, Philippines – The University of the Visayas Green Lancers built a huge lead early in the fourth quarter and it was enough to cushion them to a series-tying 70-63 victory over the University of San Carlos Warriors in Game 2 of their-best-five collegiate division finals in the 15th Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. men's basketball tournament last night at the Cebu Coliseum. \nJust like in the series opener, the Lancers jumped off to a hot start but they sustained their momentum this time, never looking back after cruising to an early 20-9 lead. \nThe closest the Warriors could pull through was at 21-26 as Jun Kent Manzo and Franz Arong masterminded a 15-6 spurt that spurred the Lancers to a 41-27 edge at halftime. \nIt was an all-Lancers show from there as the Warriors couldn't get rhythm when it mattered. \nStill in high spirits with their shots clicking and their defense working, the wards of coach Gary Cortes kept on pounding the Warriors on the way to establish an imposing 22-point advantage, 58-36, on Arong's basket with just 46 seconds gone by in the final period. \nThe Warriors, however, refused to roll down and just die, staging a ferocious comeback anchored on their Cameroonian import Shooster Olago.   \nAfter Gio Laguyo banked a 3-pointer to end USC's scoring spell, Olago completed three consecutive 3-point plays in a 16-4 blitz that pulled the Warriors within 62-52 at the last four-minute mark. \nThe Lancers quickly countered, with Steve Cedrick Akomo scoring on a put-back and then Arong made a breakaway layup as they regained a 68-53 advantage with a little over two minutes left to play. \nJust when everybody thought the Lancers were headed to a lopsided triumph, the Warriors provided the crowd some thrill by launching a fluid 10-0 run that towed them to within just five points, 63-68, on Ian Tagapan's trey with 15 seconds remaining. \nIt was obvious at that moment though that victory was already in the palm of the Lancers' hands. \nArong then hit a pair of free throws off a foul by Victory Rabat to settle the final tally. \nManzo, who suffered a cut in his left chin, topscored for the Lancers with 20 points. They still played without injured star forward Leonard Santillan, but Arong and Arvie Cabañero stepped up with 11 and 10 markers, respectively. \nOlago paced the Warriors with 27 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter when the outcome of the match already tilted in favor of the Lancers. Tagapan finished with 15 points, but the rest of USC's local crew appeared to be a monumental bust.
