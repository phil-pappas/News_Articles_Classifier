We’ll get lots of sleep here the next couple of weeks.” \nLogano did it on an afternoon where Chase contenders were dropping like flies. \nMatt Kenseth, who came to Charlotte with a pair of wins in the past four races, had a nightmare afternoon where everything that could go wrong did go wrong. He hit the wall at least four times before parking the No. 20 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota and finishing 42nd. \nIt wasn’t a great day for Kyle Busch, either, as he collided with Kyle Larson at the entrance to pit lane, damaging the No. 18 JGR Toyota and finishing 20th. \nDale Earnhardt Jr., meanwhile, came into the Chase with a good head of steam in the No. 88 Chevrolet but now his chances of advancing to the next round are on life support after twice hitting the wall on Sunday and finishing 28th. \nRyan Newman, who last season relied on consistent top-10 results to make it to the final Chase round, wasn’t so lucky on Sunday, with a 15th-place finish in the No. 31 Chevrolet. \nOn the other side of the coin, Kevin Harvick kept his string of strong results alive with a second place in the No. 4 Stewart Haas Racing Chevrolet and Martin Truex Jr. jumped into contention to move to the next round with a third-place finish in the No. 78 Furniture Row Chevrolet. \nHAIL TO THE CHAMP \nMemo to the Formula 1 world championship trophy engraver: It’s L-e-w-i-s H-a-m-i-l-t-o-n. \nNothing, it appears, now stands in the way of Hamilton winning his third championship and his second consecutive title for Mercedes after his victory on Sunday at the Russian Grand Prix on the Sochi Circuit. \nIt puts Hamilton 66 points clear of new second-place driver, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, and 73 points ahead of hard-luck Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg. \nWith four grands prix left on the 2015 calendar, Hamilton is now just nine points away from claiming the championship in the No. 44 Mercedes. \nHis performance on Sunday also puts an exclamatory end to any discussion over who is No. 1 in the Mercedes paddock. \nAs much as the racing gods have smiled on Hamilton in the past two seasons they have certainly frowned on Rosberg, and nowhere was it more evident than at Sochi. \nRemember, it was almost universally believed that Rosberg would be the heir to Michael Schumacher at Mercedes and that Hamilton was brought on board to push the young German to multiple championships. \nWell, it hasn’t exactly worked out that way. \nRight from the start of his tenure with the Silver Arrow team, Hamilton made it clear he wasn’t going to be anybody’s No. 2. \nOn Sunday when Rosberg finally was able to keep Hamilton behind him on the start after winning the pole position, it was a throttle failure that ended his day and any hope of ever catching his teammate this season. \nHamilton did have some reliability concerns in the race as well — the DRS was not working on his car — but it was not enough to affect the outcome. \nHe recognized that he has been pretty much spared from the mechanical issues that hit Rosberg. \n“Nico has been incredibly unfortunate to suffer the worst,” Hamilton said. \nFINISH LINES \nIt seems that Kimi Raikkonen did learn something in his ever-so-brief dalliance with NASCAR. The way he slammed Valtteri Bottas on the final lap at Sochi was pure stock car racing. ....Kurt Busch is having more legal woes as a result of his disastrous relationship with ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll.
