The event occurred 23 years to the day of Jones’ signature play, a hit he delivered against Miami’s Larry Jones during the 1992 game between the Seminoles and the Hurricanes in the old Orange Bowl in Miami. \nThe iconic photo shows both players parallel to the ground, with the ball jarred loose. FSU defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews later said, “I don’t know how [Larry Jones] got up.” \nJones played at FSU from 1990-1992, entering the NFL draft after his junior year. He went on to play 10 years with the New York Jets. \n“I’m overwhelmed,” Jones told Seminoles.com before the game. “Long after I’m gone, it will still be a part of history and part of a group of people that lives on with the history of Florida State. So I’m quite honored. I guess it really hasn’t all-the-way hit me.” \nThe Miami native, whose brother Fred played for FSU from 1983-1986, becomes the 10th Seminole player to have his jersey retired. The others are Deion Sanders (2), Derrick Brooks (10), Chris Weinke (16), Charlie Ward (17), Fred Biletnikoff (25), Terrell Buckley (27), Warrick Dunn (28), Ron Sellers (34) and Ron Simmons (50). \nCook first again \nNot only has Florida State scored first in all five of its games this season but sophomore running back Dalvin Cook has done the honors in four of them. \nCook’s 72-yard TD run after receiving an option pitch from quarterback Everett Golson on the Seminoles’ first possession of the game was also Cook’s third long-distance run to open the scoring for the ’Noles. He had a 94-yard TD run against Wake Forest last week and broke off a 74-yard run for FSU’s first score against South Florida. \nCook scored from 1 yard out to start out the opening game against Texas State. \nWhen Cook took a pass in the flat from Golson later in the first period and scored on a 36-yard play, it was the first receiving touchdown of his FSU career. \nCook’s first score was his 15th career rushing TD, and five have gone for 40 yards or longer. His average TD run is 34 yards. \nEarly antics \nFSU-Miami games in the past have featured extracurricular activities before the game. Bernard Clark ’s attempt to stop Renegade as the horse galloped onto the field before the 1989 game is one of the more notorious incidents. It’s been more civil in recent years. \nHowever, it’s likely a brief skirmish before Saturday’s game was the first to involve a kicker. \nFSU’s Robert Aguayo was practicing field goal attempts on both ends of the field, and when he turned to the side where a few Miami players were warming up, it got testy. Miami safety Rayshawn Jenkins appeared to take the most offense, and he and Aguayo had words before a member of the FSU staff led Aguayo away. \nMarshall an early out \nLake City resident Trey Marshall had the best game of his career last week against Wake Forest. \nHe didn’t get much of a chance to follow that up against the Hurricanes. \nMarshall, a sophomore nickel back, was ejected from the game halfway through the first quarter for a targeting call on Miami quarterback Brad Kayaa . Marshall was blitzing and hit Kaaya with his helmet down, in the chest area. After a review, the call was confirmed. \nThe penalty gave Miami a first down at the Seminoles’ 2 but the defense rallied. Kaaya fumbled on the next play and recovered it, losing 6 yards. Kaaya threw incomplete on second down and Demarcus Walker of Jacksonville then sacked him for a 5-yard loss, forcing UM to settle for a 30-yard field goal by Michael Badgley . \nIt was the second time this season the ’Noles had lost a player because of targeting. Lamarcus Brutus was ejected in the South Florida game. \nSouth Florida connections \nFlorida State has long reaped a number of players from South Florida, dating back to the early years of the Bobby Bowden Era. \nThe current two-deep depth chart for FSU, however, is one of the thinnest in terms of a connection to Palm Beach, Broward and Dade counties. \nThe Seminoles’ depth chart for the game against the Hurricanes had nine players from South Florida, led by the wide receiver corps of Travis Rudolph , Jesus Wilson and Ermon Lane . Leading rusher Cook and defensive linemen Fredrick Jones , Nile Lawrence-Stample and Keith Bryant are also from the region. \nHowever, it’s cyclical and coach Jimbo Fisher has more than made up for it with his aggressive recruiting from outside the state of Florida. The two-deep depth chart for the Miami game included 22 players from 10 states and one international player, tight end Marvin Saunders . \nEtc. \nAguayo’s 22-yard field goal in the second quarter made him 23-of-23 on attempts from 30 yards and closer during his college career. … Ryan Izzo ’s 37-yard reception from Golson in the first quarter was the longest pass for an FSU tight end this season. … Junior cornerback Jalen Ramsey made his 33rd consecutive start, the longest current streak on the team. … FSU has allowed only six points in first quarters this season, on two field goals. … Saturday was the 11th meeting in which the Seminoles were ranked in the AP poll and the Hurricanes were unranked. FSU won eight of those first 10 meetings, including three with Fisher as the coach. … During Fisher’s five-game win streak vs. Miami entering Saturday, FSU averaged 165 yards on the ground per game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:45:59.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
