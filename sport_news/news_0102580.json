Courtesy photo The American Legion Smyth-Bolter Post 54 recently honored students sponsored by the group who attended Boys State and Girls State this past summer. \nStudents were invited to a regular meeting of the Legion to tell of their experiences. The two students who were able to attend were Gabrielle Icardo, who attended Girls State, and Kenneth Warnock, who attended Boys State. Students who were not able to attend were Lindsey Moore, Seth Farrell, Wyatt Faughnan and Benjamin Richardson. \nIcardo and Warnock said their time at each conference was rewarding and gave them an understanding of the workings of city and state government. Both were presented with a proclamation from Congressman Todd McClintock, and Boys State representatives received a proclamation from Assemblyman Frank Bigelow and Sen. Tom Berryhill while in Sacramento. The Girls State representatives were given the proclamation from Bigelow and Berryhill at the American Legion meeting. \nThe Legion sponsors students to Boys and Girls State with money raised by a monthly pancake breakfast and an annual firewood raffle.
