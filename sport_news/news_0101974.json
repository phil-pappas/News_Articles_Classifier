WWCC slipped to 4-3-4 and 6-3-6, and now stand four points behind first-place Spokane in the East standings. The Sasquatch nipped Columbia Basin, 1-0, on Saturday. Each team tallied a first-half goal. The Warriors scored in the 30th minute. Forward Christian Segovia was stopped by WVC goalie Alan Caro on an initial effort in front of the Knights’ goal, but secured and put away the rebound. “That’s the kind of character he has,” WWCC coach Ben Rotert said. “He has a never-say-die attitude. He stayed with it (the initial shot) and put it in the back of the net.” Wenatchee equalized in the 34th minute when Soto sent in a cross from the right side of the pitch that forward Jason Morales headed past Walla Walla keeper Fernando Gutierrez. “We’re either really good or really bad. It’s interesting,” Rotert said. “We scored the first goal and then we fell asleep. We need to work on our mental consistency so when we go up, we have the determination to finish a game out.” The Warriors applied pressure at the outset of the second half, but were unable to break the tie. Jose Anguiano headed a Emilio Meraz-Rodriguez cross toward goal, only to have it stopped by Caro in the 47th minute and forward Brenden Kenley rocketed a shot over the top of the net in the 48th minute. The Knights jumped in front at the 69-minute mark when the Warriors failed to clear a corner kick and midfielder Jorge Lara booted a ball home from the top of the 18-yard box. WWCC responded in the 75th minute. Kenley, stationed at midfield, headed a pass to a streaking Anguiano — who beat Caro with a low, hard shot from the doorstep of the Wenatchee goal. “It showed what we’re capable of,” Rotert said. “It’s something we work on. A majority of our goals come from some kind of teamwork.” But in the end, the goals by Villa and Soto were more than the Warriors could overcome. “Their third goal came on a scramble in the box,” Rotert said. “It was an unlucky break. We needed to get something,” Rotert said of his team’s approach prior to Wenatchee’s final dagger. “We committed to sending guys forward and just got caught out.” Walla Walla plays at Treasure Valley on Wednesday. “This was another lost opportunity for us,” Rotert said. “We need to get back on the right track and out of the slump that we’re in. But we have done enough to stay No. 2 (in the East),” Rotert said. “Anything can happen. The boys need to come back fired up and inspired and get a result at Treasure.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:30:26.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
