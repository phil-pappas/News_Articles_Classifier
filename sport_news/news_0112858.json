Central City 6-110. Bishop Neumann 5-2 Bob Sez: Well, that didn't last long. Following Wahoo's 31-27 upset of former No. 1 Scotus, Norfolk Catholic returns to No. 1, Wahoo move from No. 5 to No. 2, and Scotus drops to No. 3. Norfolk Catholic (35-6) and N. 4 Boone (42-0 over Madison) won easily as did No. 5 Boys Town, 50-14 over Fort Calhoun, though the Cowboys do drop a spot to make room for Wahoo. Ashland-Greenwood (48-13 over Concordia) and Pierce (62-13 over West Point-Beemer) won easily. Wilber-Clatonia finally makes the rankings, last week shutting out Fairbury 48-0, while Central City returns after a 38-32 win over former No. 9 Holdrege. The loss by Holdrege also kicks out Ogallala - which has lost only to Holdrege - with Neumann dropping to spots, settling in at No. 10. Top Games for Week 8: Pierce at Norfolk Catholic (Thursday), Ashland-Greenwood at Boys Town, Wahoo at Bishop Neumann, Chase County at Ogallala, Syracuse at Falls City. Class C-2 2.
