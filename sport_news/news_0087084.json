Our mental fortitude is the difference when we win and when we don’t. That was evident today.” Walla Walla is now 3-3-1 in league play and 4-5-3 overall. Yakima is 1-4-2 and 5-4-3. Walla Walla was unable to finish a pair of chances in the eighth minute. Sam Filingeri-Oleson and Daisy Nateras were denied in close by Yakima goalie Katie Fowler. Yakima Valley claimed a 1-0 edge in the 12th minute when midfielder Sam Herzog booted a shot from the top of the 18-yard box over the outstretched arms of Warriors’ keeper Jeanette Alvarado. Filingeri-Oleson’s tough luck continued in the second half. She came close to converting a cross in the 51st minute and struck the cross bar from in deep at the 67-minute mark. But on the latter opportunity, teammate Jaz Lemos put away the rebound to even the score. WWCC kept the pressure on over the final 21 minutes, but was unable to produce the tie-breaking goal. “I felt we were the better team,” Hacker said. “Our players are working hard, but we need all 22 players working hard all the time.” Walla Walla’s next match is Thursday at Treasure Valley.
