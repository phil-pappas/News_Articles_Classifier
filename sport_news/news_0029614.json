For the complete story, please see www.mercurynews.com . \nSan Jose State had just 91 yards of total offense in the first half and things only got worse to open the third quarter. Potter threw interceptions on his first two passes of the period to feed San Diego State 10 points and help it build on a 17-7 halftime advantage. \nThe Aztecs bottled up the Spartans' star running back, Tyler Ervin, who entered the week as the nation's No. 2 rusher and leader in all-purpose yards. He had just 11 yards on his first 13 carries and minus-7 yards on his first two catches. \nMeanwhile, San Diego State star running back Donnel Pumphrey was in the midst of a big night with over 150 yards of total offense and two touchdowns by the midway point of the third quarter. \nThe game had major Mountain West Conference implications, with the winner taking sole possession of first place in the West Division. Both teams entered at 3-3 overall and in the watered-down division, the winner stood to be the only team with a winning overall record on the season.

Three of the Spartans' first six plays lost yardage, and SJSU opened with consecutive three-and-outs. \nMichael Carrizosa, the national leader in punting average entering the game, shanked his first punt of the night. He was being pressured and got off just a 17-yard kick that went out of bounds at the SJSU 37-yard line. \nPumphrey, the Mountain West's third-leading rusher, scored the game's first points with a 13-yard touchdown run to cap that drive. \nThe Spartans forced an Aztecs punt and got a little bit of offense going. Potter flipped a pass to true freshman running back Malik Roberson that he nabbed and raced for a 35-yard gain. A late-hit penalty on San Diego State tacked on 15 more yards to reach the Aztecs' 26. \nBut Potter was sacked on second down, scrambled for no gain on third down and Austin Lopez was wide left on a 48-yard field goal. \nThe Spartans helped San Diego State with a defensive penalty on its next drive, with Nick Oreglia jumping offside on third-and-3. Pumphrey hauled in a 38-yard touchdown reception from Maxwell Smith on the next snap to make it 14-0. \nSan Jose State answered with a drive that featured plenty of help from the visitors. Potter was hit late out of bounds on a third-down scramble to allow the Spartans to convert. Later in the drive, SJSU converted again on third down thanks to a pass interference call, although that likely prevented a touchdown. \nTwo penalties on one play on San Diego State's J.J. Whitaker -- he was called for unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct -- put the Spartans at the 2, and Potter scored on a third-down sneak to get within a touchdown. \nThe Aztecs took a 10-point lead into halftime when Danny Hageman made a 31-yard field goal with 18 seconds left in the second quarter. \nSan Jose State starting cornerback Jimmy Pruitt, the team's leader with three interceptions, sat out the game after developing concussion-like symptoms during the week.
