According to Golf Advisor's Managing Editor, Brandon Tucker , \"It's a lesser known course compared to the state's most prolific properties, like those around the Village of Pinehurst , and in the Outer Banks. But Scotch Hall Preserve, which opened in 2009, quietly racks up nothing but five-star reviews (32 to date). The layout provides saltwater scenery thanks to its location on the Albemarle Sound.\"\nGolf Advisor readers agree: \"Drove two hours from the Outer Banks area and wasn't disappointed,\" Mitch8203763 wrote in her Aug. 29 review of Scotch Hall Preserve. \"This course was spectacular. The greens fees were even more a surprise for such a high quality course.\"\nThe 7,463 yard Arnold Palmer Signature Course will challenge the most accomplished golfer, while the middle and forward tees make it just as enjoyable for the more casual player. With several holes that parallel the majestic Albemarle Sound and scenic Salmon Creek, the course looks as beautiful as it plays. The course was been described as \"The Jewel of the Inner Banks.\"\nStay and Play packages are currently being offered starting at $199 per person, including a two night stay at the Inn at Scotch Hall Preserve and two rounds of golf, based on double occupancy.\nThe course at Scotch Hall Preserve is open to the public for more information call 252-482-5300.\n \n\nSOURCE Scotch Hall Preserve", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:39:20.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
