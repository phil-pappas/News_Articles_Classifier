Now, donning the same sweater, the two have buried their old scores and moved forward. \"Gerbs, he was always a guy that would get under guys' skin, especially in his early Buffalo years. Going back to playoffs, Buffalo and Philly,” Versteeg said. He was a guy who would get at you, get in your face, and he was always there. He'd probably be the guy that you hated the most.” \nAlthough Gerbe hasn’t dropped the gloves often in his career, the shortest player in the NHL—standing at 5 feet 5 inches—still has a way of agitating his opponents. \nHe's [Versteeg] also an in your face type player, and so am I, so those players tend to clash,” Gerbe said. \nBrad Malone and newcomer James Wisniewski also had bad blood. The two dropped the gloves in 2011 when Malone was a member of the Colorado Avalanche, and Wisniewski with the Columbus Blue Jackets. \"I think I hit him and that was it,” Malone said. “He asked me to fight and I was trying to make a name for myself and stick in the league.\" \nFrom flying fists to separated lockers by six spots, it’s made for interesting conversation since the Canes acquired Wisniewski. Malone said under the “gentleman’s code,” the bad blood doesn’t last long. \"When you meet him you obviously want to shake his hand and probably want to have a beer with him, just to make sure he knows that I'm on his side and got his back,” Malone said. Malone and Wisniewski may have buried the hatchet, but the two haven’t come to terms with who won the bout. \"I'm obviously not going to give him the decision, I think we'll have to go to the judges,” Wisniewski said. “It is what it is, you just do your job. It's in the past , it's no big deal; you have a beer about it afterwards.\" Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:20:01.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
