Here are some of the highlights:\nQuestion: Texas Tech looks they have their confidence and Kliff Kingsbury has the swagger. Get the defense shored and could this team make a play for the Big 12 champs?\nSherrington: I don't know if they're ready for that, but they certainly look much better than last year. Of course, the Arkansas team they were steamrolled by last year also lost to Toledo. But the improvements in Tech's defense and offense are also obvious. The TCU game is big. The Frogs are missing a lot of people defensively and haven't played well on that side of the ball. David Gibbs will have his hands full with Trevone Boykin. They'll have to force him into some TOs to have a chance. I'll say this for Tech: They should give Texas a good run for fourth place in the Big 12, and maybe they can do better than that.\nQuestion: Guess I haven't been paying attention. What started this TCU-Baylor feud? Has it been going on for a long time or is it a product of last season?\nSherrington: The fact that both are private schools vying for same types of players, and Baylor got in the Big 12 when TCU didn't, probably started the feud. Patterson ramped it up a couple of years ago complaining publicly and to Briles about the play of Ahmad Dixon. And then Patterson said a Baylor player threatened him after last year's game in Waco. As I wrote yesterday, much of it is on Patterson, a very volatile, combustible type. Briles is just along for the ride.\nQuestion: If you were Kevin Sumlin, would you be a little perturbed that Kliff Kingsbury says Arkansas is going to get its butts kicked again by Texas A&M?\nSherrington: I don't think that kind of thing bothers him, and it shouldn't. Not exactly bulletin-board material. Sumlin didn't say it, and neither did any of the Aggies. At this point, Bielema has enough problems of his own. Neither Toledo nor Tech has nearly the defense that A&M does.\nClick here to view the entire chat transcription.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1496076&ThemeId=", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-09-25T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:07:47.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
