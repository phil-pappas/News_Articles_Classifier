Or the University of Florida.\nMike Ehrmann MIAMI GARDENS, FL - OCTOBER 20: Miami Hurricanes head coach Al Golden shakes hands with Florida State Seminoles head coach Jimbo Fisher after a game at Sun Life Stadium on October 20, 2012 in Miami Gardens, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) “I did single them out,” Bowden said this week. “We had to beat our in-state rivals.”\nNearly 40 years later, Jimbo Fisher has taken Bowden’s blueprint … and doubled down on it.\nFisher is 9-1 against his two in-state rivals during his five years as head coach, the best five-year stretch against Miami and Florida in school history. Bowden’s best was 7-3 from 1995-99.\nFlorida State Seminoles vs Miami Hurricanes 11-15-2014 “You are very well accepted during that time,” Bowden said. “Your booster dinners were larger. Your meetings were larger. Everyone was happy.\n“It was very important to win those games.”\nBut when Fisher replaced Bowden in 2010, Florida State had dropped its six previous games to Florida and 8 of 11 to Miami. Now, Fisher is looking for his 10th win against his in-state rivals Saturday when No. 12 Florida State (4-0, 2-0 ACC) hosts Miami (3-1, 0-0) at 8 p.m. (ABC).\nFisher’s success, though, has extended beyond state borders. FSU is 62-11 under Fisher and only Alabama has as many wins (62) during that span.\n(RELATED: Jimbo Fisher's journey from W. Va. coal miner's son to Florida State coach )\nAnd while Fisher, and every coach, will say every game, especially those within the conference, is important, he understands beating a rival can buy you a lot of goodwill.\n“I know the fans get the bragging rights and we know the importance of it,” said Fisher, who is 5-0 against Miami. “And I think the emotion of it is probably greater.\n“But for us when you win it, we say ‘it’s the next win’ and you move on.”\nHow impressive is 9-1? Dennis Erickson was at Miami for six years (1989-94) and was happy going 4-2 against the Seminoles. “I’ll take that any day of the week,” he said.\nErickson, currently the assistant head coach for No. 4 Utah, has been a part of several bitter in-state rivalries as a head coach at places such as Washington State, Oregon State and Arizona State.\n“You better win that game or you won’t be there long,” he said.\nThe two most successful coaches against their in-state rivals at Miami were Larry Coker, 8-0 from 2001-05, and Jimmy Johnson, 7-2 from 1984-88.\nButch Davis was an assistant on Johnson’s staff and the Miami head coach from 1995-2000. He was 1-6 against FSU, partly because of NCAA sanctions from previous infractions.\n“It’s huge,” Davis said of having success against the other two schools. “Especially in the state of Florida where most of the kids grow up and have watched all three of the programs and envision themselves playing for one of the three. It gives you credibility on the home visit.”\nAhhh, the recruiting angle. The lifeblood of any program.\nClose to 100 recruits are expected to be on the Doak Campbell Stadium sidelines Saturday, and Fisher’s success on the field has been a product of his prowess on the recruiting trail.\nIn the last five years, FSU’s average recruiting rank, according to 247Sports, is 4.6. Miami’s is 19.2 and Florida’s is 9.6.\nAnd some of FSU’s biggest recruits have come from Miami’s footprint.\nCraig Haubert, the recruiting coordinator for ESPN, believes Fisher’s recruiting success has as much to do with the Seminoles winning a national championship and 29 straight games from 2012-14 as it does from dominating Miami and Florida.\n“Kids do a good job of looking at more than one game, they look at the big picture,” Haubert said. “What you have to look at is not how Jimbo Fisher is doing against one school but how it’s going in general.”\nLuck and good timing can be as necessary as talent and coaching. In 2010, the stars were aligned in FSU’s favor.\nAt Florida, few believed Urban Meyer was in for the long haul after a bizarre couple of days late in 2009 when he resigned only to return a day later. Meyer then quit for good following the 2010 regular season and the program went into steep decline under Will Muschamp.\nAt Miami, Randy Shannon lasted four years before being fired in 2010. Al Golden was hired and soon after it was revealed booster Nevin Shapiro had been providing Hurricanes players with extra benefits for the last decade, leading to more NCAA woes.\n“The timing was perfect for Florida State,” Davis said.\nBut all coaches know, you better take advantage of those good times - which Fisher has at Florida State - because they won’t last forever.\n“I don’t see any of those guys staying down for very long,” Erickson said.\nSATURDAY’S GAME\nMiami at Florida State\n8 p.m., ABC\n</p", "external_links": ["http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/jimbofisher/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/275/img/photos/2014/11/16/04/88/111514_spt_um_vs_fsu01.JPG", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/07/36/b6/GettyImages-154488192.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:54:23.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
