Valore discovered her strength and voice as a participant in children’s theater; it was her vehicle on the wooden boards of the stage.\nInspired by the local scene more than anything mainstream, her preference leans on alternative music and is more deep than any of the rap you hear on the radio.\nWhat moves her? She replies with a smile: “Raw energy and what woos me? Exactly that.\n“I want my brain to be tickled first.”\nThen she begins to spit a rhyme at me ...\nValore is just 21 years old, so I asked in her opinion, what defines millennials?\n“Definitely social media. Seems to define most in my age bracket. I, too, am a victim of it,” she admits. “I find myself checking up on Instagram constantly. There is such information overload.”\nWhy is there such need?\n“It’s almost like a high,” she says. “Instant gratification. It’s right there in the palm of your hands.”\nWhat is her war song?\nWith eyes filled with pure melancholia, she responds: “I am tired of the [filtered word]-shaming. I am tired of women being seen as objects. I am tired of others hating. Lately I found most of my strength in the negative; it fuels me. I turn around and return a sick rhyme filled with positivity and love.”\nAnd so she begins to spit another rhyme ...\nODE TO THE 912\nSavannah is as slow as molasses\nWe’re all trapped in this\nSlow sultry swell\nThe elderly sit on the porch and dwell\nOn the humidity\nWe’re rooted to this town like the oak tree\nI don’t think I’ll ever break free\nFrom the hypnotizing dripping of the Spanish moss\nYour forehead has a gloss of sweat\nAs you tell me your regrets\nHow you took a bite of the sweetest of all the Georgia peaches\nAnd she left you in pieces\nBikes crammed in hallways\nThe churches always\nRinging every sunday\nThere’s enough steeples here to repent ever sinner ten-fold\nI’m told\nHowever my sanctuary is the swamp\nHow it never fails to haunt my bones\nThere’s this dark undertone\nResonating through the streets\nIf you listen carefully you can hear history’s heartbeat\nDiversity thriving in squares\nShare a pedicab with me\nAnd you’ll see from the scenery why so many people want to be stuck\nIn such a city\nTrolleys and sunshine\nCobblestone and fine wine\nTrendy fashion and horse-drawn carriages\nSaxophones and evangelical images\nForsyth a place for a spectrum of people\nMidnight in the garden of good and evil\nAs pretty as seems there are dark alleys\nShootings almost daily\nNumb to the police sirens\nAmbulances screaming, shining like diamonds\nBlack feral kittens adorning every doorstep\nSearching for someone to let them in\nTrying to sweep the streets of sin in the dark\nCan’t find a place to park\nWould Dr. King be proud of what MLK Boulevard has become?\nChildren holding up people with guns\nOrnate houses decayed and empty\nGlocks go well with blunts and 40s\nMothers begging at the DFCS for food stamps\nCan’t provide for a family cramping in hunger\nDirty kids don’t trust one another\nStabbing each other\nSipping whiskey as they lose sanity\nNot allowing people to play music unless they have a license\nLosing the essence of being free\nBy ticketing lovely strings\n18 but not allowed in bars\nFake IDs fill up jars\nGraduated from college with a degree\nDebt piled up to the ceiling\nGetting by waitressing\nArtists and gangsters\nTourists and travelers\nHippies and pastors\nYuppies and farmers\nAll together we strive to survive and thrive\nIn this microcosm divine\nLEARN MORE\nKeep up with Lady Valore’s performance schedule at www.facebook.com/ladyvalore.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821710.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZ8mc)", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821722.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821722.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZaur", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821710.jpg", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dosavannah/id626862925?ls=1&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n53744379", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/2Ix6dHF.png", "https://bit.ly/Ke006c"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:14:10.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
