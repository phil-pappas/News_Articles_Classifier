Both teams have eight points each. \nAfter a goalless first half, defender Saad Suhail put Oman ahead in the 52nd minute before the visitors levelled through Jalal Hosseini in the 70th minute. \nIn his remarks to Muscat Daily after the match, Habsi said, “We deserved three points, we were the best team on the pitch. We controlled the game and dominated a strong opponent like Iran.” \nAction from the Oman-Iran game on Thursday (Ahmed al Saidi/Muscat Daily) \nThe Oman goalie added, “It was a great performance that Oman can be proud of. There was one mistake from our side and we were penalised for that (conceding a goal). It is a lesson. Big teams like Iran grab any chance that they get and that's what they did here, even though we did not give them much room.” \nHabsi, who went into the match high in confidence after having recently led English Championship side Reading to a 2-0 win over Middlesborough, said, “Iran had only one ball in our box and they scored. They tried hard to put pressure through some long throw-ins into the box, but we defended well.” \n“It was perfect execution of coach Paul Le Guen's plan. We are happy to have picked up a point,” he said. \nThe Oman captain explained that the notable improvement in his team's display had much to do with the start of the OPL. \n“The players were rusty when they hosted Turkmenistan (3-1) and travelled to Guam (0-0) last month. But with the Oman players returning to club duty and having played a couple of matches, it reflected in the team's show against Iran,” he said. \nOn the upcoming clash against bottom-placed India, the 33 year old Habsi added, “We would like to continue our good form when we take on India on Tuesday. It is a big game and we are looking to pocket three points, which will keep us on track for qualification to the next round.” \nIndia has lost all the four matches it has played so far. \nAt the post-match press conference on Thursday, Oman coach Le Guen observed that 'it has been the best performance from these players over the past three or four years', adding, “We played a wonderful game and we should have won the match. I am proud of my boys.” \nThe coach is hoping that his players will recover in time for Tuesday's clash against India and said he was aiming for 'nothing less than a win at home'. \nOman was the better team, says Queiroz \nIran coach Carlos Queiroz conceded that Oman was the better team on the field, but lauded his players for their fighting spirit that helped the visitors troop out of the match with a point. \nThe Portuguese coach said the return game at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran early next year will be a totally different challenge for Oman. “I think we can have a positive result at home. So it is good to get a point here,” he said. \nThe draw retained Oman's positive track record against the Iranians, who haven't beaten the Red Warriors for 14 years now. \nAfter Tuesday's home game, Oman travels to Ashgabat to take on hosts Turmenistan on November 17. It will round off its campaign next year with back-to-back games, against Guam at home on March 24 and then away in Tehran on March 29.
