Trying to find a bright side of a since spoiled season Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders makes pass reception against Lions cornerback Darius Slay to the 15-yard line in Sunday's loss at Ford Field.

But that play essentially ended it. \nMore than likely, that play ended the Lions' season. Which is crazy, because it wasn't even October. \nSuch demoralizing losses hardly are uncommon around here. We've got a half-century of scars to prove it. \nYet there was something about the latest loss that felt particularly soul-crushing, maybe because the reasons don't matter anymore, because there always will be reasons. \nThese are the Lions, right? \nActually, these are your Lions. And there is nothing you can do about it. \nYou have to watch Matthew Stafford get knocked on his back, or miss open receivers when he's upright. You have to listen to Jim Caldwell tell you the team is close, even though the team hasn't been close to winning in the first three weeks. \nYou have to read that opponents are telling Golden Tate the offense is predictable, that they know what's coming. That is embarrassing, though plenty of other teams tip their hands without realizing it. It's called film study. But only your team turns it into an \"Oh, God, what now?\" Lions' Caldwell: We're close, even if you can't see it \nYou have to live with the fact that Calvin Johnson is 30 and not quite the same athlete he was, and why does it matter anyway? They can't get him the ball. \nYou have to put up with an offensive line that doesn't push forward and struggles to create a safe pocket for Stafford. And you have to deal with reports from Miami, where Ndamukong Suh is wasting away on a bad team, when he could have been alienating people and terrorizing quarterbacks for your team. \nSo what if he lost his cool once in a while? He changed the defense. \nNow look at it. \nUncertain where to go, whether to watch, whether to give yourself to this team for another weekend. \nAnd the leaves haven't even turned. \nLook, I'm not here to remind you of what you already know. I'm here to say it can be OK anyway. Not because the Lions will get to the Super Bowl this year — don't be silly. Not because they will beat the Seahawks this Monday night in Seattle. \nNot because you will tune in hoping for a miracle — you know you will — for this squad to become just the fourth in league history to make the playoffs after starting 0-3. No, I'm telling you it will be OK because there is another way. \nIt's time to embrace the tragedy. Give the pathos a hug. Let the bitterness wash away and discover amusement in the decades of folly. \nIn short, I'm asking you to become — French, at least for Sundays in the fall. Laugh at the pain. It's easier than you think. \nFor example, the Lions wasted the primes of two of the most gifted players in league history. First Barry Sanders. Now Johnson. \nCan't you see the humor in that? \nYou should. You'll feel better. \nYou also should feel proud: A lifetime of Lions fandom is too much for most sports fans to handle. Just last Sunday, you had to watch Slay get beat not once, but twice, down the same sideline. Most fans would have imploded. Not you. You're still here. \nJust like you were still there after that botched pass interference call January in Dallas. Heck, that noncall is what makes you unique, what makes you a survivor. You vented briefly, then focused on the Lions' return to the playoffs, and that they played reasonably well. \nThat's why you were so psyched for this season, even without Ndamukong Suh, because, again, you believed. \nWhere'd that get you? \nTo last Sunday night? In a state of despondency as you watched another season implode before it really began? \nHow Lions. \nAnd how unfortunate, when you could be bemused, even ironically detached. Come on. Give it a shot. The oppressiveness finally might lift, because it sure isn't likely to this Monday. \nUnless the Lions win. \nAt which point I can no longer help you. \nContact Shawn Windsor: 313-222-6487 or swindsor@freepress.com.
