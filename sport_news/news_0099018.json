Portland could spend an estimated $1 million annually to monitor and license the industry.\n\"It's regulatory overkill,\" Saltzman said.\nPortland will begin accepting applications for recreational marijuana licenses on Dec. 1, but those businesses aren't expected to open until late 2016.\n-- Andrew Theen\natheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:09:58.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
