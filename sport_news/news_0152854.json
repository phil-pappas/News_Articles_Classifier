What do you think? Log in and start commenting \nThe 24-year-old, who moved on to Brentford from the Banks’s before a successful loan spell at MK Dons led to a £1million move to Wigan, lined up against a number of former team-mates on Saturday. \nThe Northern Ireland international was the subject of loud jeers from the away end which quickly turned to ironic cheers as the striker missed a couple of clear-cut second-half opportunities. \nBut Grigg’s former boss wants to credit the Walsall youth system for producing that level of player. \nSmith said:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:02:20.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
