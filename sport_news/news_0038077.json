(Photo by Carl Elmore/For the Savannah Morning News) Back | Next Carl Elmore/For the Savannah Morning News\nAlthough Savannah High receiver Joseph Barrett (14) caught the ball, Jenkins defender Timothy Leeks (11) pushed him out of bounds before the pass could be completed.\nBack | Next Carl Elmore/For the Savannah Morning News\nJenkins quarterback Javonte Middleton (7) slips past Savannah High’s Rasheen Biggins (12) for a touchdown.\nBy TRAVIS JAUDON Jenkins used every weapon available to dominate Savannah High to the tune of a 47-7 win Friday night at Memorial Stadium, scoring seven touchdowns on their first nine possessions en route to the victory.\nArkeem Byrd got things going when the senior running back scored on a handoff from 48 yards out thanks to a few nifty moves and excellent blocking up front. The Warriors’ first drive would set the tone for the rest of the game as Jenkins went 88-yards on just eight plays on its opening drive.\nSavannah High moved the ball well on its first drive before being forced to punt from around midfield, but Jenkins returner Tim Leeks fumbled inside the Warrior 30-yard line, and Savannah pounced on the loose ball. The Blue Jackets were driving again before a blind-side sack caused a fumble that was recovered by Jenkins.\nJavonte Middleton scored the second Warrior touchdown by running seven yards up the middle after keeping the ball on a read option. Later in the quarter, Leeks, a senior receiver, hauled in a strike from Middleton off a wheel route and then broke two tackles before sprinting 78 yards to put the Warriors up 21-0 midway through the second quarter.\nThe first half scoring was capped off by Jenkins when sophomore Ameen Stevens took a shotgun handoff from Middleton and ran eight yards up the gut to give the Warriors a 28-0 halftime advantage.\nJenkins coach Tim Adams has had his share of great offenses throughout his time at the school, but he admitted after the game that this offense might be special.\n“Yes. As far as depth at each position goes.” Adams said when asked if this offense is the best one he’s coached. “We have a lot of different weapons. We have a lot of guys that can do a lot of things.”\nJenkins (5-2, 3-0) scored seven touchdowns with seven different players on the evening.\nMiddleton once again spread the ball around from receiver to receiver, hitting six different Warriors in the game. The young quarterback threw two interceptions on the night, but that didn’t make him gun-shy in the slightest.\nMiddleton was 15 of 23 passing with two touchdowns along with 235 passing yards, his favorite target being Leeks, who caught four balls in the game, tallying 103 yards receiving and a touchdown. Jamonte Roberts chipped in two catches for 56 yards while sophomore Tyrone Scott had three catches for 19 yards and a touchdown.\nThe Warriors led 47-0 after three quarters of play and began using mass substitutions from that point on, but Savannah High scored a touchdown early in the fourth quarter thanks to a lengthy drive finished off by a Jaquan Chism 3-yard touchdown rush.\nSavannah High (2-6, 1-3) was aggressive passing the ball throughout the first half, and while they had some success moving the chains, the Blue Jackets didn’t manage to find the end zone until their 10th possession of the game.\nJenkins, which has now won three straight games, will have a tough region test next week on the road at Southeast Bulloch. Adams and the Warriors haven’t forgotten a tough loss at home to SEB last season, and they plan on being ready for revenge next Friday.\n“It’s a big showdown next week,” Adams said. “Southeast Bulloch will run it right at you, so it’s no secret how they play. It’s gut-check time for us.”\nJenkins 7 21 19 0—47\nTattnall 0 0 0 7—7\nJ—Arkeem Byrd 48 rush (Michael Greco kick)\nJ—Javonte Middleton seven rush (Greco kick)\nJ—Tim Leeks 78 reception from Middleton (Greco kick)\nJ—Ameen Stevens eight rush (Greco kick)\nJ—Melvin Smalls Jr. 25 rush (kick failed)\nJ—Tyrone Scott six reception from Middleton (Greco kick)\nJ—Kenneth Morman 82 rush (kick failed)\nSH—Jaquan Chism three rush (Rashad Denmark kick)", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14816542.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14816544.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14816543.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14816542.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14816544.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14816543.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:20:27.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
