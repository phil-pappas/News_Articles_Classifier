While her 2014 victory in the 2,400-meter (2,600-yard) event capped a disappointing year marred by physical problems, Treve is currently at the top of her form. \nThe daughter of Motivator, who was nearly retired after last year's Arc, has won the three races she competed in this season — including a six-length win at the Prix Vermeille last month. \n\"I feel she's better than last year,\" Head-Maarek said. \"She is back to her best, that's for sure. Last season her feet were not right and then her back was all over the place. It is never easy with a horse which has problems. There has been no problem this year.\" \nTreve's main rivals in the likely 18-horse field are Andre Fabre's French Derby winner New Bay and Frankie Dettori's mount Golden Horn, who won the Derby at Epsom. Despite Treve's outstanding form and record at Longchamp, Golden Horn owner Anthony Oppenheimer is confident the expected dry conditions will play in favor of his colt. \n\"If we had good to firm ground, I think we'd win easily. I think we've got a great chance,\" he said. \"Treve is not that mad on really good ground and is not that brilliant. I would be very surprised if we couldn't beat her and beat her quite well — that's on good ground, not soft.\" \nOppenheimer's comments left Jarnet unfazed. \n\"Yes, he wins like a good horse, like a tough horse, but now he has run many times already this season and we will see if the Arc might not be one race too many for him,\" Jarnet said. \nBecause of the smaller than usual field in Sunday's race and to improve her horse's chances, Head-Maarek has supplemented a pacemaker for Treve in Shahah. \nThe race will be the last in Longchamp before a two-year refurbishment of the racecourse gets underway, with next year's Grand Prix de l'Arc being held in Chantilly. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:54:38.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
