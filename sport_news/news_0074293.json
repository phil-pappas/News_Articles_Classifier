There are guys who have one good season out of 20. Some of them not even one good. I'm entitled. I don't need to prove. \n\"I live in a different world. I'm not with the power. I'm a lonely guy in this modern world of football. I do my work. I'm not a politician, I'm not a PR, I don't care what people think about me. I don't, you know, I'm just what I am. \n\"When I am in a great moment it looks like nothing's happened; when I am in a bad moment, I pay for this a little bit. I don't have many friends in the football world.\" \nMourinho has won titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain while also claiming Champions League glory with Porto and Inter, and he followed a treble success in his homeland in 2003 with another in Milan seven years later. \n\"I think my career is not normal. I think it is not normal because I won so much, and consecutively. That's not normal,\" he added. \n\"What is happening to me after 15 years should have happened before. It's not normal, not normal. In 15 years, in only one did I not win a major title. In 15 years I won 22 major titles. It's too much. \n\"I learn to be happy with the happiness of the others,\" added Mourinho sarcastically. \"But I repeat, it's a moment. It's not a moment that will last for a long time. \n\"In football there is a culture. I'm not sure of the right word in English - but I think it is 'vulture'. The culture of the vulture. \n\"When they feel something can happen, they start circling. To criticise someone with my history, you need to be brave. There is a risk someone like myself with say 'Shut up. You've won nothing', but I won't do that.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:14:22.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
