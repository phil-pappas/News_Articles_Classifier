Mercer and other family members, including estranged wife Khloe Kardashian, are now in Las Vegas. \nThe statement says, \"His complete healing is paramount and our primary focus.\" \nOdom remains hospitalized in Las Vegas after being found unconscious Tuesday at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nKhloe Kardashian said her family won't be posting content online while attending to estranged husband Lamar Odom's health crisis after he was found unconscious Tuesday at the Love Ranch brothel in Nevada. \nKardashian's rep confirmed Friday that the message on the reality TV star's official app was posted by the family. \nIt read: \"As a family, we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar.\" \nThe message was addressed to fans as a note from Kardashian.
