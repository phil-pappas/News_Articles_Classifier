Two proved to be a blessing in a hard-fought 2-1 Vikings victory. \nCape moved to 6-0, but was scored upon for the first time in 2015. \nAli Bishop, Lake Forest's goalie, is the great equalizer and game changer. She is going to keep Lake in the game and give the team a chance at the end of games. \nCape showed up and played well with an incredible 49 shots on goal and 26 corners, but only scored twice - once late in the first half as Alia Marshall poked one through traffic and early in the second stanza when Katie Frederick whacked an elevated soft toss from Sydney Ostroski into the back of the cage for a more comfortable 2-0 lead at Lake. \nSpeedy forward Mya Maddox got control of a bouncing ball off a corner and found the back of the cage with 20:56 remaining to cut the lead to 2-1, and it was game on for the final 20 minutes. \n“Our team goal against Cape was to score a goal, and my job was to stop a bunch of shots,” Bishop said after the game. \nBishop got the attention of powerful Delmar Sept. 24, saving 23 shots as the Spartans stunned the favored Wildcats on their own turf to escape town with a 2-2 overtime tie. \n“We played really well today,” said Cape coach Kate Austin. “Annie Judge [defensive midfielder] was everywhere, and Erin [Coverdale], Tess [Bernheimer] and Alia [Marshall] in the midfield were great, and Katie [Klabe], Jody [Boyer] and Anna [Steiner] gave us quality minutes off the bench.\" \nCape senior defensive enforcer Lizzie Frederick just shrugged after the game, \"They were pretty good, and we’re getting out of here with a win.” The message is, “Don’t get spoiled” in spite of a Windett/Austin record of 61-1-1 since taking over three years ago. \nCape travels 93 miles to powerhouse South River in Edgewater, Md., Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Go over the Bay Bridge, take Exit 23 off Route 50 and start talking to your navigator - human or digital.
