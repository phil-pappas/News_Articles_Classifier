I was a complete mess at that age,\" said Biles, who was adopted by her grandparents 15 years ago after her mother struggled with drug and alcohol addiction.\n\"I didn’t have any discipline, so I’m glad I was not old enough (to compete in London). It turned out for the better.\"\nFOUR-YEAR CYCLE\nHer date of birth meant she became a senior at the start of an Olympic cycle, meaning if she wanted to have a shot at Olympics glory, she would have to sustain her levels of excellence for a full four years -- a stretch that is beyond most elite gymnasts.\n\"One of things we faced with her becoming a senior just after the 2012 Olympics was that nobody has ever sustained (being on top) that long. You can’t come out on top in your first year and expect to stay on top,\" explained Boorman.\n\"So it’s been a balancing act of keeping her healthy and making sure she has fun.\"\nThe fun factor she enjoys in training has also ensured Biles does not suffer a fate many Olympic-bound champions fear -- that of \"peaking too soon\".\n\"That’s just a stat that’s been placed into everybody’s head that you can peak too soon. We have a peaking pace and I think my pace is just fine. I don’t think I have peaked yet,\" said Biles, who has amassed nine medals, including six golds in just two world championships.\n\"We’re all glad that we have a little bit of time to get ready (for next year's Rio Games).\n\"Are we anxious? Sometimes the thinking time … like we’d wish it would come and go so it’s over so we don’t have to think about it any more.\n\"But we’re all glad for the time we have to wait it out and embrace the moments we have left before it all hits us and happens.\"\n(Editing by Neville Dalton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:31:06.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
