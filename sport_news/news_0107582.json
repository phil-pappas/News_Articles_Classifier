Dave Frockt is hoping to make progress on Extreme Risk legislation when the Legislature convenes next year.\ncomment (11)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:58:23.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
