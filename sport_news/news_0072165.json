(Jean-Christophe Bott / KEYSTONE via AP) \nMONACO (AP) — Track and field’s governing body says it will provide $22 million over a four-year period to its national federations. \nIAAF President Sebastian Coe says each national federation will receive $25,000 a year as part of the “IAAF Olympic Athletics Dividend.” \nCoe says the funds represent about one-half of the revenues which the IAAF receives from the IOC during each four-year Olympic cycle. \nThe funding plan was one of the main promises of Coe’s IAAF election campaign. He was elected in August, defeating Sergei Bubka to succeed Lamine Diack. \nThe money is aimed at helping national bodies develop the sport in their countries. \nCoe says “the IAAF must engage and work together with its members, listen to their needs and implement tailored solutions at a local and regional level.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:10:32.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
