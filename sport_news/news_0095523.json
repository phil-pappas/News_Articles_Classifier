The victory guarantees the first A-Sun postseason game at Hodges Stadium since 2009. Drew Spragg netted his third goal of the season with just 5:02 remaining in the first half to aid the Ospreys in their second-straight win over the Dolphins. It marks the first time North Florida secured back-to-back victories over Jacksonville since the 2002 and 2003 seasons. \"Any time you play in a rivalry game like this you throw out the records and I have to credit to JU, it was a battle tonight,\" said Head Coach . \"We're just excited we come in, get a win, get the cup and get another three points in conference. What we're really looking forward to is competing for a regular season championship next Saturday.\" Jay Bolt just six minutes prior to the game-deciding score.
