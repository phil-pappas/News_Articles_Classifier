Putting is getting better, and then I finish with birdie (on three) out of like the last four holes. So it's always a good sign to make lots of birdies out there,\" she said. \nTseng had six birdies and one bogey to card a 66 in the first round Thursday. \nTseng, whose last victory came in March 2012, came excruciatingly close a month and half ago when she finished as the runner-up at the Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic, and being in contention again seems to suit her. \n\"Just feel very comfortable,\" Tseng said. \"Just very happy to be back in position, see my name on the first page of the leaderboard.\" \nAnother Taiwanese player, Candie Kung (龔怡萍), was tied for 14th at 5-under 137 after a second-round 3-under 68, and Hsu Wei-ling (徐微凌) was tied for the 37th at 1-under 141 after a 3-under 68 on Friday that was marred only by a bogey on the final hole. \nLee Min was tied for 61st in the 75-player field at 4-over.
