It is the golden age of a football player - 27 to 32 - the age when you know your job. \n\"When you are under 25, you think you can last forever. Once you get to 27 you realise it is time to capitalise on what you have learned and efficiency takes a little bit over the playing mood. \n\"You realise suddenly that it is not only important to play, it is important to win as well. \n\"Mesut is focused on his job. Talent-wise, I think deeply he is a very, very collective player. He is a very respectful guy. If you tell him to do that, he will do it for you. \n\"Mesut plays in the link between the low midfield and the striker. He is the vital part in that. When he has the ball in the final part of the pitch, he has the most assists. \n\"Sometimes I think he sacrifices himself for the team, and I think his talent is exceptional.\" \nWenger believes his side have overcome the mental frailties have cost them a sustained title challenge in recent seasons. \n\"We have strengthened our belief with our run last season. From January, you could feel there was really a change in our stability,\" he said. \n\"We have shown that we can handle the pressure. What is the most important for me is to continue to develop as a team, to feel that we grow in the quality of our game. \n\"We have maybe a better discipline. People reproached us many times saying 'OK, Arsenal play football, but they are a bit fragile'. Before, maybe, when we were not dominating completely the game, we were a bit insecure. \n\"We are more mature, for sure Two years ago, we were a long time top of the league. After, we lost one or two players and we lost one or two big games, and that was the killer for us. \n\"I feel today we are better prepared. We know, as well, the competition will be long.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:28:44.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
