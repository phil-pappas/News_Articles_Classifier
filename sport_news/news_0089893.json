It doesn't really matter what Franklin says after any game, at 5-1 his team is behind schedule.\nThere's a chance, of course, to immediately turn that around. Nobody realistically had the Nits at 7-0 after the Ohio State game. The way to make your paying customers forget that you lost a game they thought you'd win is to win a game they thought you'd lose.\nIf you're being asked to judge Penn State solely on results - which is basically what Franklin has done - then the Nittany Lions have to get a win from the Ohio State, Michigan State or Michigan games right? With the Temple loss on the books, how can this season be judged a real success any other way?\nMore coverage Latest college sports videos SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise It's not like the top-ranked Buckeyes have looked particularly top-ranked so far. Northern Illinois had a shot at them. So did Indiana. That actually could be a problem for the visiting team Saturday night in Columbus. Urban Meyer's bunch could use a big-time showing, too.\n(Side note: If, say, Iowa had the exact same results as the Buckeyes right now, you think the Hawkeyes would be top-ranked?) Not that Ohio State still can't repeat its national title. Ezekiel Elliott has put himself in the Heisman conversation and the OSU QBs are doing just fine and Braxton Miller has turned out to be a legit receiver as an H-back.\nAnother offshoot of the Temple loss is that it reduced the buzz around OSU-PSU. This week, Michigan-Michigan State is the big one in the Big Ten, to see who is the big rival for the Buckeyes this season. So far, Michigan has passed the eye test most often.\nFor Penn State, a November home date with Michigan might represent the better chance to make a big statement, strictly looking at the odds. But a road upset over a top-ranked team? The Temple game would really be dead and buried.\nThis may be the last time we'll point out Franklin has had success as an underdog. Vandy beat Florida, Georgia and Tennessee in 2013, after beating Auburn, Mississippi and Tennessee in 2012. None of that is supposed to happen. Did Franklin's team catch some of those schools in down years? Absolutely. None of those 2012 victims ended up with winning SEC records. Only Georgia did of the 2013 victims, at 5-3.\nIt still doesn't diminish what happened down there. Georgia and Florida and Auburn simply are never supposed to lose to Vandy. The Gators lost at home 34-17? Not too many of Franklin's Vandy players turned down offers from Florida or Georgia or Auburn. Franklin certainly won some recruiting battles but he built a better team than those other schools in those years, one that performed better on the field.\nPenn State fans know all that and probably don't care about it much anymore. Penn State is not an underdog program. At the least, it's in the company of Georgia and Florida and Auburn, not Vandy.\nFor Franklin, if it is only results that matter, the Horseshoe on Saturday offers the greatest opportunity of his career.\nThat's enough context, time for a football game.\nmjensen@phillynews.com\n@jensenoffcampus", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=collegegearArticle&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fpages%2FCOLLEGE"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:18:20.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
