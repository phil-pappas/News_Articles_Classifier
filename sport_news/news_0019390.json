Anglers who happened to be in the right place, such as Sea Bright, Monmouth Beach and Long Branch, were lucky enough to find nice bass feeding on adult bunker.\nThe fish fell for poppers, shads and snagged-and-dropped bunker. Bob Matthews at Fisherman’s Den in Belmar said word started drifting in on Wednesday afternoon about bass off the Monmouth County beaches. He said the boats were doing well snagging and dropping.\nMatthews also said that Capt. George Steller of the Teri Jean out of Belmar trolled up 10 stripers up to 32 pounds. Anglers Mike Reagan landed a 32 pounder and Jonny Hasse had one at 31 pounds.\nMatthews also got a call on Tuesday that there were false albacore in the surf at Sandy Hook. He said the Shark River is moving into the fall fishery with flounder biting there. One angler, he said, got his limit on one cast catching two keeper flounder at the same time.\nThe blackfish are hitting in the Shark River Inlet and Point Pleasant Canal and there’s no problem getting your one-fish limit. Offshore, the tuna bite is red hot, Matthews said, with bigeye, yellowfin, longfin and swordfish all being caught.\nErnie Giglio at Giglio’s Bait and Tackle in Sea Bright said the bass were there Wednesday and Thursday with Bill Bertsch, Red Bank, weighing in a 23 1 / 2 pounder he caught off the beach on a popper.\nErnie also reported that the albies were thick in the surf in Sea Bright on Wednesday morning with some anglers catching up to eight of the speedsters. Crippled Herring and Deadly Dicks were catching the fish.\nOutdoor writer Allen Riley was on the Sea Bright beach early Thursday and reported that bass were blowing up on bunker there. He got one, but said there were fish all around.\nRonny Bala at Fisherman’s Supply in Point Beach said the fishing really opened up this week. On the beaches surf guys are catching striped bass, bluefish and weakfish. The anglers trolling umbrella rigs and bunker spoons have found bass up to 30 pounds around the Shrewsbury Rocks and the Seaside piers, he said.\nSteve Gremminger at Creekside Outfitters in Waretown said anglers are still picking blowfish in Barnegat Bay. The bite has slowed down somewhat but most fish are nice size at 12 and 13 inches. The small blues are still hanging around the Barnegat Inlet and anglers are starting to pick up more stripers off the jetty there.\nGremminger said anglers have had luck using Tsunami plastic eels for the bass. One angler got towed around in his kayak fishing on the bayside of Island Beach State Park when he landed a 48-pound bass, Gremminger said.\nThe 61st Annual Long Beach Island Surf Classic got off to a great start when Merle Van Liere caught a 34-pound striper in the Beach Haven surf. It was the first bass caught in the contest and earned Van Liere the $500 cash prize and an autographed football by Philadelphia Eagles’ players Lane Johnson and Brandon Graham.\nVan Liere also has the fish to beat as the tournament enters its second week. There are 415 anglers signed up for the island-wide contest.\nJohn Oswald: joswald@gannettnj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:07:59.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
