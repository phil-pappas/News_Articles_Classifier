Maggie Bean Oct 18, 2015 at 2:14p ET 0Shares \nWith a little more than three weeks before the first exhibition game of the 2015-16 season, Marquette held an instrasquad scrimmage on Saturday afternoon. Not only did it give the Golden Eagles live full-court competition, it also gave them a chance to get adjusted to the new rule changes for this year, as the scrimmage included three officials. \nAmong the highlights from Saturday's action was a pair of buzzer-beating buckets from heralded freshman forward Henry Ellenson. \nAt the end of the second scrimmage, fellow freshman Haanif Cheatham switched onto Ellenson off a pick-and-roll. Ellenson took advantage of the mismatch, powering the ball inside for a last-second lay-in. true A video posted by Marquette Basketball (@marquette.basketball) on Oct 17, 2015 at 11:19am PDT \nIn the finale, the 6-foot-10 Ellenson showcased his mid-range game, knocking down a controversial game-winning shot from the right elbow as time expired. true A video posted by Marquette Basketball (@marquette.basketball) on Oct 17, 2015 at 12:22pm PDT \nThe Golden Eagles host Valley City State, an NAIA program, on Nov.9. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:46:21.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
