H e most probably regrets it. \n\"Let's be fair, if you look at his track record where ever he's been, you don't become a bad manager after 10 games, I do the hospitality at the club and I've not seen too many people at Chelsea moaning and groaning. \n\"Maybe they are disappointed with the results, but I'm sure Jose will turn that around.\" \nFormer Chelsea midfielder Gus Poyet launched a passionate defence of Mourinho. \n\"It's not the problem of any one person,\" Poyet told Sportsweek. \"You cannot take all praise when you win and you can't be criticised for everything when you lose. \n\"Normally in England unfortunately we go for the head of the manager, but, if you haven't been on the touchline, you don't know how you feel in certain situations. We only look at the bad things. \n\"I do like Mourinho and I have no doubt he will keep his job.\" \nChelsea Supporters' Trust chairman Tim Rolls says Mourinho retains the backing of the fans, saying: \"My message would be keep calm and keep the faith. There's no pressure from supporters for him to go and I've still got faith he will turn it around.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:20:50.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
