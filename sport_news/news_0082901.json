TODAY \nNo. 6 Wayne Hills (4-0) at No. 2 Pascack Valley (3-0), 6 \nStory line : The Patriots have won their first four games by an average margin of 39 points, yet know this is the game they must win to legitimize themselves as a sectional title contender. Pascack Valley – which has won the past two North 1, Group 4 titles – is 4-0 against Wayne Hills since the teams began playing regularly in 2012, including a sectional semifinal victory in longtime Wayne Hills coach Chris Olsen’s last game that season.\nThe pick : Pascack Valley\nNo. 5 Passaic Tech (3-0) at No. 4 Hackensack (2-1), 7 \nStory line : Passaic Tech’s defense has resumed its dominance this season. The Bulldogs, led by senior DT Isiah Tolbert (four tackles for losses, 2½ sacks, three fumble recoveries) and junior MLB Ahzir McGuire (23 tackles, six for losses), have allowed just 11 points in 12 quarters this season during easy victories over Eastside, Passaic and Kennedy. They’ll attempt to win their eighth straight against Hackensack since 2009.\nThe pick : Hackensack\nNo. 1 St. Joseph (4-0) at IMG (Fla.) Academy (4-0), 7 \nStory line : The Bradenton-based school is a veritable high school All-Star team, so this will be the Green Knights’ toughest challenge of the season. The St. Joseph defense has been outstanding through the first month against quality competition, so that unit has to keep the Green Knights in the game.\nThe pick : IMG\nNo. 11 Lakeland (2-1) at No. 14 Indian Hills (3-0), 6 \nStory line : The unbeaten Braves want to prove their tremendous start isn’t a fluke in this important Big North National Division game. Indian Hills has averaged 48.7 points per game thanks largely to senior QB Tim O’Brien (789 passing yards, 14 TDs) – but against teams that are a combined 1-10. Senior QB Danny Mullin (568 passing yards, eight TDs) has led Lakeland to two lopsided victories since losing its opener to Paramus. The pick : Lakeland\nMountain Lakes (2-1) at No. 15 Boonton (3-0), 7 \nStory line : Boonton is 0-9 against Mountain Lakes since the Bombers last beat the Herd in 2005. Mountain Lakes has outscored Boonton, 326-56, in those nine games. Overcoming the mental obstacle of beating Mountain Lakes is as important as the North 1, Group 1 power points the unbeaten Bombers would gain by beating an elite Morris County team that has gone 98-8 and won four state championships since 2006. The pick : Boonton\nGlen Rock (2-1) at No. 10 Waldwick/Midland Park (3-0), 7 \nStory line : There are big North 1, Group 2 playoff implications here. The Panthers have picked up two straight quality wins to announce themselves as contenders, but the pressure will be on their defense to put the clamps on an offense that has generated 158 points in three games.\nThe pick : Waldwick/Midland Park\nBergenfield (2-1) at No. 19 Paramus (2-2), 7 \nStory line : This could be the turning point of the season for both teams in North 1, Group 3. The Bears are riding a two-game winning streak and seem to have found themselves, while the Spartans have to prove that they can survive losing their starting quarterback, Chris Regalbuto, to a season-ending injury. The pick : Paramus\nRidgefield Park (3-1) at No. 20 Westwood (2-1), 7 \nStory line : The Cardinals saw their 20-game winning streak come to a crashing halt last week, and it will be interesting to see how a relatively young team bounces back. The Scarlets haven’t beaten Westwood since 2011, so this is another statement game that will set the stage for the rest of the season. The pick : Ridgefield Park\nSATURDAY \nNo. 4 Paramus Catholic (1-2) at No. 3 Bergen Catholic (2-2), 2:30 \nStory line : After going a combined 1-4 in their early-season out-of-state schedules – albeit against some of the best competition in the country – both the Paladins and Crusaders will kick off Big North United play in need of a win. It'll be BC's high-powered offense – engineered by senior QB Jarrett Guarantano and senior TE Korab Idrizi – against a dangerous PC defense, featuring senior DL Rashan Gary and junior LB Drew Singleton. PC, which had two weeks to prepare following a bye, has humbled the Crusaders the past two years, outscoring them, 88-13. BC freshman RB/S Josh McKenzie (hip) has been cleared to play the past two weeks, according to coach Nunzio Campanile, yet has seen only a handful of snaps. But “he's getting close,” Campanile said. The pick : Paramus Catholic\nPark Ridge (3-0) at No. 16 Saddle Brook (3-0), 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:28:23.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
