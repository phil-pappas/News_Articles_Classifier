They have made the playoffs in all seven years of their existence. \nWith Sunday's other results, the Sounders are the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference. They will play host to No. 5 seed and defending MLS Cup champion Los Angeles in a knockout game on Wednesday or Thursday. \nDempsey put the Sounders on the board in the fifth minute when he met a cross from Obafemi Martins at the top right corner of the 6-yard box and sent it into the net while falling to the turf. It was his ninth goal of the year. \nMarco Pappa scored in the 10th minute off of a cross from Dempsey. In the 20th Dempsey made it 3-0 when he buried the rebound of a hard shot by Martins. \nLuis Gill scored in the 77th minute for Salt Lake (11-15-8, 41 points), which missed the playoffs after seven straight appearances. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:08:08.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
