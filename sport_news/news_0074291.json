What pressure?\nThe young Cubs players say they aren't feeling it as Game 3 of the NLCS approaches with the Mets leading 2-0.\n\"We're ready for a challenge and it will make the story that much better,\" rookie third baseman Kris Bryant said Monday after the Cubs worked out at Wrigley Field.\n\"Being down in so many games (and coming back during the season) really builds us up to this point. It isn't that much different to us. It is a different stage, it is the playoffs, it is October. So, sure, it's a little bit different. But we have been in a similar position before.\"\nManager Joe Maddon has advocated repeatedly this season that he doesn't want his players to allow the pressure to exceed the pleasure. Now, more than ever, those words will be tested.\n\"I'd just rather attempt to go out and win (Tuesday's) game, that's it. I don't want them to think about it in any other way, shape or form,\" Maddon said. \"It's about Tuesday. I've been repeating the same mantra the whole way through. We need to put together several one-game winning streaks. If we keep it one game at a time, we've a good shot of doing it.\n\"If you want to get into that result-oriented method of thinking, it's not going to play. So I'm really happy our guys have adopted that method.\"\nRight-hander Kyle Hendricks, who will start Tuesday night, has bought into his manager's positive thinking.\n\"I mean, yeah, there's pressure. It's the playoffs,\" Hendricks said. \"There's always going to be some pressure, but you've got to let the pleasure exceed that. We've heard Joe say it a lot. I'm just going to go out and try to have fun. This is why you play the game, this is why you want the ball. So pressure in a way is sometimes a good thing.\"\nMaddon had music from the movie \"Rocky\" blaring when the Cubs left the clubhouse Sunday night in New York.\n\"He does something different every day,\" Bryant said. \"That makes it fun coming to play here. He has definitely been a great leader for us and he's not panicking, so none of us are.\"\nBench coach Dave Martinez is trying to reassure youngsters such as Kyle Schwarber, Javier Baez, Jorge Soler and Bryant to remain calm in the face of the 2-0 deficit.\n\"We're still in good shape; we're back home and we have three games here,\" Martinez said. \"We play well here and (the young players) know that. I walked in the clubhouse today and they are loose as ever. They are enjoying the moment.\n\"We treat every day like Wednesday. We're pretty good on Wednesdays.\"\nThe Cubs beat the Pirates in the one-game wild-card playoff on a Wednesday.\nBryant said he is looking forward to warmer weather and a warm reception from the Wrigley Field fans.\n\"I love hitting here, I love playing in front of the fans here,\" Bryant said. \"We all do. It's a nice change of scenery after two games there. I am excited to see how we play, and I think it will be a lot better than it was.\"\nfmitchell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kicker34\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Kris Bryant Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon Jorge Soler Kyle Hendricks Kyle Schwarber", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625c370/turbine/ct-cubs-young-players-pressure-spt-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:13:06.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
