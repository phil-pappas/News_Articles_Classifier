Me and Pacquiao used to train together as well, spar together.\n“We are friends but sometimes, you know, friends have to fight each other.\n“I think it can happen. It’s all about just doing the little things, contracts and stuff.\n“I have left it to my team, my team are taking care of it, it’s a good fight for me.”\nKhan was speaking at the same venue where Manny Pacquiao had visited on Thursday.\nDuring that visit, Pacquiao confirmed he was in negotiations with the 28-year-old Briton and Floyd Mayweather for what would probably be the final fight of his career.\nThe Filipino said any fight, whoever the opponent, would probably take place in late March or early April 2016.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:11:02.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
