Schorzman Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 12:01 AM » Social News SPRINGFIELD — Forget the 451 yards rushing No. 1-ranked Springfield piled up Friday night in its 44-21 victory against No. 7 Ashland. Forget Trever Watson’s 249 yards rushing and two touchdowns or that Nicolas Ah Sam had 123 yards on the ground and three scores. What the Millers — 7-0 for the first time in school history — want people to know is they are on Team Jesse. Wearing orange undershirts and socks, Springfield improved to 3-0 in the Midwestern League, setting up a de facto league title game next Friday at Silke Field against Crater (7-0, 3-0). But as the final seconds ticked off against the Grizzlies, the stadium announcer said what players and coaches reflected afterward: This one was for Jesse Aguilar-Rodriguez, a Springfield senior lineman who was diagnosed with leukemia last February and who has been fighting for his life in a hospital room at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland. “It’s so much more important,” Watson said. “So much more than a game.” Springfield coach Dave Heuberger, wearing a navy blue shirt with “Team Jesse” written in orange, said he’s changed how he’s coached because of Aguilar-Rodriguez, a junior varsity lineman last season for the Millers. Heuberger said he didn’t know much about him, and in hindsight that’s disappointing. “And then when he gets sick I find out how great of a kid he is,” Heuberger said. “Are you kidding me? “He was sitting here in my program and I didn’t know how phenomenal he was.” In the months since Aguilar-Rodriguez was hospitalized, Heuberger said he and other Springfield officials have made the trip to Portland to visit him and his family. Watson said he texts every now and then with his classmate. Lately, Heuberger said, Aguilar-Rodriguez has started physical therapy. “You just sit back and look at that kid,” Heuberger said, “Jesse has given these kids a gift. He’s showed them courage.” After the game, after the Millers held Ashland to 87 yards rushing and ripping off 20-unanswered points to pull away from the Grizzlies (5-2, 1-2), it was clear Heuberger thought Jesse’s fight was more important. That’s why he spoke more easily about a teenager battling cancer than how his team dominated the Grizzlies (5-2, 1-2), piling up 594 yards of offense. “It’s good perspective for this program,” Heuberger said, “and what are the important values we want to come out of this with.” Ashland pulled with 24-21 with 6:38 remaining in the third quarter on a 36-yard pass from quarterback Tucker Atteberry to Walker Shibley. Atteberry connected with Michael Pruitt to get the two-point conversion, but from there it was all Springfield. Watson scored on a 16-yard run, capping a 55-second drive, then Ah Sam scored twice on runs of 5 and 7 yards. Atteberry, starting at quarterback for Kyle Weinberg who threw five interceptions last week in a loss to Crater, also threw five picks. He did complete 19-of-39 passes for 204 yards and three touchdowns. \"You just can’t give them five or six more opportunities because of turnovers,\" Ashland coach Charlie Hall said. Watson started the scoring, breaking a 56-yard run with 4:19 left in the first quarter. Watson, who piled up 110 yards rushing in the first half, cruised down the left sideline, picking up blocking as he went. The Grizzlies answered with a 12-play drive that ended with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Atteberry to Sashi Penn. After the Millers tacked on two more scores —one each from Ah Sam and Wilson — Ashland capitalized on a late opportunity to inch within 21-13. The Grizzlies forced a Springfield punt and got enough pressure on Watson on the attempted kick that he pooched it straight up in the air for a net gain of 3 yards. It still took Ashland four plays to score, with Atteberry hitting Mel Elshalom on a scramble drill on fourth down with 10 seconds to go. The PAT attempt failed on a bad snap. The Grizzlies fell into third place in the conference, and with two games left, he said his team still has a lot to fight for. \"This is the playoffs,\" he said. \"It’s a one-game playoff for us. I guess here we are playoffs are here two weeks early.\" By Ben W.
