David Zalubowski AP Photo 1 of 5 Order Reprint of this Story DENVER \nVictor Rask scored 1:49 into overtime, and the struggling Carolina Hurricanes beat the Colorado Avalanche 1-0 on Wednesday night. \nCam Ward stopped 26 shots in his first shutout of the season and 23rd of his career. Ryan Murphy had the lone assist for Carolina, which won for just the second time in six games. \nThe Hurricanes ended a 10-game losing streak in Denver. \nIt was the first 3-on-3 overtime game for both teams. \nColorado's second group in the extra period got caught on the ice, leading to the goal. Murphy fed Rask in the slot, and Rask took the puck to the front of the net and beat Semyon Varlamov with a backhander. It was Rask's second of the season. \nVarlamov finished with 18 saves. \nJarome Iginla almost ended it early in overtime when he went alone into the Carolina zone. Ward made a save on the breakaway. \nVarlamov returned to the net after backup Reto Berra played two games. Varlamov entered Wednesday 1-2 with a 5.06 goals-against average. He was pulled from his last start after allowing five goals on 19 shots against Boston a week ago. \nHe was much sharper against the Hurricanes, especially in the second period. He stopped center Elias Lindholm on a clear shot from the right circle and also made a glove save on Kris Versteeg's breakaway with 36 seconds left in the frame. \nHe also stopped Nathan Gerbe on a breakaway in the first period. \nMatt Duchene nearly won it for Colorado late in regulation, but Ward made a stick save while face down on the ice. \nNOTES: Carolina D John-Michael Liles left the game late in the second period when he took a skate to the face from Iginla. He returned in the third period. ... Avalanche D Tyson Barrie served the second game of his three-game suspension for his hit on Anaheim D Simon Despres on Friday. ... The Hurricanes' last win in Denver was Feb. 16, 1996, when they were the Hartford Whalers.
