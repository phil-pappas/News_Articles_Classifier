Groves has benefitted from the two-year layoff he took from the team, his coach Craig Schurig says. By Rick Peterson Jr. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nAfter a two-year hiatus from the Washburn football program, there was no certainty Hayden Groves would resemble the same player who led the Ichabods in rushing in 2012. \nBut instead of being hampered by the long layoff, Groves actually benefited from his time away from the program, WU coach Craig Schurig said. \n“He’s better, to be honest,” Schurig said. “He’s a couple years more mature. He’s got a real focus. I think the first time through, he had just come from a junior college and he was still kind of taking it for granted a little bit. \n“He had the talent, and he a couple good games for us (in 2012), but now he’s got a little bit more focus to him. You can tell he studies the film and works hard at it. He’s a very talented player.” \nThat much was evident from Saturday’s game at Fort Hays State, in which the senior running back accumulated 267 all-purpose yards, including 87 rushing and 72 receiving. \n“It’s real fun being back and active again,” Groves said. “This is like a new job for me. I feel like I’m taking it more serious, because I took it for granted last time.” \nGroves, an Olathe East product, joined the Ichabods in 2012 after transferring from Coffeyville Community College. He rushed for 824 yards and eight touchdowns as a junior. \nHowever, Groves’ career was interrupted after he was ruled academically ineligible before the 2013 season. \n“If I would have stayed here and taken my classes through the fall and spring, then I would have been eligible for the next season and missed just one year,” Groves said. “But since I went back home and went to a (junior college), I had to graduate from that juco to come back, so I ended up having to sit out two years.” \nStill, Groves was never ready to abandon football without playing his senior season. \n“I always knew I wanted to come back,” Groves said. “I knew I wanted to finish my football career. I didn’t want to go out on a bad note. There was never a doubt in my mind — I was going to get back into football.” \nAfter returning to the Ichabods, Groves didn’t show much rust. Through five games, he’s rushed for 279 yards on 58 carries, averaging 4.8 yards a carry. He’s also added 132 yards receiving. \n“It was about getting the timing back and knowing the plays, but I felt like skill-wise, I still had it,” Groves said. \nGroves (5-foot-9, 185 pounds) offers the Ichabods a nice complement in the running game to Brandon Bourbon, more of a power runner. \n“They make a really good punch,” WU quarterback Derek McGinnis said. “Brandon’s kind of a bigger back, more of a bruiser. Then you have Hayden, who run can run those screens out of the backfield, which I hit him on about four or five times (against Hays). \n“When he gets in space, he’s tough to tackle.” \nGroves and the Ichabods will play host to Central Missouri at 2:37 p.m. Saturday at Yager Stadium for the MIAA Television Game of the Week.
