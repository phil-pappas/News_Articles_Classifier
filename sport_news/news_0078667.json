Cardinals' special teams starting to pay dividends 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nBrian Morgan is afraid that talking about the Lamar special teams will put a jinx on his players. \nAfter a shaky opening game against Bacone, Morgan's special teams have been almost perfect the next three games, so much so it's uncanny to Morgan how well things have gone since the Sept. 5 game. \n\"I think people had a false stance on us after the first game,\" Morgan said. \"But we've really come around and had a good season since.\" \nThe Cardinals dropped four punts and committed multiple penalties on special teams against the Warriors, leading many to believe another mediocre special team's season was coming. \nSince Baylor, all facets of the special teams have exceeded Morgan's criteria. \n\"We have a bunch of unselfish guys who play special teams for us,\" Morgan said. \"They've all really bought in to what we're trying to do.\" \nThe pinnacle of the special teams has come through the kickoff return team, which saw freshman Rodney Randle almost return two kick returns against the Bears then break through with an 87-yard touchdown against Southeastern Louisiana. \nRandle said his return touchdown against the Lions wouldn't have happened at the beginning of the season. \n\"We weren't really taking (special teams) seriously at the beginning of the year,\" Randle said. \"Now, every time our special teams take the field, it's game-changing.\" \nMorgan said the kickoff team is much improved since the start of the season, evidenced by Randle's Southland-leading 27.92 yards per kickoff return. \n\"The blocking I have on kickoff returns now is amazing,\" Randle said. \"We can make plays because everyone is sacrificing for the team now.\" \nThe Cardinals haven't fumbled a punt since Bacone either, which can be attributed to Morgan putting senior receiver Jayce Nelson deep to return punts. \nJunior punter Juan Carranco , who doesn't have to handle placekicking duties like last season, has had a strong season as well. \nCarranco's 38.5 yard average isn't close to tops in the conference but has been effective punting towards the sidelines to avoid returns. \n\"(Having to only punt) has taken a lot of pressure off,\" Carranco said. \"We all know our roles now and have really stepped up.\" \nCarranco had to perform double duty last season since redshirt sophomore kicker Alex Ball missed the season with injury. \nBall is healthy now and has hit all four of his field goal attempts for the Cardinals. \n\"It's big that all of our guys have specific roles this season,\" Morgan said. \"There's a more narrow focus and we can really key in on improving.\" \nThe strong special teams play has impressed Lamar head coach Ray Woodard . \nThe Cardinals' offense ranks third in the conference averaging 43.3 points per game but it's the special teams that has Woodard's approval. \n\"I think it's been the most consistent area of our three so far this season,\" Woodard said. \"We've done a great job.\" \nDShapiro@BeaumontEnterprise.comTwitter.com/DannyShapiro13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:15:38.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
