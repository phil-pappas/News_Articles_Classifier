So digesting what happened with Wake Forest, which is Saturday night’s opponent at Kenan Stadium, was a little uncomfortable for Fedora. “I’m glad I wasn’t part of it,” he said. That was in reference to Wake Forest’s 3-0 victory at Boston College in Saturday’s Atlantic Coast Conference game. There was a positive in that for the Demon Deacons, something even Fedora could identify. “I promise you Wake Forest is awfully happy about that win,” he said. For North Carolina linebacker Jeff Schoettmer, there were endearing qualities about a 3-0 final score. “That shows they have a great defense,” he said of the Demon Deacons. “It’s cool. In a sense, we’d like to match that.” Other Tar Heels noticed, too. “Wake won 3-0,” North Carolina quarterback Marquise Williams said. “A win is a win. It doesn’t matter what the score is.” Wake Forest has scored one touchdown in its past two games, but the Demon Deacons hung within eight points of Florida State in the other game in that span, falling 24-16. Under coach Dave Clawson, Wake Forest has won two ACC games in two seasons. The other was last year’s 6-3 double-overtime outcome against Virginia Tech. Neither of those conference victories has included scoring a touchdown. “We scored three more points than their offense,” Clawson said of the Boston College game. “At the end of the day, that’s all that matters. This is a year where we have to fight and scrap and find ways to get wins and, at times, steal wins.” Fedora said he couldn’t recall ever being involved in winning a game without scoring a touchdown. “I may have blocked that from my memory,” he said.
