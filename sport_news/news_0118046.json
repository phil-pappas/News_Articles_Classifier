Even losing can activate its own rewards when it comes to brain chemistry, said Jeff Henderson, a U of T expert in molecular neuroscience, who took a few minutes off more serious matters to talk sports.\nThe anxiety circuit, driven by perceived threats, is activated by the kind of moments that have fans nervously perched on the edge of their seats. The reward circuit, which results in increased dopamine releases in the brain, is activated by the plays that have fans on their feet cheering and hugging their seat neighbours, whether they know them or not.\n“You have these two competing actions that are working at the same time and the brain is kind of tickled by it because it’s not an imminent threat to your existence,” Henderson said.\n“It’s more like watching a horror movie than actually being involved in a car accident,” he said, referring to the type of anxiety produced by watching sports. “If your sports team wins (a play), you’d see increases of dopamine releases in the brain and you’d feel generally good.”\nThe longer the two systems are activated, the greater the sensitivity of that area of the brain, so when your team finally gets the win — the ultimate reward — it can feel more satisfying, he said.\nBut why does the reward system, which fires up in a rat if a scientist gives it a piece of cheese, activate at all, since spectators aren’t the ones actually succeeding on the field?\nFear and reward systems are old parts of the brain (even ancient crocodiles have them), explained Jonathan Downar, a U of T psychiatrist and expert in neuroimaging. What really makes sport fandom possible are circuits in the frontal lobes that have evolved more recently.\n“They allow you to turn on the basic reward and fear circuits, not just when something good and bad happens to you but when it happens to other people. But they only seem to turn on when they are people you identify with,” he said.\n“What humans have a special capacity for is figuring out in-groups and out-groups, whose on my team and who isn’t,” he added, noting that can be anything from a social group, religion or a sports team.\n“You’ve got these two groups of humans out there, you’ve never met any of them. Some are wearing a shirt that says “Blue Jays” and that’s all you know about them. You’ve never hung out with them, they’ve never looked after your kids or bought you any nice gifts.”\nBut that team uniform makes them “my people” and “all of a sudden, you start enjoying their home runs and not enjoying the home runs of the other people.”\n“Part of the genius of sport is getting everyone to rally around the team, and you start to enjoy their victories as if they’re your personal victories.”\nBut what happens when the team loses, a feeling Toronto fans know all too well?\nThat’s a complicated but interesting answer, according to Henderson.\n“We’re watching our Jays and they go up and down and what if they’re ultimately not successful at the end? The real question is, was it ultimately a depressive experience for the individual?”\nPeople often say it is, but deeper research suggests otherwise, he said.\n“There is a lot of evidence that, no, they really are happier that the saw the games and what they really mean is they would have been even happier if their team had won. But they still received some reward.\nThat reward, which comes with its own releases of dopamine, is part of the brain’s desire for novelty, Henderson explained.\n“Some of us have a very high propensity for novelty-seeking, people who are jumping off cliffs, and some of us less so, but we all have interest in being taken out of our regular lives.\n“So whether your sports team wins or loses, there is this reward.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:18:19.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
