But Carroll said the obvious that “at that time he just made a poor decision.’’ \n—Carroll talked at length about the team just needing to finish but reiterated themes from after the game that it was not any one thing that hurt Seattle Sunday. \n— Carroll said one key was an inability to convert third downs late in the game. He noted on two late third downs that Russell Wilson had trouble getting the ball to Jimmy Graham on one and Doug Baldwin on another. “We have to execute at the end,’’ he said. “We didn’t do that and they did.’’ \n— Carroll said one bright spot was the play of the offensive line, saying the line “played really good football. Did a really good job yesterday.’’ He said of a rushing attack gained a season-high 200 yards that “that’s what it’s supposed to feel like, … I think there are a lot of positives.’’ \nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
