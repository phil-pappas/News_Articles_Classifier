It was just a year ago, and UCLA’s national hype had reached an eerily similar early crescendo. It was four weeks into the season then, too, in a winnable game against Utah, that UCLA’s short ride toward title contention came to an abrupt halt.\nLater in the season, long after UCLA had fallen out of playoff contention, Mora admitted that outside noise had gotten the best of his team. They’d overlooked opponents and heard that noise humming in their ears all along. But now, a year later and with an extra season of on-the-job training, Mora insisted things would be different.\n“There’s a feeling that they’re unsatisfied,” Mora said this week, in the lead-up to a game his Bruins were favored to win by two touchdowns.\nWell, Jim, after watching UCLA fall off the back of the bandwagon again, it’s a feeling to which we can all relate.\nBecause even amid an ugly football slate Saturday that saw its fair share of sour schadenfreude among playoff contenders, seventh-ranked UCLA’s 38-23 loss to Arizona State left the worst taste in our mouths – the kind that won’t likely be washed down soon, even with the bye week ahead. Against a middling Pac-12 team far inferior to their own, the Bruins resoundingly proved, for the second year in a row, that they aren’t ready for the noise and the expectations and the long, bumpy ride to the College Football Playoff.\nIt didn’t take long for things to break down Saturday. From the start, UCLA (4-1, 1-1) was running on fumes, with five of its first six drives ending in a punt – the only outlier being an embarrassingly bad safety from quarterback Josh Rosen. The Bruins offense was so bad to start that it spent most of the game’s opening quarter literally in reverse. With a few minutes remaining in the first, it had minus-2 yards.\nThe running game UCLA had leaned on all season stalled, with running back Paul Perkins taking his first 10 carries for a whopping 11 yards. The offensive line was in shambles, conjuring images of last year’s fall off the bandwagon, when Utah sacked then-quarterback Brett Hundley 10 times.\nWithout any continuity, the offense managed only one drive of more than six plays, and UCLA’s shorthanded defense, down three of its best starters, simply wasn’t – and probably won’t ever be – equipped to keep the Bruins hanging around late without that kind of help.\n“We just made it difficult on ourselves,” Mora said.\nIn the end, there were too many parts missing, too many unanswered issues to keep UCLA’s bandwagon chugging along. Certainly, we’d thought this ride would go on a bit longer, that the Bruins’ talent could at least carry them into their brutal November stretch. But as they got the ball back at their own 1-yard-line, down six points with five minutes remaining and an opportunity to put the pedal to the floor, they sputtered in just 50 seconds.\nOn that fourth down, with their hopes quickly fading, they snapped the ball out of the back of the end zone – a decision Mora said “was really no decision,” but in reality, still seems like a questionable one, nonetheless.\nIt wasn’t the only questionable call from Mora. Just as he explained in his postgame press conference that there were no excuses for Saturday’s loss, he took it upon himself to bizarrely complain about UCLA’s scheduling of back-to-back Thursday games after next week’s bye. “A complete injustice to our young men,” he called it, despite the fact that no one had asked.\nIt was an obvious deflection meant to distract those of us who watched UCLA’s season go off the rails Saturday. It’s a move Mora has used before.\nBut given all that was expected of UCLA, the attention, as with any trainwreck, is inescapable. After an inexcusable defeat, the Bruins’ bandwagon is broken down on the road to the playoff once again, only a few slip-ups away from bursting into flame, a disappointment impossible to ignore.\nContact the writer: rkartje@ocregister.com\nRelated: UCLA Notes: Offense does little in first half UCLA-ASU box score", "external_links": ["http://sports.ocregister.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030064&home=64&vis=58&final=true", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/yards-686015-ucla-career.html"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:17:55.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
