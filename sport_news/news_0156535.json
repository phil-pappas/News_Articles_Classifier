Thank you, boys,\" he said as he pointed to the team. \nIt was during the late innings of the game that Red Sox players decided to salute Orsillo after the final out, according to interim manager Torey Lovullo, who acknowledged how much Orsillo has meant to uniformed personnel and fans over the past 15 years. \n\"We’re happy to do it just to show him a little bit of love and respect for what he’s done for us,\" said utility man Brock Holt. \"He’s just fun man. He doesn’t take his job too seriously but he’s really good at it. He loves what he does and he’s really good at it. Just being around him he’s a good person. We’re going to miss him and everyone that watches him on TV is going to miss his voice calling the games for sure.\" \nNESN will replace Orsillo with Dave O'Brien next season. The announcement was ill-timed and NESN received plenty of negative feedback in the way they handled it. Orsillo has since taken a job with the San Diego Padres for next season. \nOrsillo's final broadcast was filled with \"Classic Moments\" that NESN aired in and out of breaks as well as plenty of reminiscing between Orsillo and longtime partner Remy. There was also a plane that flew over Progressive Field, which read \"Red Sox Nation loves Don Orsillo.\" \nRemy was effusive, and at times emotional, in talking of Orsillo throughout the broadcast. \n\"I value your professionalism in the job and also the fact we're very good friends,\" Remy told him at one point during the telecast. \"I want to thank you for all the fun moments we've had and the friendship. It's a tough day for everybody. It really is. I wish you the best in San Diego, but my friend it's been a lot of fun.\" \nThe moments aired ranged from some of Orsillo's important calls — a handful of no-hitters, David Ortiz homers and Manny Ramirez highlights — to classic Remy-Orsillo schtick. The duo was known to fans throughout New England for their banter and oft-time zaniness. So it was no surprise that some of the highlights included the \"pizza toss,\" the fake mouse that scared Orsillo in the booth and a bit about Orsillo's reversible jacket. \n\"Looks like a smoking jacket,\" he said as the two broke into a string of non-stop laughter. \nOrsillo addressed the TV audience before the last half of the ninth. He referenced the first Red Sox game he ever attended and being able to work with Ken Coleman (as an intern) and with Joe Castiglione. Of course, he also addressed Remy. \n\"I want to thank my friend and partner for 15 years,\" he said. \"We've been through so much on and off the field and we're best friends.\" \nHe left his last remarks for the fans. \n\"Thank you for your incredible support and loyalty,\" he said, calling last Sunday at Fenway the greatest memory of his career. \"I heard all of you and will never forget your words. They touched me.\" Author(s):", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:56:15.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
