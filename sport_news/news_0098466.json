Lovejoy St. about 8:40 a.m. and spotted smoke coming from a second-story window. Inside, they found the alarm system activated and the sprinkler system flowing.\nThe fire was caused by a crafting heat gun left on a hardwood floor in an apartment at the Marshall Wells lofts, the bureau determined. No one was injured in the fire. Firefighters removed water from the sprinklers to prevent property damage.\nDamage estimates were not immediately available.\n\"Be cautious when using high-temperature appliances such as hair dryers, irons, heat guns, space heaters, toasters,\" the bureau warned in a press release. \"It is a good practice to leave appliances unplugged when not in use and store them in a safe place away from combustibles.\"\n-- Michael Russell Follow @tdmrussell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tdmrussell"], "published": "2015-10-12T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:31:13.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
