He broke Nadal's opening service game and fought off two break points on his own serve in the sixth game.\nHe broke Nadal again and took out the first set in 41 minutes, then ran away from his ailing opponent in the second.\nDjokovic has never been beaten at the China Open, winning 29 matches in a row, and six titles in total.\nThe 28-year-old has now 56 career titles, eight of them this year, including the Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open grand slam crowns.\n(Reporting by Julian Linden in Singapore, editing by Julien Pretot)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:56:28.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
