(AP) â€” South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier has told his players that he is retiring, effective immediately. \nThe 70-year-old coach informed players of his decision Monday night, said a person close to the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because South Carolina has not publicly announced Spurrier's decision. \nSouth Carolina has not named an interim coach but likely would announce someone to finish out the season by Wednesday, the person said. \nThe Gamecocks are 2-4 and 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference for the first time in Spurrier's 23 seasons coaching in the league at Florida and South Carolina. \nSpurrier, in the middle of his 11th season at South Carolina, did not return messages from the AP seeking comment. \nThe coach's weekly press conference is still scheduled to be held at noon EST on Tuesday. \nSpurrier considered leaving the Gamecocks last December after the Gamecocks went 6-6. But the team defeated Miami in the Independence Bowl last December, a victory that seemed to re-energize him. \nHe said this summer he planned to coach two or three more years, then extended that to four or five years when several recruits who had committed to South Carolina backed away before signing day in February. \nThen in July, Spurrier held a defiant news conference, telling Gamecocks fans not to listen to \"enemies\" questioning his commitment level, or implying he could no longer effectively coach at his age. \n\"We haven't lost it,\" Spurrier said in the summer. \"We've got a dang, good team.\" \nBut things have quickly spiraled downward this season. \nThe Gamecocks lost to Kentucky at home in the season's second week, then were blown out by SEC Eastern Division rival Georgia, 52-20, a week later. \nLosses at Missouri and No. 6 LSU last week guaranteed Spurrier no better than a break-even season. Spurrier had never had a losing season in 25 previous seasons coaching in college at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) and South Carolina. \nSouth Carolina's inconsistency on offense this season has surely frustrated Spurrier, a former Heisman Trophy winning quarterback at Florida, After beginning his coaching career in the USFL, he returned to the Swamp and led the Gators to a national championship with a high-flying, Fun-n-Gun attack. \nThe Gamecocks are 11th in total offense in the SEC, averaging 341 yards a game. \nThe high-water mark of Spurrier's 11 seasons at South Carolina was from 2011-13. The Gamecocks went 11-2 each season, led by quarterback Connor Shaw and top NFL draft picks like defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, receiver Alshon Jeffery and running back Marcus Lattimore. \nThe Gamecocks have used three starting quarterbacks through the first half of this season, including former walk-on Perry Orth and true freshman in Lorenzo Nunez. \nSouth Carolina plays at home against Vanderbilt (2-3, 0-2) on Saturday. \nSpurrier is the winningest coach ever at South Carolina and Florida. During his tenure at Florida he led the Gators to six SEC titles and a national championship before leaving his alma mater to see what he could do in the NFL. \nAfter two losing seasons with the Washington Redskins he returned to the SEC with South Carolina in 2005 and turned the perennially mediocre Gamecocks into championship contenders. \nSpurrier, who was 35-21 with the USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits from 1983-85, started his college head coaching career at Duke. He has a 228-89-2 career record with the Blue Devils, Gators and Gamecocks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:03:23.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
