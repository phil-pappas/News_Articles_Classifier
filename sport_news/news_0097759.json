(Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com) Comments \nSyracuse, N.Y. â€” Syracuse and Pittsburgh, who meet Saturday afternoon at the Carrier Dome, both rank near the bottom of the country in plays per game. \nFor Syracuse, it's a result not borne of a freshman quarterback-led offense or a desire to run the ball or move away from the fast pace that was coveted by former offensive coordinator George McDonald. \nInstead, it's more tied to the defensive struggles that have permeated in recent weeks. \n\"We need to get off the field on defense,\" Syracuse coach Scott Shafer said Thursday morning during his weekly news conference. Syracuse football coach Scott Shafer's press conference 10/22/15 : Plays per game During his weekly press conference on Thursday October 22, 2015 Syracuse University football head coach Scott Shafer talked about his team's low number of plays per game. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com \"When you look at the drive chart, there's a lot of drives that are 11, 12, 14, we had a 19-play drive ... Our first-down defense has actually been pretty good. Our third-down defense has been the biggest weakness.\"\nOnly Army (59) has averaged fewer plays per game than Syracuse (61.8) this season. \n\"We have a young team that needs to learn to get off the field a little bit better.\" \nHere are two more things Shafer said Thursday. Shafer's midseason synopsis \nOur writers gave you our evaluations of the Orange at the midpoint of the season. \nShafer gave his Tuesday. Syracuse football coach Scott Shafer's press conference 10/22/15 : Mid season evaluation During his weekly press conference on Thursday October 22, 2015 Syracuse University football head coach Scott Shafer gave his mid season evaluation of the team. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com \"Pleased with the progress of the youth, but at the same side of the table, they need to understand they're not young anymore,\" Shafer said.\n\"I think Dungey is playing good football. I think the quarterback production has been good, with the efficiency rating of 167, that's really good, and the thing that is most impressive is he's got a really high efficiency rating, but his yards per completion is huge. That's really high. Those are real throws. It's not like some of these offenses that say he's got a high completion percentage and then you look at it, 20 percent of it is behind the line of scrimmage. \n\"The biggest thing is defensively, we need to get off the field. I've liked the schemes. I like the calls. I just don't think we're finishing as well as we need to, and the kids know that.\" Another Nassib would've been a nice addition \nA few weeks ago, we made note that Penn State defensive end Carl Nassib was leading the nation in sacks . 2015-16 SU Football First-Half Season Report 2015-16 SU Football First-Half Season Report Well, Ryan Nassib's younger brother, who started his career as a walk-on, has not cooled off, most recently recording 3.5 tackles for loss (1.5 sacks) last week at No. 1 Ohio State.\nThrough seven games, Carl Nassib has accrued 11.5 sacks, 15.5 tackles for loss and five forced fumbles. \nThe fifth-year senior leads the nation in all three categories. \nSo, did Syracuse have the younger Nassib on its radar? \"He came to camp, and we were probably just like Penn State,\" Shafer said. \n\"We felt like he was a little ways away from developing. He was kind of a long-body guy, so (still) growing into his body. Our numbers weren't in a position to pass an offer to him, so we tried to get him to walk on, and he chose Penn State. \n\"I'm just happy for him. The Nassib family, they're the best.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:17:23.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
