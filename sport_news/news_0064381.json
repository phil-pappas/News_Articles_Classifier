Here's a breakdown of the game. \nNevada (3-3, 1-1) at Wyoming (0-6, 0-2) \nWhen: 1 p.m., Saturday \nWhere: War Memorial Stadium (capacity, 29,181) \nTV/Radio: None/94.5 FM \nLine: Nevada favored by 6; total is 52.5 \nLast week: Nevada beat New Mexico; Wyoming lost to Air Force Murray's Sunday List: Top-10 WRs in Wolf Pack history \nPosition-by-position \nQuarterback: Close call: Wyoming’s Cameron Coffman, a transfer from Indiana, leads the MW in passing yards (258.2/game) and has thrown for 11 touchdowns. Nevada’s Tyler Stewart is coming off a career-best four-touchdown game and was nearly perfect in the win over New Mexico. Edge: Nevada \nRunning backs: Can’t go wrong either way as Wyoming’s Brian Hill is fifth in the nation with 797 rushing yards and Nevada has the only two teammates who average at least 94 rushing yards per game in the FBS. I’ll go with Nevada’s depth, even though Hill is on the West’s elite backs. Edge: Nevada \nWide receivers/tight end: Wyoming’s top three targets are huge: 6-6 Jake Maulhardt, 6-2 Tanner Gentry and 6-4 Jacob Hollister, who began his career at Nevada. Maulhardt and Gentry have combined for 63 catches for 904 yards and six scores. Pack’s Jerico Richardson leads the MW in catches. Edge: Wyoming The Wolf Pack plays at winless Wyoming on Saturday. Who will win and why? Chris Murray/RGJ \nOffensive line: Nevada’s backup guards, Daren Echeveria and Ziad Damanhoury, played well against New Mexico and get the start again this week. Wyoming’s line, which is young, has allowed 19 sacks, and the team averages just 4.1 yards per rush, dragged down by that sack total. Edge: Nevada \nDefensive line: Wyoming DE Eddie Yarbrough is a two-time All-MW first-team pick, but the Cowboys’ line has struggled. Wyoming has just four sacks (three by Yarbrough) and allows 5.5 yards per rush. Nevada’s line is coming off its best game of the year and should have pass-rush success. Edge: Nevada \nLinebackers: Wyoming’s backers has been ravished by injuries and the team could be without leading tackler, Lucas Wacha (52 tackles), who suffered a concussion last week. Nevada’s Bryan Lane Jr. (ankle) should return after being held out last week; Jordan Dobrich is coming off 12-tackle game. Edge: Nevada \nSecondary: Seven of Wyoming’s top eight defensive backs are freshmen. The other one is a sophomore. It’s a young group led by FS Andrew Wingard (51 tackles, five TFL). Nevada’s group will be tested more this week than the last three, which were all against team that struggle to pass the ball. Edge: Nevada \nSpecial teams: Wyoming K Tristan Bailey is 1-of-5 this season. That’s an issue. Nevada K Brent Zuzo hasn’t missed a kick this year. Both teams are good in the punt game. Wyoming gets the edge in kick returns as D.J. May averages 32.6 yards per return. Zuzo gives Nevada the advantage. Edge: Nevada \nCoaching: Wyoming’s Craig Bohl has struggled with this young team but the guy won three straight FCS national titles and has won 70 percent of his games. He still knows how to coach. Nevada’s Brian Polian has led his team to wins in five of the Wolf Pack’s last seven road games. Not bad at all. Edge: Wyoming \nPrediction \nNevada 31, Wyoming 20: The Wolf Pack coaches and players have made it a point to drill home the message that Wyoming is better than its record (0-6) indicates, which is true, especially on offense, but this is still a winless team that has played a weak schedule. This is a game Nevada must win if it wants to be a championship-caliber team. Wyoming’s played has improved over the last couple of weeks, but the Cowboys have still lost every game this season by at least 10 points and are missing a lot of key players with injuries. Nevada’s ground game should give Wyoming fits and as long as the Wolf Pack pass defense holds up and Nevada plays with the physicality required, Wyoming should take another double-digit loss.
