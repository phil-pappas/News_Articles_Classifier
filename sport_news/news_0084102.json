His production in other areas is great; we have to keep it up. He’s had a good couple weeks of practice since coming back from (a groin) injury he suffered in training camp, and that’s what you have to do ... go and be ready. That’s the hardest part of the NFL, staying ready and working on your craft all the time. And when your number (is) called, being ready to go and respond.\" \nDennard admitted it was hard last season playing almost exclusively on special teams, but he said he took a new mindset into the offseason and heading into this season. \n\"I think this year I'm handling it a little bit better and being more positive,\" said Dennard, who started 38 games in his college career at Michigan State. \"I just think about as Aaron Rodgers/Brett Favre. Aaron sat three years behind a Hall of Fame player. I just have to be positive and stay ready like A-Rodg did and you see what kind of player he turned out to be, and that's just what I've got to do.\" \nDennard finished second on the team in special teams tackles last season and is tied for first this season. \nHe did get 22 defensive snaps in the season-opening blowout win at Oakland, but got just one the next game against San Diego and none in this past Sunday's win at Baltimore. That doesn't mean Lewis doesn't have confidence in Dennard. \n\"He’ll play just as well as what we’re playing and I feel good about that,\" said Lewis. \"He's smart, and he's trained to play a bunch of different spots there, which is good.\" \nThat means if Iloka doesn't play and Hall moves from being the nickel corner covering the slot receiver to safety on passing downs then Dennard could see action either covering the slot receiver or moving outside with Jones moving to cover the slot receiver. \nWhatever situation he's placed, Dennard said he'll be ready to play. \n\"You have to take pride in what you do and you can't not be ready and get thrown into the game and mess up and look bad,\" said Dennard. \"You have to stay ready. Football is a dangerous sport. You never know when somebody goes down - it's a long season. I just have to prepare like I'm a starter and that's what I've been doing.\" \nPhoto: Tony Tribble \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
