Gould told The Dominion Post ( http://bit.ly/1Pr1ZIX ) the two met on the field where she was playing and he was an umpire. \nThe ballpark theme was complete with the wedding party attired in softball uniforms reflecting the colors of the couple's conflicting allegiances: Gould is a native New Yorker and a Yankees fan, while Casteel roots for their rival, the Boston Red Sox. \nBut Gould said, \"Love is blind.\" \nOnce the ceremony was over, the couple walked through a tunnel of Louisville Sluggers held aloft by their friends and family. \nInformation from: The Dominion Post, http://www.dominionpost.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:42:36.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
