That's what you want. You want that click amongst the teams and we didn't have it today.\" \n\nPrice conceded that his young team had been overawed on the first day. \n\n\"I think the youngsters, the rookies today, played a little apprehensively, which often happens when you play with a partner,\" said Price. \n\n\"We had a good chat in the team room and I think the guys have got the idea now. The first day blues or shock is over.\" \n\nPrice was clearly pleased to have former Masters champion Schwartzel back in the reckoning. \n\n\"Charl is doing really well,\" said Price. \"He had a day off yesterday and spent the majority of it in bed. He hit some balls this morning and chipped and putted... (he) said he's ready to go.\" \n\nHaas tried to play down the significance of putting the world number one out first, a move seemingly designed to give the US an early scoreboard boost. \n\n\"It was kind of a gut feeling, I guess. I know we've gone with Bubba and J.B. today, and Bubba has gone out first a lot, and he likes that spot. But he said it does not matter to him.\" \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:00:17.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
