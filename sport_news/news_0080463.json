Jerry Brown:\n- HEALTH CARE: A new law extends state-subsidized health care coverage to children from low-income families who are in the country illegally. The measure is expected to help 170,000 children.\n- UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN: This measure lets state courts appoint guardians up to age 21 for immigrants applying to a federal government program for children abused or abandoned by their parents. The law is expected to enable more immigrant children who arrived on the border alone apply for legal status.\n- OPPOSES DISCRIMINATION: A measure bans discrimination by businesses against people based on their immigration status, citizenship or languages spoken.\n- CRIMINAL CASES: This measure requires defense lawyers to warn immigrants facing criminal charges of the immigration consequences of their case and prosecutors to consider these consequences as a factor in plea negotiations.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
