Unless you’re a NV/Old Tappan fan, the No. 1 Golden Knights’ 42-14 victory over No. 2 Pascack Valley lost all of its juice way before halftime.\nThat’s probably not going to happen Saturday afternoon in Oradell, when the story takes a non-public twist. St. Joseph, No. 2 in The Record non-public Top 6, faces No. 1 Bergen Catholic in a game that always seems to find a way to entertain.\nRemember, before Don Bosco was the Don Bosco we know today, Bergen Catholic and St. Joseph were the top dogs in North Jersey non-public football. They owned the spotlight, and Green Knights’ old-timers will tell you this will always be their big rivalry game.\nSt. Joseph coach Augie Hoffmann, who has played and coached in these games for the Green Knights, said this is going to be an emotional week. The current crop of Green Knights still haven’t forgotten the sting of last season’s stunning double-overtime loss to BC at Dinallo Stadium.\nThere’s history there, to be sure, but there’s also enough drama in the here and now to keep the intensity level at full throttle.\nFor openers, first place in the Big North United Division is on the line. That’s just about as juicy a carrot as you can dangle in front of a North Jersey football player in October.\nBoth teams are 2-0 with two games to play, and an unbeaten season in New Jersey’s glamour division would provide a banner for the gym that will be admired for years to come.\nThere also will be a truckload of Non-Public Group 4 power points on the line as teams begin some serious jockeying for playoff position in a most unforgiving bracket. Eleven points separate the No. 2 Green Knights and No. 4 Crusaders, and a win will go a long way toward securing at least one home game in the playoffs.\nForget all the talk about mythical national championships. Those out-of-state games against powerhouse programs might be interesting, but games like this are the real meat of the Big Five’s schedule.\nAnd when you factor in the notion that Saturday’s game could be a preview of the Non-Public Group 4 championship game in December, we’ve got some great big-time high school football theater right in our own back yard.\nEmail: czerwinski@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:44.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
