Nepali police arrested five former and current national team players, including the captain, yesterday on charges of match fixing, in another blow to the country's embattled football association. \nCaptain Sagar Thapa, Sandip Rai, Ritesh Thapa, Bikash Singh Chhetri and Anjan KC were arrested on charges of alleged match-fixing from 2008, SSP Sarbendra Khanal of the Metropolitan Police Crime Division said. \n\"From preliminary examinations of the players' accounts, we found connections to known match-fixers in Malaysia and Singapore,\" said Khanal. \n\"It seems that these players were involved in a deep network of brokers and fixers in other countries.\" \nKhanal said investigations were still at a preliminary stage and added he was not in a position to disclose whether officials from the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), the country's governing body would also be implicated. \nANFA officials could not be immediately reached for comment. \nThe match-fixing charges emerge with football in the country in turmoil since world governing body FIFA last year launched an investigation into financial irregularities during president Ganesh Thapa's reign at ANFA. \nLong-serving president and former national captain Thapa is fighting a court battle against four vice-presidents he fired from the organisation earlier this year. \nLast year, officials from ANFA asked FIFA to investigate the Nepali governing body. \nThapa, a former Asian Football Confederation vice-president, voluntarily stepped down and refrained from all football activities for 120 days late last year while FIFA probed accusations of misconduct from his colleagues at ANFA. \nThe FIFA Ethics Committee is yet to make a judgment on the case. – Reuters, October 15, 2015. \nShare with others", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:21:45.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
