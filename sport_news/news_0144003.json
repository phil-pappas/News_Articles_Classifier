DON WORTHINGTON dworthington@heraldonline.com i Order Reprint of this Story FORT MILL \n#myYCstory – that’s the hashtag the Rock Hill/York County Convention and Visitors Bureau wants people to use when talking about their York County tourism experience on social media. \nThe hashtag is part of the bureau’s new branding and marketing strategy unveiled Thursday at Harmony Hall at the Carowinds amusement park. \nThe hashtag supports a marketing campaign that encourages visitors and residents alike to “create their story” while in the county. The simple tag line came after the convention and visitors bureau considered all the things there are to do locally. \nThey kept coming back to attractions such as the Anne Springs Close Greenway in Fort Mill, the Catawba River and the outdoors. \n“History also ranked high” said Lisa Meadows, executive director of the convention and visitors bureau. \n“That’s where ‘create your story’ came from,” she said. \nThe create-your-story tag line also can be combined with the county’s other assets, such as sporting events to “Create your story, create your game,” Meadows said. \nThe new campaign replaces the tag line “You’re Welcome” which has been in place for about nine years. \n“That could be anywhere, anytime,” Meadows said. \nAlong with the new tagline the convention and visitors bureau unveiled a new logo, a stylized combination of the letters y and c for York County. \nThe letters flow into each other and there are two large circles. \nThe combination of the letters represents partnerships, family, community and togetherness, according to the convention and visitors bureau. \nThe colors of the logo also have meaning. Blue is for the waterways of York County, green for the greenways and yellow for “the sun that shines bright on it all.” \nMeadows said a number of logos were considered but the one selected had the “it” factor, it was cutting edge and had an open feel. It also showed “open arms and we are open to growth,” Meadows said. \nFor the campaign to succeed, Meadows said it will take the backing of the convention and visitors bureau’s partners. “They will need to use the logo, help people create stories and create their own stories,” she said. \nAll of the convention and visitors bureau’s marketing tools – from printed handouts to the web site and mobile app have been rebranded. \nThe convention and visitors bureau also released its annual tourism report, noting that the return on investment is $23 for every $1 given to the bureau. There were 1.3 million visitors to area, generating $20.7 million in tourism revenue in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:41:32.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
