(AP) - The man who police say was fatally shot when he broke into a woman's house early Sunday morning has been identified.\nLauderdale County Coroner Clayton Cobler tells The Meridian Star ( http://bit.ly/1OKj2FY ) fingerprints positively identified the man as James Cole Jr.\nCobler says Cole was shot three times in the chest with a .380 caliber revolver.\nDetective Dareall Thompson says the woman was upstairs in her two-story home when she looked downstairs and saw the man in her living room. He says the woman came down the stairs and shot the intruder.\nThompson says Cole made it out of the front door and collapsed.\nHe says the homeowner will face a grand jury but it will likely be determined she acted within her legal rights.\nInformation from: The Meridian Star, http://www.meridianstar.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
