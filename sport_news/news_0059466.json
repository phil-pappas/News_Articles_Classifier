In an effort to remain in the series, Beltre had a cortisone shot. \n“Obviously we want Adrian in there,” Banister said. “He’s the heart and soul of this ballclub.” \nAfter going for tests at a hospital, Beltre returned to the clubhouse about an hour after the game and walked gingerly. An MRI confirmed Beltre had a strained back but no structural damage, general manager Jon Daniels said. \n“We haven’t ruled him out of tomorrow’s game,” Daniels said. \nTexas will have Joey Gallo and Ed Lucas travel from its Arizona Fall League team in case Beltre needs to be removed from the roster, a decision that also would rule Beltre out of the AL Championship Series. \nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons said Donaldson felt light-headed while playing defense in the top of the fifth, forcing the AL MVP candidate to come out of the game. \n“They check for concussions, and apparently he passed all the tests. So that’s good news,” Gibbons said. \nYovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings. \n“That’s what we really needed from him,” Banister said. “I think he did a great job.” \nGallardo is 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against Toronto. \n“We got in some good hitter’s counts and he wouldn’t give in,” Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin said. “He didn’t make those mistakes that we capitalize on.” \nKeone Kela, Jake Diekman and Sam Dyson finished, with Dyson getting a save. \nPitching on 11 days’ rest, Price (0-1) allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He dropped to 1-6 with a 4.79 ERA in 11 postseason games, and is 0-6 in six playoff starts. \n“I expect to have better results,” a subdued Price said. \nGibbons said Price was the victim of timely hits by the Rangers. \n“He wasn’t getting hit around. It was just a couple of key hits at some key times that made the difference,” Gibbons said.
