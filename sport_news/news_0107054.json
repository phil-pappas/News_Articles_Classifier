Lee Janzen (68) and first-round leader Bernhard Langer (73) were at 138. Tom Lehman (71) and John Riegger (72) were another stroke back. \n\"It really rained on us out there,\" said Perry, who won this tournament in 2011. \"It was a battle.\" \nPerry is looking for his ninth win on the tour. He won the 3M Championship in August and the Charles Schwab Cup in 2013. \nJeff Maggert made the biggest move Saturday. The Charles Schwab Cup co-leader shot a 67 and was four shots back at 140. Maggert was tied with Kevin Sutherland (72) and Scott Dunlap (73). \nDurant has six professional wins for his career, having played on the PGA, Champions and Web.com tours the past few years. Janzen is an eight-time winner on the PGA Tour. He won the ACE Group Classic in a playoff in February in the 50-and-over event. \nColin Montgomerie, tied with Maggert in the season-long points race, shot a 72 and was at 142. Langer is third in the Schwab Cup race. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:55:15.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
