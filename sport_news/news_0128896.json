When Mangham travels to Ouachita Christian for Friday’s game, they will meet as the final two teams with 2-0 records in district play. The winner is just two wins away from taking the district outright. \n“We know it. Right now, we’re 2-0 and they’re 2-0 in district. Whoever wins this game is in the driver’s seat for the district championship,” Ouachita Christian coach Steven Fitzhugh said. “It’s area bragging rights, that’s the thing.” \nFriday culminates a brutal stretch in the schedule for the Eagles, having just won at Sterlington 21-18 then beating Rayville 42-28 at home last week. Those two games came after a 35-28 loss at Alexandria. \nMangham has had its fair share of excitement of late, as well, beating Sterlington 36-35 in overtime last week on a successful two-point conversion. \n“I guess everybody’s brain can go several different ways after that,” Mangham coach Tommy Tharp said. “You prepare the same way week-in and week-out. You hope you can rebound from an emotional win or emotional loss. Our kids out here and our team’s personality have always been even-keeled. I feel good about where our mind is right now.” \nTharp also feels good about where his offense is right now, scoring over 35 points in each of its last five games. \n“Our offensive line has really come along,” Tharp said. “We started out, quite frankly, not very good, trying to fill some positions, but we think we’ve filled those positions and maybe developed some depth, too. That’s been a pleasant surprise. Probably what’s been more of a surprise is that we’ve been able to keep depth at running back, keep kids healthy and develop some younger guys.” \nFitzhugh added of the Mangham offense, “We’ve seen it through the years with them. They run a scheme they learn early and they keep getting better at it from the time they’re in junior high and JV and when they’re on varsity, they have guys that can step in.” \nTharp knows the Ouachita Christian offense presents its own challenges, too. \n“They are awful talented, and they’re awful multiple,” Tharp said. “They’re probably one of the more balanced teams we play year-in and year-out. You have to be equally sound in playing the run and the pass. \n“It’s never an easy chore stopping them. We’ve never completely shut them down.” \nFollow Brett on Twitter, @BHudsonTNS. 18 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1RX7hKJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:02:46.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
