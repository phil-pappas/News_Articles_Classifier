It was the first time since Nov. 4, 1951 in which the Giants scored on both an interception return and kickoff return in the same game.\nThe last time it happened? Tom Landry got the interception return and Emlen Tunnell had the kickoff return. Both are Pro Football Hall of Famers.\nHarris’ 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown matched the Giants’ franchise record set by Tunnell in 1951 and matched in 1964 by Clarence Childs.\nDE Robert Ayers returned after missing four games with a strained hamstring. He had two quarterback hits and nearly had an interception of Cowboys QB Matt Cassel.\n“Oh, man, I hate not being able to help my guys win, I hate not being able to be with them out there when they’re going through things,’’ Ayers said. “It meant a lot for me to be out there.’’\nJosh Brown’s 47-yard field goal in the second quarter was his 18th consecutive made field goal, a Giants franchise record. Brown made a 34-yarder in the third quarter for his 19th straight. … Tom Coughlin gained his 100th regular-season victory with the Giants. Eli Manning’s 95th regular-season win tied Phil Simms’ franchise record. … After missing two games with a strained hamstring, LB Devon Kennard had seven tackles in his first game back. … DE Owa Odighizuwa left in the third quarter with a hamstring injury. … LB Uani ’Unga (neck) was inactive. … Cowboys RB Joseph Randle left the field with a strained back after the first offensive series (and only two rushing attempts) and did not return.\nDuring the week, Coughlin admitted he did not know if he could trust DE Damontre Moore, as far as Moore avoiding costly penalties and flat-out dumb plays after last week’s terrible roughing the passer penalty against the Eagles. Coughlin proved that point, as Moore was inactive for the first time this season. Punishment? You bet.\n“That’s between me and him,’’ Coughlin said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:57:03.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
