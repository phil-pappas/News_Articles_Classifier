He says “we want to overestimate rather than underestimate the costs.” \nHamburg residents will decide in a referendum Nov. 29 whether the port city’s Olympic bid proceeds. \nLos Angeles, Paris, Rome and Budapest are the other candidates. The first bid files must be submitted by Feb. 17, 2016 and the International Olympic Committee will choose the host city in 2017.
