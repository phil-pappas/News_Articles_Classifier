With one more win (or two ties), they’ll qualify for States for the third time in this 27-year span. \nThe 1996 club went 9-5-3, the most wins in the last 27 years. \nRookie coach Christopher Drew’s squad can equal (or beat) that modern wins record with regular season games left against Methuen, Lowell, Tewksbury and Georgetown then the possible state tourney berth. \nThe Hillies beat Methuen 2-1, Lowell 2-0 and Georgetown 3-1 earlier in the season. \nThe lone state tourney win in this 27-year span was a preliminary round game in 1995 to that’s another piece of history out there. \nThe Hillies have gone 5-5 in the Merrimack Valley Conference and 3-0 in non-league play. They’ve had their struggles against some of the heavyweights of the MVC Large but are tied for first in the MVC Small. \nWith another two wins this fall, the Hillies would equal their win total from the previous four years combined (10-48-7). \nThe Hillie captains are seniors Gaby Ginn, Liz Brady, Lizzy Duchemin and Sydney Demarais. \nBrady has a team-high eight goals followed by Demarais and junior Cynthia Caruso with four apiece, Ginn with three, Duchemin and senior Juanita Pardo with two each and sophomore Jordyn O’Boyle with one. \nSenior Alex Comeau, a Southern New Hampshire University lacrosse goalie recruit, has been a standout in net. \nHAVERHILL THROUGH THE YEARS \n2015: 8-5 (4 regular season games left) \n2014: 3-12-3, didn’t make tourney \n2013: 2-13-3, didn’t make tourney \n2012: 3-11-1, didn’t make tourney \n2011: 2-12, didn’t make tourney \n2010: 4-10-2, didn’t make tourney \n2000-2009 seasons \n2009: 8-10, didn’t make tourney \n2008: 2-14-2, didn’t make tourney \n2007: 2-14, didn’t make tourney \n2006: 3-11-2, didn’t make tourney \n2005: 3-15, didn’t make tourney \n2004: 3-12-3, didn’t make tourney \n2003: 2-14-2, didn’t make tourney \n2002: 3-10-3, didn’t make tourney \n2001: 2-16, didn’t make tourney \n2000: 3-13-1, didn’t make tourney \n1989-1999 \n1999: 5-13, didn’t make tourney \n1998: 2-14, didn’t make tourney \n1997: 3-12-1, didn’t make tourney \n1996: 9-5-3, lost in D1 North first round \n1995: 8-6-4, lost in D1 North first round (won a prelim round game) \n1994: didn’t make tourney \n1993: didn’t make tourney \n1992: didn’t make tourney \n1991: didn’t make tourney \n1990: didn’t make tourney \n1989: Didn’t make tourney Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:07:33.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
