Photograph: Epsilon/Getty Images \nA nthony Martial went from villain to hero as his second-half equaliser earned Manchester United a deserved point in a 1-1 draw against CSKA Moscow in Champions League Group B on Wednesday. \nThe French teenager conceded a first-half penalty but popped up with a fine header to keep United two points behind group leaders VfL Wolfsburg, level with CSKA and a point ahead of PSV Eindhoven. \nThe visitors started well but fell behind after 15 minutes after Martial was correctly adjudged to have hand-balled in the penalty area. \nRoman Eremnko’s spot-kick was brilliantly palmed on to the post by David de Gea, but the ball rebounded into the path of Seydou Doumbia who had the easiest of finishes. \nAhmed Musa almost doubled the lead midway through the first half side as he looked to chip the Spanish international from distance, but De Gea produced another top-class save to keep his team in the game. \nUnited had to wait until just before the hour mark to force Igor Akinfeev in the CSKA goal to make a save as he kept out a Wayne Rooney header. \nBut the momentum was with the visitors and they drew level on 65 minutes. \nAntonio Valencia produced a good cross from the right which was met by Martial who sent a glancing header past Akinfeev and in off the post. \nUnited, with Marouane Fellaini on as a focal point for the attack, swarmed forward in search of the winner but failed to create any clearcut chances and were forced to settle for a point. \nCity grab second Group D win but leave it late again Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne scores their second goal against Sevilla at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Wednesday. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters \nM anchesterCity left it late to win a second successive Champions League game, with Kevin De Bruyne scoring a minute into stoppage time to give them a 2-1 win over Sevilla at the Etihad Stadium in Group D on Wednesday. \nLast month Sergio Aguero's penalty in the 90th minute gave them a 2-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach and the two wins, following a home defeat by Juventus in their opening game, have boosted their chances of reaching the last 16. \nDe Bruyne's goal came even later than Aguero's with the Belgian's neatly-executed left-foot angled shot coming after 91 minutes to give City victory when it looked as though Sevilla were about to leave with a deserved point. \nDe Bruyne has had a huge impact since arriving for 55 million pounds ($84.78 million) from VfL Wolfsburg at the end of August and he played a defining role in this game too, after coach Manuel Pellegrini pushed him up front in search of the winner. \nThe result, plus Juventus's 0-0 draw with Moenchengladbach in the other game, left Juve top with seven points, followed by City on six, Sevilla (3) and Moenchengladbach (1). \nReal hold PSG to take control of group IMAGE: Paris Saint Germain's Edinson Cavani (left) challenges Real Madrid's Danilo during their Champions League Group A match at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, on Tuesday. Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters \nR eal Madrid took a big step towards finishing top of Champions League Group A game when they held Paris St Germain to a 0-0 draw in the French capital on Wednesday as both teams remained unbeaten. \nFrench champions PSG enjoyed most of the possession but took an over-cautious approach and injury-hit Real had the best chances through Cristiano Ronaldo and Jese in the first half. \nThe Spanish 10-times European champions stayed top of the group with seven points from three games and lead PSG on goal difference, with the reverse fixture to come in Madrid in two weeks time. \nMalmo are third on three points after beating pointless Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0. \nJuventus frustrated by Gladbach as Buffon breaks record \nJ uventus were held to a frustrating 0-0 home draw with Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Champions League on Wednesday, as the Italians dominated possession and chances but failed to break down the visitors' steely defence. \nThe hosts hogged the ball but were unable to find a breakthrough with Paul Pogba and Alvaro Morata both going close, while Mario Mandzukic had a penalty appeal rejected by referee Craig Thomson on 66 minutes. \nWhile Juventus failed to make a mark on the scoresheet, keeper Gianluigi Buffon entered the club's record books as he beat Alessandro Del Piero’s record for minutes played for the 'Old Lady' of Italian football. \nDel Piero previously held the record having played 48,867 minutes for the club, but it was surpassed by Buffon in the 73rd minute of an exasperating evening for Juventus. \n“I overtook Del Piero, but I prefer the success of the team, to share it with friends, the public and the fans,\" a disappointed Buffon told reporters. \nThe draw left Juve in top spot in Group D, havingpicked up seven points from their opening three matches. \nMartinez on target as Atletico hit four past Astana Atletico Madrid's Jackson Martinez (left) celebrates next to teammate Saul Niguez after scoring a goal against Astana during their Champions League Group C match at Vicente Calderon stadium in Madrid on Wednesday.
