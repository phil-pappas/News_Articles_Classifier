It was a half-joke at best. The Spartans could sure use Vickers' size, not to mention another familiar face.\nIn large part because of the surprise loss of 6-9 star forward RaShid Gaston to Xavier in May, Jones is left with a dearth of big men that will force him to completely change his team's playing style.\nThe Spartans went 20-14 overall and 12-4 in the MEAC last season behind Gaston and his 15.5 points and a team-high 9.6 rebounds a game. This season, they will use a four-guard system and rely on 6-6 sophomore forward Jordan Butler and a stable of newcomers for production in the post.\nHow drastic is the difference between the new approach and what Jones prefers?\n\"That changes pretty much everything,\" Jones said. \"That's not the way that I normally coach. I like to have some bigs in there. But just like with anything, you've got to adjust to what you have.\"\nOf the 14 players on NSU's roster, nine are new to the program. Two will sit out the season after transferring, meaning that more than half of those available to Jones have never played a minute for the Spartans.\nAmong them, only 6-8 forward Alex Long and 6-10 forward/center Moses Toriola - both true freshmen - are taller than Butler.\nJones, whose office shelf is stocked with books on basketball strategy from which he regularly draws ideas, took an inquisitive approach to reinventing his team. He reached out for advice from Iona coach Tim Cluess, a four-guard proponent for whom Jones worked at a New York high school early in his career.\nThrough an agent friend, he contacted the staff of the Golden State Warriors, who have succeeded with four guards. The Warriors shared a number of offensive plays that Jones believes will be a fit for returning guards Jeff Short - fittingly, one of three captains of this diminutive team - and D'Shon Taylor.\n\"Obviously, we don't have Steph Curry,\" Jones said, \"but I think we have somebody similar for our level in Jeff Short. (Taylor) would be our Klay Thompson.\"\nJust a few practices in, roles have yet to be defined for most of the other players. The Spartans spent the first week of workouts getting to know each other. Even two assistant coaches are new.\nWhen the season opens Nov. 14 at South Carolina, NSU fans will be well advised to buy a program.\n\"It's a little strange, but we're getting used to it,\" Butler said, referring to the introductory phase. \"We're all coming together as a team. I like the all the new guys, personally, but I know I'm missing my guy RaShid. But that's all right.\"\nHe's not alone. Gaston told Jones he chose to leave to increase his chances of playing in the NBA, as well as to be close to his native Warren, Ohio.\nBut his departure came too late in the recruiting season for Jones to have a realistic shot at landing a replacement. Without Gaston, the expectations for NSU's season likely dropped for many. Jones is using the notion to motivate his players.\n\"Hopefully, they'll play with a chip on their shoulder,\" he said. People outside the program \"think that one player's going to make or break us. Hopefully, they'll buy in to that a little bit.\"\nZaynah Robinson, a 5-11 guard who averaged 2.6 points per game as a true freshman last season, said he's not concerned with the team's lack of height - or its lack of Gaston.\n\"It's not about how big you are; it's about how big you play,\" Robinson said. \"If you play big on the court, you're going to win big. It's simple as that.\n\"Of course, it's always good to prove people wrong, but (losing Gaston) shouldn't be the basis of our season or the theme of our season. We should just want to win just because we want to win.\"\nBut size couldn't hurt, and Jones plans to make it the top priority for next year's recruiting class.\nFor now, though, he'll work with what he's got, which could include a rotation of as many as 11 players as the Spartans try to wear opponents down with their quickness.\n\"It definitely is different,\" Jones said. \"But a good different, because I think that everybody is kind of (getting) a fresh start. There's no real carryover from last year.\n\"Almost everybody in here is going to have to play, probably, at one point or another.\"\nAs much as Jones hates it, he meant almost everybody but Vickers.\nDavid Hall, 757-446-2367, david.hall@pilotonline.com\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
