The South African leader, who was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, was beacon of democratic struggle against apartheid in his country. The ennobling epithet from Modi for Badal, considered to be one of the pillars of the ruling NDA at the Centre, could not have come at a better time. His Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is understood to be in a bitter-sour relationship with the BJP in the state. Speaking at “Loktantra Prahari Abhinandan”, a programme organised to commemorate the 113th birth anniversary of socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan, Modi said: “Badal sahab is sitting here…He is the Nelson Mandela of India. The only crime of people like him was that they had political views different from those in power.” “It’s unfortunate that very few people know that in free India, Badal had been jailed for around two decades solely for political reasons,” Modi said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:07:21.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
