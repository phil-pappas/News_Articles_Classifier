(AP) - Bond is now $100,000 each for a man and woman held for more than a year without bond on charges of attempted murder, home invasion and burglary\nThe Vicksburg Post ( http://bit.ly/1H33vcr ) reports that Circuit Judge Isadore Patrick set bail for 34-year-old Bryan Jason Morton, of Port Gibson and 24-year-old Kimberly Nicole Chatman, of Vicksburg.\nWarren County Judge Johnny Price had previously denied bail for both.\nThey're accused of beating a 70-year-old woman and leaving her for dead in May 2014. The case is scheduled for trial Nov. 9.\nMorton's attorney, Eugene Perrier, says his request for bond was based partly on DNA evidence that took months to become available. Patrick ruled the reduction extended to Chatman, though neither she nor her attorney sought a reduction in bail.\nInformation from: The Vicksburg Post, http://www.vicksburgpost.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
