The investigation into Wednesday's incident, including full toxicology test results, was expected to take at least a month.\nColeman was booked into King County Jail early Thursday and initially denied bail. Bellevue police officers said they arrested him because he left the scene of the two-car accident Wednesday evening.\nSteve Hayne, one of Coleman's lawyers, has said Coleman was \"in shock\" and didn't flee or go far from the scene.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
