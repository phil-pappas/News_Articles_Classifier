By doing so, it will open up one-on-one matchups in the passing game that Brissett can take advantage of. \nDespite the Demon Deacons offensive struggles, sophomore quarterback John Wolford was one of the few bright spots in an otherwise disappointing loss to the Tar Heels, completing 16-of-22 passes for 176 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. \nCopyright 2015 by Technician.
