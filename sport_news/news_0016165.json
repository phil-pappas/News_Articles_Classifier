The Mount St. Joseph University freshman died from brain cancer in April. \nXavier and Mount St. Joseph say the bobbleheads depict her scoring against Hiram College last Nov. 2. \nHill used her last months to raise money for cancer research and to remind people that life is precious. \nHiram will visit again as part of a doubleheader, with proceeds going to cancer research. Xavier's women's team plays Evansville. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
