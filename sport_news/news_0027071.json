He arced one pass high into the air, hitting a receiver in stride. He zipped the ball to another. The scouts scribbled on their paper. The sun began to set.\nThis is the new normal for the Tigers' lanky and mustachioed junior quarterback, a lightly-recruited prospect from Deltona, Florida, who is now receiving serious attention as a potential NFL draft pick. Lynch recently appeared at No. 17 on a list of first-round draft prospects compiled by ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr., the network's pre-eminent draft expert. Scouts have been on hand to see him in each of his past three games. Saturday morning's nationally-televised game against No. 13 Ole Miss will likely be no different.\n\"I try not to think about it at all,\" Lynch said after Memphis' 24-17 win over South Florida on Oct. 2. \"I remember when I was playing and there were no scouts here. So that's how I kind of take it now. I don't even pay attention to them.\"\nLynch said he has not spent much time worrying about what will happen after this season, when he will choose to declare for the NFL draft or return for his final season of eligibility at Memphis. His parents, David and Stacie Lynch, said the draft speculation and heightened attention haven't clouded their focus as a family.\n\"I think it is what it is. We've gone through the negative, now we go through the positive,\" Stacie Lynch said. \"It's about winning games and bringing home another championship for Memphis, and that's really what we're focused on and what he's focused on. Everything else will fall into place as it's supposed to.\"\nLynch has been one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the Football Bowl Subdivision through five games. He has completed 70.5 percent of his passes, which ranks fifth in the country, and sports a passing efficiency rating of 181.5, which ranks third. He has not thrown an interception in 159 attempts dating to the fourth quarter of last year's Miami Beach Bowl.\nSaturday's game against Ole Miss is an important opportunity for Memphis, which has won 12 consecutive games, to cement its status as one of the best Group of Five teams in the country. But it is also an individual measuring stick for Lynch in the eyes of NFL talent evaluators, who want to see how the 6-foot-7 quarterback fares against steeper competition.\n\"You're going to play against better competition when you go to the next level. It's this kind of game every week,\" said ESPN analyst Andre Ware, a member of the broadcast team for Saturday's game. \"The thing you have to fight, as a player, is you just have to stay within yourself and do what you've done all along against any competition you've faced.\"\nWare first saw Lynch play as a redshirt freshman against Cincinnati in 2013, describing him as \"a young, unpolished jewel.\" \"He looks like a totally different player (now),\" the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback said. Today, Ware sees a player who has learned to control his athletic ability, someone with a strong arm, great feet and mobility that belies his size\n\"(Lynch has) all the things that it takes to be a big-time quarterback on the next level,\" Ware said. \"I think he's going to open some eyes on the next level, and I don't think teams should be afraid, whatsoever, to take a look at him.\n\"This Saturday will be, in my opinion, his coming-out party, so to speak. It'll give the nation a chance to see exactly who he is. I know they've played on national TV, but this is some big-time exposure against a really, really quality football team in Ole Miss.\"\nLast year against the Rebels, Lynch had one of the worst performances of his college career, completing 13 of 31 passes for 81 yards and one interception. This season, he has thrown for 1,535 yards and 10 touchdowns. He's been featured in a story by Sports Illustrated and mentioned on national-television broadcasts as a fringe Heisman Trophy candidate.\nBefore the season, coach Justin Fuente spoke with Lynch about handling this sort of attention.\n\"He's handled the hard things, in terms of not playing as well as he'd like, but handling the successes is just as hard as handling the struggling,\" Fuente said last week. \"He's done a good job. He's focused on trying to help the team. There hasn't been a day at practice where I felt like he was taking it easy.\"\nDavid Lynch said his youngest son has always been even-keeled. He has appeared calm and poised on the field against Cincinnati and Bowling Green, leading the Tigers to a pair of close wins. And his personality away from football is not much different.\n\"He's really humble,\" said tight end Daniel Montiel, one of Lynch's three roommates. \"If he sees (himself) on TV, we're kind of just like ... yeah. I mean, it's there, but nothing's complete. We still have a whole seven games ahead of us, and if we're lucky to play more, we'll play more. He's handled it really well.\"\nAfter Memphis' win over South Florida, Lynch lingered in the concrete tunnel outside the locker room to answer a few extra questions from a reporter. In two weeks, he knew he would be getting ready to face Ole Miss. Scouts would once again be roaming the sidelines. Television commentators would be talking about his NFL draft stock. The spotlight would be fixed squarely on him, and he would do his best to block it out.\n\"I'm just focused on what I can do for this team this year, and what we can accomplish as a team,\" Lynch said. \"Right now, I'm just worried about what we can do.\"\n Memphis vs. (13) Ole Miss\nWhen, where: 11 a.m. Saturday, Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium\nTV, radio: WATN Channel 24, WHBQ-AM 560, WREC-AM 600", "external_links": ["http://app.contenttools.co/polls/2017/embed.js?show_name=yes&show_description=yes&show_sharing_options=yes&show_cover_image=yes"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:22:53.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
