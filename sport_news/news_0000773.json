Duke Johnson's 34-yard TD catch shows what the Browns dreamed about when they drafted him. They saw him as a running back who can be a tremendous asset in passing game. Mike Pettine talked during the week about getting the ball to Johnson \"in space\" where he could have room to run.\n2. Johnson caught seven passes in the first half for 82 yards. He also had 14 yards in four runs, but a couple of those were good jobs just to get past the line of scrimmage.\n3. This is a first for me ... second-guessing two of the first three play calls by the Browns in a game. Josh McCown opened with a 9-yard pass to Travis Benjamin. So it was 2nd-and-1. Then the Browns tried a dangerous sideways pass to Taylor Gabriel. It was incomplete. On 3rd-and-1, they tried a pass to Benjamin that was incomplete. That's right, the first three plays of the game were passes. This after offensive coordinator John DeFilippo called 54 pass plays (49 throws, 5 sacks) in last week's loss to Oakland.\n4. When McCown was hit and fumbled trying to pass, it was tight end Gary Barnidge who missed a block. But pressure also came from the other side of line. That was only the Chargers second sack of the season. Duke Johnson missed a block on that play. McCown was sacked three times in the first half.\n5. McCown was 19-of-26 passing for 212 yards in the first half. The Browns ran it only eight times.\n6. Keenan Allen beat Pierre Desir for a 28-yard TD. I do think Desir can play. He is starting in place of Joe Haden (ribs). Desir had three pass breakups in the first half.\n7. Isaiah Crowell's 32-yard run is the longest rush of season for Browns.\n8. Alex Mack had a holding penalty. It has been a rough start to 2015 for the center. That was Mack's third penalty of the year.\n9. Justin Gilbert is helping on kickoff returns, averaging 36 yards for his first two attempts.\n10. Dwayne Bowe played very little, dropping the only pass thrown to him in the first half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:38:02.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
