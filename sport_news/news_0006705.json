The Bengals are 4-0, and he's played about as well as any quarterback in the NFL.\nDalton has completed 78-of-116 passes for 1,187 yards and nine touchdowns with one interception. His passer rating of 123.0 is the best of the AFC.\nBut sometimes Dalton has a problem. Showtime's \"Inside the NFL,\" during its Tuesday night episode, showed Dalton discussing it with backup QB AJ McCarron on the bench. It concerns the problem of how to address an itch on the face when one is wearing eye black.\nAndy Dalton and AJ McCarron discuss real life problems on the sidelines ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #FirstWorldProblems #TheStruggleIsReal pic.twitter.com/e9kzRFCqtr\nâ€” NFL Retweet(@NFLRT) October 8, 2015 FOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE\nDalton is in his fifth season as the Bengals' starting quarterback. While Cincinnati has reached the playoffs in every season that he's been at the helm of the Bengals' offense, the team has an 0-4 postseason record in that span.\nMcCarron was the fifth-round draft choice of the Bengals out of Alabama in 2014. He missed most of last season because of a shoulder problem. He earned the backup job in training camp and is still awaiting his first NFL action in a regular-season game.\nRELATED: ALABAMA NFL ROUNDUP: T.J.
