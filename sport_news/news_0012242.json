This potentially fatal disease affects about 5.7 million Americans, according to the American Heart Association.\nThe study results were published Oct. 7 in the journal JACC: Heart Failure .\nCho said the obesity paradox does seem real, but perhaps only for women in cases of heart failure.\nOn the one hand, overweight and obese men with heart failure should lose weight to improve heart function. On the other hand, women don't need to get to an ideal normal body weight, Cho said.\nHowever, \"the message is not that women with heart failure should go out and eat ice cream and gain a whole bunch of weight,\" she said.\nCho cautioned that this study only shows an association between weight and survival. It doesn't prove that being overweight is the reason for a woman with heart failure living longer.\nWhile the mechanism behind the obesity paradox is unknown, Cho said it may be that women need more fatty acids than men for better heart function.\n\"We are just beginning to understand the difference gender makes in heart function,\" she said.\nLavie suggested that fitness, muscle mass and obesity severity also may play a role in the survival paradox.\nFor the study, Cho's team looked at medical records of more than 3,800 patients with heart failure.\nInitially, the investigators noted an overweight advantage among men and women. But the men's survival benefit disappeared after taking into account factors such as smoking, diabetes and medications. Obesity and overweight actually shortened men's lives compared to normal-weight males with heart failure, the researchers said.\nWomen with the greatest survival advantage had a BMI (body mass index) of between 25 and 29.9, the researchers found. BMI is a calculation of body fat based on height and weight. A BMI over 25 is overweight; over 30 is considered obese.\nMorbid obesity, a BMI of 40 or more, conferred no benefit, the researchers said.\nLavie said adults should strive to prevent heart failure in the first place. Maintaining a healthy weight is part of prevention, he said.\n\"Improving physical activity and fitness should be emphasized to prevent heart failure and improve its prognosis,\" Lavie said. Moderate and severe obesity need vigorous prevention and treatment, he added.\nMore information\nFor more on obesity, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nCopyright Â© 2015 ", "external_links": ["http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/", "http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:15:39.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
