For once the shoe was on the other foot as Karun fulfilled the role that F1's Charlie Whiting has been doing day in and day out.\nThe Chennai driver spent the weekend at the Buddh International Circuit (BIC) in Greater Noida taking up the mantle of race director for the JK Tyre Racing Championship round three and looked pleased with the change of role. The former F1 driver was pleased at the talent on show in the India series and Formula LGB races.\n\"The JK Racing India series and the Formula LGB are definitely good development series and stepping stone for promising racing drivers. There are plenty of options these days for them because you can always opt for Sportscar series or even Formula E. At the end of the day, you only have 20 seats in F1 and cost of these is increasing by the day,\" Karun told TOI at the BIC on Sunday.\nKarun, who turned out for Mahindra Racing in the inaugural Formula E series, has taken a couple of young drivers - brother Arjun and Kush Maini - under his wings. \"I have been spending a lot of time with both Arjun and Kush, helping them out with their training and trying to help them out with different people for possible drives. It is good to try and give something back to the sport which is what I have trying to do by mentoring the Nissan GT Academy drivers as well,\" the 31-year-old said.\nIn his own career, Karun has parted ways with Mahindra since he felt that the team was 'going backwards'. \"We had started the Formula E season pretty well but we didn't make any progress after a couple of races. We just kept going backwards. I couldn't keep on driving like this and decided to part ways,\" Karun, who is now looking for a long-term drive in a Sportscar series apart from Le Mans 24 Hours, said.\nDouble podium for Prasad\nChennai's Vishnu Prasad impressed in both the JK Racing India Series races on Sunday - winning one and finishing third in the other.\nYoung Ananth Shanmugam also managed two podiums by finishing third and second in the races.
