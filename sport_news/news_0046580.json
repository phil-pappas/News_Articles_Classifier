The team was heavily favored against the Longhorns two years ago and were upset by Case McCoy. Bob Stoops has said that the team doesn't dwell in the past, but, he's also said players like Ty Darlington have talked to him about the upset. Even if they aren't admitting that the loss is in the back of their minds, it's still hovering.\nFor Texas, a win would start to salvage its season. Two heartbreakingly close losses to Cal and Oklahoma State have dramatically changed the season's outlook for Charlie Strong's team. Another upset win against Oklahoma would take some pressure off Strong moving forward.\nWhen Oklahoma has the ball\nWill they run the ball? Bayer Mayfield has shown this season that he's talented enough to shoulder the load for the Sooners. But that doesn't mean he has to. Yes, Texas has some young defensive backs that Mayfield can take advantage of in the passing game. But Stoops has told the media that Oklahoma needs to get its running game going. Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon are talented backs that can take over games if needed.\nAlso keep an eye on Sterling Shepard. In his four-year career, he's had a game where he didn't have a single catch against the Longhorns while playing the entire time. His best performance came in last year's win when he had four catches for 60-plus yards and a touchdown. Other than that, he's been ineffective against Texas.\nWhen Texas has the ball\nCan Jerrod Heard be effective against Dominique Alexander and Eric Striker? Striker was flying all over the field last week in the Sooners' win against No. 23 West Virginia. He had 13 total tackles (three for a loss), two sacks and a forced fumble against a mobile quarterback in Skyler Howard. Alexander has also been Oklahoma's most consistent linebacker all season averaging 10 total tackles per game. It'll be interesting to see if Heard can be effective on the ground against these two linebackers.\nAlso keep an eye on Johnathan Gray. His Longhorn teams have defeated Oklahoma once in his career. In that game he had more than 100 yards rushing. In the two losses to the Sooners, he's averaged less than 20 yards on the ground. If Texas can get its running game going, which is a big if, that could play into their favor.\nPrediction\nOklahoma's defense was all over West Virginia's defense a week ago. It forced five turnovers after mustering up two total in its previous three games. Oklahoma is going to get its points, so Texas' offense is going to have to step up. That'll be tough to do with a porous offensive line that's let Heard be sacked 15 times this year in four games. In the end, the Sooners defense will be too much for the Longhorns to overcome, along with Mayfield's usual explosiveness on offense.\nScore: Oklahoma 48, Texas 38\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:06:09.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
