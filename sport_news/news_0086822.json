It's been a little bit of a dry period for me, I haven't won for a couple of years but I would dearly love to get back in that winner's circle.\" \n\nLee Westwood, another former world number one, also put together his best round of the week when he carded a four-under 67 for a total of 206. \n\nThe highlight of the 42-year-old Englishman's round was a chip-in birdie at the par-five seventh. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:19:30.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
