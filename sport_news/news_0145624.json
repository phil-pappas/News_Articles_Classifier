That's become the norm on Wednesdays this season after he dislocated his shoulder in the season opener. \nDespite that injury, Woodson has recorded a fourth-quarter interception in each of the past two games. He's the NFL's active leader in that category with 62 and ninth on the all-time list, one shy of tying Ronnie Lott and Darren Sharper. \nWoodson knows it wouldn't surprise anyone if he needed to take some time off to get his body healthy, but that's not how he approaches the game. \n\"That's the way I've always played the game from when I was a kid,\" Woodson said. \"It didn't matter if we were up or down in the game, how it was going, how you felt, you played until the end. It's just an example that I do try to provide for the guys on the team, especially the younger guys because I am 39 years old. They all look at it as if it would be easy for me to take a play off or take a day off or whatever. That's not what I'm about. I try to show that to those guys.\" \nThat message is well received in the locker room. Advertisement \n\"For him to be his age, and then to still have the production, it's outstanding,\" cornerback Neiko Thorpe said. \"For me, being out there with him, if something was to happen to me, I'd feel some type of way if I couldn't go knowing that he's playing through his injuries.\" \n\"It's definitely something we all look at,\" defensive end Aldon Smith said. \"I'm 26 and I feel like I can't complain about certain things because he's doing it and he's been doing it for a while and he does it at a high level. It makes you want to step up and play hard because you know you've got a guy out there who's been doing it for a long time at a high level.\" \nWoodson's career has intersected often with Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, who was runner-up to Woodson in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1997. They'll meet for the ninth time on Sunday, and Woodson is still looking for his first career interception against the NFL's all-time leader in touchdown passes. \n\"I don't want to put too much on it about being Peyton,\" Woodson said. \"Every time I step on the field, it doesn't matter who we're playing, I want to get an interception. This week will be no different. Would it be great to intercept Peyton? No question about it. This is about wins and losses. It's more important for us to get the win.\" \nManning, who turned 39 in March, said he isn't surprised to see Woodson still competing at his age. \n\"Charles is a great athlete, smart, obviously keeps himself in great shape,\" Manning said on a conference call. \"Real credit to him. Knowing the kind of athlete he was coming out of college really doesn't, but it's a real credit to him.\" \nFor some perspective, 39 is the same age Raiders coach Jack Del Rio was when he was hired for his first head-coaching job with the Jacksonville Jaguars. \n\"I thought I could still do it,\" Del Rio said of playing at that age, \"but he's doing it. It's pretty impressive to see what he's done. Same with Peyton. ... The way he takes care of his body and the commitment level that he has, the great competitor that he is, it's amazing to watch.\" \nTJ Carrie, who left Sunday's game with a chest injury, didn't practice Wednesday, and his status against the Broncos is unclear. Del Rio has indicated it doesn't appear to be a serious injury, and Carrie wasn't wearing the sling on his left arm that he sported on Sunday. \nCarrie said he wasn't allowed to get into specifics about his injury or playing status, but made it sound as though it's not much worse than the average wear and tear experienced during a game. \n\"I'm good, just bruised up from the game,\" Carrie said. \"That's just part of the game. Every week you're going to have little nicks and bruises no matter where it's at. You've just got to go out there and continue to recover and get back into the system.\" \nCornerback Keith McGill (foot) and defensive end Benson Mayowa (knee) returned to practice Wednesday, although both were limited. McGill missed the last game and Mayowa hadn't participated since the first half of the final preseason game in Seattle on Sept. 3. \nWide receiver Michael Crabtree, who missed a portion of the first half Sunday with an ankle injury, didn't suit up for practice. Defensive end Justin Tuck was also out. Like Woodson, he hasn't participated in a Wednesday practice since the week before the opener. Running back Latavius Murray was limited with a shoulder injury. \nRunning back Taiwan Jones (foot), defensive tackle Denico Autry (concussion), safety Taylor Mays (ankle) and defensive tackle C.J. Wilson (calf) all didn't participate. Defensive tackle Justin Ellis (ankle) and linebacker Ben Heeney (hamstring) were limited.
