Newton engineered touchdown drives on the Panthers’ last two possessions after the Seahawks grabbed a 23-14 lead. The Carolina quarterback was 12 of 15 for 169 yards in the fourth quarter to finish with 269 yards overall. \nJonathan Stewart also sparked the rally with his second one-yard TD run of the afternoon. Stewart had 78 yards on 20 carries. \nSeahawks QB Russell Wilson threw for 239 yards and ran for another 53, but the defending NFC champs are 2-4 following their second straight fourth-quarter meltdown.

The Packers blew a 17-3 lead before Rodgers hit James Jones for a tiebreaking, eight-yard scoring strike with 46 seconds left in the third quarter. \nRodgers finished with 255 passing yards and Starks had another 112 on the ground to help the Packers overcome a production game by Philip Rivers. \nThe outcome was in doubt until the Packers stopped San Diego on fourth-and-goal from the 3 with 15 seconds left. Rookie cornerback Damarious Randall lunged to poke away Rivers’ short pass to Danny Woodhead near the front right pylon to clinch it. \nRivers threw for two touchdowns while setting career highs with 43 completions, 65 attempts and 503 yards.

Manuel finished 28 of 42 for 263 yards with a touchdown and interception.

Jones hit Bryant for an 8-yard score to give the Steelers the lead. The two hooked up later for an 88-yard strike as the 4-3 Steelers won their second straight. \nJones completed 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and the two scores.

(AP) — Cameron Wake got his first four sacks this season and also forced two fumbles helping Miami beat Tennessee 38-10 in Dan Campbell’s debut as interim coach. \nThe 2-3 Dolphins entered the game having lost three straight, costing coach Joe Philbin his job Oct. 5. \nThe Dolphins finished with six sacks and intercepted Marcus Mariota twice.

(AP) — Brian Hoyer threw three touchdown passes on third down to lead Houston to a 31-20 victory over Jacksonville. DeAndre Hopkins grabbed two of the scoring tosses to help the Texas improve to 2-4. \nHoyer regained the starting job last week against Indianapolis and looked deserving of the spot. \nAndre Hal returned an interception 41 yards for a touchdown for the 2-4 Texas. It was the sixth pick-six thrown by Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles in 19 career starts. The 1-5 Jaguars have lost four in a row.
