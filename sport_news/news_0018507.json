Our running game was enough.”\nEast coach Brandon Matich\nSALT LAKE CITY — Too much speed and too much size created too many problems for the Highland Rams in the battle for the Region 5 championship Wednesday night.\nThe East Leopards, with eyes on what could be a special season, got 100+ rushing yards from Johnnie Lang , Jaylen Warren and Sione Molisi and whipped their rivals 31-6 on their home field.\n“We only had one real day to prepare, but we know these guys,” said East coach Brandon Matich as the East fans celebrated on the field afterward. “We played well. We didn’t need to pass. Our running game was enough.”\nThe game, of course, was played early due to the Utah Education Association holiday weekend. Now, the Leopards are rewarded with extra time to relish the win and prepare for their season finale.\nThe Leopards ran for 377 yards and while they improved to 6-2 overall and 4-0 in region play they also stayed undefeated against Utah opponents. East’s only two losses this year came to out-of-state powers Centennial (California) and Valor Christian (Colorado).\n“They’ve got a lot of fast athletes,” said Highland coach Brody Benson .\nThis year, the Rams were no match. Highland was held to just over 200 yards, and 51 of those came on a beautiful pass completion from quarterback James Pembroke to Nathan Roderick after the contest was decided. East’s line bottled up Highland’s usually potent running game and created plenty of space for itself on offense.\nEast averaged just over eight yards per carry. The Leopards also didn’t have any turnovers.\nJaylen Warren was East’s top rusher, finishing with 136 yards on 17 carries. He also had two touchdown runs in the first half as East built a 17-6 advantage. Molisi had 121 yards on just nine carries and a score and Lang ran 20 times for 118 yards and a TD.\nEast didn’t show any weaknesses, other than it failed to complete a pass. Lang was 0-for-3 through the air but, even though Highland had 10 days to prepare and figured East wasn’t going to run much, it didn’t matter.\nThe Rams trailed 14-0 early but got back into the game for a while when Pembroke completed a 17-yard throw to Ryan Lambson to keep a drive going. They eventually scored on a 1-yard run by Pembroke. The extra point was blocked by East’s Loa Kaufusi .\nEast broke the game open with scores on its first two possessions of the third quarter. Highland hurt itself with untimely penalties and had no answer as East ripped off impressive gains on almost every play. Lang used his quick feet to score on a 10-yard run to give the Leopards a 24-6 lead with 6:58 left. Five minutes later, Molisi broke free on a 31-yard run.\n“Highland always comes in with a good game plan and they surprised us a little at first,” said Matich. “Our defense is fast, and everybody played with a passion tonight.”\nWith one regular-season game remaining at home vs. Woods Cross next week, East is assured of at least a tie for first place in region and a No. 1 seed in the upcoming 4A playoffs. Highland (5-3, 3-1) can still clinch a No. 2 seed by beating Bonneville.\nBruce Smith grew up in Boise, Idaho, and is a longtime newspaper sports writer.
