It was just those long completions that really hurt us.” Jamie Harms Connally quarterback Robert Patterson, looking to pass against Hutto last week in a District 17-5A matchup, threw and ran for a touchdown against Waco High on Thursday night, but the Cougars lost 21-14. CREDIT: Jamie Harms/For American-Statesman \nOriginally scheduled to start at 7 p.m., the game was delayed 38 minutes after the officiating crew was caught in stand-still traffic, the result of an overturned 18-wheeler on southbound Interstate 35 near Temple. \nIt was the first of two delays in a bizarre game that featured 202 penalty yards, including the ejection of a LaCurtis Jones — a former Waco High and Baylor football player who was standing on the sidelines. \nEarly in the third quarter, Waco punter Alexis Arringa was injured on a helmet-to-helmet play after a low snap. Arringa was taken off the field on a stretcher, and the injury resulted in a 25-minute delay. \n“That was tough,” Cecil said. “Prayers are with that kid.” \nAfter the game, Waco coach Matt Herbst said Arringa was moving his fingers and toes and was responsive to those caring for him at a nearby hospital. \nOnce the officials arrived at the field, Waco took control of the game on the opening drive. On the Lions’ third offensive play, Jalen Harris connected with Donnelle Swinnie for a 62-yard touchdown. \nConnally (2-4, 0-2) punted on the ensuing series, and Harris capitalized with a 41-yard touchdown strike to LoDamien Calhoun down the left sideline. \nAfter clicking on its first two drives, Waco helped Connally get back into the game with a trio of personal fouls. \nFirst the Lions were assessed a pair of personal fouls following a punt return, call that pushed them back to their 11. Five plays later, Connally blocked a punt before scoring on an 11-yard touchdown run by Robert Patterson that followed another penalty against Waco. \nWaco answered back on its ensuing drive, as but Harris connected with Swinnie for a 71-yard touchdown pass with 7:06 to go before halftime. \nConnally scored the only touchdown of the second half two plays after the injury to Arringa, when Patterson threw to Mitchell Moorman for a 20-yard touchdown. \nSt. Andrew’s 55, S.A. Hawkins 12: Cole Baker rushed for two touchdowns and Evan Marshman threw for three scores and ran for a fourth as St. Andrew’s rolled to a road win in San Antonio. \nThe Crusaders (5-1) led 48-0 at halftime, as Blais Herman caught touchdown passes of 10 and 14 yards from Marshman and Baker scored on carries of 7 and 19 yards. Marshman also tossed a 26-yard TD pass to Alex Briggs, and the quarterback scored on a 4-yard run, too. \nSan Antonio Hawkins slipped to 0-5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:30:08.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
