Evan Leversage’s mom, Nicole Wellwood, heard the news no mother ever wants to hear; “Her son’s cancer had grown and spread to other parts of his brain – despite numerous rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment.” Fearing the 7-year-old wouldn’t make it to the holidays, she was encouraged to celebrate Christmas with Evan earlier this year. With a broken heart, she asked her family if they would all support their Christmas in October. \nNot only did Wellwood’s family rally behind the mother and son, but her cousins created a GoFundMe page and a Facebook page to request the help of their community to make this Christmas special, as it will most likely be Evan’s last. \nWord spread like wildfire and it wasn’t long before all of St George, Canada started stringing up lights and decorations early. Some went as far as organizing a Christmas parade, which is scheduled to pass Evan’s house on Saturday, October 24th. ‘Everywhere you look it’s Christmas. It’s more than I could have imagined.’ Wellwood added, ‘It’s pretty crazy. A lot of people have really went above and beyond.’ \nEvan has been battling with this disease for most of his life. His brain tumor was diagnosed just days before his second birthday. He’s deteriorated so quickly this last year. An “MRI revealed the youngster’s cancer had grown and spread” in July. Even after years of treatment, there was nothing more Evan’s doctors could do for him. \nIt’s damn near impossible to hear this story and not have a lump in your throat and a pain in your chest. It’s heartbreaking to know that an innocent child is experiencing something so horrifying. Yet, he maintains a light spirit and continues to enjoy the simple things in life. I ask everyone to send a Christmas greeting to Evan this weekend. You might be out buying your Halloween costume and think it’s too early to think about the holidays, but there’s never a better time to be kind.
