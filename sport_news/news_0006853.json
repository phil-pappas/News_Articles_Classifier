Head coach Brady Pennington leads a 4-1 team through a tough district that includes two state-title contenders in Crosby and CE King. \nThrough half the season, the Eagles offense has put up a district best 216 points thanks to its trio of talented offensive players, quarterback Timmy Ware, running back Marte Allison, and receiver David Harvey. \nWare is a tough choice over Crosby’s Triston Cotton, but the fact that Ware has put the Eagles in position to make the playoffs for the first time in more than a decade is enough to give him the edge. It also doesn’t hurt that Ware has put up 15 touchdowns to just three interceptions thus far. \nAt running back, CE King’s speedy tailback Tray Williams is off to a monster start with 655 yards through five games, but Allison isn’t far off with 570 of his own. \nThe receiver position in District 21-5A is as strong as there is in the State of Texas, with young men like Harvey and the all-purpose threat Emmanual Netherly from Crosby leading the charge. Harvey has 27 catches for nearly 700 yards in the first half of 2015, while the junior Netherly is already showing off why so many Division I schools want him with 565 yards receiving and nine touchdowns. \nEven with the wealth of talent Crosby has at the skill positions, the biggest cause for the Cougars success this season can be chalked up to their impressive offensive line play, therefore it was an easy choice to give the nod for best lineman thus far to big, bad Keenan Murphy, Crosby’s bruiser of a left tackle. \nHumble gets on the board as well for an impressive start to the season on defense. Linebacker Langston Tunson is a force on that side of the ball, racking up key tackles for the Wildcats on seemingly every drive. Tunson and his Wildcats still have an uphill battle if they plan on making the playoffs this season, but no one in District 21-5A is taking them lightly with players like Tunson lining up across from them. \nJoshua Koch's 21-5A All-District Team QB: Tristen Cotton – Crosby WR: David Harvey – New Caney WR: Manny Netherly - Crosby RB: Tray Williams – C.E. King RB: Mart’e Allison – New Caney Defender: Aldin Adamek – New Caney O-Line: New Caney’s Coach: Brady Pennington-New Caney District 21-5A is going to be a district that many will be talking about deep into December and maybe even into the final weekend of the Texas High School Football playoffs. For good reason too, there are definitely quality teams and players that have put this district into the limelight, being highlighted by Crosby’s State Semifinal run from a year ago. This season has gone about how we expected, with Crosby and C.E. King sitting atop the standings, but right there in the mix is New Caney. Following a 4-6 year, returning senior quarterback Timmy Ware and multiple offensive weapons, the Eagles have really made some big impressions in 2015. Brady Pennington has this team going in the right direction and are in line for a potential playoff spot. Really the best thing Pennington has done is brought in a great staff, the hire of quarterback coach Billy Noonan in the offseason, which has paid off big dividends, reuniting quarterback Timmy and offensive coordinator Blake Ware with an former player and family friend. Pennington’s defense has also wreaked havoc in 21-5A, the third best defense in the district. All this wrapped into one is why Pennington is the mid-season coach of the year. Moving onto the team now, picking a top quarterback was tough, but the consistency of Crosby’s Tristen Cotton has been impressive. Guiding the Cougars to the State Semifinals a year ago, the senior has them on that same path again. Cotton second in 21-5A with 1,246 yards along with 15 touchdowns and four interceptions, while completing 69 percent of his passes. Cotton has one more interception than Ware, but I have to go with Cotton because of the experience, especially in the playoffs, which I believe will play a big role down the stretch. At running back it is easy to pick Tray Williams out of C.E. King and Mart’e Allison from New Caney. Both have been running the ball effectively thus far. Williams, the TCU commit, is leading the district with 655 yards and eight touchdowns, while averaging an impressive 9.78 yards per carry. Allison is hot on the heels of Williams with 570 yards and eight scores. The wide receiving core in District 21-5A has been nothing but impressive and it’s been fun to see a pair of guys, David Harvey and Manny Netherly have breakout years. Harvey, out of New Caney, has opened a lot of eyes and dropped some jaws this season with the plays he’s made downfield and some of the gaudy numbers he’s put up. Harvey has racked up 698 yards receiving in the first five games, which ranks 37 th in the country and 4 th in the State of Texas. On the other side, Netherly, only a junior is having a breakout season doubling all of his numbers from a year ago in just half the time. Netherly is on pace to reach more than 1,000 yards receiving this year, entering Week 6 with 565 yards and nine touchdowns. These two will be fun to watch. Defensively there are a lot of quality players in 21-5A but none like Aldin Adamek. The senior has been a one-man wrecking ball, recording 63 tackles, averaging 15.3 per game so far, and has notched 12 tackles for loss. Along with the tackles, Adamek leads the team with five sacks, averaging 1.3 per game this season. Adamek is a fun player to watch and will be interesting to see if colleges start to take notice of what he has been able to do and is doing right now at New Caney. Finally, supposed to pick one offensive lineman but that is tough. So I have gone with the entire New Caney offensive line. A group with seniors and some underclassmen has helped protect the district’s best quarterback and also allowed some solid rushing performances. New Caney’s front seven has allowed 1,055 yards rushing and more than 1,300 yards passing. To produce this kinds of numbers midway through a season is impressive, especially the defenses they have had to face. Them protecting Ware and allowing running room for him and Allison will be the major key to the Eagles getting back to the postseason.
