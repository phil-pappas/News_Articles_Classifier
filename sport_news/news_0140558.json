Here, I can blend in a little bit more.”\nJimmer Fredette\nThe University of Utah football program got a heavy dose of coverage from ESPN on Wednesday in the run-up to its appearance on the network's \"College GameDay\" show, with two extensive features about the program.\nIn one , Chantel Jennings calls Kyle Whittingham's special teams unit \"the most interesting position unit in college football.\"\nHighlighting the unique paths Andy Phillips, Britain Covey, Tom Hackett, Chase Dominguez and Boobie Hobbs all took to arrive at Utah, Jennings concludes that \"they’ve contributed on and off the field and have been a refreshing reminder that special teams can be fun and interesting — and that #SpecialistsArePeopleToo.\"\nAnother story by Ted Miller examines the Polynesian culture's influence on the program.\nMiller notes the Utes ' smashmouth style of play, and points to the fact that a large contingent of their offensive and defensive lines are Polynesian. In that vein, Miller highlights the notions of a warrior mentality among the Polynesian players, as well as the fact that they're able to bond well and become like a family unit.\n\"We take pride in being a Polynesian pipeline, that Polynesian mentality,\" offensive guard Isaac Asiata said. \"Samoan or Tongan, there's no 'fefe.' That's no fear.\"\nCal's Jared Goff featured on ESPN\nfeatured in a \"Big Man On Campus\" video segment.\nThe junior, who was a big fan of the Golden Bears growing up, is already is the school's all-time leader in passing yards, total yards and completions (along with 19 other records).\nHe is expected to be one of the first players selected in the 2016 NFL Draft.\nAt one point during the 2:22 piece, Goff is asked if he's excited about College GameDay.\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"I'll probably be doing a lot of media this week.\"\nJimmer Fredette featured\nFormer BYU basketball star Jimmer Fredette's fight to make the San Antonio Spurs' roster was featured Wednesday by Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News.\nOnce one of the best college basketball players in the country, Fredette is in a battle with two other players just to claim the final spot on Gregg Popovich's team. Still, he says he enjoys the anonymity he experiences in San Antonio, particularly compared to what it's like when he comes to the Beehive State.\n“It’s still pretty tough in Salt Lake, or anywhere in Utah, to go out without being recognized,” Fredette said. “Here, I can blend in a little bit more.”\nRyan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com .
