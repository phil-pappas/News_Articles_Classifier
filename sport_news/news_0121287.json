James “J.T.” Thomas 364 CONNECT 33 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe date was Sept. 12, 1970. \nThe Florida State Seminoles were minutes away from pregame introductions at Doak Campbell Stadium on a humid Saturday evening. \nJames “J.T.” Thomas was set to make history as the first African American to play varsity football at FSU, which was opening the season against Louisville. \nBut Thomas’ mind was elsewhere. \nThomas was still enraged that FSU assistant coach Bill Parcells had embarrassed him in practice a day earlier. Thomas, a sophomore defensive back, fumed over comments he felt were too personal. \n“I am still upset, not really thinking about the game,” Thomas said. \nThat changed, by necessity, when Thomas emerged from the locker room and peered at the crowd of 27,389. Reality stared back at the Macon, Georgia, native in colors of the day – garnet, gold and lily white. \n“That’s when it hit me, ‘Oh my God.’ All the noise kind of ceased for a second when they (fans) saw me,” Thomas said and laughed. \n“Like, ‘There he is. That’s him.’ ” \nThomas played a sensational game, blocking what would have been a winning field goal by the Cardinals in the final seconds of FSU’s 9-7 victory. \nThomas developed into an All-American while at FSU and enjoyed an outstanding professional career with the Pittsburgh Steelers, winning four Super Bowl rings as a member of the famed \"Steel Curtain\" defense. \nThomas may have taken that significant first step into history at FSU, but he was not alone. Thomas was one of four black players on scholarship that varsity season 45 years ago. \nJoined by fellow Georgian Bobby Anderson of Tifton and Floridians Eddie McMillan of Tampa and Charlie Hunt of Jacksonville, the quartet persevered. \nThey overcame challenges and adversity, contributed on the field and in the classroom and helped promote social change on FSU’s campus during the turbulent 1970s. \nFor the first time since their final college season in 1972, the four players – now in their mid-60s, all husbands, fathers and productive citizens – will be reunited at Doak Campbell Stadium for Saturday’s noon game against Louisville. \nCharlie Hunt (Photo: FSU Sports Information) \nTheir steps out to the field for introductions during the first quarter will retrace their brave journeys. \n“As we look back on it, we understand, but we really did not at the time because we were young kids,” McMillan said. \n“We did not understand the historical significance and impact of what we were actually doing. It was a very chaotic time, the country was going through a bad period, a renaissance, it was changing. \n“I think because of what we did, the way we carried ourselves, the way we were able to overcome adversity, I think that was a template and we set the bar for everybody and others who came after us.” \nPeterson Makes Bold Decision \nA handful of African American students began to enroll in classes at FSU in the mid-1960s. \nLenny Hall became the first black basketball player recruited in 1966. \nIn 1968, FSU football coach Bill Peterson recruited and signed two black players – Calvin Patterson from Miami and Ernest Cook Jr. from Daytona Beach. \nFSU coach Bill Peterson (Photo: FSU Sports Information) \nCook, however, changed his mind about FSU and attended Minnesota, where he was an All-Big Ten player. \nPatterson enrolled at FSU and was the first black player to break the color barrier in football, playing on the freshman team – freshmen were ineligible to play varsity football until the NCAA changed the rule in 1972. \nHowever, academic struggles and hardships kept Patterson off the field as a varsity player. Before the start of practice during his senior year in 1972, Patterson committed suicide when he shot himself in the midsection. \n“Although his name does not appear in any FSU record books, his role in FSU football history is a significant one,” former FSU quarterback (1966-70) Tommy Warren said in a first-person account in FSU Voices . “FSU fans and players owe him recognition and thanks.\" \nIn 1969, Thomas, Anderson, McMillan, Hunt and Kevin Smith of West Palm Beach signed with the Seminoles and played on the freshman team. \nWhile Smith returned to West Palm Beach, Thomas (receiver/defensive back), Anderson (defensive line), McMillan (receiver/defensive back) and Hunt (defensive end/quarterback) stayed on course. \n“Tifton was only 90 miles away and I figured if it didn’t work out, I could always hitchhike home,” Anderson said and laughed. \nTallahassee was the players’ second home. \nThey helped the Seminoles finish 7-4 in 1970 in Patterson’s final season and won 15 games with a Fiesta Bowl appearance in coach Larry Jones’ first two years in Tallahassee. All four graduated and three – Thomas (Steelers), McMillan (Rams) and Hunt (49ers) – played in the NFL. \nLife happens, and the years – make that decades – have passed. \nThomas remained in Pittsburgh following his NFL career. McMillan landed in Seattle, Anderson in Atlanta and Hunt returned to his hometown of Jacksonville, where he has coached high school football and track for 30-plus years. His son, Charles Hunt, Jr., was a walk-on football player at FSU in the early 2000s. \nThe quartet’s FSU memories are vivid – and most are good. \n“I think it’s going to be very, very, very emotional,” Hunt said of Saturday’s recognition at Doak Campbell Stadium. \n“I think we will probably remember what it was like, the whole experience of being together, having the chance to play and the whole atmosphere of being recognized. It will be a thrill to get back and share old times with good people.” \nA Lasing Impact \nHistorians have increasingly portrayed the 1970s as a \"pivot of change.” \nIt was happening on the football field as black football players across the south were breaking the color barrier at established Division I programs. \nLeonard George of Tampa was the first black football player at the University of Florida, signing a scholarship in 1968. Five black players made their debuts at the University of Georgia in 1971, one year after Thomas and Co. crossed the color barrier on the varsity team at FSU. \n“First and foremost, I love each and every one of these guys without hesitation. They are family,” said Barry Smith, a member of the 1969 Seminole recruiting class from Miami who orchestrated Saturday’s reunion. The Tampa resident even hired a detective to locate McMillan. \nEddi McMillan (Photo: FSU Sports Information) \n“We all shared a common thread of wanting to rise above all the issues of our generation,” added Smith, who also played in the NFL and is a loyal supporter of FSU. \n“We wanted to excel. Being a jock, at least from my perspective, there was no color issue from where I sat. We were just all guys trying to make it through. They were motivated. You could see it in their demeanor, the way they worked. They weren’t given a free pass but the opportunity to make it just like the rest of us.” \nQuarterback Gary Huff, also part of the 1969 recruiting class from Tampa, was impressed by the four’s abilities. \nHunt, for example, was 6 foot 4 and, by all accounts, could throw a football 80 yards, flat-footed. McMillan signed with FSU with the promise from coaches to his mother that the prep All-American speedster could run track, too. \nThomas started his FSU career at receiver before being moved to defensive back. And Anderson, at 5 foot 9, was an outstanding interior defensive lineman whose older brother played football at Michigan State. \nAt that time, there weren’t NCAA guidelines on the size of signing classes, and Huff – sixth on the depth chart at quarterback – recalls the Seminoles signing 58 players. \nHe said many did not last the entire freshman season, which featured a trip to Mexico City against National Autonomous University and a showdown versus Miami in a driving rainstorm in Tampa Stadium. \nFSU’s freshmen were also known as the “Green Turds” for their lime-green practice jerseys, and the way they were treated by coaches and upperclassmen. \nJames \"J.T.\" Thomas (Photo: FSU Sports Information) \nHuff said skin color was not an issue. \n“A lot of us did not think much of it,” said Huff, associate director of Business Service at FSU and a former NFL player. \n“As teammates, we didn’t think one way or another about that. All my life through sports I didn’t care who was blocking for me. Whoever was the best I loved him. They were all good guys and I thought they fit in real well.” \nThey also led the way for other black football players to follow in their footsteps at FSU. \nFormer FSU linebacker (1990-92) Marvin Jones, who had his No. 55 jersey retired at last Saturday’s home game against Miami and played 10 years in the NFL, all with the New York Jets, applauded the quartet’s fortitude. \n“To have guys come in that were willing to have the courage to want change, to be one of the guys to step up and make a change, those guys should be appreciated,” Jones said. \n“These are guys who should be recognized and guys who should be talked about and honored. A lot of people don’t want to go back and revisit those times, but I think that it’s important that people know.” \nIn Their Own Words \nThomas on the racial climate in Tallahassee: \n“Tallahassee was a very difficult place at that time for African-Americans. Even going to Florida A&M – you figure the common denominator – we weren’t welcome there and I think we got ran back. We really weren’t welcome initially at FAMU (because) it was (like), ‘You are going to the white university,’ that type of deal. It was tough. The pretense going in (at FSU), you as an African-American, you can’t compete on the athletic field or in the classroom... You were there because you were told you couldn’t make it. We were overcoming that doubt that was being placed in your mind that you can’t compete here. That was the environment that we were dealing with. You had those attitudes within in the coaching staff as well as in the classroom. We knew what was happening, that was part of the culture.” \nMcMillan on coach Peterson: \n“Let me tell you about coach Peterson (laughing). Coach Peterson had Alzheimer’s back then. He was very smart, a very brilliant coach but he couldn’t remember anyone’s name. He’d always call me ‘McWilliams.’ Come here McWilliams. My name is McMillan, not McWilliams (laughing). Bill Peterson was ahead of his time. He was very, very innovative, especially in the passing game. When he left and any time we played in Houston, I’d go visit him at Rice. And he’d still call my damn name, he’d still call me McWilliams.” \nBobby Anderson (Photo: FSU Sports Information) \nMcMillan on former FSU teammates: \n“I get emails and letters from white guys on the team all the time. Thanks a lot for the experience because what it did was it showed us the things we were taught and told weren’t necessarily true and you have to judge each individual by the context of their character and not the color of their skin. When I get emails, texts and calls from guys that I played with that said, ‘Hey, this changed my life, changed the way I deal with people....’ This is what makes me feel good, that we had an impact not only our ourselves but on society for the good.” \nAnderson on FSU career: \n“I feel like it was a growing experience for me. I was on my own, making my own decisions, receiving a college education. We didn’t get out much in the community, but we felt we had the support of the community. I am sure there was some attitudes about (what was happening). But football is like a melting pot. We shared a common cause, a common goal and a common struggle. It was tough, but it was that way for everyone on the team.” \nHunt on FSU career: \n“I have very fond memories. We encountered some things that were problematic but overall things could have been worse. But they weren’t as bad as they could have been. I am sure in other places in America there where things that were going on at the same time that were very problematic. The guys we were with helped things to be as smooth as they were. It was a great bunch of guys who came in as freshmen together. From all walks of life and from all areas of the United States. Yet things, I think, were very, very well, especially for 18-, 19-years-old boys to deal with stuff that wasn’t being dealt with by adults very well. But I think, really truly, I’ve been blessed to have my life guided and directed the way it has been.” \nMcMillan on FSU experience: \n“I always have to compliment Florida State and the people and the students, and this is the reason why. I’ve talked to a lot of guys who played at other schools in the south during that same period of time and they had a tremendous amount of adversity. They had hate mail, they had people yelling and screaming at the them the n-word. We never experienced that, not one time at Florida State. Nowhere. When I tell some of the other guys that, they are absolutely amazed. ‘Oh man, we caught hell.’ ” \nThomas Saves The Day \nFSU held a 9-7 lead over Louisville with less than 20 seconds left in its 1970 season opener. \nMoments earlier, Thomas had blocked what would have been the winning 33-yard field goal for the Cardinals. However, Thomas was whistled off sides, giving the visitors a second chance, this time from 28 yards. \n“I felt like the turkey,” Thomas said. \nNot for long. \nFSU assistant coach Bill Parcells (Photo: FSU Sports Information) \nThomas blocked the second attempt, preserving the victory and igniting the celebration. Thomas, who also blocked a Louisville field goal in the second quarter, felt much better than he did prior to the game. \nThomas still was upset. He said Bill Parcells, who coached linebackers and went onto to win two Super Bowl rings as the head coach of the New York Giants, questioned his abilities in front of the team in practice a day earlier. \nThomas said Parcells’ mood did not change on game day, looking at him with disdain in the locker room before the team headed out for introductions. \n“I am so pissed at Bill Parcells I can’t see straight,” Thomas said. \nThree hours later, as the Seminoles enjoyed their victory in the locker room, Thomas saw Parcells headed his way. The player did not know what to expect. \n“He grabs me and hugs me and says you are a bad MF,” Thomas said and laughed. \n“At the time I didn’t realize, until even years later, what he done. He had taken my mind off that event, this debut (and pressure) for the most part, and put the focus on him. I wasn’t thinking that way at the time. I was thinking he was being a jerk and now we are friends because we won the game. \n“But when I look back, I think he understood the moment. He took me out of the moment for the whole day. \n“It was a great moment, no doubt about it.” \nContact Jim Henry at jjhenry@tallahassee.com and follow on Twitter at @JimHenryTALLY 364 CONNECT 33 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1LrATie TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:18:25.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
