Watts had three children.\nNearly 20 relatives attended the brief hearing, in which Jackson appeared via video.\n“To see so many people in the same room and realize how many lives one person has affected, it really hit home,” said Det. Jim Lawrence, a member of the Portland Police Bureau’s Cold Case Homicide Unit.\nFOX 12 previously profiled the unit’s efforts to solve the murders of Jackson , Watts and Anderson .\nLawrence, one of the investigators who worked on the cases for years, said it was satisfying to see the suspect in court.\nAccording to court documents, Jackson committed the murders in the course of committing sexual abuse or in immediate flight from the crime.\nDetectives believe Jackson targeted the women because they were victims of sex trafficking.\nCourt documents state Jackson admitted he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2011 and currently takes two medications to treat the condition. Court documents also state Jackson is a daily user of alcohol.\nJackson, who lives in northeast Portland, was previously convicted of discharging a firearm in the city in 2006.\nHis criminal record also includes criminal mischief and burglary convictions from the 1980s and early 2000s, as well as various traffic related violations.\nHe is being held without bail.\nDetectives are investigating Jackson in connection with other crimes, as well.\nAdditionally, Lawrence said detectives received dozens of phone calls over the weekend about Jackson, including from some people who claim to be victims of Jackson.\nAnyone who has information about these cases should contact Detective Meredith Hopper at (503) 823-0865; meredith.hopper@portlandoregon.gov; or Detective Jim Lawrence at (503) 823-0867, james.lawrence@portlandoregon.gov.\nCopyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
