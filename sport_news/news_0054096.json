While the average dropped to 2:53 in the first half of the season, it was back at 3:00 after the All-Star break. \nMLB and the players' association agreed this year to enforce the rule requiring a hitter to keep at least one foot in the batter's box in many cases, and they also agreed to post stadium clocks timing pitching changes and between-inning breaks. \nTriple-A and Double-A leagues, the highest levels of the minors, used 20-second pitch clocks and started penalizing violators with balls and strikes. At Triple-A, the International League average dropped 16 minutes to 2:40 and the Pacific Coast League fell 13 minutes to 2:45. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:32:44.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
