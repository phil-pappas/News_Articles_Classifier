But, as the Rams should fully understand, you can throw out the records when the two District 2-4A rivals meet. “ The question is what does this game mean to us? What is our mindset?” Bastrop coach Brad Bradshaw asked. “I would think it would mean something to this group of seniors.” Bradshaw's questions are legitimate as Bastrop's current seniors have a 1-3 career record against the Patriots. Franklin Parish beat the Rams 23-20 in 2012 and 59-42 in 2013. Bastrop won the 2014 regular season meeting 36-22, but the Patriots had the final say with a 48-44 first-round playoff victory in Ram Stadium. “ I showed our kids one clip from the playoff game,” Bradshaw said. “It showed the emotion they had on the last play of the game and the emotion we had.” It's been a tumultuous campaign from the outset for the Patriots, whose season started out on a tragic note. Tyrell Cameron died from injuries suffered on a special teams play in the season opener against Sterlington. Starting off 0-3, the Patriots fell to Sterlington (14-0), Wossman (43-18) and South Beauregard (34-7). Closing out pre-district play, Franklin Parish edged Richwood 28-27 before bowing to Class 5A Natchitoches Central (27-6). Picking up their second win, the Patriots handled Grant Parish 45-22 in the district opener before coming out on the short end of a 35-14 road decision to West Ouachita last week. Turnovers have been a source of frustration for the Patriots, who carry only two seniors (offensive linemen Bryan Hollis and Tyler Spann) on the roster. In fact, Franklin turned the ball over inside its own 20 on the first two plays of the game against West Ouachita. “ Franklin Parish's trouble has come from turning the ball over. It's not a lack of talent,” Bradshaw said. “West Ouachita is going to score if they get inside the 20. They also had a pick and another fumble. If you spot West Ouachita 28 points, you're not going to have the ball enough to get that many points back.” Page 2 of 2 - Still, Bradshaw views the Patriots as a dangerous opponent, which is understandable considering the recent history of the series. “ They're very big and they have some speed,” Bradshaw said. “They're the same type of team we played in the playoffs.” Coming off of a 45-22 Week 6 loss to Neville, the Rams took care of Tioga 59-16 last week. Bastrop's offensive line of Kintavius Cash, Tony King, Kendrick “Scooter” Jones, Jordan Reese and Tyshawn Downs turned in one of its better outings against Tioga. Bradshaw says the group will need to duplicate that effort Friday night. “ I was happy with the progress the offensive line made last week,” Bradshaw said. “I hope it continues this week. Physically, Franklin Parish is the second-best team we have lined up against, next to Neville.” Bastrop added 11 players to its varsity roster Tuesday from its freshman team. Bradshaw said some of the freshmen could see significant playing time in the final two regular season games against Grant and West Ouachita. “ Once they figure out what's going on, they are going to be able to help us,” Bradshaw said. “I'm proud of that bunch for going 7-1. I'm proud of the effort they gave, along with the coaches.” With 33 seniors on the roster, the door of opportunity will be open to the sophomores next season. “ The freshman team is going to pay huge dividends down the road because most of them are going to play next year,” Bradshaw said. “Some of them are about to play right now. The good thing about these kids is coach (Albert) Tippett has instilled some toughness in them. Obviously, that is something I think the (varsity) program is lacking.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:31:41.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
