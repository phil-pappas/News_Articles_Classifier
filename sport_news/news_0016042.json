After a day of pomp alongside Queen Elizabeth, Communist Party General Secretary Xi on Wednesday met Cameron in his Downing Street residence where the visit’s biggest deal so far - to invest in nuclear plants - was due to be announced. In the first major Chinese investment in a Western nuclear facility, China’s General Nuclear Corporation (CGN) will take a one-third stake in the planned 18 billion pound ($28 billion) Hinkley Point nuclear plant owned by France’s EDF. State-owned CGN will also take a two-thirds stake in the Bradwell nuclear plant east of London, where it plans to build a Chinese-designed reactor, and a one-fifth stake in a project for Areva -designed reactors at the Sizewell plant. “China and the UK are increasingly interdependent and are becoming a community of shared interests,” Xi said in a speech to both houses of parliament on Tuesday. Escorted by Prince William, the queen’s grandson, Xi inspected a new battery-powered black taxi to be produced by London Taxi Company, which is owned by China’s Geely. Cameron is pitching Britain as the pre-eminent Western gateway for investment from China, though the warmth of the reception for Xi has raised some eyebrows with allies and drawn criticism that London is ignoring China’s human rights record. Protests on the street against the Communist leader have been small so far, despite activists accusing Cameron of courting Chinese money while brushing aside criticism of a crackdown in civil liberties since Xi came to power in 2012. British officials and business leaders say the rise of China is impossible to ignore: China’s economy is four times the size of Britain’s. China on Wednesday nearly doubled a bilateral currency swap agreement with Britain to 350 billion yuan ($55 billion), part of Beijing efforts to spur more use of the yuan abroad. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:09:08.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
