Lions' Emmanuel Arceneaux, right, celebrates after scoring a touchdown against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats during the first half of a CFL football game in Vancouver, B.C., on Friday October 23, 2015. Photograph by: Darryl Dyck , CP \nIf this goes according to plan, there will be other nights like this, nights when Jonathon Jennings dazzles and delights, nights when B.C. Place is alive and the B.C. Lions roll to a convincing win in the fall. \nBut remember this one because if felt like a beginning. Remember this one because as much as Jennings has offered glimpses of a bright future, Friday night the curtain was pulled back and it was revealed what this team could be. In the latest version of their biggest game of the season, the Lions authored their most complete, most comprehensive effort of 2015. throttling the East Division-leading Hamilton Tiger-Cats 40-13 in front of 20,058 fans. \nThis time there was no comedic collapse in the second half. This time there was no collective nervous breakdown. There was only a poised, confident performance and it starts with the 23-year-old rookie who looks like a game-changer for this franchise. \n\"We've been working our tails off,\" said linebacker Adam Bighill. \"We've been grinding. It's nice to see some reward for how hard we've worked. \n\"To win is one thing but to show what kind of physically dominant team we can be is critical, especially come playoff time. We've felt this one coming for a while, man.\" \nBut it took its sweet time getting here. \nOn the first play from scrimmage, Ticats rookie quarterback Jeff Mathews speared Luke Tasker with a 66-yard touchdown strike and you could excuse the faithful for thinking, 'Could this season get any worse.' \nBut five minutes later, the 'Cats conceded a safety after a Richie Leone punt left the visitors on their own two-yard line; Chris Rainey returned the ensuing kickoff 67 yards; and Jennings hit Shawn Gore with a 20-yard touchdown pass on the next play. \nAnd the Lions were transformed. \nJennings would end the first half completing 15 of 20 passes for 178 yards and three touchdowns, highlighted by a magical 25-yard TD pass to that man Rainey as the Leos built a 24-6 lead before putting the Ticats away with a punishing, clinical second half. \nOK, in the interests of full disclosure, Jennings wasn't as dynamic over the final 30 minutes. Then again, he didn't have to be because Andrew Harris awoke from a somnolent first half with a monster performance in the final quarter. \nHarris, who was limited to eight yards rushing in the first half, romped over 83 yards and two touchdowns on 10 carries in the game's final 10 minutes, sealing the deal emphatically for a team which had watched their season eaten away by second-half failures. \n\"It's about the rhythm and when you get into that rhythm and feel it, it makes it that much easier,\" said Harris, who finished the night with 119 yards on the ground. \n\"We definitely got the monkey off our back tonight. This is a good team we have here. For us to put up the points we did and have our defence play the way they did, it was a big turning point.\" \nAh yes, the defence. On the night, the Lions sacked Mathews five times while recording four turnovers. Special teams, you ask? After a series of deplorable outings, they kept Hamilton's lethal Brandon Banks in check in the return game while springing Rainey for his 66-yard return. \n\"It's a total team effort, when something like this happens,\" said Lions head coach Jeff Tedford of his 6-10 team. \"I'm proud of the guys for continuing to work hard and continuing to believe after a couple of tough weeks.\" \nEarlier in the night, the Montreal crushed Toronto, moving the Als momentarily into the CFL's playoff spot. But with their win, the Lions maintain control of the playoff race and the task before them remains clear. Win their final two games of the regular season - away to Toronto next week and home to Calgary in the finale - and they're in. \nIt's that clear. It's also not that easy. \nTedford was asked if, at long last, his team has turned around its season. \n\"You know, we've been playing well at times,\" he said. \"We just haven't finished games. But this needs to be (the start of something). We need to take the confidence out of this game and continue to move on. \n\"Hopefully, it's something we can build on. It was just really nice to see them have success tonight.\" \nAnd nice to think there might be more on the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:33:53.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
