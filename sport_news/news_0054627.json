I wanted to get back on my bike to show what I was really made of. It gave me a whole new motivation.\"\nNibali, known as 'Il Squalo (The Shark)' for his incisive attacks, knuckled down and the results started pouring in.\nHe finished second in the Coppa Agostoni, won the Coppa Bernocchi and Trois Vallees Varesiennes, and finished third in the Pantani Memorial as he ramped up his preparations for another, and finally successful, tilt at victory on the Tour of Lombardy.\nSurprisingly, Nibali's victory on Sunday was the first by an Italian in a major classic since 2008, when Damiano Cunego won this same race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:39:04.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
