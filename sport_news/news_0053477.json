I think we have to focus on what we have to do as a club and what we have to do is win games.\" \nLosing Ryan is a big blow, but nobody is more frustrated than the captain himself. Tests have shown there is no muscle tear, but recovery is slow. Asked if he could have played this weekend if it had been a playoff game, Ryan was blunt. \n\"Not a chance,\" he said, stressing there are other options on the bench that would be more useful to the club than him playing at 80%. \nDos Santos doesn't want to risk not having Ryan ready for the post-season, even if that means not having him in the lineup for the final three regular season games. \n\"Now we're focusing on Richie (being ready) for the semi-final game,\" said the coach. \nEven if Ryan is fit for the season finale in Atlanta, Dos Santos may not want to risk playing him much on what many see as one of the league's worst playing surfaces. \n\"That's one of the (factors),\" Dos Santos said said. \nBECKIE GETTING JOB DONE \nIt's been a tough year for Drew Beckie. He lost his starting centre back spot to start the year when Fury brought in Colin Falvey and Rafael Alves and has been hobbled by a heel injury for the past couple months. But Beckie has taken on a more prominent role of late and was recently named to the NASL's Team of the Week, playing as a defensive midfielder. Though still somewhat hobbled by the foot injury, Beckie is happy to play wherever he's needed. \n\"It's always nice to play,\" Beckie said. \"Whenever I'm called on \"Â¦ it's my job to fill in wherever I'm needed. If I can do that to the best of my ability every time then I'm going to do it. \n\"I'm battling still through some injury but I'll work through it and whenever they need me I'm ready.\" \nBeckie said there's no risk of re-injuring his foot and it's just a matter of tolerating the discomfort. At this type of year, he said, players can tolerate a lot. \n\"You suck it up at this point in the season, for sure,\" he said. \nEUSTAQUIO BACK IN THE FOLD \nAfter leaving Fury to represent Canada in Olympic qualifiers, Mauro Eustaquio returned to Ottawa this week and will be available Sunday against San Antonio. Eustaquio and Canada's U-23 squad missed qualifying for the Rio Olympics with a 2-0 loss to the United States, but the 22-year-old midfielder plans to use the experience to his advantage as Fury pushes for a championship. \n\"Obviously our main goal was to qualify for the Olympics and unfortunately we didn't do it,\" Eustaquio said. \"The experience was great, being able to represent the country once again. Unfortunately we didn't reach our goal but you've got to take the good things out of this trip and move forward.\" \nPARTING SHOT \nLike many, Dos Santos isn't quite sure what has gone wrong for the defending Soccer Bowl champion San Antonio Scorpions. With a roster featuring plenty of skill, the team's fall down the table this season has surprised many. Dos Santos suggested Friday it was a lack of team unity. \n\"They were never a team,\" Dos Santos said. \"They're very good individuals, you look at their roster, excellent (players, but) they were never able to become a team, they didn't gel. \n\"When you look at all of that, you say how are they in the position they are?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:40:31.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
