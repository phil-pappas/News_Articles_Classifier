Paisley is playing free concerts at some of the biggest sporting events in the country, including at Virginia Tech and on College GameDay in Fort Worth.\nDuring his tour, Paisley made a stop at Baylor University to take part in the school's annual \"Traditions Rally\" in advance of the first home football game on Saturday against Lamar. Before the show, Baylor wide receivers KD Cannon and Kaleb Moore met Paisley and took to social media to let people know it.\n@BradPaisley pic.twitter.com/f9ZBAt5YBQ\n— KD Cannon (@IAmTheOne_9) September 12, 2015 Baylor meet @bradpaisley ðŸ¸ðŸ¶ #WhatupCoachB\nA photo posted by Kaleb Moore (@kaleb_moore) on Sep 11, 2015 at 2:45pm PDT\nIf you look in the background of Moore's picture, you may notice Baylor coach Art Briles. As expected, Brad Paisley hung out with Briles because if you come to Baylor, why wouldn't you hang out with Art Briles?\nThen on Friday night, Paisley took over Fountain Mall with around 10,000 raucous people in attendance. He made sure to share his experience on social media as well.\nYou @Baylor Bears were fantastic tonight! #CountryNationBaylor -TeamBP pic.twitter.com/K21W9rRqoO\n— Brad Paisley (@BradPaisley) September 12, 2015 On Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/7gYFIolZFJ/", "https://twitter.com/IAmTheOne_9/status/642514767995801601", "http://t.co/K21W9rRqoO", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountryNationBaylor?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah", "https://twitter.com/BradPaisley/status/642541687672147968", "https://twitter.com/Baylor", "https://twitter.com/BradPaisley", "http://t.co/f9ZBAt5YBQ"], "published": "2015-09-12T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:00:14.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
