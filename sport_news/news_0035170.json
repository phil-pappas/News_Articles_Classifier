Neither injury is serious as Noel has contusions on his left knee and back, while Okafor is resting a sore right knee. Still, their absences afforded quite an opportunity for rookie big men Christian Wood and Richaun Holmes.\nHolmes, who turns 23 on Thursday, stepped into the starting lineup and, though pounded by the bigger Robin Lopez at the defensive end, was very active and showed himself quite well. Wood, 20, the undrafted 6-11 forward out of UNLV also impressed. Holmes finished with six points and seven rebounds and Wood totaled 13 points and 10 boards in a 94-88 loss to the Knicks. The Sixers are now 2-2 in the preseason.\nIsaiah Canaan scored 18 points, but dealt no assists, to lead the Sixers, while Robert Covington had 11 points and JaKarr Sampson and Scottie Wilbekin each scored 10.\nMore coverage VOTE: Can the 76ers make the playoffs?

Buy 76ers jerseys, memorabilia, and other gear Latest Sixers videos Reserve Derrick Williams scored 21 points in 25 minutes to pace the Knicks, while Carmelo Anthony scored 18 and Saint Joseph's product Langston Galloway contributed 11.\nNew York played without rookie Kristaps Porzingis, who is nursing a quad injury. Taken fourth overall, one pick behind Okafor in this summer's draft, the 7-3 forward with the smooth outside stroke has scored 16 points combined in the Knicks' two preseason games while grabbing 12 rebounds. He's also made three of five three-pointers.\nCanaan and Wilbekin split the point-guard dutues and Brown said prior to the game that he wanted to get a chance to see Wilbekin play after giving T.J. McConnell the majority of the backup minutes lately. McConnell did not see any action last night.\nThe Sixers shot 4-for-18 in the fourth quarter and finished the game just 22-for-37 (59.5 percent) from the foul line. They also dealt just 12 assists on their 29 field goals.\nStill, it was more about seeing what the new youngsters may bring to the team.\n\"It's exciting, but my job is to get out there on the floor and play hard and do what I have to do to help the team win,\" said Holmes.\n\"I'm just learning something new every day. Trying to get better and picking up things from the last game and getting to the next game and get better every game. As I've played more, I've kind of got used to the speed and everything. I'm able to do more out on the court. It's definitely been a good learning experience.\"\nWood has opened Brown's eyes quite a bit during the preseason and training camp with his versatility and raw, untapped talent.\n\"How about young Christian Wood?\" said Brown. \"You look where he projected to go prior to the season (in the draft) and then he fell out come toward the end of the year, for whatever reason.\n\"They had projected him to be quite a high draft pick. I look at him and I see a bouncy, young athlete who can shoot. You have to look at something like that. I think he's 19 or 20 - we have a bunch of 20-year-olds on our team, as we all know. He just has sort of come out of leftfield and been on our roster and so lately you pay attention to that, mostly because of his physical gifts and his reputation.\n\"I think that (Holmes) has a weapon that we're going to grow on pick-and-pop stuff. I think he can shoot that three, but I feel like there's a toughness and there's a physicality that he doesn't back away from. He wants to go hit somebody. He wants to go try and block a shot. There's a quiet toughness in him and a physicality in him that I'm seeing more.\"\nInjury update It has been a week since Brett Brown announced that Nik Stauskas would be sidelined for two weeks with a stress reaction in his tibia. Brown said last night that Stauskas is on track and could be ready to go next week.\n\"I don't know what that means in regards to a specific day,\" he said of Stauskas. \"I believe it's next week. And Pierre (Jackson) is not that far away either. Pierre is expected to play in our next game. We have time off now.\"\nThe Sixers don't play again until Friday when they host the Washington Wizards. Both Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel are listed as day-to-day.\nBrown was also asked how many point guards he was looking to have on his Opening Day roster. As he said before, the answer was three. But he also said: \"I think Stauskas has something in him where he might be able to play a little bit of point. The three I said, I stand by, I think that's what you're going to see. But I think Stauskas, in a pinch, can be used there as well.\"\nBrothers battle There were quite a few minutes when Sixers forward Jerami Grant was on the floor with his older brother, Jerian, a rookie guard for the Knicks. Jerami scored six points for the Sixers while Jerian went for seven points and six assists.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNBA_Philadelphia_76ers"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:31:24.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
