Austin", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "FORT WORTH -- Trevone Boykin took the field midway through the first quarter with No. 3 TCU in a scoreless tie after lower-division Stephen F. Austin passed on a chance to take the lead because it didn't have its regular kicker.\nTwo long pass plays later, Boykin had the Horned Frogs in position for the first of five touchdowns in a span of about 10 minutes in a 70-7 victory over the Lumberjacks on Saturday.\nThe Heisman Trophy candidate, who finished with 285 yards passing and four touchdowns in a little more than a half, didn't change his demeanor to try to get the team going after the Lumberjacks came up short on fourth-and-goal from the TCU 10.\n\"I was like that from the start of the game,\" said Boykin, who led a 93-yard scoring drive to the game's first score. \"I felt like we should have scored on the first drive. But we didn't. We end up punting. When we came to the sideline, just told our guys to calm down, let's just play ball.\"\nThe Horned Frogs (2-0) won their 14th straight home opener under Gary Patterson since losing to Northwestern State of the FCS in his Amon Carter Stadium debut as head coach in 2001.\nThe Lumberjacks (0-2), facing the highest-ranked opponent in school history, dropped to 0-9 against Big 12 teams eight years after losing 67-7 in their only other meeting with the Frogs, the Big 12 co-champions who were in the Mountain West Conference then.\nKolby Listenbee had six catches for 142 yards, including a 51-yarder on a deep throw from Boykin that set up the first score â” one of two short touchdown runs by Aaron Green, who had all five of his carries for 20 yards in the first quarter.\nBoykin extended his nation-leading streak to 17 consecutive games with a touchdown pass on a 60-yarder to Listenbee, who caught the ball in stride on a deep crossing pattern and ran untouched to the end zone for a 21-0 lead late in the first quarter.\nComing off an uneven performance in 23-17 victory at Minnesota in the opener, Boykin was 18 of 27 with an interception that gave Stephen F. Austin another chance to score late in the second quarter. But the Lumberjacks went for it again on fourth down in field goal range trailing 35-0, and Zach Conque's pass was intercepted by Michael Downing.\nBoykin played one series in the second half, leaving after a 3-yard scoring pass to Emanuel Porter that put TCU up 42-0. Five plays later, Denzel Johnson returned an interception 50 yards for a score against Stephen F. Austin backup Hunter Taylor.\n\"I think he did what he needed to do,\" Patterson said of Boykin. \"I don't think he was inspired once you get up 21-0. So he knows. You've got to get to the next ballgame.\"\nConque had 11 completions, but for just 9 yards, and was sacked four times before leaving in the third quarter.\nA TCU defense missing two starters at linebacker and a pair of key linemen held the Lumberjacks to 167 total yards -- 75 of those coming on a touchdown run by Loren Easly early in the fourth quarter that avoided the shutout.\nThe Frogs finished with 627 total yards, including 112 yards passing and a touchdown from Bram Kohlhausen, Boykin's backup. The Frogs had 224 yards on the ground with 11 runners.\n\"Outmanned from the get-go,\" said Stephen F. Austin coach Clint Conque, the quarterback's dad. \"Knew it would be a tough day.\"\nThe other scoring passes for Boykin were 6 yards to KaVontae Turpin and 9 yards to Ja'Juan Story, both in the second quarter.\nMORE TCU-STEPHEN F.
