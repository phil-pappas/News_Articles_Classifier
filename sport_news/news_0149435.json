(AP) - Alex Collins rushed for 154 yards and two touchdowns Saturday as Arkansas defeated Tennessee 24-20 to snap a three-game skid and end its recent history of frustration in close games. The Razorbacks (2-3, 1-1 SEC) entered the night having lost their last 10 games decided by seven points or less, with nine of those defeats coming since Bret Bielema took over the program in 2013. Arkansas erased a 14-0 deficit and hung on despite wasting two second-half trips to the red zone on a blocked field goal and an unsuccessful fake field-goal attempt. Collins produced his third straight 150-yard game and put Arkansas ahead for good with a 1-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. Collins got help from Rawleigh Williams, who rushed for 100 yards. Jalen Hurd ran for 90 yards for Tennessee (2-3, 0-2), which lost by blowing a two-touchdown lead for the third time in four weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:47:15.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
