More From KTVZ.COM Mets, Cubs is most watched NLCS... \nThe Mariners were seeking a replacement for Lloyd McClendon, who was let go by new general manager Jerry Dipoto after the 2015 season. Dipoto was hired by the Mariners in late September after stepping down as Angels general manager earlier this year. \nServais, 48, and Dipoto shared a working relationship in Los Angeles, where Servais oversaw scouting and player development. \nServais doesn't have any experience as a manager, but he recently interviewed for the vacant San Diego Padres managerial position. He was a catcher in the majors from 1991-2001. \nThe Mariners also interviewed Tampa Bay Rays third base coach Charlie Montoyo, Red Sox special assistant Jason Varitek and minor league manager Phil Nevin.
