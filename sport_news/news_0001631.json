Comment Follow @@SDNRodrickA Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 11:00 AM Coming off a much needed win, the Vinton Lions will be looking to improve their power ranking with just three games remaining in the regular season. Vinton (2-5, 1-1) beat long-time rival DeQuincy last week. Today, they will head to Lake Arthur where the Tigers will be celebrating homecoming but the Lions look to spoil the fun. Vinton won the previous two meetings but Lake Arthur (4-3, 1-1) leads the all-time series 16-14 that dates back to 1959. “We were fortunate enough to get back into the win column and that was a big win for us on several different fronts,” Vinton head Tarius Davis said. “It kept us in pretty fare position with three weeks left in the season and maybe getting a decent draw in the playoffs. “When you get into district week in and week out they don’t get any easier. We have another tough ball game ahead of us with a physical football team that wants to run the football.” Stopping the 3-headed monster Last year, the Tigers relied on 2,000 yard rusher Trey Hargrave and full back Michael Ware who topped the 1,000 yard mark. This year they have added Trace Broussard to the mix. Broussard had 518 yards and four touchdowns, Hargrave leads the pack with 1,132 yards and 16 touchdowns while Ware had 425 yards and six scores. “Right now we are struggling a little bit defensively so it will be one of those games where we will have to find a way to get a few stops,” Davis said. “Of course everything revolves around Trey Hargrave. “He is the leader of that trio but they have Michael Ware who is a big, tough, physical runner who rushed for over a 1,000 yards as well last year. Then they have a Broussard kid this year. They have found a way to incorporate him into the mix.” Alma Mater While Davis may be a Lake Arthur alumi and one of the greatest football players to come out of that school, as the Lions head coach it is all about beating the Tigers. “I don’t have any hard feelings,” Davis said. “I always want to beat them. It is another tough opponent.” Back during his playing days, Davis lead the Tigers to wins over Vinton in 1993 (21-17) and 1994 (22-20). He had two touchdowns and picked off three passes in 1993 and accounted for all three touchdowns in 1994. The new Anfernee Dixon Anfernee Dixon left Vinton High School in the spring as the top wide receiver in schools history leaving a big hole, but sophomore Tony St. Julien has done a pretty fair job filling that hole. He has scored in every game this year and had 14 total touchdowns (5 rushing, 8 receiving, 1 kickoff). He currently has 17 catches for 561 yards and 578 rushing yards on 77 carries giving the Lions one of the most potent dual-threat athletes in the district. Page 2 of 2 - “Going into the season we could see that he had changed and turned the corner a little bit,” Davis said. “When the season started we were not looking for him to replace Anfernee Dixon but I guess with an athlete like him that expectation comes along. He has accepted more of that challenge offensively.” Blackout After experience electrical problems at their home stadium, the Vinton Lions don’t expect any more blackouts. Last weeks’ game had to be played on Saturday because some of the lights wouldn’t come on. Repairs have been made and the lights should be working properly when they host Welsh next week in their final regular season home game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:28:48.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
