With fewer specialties, limited resources and a higher level of poverty, the ranking measures of smaller hospitals often reflect the health challenges of the communities they serve. Larger hospitals tend to have higher scores due to a broader level and variety of specialty care.\n\"We have a strong focus on quality, which continues to be reflected in our outcomes. Our surgical site infection rate has remained at 0 percent for the past two year and healthcare associated infection rate is also at 0 percent, with prior year being .1 percent.\"\n(The AJC has been in contact with Turning Point, but has not received a comment about its rating.)\nAll hospitals were also ranked by patients who rated them on a 9 or 10, out of a scale of 1-10, and by patient experience on a five-star scale.\nClick here to see the AJC's database on metro Atlanta hospitals, including details on patient safety", "external_links": ["http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/956/Athens-Regional-Medical-Center", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/938/Memorial-Health-Univ-Medical-Cen-Inc", "https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/data/total-performance-scores.html", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/973/Medical-Center-Of-Central-Georgia", "http://hospitals.myajc.com/?ecmp=AJC_hospitaldata", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/932/Northeast-Georgia-Medical-Center-Inc", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/d/d/Georgia", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/962/Piedmont-Hospital", "http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/944/St-Joseph-s-Hospital-Savannah", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/923/Tanner-Medical-Center-Villa-Rica", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/959/Emory-University-Hospital-Midtown", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/921/Emory-University-Hospital", "http://hospitals.healthgrove.com/l/931/University-Hospital"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:00:45.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
