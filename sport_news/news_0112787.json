He’s one of the best in the majors at racing out into right field towards the foul line and calling for the catch in front of Jose Bautista.\nOnly in this situation, on this stage, with 40,357 hostile fans at Kauffman Stadium, he raised his gloved hand in the air to make the call, then thought he heard something and bailed out of the way, plunking down on the outfield grass as the baseball landed softly and safely between them.\n“I stuck my glove up, I thought I heard something but it wasn’t, so I didn’t go after it aggressive enough,” Goins said. “It dropped and that was it. It led to a big rally by them. I just thought I heard “I got it,” but it was nothing. I should have gone at it more aggressively, put my glove up like I always do, that means I got it and I just didn’t make the play.”\nAs good as Goins is at making that play look easy, Bautista confidently went into a trot as he approached, knowing that the first out of the inning would be recorded, with the Jays still leading 3-0. That would have left eight outs to go with left-hander David Price in control, working on a one-hitter, but all of a sudden that ball with nobody close to laying a glove on it, became a base hit that keyed a five-run rally, handing the lead to the Royals dominant bullpen, and eventually winning 6-3 . You can’t make mistakes like that.\n“The next hit’s a line drive probably where our first baseman would be if he’s playing back (not holding the runner),” Goins said. “It turned out to be a huge play and they just did a great job of rallying. That was kind of the turning point in the game. The blame should go on me today. I gave them that play to start that rally, so nothing can be said about it, but that’s a big play.”\nThe Jays looked in control. They had taken advantage of a fluke play in the sixth inning to build a three-run lead. Leading off, Josh Donaldson popped a 2-1 pitch from Yordano Ventura over near the Royals dugout. As catcher Sal Perez camped under it, the ball glanced off a cable supporting the backstop. Perez grabbed it with a bare hand, but umpire Laz Diaz made the call of no-play.\nDonaldson then singled and the Jays went on to add two runs to a 1-0 lead. The second run of the frame came in on a Troy Tulowitzki double, but they left the bases loaded when the Royals brought in reliever Luke Hochevar. An inning later came the Goins gaffe. Devastating.\n“You feel for the guy,” Tulowitzki said. “Obviously you’re going to be shaken up. That’s why you have good people around you, or at least you try to. You don’t want to see that happen to anybody. (Goins) is a heck of a player, a good defensive player, the crowd was loud and somehow the ball dropped. But just because one guy gets on it doesn’t mean those runs have to score. There’s still pitches after that and plays to be made after that, so this doesn’t fall on (Goins) at all.”\nThe pointed question for manager John Gibbons became, with the inning unravelling, why was the bullpen not up with someone warming to come in and stem the tide. If the five-run Royals rally proved one thing, it proved how much Gibbons misses the presence of left-hander Brett Cecil and his ability to come in and shut down opponents, both left-handers and right-handers.\nGibbons is left with a small circle of trust in his ’pen. The list of names he would bring into situations like that includes Aaron Sanchez and Roberto Osuna and, maybe, Mark Lowe — but this was the seventh inning and that would have been for Cecil. So Price stayed in to battle.\n“In those at-bats after throwing so many pitches, he probably left a couple of pitches over the plate, but it wasn’t like anything changed in his stuff,” catcher Russell Martin said. “It was still good. A couple of balls off the end of the bat in big situations and the rest is history.”\nThis Jays team found itself in a much tougher position in the previous playoff series. They lost the first two games at home, and were then faced with winning three in a row to advance. This time they are going to the Rogers Centre for three where it’s the Royals battling the crowd noise.\n“We’ve been down 2-0 before,” Tulowitzki said. “It’s still a tough loss to come here and at least want a split. It looked like the game was right there for us. Unfortunately it got away. It’s not a place that we want to be, but hey, we’re faced with it. This team is tough and I’m sure we’ll battle back.”\nMore on thestar.com\nJohn Tory does a bat flip over bet with Kansas City mayor\nBlue ‘Toronto’ sign, bigger TV at Nathan Phillips Square for Jays game", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:25:42.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
