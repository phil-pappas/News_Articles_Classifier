Wright was nursing an ankle injury and left the game after two carries. \nIt didn’t matter. Gavin Hobbs, Kobe Schulze and Max Stoltz all ran for over 80 yards to pick up the slack. \n“Max ran the ball well again, Hobbs stepped up for us and we did some things we’ve done a little bit of, but a lot moreof the jet plays with Kobe and (Tyler) Ihle,” Ballard head coach Al Christian said. “That opened things up so Max and Hobbs could run up inside.” \nHobbs ran for 116 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries, filling in for Wright. Stoltz added 84 yards and three touchdown runs on on 11 carries and he also completed 4 of 9 passes for 41 yards and one touchdown with no interceptions to help Ballard earn its third-straight impressive victory since a 27-26 homecoming loss to Carlisle on Sept. 25. \n“The biggest thing is focus and effort,” Stoltz said. “Earlier this week, the big thing was the offensive line. We needed to focus on how we’re going to get a block. Then the effort was just from everybody. Everybody has got to be in the zone and giving 100 percent or it doesn’t click.” \nKobe Schulze gave Ballard a big weapon on the edge. He ran 10 times for 84 yards and one touchdown. \n“It felt nice,” Schulze said. “It felt like Hunter needed me out there, and I went out there and showed them how he does it. It’s another threat getting the ball to receivers on jet sweeps.” \nAustin Edwards caught three passes for 33 yards and one touchdown. \nThe Bomber defense was awesome up front. The Ballard front seven held Nevada to few gains of positive yards on the ground and the Bombers racked up eight sacks. \n“We filled in the middle hard and we knew they were a 60-percent passing team, so we worked on that a lot throughout the week,” Ballard linebacker Seth Moore said. “That was super fun. We got to blitz and we got a bunch of sacks, so it was a good game for us.” \nMoore had seven tackles and one sack. Wyatt Terrones and Easton Moody both recorded nine tackles and three sacks, Cade Wilson picked up seven tackles, Kaleb Odden chipped in six tackles and one sack and Max Moulden delivered 3.5 stops and one sack. \n“They’ve got some good players,” Nevada head coach Kody Asmus said. “Number 50 (Moore) and 41 (Wilson) are as good of linebackers that I’ve seen in high school football and 56 (Moody) is a good d-lineman. They’ve got a lot of other guys also that are good players, but those three really stuck out to me on field and they were as good as advertised.” \nNevada dropped to 2-6 overall and 0-5 in 3A District 6. \nThe Cubs’ best stretch came at the beginning of the second half. They recovered an onside kick and then Macade Matuska connected with Peyton Sharp on a 32-yard touchdown pass. \nMatuska completed 12 of 26 passes for 146 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. Sharp made three grabs for 53 yards and ran for 21 yards, Omunique Wilkerson had three catches for 31 yards and Joseph Heintz made two grabs for 29 yards for Nevada. \nTrent Stahl made eight tackles, Bennett Thompson had 6.5 stops and Lane Hillock chipped in five tackles plus a fumble recovery for Nevada on defense. Salvador Garcia also recovered a fumble for the Cubs. \nBallard will host Grinnell (4-4, 2-3) in its final regular season game next Friday in Huxley. The game will start at 7:30 p.m. at Rich Strouse Field. \nBallard 47, Nevada 7 \nB 14 13 20 0 - 47 \nN 0 0 7 0 - 7 \nScoring \nB - Kobe Schulze 3 run (Charlie Rietz kick), 7:04 \nB - Gavin Hobbs 7 run (Rietz kick), 0:49.8 \nSecond quarter \nB - Max Stoltz 5 run (kick failed), 3:55 \nB - Stoltz 15 run (Rietz kick), 1:13 \nThird quarter \nN - Peyton Sharp 32 pass from Macade Matuska (Parker Walden kick), 10:18 \nB - Stoltz 1 run (Rietz kick), 6:49 \nB - Hobbs 22 run (C.J.
