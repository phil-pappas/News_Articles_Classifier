Rachel Estopare got the start again in goal and made five more saves. The Cardinal did what they do best and finished with nine corner kicks to Arizonaâ€™s two. \nArizona broke the seal in the 21st minute with a Jaden DeGracie goal. Paige Crouch collected the ball off a rebound and fired one towards the cage. The ball happened to go right to DeGracie and she back heeled it into the goal, making the score 1-0 Arizona. \nJust two minutes later, Haley Rosen equalized for the Cardinal off an assist from Laura Liedle. She received the ball and took one touch and fired a shot from about 30 yards away. The ball made it past Estopare and hit the back of the net. \nIn the 31st minute, Stanford took the lead after Andi Sullivan scored one of the best goals you will see all season in college soccer. She took a shot from over 30 yards out and it kissed the left post and went into the goal, giving Estopare no chance at making a save. \nHalftime came and went, and then Arizona equalized in the 71st minute. \nStoian received the ball about 50 yards away from the goal and started dribbling up field. A Stanford defender finally challenged her about 25 yards out and Stoian made her miss and she had a good chance to shoot. She took the shot and placed it into the left corner of the goal, making the score 2-2. \nStoian now has six goals this season and 19 for her career. \nTwo minutes into the second half of extra time, Stanford played a ball into the goal box and neither team could really corral it. After a scrum for a few seconds, Kyra Carusa was able to get a foot on it and scored, effectively ending the game by a score of 3-2. \nArizona heads to Los Angeles, Calif. next weekend to take on UCLA on Fri. Oct. 9 at 7 p.m. PT and USC on Sun. Oct. 11 at 3:30 p.m. on the Pac-12 Networks. \nCopyright 2015 Arizona Athletics. All rights reserved.
