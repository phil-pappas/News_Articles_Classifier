When she returned home her parents noticed she was unwell, she then began fitting and foaming at the mouth, and her voice deepened into a raspy tone.\nThe girl, from Lima, Peru, was taken to hospital, where medics said she was extremely strong, making it difficult for them to control her. In the creepy footage she can be heard screaming ‘666’ in a deep rasping voice, followed by ‘let me go, let me go’.\nIt took medics half an hour to restrain her. She was then transferred to a psychiatric ward so doctors could work out what was wrong with her.\nAccording to local media , people who witnessed the incident were convinced she was possessed by satanic spirits.\nWell that’s terrifying.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/horrifying-moment-girl-possessed-devil-6582565#rlabs=3%20rt$sitewide%20p$3", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RT7dK9fPosQ", "http://www.americatv.com.pe/noticias/actualidad/adolescente-que-jugo-ouija-fue-internada-convulsiones-chosica-n200827"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:16:20.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
