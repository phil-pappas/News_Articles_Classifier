Tonight's winner should find itself in a Beach District tie with Ocean Lakes (4-0). The Marlins have won five of the past six meetings against Cox, but the Falcons won 44-25 last season. Kickoff is at 7 tonight. The teams\nCox (4-0): Quarterback Cole Johnson has been instrumental in guiding the Falcons, passing for 695 yards and seven touchdowns while completing more than 50 percent of his passes. More importantly, he's only thrown one interception. His favorite target has been Jake Wallace (12 receptions, 142 yards, two touchdowns). Johnson also is a threat to take off under pressure, rushing 40 times for 167 yards and four more scores. He has a host of running backs to work with, but Matt DeMasi (42 carries, 216 yards, three TDs) has been the most effective.\nBayside (4-0): The Marlins have been deadly through the air, with QB Donte Lampley throwing for 893 yards and 11 scores on 60-of-110 passing with three INTs. His favorite target so far has been Phillip Patterson (17 catches, 302 yards, four TDs). Should conditions prevent the Marlins from passing, Lampley is a capable runner and the Marlins have run nine backs this season.\nWhat you need to know\nDepending on how windy and rainy it is, Bayside could have to steer away from an aerial attack and depend on the run. South Carolina State-bound quarterback Lampley is capable of using his feet and the Marlins have a slew of running backs to depend on.\nThe Marlins could still depend on some short passes to get the ball into the hands of the Virginia Tech-bound Patterson.\nDefensively, they'll have their hands full with Johnson, a James Madison commit who plays very smart.\n\"That's the main thing we're emphasizing,\" Bayside coach Jonathan White said. \"He's a great player and is very businesslike. He's going to handle whatever we throw at him.\"\nCox coach Bill Stachelski says the Falcons will still have to respect Bayside's passing despite the weather. \"They like to spread the field and their quarterback can run,\" he said.\nWho will win\nLarry Rubama says: The Marlins find a way to pull this one out. Bayside, 26-23.\nJami Frankenberry says: Running game and Johnson's elusiveness win out in a mucky mess. Cox, 27-21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:17:39.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
