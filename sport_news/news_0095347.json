The Bears (2-3) will visit the reeling Lions (0-5) on Sunday as underdogs for the sixth time in six games this season. The Lions, who have won four straight in the series, are favored by three.\nPerhaps Bears coaches prefer the outside doubt. They spent the week preaching how the Lions aren't as bad as their record indicates.\nHere's our snapshot of Sunday's game:\nPlayer in spotlight\nSecond-year inside linebacker Christian Jones will call the defense, and the Bears expect that process to go smoother than it did a week ago.\nThe defense had operational problems after inside linebacker Shea McClellin sprained his left knee against the Chiefs. He was the signal caller and had the helmet headset through which coordinator Vic Fangio radios the play call. McClellin, who's not expected to play against the Lions, also was charged with making pre-snap adjustments after seeing the offensive formation.\nJones took over those responsibilities, and it was rough going at first.\n\"You have to be ready when somebody goes down, and it kind of caught me off guard a little bit,\" Jones said.\nWhat was the problem?\n\"Everybody has to get the call,\" he said. \"Everybody has to be on the same page. If one guy doesn't get the call, it's on me. Just make sure I keep saying the call until everybody gets it.\"\nKeep an eye on\nRookie center Hroniss Grasu expects to move up the learning curve in his second NFL start. The difference between the speed of Sunday's game with the Chiefs and exhibition games didn't require much of an adjustment for him.\n\"I liked it a lot more, to be honest with you,\" he said. \"I felt really comfortable. Just playing fast — that's all I have to do.\"\nAs Grasu's debut progressed, he developed a better feel for the leverage required to block linemen Jaye Howard and Dontari Poe. He expects that to help him from the start of Sunday's game.\nGrasu caught a break with Friday's news that defensive tackle Haloti Ngata (calf) will sit out. Ngata's size and power would have presented a huge challenge in the running game. Perhaps Bears linemen can climb to the second level more easily now that fourth-round draft pick Gabe Wright is expected to start instead.\nPressing question\nCan the Bears continue Matthew Stafford's misery?\nThe first-overall pick in the 2009 draft was benched Sunday for the first time in his career. After throwing two first-half interceptions, coach Jim Caldwell warned him at halftime that he would be sidelined if he threw another. Sure enough, Stafford did on the Lions' first possession of the third quarter.\n\"One of the things you know about him … he's a tough-minded guy,\" Caldwell told media in Chicago on a teleconference Wednesday. \"And he's back on pace and working hard like you would anticipate.\"\nStafford leads the NFL with eight interceptions, for which there have been a variety of causes, including inaccurate throws, poor pass protection and holding the ball too long.\nHow can the Bears send Stafford further down the spiral?\nSaid defensive end Jarvis Jenkins: \"The main thing is stopping that run, try to make them one-dimensional and get after the quarterback.\"\nInjury report\nThe Bears listed four players as doubtful for the game: McClellin, safety Antrel Rolle (right ankle), defensive lineman Ego Ferguson (knee) and cornerback Terrance Mitchell (hamstring).\nWith McClellin down, rookie linebacker Jonathan Anderson is expected to make his NFL debut and even could be in the starting lineup. He was promoted from the practice squad Wednesday.\nHow has he progressed since the preseason without participating in any games?\n\"Just understanding the concepts of the defense more,\" said Anderson, who added he's comfortable in pass coverage.\nNine are listed as questionable: tight end Martellus Bennett (quadriceps); receivers Alshon Jeffery (hamstring), Eddie Royal (ankle) and Josh Bellamy (groin); left tackle Jermon Bushrod (shoulder); guard Patrick Omameh (ankle); linebacker Pernell McPhee (shoulder); and defensive linemen Jeremiah Ratliff (left ankle) and Will Sutton (left elbow/biceps).\nSutton is likely to play Sunday for the first time since Week 3.\nThe Lions are dealing with key injuries as well. In addition to Ngata, tight end Eric Ebron (left knee) and linebacker DeAndre Levy (hip) are out.\nRunning back Theo Riddick (groin), the Lions' most effective back in their hurry-up offense, missed Friday's practice.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Bears Detroit Lions Shea McClellin Matthew Stafford NFL Vic Fangio Kansas City Chiefs", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56219d80/turbine/ct-huddle-up-christian-jones-bears-spt-1017-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:25:24.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
