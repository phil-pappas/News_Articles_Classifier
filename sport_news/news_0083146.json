While it worked — Tejada couldn’t turn the double play, and the game was tied — the takeout was extra painful to the Mets and Tejada, who wound up with a broken leg.\nThe game, up until then in the Mets’ command, turned abruptly, with the Dodgers eventually stealing a 5-2 win to knot the series at 1-1.\nAs of Sunday afternoon, about 4,400 fans had channeled their rage into Internet signatures encouraging the baseball commissioner to suspend the “hard nosed” or “dirty” player (depending upon which team you root for).\n“Any fan of baseball is in a riot right now as they know this wasn’t not a slide it was a straight up takeout of Tejeda,” the petition reads about the longtime Phillie. “Utley is known as a player who would do this as he has had MANY altercations in the past of the same thing. MLB is this a way to teach young players, little leaguers on how the game is played. I wonder how parents think about this play and their kids playing. MLB you already have a rule to remove catcher interference why is this OK? MLB, based on what I stated and what the majority of fans say, please strongly consider suspending Utley.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:30:21.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
