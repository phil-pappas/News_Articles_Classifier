Posted: Sunday, October 4, 2015 6:11 pm Colts Report Card: Week 4 By George Bremer | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 4, 2015 \nGRADES \nOffense: C \n40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck, the oldest quarterback in the NFL, produced the best game by a Colts passer so far this year, completing 30 of 47 attempts for 282 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. But fumbles by Josh Robinson and Frank Gore helped set the offense back, and the running game gained just 60 yards on 24 carries. Tight end Coby Fleener came up big with nine catches for 83 yards, including a 28-yarder to help set up the winning field goal. \nDefense: C \nThe Colts allowed Blake Bortles to throw for 298 yards and gave up 105 rushing yards to rookie T.J. Yeldon. But Indy surrendered just a single touchdown drive, and that came on a short field following Robinson's fumble. The Jaguars' eight possessions in the second half and overtime yielded six punts and two missed field goals. It was bend-but-don't-break at its finest, with an assist from a struggling Jacksonville kicker along the way. \nSpecial Teams: A \nPat McAfee consistently flipped the field with a 45-yard net punting average, dropping two inside the 20-yard line, and Griff Whalen averaged 30 yards on two kickoff returns. Then, of course, there were Adam Vinatieri's three field goals, the last of which won the game from 27 yards out with 3:37 to play in the extra period. \nPLAYER OF THE GAME \nColts K Adam Vinatieri Indianapolis Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri reacts after kicking a 54-yard field goal during the first half against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. Michael Conroy | The Associated Press \nThe superlatives came raining in for the 41-year-old kicker. He became the Colts all-time leading scorer with a 54-yard field goal to open the scoring in the first quarter, and he became the first player in league history to score 1,000 points with two separate teams with a 32-yarder to tie the game in the fourth. Vinatieri capped his big day with a 27-yarder in overtime for the win. He tied a league record with his ninth field goal in OT, and it was the 25th game-winner of his soon to be Hall of Fame career.
