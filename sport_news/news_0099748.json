Each team has won on its home field.Worth noting: UConn goes on the road for the second straight week and third time in four weeks. By the time the Huskies return tonight, they will have traveled 8,240 roundtrip air miles already this season ... Central Florida quarterback Justin Holman, who missed most of the last four games with an injury, returns today ... The losing team in each of the first two meetings committed four turnovers ... UConn has recorded seven sacks but it has given up 16 ... The Knights began the season without a receiver who had recorded a collegiate reception in his career ... The Knights own an all-time record of 27-5 in league home games. That goes back to 2005 when they joined Conference USA.Scouting reportUConn will win if: It can score. Central Florida has given up a lot of yardage and a lot of points, allowing foes to score 27.6 points per game. The problem is, the UConn offense has had the same old scoring troubles this year that have plagued it in the past. UConn has busted the 20-point mark only once this year. It has to find a way to put the ball in the end zone and finish drives.UCF will win if: It, too, can score. These two offenses are among the worst in the country. In fact, the Knights' offense is ranked dead last in the FBS. They average about 40 fewer yards per game than UConn and score just .4 points more than UConn on average. Games typically come down to defense. This one will come down to which offense can actually do something. It probably won't be an offensive show.Key matchupsUConn OL vs. UCF DL: Always on this matchup. The offensive line is key and has had some recurring problems.UConn QB Bryant Shirreffs vs. UCF D: Central Florida has had trouble stopping the passing game. Shirreffs has to take advantage of that.UCF offense vs. itself: The Knights already have an alarming 13 turnovers and have forced just four.UConn UCF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:36:44.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
