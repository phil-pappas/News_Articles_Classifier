Inman, Contributing Writer; Image: Michigan State WR Aaron Burbridge scores touchdown against Air Force. (Image Source: Al Goldis/AP Photo) \nBig Ten Week 5 preview: \nPurdue at (2) Michigan State – Noon on ESPN2 \nAfter a successful (if not entirely overwhelming) non-conference campaign, the second-ranked Michigan State Spartans (4-0) open up B1G play by hosting the Purdue Boilermakers (1-3). Michigan State defeated Oregon in the second week of the season and then knocked off Air Force and Central Michigan in somewhat underwhelming victories. The Spartans have the 19 th -ranked offense and 26 th -ranked defense and they don’t appear to have a definite weak spot. Connor Cook has been efficient and the emergence of Aaron Burbridge as a big-play threat has been a boon for the offense. The biggest area of concern for MSU would be the secondary, where they have some injury concerns and just gave up a lot of passing yards to Central Michigan’s Cooper Rush . I don’t believe Michigan State is actually the second best team in the country but they have earned their spot in the Top 10 and are a very good squad. \nTheir opponent on Saturday, the Purdue Boilermakers, cannot say the same thing. The Boilers lost to Marshall, Virginia Tech and Bowling Green (two of those at home) and are still looking for their first victory over an FBS team. Purdue switched to quarterback David Blough prior to the Bowling Green game and he played quite well against the Falcons. However, the defense was shredded by Matt Johnson and Purdue failed to take advantage of BGSU mistakes. More concerning is that the running game was unable to produce against a porous and weak run defense. They’ll need DJ Knox and Markell Jones to have much better days on Saturday to avoid getting waxed in East Lansing. MSU is a three-touchdown favorite for this one and it’s hard to envision Purdue making this one interesting for more than a half or so. \nIowa at Wisconsin – Noon on ESPN \nThrough four weeks, the Iowa Hawkeyes have surprised me more than any team in the country. Their offense has been surprisingly open and effective and their defense is a borderline top-25 unit. They manhandled Illinois State in the opener, won at Iowa State, beat Pittsburgh at home and then slaughtered North Texas in week four. Iowa has been very good at finishing drives and the play of CJ Beathard has more than justified the decision by Kirk Ferentz to name him the starter late in 2014. \nWisconsin has rebounded from their opening week loss to Alabama by handling three inferior opponents with ease. Their running game finally got rolling last week after three weeks of subpar work on the ground but it’s the defense that has been the star for the Badgers so far. Wisconsin’s defense is giving up only 9.5 points per game, good for fourth in the country Corey Clement remains out so it will be Taiwan Deal getting the bulk of the carries on Saturday. Iowa will likely load up and force Joel Stave to try and beat a talented secondary. This B1G West battle figures to be a tightly played game that is decided by the narrowest of margins. I think Jordan Canzeri and LeShun Daniels are able to have decent days for the Hawkeyes and I expect Iowa to hit a big play or two to a receiver like Matt VandeBerg or Tevaun Smith . Wisconsin has a very good defense but they haven’t played an offense with a pulse since week one while Iowa has been tested by a pair of Power 5 teams in Iowa State and Pittsburgh. \nTo Read More From Sammy Jacobs, TJ Inman & Nick Holmes of HoosierHuddle.com , click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:16:16.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
