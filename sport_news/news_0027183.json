(AP) - Federal investigators are back at work probing the derailment of a Washington, D.C.-bound Amtrak train that derailed after hitting rocks in Vermont, sending two cars down an embankment and injuring seven people.\nOne of the victims, a crew member, was seriously hurt and airlifted to a hospital.\nThe Vermonter, carrying 98 passengers and four crew members, had been on the tracks for about 90 minutes when it hit rocks that had fallen from a ledge onto the tracks in Northfield, about 20 miles southwest of Montpelier at around 10:30 a.m. Monday.\nThe locomotive and one of the passenger coaches tumbled down an embankment. Three passenger cars left the tracks but remained upright.\n\"This was a freak of nature,\" Gov. Peter Shumlin said.\nOne of the injured people was airlifted to a New Hampshire hospital. Six others went to a local hospital with injuries including neck, back and shoulder pains and lightheadedness.\nAmtrak said a crew member was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries but four other people were released by Monday evening.\nInvestigators from the Federal Railroad Administration and National Transportation Safety Board arrived on the scene Monday afternoon.\nPassenger Bob Redmond, of Bay City, Michigan, was taking a foliage tour when the train derailed. He looked outside the window and saw the car that had been ahead of his was now alongside him.\n\"It was just going the other way, and we started tipping sideways and down we went,\" he said.\nFederal records show two companies that have operated that stretch of track have had four accidents since 2006 that could have involved debris on the tracks.\nFederal safety rules for tracks that carry passengers require at least two inspections every week, with at least one day between inspections. State officials said a freight train had passed over the tracks Sunday night with no problems.\nNumerous derailments around the world have been caused by debris on tracks, many linked to heavy rains that trigger slides. In 2010, a train in Beijing hit mounds of debris left on the track following a landslide, killing 19 people.\nThe region near Monday's derailment received 2.5 inches of rain between Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service said.\nAmtrak planned to bus passengers booked on the Vermonter to and from Springfield.\nAssociated Press writer Joan Lowy contributed to this report from Washington, D.C.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
