Charlie Baker criticized what he considers a blase attitude among some health professionals about addic­tive painkillers as he intro­duced legislation Thursday as part of his strategy to curtail a deadly surge in drug overdoses in Massa­chusetts. \nBaker called for a 72- hour limit on first-time prescriptions for opioid painkillers and a change in the state's civil commit­ment law. \nThe legislation would restrict patients to a three-day supply of painkillers the first time they are prescribed an opioid drug, or when they receive a prescription from a new doctor. Patients could seek refills after the three-day period and exceptions would be made for certain chronic conditions and hospice care. \nThe governor has been highly critical of overpre­scribing painkillers, which can lead to addiction to opioids, including heroin. \nMAINE \nConcealed carry law takes effect \nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) - Legal gun owners in Maine no longer need a permit to carry a concealed handgun. \nThe new rules took effect Thursday.

No one can bring a gun to places including courthouses, state parks, schools, federal buildings and on private property when prohibited by the property owner.
