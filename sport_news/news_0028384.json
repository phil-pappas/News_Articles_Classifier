Vista Grande rolls to win over Desert View By MARC DAVID, For the Dispatch Casa Grande Valley Newspapers Inc. CASA GRANDE — When Sarah Barker took her turn to serve in the third game, Vista Grande trailed by seven. The Spartans were down but hardly out. With Barker serving two aces and Jaysie Hall-Williams getting two kills, Vista Grande reeled off 10 straight points to turn the game around and complete a 25-15, 25-23, 25-22 sweep of visiting Desert View in a Division III/Section 3 contest on Thursday night. “Sarah served phenomenal,” Vista Grande coach Kiki Wilson said. “I was especially happy that we were able to come back in the third game.” Wilson was pleased with the improvement shown by the Spartans (2-7, 1-0). While Vista Grande had difficulties with the Jaguars’ serving at the start of the match, the Spartans made the necessary adjustments and overcame an early 7-2 deficit. Four players combined for six Desert View aces in the first game. The Jaguars (1-9, 0-3) served well for much of the match, with Arlett Arreola getting seven aces to augment her six kills and three blocks. Amanda Ortiz had three straight aces during Desert View’s early run. Vista Grande was even better with its serving in the first game. Barker had the first two of her five aces in the game. And Marcina Garcia, who matched Barker with five aces, matched Ortiz’s total of three straight midway through the game. With the first game tied at 11-11, Hall-Williams served two aces during a four-point run that put VG ahead to stay. Barker’s kill closed out the game. The Spartans got off to a fast start in the second game, racing in front 11-2. And then Arreola did it all during a five-point run that included four service winners and a kill as the Jaguars clawed back into the game at 11-7. With Arreola and Josie Lewandowski strong at the net and Melissa Navarro (10 assists) passing well, Desert View kept it close until the end when an ace by Yara Vasquez provided Vista Grande with the winning point. The Jaguars dominated much of the third game, twice building leads of seven. Two aces by Arreola made it 21-14 before the Spartans staged their impressive comeback behind Barker’s serving. Barker finished with 16 service points. Garcia and Hall-Williams had six kills apiece, Ashley Morton had 10 assists and Ayliny Patino had 11 digs. “We worked a lot on our serving and passing,” Wilson said. “I was happy to see that the stuff we worked on (in practice) we seemed to do a whole lot better tonight. We stressed to the girls about fighting to the last point. Now I think they understand what it means to work hard to get those last few points.” While the overall record is not good, the Spartans picked up their game just in time for section play. “I am definitely happy with the way things worked out,” Wilson said. “The energy level was much better than it had been in some of our other matches.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:41:11.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
