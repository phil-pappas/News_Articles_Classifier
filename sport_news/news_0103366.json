Every day I’m improving,” Rose said. “The eye itself, the swelling is going down, so just taking my time. Practice has been going well. Been practicing pretty hard, and if everything is all right (Friday), I’m going to play a little bit.\"\nPreviously, the Bulls said Rose most likely would miss all eight exhibitions when his return from breaking his left orbital bone in the first practice of the season on Sept. 29 got slowed because of persistent swelling. Rose still sported swelling on Thursday and said he still occasionally experiences double vision. But he also extolled the virtues of playing.\n\"They just want me out there,” Rose said. “As long as I'm out there and moving around, I'm not worried about attacking or being aggressive. That's going to come. I just need to be out there.\"\nRose also didn’t rule out playing in the season opener on Oct. 27 against the Cavaliers.\n\"Opening night is opening night,\" he said. \"It’s when the season starts, so it’s your showcase to show everybody what you been doing the entire summer. So it’s a big night, but at the same time if I feel like I can’t go there’s no point in rushing it or pushing myself.\"\nCoach Fred Hoiberg said the Bulls would again start Pau Gasol, Nikola Mirotic, Tony Snell, Jimmy Butler and Kirk Hinrich on Friday. He also said there’s a “pretty good chance” that would be the starting unit for the opener, with Rose obviously replacing Hinrich if he can go.\nJoakim Noah said a bench role would be an adjustment for him.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Derrick Rose Chicago Bulls Kirk Hinrich", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562926da/turbine/ct-derrick-rose-cleared-contact-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:22:20.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
