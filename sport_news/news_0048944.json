Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports (Eric Hartline) Comments \nPHILADELPHIA -- Eagles second-year receiver Josh Huff is coming off of the best game of his career , catching five passes for 78 yards and a touchdown against the New Orleans Saints. \nThis Monday night, Huff is hoping to have another strong showing -- and it seems like he is confident he can make it happen. \nSpeaking at his locker, Huff gave his assessment of the New York Giants' secondary, which the Eagles will face this Monday in a must-win game at Lincoln Financial Field . \nAlthough he had some praise for Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Huff also pointed out a flaw he sees in the cornerback's game. \n\"If he is locked in once he gets going, once the game starts, he is pretty much one of the better corners in the league,\" Huff said. \"But he takes some plays off, and when he takes some of those plays off, I'm going to try to bring it to him and let him know it's going to be a long day for him.\" \nHuff also had a brutally honest assessment of rookie Landon Collins , the Giants' first-round pick who has started five games for the Giants. \n\"I know they have a rookie in the backend at safety. He is a down in the box guy. Not a real good cover guy with man,\" Huff said. \"But he can come down and hit, tackle very well. They all, at sometimes, get lost in coverage, I would say. But they are very fundamentally strong.\" BRADFORD: Report card from win over Saints \nThe secondary has been an issue for the Giants this season, as they are currently dead last against the pass in the NFL, giving up an average of 304.2 yards per game. \nIf Huff is correct in his assessment, and the Eagles are able to take advantage of a Rodgers-Cromartie or Collins, quarterback Sam Bradford and the team's passing attack could be in for a big night. \nThe Eagles are already coming off of their best offensive showing of the season, putting up 39 points and 519 yards of total offense. \nBeing able to duplicate that showing on Monday night would be huge, considering it is very possible that the winner will end up in first place in the NFC East heading into Week 7. \nWhether they can do it remains to be seen, but listening to Huff, at least one member of the offense seems confident they can.
