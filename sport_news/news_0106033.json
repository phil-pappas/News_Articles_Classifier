He finished 13-of-24 for 110 yards and an interception. Backup Thomas Sydeski went 7-of-15 for 77 yards in relief. \nThe Statesmen (4-2, 2-1) totaled just 24 yards on the ground and lost the time of possession battle 36:17 to 23:43. \nTommy D’Antonio notched the lone touchdown for Hobart on a 72-yard fumble return late in the first quarter. Kicker Sean Kirshe connected on field goals of 21 and 28 yards in the second quarter for a 13-0 halftime lead. \nSpringfield (4-2, 2-1) went ahead with a 14-point third quarter that included Billy DeLay’s 20-yard rushing touchdown and Steve Comee’s offensive fumble recovery in the end zone that capped a 15-play, 80-yard drive, taking 8:50 off the clock. \nJake Eglintine began a 21-point fourth quarter with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Joe Festo. \nTrayvon Toney piled up 13 tackles on defense for the Statesmen, who are idle next weekend. Marcus Jemison was right behind with 12 stops. James Hedger added a sack while Michael Harper had two tackles for a loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:29:29.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
