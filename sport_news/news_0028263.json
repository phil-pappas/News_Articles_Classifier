Quarterback Ethan O'riley completed a 46-yard pass to Floyd, O'riley's only completion of the game, to put Hot Springs at the Magnolia 7. Two plays later, Floyd scored from the 3 for a 7-0 lead. \nHot Springs Coach Chris Vereen said the return of Floyd helped the Trojans get moving. \n\"He came back last week about 60, 65 percent, and he's still not 100 percent,\" Vereen said, \"but when we have him on the field, things tend to go a lot smoother offensively.\" \nThe Trojans had 355 total yards, with 309 coming on the ground. Hot Springs held Magnolia to 68 yards rushing and 124 total yards. \n\"We tried to keep our defense off the field, but couldn't,\" Magnolia Coach John Panter said. \"They do an excellent job running the ball.\" \nHot Springs pushed the lead to 14-0 in the second quarter when O'riley found a crease and raced 46 yards to cap a 6-play, 77-yard drive. \nKayvon Ward's 1-yard run completed a 9-play, 65-yard drive for Hot Springs, completing the scoring. \nHot Springs ran 54 plays (51 rushing, 3 passes) to the Panthers' 43 plays (24 rushing, 19 passing) and held a 26:42-21:18 advantage in time of possession. Magnolia punted on six of its eight possessions with the other two ending on downs at the Trojans' 38 and 45. \n\"We're not a big-play offense; we just try to keep the sticks moving,\" Vereen said. \"The other side has a tendency to get frustrated when they don't get the ball. They try to make something happen quick, and all of a sudden they get in a hole.\" \nWard finished with 96 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries, while O'riley carried 10 times for 88 yards and a touchdown. \nWATSON CHAPEL 42, WHITE HALL 7 \nPINE BLUFF — Trey Woods and Trey Cole each scored twice as Watson Chapel (3-4, 3-1 5A-South) defeated White Hall (0-7, 0-4). Jakobi Wilson passed for two touchdowns. Woods opened the scoring with a 44-yard run in the first quarter. Jackson passed to Isaiah Jones for a 63-yard touchdown, and Cole added a 2-yard touchdown run for a 21-0 lead in the first quarter. Cole ran 33 yards for a touchdown early in the second quarter and Woods scored on a 34-yard run as Watson Chapel took a 35-0 lead into halftime. Jackson’s second touchdown pass was 48 yards to Jaquan Dorsey in the third quarter. \nSports on 10/17/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:02:31.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
