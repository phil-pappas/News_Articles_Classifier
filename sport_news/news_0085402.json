He hurts his ankle on the play and does not return. \nRutgers has two cracks at a two-point conversion – after a penalty – but fails both times. Indiana 52, Rutgers 33. \n“In terms of possessions, I couldn’t guarantee that we were going to get as many stops as we did,” coach Kyle Flood said, “so I started going for two a little earlier than I normally would.” Leonte Carroo, Rutgers star, 'definitely' playing vs. Ohio St. \nFourth Quarter \n14:50 remaining: An ominous beginning to the fourth quarter for Indiana as the snap on fourth-and-3 sails over the head of punter Eric Toth. \nToth tries to salvage the play by scooping up the ball, but it is knocked away toward defensive end Kemoko Turay, who scampers 26 yards for his first career touchdown. \nLaviano is sacked on a two-point conversion attempt. Indiana 52, Rutgers 39 . \n“That changed the whole ball game,” halfback Robert Martin said. “I was like, ‘I’ve seen this happen before against Maryland.’ I know we can pull this one out.” Rutgers defense stands tall in comeback win over Indiana \n13:22: Cornerback Isaiah Wharton makes his first career interception, a diving catch in which he barely is able to keep the ball off the ground with his hands. Replay confirms the interception. \nIndiana picked up 37 yards on the drive and likely would have kept the offense on the field on fourth-and-9 from Rutgers’ 39-yard line had Wharton dropped the ball. \n“That was big-time,” safety Anthony Cioffi said. “He made a great play on the ball and a great catch. That’s what we needed. That extra momentum to flip it our side.” \n10:00: Playing in place of the injured Carroo, Carlton Agudosi makes a 40-yard catch down the sideline. \n9:22: Robert Martin scores his third rushing touchdown of the game, matching his career-high total set against … Indiana last season. Indiana 52, Rutgers 46. Chris Laviano, Rutgers QB, quiets critics with comeback win \n9:17: Perhaps feeling desperate, Sudfeld makes a terrible decision to heave a deep pass into double coverage on first down. The ball-hawk Cioffi makes the interception. \n“It was a play that we ran in practice a lot,” Cioffi said. “Coach (Joe) Rossi was telling me, ‘Go get it. Read your keys.’ And that’s what I did.” \n6:29: With five carries for five yards up until this point, Paul James takes a hand-off right and bursts into another gear after clearing the first level of the defense for a 40-yard touchdown run. \nIt’s the first touchdown of the season for James, Rutgers starting running back. \nIt’s also the perfect example of halfback-by-committee benefits, as Rutgers subbed out Martin after three straight carries for 22 yards and had fresh legs against a fatigued defense. \nThe PAT attempt is blocked. Rutgers 52, Indiana 52. \n“I made my block and I looked and I was like, ‘Where is he? Where is he?’” left tackle Keith Lumpkin said. “I looked and he hit the edge and he kept going.” \n5:15: Devine Redding is tackled by Sebastian Joseph for a three-yard loss on a third-and-1. \nKey question: Why did Indiana run the ball at all? \nAbandoning the run is easier said than done, but coach Kevin Wilson should have realized after failing to convert multiple third- and fourth-and-shorts on the ground earlier in the game that passing was his smartest bet. \n1:26: All those spring practice connections between Laviano and Agudosi pay off as they connected for a 16-yard completion on third-and-6. \n:47: Laviano. Agudosi. 16 yards. Third-down conversion. Again. \n“We expected Carlton to make plays,” Laviano said, “and that’s exactly what he did.” \n:00: Kyle Federico atones for two missed PATs earlier in the game, drilling a 26-yard field goal as time expires. Rutgers 55, Indiana 52. \n“We had a couple PATs blocked in the game and we end the game on a field goal,” Flood said, “so there is probably some irony there.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 12 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LCF3DS TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:16:15.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
