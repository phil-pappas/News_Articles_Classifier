Sherritt. “But at the same time, we’re perfectionists and we hold ourselves to the highest standards. We played as a team, we played together and we played to the very end so it was a great win.” \nAnd Sherritt’s first at McMahon since he was named the West Division nominee for rookie of the year. \n“I don’t think I’ve won here since my first game as a rookie, and that’s five years ago. So that’s pretty crazy,” Sherritt said. “We control our own destiny now, that’s all you can ask for. \n“Obviously, B.C.’s beat us once and took us to the limit the other time, so if we rest on this game and think it’s over then we’re going to be back in second place real quick. So we understand what’s ahead of us.” \nThe path to the post-season will see them home to the B.C. Lions and on the road in Regina before closing out their schedule with a bye following a game against the Montreal Alouettes in Commonwealth Stadium. \n““It’s not like they’re going to lose another game,” said Eskimos head coach and defensive co-ordinator Chris Jones. “Now they’ll really kick it in and we’ve got to go out and take each individual week as a challenge as the next team up and win the game.” \nCalgary had been trailing by 14-1 in the second quarter following a 33-yard touchdown reception by Kenny Stafford for his league-leading ninth of the season. \nField goals of 30 and 43 yards by Sean Whyte – fresh off kicking the 53-yard game-winner in Winnipeg on week earlier, saw the Stampeders answer back with a league-leading receiver of their own, as Eric Rodgers added a 30-yard touchdown catch to his CFL-best yardage. \nFollowing up with a two-point convert on the ground by running back Jon Cornish, Calgary trailed the visitors 14-10 at halftime before trading a punt single in the third and fourth quarter. \n“It means that we’re in first place, we control our own destiny and if we win out beating B.C., Saskatchewan and Montreal, then we get a first-round bye,” Jones said. “Anytime you can beat an opponent as good as they are – Huf’s won what, 80% of his games? -- those guys know how to win over there. Even when we had them down 14-1, they came right back and kept scratching and grinding.” Edmonton Eskimos move into 1st with win over Calgary Stampeders By Gerry Moddejonge , Edmonton Sun First posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 09:39 PM MDT | Updated: Saturday, October 10, 2015 10:17 PM MDT \nCALGARY – Sure, they moved into first place and assured themselves a home playoff date, but the main thing on the minds of the Edmonton Eskimos Saturday night was the fact they just beat the Calgary Stampeders. \nA 15-11 Eskimos win handed the opposition their first blemish at home, in front of 32,211, after the Stampeders came into the game in sole possession of first place with a 7-0 record at McMahon Stadium on the year. \nAnd now, both teams now have 11-4 records, with the Eskimos earning the tie-breaker thanks to capturing the season series two games to one. \nBut Saturday’s win marked Edmonton’s first on Stampeders soil since 2011, reviving a post-game emotion from the visitors locker-room that was long lost. \n“We did enough to win in Calgary, so that’s pretty dang good,” said Eskimos linebacker J.C.
