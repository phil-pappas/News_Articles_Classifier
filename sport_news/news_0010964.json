We’re really supportive of each other. It is a competitive environment, but it is one where we’re pushing everyone to be better.” \nThe Chargers (15-8, 4-1) needed that attitude after dropping two of the first three sets. In the fourth, Edison scored 10 consecutive points to take a 16-8 lead. Newport Harbor never got closer than four points the remainder of the set. \nThe fifth set saw multiple momentum swings. Newport Harbor scored the first four points, followed by Edison scoring five consecutive points. \nThe Chargers took a 12-7 lead on a kill from Phair. Newport Harbor pulled within 12-11 on a block by Amanda Walker , but Edison eventually prevailed. \n“It could have been a big logjam for second place, but it was good to finish 4-1 and get in position to do well in the second half of league,” Edison coach Matt Skolnik said. “We needed to stay aggressive. Newport is a really good defensive team and we needed to keep going at them, serve tough and attack aggressively.” \nRemy Wilson led the Sailors (8-14, 2-3) with 17 kills. \nAlso in the Sunset League: \nNo. 3 Huntington Beach 3, Fountain Valley: Camryn Sanchez led the visiting Oilers (21-4, 5-0) with nine kills in the 25-16, 25-12, 25-11 victory. The Oilers didn’t lose a set through their first half of league matches. \nContact the writer: dcalhoun@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:18:03.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
