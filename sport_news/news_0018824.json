(Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE For the moment, at least, Grant Enfinger is focused only on the task at hand — winning the ARCA Racing Series presented by Menards championship in Friday’s season finale at Kansas Speedway.\nBut if opportunities present themselves afterward, he’ll be available.\nEnfinger, a 30-year-old stock car veteran from Fairhope, Ala., will claim the championship by starting the Full Throttle S’loonshine 98.9. He enters the event with a 320-point lead over Josh Williams. With six victories this season, Enfinger’s career total has reached 14 victories in 90 ARCA races.\nIf advancement happens, it’s likely to come from within. His team, North Carolina-based GMS Racing, fields entries in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series for Spencer Gallagher and Brandon Jones.\nUSA TODAY\nNASCAR moves to low downforce package for 2016 season\n“It’s been my experience that the opportunities usually find me rather than me finding the opportunities,” Enfinger told USA TODAY Sports. “That’s the way it’s worked out for me in the past. I feel like I’ve found a home here at GMS Racing. There has been some stuff talked about, but really our whole focus this year has been to get us in the position we’re in right now.”\nWith wins at Daytona, Mobile and Nashville, Enfinger became the only driver in ARCA history to open consecutive seasons by winning the first three races.\n“It’s been a long year but it’s been a good year overall,” Enfinger said. “We had some ups and down, but we’ve had really good speed all year. We’ve gotten the results when we needed them.”\nUSA TODAY\nWhat to watch for at Kansas Speedway\nWhile the repeat victory in the season opener at Daytona ranks among the season highlights, Enfinger’s favorite win is his most recent. On Sept. 19 at Salem (Ind.) Speedway, Enfinger accidentally hit the kill switch while running second in his No. 23 Champion Power Equipment Chevrolet.\n“I couldn’t get it figured out,” Enfinger said. “Finally my crew chief (Jeff Stankiewicz) helped me over the radio get it fired up without losing a lap. We came from the back to win it. Basically, that’s the way the year has gone. We got into bad situations — whether it was our doing or just circumstances — but for the most part we’ve done a good job of digging ourselves out of holes.”\nAs for the future, that will have to wait until the weekend.\n“I’d definitely like to move up, but our main focus is getting to Friday night,” Enfinger said. “That’s been our focus all year. Once Saturday morning rolls around, we’ll start worrying about 2016.”\nFollow Olson on Twitter @jeffolson77\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN ", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RKEA3u&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805156410946528-enfinger.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4555602908001_4555585756001-vs.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RKEA3u&text=ARCA%27s%20Grant%20Enfinger%20focused%20on%20championship%20first%2C%20opportunities%20second&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a60b5bf244cce8024b0aea2c8f74d99d366685af/c=750-0-3572-2822/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804253022173821-odonnell.jpg", "http://twitter.com/jeffolson77", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/779a75f264d58083a18a10b9c7a8efb8fdaa7401/r=294x400/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805156410946528-enfinger.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0fc88bdd17b966812716544103f06e8e421f6ac5/c=369-578-1589-2205&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805156410946528-enfinger.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:50:40.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
