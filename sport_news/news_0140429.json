Join the Conversation Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 6:34 p.m. CDT October 24, 2015 Auburn coach Gus Malzahn addresses media after 54-46 overtime loss Saturday night at Arkansas. Duane Rankin/Montgomery Advertiser \nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — In nearly every conceivable way Saturday, Auburn dropped the ball. \nAuburn receivers dropped seven passes, defensive backs dropped two potential interceptions and in the biggest picture they dropped the ball of momentum on the 2015 season. \nIn its 54-46 four overtime loss Saturday afternoon at Razorbacks Stadium, the very little hope this Tigers team had to salvage their motivational “2-0 in October” way of thinking has to also be dropped. \n“That was a tough one, there’s no doubt about it,” Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn said in his first sentence describing the loss. “We got to catch the ball. I’ve been coaching for 25 years so I bet I’ve seen a little bit of everything but we have to catch the ball better.” \nThe loss puts Auburn still two wins away from bowl eligibility and continues the Tigers woes against Southeastern Conference competition continues. Malzahn is 1-6 in his last seven SEC games and the winless streak against Western Division opponents on the road will stretch a full calendar year. Auburn (4-3, 1-3 in SEC) left Razorback Stadium in last place in the Western Division and will likely be an underdog in four of its five final regular season games. \n“Honestly, I don’t know because this one will hurt for a while,” Auburn receiver Ricardo Louis said about how he’ll recover from the four overtime defeat. “I didn’t execute.” \nSaturday represented Auburn’s first multiple overtime game in 13 years since the Tigers defeated Syracuse 37-34 in three overtimes in 2002. \nRicardo Louis (5) attempts to catch a pass against Arkansas in a game on October 24, 2015 in Fayetteville, Ark.

However, that statistic doesn’t account for a drop during a penalized plays and two drops by Auburn defensive backs on questionable throws by Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen . \nThose drops by the offense led to three straight three-and-out drives for Auburn and suddenly the Tigers found themselves in a 14-0 deficit on the road. In the first quarter, Arkansas held Auburn to 15 total yards of offense and Arkansas (3-4, 2-2 in SEC) controlled possession for nearly 11 and a half minutes. \n“Lack of concentration and we just got to come out better than that,” Auburn receiver Melvin Ray said. “It was an early game. We just got to come out ready to go earlier instead of giving up so much time to get going. We’ve got the ability to make those plays. We’ve just got to do it.” \nIf the Auburn drops were receptions Saturday, redshirt freshman quarterback Sean White would’ve finished 26 of 32 through the air and would’ve recorded much more than his 254 yards. Due to the botched pass plays, White still hasn’t thrown a touchdown pass in his career after four starts. \n“We just tell him keep doing what you’re doing because that’s on everybody in the receiver room obviously,” Ray said. “It’s not his fault and the accountability of a loss is on us. We have to start helping out our quarterback.” \nEven after tying the score on back-to-back touchdown drives to close the first half and open the second half, Auburn never had a lead in regulation and couldn’t rely on an enigmatic defense to close out Arkansas at any point in overtime. \nArkansas loaded up its ground game again but pounding one of the SEC’s worst run defenses for 213 yards and 4.3 yards per carry. Alex Collins had 105 yards on 25 carries and a touchdown but the Razorbacks had every tailback average at least four yards a touch. \n“We knew to win this game…we were going to have to run the football, take advantage of play action pass, move the chains and be consistent on third down,” Arkansas head coach Bret Bielema said. “We have a lot of young guys playing some really good football.” \nKris Frost (17) interception Arkansas vs Auburn football on October 24, 2015 in Fayetteville, Ark.

With Arkansas up 24-21, White led Auburn on a 50-yard drive in 63 seconds thanks to two critical completions to Louis to set up Daniel Carlson’s game-tying 41-yard field goal. \n“You put forth all this effort toward the week, and you grind as hard as you possibly can and you fight throughout the whole entire game and come up short, it hurts,” Auburn linebacker Kris Frost said. \nAuburn will try to end its 372-day winless drought in SEC home games as they welcome Ole Miss to Jordan-Hare Stadium on Halloween afternoon.
