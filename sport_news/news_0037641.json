Jail records don't list an attorney who could comment on his behalf. \nAuthorities haven't released the victim's name. \nJohnson played for the Aggies in 2012. He had three catches for 22 yards in A&M's 29-24 win at top-ranked Alabama. He disappeared a few days later and wasn't seen until he appeared at his family's Dallas home three days later. \nAll content copyright ©2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:29:13.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
