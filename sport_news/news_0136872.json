Last week at the World Series of Speedway Racing at Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park, the Stafford driver won the Modified Racing Series point championship and the Sunoco Modified title. Pitkat was also in the thick of the battle for the Whelen Modified Tour championship and settled for his best finish ever, third-place behind Doug Coby and Ryan Preece. On Sunday, he capped off the month and his season with a win in the Tri-Track Modified Series finale and a $5,000 first-place check at the Super Bowl of Auto Racing at the New London-Waterford Speedbowl. “This is definitely right up there with winning at Loudon (New Hampshire),” Pitkat said.”I’ve had some big wins on the (Whelen Modified) Tour. But to do this — especially with the Valenti (Modified Racing Series) car which I’ve only really won with at Stafford - to be able to venture out (of Stafford) and win, it feels really cool.” Pitkat started ninth and worked his way through the field, getting up to third by lap 10. It was on a 19th lap restart that Pitkat saw his opening. He passed both Steve Masse and Chase Dowling take the lead. “(Masse) likes to go hard and I saw he wasn’t really warming up his tires and I didn’t know what he was doing there. So, I just tried to get good heat in the tires and thought maybe he would slip. He got a good start, but I shifted before him and tried to drive it in there,” Pitkat described. Les Hinckley, in his first time in the No. 52 car, finished second with Ronnie Silk bringing home third place after a late charge. SK Modifieds The other $5,000 check went to Keith Rocco. Rocco won the last two races of the night including the 75-lap SK Modified nationals which brought with it the big pay day. It was the third straight win for Rocco in the SK Nationals and he did so by outlasting both Matt Hirschman and Ted Christopher. Rocco took the lead for good on the 37th lap. “The car was awesome all night,” Rocco said. “We got up there and this thing just started rolling on the top. I thought it was going to go back and forth the whole race with Ted, but we were able to get out front and go for it.” Like the races before it, the SK race was loaded with a lot of bent fiberglass. It started with 31 cars and ended with 15. Page 2 of 2 - One of the hardest hits of the night came on a restart on the 44th lap. Tim Jordan of Plainfield and Craig Lutz came together on the front stretch, destroying both cars and also taking out Zach Sylvester and Paul Buzel. “Somebody didn’t go on a start and I got shoved from behind. It’s unfortunate we got involved with Craig Lutz, I know he probably thinks I wrecked him on purpose. When you run in the back, this is what happens. We probably have to get a new car for next year,” Jordan said. Rocco also won the 30-lap Late Model feature which was only eight cars strong. Legend cars With just a half-lap left in the 35-lap “Battle of the Sound” feature, the yellow flag flew. “I didn’t even know that was legal. I thought once we had the white (flag), it was over. I was like ‘“What’s going on?’” Dylan Izzo said. Instead, Izzo had to endure a pair of green-white-checkered restarts with a fellow SK Modified driver, Jeff Rocco, right behind him. “He was playing with the throttle down the backstretch trying to intimidate me,” Izzo said. “He got a great start, but no one beat me on a restart.” Izzo, in his first race in the No. 21x car, sprinted past Rocco on both the restarts and won the $2,200 first-place prize, the biggest first-place prize awarded in a Legend car race in Connecticut. Rocco finished second with Dana Dimatteo in third. SK Lights Two drivers pretty familiar with one another, Nick Salva and Tony Membrino, battled throughout the 25 lap feature with Salva claiming the win. Both drive regularly at Stafford Speedway, but that’s not the only thing they have in common. “I’m dating his cousin and have been for about two years, so that’s a little twist on the situation,” Salva said with a laugh. “We’ve been great friends, race very hard, and had some incidents, but racing is racing and there are no friends on the race track.” By Marc Allard The Bulletin The Bulletin By Marc Allard The Bulletin Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 10:09 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:31:13.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
