While mourning has newly begun, campus leaders are working to figure out how instructors can cover material for 10-and-a-half week courses in just nine weeks.\n\"We have been hurt really badly, but we are tough,\" said interim college president Rita Cavin. \"We are going to get through this.\"\nFunerals for the nine victims will begin as early as Thursday; two are set for Saturday and Sunday.\nPresident Obama announced Friday that he plans to travel to Roseburg as part of an already planned West Coast trip. He'll meet privately with victims' families. The president went on national TV a few hours after the shootings on Thursday to urge tighter gun control laws.\nEight students and a writing instructor, all residents of Roseburg or nearby small towns, died in the gunfire. Nine more were injured. The gunman, a student, was shot by police before he fled and shot himself to death.\nGov. Kate Brown intervened on behalf of the families last week to get victims' sped back to Roseburg from a Portland-area medical examiners office in military helicopters.\nMore details emerged this weekend and Monday about the nine students who were wounded but not killed by gunfire Thursday. They ranged in age from 16 to at least 34, and included Amber McMurtrey, a mother of two studying to become a nurse, said her niece Maddie Chane. McMurtrey, 34, was hit by eight bullets, including in her abdomen and arm, said another niece, Aly Chane.\nMcMurtrey is one of four students still hospitalized from injuries suffered in the shooting. She is recovering and in fair condition at Sacred Heart Medical Center hospital in Springfield following multiple surgeries. Two other women still are hospitalized there as well, one in critical condition.\nCheyeanne Fitzgerald, just 16 and also studying to become a nurse, was still recovering at Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg Monday after being shot in the stomach and losing a kidney.\nA return to campus\nThe mood on campus Monday was reflective. College employees all reported back to work Monday, and students who had left phones, cars or other possessions behind were allowed back to retrieve them.\nSnyder Hall, the classroom building where the shooting occurred, remains off limits, with Douglas County sheriff's officials on site. Thick black plastic prevents people from seeing inside, and the road through campus is blocked at least 100 yards from the building.\nElsewhere on campus Monday, clusters of students and teachers talked quietly at sun-drenched picnic tables. The 100-acre campus feels like a park, lush and green with views of surrounding hills and the meandering North Umpqua River.\nTwo dozen counselors were on campus Monday to listen and provide comfort to grieving students. More than 200 took up on the offers of help, said college spokesman Greg Harris.\nTracy Stepp, a 29-year-old student who was in a writing class next door to where most deaths and injuries occurred, saw her teacher, Jillanne Michell, for the first time since before the shooting. Stepp offered condolences for the loss of Michell's fellow teacher, Lawrence Levine.\n\"We're trying to get through it,\" Stepp said, adding that she is drawing strength from God. During the shooting, she said, \"I prayed over our classroom, and another lady joined me.\"\nThe mass shootings, the worst in Oregon history, rocked Douglas County on just the fourth day of fall term. More than 3,000 students are enrolled, and they and their instructors will try to pick up the pieces to finish the term in just eight and a half more weeks.\nThe campus has only a half dozen classroom buildings, so officials will have to bring in portable classrooms to ensure all classes can continue when the term resumes Monday, said Ben Cannon, executive director of Oregon's Higher Education Coordinating Commission.\nLeaders at the college have a huge job ahead to get the school restarted and finish the fall term. Some of the tasks are concrete and practical, such as filing insurance claims and repairing Snyder Hall.\nRepairing emotional damage and restoring a sense of security will be tougher, officials said. But campus leaders are determined to do it.\nDr. Christine Seals of the Umpqua Health Alliance , knows a family that lost a son in the shooting, and her own child attends Umpqua. She said solidarity will be key.\n\"I can think of no better way to honor the victims and the students here at this campus than to support education in our community,'' she said. \"Alone, like a single pencil, we can be broken. Together, like a bunch of pencils, we are strong.\"\nBefore Thursday, Umpqua was a peaceful, scenic place to attend school. Tree-lined paths connect a series of 16 buildings and halls. Some of the Roseburg area's best views can be had from the Southern Oregon Wine Institute building, where students study viticulture and enology.\nIt was beside that building Monday that school and mental health officials talked about the shock they feel now and how they expect to get past the terror of Thursday's massacre.\n\"We know the community is worried about us,\" Cavin said. \"But we are tough, and we are strong, and we are going to get through this.\"\nWhile the Roseburg community has myriad emotional challenges ahead, campus leaders also have logistical obstacles to work out, Cannon said. Beyond finding more classroom space and adjusting instructional time, they will have to decide how and whether to create memorials or tributes to victims on campus. And they will need to address campus safety, both in terms of analyzing Thursday's shooting and whether anything could have prevented the attack and finding ways to reassure students and faculty.\nOfficials from other colleges, including the University of Oregon and Lane Community College, have left their schools to pitch in with the job of getting the Roseburg college back on track. Chemeketa Community College lent Umpqua its public information officer, Harris, to field the endless questions from reporters.\nUmpqua plans to finish the term as scheduled on Dec. 12, Cannon said.\nCavin retired as president of Linn-Benton Community College 12 years ago and is running Umpqua on an interim basis this year.\nJan Woodcock, a professor of social sciences and humanities, said she and fellow staff members will do their best to offer returning students \"the best of our intellects, our hearts and our devotion. We will learn about things this year that were not on our syllabus ... We are with you in this.\"\nBetsy Hammond\nbetsyhammond@oregonian.com\n@chalkup\nStuart Tomlinson\nstomlineson@oregonian.com\n@ORweather\nAdditional reporting by Jeff Mapes, Laura Frazier, Elliot Njus and Lynne Terry.", "external_links": ["https://www.thelundreport.org/content/community-health-alliance-names-dr-christine-seals-board-chair", "http://www.umpqua.edu/"], "published": "2015-10-06T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:18:12.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
