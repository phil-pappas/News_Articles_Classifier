Salary-cap considerations, however, led to 32-year-old forward David Lee being dealt by the Warriors to the Celtics in July for Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb. Lee, who will make a team-high $15.4 million in the final year of his contract this season, has been making a smooth transition to a new situation after playing on a title team just a few months ago. “I think I landed in a great situation with a great opportunity, and now it’s about going out and having fun and making the most of it,’’ said Lee, who started and had seven points and eight rebounds in a 99-85 preseason win over the New York Knicks on Thursday night at the TD Garden. “Make no mistake about it: I love Golden State and would have preferred to stay there forever. (But) this is one heckuva opportunity and I’m really, really excited to be here.’’ Lee lost his starting job to Draymond Green after suffering a preseason hamstring injury last fall and had a reduced role in the Warriors’ run to the championship. Golden State needed to clear salary space for the 2015-16 season, and Lee was the obvious choice to go. The Celtics, in need of veteran help up front on a young team, jumped at the chance to acquire Lee, now in his 11th season. “I just thought it was a good fit, a young team looking for leadership and looking for a veteran who has been through a lot of battles,’’ said Lee. “I fit that and I wanted to be with a good group of guys. I don’t want to play with guys who don’t want to be here or don’t respect the game. “We have one of the best locker rooms in the league, so it was a perfect fit there. Of course, with the tradition and playing in a city like this, that goes without saying. I thought it was a perfect fit. Luckily, they really wanted me here just like I wanted to be here.’’ Lee, who has averaged 9.3 points and 7.8 rebounds in four preseason games, said that winning a title before departing the Warriors made it somewhat easier to leave the team he spent five seasons with after signing as a free agent in 2010. “My friends, my family, they are constantly (saying), ‘Watching Golden State play in the preseason games must be awful to watch and not be out there.’ Really, there’s something about leaving when there’s no unfinished business. Page 2 of 2 - “If I would have left and we had lost in the (NBA) finals last year, I would have been, ‘Man, they have a chance to win it (this season).’ This was strictly a move of numbers in basketball with the salary cap. It wasn’t like they didn’t want me. “Leaving on the note that I did, though, being able to contribute in the playoffs the way I did and winning the championship, I have no regrets. I love it out there, have great memories, (but) I’m a guy who tries to live in the present and I’m excited about being here right now.’’ Around the rim: The Celtics (5-1) finish the preseason schedule by playing the Philadelphia 76ers tonight in Manchester, N.H. … Isaiah Thomas (left knee tendinitis) sat out his second straight game but may get some minutes this evening. … Kelly Olynyk was given the night off to rest. … Avery Bradley suffered a bruised right shin during the third quarter. … Carmelo Anthony played 32 minutes and went 4 for 18, scoring eight points for the Knicks as Jae Crowder was on him for most of the game. “He’s very tough, very physical,’’ said Crowder, who had 13 points and seven rebounds. “I just tried to make it hard for him and wear him down on both ends of the court.’’… Celtics coach Brad Stevens celebrated his 39th birthday on Thursday. … Starters Marcus Smart had nine assists and seven points while Tyler Zeller scored 15 points. Jared Sullinger contributed 16 points, eight rebounds and six assists off the bench.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:41:03.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
