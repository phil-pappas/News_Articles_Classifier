After winning the Union County Championship for the past nine years, it was up to the 2015 squad to put an exclamation point on the past decade. \nWestfield was able to do just that with a complete team effort. Three girls finished in the top five of the competition to help the Blue Devils once again raise the team trophy at the end of the night. Westfield completed the four events with a total score of 108.900 for its 10th straight title. \n“We were so nervous,” team captain Carlie Fasano said. “The entire week we have been saying we need to get this decade of wins. We were putting so much pressure on ourselves. It was really nerve racking, but we all pushed through. It came down to every point. We worked hard for it.” \nFasano paved the way for Westfield by finishing second overall in the all-around standings with a tally of 36.250 -- a small margin behind Arthur L. Johnson’s Gina Ferdinandi, who had a 36.575. Fasano had a rewarding experience during her last Union County Championship of her career. The senior has been battling through injuries the past two years, but on Friday night she was able to breathe a sigh relief. \n“Carlie is a great competitor,” Westfield coach Amanda Diaz said. “I’ve been working with her since she was a freshman. She’s had some injuries that she had to overcome, so it’s really great that she was able to show everybody what she has in her senior year. She wanted to win and she proved that to us on the floor and on the beam.” \nThe beam has been an area where the Blue Devils have struggled over the course of the season, but they didn’t allow that to get to their head during the county championship. Fasano put together her best total during the beam, finishing with a 9.550, which was good enough for gold. \n“Before beam we all have a huddle and we have a tradition where we pray to the beam gods,” Fasano said. “It really helps us give each other confidence. We are able to put everything into beam because usually that is where we struggle at meets. We needed to put everything into it.” \nKaela Azzaretto, who is a freshman, was able to finish in third place in in the all-around standings with a score of 35.300. Sarah Fox closely followed with a score of 35.075. Megan Melillo ended the contest by finishing in the top six in three events. \n“This year has been the essence of team effort in the sense of this has been a well rounded group of girls,” Westfield coach Laurie McCormack said. “We have strengths in each event and all of them really contributed to this win.” \nLast year Jenna Rizkalla had the meet record and Hannah Goldring came in second in the all-around standings to claim the county victory for Westfield. This year they depended on new faces to lead the way. \n“We lost a few of our key competitors but we also gained some excellent new girls,” Diaz said. “We have a freshman, Kaela Azzaretto, who finished in second all-around. They strived off of what we accomplished last year and they brought it into this year to hold onto their titles.” \nThe Blue Devils were able to edge Cranford by a small gap in the team standings. Cranford defeated Westfield during the regular season, but this day was different -- it belonged to the Blue Devils. \n“The team worked really hard together,” Diaz said. “They really came together as a team. They kind of bounced off of each other’s scores and they really hit every event. As you can see we had three girls place in the top five from Westfield, from all grade levels.” \nStaff Writer Steven Macri: smacri@gannettnj.com 4 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1S1KBsN TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:36:56.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
