The report cites \"multiple sources close to the situation.\"\nA person with knowledge of the situation told USA Today Sports that Maryland athletics director Kevin Anderson had not yet made up his mind but did not dismiss the idea that something could happen this weekend. The person requested anonymity because the matter has not been resolved.\nMaryland is idle the week after the Ohio State game, which can be a logical time for a transition to an interim coach.\nRegardless, it appears a coaching change at Maryland is inevitable barring a massive and immediate turnaround. Maryland is 2-3 this season and has been non-competitive in its last two games: a 45-6 loss at West Virginia and a 28-0 home loss to Michigan in which it managed just 105 yards of offense.\nThe notion that a coaching change might be warranted came as early as Week 2, when Maryland lost 48-27 to Bowling Green in front of more than 20,000 empty seats.\nEdsall, who experienced significant success in his previous stop at UConn, is just 22-33 at Maryland. Earlier this year, he signed a contract extension through 2019, but only a portion of that salary was guaranteed. In other words, there is not a significant financial obstacle to removing Edsall.\nThe Maryland job could be intriguing to a number of candidates given its location and support from Baltimore-based Under Armour, whose CEO Kevin Plank is Maryland's top booster and is helping the school build millions of dollars in new facilities.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:30:07.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
