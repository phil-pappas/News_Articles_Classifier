Of the 16 players signed before camp, all but MASL veterans Carlos Farias and Alex Megson (prior commitments) practiced all week. The former league MVP Farias, 39, will also serve alongside Kraft as an assistant coach. \nA few unsigned players were also invited to camp, including Brazilian twins Gustavo and Guilherme Rodrigues. Both were impressive throughout the week and signed to contracts on Friday. Goalkeeper Alexis Apodaca, who was an MASL rookie last season with the Ontario Fury, was also signed. \nThe Rampage training camp has featured a solid mix of MASL veterans and league rookies. Kraft singled out a pair of local names – former Cedar Rapids Xavier player Charlie Bales and Chris Fitch, who played at Coe – as two rookies who have had an especially strong week. The confluence of young, hungry newcomers and wily league veterans all vying for a spot on an expansion roster has only heightened the level of competition. \n“It’s a fresh start for everybody,” said midfielder Armando Tello, who split time between Tacoma and Detroit in the MASL last season. “The face of the franchise is up for grabs and a lot of players want it.” \nKraft and the players have already been out in the community generating interest in the club, including a stop at the Tuma Soccer Complex last weekend during a youth soccer tournament. \nSaturday is the first of three games before the regular season begins Nov. 6. The Rampage will visit the Milwaukee Wave in two weeks, then debut at the U.S. Cellular Center Oct. 30 against St. Louis. \n“I think it will be a huge test for us,” said goalkeeper Steven Hamersky, who played for Kraft at now-defunct Wichita last season. “It will be a good wakeup for all of us to know this is the pace that we’re at and this is where we need to be.” \nCEDAR RAPIDS RAMPAGE TRAINING CAMP PARTICIPANTS \nMASL veterans — Alexis Apodaca, Carlos Farias, Samuel Guernsey, Steven Hamersky, Kevin Jackson, Alex Megson, Kyle Nsien, Alfee Robbins, Armando Tello, Alex Tozer. \nRookies — Charlie Bales (C.R.
