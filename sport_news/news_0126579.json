(AP Photo/Joe Mahoney) By PAUL NEWBERRY \nDan Quinn cranked up the music and turned up the energy for the Atlanta Falcons. \nSo far, the results have been nothing short of amazing. \nAfter winning only 10 games the last two seasons, the Falcons are 4-0 for their new coach. \nIt's much the same in New York, where Todd Bowles has the Jets sitting at 3-1. Gary Kubiak took over a winning team in Denver and kept it going, guiding the Broncos to a perfect start through the first month of the season. \nThis is not all that unusual. \nA check of the last 20 years by The Associated Press showed that two-third of coaches who took over before the start of a season led their new team to a better record than the previous year. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:29:41.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
