Bryant was in shoulder pads and wearing a helmet, just like the other Cowboys players on Thursday. Bryant walked out alongside athletic trainer Britt Brown. He went over to the side of the field and jogged as he caught some passes.\nBryant, who is recovering from a fractured bone on the outside of his right foot, was working on the side to start practice and remained there during the portion open to the media.d\nCowboys coach Jason Garrett said that Bryant worked on the side throughout Wednesday's practice and did some running and cutting, but not at full speed.\nThree other players weren't practicing Thursday for the Cowboys: defensive end Greg Hardy was out with an illness, defensive lineman David Irving was out with a sore back and safety Danny McCray was away from the team because of personal reasons. All three fully participated in practice Wednesday.\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nSherrington: Kool-Aid drinker Jerry Jones hasn't learned important football lesson\nBob Sturm: Examining the 2016 NFL draft from the Cowboys' perspective\nSabin: Dez not being counted out, but several factors make return vs. NYG unlikely for Cowboys star WR\nLaufenberg: Is Michael the answer?
