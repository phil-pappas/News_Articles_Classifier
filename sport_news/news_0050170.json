It’s going to be a long offseason.”\nThe Rangers became just the third team to lose a best-of-five series after winning the first two games on the road. The A’s blew a lead in 2001 against the Yankees , while Cincinnati wasted a 2-0 lead against the 2012 Giants. Both of the winners went on to reach the World Series.\n“It’s the most emotionally charged game that I’ve ever played,” Bautista said.\nThe Blue Jays will play the Royals in the ALCS, which begins Friday in Kansas City.\nDespite the tough finish in Toronto, first-year Rangers manager Jeff Banister said he was proud of his team for winning an AL West title that few thought was possible after ace Yu Darvish was lost for the season with an elbow injury. And after the team started the season 8-16, 91/2 games back in the division.\n“One inning won’t define who this ball club is and who they’ve been all season long,” Banister said.\nBautista’s homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin ’s throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score.\n“That was crazy,” Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman said. “With all that happened, we did a good job of keeping our emotions in check.”\nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay.\nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors, and Toronto rallied. Benches cleared twice in the Blue Jays’ half of the inning.\nRoberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save.\nAfter Edwin Encarnacion tied it 2-all with a second-deck drive off tough-luck loser Cole Hamels in the sixth, Odor led off the seventh with a single and went to third on a sacrifice and groundout.\nWith Choo up, Martin’s throw back to reliever Aaron Sanchez deflected off Choo’s left hand and dribbled toward third base.\nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned the call, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home.\nScott acknowledged making a mistake with his initial ruling.\n“I was mixing up two rules,” Scott said. “If there’s no intent, if he’s not out of the box, that throw is live.”\nFans littered the field with objects during the delay as umpires sorted out a play that is certain to rank up there with Derek Jeter ’s Jeffrey Maier homer or Reggie Jackson ’s hip block of a throw as one of the craziest in the postseason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:29:34.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
