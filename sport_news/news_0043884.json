Manziel, who spent 10 weeks in a rehab facility this offseason, admitted to officers that he had been drinking, but neither he nor his girlfriend were charged. The latest from SportsLine Week 6 NFL Picks But that doesn't mean the Browns aren't worried. Here's CBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora on The NFL Today :\n\"The Browns say they were aware of this situation and Manziel's status is unchanged. He is, in fact, backing up Josh McCown today. However, I'm told, there are serious concerns over the fact that he admitted he had been drinking earlier in the day, just a few months after getting out of rehab, but they have no plans for additional discipline for him right now.\" The Browns traded up in the 2014 NFL Draft to take Manziel 22nd overall and through 20 games, he's been a huge disappointment. ESPN analyst Merril Hoge called for Manziel to be released after Week 1 , and at the time it sounded a tad reactionary. Now, not so much.\n\"I've watched Johnny Manziel now for a year and a half and I think he's a backup quarterback at best. And he's a distraction off the field,\" CBS NFL analyst and former Steelers coach Bill Cowher said on The NFL Today . \"And listen, I believe in second chances but after the second chance, to me there's a zero-tolerance policy. He can't put himself into the position he put himself into. I would ask for his release and I would do it for this reason: in that locker room players want accountability ... and that's the message that needs to be sent right here, that you're accountable for your actions both on the field and off the field.\" Johnny Manziel had a tough week.
