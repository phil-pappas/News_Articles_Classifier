Bae needed to win the final hole for the International team to share the cup, but he stubbed a chip. \nThe Americans won 15 1/2-14 1/2, the closest competition in 10 years. \nThe tense final session was just what this competition needed, though it didn't feel that way to the International team. It looked like the International team had control until Chris Kirk holed a 15-foot putt on the 18th, and Anirban Lahiri lost the hole by missing a 4-foot putt.
