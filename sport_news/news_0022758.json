The planned park is adjacent to an area that was the site of a slow landslide in 1994 that threatened 30 homes and closed a mall. It cost about $5 million to stop, including $4 million in federal grant money. Resident Rene Larson says she and others worry that dirt work for the RV park could \"trigger a horror to again visit our neighborhood.\" Mayor Jerry Apa says the RV park could boost the local economy. He says he's also aware of the concerns and expects robust discussion at a Tuesday meeting of the city's Planning and Zoning Board. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
