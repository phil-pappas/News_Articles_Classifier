Show Caption Previous Next \nThe Tennessee soccer team couldn't overcome a slow start in Sunday's 3-1 loss to Missouri in Columbia, Mo. \nThe Vols (7-3-5, 3-3-2 SEC) spotted the Tigers two goals in the first half and never recovered. Missouri (7-4-4, 5-2-1) wasted little time grabbing the lead thanks to a goal by Reagan Russell in the 6th minute on the first shot of the game. \nThe second goal came in the 40th minute from Jessica Herrman just after Tennessee's Gabby Santorio was sent off with a red card â€” leaving the Vols down to 10 players for the remainder of the game. \nTennessee struggled to create offense in the first half, managing just two shots in the first 45 minutes. \nEven though they were down a player, the Vols put together a better effort in the second half. In the 49th minute, Amy Neal's fifth goal of the season pulled Tennessee within one. Anna McClung delivered the pass to Neal, who maneuvered around the Missouri goalkeeper to make room for the shot. Neal is tied with McClung for the team lead in goals. \nMissouri put the game away in the 76th minute with a penalty kick by Candace Johnson. UT's Susan Ferguson took down Jessica Johnson in the box to earn the shot. \nTennessee goalkeeper Julie Eckel saved six shots in the Vols' first road loss of the season. Coming into Sunday, Tennessee was 2-0-4 away from home. \nTennessee surrendered multiple goals in a game for only the third time this year. \nThe Vols return to Regal Stadium next weekend for their final two home games of the regular season. They host Ole Miss on Friday at 7 p.m. and Kentucky on Sunday at 5 p.m. for Senior Night. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
