Lamar Odom reportedly suffered numerous strokes shortly after he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel roughly two weeks ago.\nWhile Odom has shown signs of progress in recent days, various reports indicate he is not yet out of the woods. According to TMZ, Odom has a long way to go with both his motor skills and speech as a result of 12 strokes he suffered early on in his medical emergency. Odom will need to undergo months of physical therapy. It is unclear if the strokes caused any permanent damage.\nAdChoices Odom is still expected to survive, but it appears he is going to need at least one major medical procedure . TMZ also reported earlier in the week that the former NBA star has undergone two emergency surgeries in the hospital which have left him in a “fragile mental state.”\nOdom and Khloe Kardashian have withdrawn their divorce papers, and Odom has reportedly told Khloe he is done with drugs . The couple may also be facing some legal issues as a result of Odom’s overdose .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-prosecuted-cocaine-use/278964", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/24/lamar-odom-strokes/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-may-need-kidney-transplant/278706", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-told-khloe-kardashian-done-with-drugs/278961", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/22/lamar-odom-surgery/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:44:03.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
