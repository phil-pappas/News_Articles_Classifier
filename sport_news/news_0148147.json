Here are four storylines to watch: \nFIRST DOWN \nMONITORING YELDON’S WORK \nOnly six running backs through four weeks have at least two 20-carry games — Chicago’s Matt Forte (three) and two apiece for the Jaguars’ T.J. Yeldon, Minnesota’s Adrian Peterson, Pittsburgh’s DeAngelo Williams, Tampa Bay’s Doug Martin and Arizona’s Chris Johnson. Yeldon’s 70 carries are third in the league, behind Forte’s 84 and Peterson’s 75 and he’s playing 77.8 percent of the Jaguars’ snaps (217 of 279), which trails Forte (82.3) and Kansas City’s Jamaal Charles (81.4). The Jaguars are probably considering ways to get Yeldon more rest. Maybe this means there is a Toby Gerhart sighting this week. He’s played eight offensive snaps in his two games, including just one at Indianapolis. \nSECOND DOWN \nEXPANDING DAVIS’ ROLE \nLineman Ryan Davis has played only 23.5 percent of the defensive snaps (70 of 298), but leads the Jaguars with 2.5 sacks and four quarterback hits. Asked if Davis is a candidate to see early-down work, the insinuation being the four-man rush isn’t getting it done and could use a jolt, coach Gus Bradley said: “He plays special teams [73 snaps] and third downs. … To keep him productive on third down, I’m sure we’ll visit about it, but I don’t know if you’ll see any change in the future.” Maybe the Jaguars will put him in some first-down situations, like against Indianapolis when he split a sack with Chris Smith. \nTHIRD DOWN \nSECOND-HALF SHUTDOWN \nIt’s not surprising the Jaguars haven’t scored a lot of second-half points — they don’t score a lot of points at any point of the game. But compared to the rest of the NFL, their second-half productivity is astonishing. Through four weeks, the average-per-team second-half output is 46.3 points. The Jaguars have scored 17 points, fewest in the league. Chicago (19), Detroit (26) and San Francisco (28) are the only other teams below 30 points. The Jaguars’ 25 second-half drives have consisted of 16 punts, two touchdowns, two missed field goals, two turnovers, two failed fourth-down plays and one field goal. A solution? Well, no penalties would help. But maybe calling a gadget play on the initial third-quarter drive or a semi-hurry up to create a better tempo. \nFOURTH DOWN \nEVANS HANGS AROUND \nSome of us had Josh Evans’ bubble bursting during the preseason when Craig Loston started for the injured Johnathan Cyprien at strong safety. But as was the case during his first two NFL seasons, Evans keeps hanging around, a nod to his durability and knowledge of the defense. After seeing only special teams duty in the opener, Evans has played 33, 36 and 29 defensive snaps and totaled 13 tackles and one forced fumble. He split snaps with James Sample in Week 2 (subbing for Cyprien), took over for Sergio Brown (calf) in Week 3 and replaced Sample (shoulder) when he was injured in Week 4. Against Tampa Bay, he could start at free safety if Sample and Brown are unavailable. “It’s been exciting to capitalize on the snaps I do get and keep showing them I’m capable of playing this game at a high level and doing what is asked of me on defense,” Evans said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:48:01.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
