He’s definitely that guy. He’ll be a Day 1 pick. Potentially first round. Big, athletic kid. D-linemen don’t just fall off trees, man. So when you find someone that athletic with long arms and range, he’s a scout’s dream. He’s a guy you can put up on the board, and everybody in the organization will agree that he can make a difference.” \nBullard is also making a difference for Florida’s entire defensive line, too. \nAlthough Ole Miss’ defensive line is grabbing headlines leading into Saturday’s matchup with Florida, it’s the Gators’ line that has consistently gotten to the quarterback in 2015. \nUF ranks in a tie for sixth in the nation with 14 sacks this year, and the Rebels’ highly touted pass rush has managed three this season, good for 118th nationally. \nPart of that is from Bullard’s performance, but it’s also the way he affects his teammates. \nBefore Bullard decided to come back, first-year Gators coach Jim McElwain was faced with the prospect of an inexperienced defensive line that had no proven playmakers. \nSo to say he was happy to have the senior back would be an understatement. \n“I can’t tell you how glad I am that he chose to come back,” McElwain said. “Through consistent play, [he] is helping himself every time he’s out there. He’s been a great leader. He’s been a guy that I think has really grabbed that D-line group and has affected some guys in a real positive way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:32:08.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
