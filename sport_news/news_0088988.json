While insisting the needs of every special education will be met, CPS has said the cuts are based on enrollment losses.\nBut the protesters say the cuts are draconian and fail to take into account the varying needs of special education students. They say CPS is using a faulty formula in calculating the cuts.\n“When it comes to special education staffing needs, one size simply cannot fit all due to the nature of this special quality of special education,” Hughes said. “We plan to hold our elected officials accountable for allowing these negligent, cruel and abusive cuts to go through. And we will ensure parents across Chicago know their children’s rights.”\nProtesters said they plan to organize training sessions for parents to help them understand special education students’ rights.\nAld. Scott Waguespack (32 nd ) stood with the protesters, calling CPS’ special education policy “wrong-headed.”\n“Unless we want lawsuits raining down upon Chicago and on the CPS Board, do the right thing, Mayor (Rahm) Emanuel and (CPS) CEO [Forrest] Claypool,” Waguespack said.\nCPS spokeswoman Emily Bittner said in a statement: “Chicago Public Schools is committed to ensuring that all children with individual education programs will receive their needed services. If anyone is aware of a student whose IEP is not being met, we urge them to contact the District. We will continue to work with principals to ensure they have the resources they need to meet students’ IEPs, and we will continue to work with our partners in Springfield to prioritize education funding for all our children.”\nBittner was referring to the Individualized Education Program, a legal document that each special needs student receives outlining his or her rights and services that CPS must provide them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:07:21.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
