Jorge Lorenzo of Spain, riding a Yamaha, was third. \nLorenzo is 18 points behind Italian teammate and MotoGP championship leader Valentino Rossi, who will start from the second row of the grid in seventh position. \nMarquez had a best lap time of 1 minute, 28.364 seconds to claim his eighth pole of the season, and the 30th of his career despite nursing a fractured hand which he sustained before last week’s Japan Grand Prix.
