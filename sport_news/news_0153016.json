Those latter two teams will face off in a key Region 6-4A game at 7 p.m. Friday at Esau Lathon Field. \n\"We really don't like Kenwood,\" Wright said. \"This is a rivalry. We want to beat those guys. It is a region opponent and does have playoff implications, but more than anything we just want to win Friday. Really it doesn't matter who our opponent is, we want to win the day, win the week and get the win on Fridays. But the only difference this week is, it's against Kenwood. So we're going to go out and play our rear ends off.\" \nAnd the Vikings come into the game on a three-game win streak. Wright's team is already 4-2 and 1-1 in region play. It's the most wins for the Northwest program since 2009, the last time the Vikings reached the postseason. \n\"The one thing we focus on is not looking too far ahead,\" Wright said. \"We try every week to not discuss playoffs. As for the coaches, sure, it's in the back of our minds, and as a team our goal is to get there, but we don't worry too much about things that are still five or six weeks away. We're worrying about the here and now, and right now, it's all about Kenwood.\" \nThe Knights are on a two-game win streak of their own, having scored 28 and 32 points, respectively, in their last two contests. Wright knows that the key to stopping Kenwood is slowing down Antwuan Branch. \n\"I've watched quite a bit of film on Kenwood, so I feel like we have a good idea of what they like to do,\" Wright said. \"They've taken (Branch) and are playing him a lot more at running back the last few games and have played (James Williams) at quarterback. So we'll be prepared to face them in however they use Branch. If we can stop him, we'll have a good chance to win.\" Buy Photo \nNorthwest High takes on Kenwood in a key Region 6-4A game Friday night at Esau Lathon Field. (Photo: George Robinson/The Leaf-Chronicle) \nWilliams' ability to throw gives Kenwood the best option at a more balanced offensive attack. Early in the season, Branch often was used in shotgun with the spread option. Moving him to tailback and inserting Williams gives the Knights' offense a dual threat. But Knights coach Brian Beaubien said that change was more of a defensive decision. \n\"Antwuan was a standout linebacker last year, and he's our linebacker this year, but we were asking so much of him as a quarterback that he wasn't playing any defense and our defense was struggling,\" Beaubien said. \" Having both James and Antwuan in there actually takes RaeQuan Blackwell off the field, who we feel is a pretty good doggone running back as well.\" \nBeaubien said his team's offensive scheme won't change regardless of who is playing under center. \n\"Our kids are motivated any time we play any team in town,\" Beaubien said. \"For us, our kids understand the playoff format and region concept, so it doesn't matter who it is, it's a region game. We dropped one we shouldn't have against Hillwood so we have to take every game in the region as a must-win for here on out.\" \nFor Northwest, sophomore quarterback Hunter Silverstrum has made steady progress behind a line that has been the foundation of the Vikings' three-game streak. \n\"Goldberg Johnsrud at right guard is a big ole nasty guy, and he and Craig Barbour, on the other side, have been really leading the way,\" Wright said. \"Our backs, Jahnal Browne and Desmond Daniels, have had great games because those guys up front defensively, Sammy Curtis and Micah Bennett, have played well. It's been a complete team effort so far.\" \nReach Prep writer George Robinson at 931-245-0747 and on Twitter @Cville_Sports. \nFRIDAY'S PREP FOOTBALL GAMES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:47:46.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
