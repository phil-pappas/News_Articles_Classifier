Union minister of state for sports Sarbanando Sonowal is also an MP from Assam. He (Sonowal) should have realized the attachment and emotion associated with Bhogali Bihu festivity in the state. It is very unfortunate that despite representing Assam, Sonowal failed to understand the emotion of people in the state,\" Narah said in the statement.\nChief minister Tarun Gogoi said that the state government is ready to extend all cooperation in organizing the sports event, but it is not in favour with the present timing.\nThe state government has asked the sports ministry to postponed the timing of the proposed event so that inconvenience is avoided during the festivity\n\"We will request the centre to postpone the timing of South Asian Games after Bihu. If the sports event is held during Bhogali Bihu it will create problem,\" a statement from chief minister's office said.
