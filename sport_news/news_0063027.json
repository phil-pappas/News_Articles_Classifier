I’m not answering it again. You’re done.” Cal refuses to let a question be asked about Skal's guardian reportedly asking how to get money for a player. \n— Jerry Tipton (@JerryTipton) October 14, 2015 \nDENIED.

J-Dub421 October 14, 2015 at 12:18   \nJerry Tipton is such a troll. Big Irv October 14, 2015 at 12:20   \nTipton needs to go away. Wonder how many LHL subscriptions have been cancelled due to his buffoonery. I know mine was. October 14, 2015 at 12:35 pm | Permalink \nMine too. Haven’t missed Tipton, Davis or Pett one bit. BAdams October 14, 2015 at 12:25   \nMaybe it’s because everyone has asked a million times and he’s tired of your ridiculous etiquette, Tipton! BenHur October 14, 2015 at 12:26   \nTipton was born without a soul. Tipturd is a Tool October 14, 2015 at 12:33   \nIn fact, he is the biggest tool since the cave men figured out to hit two rocks together to make a sharp edge for scraping meat off a bone. gottodoit October 14, 2015 at 12:36   \nClue me in on the Cal about Skal verus Jerry Tipton sequence. \nDid Tipton ask abut Skal’s eligibility AFTER Cal had already explained it, or did Tipton ask a follow-up question about Skal’s guardian reportedly asking how to get money for a player? \nAt what point did Cal say, “You’re done”? Bourbon Breath October 14, 2015 at 1:01 pm | Permalink \nthe ksr post below this says Skal’s eligibility was the first question of the day and Cal answered it. chimichanga October 14, 2015 at 12:43   \nSay what you want about Tipton and his muckraking ways, but the truth is that he asks tough questions (and some stupid ones, sure). People like that help in holding UK to the high standard we all expect. Louisville doesn’t have anyone like that, and look where they are right now. HackRichards October 14, 2015 at 12:50 pm | Permalink \nDefinitely don’t give that Trash writer credit for anything. IT IS THE NATIONAL MEDIA that holds UK to a higher standard. Dude October 14, 2015 at 1:20 pm | Permalink \nThat’s a great point actually. \nEssentially, checks and balances. Louisville’s lack thereof has led to corruption and deceit. NavyCat October 14, 2015 at 1:28 pm | Permalink \nIf Tipton was a creature of the sea he would be a barnacle, a dung beetle if an insect, a vulture if a bird of the air and a loathsome flea infested rat if a fur bearing animal. As it is, he is a human b**t hole baby living a parasitical life to the detriment of the rest of humanity. Bef to Differ October 14, 2015 at 1:40 pm | Permalink \nYou’re right about the contrast in local media in Lexington and Louisville toward their respective teams but Tipton is perpetually on the prowl for anything damaging or which will put UK in a bad light. Why anyone who is a UK fan still subscribes the LHL defies reason. Leuther October 14, 2015 at 1:46 pm | Permalink \nGood journalists are persistent and ask the hard questions. They don’t just go along to get along. There aren’t many of them left… DavidPat October 14, 2015 at 1:01   \nTippy Toes covers up his lack of talent with overshadowing ignorance of what is actually happening.He spreads crap as if he was making himself a sandwich. Hey, maybe he is! Just an annoying person, an old wet fart if you will…Actually, he probably is doing the best he can? He has been that way for a long long time! Brother Michigan October 14, 2015 at 1:43   \nHey, even if Skal’s guardian did take money, I just head from Cam Newton’s dad that it’s totally OK! I keep forgetting October 14, 2015 at 1:46   \nI keep forgetting that this guy is still working. There can’t be very many people still seeking out and reading his column regularly. \nSpeaking of locals I have lost track of, is Cutler still around? UKfanNKY October 14, 2015 at 1:52   \nJerry Tipton is a PRICK!!!! Good for you Cal. I would ban the sob from all UK pressers!!! Rick Pitino's Half Testicle October 14, 2015 at 1:59   \nSomeone should sack Tipton in a restroom in Rupp and beat the living isht out of him. \nHe’s about a worthless POS. ChicagoCat October 14, 2015 at 3:02   \nFor all saying Tipton is asking the “tough” questions – no he is not. This is a lazy questioned and Tipton got the exact answer he was looking for. If Cal actually had an answer for his question, do you think Cal would actually share it with the media in the middle of an NCAA review? No, and Jerry knows that. The entire purpose of the question was so that Tipton could run to Twitter and claim that Cal “refuses” to answer questions about Skal’s eligibility. Tipton is a troll, not a hard-hitting journalist.
