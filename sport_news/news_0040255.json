Including the playoffs, the Saints have now won 19 of 21 games in the Superdome in prime time.\nMichael Mauti, who grew up near New Orleans after his father, Rich, played for the Saints, blocked a punt and recovered it for a touchdown, delighting the Superdome crowd with a play reminiscent of Steve Gleason’s famous block against Atlanta in 2006. Mark Ingram ran for two short touchdowns, and New Orleans’ defense recovered three fumbles — two inside its own 20.\nDevonta Freeman rushed for 100 yards, including a 25-yard TD, for Atlanta (5-1). Matt Ryan passed for 295 yards and two TDs.\nFreeman also turned a short pass into a 13-yard touchdown, but by then it was too late for the Falcons.\nFreeman’s first touchdown cut New Orleans’ lead to 24-14 with 13:07 remaining, putting pressure on the Saints to answer.\nThe Saints responded with the type of will-imposing drive that was commonplace during much of the decade since coach Sean Payton and Brees arrived in New Orleans, but seldom seen this season.\nNew Orleans drove 80 yards in 11 plays, eating about five minutes off the clock. During the series, Watson tied a career high with his 10th catch of the game. Brees found Brandon Cooks for 26 yards on one third down. Ingram capped the drive by powering in for his second TD to make it 31-14.\nThat wasn’t the only example of the swagger restored to the Saints’ offense. Late in the third quarter, the Saints capped a 10-play, 63 yard drive by first drawing Atlanta offside on fourth-and-goal from the four, then kept the offense on the field and converted a 2-yard pass to Watson.\nThe Saints never trailed, racing in front on the opening series, an 80-yard drive capped by Ingram’s first TD.\nMauti made it 14-0 when he smothered Matt Bosher’s punt attempt, scooped up the ball as he landed and danced into the end zone.\nAtlanta cut it to 14-7 on Ryan’s 7-yard pass to Roddy White, but the Falcons, who outgained the Saints 265-174 in the half, squandered a pair of promising drives with fumbles. First, rookie Tevin Coleman coughed up the ball on a tackle by Jairus Byrd as linebacker Dannell Ellerbe punched the ball out from behind and cornerback Brandon Browner recovered on the 9. Later, Ryan mishandled a snap and Ellerbe recovered on the New Orleans 17.\nAtlanta 0 7 0 14 — 21\nNew Orleans 14 0 10 7 — 31\nFirst Quarter\nNO-Ingram 2 run (Hocker kick), 9:44.\nNO-Mauti 4 blocked punt return (Hocker kick), 2:06.\nSecond Quarter\nAtl-White 7 pass from Ryan (Bryant kick), 14:12.\nThird Quarter\nNO-FG Hocker 31, 7:19.\nNO-Watson 2 pass from Brees (Hocker kick), 2:23.\nFourth Quarter\nAtl-Freeman 25 run (Bryant kick), 13:07.\nNO-Ingram 1 run (Hocker kick), 8:02.\nAtl-Freeman 13 pass from Ryan (Bryant kick), 1:29.\nA-73,018.\nAtl NO\nFirst downs 23 25\nTotal Net Yards 413 385\nRushes-yards 21-150 32-81\nPassing 263 304\nPunt Returns 2-21 2-12\nKickoff Returns 1-19 0-0\nInterceptions Ret. 0-0 0-0\nComp-Att-Int 30-44-0 30-39-0\nSacked-Yards Lost 5-32 1-8\nPunts 4-31.0 4-43.8\nFumbles-Lost 5-3 0-0\nPenalties-Yards 7-41 3-15\nTime of Possession 27:30 32:30\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING-Atlanta, Freeman 13-100, Coleman 4-40, Ryan 4-10.

Bellevue officers said they arrested him because he left the scene of the two-car accident Wednesday evening.\nBellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett said finding out why Coleman left will be a focus of their investigation.\n“Regardless of the reason why, he has a duty to remain at the scene and provide certain information and render aid if he’s able to,” Mylett said.\nColeman’s agents said in a statement “it seems Derrick may have fallen asleep while driving home from a Seahawks’ facility.”\nWitnesses told responding officers that Coleman’s truck was speeding through a 35 mph zone when it rear-ended a Honda Civic, Mylett said. After Coleman was helped from his vehicle, witnesses said, he left.\nOfficers found Coleman two blocks from the crash within 10 minutes based on the descriptions from witnesses. Coleman reported no injuries, while the driver of the other vehicle was taken to a local hospital with serious, non-life-threatening injuries.\nSteve Hayne, one of Coleman’s lawyers, stressed how close his client was to the crash when he was arrested.\n“He didn’t really leave the scene. He was in shock after the accident,” Hayne said. “He didn’t go very far, and he didn’t flee in any sense.”\nHayne also said he talked extensively with Coleman at the Bellevue Police Department a couple hours after the crash and recorded a video of him to demonstrate his state of mind.\n“It’s very clear he was not under the influence of anything,” Hayne said.\nMylett described Coleman as cooperative. He was given field sobriety tests and officers obtained a search warrant to draw blood to screen for drugs and alcohol. Mylett said they were obtaining a warrant to search Coleman’s vehicle.\nThe King County prosecutor’s office said Coleman was expected to make an initial court appearance Friday afternoon. He is being investigated for vehicular assault and felony hit-and-run.\nBellevue police described the accident on Twitter shortly after it happened as a “heavy rescue.” A police photo of the scene showed the Civic on its roof on a steep, grassy embankment and the truck across a hedge, on its side on the roadway below.\nColeman is in his fourth season with the Seahawks. He was on the practice squad in 2012 before making the 53-man roster in 2013. Coleman missed 11 games and the playoffs last season because of a broken foot.\nColeman is legally deaf and his football success has made him an inspirational figure. He has been featured in TV commercials and written a book that was released this year.\nWith Coleman suspended, the Seahawks signed wide receiver B.J. Daniels to take his spot on the active roster.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14813638.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14813638.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14813639.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14813639.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:10:26.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
