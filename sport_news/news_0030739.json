Shortly afterward two high-level managers fled, one bare-chested and the other with his shirt and suit jacket shredded.\nAlexandre de Juniac, the CEO of Air France-KLM, had announced Friday the company would have to cut jobs after failing to reach an agreement with pilots. French media, citing the unions, on Monday reported a proposal to slash 2,900 jobs.\nDe Juniac said the company was being squeezed by low-cost airlines in Europe and Gulf carriers for long-haul flights. Monday's meeting was intended to detail the cuts, which he told Europe 1 radio would be \"significant.\"\nAmong those at Monday's protest was Yves Porte, an activist who represents cargo workers.\n\"At a certain moment, the Gulf companies, who have low fuel prices and who receive government subsidies, compete with us. It's impossible, we are not on a level playing field,\" he said.\nAir France said it would file a complaint for aggravated assault.\nAlthough Monday's scuffle was unusually violent, labor relations in France are commonly testy, with unions sometimes even resorting to holding managers hostage - or \"boss-napping\" - to make a point.\nFrance's transport secretary, Alain Vidalies, condemned the violence, saying in a tweet it was \"unacceptable and must be punished.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
