Their mission is to check on the elderly. Sandra Osby says she joined the team because she's concerned about the safety of the elderly.\n\"I've a very active person and I try to take care of myself. I want to be able to give back to some of the elderly people who can't get around as well as I can,\" said RSVP member Sandra Osby.\nThe group is made up of retired nurses, nuns and paramedics. They went through some intense training. They learned first aid. They viewed crime scenes, graphic images, learned what to do when they come across a crime scene, and talked about scams that target the elderly. Officers say the program is vital to the community for people who live alone or don't have anyone to check on them.\n\"No only does it give them companionship, In a number of situation it's actually helped save a life,\" said Toledo police officer Kathleen Mohr.\n\"They may not be able to get out of their own home frequently. we know at least weekly someone's checking on them and talking to them,\" said Sally Davies with the Area Office on Aging of Northwest Ohio.\nThey also check on homes of people who are on vacation. They don't get any free perks, but they do get satisfaction out of helping to keep the elderly safe.\n\"Making somebody's day just being there for someone being able to help somebody else,\" said Osby.\nThe program has approximately 71 active volunteers.", "external_links": ["http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/461/C4B/461C4B307EF647B7863B1A72BCD6DEA8.mp4", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/RSVP9.jpg", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*197/RSVP9.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:18:11.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
