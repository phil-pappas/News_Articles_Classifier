(Press-Enterprise/Doug Benc) DOUG BENC, DOUG BENC PRESS-ENTERPRISE PHOTO Related article » GRAND TEARRACE – Yes, a win is a win. But Riverside Notre Dame football coach Derrick Johnson also knows what’s looming on his daunting schedule.\nAnd he knows that while his Titans won convincingly Saturday night, defeating Redlands Arrowhead Christian, 33-7, in an Ambassador League game at Grand Terrace High School, he also wants to see more polish, more sharpness and more discipline in the coming weeks.\nNotre Dame is ranked No. 2 in the Northwest Division. It plays No. 4 Ontario Christian next week, and the following Thursday is the big one – No. 1 Temecula Linfield Christian.\n“I think that Notre Dame hasn’t been here in a while,” said Johnson, referring to the team’s success. “We need to regroup, re-focus and take it one play at a time.”\nOn Saturday night, the Titans took control after spotting Arrowhead Christian a 7-6 lead and scored 27 consecutive points. Junior Ian Zamudio ran for 103 yards and a score, junior quarterback Niles Harrell threw for two touchdowns, and the Titans’ defense held ACA to 122 total yards.\nBut Notre Dame (6-0 overall, 1-0 league) also committed 13 penalties for 101 yards and at times looked sloppy, despite 358 yards of total offense. Sloppiness won’t cut it against the Linfields of the world, Johnson figures.\n“I think this team is very special,” he said. “And we need to teach our kids about adversity, and we also need to teach them how to handle success.”\nArrowhead Christian (2-4, 0-1) dropped its fourth consecutive game. Offensively, the Eagles were plagued by two turnovers and six three-and-outs in coach John Beck’s return from knee surgery – he’s been out since the preseason.\nDefensively, they forced some disruptions in the Notre Dame offense and played hard until the end, keeping the game within two scores into the fourth quarter.\n“I’m proud of them,” said Beck, whose team was a section finalist a year ago. “We kind of dug ourselves a hole this season with me being gone, and it’s not going to be an easy hole to climb out of.\n“I’m proud they haven’t given up, and they haven’t given up on each other.”", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw1ij4-b88532117z.120151010221142000gjech1or.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw1ij4-b88532117z.120151010221142000gjech1or.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:30:20.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
