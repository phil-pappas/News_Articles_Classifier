The Cougars trailed 17-3 midway through the second quarter before outscoring the Bearcats 35-7 the rest of the way, including 21-0 in the fourth quarter.\nIt marked the fourth time this season that BYU has rallied from a deficit in the final quarter.\nNow the Cougars are cruising into the softest part of their schedule.\nThey host winless FCS opponent Wagner Saturday (1 p.m., MT, BYUtv) then they have a bye. The Wagner Seahawks (0-6), from Staten Island, New York, fell to Saint Francis last weekend, 43-14.\nThese next two weeks should give BYU a chance to get healthy for the stretch run in November.\nFreshman quarterback Tanner Mangum, who suffered a hamstring injury against East Carolina on Oct. 10, wasn’t 100 percent against Cincinnati. He completed 19 of 32 passes for 252 yards and two touchdowns and an interception.\nMeanwhile, starting offensive linemen Ryker Mathews and Ului Lapuaho are dealing with ankle injuries. Mathews suffered his during the Cincinnati game and Lapuaho injured his ankle against East Carolina and did not play against the Bearcats.\nAnd freshman running back Riley Burt, who rushed twice for 48 yards — including a career-high 41-yarder — injured his hamstring on that long run.\nAfter their bye week, the Cougars visit San Jose State on Nov. 6. Then BYU takes on Missouri of the SEC at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City on Nov. 14.\nOn Nov. 21, the Cougars host Fresno State in their home finale before closing out the regular season on Nov. 28 at in-state rival Utah State. That game against the Aggies looks even more daunting after USU throttled Boise State, 52-26, in Logan last Friday.\nSince the debacle at the Big House, BYU has seen significant improvements on offense, defense and special teams.\nOffensively, the Cougars have scored 85 points in their last two games. BYU has scored 24 times on 25 red-zone drives. Its red-zone scoring percentage (96 percent) is among the best in the country.\nMangum has exhibited poise and moxie this season.\n“He’s a freshman quarterback and people tend to forget that because of how good he’s been playing,” wide receiver Nick Kurtz said of Mangum. “He’s a ballplayer and you expect it every week from him.”\nWhile running back Adam Hine has been out with an injury, Algernon Brown, Francis Bernard and Burt have emerged in recent weeks. Brown has scored six touchdowns in the last two games while Bernard is averaging seven yards per carry.\nThe Cougars are balanced at wide receiver, with Mitch Mathews (33 catches, 393 yards), Devon Blackmon (30 for 374), Mitchell Juergens (27 for 345), Kurtz (23 for 354) and Terenn Houk (20 for 281).\nDefensively, BYU is coming off an eight-sack, 13 tackles-for-loss performance against Cincinnati.\nDefensive lineman Bronson Kaufusi recorded three sacks, three tackles-for-loss and one forced fumble. The Cougars are also benefitting from the return of nose tackle Travis Tuiloma, who is back after suffering a knee injury in the season-opener.\nAs for special teams, Kaufusi had a big field goal block last week, punter Jonny Linehan booted four punts inside the 20-yard line and averaged 47.4 yards per punt on five attempts, including a long of 58 yards. And Garrett Juergens, who started returning punts against ECU, had a career-high 39-yard return that set up BYU’s final touchdown against Cincinnati.\n“It was awesome. That was sweet for our guy Juergs. He was running hard,” Mangum said of Juergen’s return. “It was a whole team effort. I was seeing guys throwing blocks everywhere. That was huge to get us in that position to take a two-possession lead. That was the nail in the coffin almost. It was a turning point. Special teams plays were huge.”\n“Honestly, I knew it was going to happen,” Juergens said. “We had that return called and the last time it was open, but I couldn’t get outside. We called it again and I knew that if I could get outside the first guy, I would have a lot of field to work with.”\nEMAIL: jeffc@deseretnews.com", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:05:15.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
