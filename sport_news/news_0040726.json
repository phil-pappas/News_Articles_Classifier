Both men have denied any wrongdoing.\nAn election delay would give Platini more time to appeal against his 90-day provisional ban. The ban, together with a possible 45-day extension and the length of any appeals process, are seen as major obstacles to his campaign.\nWithout Platini in the field, Ali’s chances of winning could rise significantly. As it stands, the deadline for nominations is Oct. 26 and prospective candidates face a FIFA integrity check.\n“Candidates have had plenty of time to declare and still do. The rules should not be changed after the game has started,” Ali said.\nThe prince, supported at the time by Platini, lost to Blatter in May's presidential election. But Blatter announced four days later that he would lay down his mandate as crisis engulfed FIFA.\nPlatini then dropped his support for Ali and decided to run in February’s vote. He was the favorite before being caught up in the scandal himself.\nAfrican football leader Issa Hayatou is the interim president of FIFA during Blatter's 90-day suspension.\n“The Ethics Committee must now be allowed to do its work in a robust and timely fashion,” Ali said. \"With FIFA’s crisis deepening, the organization needs to move beyond interim leadership and elect an accountable president.\"\n($1 = 0.9570 Swiss francs)\n(Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Tom Heneghan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:39:11.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
