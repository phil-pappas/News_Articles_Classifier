It is those two worlds that will collide Friday in one of the area’s marquee matchups. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Lobrano Field in Mangham. \nSterlington, dropping from No. 1 to No. 6 after a loss to No. 3 Ouachita Christian this week, and Mangham have as much in common with their vaunted rushing attacks as they differ. Both rely on a group of talented running backs and quarterbacks to move the chains. \nSterlington is led by running backs DeVante Douglas (71 carries for 544 yards and eight touchdowns) and quarterback Devin Murphy (133 yards, four TDs). Sterlington (5-1, 0-1) has recently gotten running back Jeffery Griffin back from battling injuries off and on the past two years. \nGriffin rushed for 77 yards and two touchdowns last week in a 21-19 loss to OCS. Sterlington has rushed for 1,481 yards as a team with 10 different players carrying the ball. \n“We have been waiting on (Griffin) to get healthy,” Sterlington coach Jason Thompson said. “Anytime you can keep a fresh set of legs in there it is a weapon.” \nMangham (5-1, 1-0) also uses a “by committee” approach to carry the load of its run heavy offense. Eleven different ball carries have taken the ball for the Dragons — totaling 1,996 yards rushing. \nSenior running back Abdullah Rhone leads the team having rushed for 609 yards and eight touchdowns this season. Junior running back Jakarie Nichols has added 533 yards and eight touchdowns. Two other Dragons have gone over 300 yards rushing including quarterback Kyle Barefield (310 yards, 3 TDs) and Donovan Haynes (364 yards, 5 TDs). \n“You don’t run the ball well if you don’t have talent,” Mangham coach Tommy Tharp said. “I think both teams have that. One thing we do is every position is unique in what they do. We train them for one position when they are coming in. When they become juniors we start learning another of the positions. You may only put in another two more plays.” \nBoth teams also share in a less publicized luxury – big and physical offensive lines that continue to improve week by week. \n“Our offensive line has to be good at what we do,” Tharp said. “If they don’t get it right we aren’t successful.” \n“When those guys are doing well, usually you come out on the right side of things,” Thompson added. “We have to play our assignments. (Mangham) will present a challenge for us.” \nThat challenge includes misdirection and several different styles of option runs the Dragons have blazed a trail to consecutive Class 1A state championship games in recent years. \n“We can’t get caught up in the misdirection,” Thompson said. “We have to go out and play our assignments.” \nConnect with Cody on Twitter @cfutrellTNS or via e-mail cfutrell@thenewsstar.com \n2A No. 6 Sterlington (5-1, 0-1) at 2A Mangham (5-1, 1-0) \nKickoff : 7 p.m. (Lobrano Field) \nRadio: KBYO 92.7 FM (Sterlington) \nWho/What To Watch: Sterlington RB DeVante Douglas has rushed for 544 yards and 8 TDs this season.
