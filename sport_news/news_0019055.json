He also never emerged from the locker room after disappearing in the second quarter.\nThe severity of the injury remains unclear, but remember, Hightower played through a torn shoulder labrum for two months last season. Jerod Mayo and Jonathan Freeny combined to take over Hightower’s duties.\n“High goes out and Mayo comes in,” safety Devin McCourty said. “For us, that’s nothing. Mayo has been in there so many years, so we don’t even think about it.”\nJamie Collins was again the star of the group, though, with 10 tackles, one tackle for loss and one forced fumble against tight end Jason Witten. It was his third forced fumble of the season.\n“Dude is not human, man,” McCourty said of Collins. “He was all over the field today. He made so many plays that he didn’t make on paper, but just his presence of maybe being in the gap. He was all over the place, and that’s coming from me not watching the game. Being in the game, I can feel it. I can’t imagine being able to watch from up top and see all the plays he was able to make.\n“I think his energy was huge today. He was an angry guy out there, and the whole defense fed off it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:13:39.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
