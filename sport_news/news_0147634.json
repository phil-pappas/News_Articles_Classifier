The junior duo combined for just three of the Wildcats’ nine touchdowns, however, as several North Little Rock players were in on the scoring. \nNorth Little Rock picked up its first victory of the season, moving to 1-4 overall and 1-1 in conference play. The Bombers fell to 1-4 and 0-2 and have lost 24 consecutive league games. Mountain Home returns to action Friday when it travels to Little Rock to face the Central High Tigers. \nThrough the first quarter, it appeared the teams were going to be locked in a close battle. Quarterback Corvasea Cooney kept for a touchdown to get the Wildcats on the board, but the Bombers answered with a 15-play, 56-yard drive to pull within 7-6 with 4:00 left in the opening period. \nCord Smith carried six times on the drive, including a 1-yard carry toward the right sideline for a touchdown. Mountain Home forced a North Little Rock punt, but was forced to punt itself. \nOn the first play from scrimmage, Austin sprinted 50 yards for the Wildcats’ second score with 12 seconds left in the quarter, and it was all North Little Rock after that. \nThe Wildcats racked up 527 yards off total offense, including 341 in the first half. Mountain Home netted 165 yards of offense — 84 through the air and 81 on the ground.

Day finished things with a 13-yard touchdown run to make it 34-6 with 2:10 left. \nNorth Little Rock struck with another touchdown pass with 57 seconds remaining to take a 41-6 lead at the halftime break. The Bombers have allowed 68 second-quarter points over their past two games. \nDay scored his second touchdown on a 52-yard scamper, and the clock ran continuously in the second half due to the sportsmanship rule. Ruth scored on a 4-yard run with 2:45 left in the third for a 55-6 lead, and Marcus Christopher added the final touchdown with 3:28 left in the fourth. \nCox passed for 83 yards on four completions for the Wildcats, and Cooney added one completion for 30 yards and four rushes for 57 yards. \nWalker was 15 of 23 passing for 84 yards for the Bombers. The senior quarterback also netted 47 yards on 19 carries. \nMountain Home’s Drew Strope caught six passes for 33 yards, fullback Kolt Kincade caught five passes for 26 yards, Marcus May caught two passes for 15 yards and Payton Parker grabbed two passes for 10 yards. \nSmith rushed for 34 yards on 13 carries for the Bombers, who managed just 67 yards of offense in the second half. \nFor local sports updates, follow Neal Denton on Twitter @BBSportsNeal and Like him on Facebook at facebook.com/BBSportsNeal 5 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/sports/2015/10/02/wildcats-charge-past-bombers/73258480/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:31:21.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
