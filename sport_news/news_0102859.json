Boone Jenner had two goals and Sergei Bobrovsky had 31 saves for the Blue Jackets. Their 0-8-0 start to the season was the worst since the New York Rangers lost their first 11 games in 1943-44. Coach John Tortorella got his first win with Columbus after taking over prior to Thursday's game in Minnesota, replacing fired Todd Richards. The Blue Jackets trailed 3-2 entering the third but tied it on Murray's first goal of the season 3:56 into the period. Dubinsky, who had a goal disallowed in the second, gave Columbus the lead when he scored on a rebound 2:47 after Murray's tally. Jarome Iginla had a goal and an assist for Colorado, which fell to 1-3-1 at home. Semyon Varlamov stopped 32 shots. \nÂ©2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
