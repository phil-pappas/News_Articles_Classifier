The Lakers faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals in 1970, 1972 and 1973.\nGiven that is has been a while since Los Angeles and New York have regularly played each other for something big, we have to wonder how much of a city grudge match there can be.\nNeither city has recently dominated baseball like the St. Louis Cardinals or the San Francisco Giants. There’s no NFL team in Los Angeles (yet), the Lakers and Knicks both have bigger problems than each other, and hockey just resumed and is, well, hockey.\nMoreover, this isn’t even the World Series, but merely the NLDS. And this matchup doesn’t hold the allure of the Dodgers against the more vaunted, and more symbolically New York, Yankees.\nSo while this meeting may give America a reason to pick a side in the Los Angeles-New York fisticuffs, the more interesting Dodgers-Mets backstory lies not in their cities’ differences but in the clubs’ commonalities and entangled histories. There wouldn’t be one without the other.\nThe Dodgers wouldn’t be called the Dodgers, shortened from Trolley Dodgers, without having been born in the trolley car-maze/borough of Brooklyn in 1884. (The club began as the Brooklyn Atlantics in the American Association before taking the name Dodgers in 1911.)\nNine of the 10 retired Dodgers numbers are for players who began their careers as Brooklyn Dodgers. The Mets have retired four numbers, including that of former USC pitcher Tom Seaver and color-barrier-breaking Brooklyn Dodger Jackie Robinson, for whom the rotunda at the Mets’ Citi Field is named.\nHad the Dodgers not left Brooklyn to start the 1958 season in Los Angeles, the New York Metropolitan Baseball Club might have never been born in 1962.\nWithout the Dodgers, the Mets wouldn’t have blue as part of their color scheme. (The Mets’ orange is a tribute to Giants, that other ballclub that left New York for California.)\nBefore 2009, when the Dodgers moved spring training to the Cactus League in Arizona, they had spent 60 years in Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Fla., on the grounds of a former Naval air base. Their closest Grapefruit League playmate from 1988-2008? The Mets in Port St. Lucie.\nThis NLDS is shaping up to be more of a reunion between past and present than a rivalry.\nThe Mets, back in the playoffs for the first time in nine years, last reached the World Series in 2000, losing to the Yankees. The Mets won in 1969 (hoax?) and 1986 and have been more famous for losing in horrendous fashion.\nThe Dodgers, making their third consecutive postseason appearance, haven’t made the World Series since 1988, winning their sixth crown in 17 World Series trips. To get there in 1988, the Dodgers had to beat – guess who? – the Mets, in a seven-game NLCS.\nWhen the 1988 Dodgers, a surprise participant considering their fourth-place 73-89 record in 1987, defeated the Oakland Athletics, legendary Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully made the famous call:\n“They’ve done it like the 1969 Mets! It’s the impossible dream revisited,” he said, referencing the Amazin’ Mets/Miracle Mets’ breakthrough after seven ninth-place finishes in a then-10 team National League, including five 100-loss seasons.\nOn the mound to hurl the final strikeout against Oakland’s Tony Phillips was would-be Cy Young Award winner Orel Hershiser, a Dodger from 1983-94 and again in 2000 but also a Met in 1999.\nAccording to the Ultimate Mets Database (ultimatemets.com), 140 ballplayers have had careers with both teams, notably retired All-Stars Mike Piazza and Darryl Strawberry, Hall of Famers Pedro Martinez and Duke Snider, former-Met-now-Dodger Justin Turner and former-Dodger-now-Met Juan Uribe.\nThe Dodgers wouldn’t be the same without New York. The Mets wouldn’t, well, be without the Dodgers’ move to Los Angeles.\nSo, Los Angeles versus New York? They have needed each other to make baseball history.\nContact the writer: masmith@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:06:12.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
