The video conference lasted approximately 90 minutes.\"\nCook disclosed few details, except to say that the talks were between US defense officials and their counterparts in Moscow and focused on \"steps that can be taken\" by Russian and US-led coalition aircraft \"to promote safe flight operations over Syria.\"\nUS officials were furious after Russia only gave them a vague, verbal \"heads-up\" about an hour before Moscow launched its bombing campaign over Syria on September 30.\nThe two countries had \"deconfliction\" talks the next day via video conference, aimed at ensuring Russian warplanes didn't cross paths with drones and US-led coalition jets targeting the Islamic State extremist group in Syria.\nRussian planes have flown near a US drone, officials say, and the US military has had to reroute some flights to avoid any close calls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:43:00.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
