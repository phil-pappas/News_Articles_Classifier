Both are knockout-round matches. \nBenny Feilhaber raced down the center of the field, and then passed the ball through three defenders to Dwyer. Dwyer shot just outside the 6-yard box and beat diving goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts for his 12th goal of the season. \nSporting KC opened the scoring in the 38th minute. The ball was headed twice before Chance Myers fired a shot on goal. Ricketts blocked the shot with his left foot, but deflected the ball back to Kevin Ellis, who shot went just under the crossbar and into the back of the net. \nFor the Galaxy, Robbie Keane made it 1-1 when he scored in the first minute of first-half stoppage time. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:08:04.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
