(KTTC) - It has been a year fit for a King. The Caledonia Warriors finished the regular season undefeated for the forth time in a row. This year, they did so for the first time with a sophomore under center, Owen King. \n\"He's just an incredible weapon with his arm,\" head coach Brent Schroeder said. \"He has great poise in the pocket, he's made some incredible moves to escape pressure and he's just added a new dimension to our offense.\" \nKing is the first sophomore starting QB at Caledonia since 1995. For a program with such high expectations, Number 3 was happy to have the support of his teammates around him. \n\"I was a little bit nervous to start the year,\" King admitted. \"I mean, I hadn't started a game before but that's how the lineman and wide receivers help. I know that I'm going to be protected as well as anybody and that the wide receivers will make plays for me.\" \nNow that the butterflies are gone, King's confidence continues to grow right alongside his stats. Last week against Chatfield, the QB threw for 194 yards and three touchdowns. King has over 1,000 passing yards this season and has connected on 21 touchdowns, giving him an incredible quarterback rating of 138.1. \n\"The kids don't look at him as a sophomore, they just look at him as another brother,\" coach Schroeder said. \"They don't care what grade you're in, we're all equal. Everybody's one and everybody's helping each other out and it's really starting to show in situations like this.\" \nOwen King may be young but he's old enough to know what playing Warrior's football is really all about. \n\"There's only one goal in Caledonia all the time and that's state championship,\" King said. \"We haven't been there for a couple of years and we'd like to change that.\" Mobile Top Stories More>> Athlete of the week - Owen King CALEDONIA, Minn.
