More than 120 security personnel and hundreds of militants have been killed.\nHurriyet newspaper reported that among those detained on Friday were district officials of the Peoples Democratic Party (HDP), a pro-Kurdish party which the government accuses of having links with the hardline PKK.\nAn HDP spokesman had no immediate information on the arrests. There was also no comment from Turkish police.\nHDP district officials have been detained in previous police raids in southeastern Turkey as well. The HDP accuses the government of seeking to punish it for its success in the inconclusive June election that deprived the ruling Islamist-rooted AKP of its single-party majority in parliament.\nAmong the 44 people arrested were union members and former district mayors, Turkish media reported.\nIn the predominantly Kurdish southeastern city of Diyarbakir, security sources said police had imposed a curfew in the Silvan neighbourhood where two soldiers were shot dead by suspected PKK militants on Thursday as they left for work.\nThe renewed hostilities have wrecked efforts to establish a long-term peace, and have sparked some of the worst recent clashes in the 29-year-old PKK insurgency.\nDeemed a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and European Union, the PKK launched its armed campaign for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey in 1984. The conflict has cost more than 40,000 lives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:25:35.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
