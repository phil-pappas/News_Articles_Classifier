They were at the team's indoor practice facility for a portrait on Jan. 5, 2015. ( Cyrus McCrimmon, The Denver Post ) Bronco Bus fan forum \nAqib Talib often refers to Chris Harris as his little brother. It has been that way since their playing days at the University of Kansas. \nTalib was the star cornerback as a junior, well on his way to becoming the Jayhawks' first first-round pick in 15 years. Harris was just a two-star recruit who came to the only Division I-A school that offered him a scholarship. He wasn't even supposed to play early, but injuries forced him into action. \nStill, Talib saw Harris' talent from the start and took the 17-year-old under his wing in the one year they spent together in college. \nThat was 2007. Now, eight years later, the relationship is similar. The main difference is Harris' talent level has caught up. \nAnd like a little brother, Harris is always on a mission to one-up his big brother, Talib. \nThe two may well be the best cornerback duo in the NFL , but neither is eager to concede any ground to the other. \n\"It's going to be a battle. It's going to be a race for the most pick-sixes this year,\" Harris said after being asked about Talib's 63-yard interception return for a touchdown against Cleveland on Oct. 18. \nTalib has two pick-sixes this season. Harris has one. Let the battle ensue. \nThat sort of internal competition is a staple on the Broncos' defense. Advertisement \n\"Everybody wants to be better than everybody else,\" safety Omar Bolden said. \"When you have 11 guys who want to be the best, want to make a play, it just makes the defense as a whole better.\" \nThat's why guys such as outside linebackers Shaquil Barrett and Shane Ray are able to make plays when Von Miller or DeMarcus Ware aren't in the game. And it's why the Broncos have 12 different players responsible for the team's NFL-leading 26 sacks. \nThere are no set playmakers on this defense, because everyone has the potential to be a playmaker. Nearly every defensive starter has played a major role in the Broncos' 6-0 record by making a play in the fourth quarter or overtime to halt an opponent's comeback drive. Even key reserves such as cornerback Bradley Roby, safety David Bruton and Barrett, who all would probably be starters on a lesser defense, have changed the game for their team. \nSafety T.J. Ward said two weeks ago the team has a \"put the names in the hat\" mentality when it comes to who is going to make that turnover, make that sack, make that fourth-down stop. \n\"We have a bunch of hungry guys,\" Bruton said. Denver Broncos safety T.J. Ward celebrates a sack in the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Oct. 5, 2015. ( Steve Nehf, The Denver Post ) \nComing into Week 7, the Broncos were in the top seven in the NFL in every important defensive category: points per game, total yards, rushing yards, passing yards, sacks, interceptions, forced fumbles, total turnovers and third-down percentage. \nThe numbers are clear: Denver has an elite defense, a unit that is eager to keep the gas to the pedal after the bye week. \n\"I still don't think that we're getting all the love that we should get,\" Miller said. \"We play Green Bay, 'Sunday Night Football,' prime time. We'll be able to prove our point.\" \nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe Get sports news and updates right in your inbox \nSign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:25:04.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
