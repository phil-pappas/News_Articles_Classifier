In February, France provided Egypt with three Dassault Aviation-built Rafale fighters, the first of 24 warplanes sold in a 5.2 billion euro ($5.6 billion) deal.\nLast month, Egypt’s Army Chief of Staff chief Lieutenant General Mahmoud Hegazy visited with top British officials in the UK to discuss military cooperation.\nThis year the British government has, according to media reports in July, increased its supply of arms to Egypt after reducing them temporarily following the 2013 ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.\nIn July, the US delivered eight F-16 airplanes to Cairo, with four more expected to be delivered in autumn. It also delivered five M1A1 Abrams tank turrets to Egypt in August. Both deliveries are part of the $1.3 billion in military aid that the US provides Egypt annually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:15:43.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
