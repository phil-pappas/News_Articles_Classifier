Manohar Lal Khattar has outshone himself on that count. Be it ‘gai pe charcha’, new school book prototypes in the dubious Dinanath Batra laboratory, a lukewarm response to attacks on Dalits and Muslims or remarks on how communities and women should behave, he has aggressively pushed his core beliefs in his first year in office. In doing all this, he has let down the people who gave the BJP an unprecedented mandate for change. Contentious and polarising issues have been willfully allowed to dictate the discourse, putting at risk the delicate communal balance. As against this maximalist approach, Team Khattar's interventions on administrative matters have been minimalistic. An apparent lack of trust in institutions, and those manning it, is not a governance model that reflects a hope of new beginnings. Khattar, to his credit, is untainted by charges of corruption, but promises of accountability and administrative rigour have been lost in the showmanship of symbolism. The routine ranting of ministerial colleagues is an indication of the extent of control the Chief Minister wields. Khattar can claim the benefit of the doubt in this having been the BJP's first year in power, that too for the first time ever in the state. His bizarre comment on Muslims and beef should come as a realisation that such privileges are not the refuge of political rulers. Things said and done demand ownership. Fortunately for the Chief Minister, he has time on his side. That is if he chooses to change track, away from the trumpeting of “achievements”. What’s expected from him is initiating more such steps as making the government job selection process transparent by doing away with or reducing the marks for interviews. It is easy to fritter away the gains of a decisive mandate. The BJP, which for decades was in oblivion in Haryana, would surely know how majority governments can lose public support. The time for course correction is here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:09:26.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
