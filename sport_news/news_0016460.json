The southbound on-ramp from the Moda Center will stay open until 11 p.m. The exit to eastbound Interstate 84 will stay open, according to the press release. The highway is expected to re-open by 10 a.m. on Saturday.\nAt 10 p.m. Saturday, the same southbound I-5 section will close and re-open at 11 a.m. Sunday. The on-ramp from the Moda Center will remain open until midnight.\nFurther south, interstate on-ramps and the two lanes will be intermittently closed as crews paint stripes on the road between the Marquam Bridge and exit 294.
