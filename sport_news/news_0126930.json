She set a record for most women's World Cup wins and earned her seventh downhill season title.\nThe American, who turned 31 Sunday, said her priority was to avoid any risks of hurting herself again.\n\"If the snow conditions were different my decision would have been different as well,\" she said. \"But at this stage in my career I suppose it's better to err on the side of caution.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:01:47.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
