And while that may be true in many cases, a new analysis by the careers website Glassdoor finds that tech and engineering jobs are among the best-ranked careers for workers who want to find some kind of balance between their professional and personal lives.\nOn Tuesday, Glassdoor released its list of the 25 jobs that had the highest rating for work-life balance over the past year from workers who filled out reviews on its site. Reviewers rate their jobs on a scale of one to five, with a \"one\" being dissatisfaction with the amount of balance in their lives and a \"five\" being something akin to work-life nirvana.\nAmong the 25 jobs listed, roughly half are engineering jobs or careers with a big technology component, ranging from software engineers to Web designers. That could be because the tech-driven nature of those jobs allows them to be done anywhere, or exist in companies with more generous policies toward remote work or unconventional hours. Higher salaries and more job openings - which give employees more control over their careers and the ability to negotiate for better working conditions - could also play a role in helping those careers end up on the list.\nTraditionally flexible jobs such as substitute teaching, meanwhile, make up only a small part of the list.\nFor a job title to be considered for Glassdoor's report, they had to have at least 75 work-life balance ratings from a minimum of 75 companies over the past year, as well as include \"work-life balance\" or similar terms as a \"pro\" of the job in at least 15 percent of reviews. The job titles also had to have at least 200 active job openings to be considered.\nWhile people in these careers may think their lives are relatively balanced in today's 24/7 work world, overall, work-life balance has decreased in recent years, according to Glassdoor's data. In 2009, people reported an average rating of 3.5, which fell to 3.4 in 2012 and 3.2 so far in 2015.\n10 best jobs for long-term success Davild Muhlbaum As baby boomers retire and leave the job market, younger generations will have better employment opportunities.
