I think you'll see a more aggressive Jimmy, similar to how he played that first game, the rest of the preseason.\"\nThree games remain, including a back-to-back set that starts Monday in Charlotte. In a nod to that back-to-back, Hoiberg said Pau Gasol will either rest completely or be limited after his busy summer and veteran status.\nTony Snell participated at full speed in half of Sunday's practice, and a determination whether he'll return from his sprained left ankle will be made Monday. Derrick Rose again participated in the non-contact portions of practice and traveled to Charlotte but won't play and is expected to miss all eight exhibitions.\n\"He still has a little bit of blurry vision when he opens that eye,\" Hoiberg said. \"So a lot of times he's out there with one eye closed. We don't want him to go out there and jar something or get hurt.\"\nAs for Butler, his breakout season that led to his first All-Star appearance and Most Improved Player hardware featured Tom Thibodeau isolating him often and calling multiple set plays for him. Hoiberg's offense is predicated more on dribble handoffs and read-and-react actions.\nDoes Hoiberg think Butler is still acclimating himself to his offense?\n\"Yeah, maybe,\" Hoiberg said. \"I'm trying to get him in a lot of live ball-screen situations where he comes off a cut and gets the ball where he and Pau or he and Jo (Noah) get a two-man game going. Obviously, he was great at that in our first game against Milwaukee. He made a lot of plays.\"\nHoiberg also said the Bulls, like most teams, haven't unveiled their full playbook yet.\nButler wasn't made available to answer questions Sunday but said recently he isn't concerned about his offensive downturn since the opener.\n\"Not at all,\" he said. \"Just gotta continue to take the right shots. It will turn around. I know I put in the work. Keep taking the shots and they'll fall. Keep getting in the paint. But more than anything, I have to keep making the right play.\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1739825&h=As+season+nears%2C+Bulls%27+Jimmy+Butler%27s+aggressiveness+to+pick+up", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1739825", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1739825&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:40:05.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
