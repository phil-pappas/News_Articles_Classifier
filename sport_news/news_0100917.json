Stegall and his unbeaten Reinhardt teammates are favored to win their final conference crossover Saturday afternoon at winless Bluefield. Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow Reinhardt will look to continue its undefeated season when the No. 14 Eagles travel to West Virginia to face winless Bluefield in their final Mid-South Conference crossover game Saturday.Reinhardt (4-0) enters with its highest ranking and longest winning streak to start a season in team history, but the wins have not come easy. The Eagles have had to come back in the second half in each of their last two games, including a comeback from a 21-0 second-quarter deficit against Pikeville last week.While the starts are not ideal, coach Drew Cronic said there are some positives that can be taken away from his team’s ability to come back. “It was nice to come back and win a game like we did,” he said. “The players can always file that away in their minds as a reminder that we’re never out of it. We have the ability to come back, so it’s good to be able to prove to yourself that we’re capable of doing that. Obviously, we would like to have a better start than we had, but we proved we can still win when we don’t.”Cronic said one of the major points of emphasis in practice this week was starting the game better, but there is only so much preparation that can be done for that. Most of the pressure will fall on the execution of the players.“We try to put together a good game plan,” Cronic said. “We want to make sure we’re sharp, we have a good game plan going in and we make good adjustments at the half. Sometimes, it doesn’t work that way, and you have to make adjustments and catch up. We want to focus on that, but, at the same time, we know to hang in there and keep playing.”Bluefield (0-5) relies on a dynamic running attack that has produced three different 100-yard rushers this season, so the Reinhardt defense, which gave up 236 rushing yards against Pikeville, will have to play assignment football and tackle well.Bluefield also has a lot of size on its offensive and defensive fronts, though Reinhardt deploys a dynamic rushing attack of its own to make up for a lack of size.“We’re trying to pride ourselves on being in better shape, and our kids have really bought into that,” Cronic said. “You hope you can keep people off-balance, tire them out a little bit and make them play a little slower. We’re going to be the smallest team in every game we play most likely, so, hopefully, you can run their big guys around a little bit and give yourself a better opportunity as the game goes on.”Last week, Reinhardt had five players carry the ball at least five times, and the well-dispersed workload worked wonders as the Eagles’ tempo wore down Pikeville late in the game. Cronic plans to spread the ball around again Saturday, taking advantage of one of the Eagles’ greatest strengths.“We have some backs,” Cronic said. “L.J. (Stegall) and Niagel (Curtis) are always there for us. Obviously, Sam Jones and Deonte Dennis can do some good things, too. Ryan Thompson has played solid as well. It’s really nice that we have a couple backs we can count on. We just have to get them in space and get them an opportunity, and they’ll produce.”As Reinhart’s final conference crossover game before it moves into West Division play, the Eagles will look to carry some momentum into the games that count.“I think it’s a huge game,” Cronic said. “I think each week grows off the previous week, and you want to keep your edge. I think it’s important that we play well in this game, especially getting into some of the teams we’re getting ready to play. We need to play well this game weekend to keep moving forward.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:14:25.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
