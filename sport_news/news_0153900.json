Smooth sailing: Celina enters District 3-4A action with 5-0 record Chris O'Dell, codell@starlocalmedia.com Star Local Media | 0 comments \nCelina entered Friday’s non-district finale against Melissa with a 4-0 record and four double-digit victories. \nThe Bobcats continued that streak by remaining perfect heading into District 3-4A action, earning a dominant 53-13 victory behind a balanced offensive attack. \n“Our kids have done great so far,” said Bill Elliott, Celina head coach. “We accomplished what we wanted to [in non-district].” \nCelina tallied more than 500 yards of total offense, including 247 on 45 carries. \n“We’re fortunate to have several guys that we can spread it around with,” Elliott said. \nLeading the offensive attack was junior quarterback Conner Pingleton, who completed 13-of-18 passes for 244 yards and one touchdown. The dual-threat signal caller also added a team-high 86 yards and another score on seven carries. \n“[Pingleton] is seeing the field really well,” Elliott said. \nSophomore Ismael Ortiz chipped in another 81 yards and two touchdowns on a team-high 11 carries, while senior Luke Reeder became Pingleton’s primary target in the passing game by hauling in five receptions for 98 yards and a 26-yard touchdown. \n“We knew we had a lot of experience coming back on offense,” Elliott said. \nThe Bobcats will now have the benefit of a bye week to prepare for an Oct. 9 district opener at Anna. \n“We’re using this week to get our guys fresh and ready to go,” Elliott said. \nThe Bobcats steamrolled their way through the district last season en route to a 5-0 mark that saw the team outscore its 3-4A opponents by a combined score of 265-26. If that dominance continues this season, Celina will begin its playoff run with a perfect record for the first time since 2011. The Bobcats reached the regional finals that season before a 42-19 loss to Henderson ended the team’s season with an 11-1 mark. \n“We’ve been trying to figure out our strengths and weaknesses so far,” Elliott said. “I think we were able to do that.” \nFor the season, Pingleton has completed 65-of-96 passes for 1,177 yards, 11 touchdowns and no interceptions while adding a team-high 392 yards and four scores on 45 carries. Senior running back Jarren Alexander has stayed fresh by racking up 369 yards and five touchdowns on only 51 attempts. \nLeading an experienced group of receivers has been senior Riley Nebeker, who has caught 15 passes for 350 yards and four touchdowns. \nFor continued news and coverage on the local sports scene, follow @cODellSCN on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:28:36.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
