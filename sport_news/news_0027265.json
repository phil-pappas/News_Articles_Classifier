But after the game, coach James Franklin and his players lamented mistakes and missed opportunities more than the offense itself. \nHere's a look at how Penn State viewed the game. \n'WE'RE A MUCH BETTER TEAM THAN WE PUT ON FILM' \nSeveral players said that Franklin's post-game message concerned Penn State beating itself. A dropped pass and a holding penalty on Penn State's second series negated a touchdown drive and a potential 10-0 lead. \nNegative-yardage plays stalled momentum on some drives and forced the team into third-and-longs. And the defense didn't adapt well to Ohio State's quarterback change from Cardale Jones to J.T. Barrett.

Basically, what we took away is that we're a much better team than what we showed today.\" \n\"We're a much better team than we put on film,\" defensive end Carl Nassib said. \n\"I think we left some opportunities on the field,\" quarterback Christian Hackenberg said. \"The result is a little bit skewed on the scoreboard.\" \nON PLAYING HACKENBERG LATE \nThe quarterback clearly was struggling with a lower-body injury after being hit in the second quarter. He threw just four passes in the second half, two on Penn State's touchdown drive to open the third quarter.

Though the quarterback was sacked five times and had trouble moving in the pocket, he remained in the game down 21 points in the fourth quarter. A sack-fumble sequence led to the Buckeyes' final toudhdown. \nHackenberg's seven completions were a career-low. \n\"He got banged up,\" Franklin said. \"We asked the doctors if he was good to go, they said he was good to go. We're going to play, no different than [Ohio State]. Late in they game, they had [defensive end Joey] Bosa and their starting defense in there. We're still playing football to win.\" \nPUNTERS WANTED \nPenn State ranked 84th nationally in net punting entering the game, a number that should fall after Saturday. Punters Chris Gulla and Daniel Pasquariello combined to average 35.9 yards per attempt and put just one inside the Ohio State 20-yard line. \nWith Cameron Johnston averaging 41.6 yards per attempt, the Buckeyes held the field-position edge most of the game. \n\"We've had major issues for two years with punting the ball,\" Franklin said. \"The way we need to play right now, which is play great on defense, find ways to grind it our on offense and play field position, we haven't been able to do that for two years. If we need to have open tryouts, weâ€™re going to have to find a way to solve that problem.\" \nFOURTH-AND-TWO EXPLAINED \nFranklin liked the fourth-quarter play call on fourth-and-two from the Ohio state 13-yard line. Hackenberg had four passing options, the last of which was running back Saquon Barkley. \nThough Barkley looked wide open in the backside flat, Franklin said it wasn't feasible for Hackenberg to find him. Instead, Hackenberg took a sack. The Buckeyes responded with an 85-yard scoring drive to extend their lead to 31-10. \n\"[Ohio State] kept getting push and getting pressure,\" Franklin said. \"For christian to think he's getting back to the fourth progression on a three-step drop, that's probably not going to happen.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:56:41.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
