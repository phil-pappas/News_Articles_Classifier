Meanwhile, on an equally ambitious level, the Utah State Aggies revealed a galactic plan of their own: to rule the Mountain West Conference and earn a “New Year’s Six” bowl invitation.\nImprobable as that sounds, suddenly it doesn’t seem 141 million miles away.\nThe first step was getting the call from the Mountain West Conference, which happened. The next step was to rise to the new level of competition. No problem. The Aggies finished 7-1 in conference in 2013, winning their division and upsetting Northern Illinois in the Poinsettia Bowl. Last year they went 6-2 in conference and won their bowl game.\nFriday, they got off to a quick jump on Step 3: Beating Boise State — after 12 consecutive losses — and winning the Mountain West.\nSo the Aggies undressed their old nemesis, forcing seven first-half turnovers. The margin got as wide as 35 in the second half.\nYes, they were on a different planet.\nFor one night at Maverik Stadium, they made much-respected BSU look like Boise Junior College — which it was, not so long ago. Boise’s dream is to reach a power conference. That depends on academic reputation, athletic accomplishments, marketability, market size and the vagaries of conference realignment.\nOn the field, the Broncos have won or tied for 12 of their last 15 conference championships.\nUSU? It packed 12 games and 18 years of frustration into one nutty half. If anything, the four-helicopter pregame flyover should have signaled something unusual. In the first quarter alone there was a 38-yard punt return (BSU), a 51-yard pass completion (USU), a 51-yard field goal (USU), two forced fumbles and two recoveries (USU).\nOtherwise, nothing happened.\nIt took all of 31 seconds for the Aggies to score in the second quarter, putting them up 24-3. Three additional minutes yielded another pickoff, triggering an enthusiastic rendition of “The Scotsman,” an Aggie fight song, ending in the lyrics:\nWho doesn’t love the spot \nWhere the sagebrush grows? \nTalk about apropos.\nThe nation’s No. 21 team comes to Logan and what does it find?\nA sagebrush rebellion.\nThe Aggies scored 21 points in the last 85 seconds of the first half, then forced a fumble early in the third quarter, making it eight turnovers for the Broncos.\nIt’s hard not to peek, though USU is still far from its ultimate goal of championships and major bowls. It first would have to win the conference, then get a premier bowl invitation, despite already having two losses.\nThat’s a big stretch for a “mid-major” program.\nBut the Broncos did that last year.\nIn one sense, it should have come as no surprise that Friday’s game was a blowout. Few of the USU-BSU games have been close. Last year it was 50-19, Broncos. The year before was the closest matchup in decades, with BSU winning 34-23. But in the previous five meetings Boise won by an average of 38 points.\nSo every year, USU schedules two games that mesmerize their fans like no other: BYU and Boise.\nBeating BYU does their hearts good. But beating Boise State will also make their profile soar. Because the Broncos have been to three Fiesta Bowls, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out the formula: Dominate your conference and the glamour bowls might call.\n“It’s not the championship game,” USU coach Matt Wells said beforehand, “but it’s a big game and basically puts the winner in the driver’s seat.”\nWith the sunroof open.\nThus, the Aggies finally knocked the Broncos off their high horse by displaying the kind of defense that championship teams use and ignoring the intimidation factor. That kind of confidence can unexpectedly take a decent team to some distant places. It marked the 58th time in history USU has played a ranked team. Only five of those have been wins, though four have come in the last seven tries.\nSo for a few hours on Friday, the Aggies’ plan didn’t seem quite so far off. It might not have been a walk on Mars, but it was nothing less than a moon shot.\nEmail: rock@desnews.com ; Twitter: @therockmonster; Blog: Rockmonster Unplugged", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:31:35.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
