Merritt, lacking the beard he had when arrested and with his head newly shaven, said nothing in court except his name and date of birth.\nEach of the four shootings that Merritt is charged with carries a possible sentence of 20 to 30 years, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said Wednesday. But prosecutors cautioned it was too early to predict sentencing or the outcome of a trial, and a defense attorney for Merritt said a prison term of more than 100 years \"is a theoretical possibility only.\"\n\"There's no practical likelihood of it ever happening,\" attorney Jason Lamm told Phoenix news station KNXT-TV in a live interview Thursday ( http://goo.gl/pYWyL9 ).\nMontgomery still called the arrest significant enough that the public can rest easier.\n\"It appears to be the person who initiated what was going on at that time,\" Montgomery said. \"We haven't had any incidents since then.\"\nLamm, one of two newly hired attorneys, told The Associated Press on Wednesday he has not had a chance to review any police reports or other evidence against his client.\n\"We're looking for the truth, and there is no stone that will be left unturned to find it,\" Lamm said.\nMerritt was arrested Sept. 18 at a Wal-Mart in Glendale. Using ballistics tests, Arizona Department of Public Safety detectives tied him to four of the 11 shootings that occurred on Phoenix-area freeways between Aug. 22 and Sept. 10. Investigators continue to review information, and more charges are possible, Montgomery said.\nThe investigation into the other shootings remains open. Eight cars were hit with bullets, and three were struck with projectiles such as BBs or pellets, most while driving along Interstate 10, according to authorities. The only injury was to a 13-year-old girl whose ear got cut by glass on Aug. 29.\nMerritt's arrest brought relief to some after Gov. Doug Ducey announced it on Twitter. His tweet saying, \"We got him!\" drew criticism for seemingly implying that Merritt was guilty.\nMontgomery said the governor's tweet was not an issue in Merritt's ability to get a fair trial.\n\"Unless there were 6 million followers of that Twitter account, I don't think you can fairly say everyone was aware of it or could be impacted by it,\" Montgomery said.\nThe tweet illustrated the high emotion surrounding the case, Lamm said.\n\"Nevertheless, we will handle this from an objective assessment of the facts and evidence as opposed to hunches and emotion,\" he said. \"By the way, Doug Ducey will not be on my jury. So I feel better about that.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
