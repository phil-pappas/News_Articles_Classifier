The two-time NBA champion landed on Skid Row, a regular tabloid target.\nThen he seemed to drop out altogether before he was found unresponsive in a brothel and hospitalized, bringing his estranged wife, his former teammates and the world's attention back to his side Wednesday.\nHospital authorities would not comment on the condition of the 35-year-old former NBA forward, but the Rev. Jesse Jackson was among his visitors Wednesday. Jackson said Odom was on life support and improving.\n\"Apparently from what the doctor said, he was much better off today than yesterday. He at least has some responsiveness now,\" Jackson said. \"He's got tubes in him now, but we felt inspired by his presence.\"\nOdom, who was embraced by teammates and television fans alike for his Everyman approach to fame, was found face-down and alone Tuesday after spending four days at the Love Ranch, a legal Nevada brothel.\nLamar Odom's life has long been laced with tragedy Christine Mai-Duc Even before Lamar Odom was found unresponsive in a Nevada brothel Tuesday, the former Lakers champion and Clippers player had been repeatedly touched by losses that cut him so deeply he once contemplated quitting basketball.\n“Death always seems to be around me,” Odom told the Los Angeles Times...\nEven before Lamar Odom was found unresponsive in a Nevada brothel Tuesday, the former Lakers champion and Clippers player had been repeatedly touched by losses that cut him so deeply he once contemplated quitting basketball.\n“Death always seems to be around me,” Odom told the Los Angeles Times...\n(Christine Mai-Duc) Odom started \"throwing up all kinds of stuff\" after a 911 operator told them to turn him on his side, Love Ranch owner Dennis Hof told The Associated Press in a phone interview. Odom had \"spent time socializing with some of my girls,\" but wasn't seen taking any illegal drugs, Hof said.\nIn a recording of a 911 call, Hof's spokesman Richard Hunter said Odom was breathing but in a \"deep sleep\" and had fluid coming from his nose and mouth.\n\"He sounds like he's snoring a little bit. But he is breathing consistently,\" Hunter said.\nIt was Odom's first visit to the Love Ranch, and he told employees he did cocaine before he arrived Saturday, Hunter said.\nOdom also took up to 10 tabs of an over-the-counter sexual performance enhancer over the course of his stay, Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said at a news conference. Sheriff's Detective Michael Eisenloffel described the enhancers as supplements and said Odom bought them at the brothel.\nA review of Lamar Odom's career, beginning with his days as a Clipper and continuing through his stops with the Lakers and Mavericks.\nWith a search warrant, authorities took a blood sample from Odom early Wednesday to determine what was in his system. The results could take weeks, Eisenloffel said.\nOdom spent most of his 14-year NBA career in Los Angeles with the Lakers and Clippers, becoming a fan favorite before he sought even more fame with the Kardashians.\nHis one-month courtship of Khloe before their huge 2009 wedding was taped for the E! network, and Odom appeared on nearly two dozen episodes of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" as well as other family spinoffs, including his own \"Khloe & Lamar\" show in 2011 and 2012.\nKhloe Kardashian called him \"Lam-Lam\" and worried openly about him on the show. Even after they split in 2013, cameras recorded her calling him and checking on his welfare.\nPeople always seemed to root for Odom, whose prematurely weathered face wore the impact of his personal tragedies in a friendly way. And news of his hospitalization brought an outpouring of dismay and encouragement from his friends and family.\nKobe Bryant joined Kardashian and some of Odom's childhood friends at his bedside after a Tuesday night Lakers game in Las Vegas.\n\"I'm obviously hoping that he can pull through this, and that in some fortunate way this becomes the beginning of a different ending,\" said Derek Fisher, the New York Knicks coach and Odom's longtime teammate with the Lakers.\nEven his once-estranged father, Joe Odom, was at the hospital, according to his grandmother, Florence Odom.\nAuthorities were called to the Crystal, Nevada, brothel at about 3:15 p.m. Tuesday. The 6-foot-10 Odom was too tall for an available helicopter, so he was driven by ambulance to Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center in Las Vegas.\nIn a statement, Hof, the brothel owner, said: \"He largely kept to himself, and at no time did he engage in any drug use in the presence of anyone in the house. He did drink alcohol from our bar, and was taking some herbal sexual enhancement capsules.\"\nHunter added Love Ranch workers are trained to \"stop the party\" if drugs are seen, and Odom was aware of the brothel's strict anti-drug policy.\nOdom was staying in its \"best VIP suite\" on an open-ended reservation, and was accompanied by two women, Hunter said. He spent an amount beyond five figures, which would have been negotiated privately between the women and Odom, he said. The prostitutes are independent contractors who get 50 percent of the price.\nOdom emerged as one of the most promising basketball talents of his generation after a difficult childhood in Queens, where his mother died of cancer when he was 12 and his estranged father was addicted to heroin. Drugs and crime were rampant in his South Jamaica neighborhood, and he never forgot where he came from, writing tributes to his mother and grandmother on his sneakers before games.\nTall enough to play center and skilled enough to be a playmaking guard, the rangy kid with a beautiful shot and exceptional ball-handling skills drew comparisons to Magic Johnson when he played on a traveling youth team alongside Ron Artest, his future Lakers teammate.\nDespite an abbreviated college career marked by scandal and an arrest in Las Vegas, Odom's talent was so coveted that he was picked fourth in the 1999 NBA draft by the moribund Clippers. Suddenly, he was \"living like a 19-year-old rock star,\" he said.\nSoon after, he was suspended for smoking marijuana.\nOdom had two children during those years, Destiny and Lamar Jr., with an ex-girlfriend, Liza Morales. The 2006 crib death of another infant son, Jayden, attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, prompted Odom to consider quitting basketball. He played the next season displaying a T-shirt bearing his son's photo in his locker.\nOdom loved wearing purple and gold, and his selfless play won him the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. He won a second straight NBA title in 2010 while playing alongside Artest, now known as Metta World Peace.\nBut his basketball career faded as his life became a spectacle. He was heartbroken in December 2011 when the Lakers attempted to trade him; he eventually landed in Dallas, where reality TV crews followed.\n\"The year he got traded people wanted to say, 'Oh, it's because of the show.' No one wanted to bring up the accomplishments he had when we were filming,\" Khloe Kardashian told the AP in a 2013 interview.\nStill, Odom's behavior increasingly worried family and friends. He pleaded no contest to drunk driving after an arrest in August 2013. Kardashian filed for divorce four months later and has been dating Houston Rockets star James Harden. The divorce has not yet received final approval from a judge.\nWhen cameras caught up with Odom on a sidewalk in August, he blamed the media for his downfall.\n\"Y'all have discredited me, beat me down, took my confidence, took everything away from me. You will not do it again,\" Odom told TMZ in an interview. \"To everybody that I know and that supports me, I'm sorry but it's just it. The dog has to bite back.\"\nAssociated Press\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Lamar Odom NBA Crime Khloe Kardashian Los Angeles Lakers Los Angeles Clippers Metta World Peace", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ea2eb/turbine/ct-lamar-odom-life-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e9b1a/turbine/la-me-lamar-odom-20111211-pg", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561f8ccb/turbine/ct-lamar-odom-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:06:58.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
