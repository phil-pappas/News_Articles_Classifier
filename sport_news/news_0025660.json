Delon Wright and James Johnson had 11 points each for Toronto.\nBennett, a 6-foot-8 forward, has never really found his groove thanks to a series of injuries and the numbers game that often impacts NBA playing time. He had shoulder woes in Cleveland in his rookie season — a holdover from his college career at UNLV and was hurt again last season in Minnesota.\nDespite Bennett’s lofty draft status, the NBA doesn’t have much time to wait on some young players and jobs lost are sometimes hard to get back.\n“For a young player, that’s tough with a lot of high expectations,” said Mitchell.\n“It was just unfortunate that he got injured early and then when you get injured and you’re working your way back in, it’s tough to do.”\nIt’s doubly tough when the critics howl and confidence wanes. Those who have been around him the most this summer agree the best thing for Bennett would be to rediscover his enjoyment of the game and to forget the harping that’s followed him since his rookie season.\nThat’s far easier said than done in this age of near constant media scrutiny but it could be a key to Bennett thriving in the NBA.\n“Criticism is hard for young players, when people doubt you,” Rivers said. “I always say that when guys come in the league, they’ve never been criticized like that when people don’t think they’re that good. They’ve always been great so some handle it well and some don’t. I think he’ll find his way, he’s home, he’s probably in more comfortable surroundings so I think it’ll help him.”\nZack Greinke will try to complete Dodgers’ comeback", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:06:42.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
