With its homecoming spoiled, Chicago fell to 5-2, 4-2. \nPeters and Dayton Winn led the Warriors to 597 yards in total offense. Peters, a junior from Greenbrier, completed 17 of 26 passes for 318 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Winn ran 33 times for 197 yards and a touchdown. \nChandler Marquardt stopped a fourth-quarter drive by the Maroons with an interception. Jake Brantley had 10 tackles with an interception. John Donald had eight tackles and Tyler Clifton added seven bills and a sack. Clifton and Brantley were both involved in the fourth-down stop on Chandler Carroll at the Hendrix 1 in the fourth quarter. \nThe Warriors jumped to a 13-0 lead on a 54-yard pass from Peters to Ben Luedtke (8:07 first quarter) and a 14-yard pass from Peters to Ethan Hoppe with 1:27 left in the first. The drives were 85 yards in 12 plays and 64 yards in 12 plays, respectively \nAfter Chicago drew with 13-7 on a 43-yard pass from Burke Moser to Sam Coleman. \nHendrix then drove 65 yards to Winn’s 3-yard run to take a 20-7 lead with 8:35 left in the half. \nA 20-yard pass from Chanlder to Nathan Massey drew the Maroons within 20-14 with 1:22 left in the third quarter. \nEarly in the fourth quarter, Peters connected with Winn on a 74-yard touchdown pass to give the Warriors a 27-14 cushion with 13 seconds left in the third quarter. \nCarroll’s 9-yard run made it 27-21 with 13:29 left in the fourth quarter. \nThe Warriors return home for the first time in three weeks Saturday for a Halloween night game against Rhodes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:54:12.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
