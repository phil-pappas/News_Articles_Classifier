All are in the final year of their contracts, but all retain a hunger to sip from the silver chalice once again.\n\"Sure, I think you're always [more driven] when the years start dwindling,'' Campbell said recently. \"It's not like I got 15 years to win a Stanley Cup. It's something I was able to do, but I want to do it again, so the years tick down and it's definitely in desperation mode.\n\"If we can get in [the playoffs], a lot of things can happen with this hockey club and what we can do.''\nCampbell hasn't missed a game since Panthers General Manager Dale Tallon convinced him to be the pied piper of a nine-player overhaul on July 1, 2011 — a season after he won the Cup in Chicago — in an effort to change the culture of the franchise. Of that group, Campbell is the only one remaining.\nWhile the Panthers did shock the hockey world in 2012 and snap a record 10-season playoff drought with Campbell winning the Lady Byng Trophy, they haven't sniffed the postseason since.\nThat season, Campbell anchored the seventh-ranked power play with 31 of his 54 points coming with the extra man. However, the power play has been ranked 30th, 30th and 24th since, with Campbell notching 13,15 and 13 power-play points during that span.\nCampbell's offensive production slipped to just 27 points last season as his Rookie of the Year partner Aaron Ekblad usurped some of his power-play duties with 13 of his 39 points coming on the power play, including six PPGs (third most on team).\n\"His playmaking ability, his vision on the ice is unbelievable,'' Ekblad said Thursday. \"He's vocal and our quarterback of everything on the ice, who dictates the speed of the game, so he's a great player to be with.''\nThe power play improved in the second half of the season when coach Gerard Gallant went with four forwards and one defenseman, and then went up another notch when Jaromir Jagr came aboard for the last 21 games.\nGallant had heard some negative comments about Campbell before he became coach, but soon became a Campbell booster.\n\"People talked about him saying [the Panthers] were losing a lot and he wasn't a real good leader on the team. I saw nothing like that,'' Gallant said. \"We had a little chat and he was great with Ekblad and our kids. He was outstanding.\n\"His skating, his smarts and he's good with the puck. He's patient and sometimes when he has a tough game maybe he holds onto the puck too long, but most of the time he makes the right decisions.''\nAlways among the league leaders in time on ice and about to enter his 17th season on a 304 consecutive games played streak, Campbell admits he can play better.\n\"If I take a day off I get too stiff now,'' joked Campbell, who last season notched his first on-ice plus (4) rating since joining the Panthers. \"I still feel I can get better and improve and learn every day.''\n Ice Hockey Brian Campbell Florida Panthers Stanley Cup Playoffs Dale Tallon Jaromir Jagr Shawn Thornton", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616e3f8/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-main-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:23:08.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
