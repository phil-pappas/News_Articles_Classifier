The targeting was called for the hit on the defenseless quarterback for forcible contact to the head or neck area. It was helmet to helmet contact. When the play was reviewed by instant replay, the call on the field stood. A defenseless player cannot be hit by an opponent with forcible contact in the head or neck area with the hand, fist, forearm, elbow, shoulder or helmet. The other form of targeting is that a player cannot make forcible contact with an opponent with the crown of his helmet.” \nAsked about the play this week, UW coach Chris Petersen sounded frustrated but said “I can’t say anything” about officiating.\n“You’ve seen the tape. What’s your opinion on that? I can’t say anything. That’s the bottom line,” Petersen said. “You guys have seen it and it is what it is. I know what your opinion is. I know what everybody’s opinion is. It is what it is.”\nThe Huskies believe Victor might now be a “marked man” for officials. In Victor’s place Saturday against Oregon, senior Scott Lawyer will make his first career start, with true freshman Ben Burr-Kirven backing him up in the first half. Victor will be eligible to play in the second half.\nAdam Jude : 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @A_Jude .
