That’s how it feels, however, for the Cardinals . St. Louis beat the Pirates 11–1 in the second game of a doubleheader on Wednesday night to clinch the National League Central title and a 100-win season, but will head into October seemingly bleeding from a hundred different wounds. But in a season that has seen St. Louis lose player after player to injury, the Cardinals have somehow hung on, picking up a third straight division title that is as much a testament to the organization’s incredible depth as it is to the team’s talent.\nThough St. Louis blew its first chance at clinching the division on Wednesday, losing the first game of the doubleheader by an 8–2 score, the team took care of business early in the nightcap. The Cardinals put two runs on Pittsburgh’s Charlie Morton then blew the game open in the third on a grand slam by Jason Heyward , tacking on five more runs over the final six frames to take the 11–1 win. The victory, the Cardinals’ 100th of the season, makes them the first team to reach the century mark since the 2011 Phillies and the first St. Louis squad to hit 100 wins since the ’05 team that went 100–62. The franchise record of 106 (set in 1942) remains out of reach, but with three games against the hapless Braves left to go in the season, the Cardinals could finish with more wins than all but four teams in St. Louis history.\nMLB Video With Kershaw, Greinke and unlikely lineup, Dodgers win NL West by Jay Jaffe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:57:39.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
