Sean Payton is tired of answering questions every year about rumors he might leave the New Orleans Saints for another job.\nAdChoices Most recently, Payton has been linked to the Miami Dolphins since the franchise let go of Joe Philbin. He was linked to the Dallas Cowboys when he was suspended for a year, as well as the University of Texas and Michigan.\nHe couldn’t avoid the rumors any longer, however, when asked about them directly on Monday after practice. Via the team’s website, this is what Payton had to say :\n“A year ago there was a report from Peter King. . . . I think that happens when you’re in year ten, I think, and you’re not having success. There’s this, ‘Well, you know, is there another job he’d be interested in?’\n“…I love it here. I’m close to my children. I bought a — just built a brand new place here. So you get tired of answering the questions and yet I understand you asking. And I’ll say what I said before. This is where I see myself. And I’ve said that now, for however many years.”\nClearly he’s sick of all the questions.\nIt’s going to happen like this for big-name coaches who have been in one spot for a long time and then run into a rough patch, though. What is interesting on this note is that coaches like John Harbaugh and Mike Tomlin don’t get asked the same questions quite nearly as often as Payton does, which points to the stability within those organizations at the top.\nSpeculation aside, there’s no doubt the Saints are failing right now. The defense is the absolute worst in the NFL in yards allowed and the third-worst in points allowed. Combined with an aging Drew Brees and a depleted corps of receivers – this roster is just not what it used to be.\nBut it’s not like Payton has suddenly forgotten how to craft a brilliant offensive game plan, which is why he’s always one of the hot names first raised whenever any coaching vacancy occurs. If the Saints can reload on both sides of the ball the next few years, there isn’t any reason the coach can’t stick around for another decade in New Orleans.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/miami-dolphins-indianapolis-colts-new-orleans-saints-sean-payton-101115", "http://www.neworleanssaints.com/media-center/audio/Cameron_Jordans_Conference_Call_for_Oct_12_2015/b7908a31-ef74-4404-802f-79fc49709a4d", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:35:45.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
