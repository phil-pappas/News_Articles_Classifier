Coach Charlie Strong faced questions afterward about whether his players still believed in him. \nThe Longhorns (1-4, 0-2 Big 12) are off to their worst start since going 1-9 in 1956. \n___ \nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:41:18.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
