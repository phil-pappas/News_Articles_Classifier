(AP) - Wildlife officials are investigating after a bear attacked a man outside Eastpoint motel.\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation officials say Charles Griffin was walking near the Sportsman's Lodge Motel and Marina on Friday night when he encountered a bear. He was released after being treated for nonlife-threatening injuries. Wildlife officials are conducting trapping efforts.\nThe attack comes on the eve of the state's first bear hunt in more than 20 years.\nOfficials have sold more than 3,200 permits for Saturday's controversial hunt. The season ends after a week, or as soon as the cap of 320 kills is reached.\nProtests are planned around the state. Activists said the state should instead focus on trash management and curbing the smell of food in garbage.\nWildlife officials say the black bear population had grown to 3,500 - up from a few hundred in the 1970s - and presents a safety problem.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
