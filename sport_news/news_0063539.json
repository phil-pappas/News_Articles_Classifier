But that was the extent of Kesler’s strong dislike for the newest league maneuver to a part of the game that he excels at. Like anything else, there will be a period of adjustment for him and all centers that take the majority of the draws for their teams.\nThe NHL’s Board of Governors ratified an original proposal by the league’s general managers in March to adjust the faceoff rules. Players on the defensive side of the red line must put their stick down first, which veteran faceoff artists contend is a disadvantage in the circle when the linesman drops the puck.\nPreviously, players on the visiting team had to put their stick down first in all zones and the center-ice faceoff dot. Carolina GM Ron Francis, a Hall of Fame center who excelled in the circle, pushed for the change with the theory that it would create more offense.\nIf a center in the offensive end is able to get an added edge, it figures to lead to more puck possession and the increased chance of a goal. It is something that Ducks center Shawn Horcoff is on board with.\n“The league is trying to create offense,” Horcoff said Saturday. “They’re trying to give the team in the offensive zone the advantage, which it is. I think if you ask any centerman taking draws or the majority of them in this league, it is a big advantage to be able to go in second.\n“Whatever you can do to increase offense, I’m for.”\nKesler was a top-10 performer in the circle last season, winning 56.3 percent of the time. Not only does he take the majority of the faceoffs for the Ducks but he’s usually the one called on when it comes to key defensive-zone draws to protect a lead late in games.\nIn other words, this ace’s job just got a bit tougher.\n“It’s going to take a little bit to get used to,” Kesler said. “You kind of get into a routine when you have the home ice for four or five games. You get into a routine of going down second and getting that rhythm. It might take you a game on the road to get back to used to going down first.\n“It’s just going to be a learning curve for everyone. I don’t know if it’s going to create more offense or not. We’ll see.”\nNow in his 12th season and second with the Ducks, Kesler is confident that he’ll adapt quickly. He said he has a mental book on all the centers he faces across the league, noting that all have “tendencies” that are different in away games as opposed to when they’re at home.\n“It’s always trying to outsmart the other guys, right and then just battle,” he said. “Who wants it more? Obviously there’s technique involved. Winning a draw is only a percentage of it. It’s whatever is done afterward, whether you’re winning your draws.\n“Fifty-fifty pucks a lot of the times. Last minute, usually I’m just trying to tie up and try to have my wingers kick it back for me. You just don’t want to lose it really clean.”\nROAD OPENERS \nThe Ducks are used to going on the road to start their seasons. This was the 17th time in 22 seasons that they’ve done so and the fifth in a row, with the last season opener at home coming in 2009 against San Jose.\nIn this instance, the Ducks weren’t making a long-distance flight like to Pittsburgh last year or Detroit in 2011 or all the way to Helsinki in 2012 when they played Buffalo in Teemu Selanne ’s homecoming.\n“It’s going to happen sometime so it doesn’t really matter,” Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said. “We play 41 road games. We’re going to go across (the country). Everybody’s got some bad trips. We’ve got some rough trips as well. But you’ve got to do it.”\nNOTES \nThe Ducks scratched center Chris Wagner, winger Tim Jackman and defenseman Josh Manson … San Jose’s Marc-Edouard Vlasic became the franchise’s all-time leader in games played as a defenseman (672), moving past Mike Rathje.\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:37:19.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
