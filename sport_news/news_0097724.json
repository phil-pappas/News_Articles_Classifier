German soccer player Bastian Schweinsteiger isn’t getting a kick out of a Nazi doll that he believes shares his likeness.\nThe Manchester United midfielder is considering taking legal action against Hong Kong-based toy company Dragon in Dream, that created a figurine that bears an uncanny resemblance to the soccer star, BBC reported.\nThe toy, which costs about $120, dons a grey uniform with a swastika and Nazi eagle insignia on its coat and headgear.\n“This is a clear violation of Schweinsteiger’s personality rights,” lawyer Ulrich Amelung told the German newspaper Bild.\n“Everyone has rights to their own image. To see him as a swastika-bearing Wehrmacht soldier also constitutes a gross defamation and insult.”\nDragon In Dream \"WWII Army Supply Duty - Bastian.\" The toy company did not return a Daily News request for comment, but a company spokesperson did tell Bild, “We don’t sell any figures which resemble footballers. It is a complete coincidence that the figure ‘Bastian’ looks like Schweinsteiger.”\nThe doll’s name, “Bastian,” however, might be a dead giveaway.\n“We thought that all Germans look like that,” the spokesperson said.\n“Bastian is also a very common name in Germany.”\nbrobins@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.bild.de/bild-plus/news/inland/bastian-schweinsteiger/als-nazi-puppe-aus-china-43099810,var=a,view=conversionToLogin.bild.html", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34606799"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:20:01.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
