You hope you're 5 under or something like that instead.'' \nGosler won the first three holes with birdies and pushed it back to 3 up with another at No. 6. \n\"That just built so much confidence for me,'' said Gosler, who is competing in the tourney for the second time. \"I was hitting the ball well and felt confident on the greens.'' \nDownes was never able to mount a run, missing a few chances just before the turn. \n\"I had a couple chances late on the front nine, but it didn't happen for me,'' said Downes, the No. 5 seed whose 30-foot birdie putt was covered by Gosler at the par 3 seventh. \nGosler had beaten Adam D'Amario of Indian Hill CC and No. 1 seed and defending champion Adam Rainaud on Tuesday. \n\"I beat some of the top guys just to get this far,'' the 32-year-old left-hander and Glastonbury resident said. \"Adam is the best player in our section the last couple of years, and Tony Kelley, one of the legends. It means a lot to play so well against them.'' \nGosler, 32, said his success this week ranks highly among career achievements, which include a third–place finish at the Section's PGA Championship. \n\"I've had some top-10 finishes, I've put myself in contention enough times,'' said Gosler, the championship's 16th seed. \nShea, the No. 7 seed, took control by winning four of the last five holes. \n\"My putter has been so good, especially down the stretch of these matches,'' Shea said. \"This stretch has been the best I've played all season.'' \nThree times, Dell answered birdies by Shea with one of his own at the next hole. Dell won Nos. 11 and 12 to take a 1-up lead, before Shea birdied three of the next five. \n\"He made seven birdies, no wonder I lost,'' said Dell, a runner-up in 1995 and 2003. \"He birdied 16 and 17, you have to give him credit.'' \nDell's only lead disappeared when he bogeyed the par-3 15th hole, making his first bogey since the sixth hole of his opening round match. \n\"That bogey opened the door for him,'' Dell said. \nShea, 46, had advanced to the semis after eliminating No. 2 seed Kyle Bilodeau. \n\"I was 2 down on two occasions,'' Shea said. \"The turning point came at 15. He was in for par and I made a 10-footer to save par. That would have put me 2 down if I don't make it.'' \nShea made it all square with a two-footer for birdie at 17 and won it with a safe, two-putt par from 18 feet at 18. \nGosler rolled past Tony Kelley of Wyckoff CC in a 3-and-2 quarterfinal win. \nGosler was 5 up at the turn, before Kelley climbed as close a 3 down with birdies at the 13th and 14th holes. \nIn morning quarterfinal action, Downes and Dell each posted 5-and-4 victories over John Cook of Manchester CC and Eric Smith of Black Hall Club, respectively. \nDell, the 14th of 32 seeds, opened with two pars before winning six of the next eight holes. \n\"I just kept hitting it to six or eight feet,'' Dell said. \"I had 90-yard wedges all day. A lot of these holes here play about 370 (yards), so it's not as much of an advantage for guys who hit it longer than me. We both are hitting wedges into the green, whether it's 90 yards or 40 yards. \n\"It would be a big difference if it was a 4-iron instead of an 8-iron.'' \nDownes turned with a 3-up lead against Cook and made the last of his five birdies at the 13th and 14th holes to end it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:22:42.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
