The lack of cloudiness and light winds contributed to cooler temperatures than 24 hours earlier. \nTemperature readings around 4 a.m. were in the upper 20s and 30s in the mountain valleys and in the upper 40s and upper 50s in the Central Valley. \nDry weather was expected to continue through Tuesday afternoon until a weather system approaches. The high on Monday is predicted to be 80 degrees. \nRain could edge into the Sacramento region Tuesday night. The amount of rainfall Tuesday night and Wednesday is not easy to predict for weather computers trying to figure out the system, according to the NWS. \nThe detailed, 7-day forecast from the NWS for the Sacramento region: \nMonday: Sunny, with a high near 80. Calm wind. \nTonight: Mostly clear, with a low around 57. Calm wind. \nTuesday: Mostly cloudy, with a high near 74.
