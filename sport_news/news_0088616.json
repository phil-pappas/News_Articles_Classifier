Should it advance, MKA would visit No. 6 Newark Academy in the Round of 16. \nThe play-in bracket that will determine Montclair's Round of 16 opponent includes No. 14 Newark Tech, as well as No. 19 Glen Ridge and No. 26 North 13th Street Tech. \nMounties win on long road trip \nSaturday morning, Montclair extended its unbeaten streak to seven by heading down the Shore and leaving with a 3-1 victory over Ocean Township. \nThe Mounties did all their scoring in the first five minutes after halftime, with Quinn Baity breaking a scoreless tie with his team-leading sixth goal of the season in the 42nd minute, quickly followed by an own goal and a Gabe Friedin tally moments later. \nCougars top belleville \nSaturday afternoon, Dylan Ladda netted twice to propel MKA to a 2-0 victory over Belleville in a non-conference matchup. \nSeth Kaplan and Alex Cappitelli each assisted on a goal as the Cougars (3-6-1) scored multiple goals for the first time this season. \n-Kevin Meacham Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:33:30.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
