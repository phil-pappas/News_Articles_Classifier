I’d be racing off, too, if I saw a bottle coming,” said Cheika, who has been sanctioned in the past for criticizing match officials. “I don’t think anything of him going off quickly. \n“I don’t like the way that people are making something out of the way he ran off the field.” \nJoubert was harshly criticized in the British press for awarding the penalty for a Scottish offside infringement following a lineout in their own half in the 78th minute, when the ball was tapped loose and ricocheted forward from one man in a dark-blue jersey to another. In the process, the ball apparently came into contact with Australia replacement scrumhalf Nick Phipps, but Joubert didn’t see that from his angle, and made the call based on instinct. \nHe couldn’t ask for a review from the Television Match Official, because referrals can only be sought when awarding a try or assessing acts of foul play. \nIf he’d seen the ball hit Phipps’ hand, Joubert could have ruled it an accidental offside by Scotland and awarded Australia a scrum. \nGiven the Wallabies had scored five tries - and had one disallowed by the TMO after a referral by Joubert - and were within range to attempt a dropped goal, there’s no saying the Scots would have won, anyway. \nIt was two opportunistic tries, including Mark Bennett’s intercept in the 74th minute, and accurate goalkicking from captain Greig Laidlaw that gave the Scots the chance at an against-all-odds victory with five minutes remaining. \nIt’s also questionable if the English media would have been so outraged at a decision going against Scotland if the Scots weren’t the last European team left in contention. \nAustralia’s win ensured that, for the first time, all of the Rugby World Cup semifinalists came from one hemisphere - the south. Australia will play Argentina, and defending champion New Zealand will play South Africa. \nThe All Blacks trounced France by a record margin, Argentina beat Six Nations champion Ireland 43-20 and South Africa scored a late try to beat Wales. Those wins came before the Australians played Scotland, which was given almost no chance of ending the southern hemisphere streak but got the closest to it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:37:37.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
