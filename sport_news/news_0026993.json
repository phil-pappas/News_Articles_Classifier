It tied the mark set by David Healy of Northern Ireland in Euro 2008 qualifying. \nIreland finished three points behind Poland, but can still qualify for the Euros via a playoff. \nGermany was unconvincing for long periods against Georgia and had to wait until Mueller’s penalty in the 50th minute to make the breakthrough. Georgia captain Jaba Kankava equalized three minutes later, only for Kruse to claim the winner in the 79th. \nIn Warsaw, Grzegorz Krychowiak fired Poland ahead in the 13th, only for Jon Walters to equalize three minutes later with a penalty. \nLewandowski claimed the winner with a header to Krzysztof Maczynski’s cross in the 42nd. \nScotland routed Gibraltar 6-0 in Faro, Portugal, in the other group game to finish three points behind Ireland in fourth. Georgia finished six points further back, with Gibraltar bottom on none. \nGROUP F", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:23:12.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
