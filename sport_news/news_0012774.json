Perhaps he fears losing the support of the Arab street.\nA government security official with knowledge of the Arab sector, who did not want to be identified because of his working relationship with Arab leaders, told The Jerusalem Post that the Israeli Arab public deserves leadership that will truly represent their interests, not the interests of the Arabs in the West Bank or Gaza.\nIsraeli Arabs need leadership that will address their day-to-day needs.\n“All I hear and see are comments that serve the narrow political interests of their parties, not the Arab public,” said the official.\nDr. Mordechai Zaken, head of minority affairs in the Public Security Ministry and a former Arab affairs adviser to the Prime Minister’s Office, told the Post in an interview on Tuesday that from his experience, the majority of Israeli Arabs are not interested in this kind of conflict, as it does not serve their interests.\nThe young age of many of the Palestinian attackers represents an acute generation gap. Additionally, their generation did not experience the intifadas, he said.\nThey do not respect or listen to the older generation and are often acting on their own, with the facilitation of propaganda from the Internet, explained Zaken.\nThe incident on Sunday in which Nazareth mayor Ali Salam shouted at Odeh to leave his city and stop incitement reflects part of the Arab public that is scared to speak up, as the mayor did.\nHe noted that Salam is a bitter rival of Hadash and defeated their candidate to win the mayoralty.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:28:44.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
