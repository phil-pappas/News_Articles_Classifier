(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo)\nLooks like there were quite a few instances of failures to communicate in Thursday’s NLCS Game 5 between the Dodgers and Mets.\nThe first was when a live camera pointed down at the Dodgers dugout caught an animated discussion between a visibly upset Andre Ethier and manager Don Mattingly in the bottom of the third inning. TBS analysts Ron Darling and Cal Ripken guessed it had to do with Mattingly not being too happy with Ethier’s inability to move a runner into scoring position.\nMoments later, TBS reporter Sam Ryan was asked to do a taped interview with Mattingly, taking place between the bottom of the third and top of the fourth inning. It aired after a commercial break coming into the fourth inning.\nBut given time to ask two questions, Ryan didn’t at all address the Mattingly-Ethier situation . She asked first about how the Dodgers were doing against Mets starter Jacob de Grom — which Mattingly implied there was a lack of execution since it would “have been nice to have cashed in a few more” runs — and then Mattingly’s assessment of Zack Greinke’s performance.\nIf Ryan was close enough to the Dodgers’ dugout to prep for the Mattingly interview, did she not see the exchange take place? Did someone in the TBS production truck fail to tell her about it?\n• PHOTOS: Mets eliminate Dodgers in Game 5\nA TBS spokesman said only that there was “a miscommunication,” without singling anyone out.\nThe Twitter world, of course, was among the first responders.\nKeith Olbermann, a one-time Fox Sports MLB playoff dugout reporter, sent out a four-part tweet that began: “You cannot cannot cannot do an in-dugout interview with a manager who just got screamed at and not ask him about it #EvenIfHeWalksAway … I mean if the interviewee tells you he won’t talk about it, you say that, and you move on — you’re in the clear.”\nThere was some misinformation also put out that Ryan’s interview came before the Mattingly-Ethier incident , but that was not true.\nSam Ryan did not address the “miscommunication” on her Twitter account with any posts explaining.\nAfter the game, Mattingly told the media that he was simply trying to calm Ethier after he disputed a strikeout so that he would not get thrown out of the game by the umpire.\n“He’s maybe yelling at me because I’m trying to settle him down, but it was nothing between us,” Mattingly said in a post-game interview carried on SportsNet L.A.\nAdvertisement\nWhat just happened?\nThe one live shot that TBS could have used in Friday’s coverage was one in the top of the fourth inning that picked up the Mets’ Daniel Murphy catching the Dodgers asleep as he went from second to an unguarded third base after Greinke walked Lucas Duda.\nWith a live shot on Greinke for a reaction after the walk, the Dodgers pitcher flinched as he noticed the Murphy play happening before him. TBS, however, cut to a replay of the final pitch of the Duda at-bat before play-by-play man Ernie Johnson exclaimed: “And look at Murphy taking third!”\nYes, we’d like to, but we can’t.\nDarling immediately explained how the base wasn’t covered because of an exaggerated shift on Duda that put all but one infielder on the right side. It took a high-angle replay from third base — and the one from the Goodyear blimp — to finally actually show what really transpired.\nA sacrifice fly later, the Mets tied the score.\n“To all you analytic guys with the shifting, everything went ‘tilt’ right there,” Darling said, summarizing the play again and allowing for some distain for that strategy to come through.\nThe Dodger spin\nIt was, as Dodgers executive Ned Colletti described it, “a precious moment” when the SportsNet L.A. cameras captured a pre-game speech that Joc Pederson’s older brother, Champ, gave the team in the clubhouse before Game 5.\nBut there was little precious about the Dodgers’ analysis of what happened in the series finale during the post-game show.\n“They made mental mistakes, they didn’t execute and when you go 2 for 13 with runners in scoring position, it’s tough to win a ballgame,” said Nomar Garciaparra.\n“I think about the details you have to think about in a do-or-die kind of game,” said Orel Hershiser. “There’s no time to take a breath, no time to let your foot off the gas pedal. (Sigh) It bugs me. It really bugs me because this is what you prepare for. It’s sad to end the season like this.”\n“It’s sad but it’s not surprising,” added Garciaparra.\nWho was watching\nTuesday’s TBS broadcast of Game 4 of the Dodgers-Mets series did an 8.9 rating in L.A. and 13.5 in New York. That was to date the greatest Nielsen number for either city this postseason, but it will likely be topped by Thursday’s Game 5.\nWhat’s strange is to explain the disparity in the L.A. ratings for the four TBS broadcasts.\nAfter Game 1 did a hearty 8.1 rating on a Friday — which resulted in a Dodgers loss — the L.A. market came back only with a 6.3 rating to see the controversial Game 2 win on Saturday.\nMonday’s Columbus Day Game 3 was confusingly even worse — just a 4.9 rating. Then came Tuesday’s 8.9 for Game 4, an 82 percent jump, as Clayton Kershaw saved the series. The four-game average was 7.0.\nIn New York, the four games went 10.1, 10.5, 10.9 and 13.5 for a series average of 11.2.\nWith the help of the Chicago Cubs winning the other NLDS, TBS is up 44 percent over last year’s post-season ratings at this point in the proceedings. But a loyal St. Louis audience also helped that tremendously.\nNow, the Cardinals are gone and two of the three most populated TV markets are left in the National League.\nThose at the MLB said the entire 2015 postseason was up 16 percent over last year. TBS has averaged 5.5 million viewers a night before Friday’s game, the most since 2007.\nThe American League Division Series had the element of Canada’s Sportsnet involved in the coverage of the Toronto Blue Jays.\nThe insistence of MLB Network to take two playoff games continues to be a ratings embarrassment. The cable channel owned by the league had Game 2 of the Toronto-Texas ALDS on Oct. 9 and Game 3 of the Kansas City-Houston ALDS on Oct. 11. The games combined for a 1.9 rating, which is a marginal 6 percent increase over 2014, and the highest combined rating since post-season games have been on the MLB Network in 2012.\nStop it, now.\nAbout the Author Reach the author at thomas.hoffarth@dailynews.com or follow Tom on Twitter: @tomhoffarth Tom Hoffarth Back to top", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/15/mattingly-ethier-stage-screaming-match-in-dodgers-dugout/", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=33", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151015/SPORTS/151019596/AR/0/AR-151019596.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://twitter.com/tomhoffarth", "https://twitter.com/sportswatch/status/654831388055764992"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:41:44.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
