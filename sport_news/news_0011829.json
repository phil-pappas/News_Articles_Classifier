Twenty-seven trains were cancelled, 24 were short originated, terminated and diverted in the state, railway official said. The trains that stand cancelled included the Chandigarh-Amritsar intercity, Dehradun-Amritsar Express, New Delhi-Amritsar Express. Agitating farmers who yesterday extended their two-day protest till October 10 squatted on the railway track at different places, forcing railways to cancel or divert several trains. “We are continuing with our protest against the lackadaisical attitude of the Punjab government towards farmers’ issues,” BKU Ekta (Dakunda) General Secretary, Jagmohan Singh said today. Protesters have blocked rail traffic at Mansa, Rampura, Shergarh (Bathinda), Pathrala, Dagru (Moga), Lehragaga, Mucchal (Amritsar), Singh said. Because of farmers’ protest, train movement was hit on the Ludhiana-Ferozepur, Ludhiana-Amritsar, Fazilka-Ferozepur, Ferozepur-Bathinda, Ganganagar-Ferozepur sections, railway officials said. However, farmers’ outfits have decided not to block the train service from Abohar to Bikaner which carries cancer patients, Singh said, adding that some farmers have also blocked road traffic at Sangrur and Barnala. The police have released about 4,000 protesting farmers who were picked up during two-day protest, he added. Lashing out at the ruling SAD, which claims to be champion of farmers’ cause, BKU Ekta (Dakunda) General Secretary said that farmers had not received any call from the government to discuss the issue. “From day one, they (SAD) are not interested in talking to farmers. The state government had even arranged a meeting with its senior officers who we have already submitted our demands to, on which no action has been taken so far.” However, the Punjab government has claimed that it has released maximum compensation to cotton growers whose crop was damaged because of pest attack. The SAD had even accused farmers’ outfits of playing politics over the peasants’ issues. Among various demands, farmers in Punjab have been demanding Rs 40,000 per acre compensation for farmers whose crop got damaged by whitefly attack, Rs 20,000 per family compensation for farm labour, Rs 4,500 per quintal rate for basmati PUSA 1509 variety, and Rs 5,000 per quintal for basmati PUSA 1121 variety. Besides, they are also seeking payments of sugarcane dues by private mills, debt relief and Rs 5 lakh financial assistance to the family of farmers who commit suicide. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:50:55.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
