We’re challenging the entire community to show off their Pack Pride in two ways: Post videos and pictures to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram—and other social media outlets—using hashtag #backthepack to show off your Pack Pride; show us your killer tailgating traditions, Game Day rituals, kiddos decked out in Wolf Pack gear… the sky’s the limit! Snap a photo of a local business that is going above and beyond in showing their Pack Pride with a cool display or event; that business could get a visit from our #backthepack street team and be featured on the news! Thanks for standing with the Pack and being part of the movement. Get started by connecting with us on Facebook or search Instagram and Twitter using hashtag #backthepack", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:36:43.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
