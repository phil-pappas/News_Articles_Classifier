People are always disrespecting us each week thinking we're this or that,” Scott said. “I think that was great. I've watched it like five times already. I like the way that he went out there and told them how he felt. I don't feel like what people say about us is true. They're dwelling on the past. It's the future. We're going to take care of our business and do what we have to do. I'm glad he did it. \n“I do feel disrespected from it because it's still going on the past, and plus we're here on the team. It's disrespecting to us just because they're talking about our team and thinking we can't do this or can't do that. It's whatever. We take it as motivation. It's fun. We look at it and laugh at it, but it is disrespectful.” \nScott texted Swinney Sunday night to show his appreciation. \n“I texted him last night. It just gets me hype the way he's just with us and has our back through everything. It's great to know that from a coaching standpoint,” Scott said. “He just does what he does. Even with dancing part, you don't see coaches do that. They go in the locker room, and they're happy, but you don't see a coach go out there and dance with their team like that. It's just special. I don't think a team has it like us. People needed to hear that, and I think that him standing up for us was great just knowing that our coach has our back. It was great to watch him just go back at them.” \nScott said it makes him want to play even harder, but he doesn’t expect the disrespect to abate. In fact, he thinks Clemson will have to fight even harder against the perception. \n“Definitely, I was hyped about it every time I watched it,” he said. “But I think it's going to make them come at us even more. Like he said, it's like they want to see us lose. I don't know why. We didn't do anything. We just do things the right way, and I don't think people think like that. We're taking it one step at a time.” Rate this Story: Send Feedback to Nikki Hood: Email | Comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:03:44.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
