It's not that I'm not happy, I'm really happy, but these guys are younger. They fought and they worked their butts off and they care a lot. There is no butt-chewing that goes on at our practices, there is no yelling and screaming. There is a lot of good coaching going on. A lot of lessons those coaches are teaching. \n\"I wish you could have seen our locker room,\" Glenn continued. \"It was fabulous. One game doesn't make a season, but they got a taste of something that feels pretty darn good. I hope we can start repeating our efforts.\" \nWith three national championships to his credit over a head coaching career that began at Doane in 1975, it was going to be difficult for the coach to rank the win over the four-time defending national champions on his greatest hits list. but the fact that it came at his alma mater made it distinctive. \n\"This is my school,\" he said. \"I got a ring from 1974 when we were the co-champs with Joe Salem coaching but we didn't beat North Dakota State. When I got to Northern Colorado we didn't win and we didn't win — it must have gone up to 15 or 16 times I didn't win against the Bison. Maybe the law of averages caught up to them.\" \nHow the shocking win affects the Coyotes in the long run will be the next project, but the potential is there for it to be a season-changing victory at USD, which was on a 14-game Missouri Valley Conference slide when the Coyotes took the field in Fargo. \n\"There have been so many instances when we've been close,\" USD athletic director David Herbster told the Argus Leader ( http://argusne.ws/1RRCPBw ). \n\"We've seen a change in the culture and the mentality and the attitude of this team,\" he said. \"For a team that hasn't experienced that much success over the last three years, the strength and the resolve is as good as I've seen ever. That is a big testament to Joe Glenn and the staff and really the seniors — the captains and the leaders stepping up and helping to guide the team.\" \nRyan Saeger, who was 12-of-20 for 202 yards and two touchdowns while also running for 92 yards, was far from the only hero for USD, which had a 395-320 edge in total yardage, but his effort was an obvious place to start. \n\"Big-time,\" Glenn said. \"I wasn't really sure after the Western Illinois game — he missed a couple throws. He had a chance to run for a first down and came up short. I was thinking 'Oh-oh, I'm not seeing from him what I saw in spring ball and fall camp.' And then all of a sudden today he turned it up a notch. \n\"We put in a lot of quarterback runs — we put a lot of things on his shoulders and he came through with flying colors. He showed how you win at big-time level football. I think he's on his way now — this win should give him a lot of confidence.\" \nGlenn hinted that it had been a tough but constructive week for the junior, who was made vividly aware of some regrettable decisions he made in the loss to Western Illinois. \n\"We told him what we wanted from him,\" Glenn said. \"And he's back to being John Wayne again.\" \nThe Coyotes talked all week about the importance of being solid on offense, defense and special teams for the entirety against the Bison. To that end, punter/kicker Miles Bergner averaged 49 yards per punt while the punt team yielded just eight total yards in total punt returns. He also kicked the game-winning 33-yard field goal with no time left on the clock. \nOffensively, the Coyotes put together back-to-back scoring drives to tie the game at 14-14 and then added two more scoring drives in the fourth quarter, when visiting teams at the Fargodome had often unraveled over NDSU's 26-game home win streak. \nDefensively, the Coyotes held NDSU to 187 total yards over the last three quarters and shut out the No. 2 team in the country on their own field in the second half. \nIt was topped off by a bold send-almost-everyone blitz call on NDSU's last third-down attempt that forced a punt and set up the Coyotes' final drive for a field goal. \n\"Just great belief all around,\" Saeger said. \"Hopefully we can take this and use it as momentum going forward.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:07:41.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
