Four of the nine players listed on the depth chart in the secondary, cornerbacks Trumaine Washington of Miami and Duke Culver of Tallahassee; and safeties Chucky Williams of Hialeah and Jermaine Reve of Miami, also headed north. \n“We have a lot of guys from the state of Florida who grew up playing against their players,” Petrino said earlier this week on the ACC coaches teleconference. “Our guys have a lot of energy and a lot of focus this week.” \nFSU coach Jimbo Fisher knows more than a few of the Louisville players from recruiting them — especially Jackson. \n“He is a runner and he is dynamic but at the same time he has great arm strength,” Fisher said on the teleconference. “He’s a very, very good player.” \nThe Seminoles are off a 29-24 victory over Miami last week, always a good reason to be on an emotional high. But after losing their first three games by 7, 3 and 3 points, the Cardinals are on a bit of a roll, crushing non-conference foe Samford 45-3 and upsetting previously unbeaten N.C. State 20-13 before getting the week off. \nPetrino is 18-10 when having more than seven days to prepare for a game in his two turns with Louisville (2003-2006; and 2014-2015), and with Arkansas (2008-2011). \nThat includes four bowl victories and triumphs over teams such as Notre Dame last season (in South Bend), Texas A&M and Ole Miss when he coached the Razorbacks; and six games during his previous time with the Cardinals when his teams scored 34 or more points — and more than 60 points twice — when getting extra time to prepare. \nPetrino is 24-8 on the road in his six seasons with Louisville, and has won his last three road games against the Wolfpack, Boston College and Notre Dame. \n“Louisville has had some tough losses and could be sitting there 5-0 just as easy,” Fisher said. “Bobby is going to have a great scheme, giving an extra week to prepare.” \nThe Cardinals opened the season with a 31-24 loss to Auburn in a kickoff classic game in Atlanta. Then came a pair of losses by the margin of a field goal, 34-31 to Houston and 20-17 to Clemson. \nLouisville, a frequent opponent for FSU when both were independents, will be playing in Tallahassee for the first time since 2000. FSU is 8-1 against the Cardinals at home, losing only the first meeting in 1952 when a sophomore quarterback named John Unitas threw two touchdown passes in a 41-14 victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:13:39.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
