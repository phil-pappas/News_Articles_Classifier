These type of injuries do not clear up in a matter of days, meaning the Giants will be robbed of their best linebacker when they face the 49ers on Sunday night at MetLife Stadium.\n“I’m going to be doing everything I can,’’ Kennard said. “I’ve been icing non-stop and elevating it and trying everything I can to help the recovery process so I can be out there with my guys.’’\nAs a rookie, Kennard strained his hamstring and missed three games. He did not want to compare this injury to that one, but it is likely the Giants will have to play without him for more than one game.\n“The loss of Kennard is huge, he’s been playing really well,’’ said Mark Herzlich, who could be in line to move into the starting lineup.\nThe Giants have other options, as they have Jonathan Casillas and Uani ’Unga in reserve, as well as Herzlich.\n“You’re not going to be putting stuff on a guy who hasn’t done something on the field before,’’ Herzlich said. “We did that already this year but Uani ended up turning out to be awesome.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:39:32.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
