The mega star not only inaugurated the buses on Tuesday but also travelled in one of them, excitedly sharing the details of the ride on social media on Wednesday and attracting media frenzy.\nThe attractive buses are covered in lion and tiger prints, and will be taking tourists on the Big Cat safari. \"With Bachchan sharing the images of SGNP safari, we have surely got the much-needed boost for tourism. Now we are working on making every trip a memorable one. We plan to have audio aids as well as a guide soon, who will give information about SGNP and its bio-diversity, especially about the lions and tigers,\" said Shailesh Deore, Superintendent of Lion-Tiger Safari, adding that the plan will be implemented within a month.\nAccording to Deore, the guide will also ensure that nobody teases the animals or shouts at them to attract their attention.\nSources in the Forest said that over the years, the park safari where captive lions and tigers are released in a fenced open area, had become drab with old buses and drivers simply stopping the bus on spotting a cat. \"We were getting a lot of complaints from the tourists, so we decided to make a conscious effort to change the way the safari was being conducted,\" said an official. He added that since all the captive lions and tigers inside have names, the guide can also tell tourists about their interesting habits, while informing them about the SGNP's animal adoption scheme.\nChief Conservator of Forest and Field Director of SGNP, Vikas Gupta, said, \"We don't want people to just come here but to understand the importance of the forest and the animals. We are planning a complete package, including a short film, taxidermy models and the guided safari.\"\nBig B with Big Cat\n\"Here it is.. in the company of the Big Cat in the heart of the city.. you cannot imagine the forests that abound in the heart of urban Mumbai..This tiger chased us for 4 km.. very unusual.. they do not normally do this..It is in the SGNP Reserve, right within the Film City, where we work so often.. incredible\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:39:05.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
