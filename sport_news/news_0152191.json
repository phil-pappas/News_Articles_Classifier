Comment Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 10:04 PM By Observer-Dispatch Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 10:04 PM Colgate has the rare Friday night college football game on its schedule. The Raiders take on nonconference opponent Cornell at 7 p.m. today in Ithaca. It’s the first time a game will be played on a Friday night at Cornell’s Schoellkopf Field, which opened in 1915. The Raiders (1-3 overall) are coming off a 31-14 Patriot League win last Saturday at Holy Cross, which snapped a three-game losing streak to start the season. Cornell lost its first two games to Bucknell and Yale to open its season. Yale, which rallied for 26-7 deficit against Cornell, topped Colgate on Sept. 19 in Hamilton. Colgate, led by James Holland’s career-best 141 yards on 24 carries, totaled 266 yards rushing and had 411 yards of total offense in the win over Holy Cross. Jake Melville has thrown for 607 yards and three touchdowns on 60 of 107 passing this season. On defense, Chris Morgan was named the Patriot League’s Defensive Player of the Week after returning an interception for a touchdown to help clinch the win over Holy Cross. Morgan also added seven tackles. Pat Afriyie is third nationally in sacks with 5½. Cornell is led on offense by senior Luke Hagy, who has a streak of five consecutive 100-yard games after running for 117 yards and a touchdown against Yale. Quarterback Robert Somborn has thrown for 390 yards and four touchdowns in two games. Sophomore Nick Gesualdi, the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, leads the Big Red with 16 tackles.
