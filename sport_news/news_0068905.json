He rushed for 146 yards on 20 carries (7.3 avg.) and a touchdown. He caught three passes for another 50 yards. And he opened up the passing attack for Brandon Marshall (seven catches for 111 yards, 1 TD), who recorded his fourth-straight 100-yard receiving day to join Don Maynard (1968) and George Sauer (1966) as the only Jets to accomplish it.\nTurning point \nThe Jets were locked in a 13-13 tie early in the second half when Darrelle Revis baited Kirk Cousins then jumped the quarterback’s pass intended for Ryan Grant. On the next play, Ryan Fitzpatrick scrambled for an 18-yard touchdown. The Jets never looked back.\nEye-catching \nFitzpatrick threaded a sideline pass to Eric Decker, who made up for a costly fumble with a nice grab, then broke two tackles for a 35-yard gain to the Washington 1-yard line. It set up Ivory’s touchdown with 3:28 remaining in the first to tie the game, 7-7. … Ivory broke a 54-yard run in the second. It was the Jets’ longest run since his 71-yard scamper in the 2014 season opener. It set up Nick Folk’s 35-yard field goal to give the Jets a 10-7 lead. … In his season debut after a four-game suspension, Sheldon Richardson shared a sack with Mo Wilkerson. … Marshall made a one-handed catch on the run in the second. … In the third, Marshall turned a probable Fitzpatrick interception into a 35-yard touchdown. He came back on an underthrown pass to make a shoe-top grab, then broke a tackle en route to the end zone and a 27-13 Jets lead. … S Marcus Gilchrist intercepted a Cousins floater in the third. The ensuing drive ended with Fitzpatrick hitting Decker with a 2-yard TD pass for a 34-13 Jets lead.\nCostly mistakes \nDecker hauled in an 11-yard reception on the Jets’ first offensive play — then fumbled. Washington recovered at the Jets’ 37. Seven plays later, Pierre Garcon juked Revis and caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Cousins for a 7-0 lead. … Marshall had the ball ripped from his hands by Bashaud Breeland late in the second. Washington took over at its own 45. It resulted in Dustin Hopkins’ 54-yard field goal, tying the game, 10-10. … The Jets committed their third turnover of the first half when Fitzpatrick threw an interception to Breeland with 0:36 remaining. It resulted in Hopkins’ 30-yard field goal and a 13-10 Washington lead. … In the fourth, Jeron Johnson blocked a Ryan Quigley punt, and Rashad Ross recovered it in the end zone for a Washington touchdown.\nLooking ahead \nNow comes the showdown. The Jets (4-1) head to Foxboro to face their AFC East-rivals, the Patriots, Sunday at 1 p.m.\n— Jeff Roberts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:41.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
