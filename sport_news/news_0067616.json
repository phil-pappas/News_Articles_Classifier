The fumble was recovered by Taylor Cronan for the Tigers. \nMitchell found the end zone on a 9-yard touchdown run at 11:08. \nThe extra point was no good by Alan Sanchez because of a bad snap. \nThe Tigers held a 14-8 lead. \nEast Hall took the next possession and drove down to the Tiger 25-yardline where they attempted a field goal. \nThe kick was blocked by Colby Padgett. \nJeremy Whalen picked up the block and rambled down to the East Hall 35-yardline. \nWatson converted the score on a 3-yard quarterback sneak with just 2:09 left before halftime. \nThe two-point conversion by Mitchell was no good and Dawson County held a 20-8 lead. \nThe Vikings answered with their own quarterback sneak by sophomore Austin Parker with 52 seconds left. \nThe extra point was good and cut the Dawson County lead to 20-15 at halftime. \nParker was 25 for 42 passing for 275 yards and two touchdowns. He also threw an interception. \nDefensive back Dillon Nix ended the Vikings opening drive of the second half with an interception in the end zone at 9:25 in the third quarter. \nThe Tiger offense bogged down on the next drive. Dawson County attempted a fake punt by Maxwell with no success. \nOn Dawson County's next drive, Watson found Maxwell again on a 15-yard pass. \nThe point after was good by Sanchez and gave Dawson County a 27-15 advantage with 50 seconds left in the quarter. \nEvery offensive possession by the Tigers in the final two quarters was just hard-nosed running football. \nMaxwell and Watson rode their offensive linemen as they began to wear down the Vikings defensive front. \nDefensively, the Tigers bent, but never broke. \nIn the fourth quarter, Dawson County recovered a fumble by Padgett that ended another East Hall drive. \nEast Hall made it inside Dawson's red zone four times, but was only able to convert twice. \nMitchell sealed the game with a 23-yard score with just 3:52 remaining in the game. \nThe two-point conversion was good on Watson's run to give Dawson County a 35-22 lead. \nEast Hall had 12 penalties in the game. \nUp next is a home game against Franklin County. \nThe Lions come into the contest with a 2-0 region record. The Lions from Carnesville are also 3-2 overall. \nThe Lions defeated Lumpkin County 29-8 last week. \nThe winner of the game will hold the Region 7-AAA lead. \nKickoff will be at 7:30 p.m. at Tiger Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:35:20.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
