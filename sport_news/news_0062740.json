Here's the \"honor roll\" from Saturday's 49-7 loss to Ohio State . \nHEAD OF THE CLASS \n1. Running backs Paul James and Robert Martin \nPaul James was in vintage form on Rutgers' opening drive, carrying four times for 35 yards, including a 25-yard run when he trucked Ohio State cornerback Eli Apple. It was Rutgers' most promising pre-garbage time drive but it came up empty when Kyle Federico clanged a 29-yard field goal attempt off the left goal post. \nJames finished with a team-high 56 yards on 10 carries. In the four games since getting limited to seven yards on 10 carries against Penn State, James has averaged 8.5 yards per carry. With a run of at least 25 yards in each of the past four games, the senior appears to have regained the burst that was missing early in the season as he made his comeback from a torn ACL. \nMartin leads the team in rushing but continues to bat third in the running back order. The rotation limited him to just two carries in the first half and six in the game, but he still managed 43 yards. \nWith two effective rushers, Rutgers abandoned the run game prematurely. More on that below in the back of the class. \n2. Wide receiver Leonte Carroo \nGive Carroo credit for suiting up despite the fact that he likely wasn't 100 percent after suffering an ankle injury last week. The star receiver, who missed the first two practices of the week, didn't have a full workload but managed three catches for 55 yards in the first half. Carroo also beat a cornerback on a fade route in the red zone on the opening drive, but he couldn't catch up to Chris Laviano's pass. \nCarroo got rolled up on while making his last catch of the half and he was shutdown after halftime . The Scarlet Knights will need a healthy Carroo as they make a push for a bowl berth down the stretch. \nRELATED: 10 takeaways from Rutgers' loss to Ohio State \n3. Quarterback Hayden Rettig \nRettig finally got an opportunity in the fourth quarter with Rutgers trailing 49-0. He completed 3-of-7 passes for 42 yards and a touchdown in two drives. \nIn his first action since the season opener, Rettig showed some rust. Rutgers had to use two timeouts on the final drive because Rettig was slow to get the play called and get to the line. \nBut two throws showed why so many fans are clamoring for Rettig to get a shot. He ripped a 56-yard bomb to Carlton Agudosi that hit the receiver in stride. Two plays later, he fired a 4-yard touchdown pass into a tight window to Andre Patton in the back of the end zone. \nBACK OF THE CLASS \n1. Head coach Kyle Flood \nWhen a team loses by 42 points at home, the blame starts at the top. To his credit, Flood said as much during his postgame press conference. \nThere was an obvious talent gap that no game plan could have overcome. But that's why recruiting is such an integral part of being a successful college coach. It's not a coincidence that the bigger, stronger, faster team was the one full of four- and five-star recruits. \nAs for game management, there's not much to dissect from a 42-point loss. But Flood's decision to punt on fourth-and-2 from the Ohio State 40 in the second quarter was a head-scratcher. \nRutgers had converted a fourth-and-1 on its opening drive, which seemed to be a signal that Flood understood he needed to be aggressive to keep pace with Ohio State. But trailing 7-0, he went conservative and tried to play the field position game. \nJoey Roth placed his punt beautifully, but it bounced into the end zone before it was downed. Rutgers gained just 20 yards of field position, Ohio State took over at its 20 and scored four plays later to open the flood gates. \nAgain, one decision did not lose the game. It's more about the approach. Flood had to know it would be a challenge for his defense to consistently contain Ohio State's explosive attack, so he should have been willing to take risks to put points on the board. \nPLUS: Rutgers' season comes down to the next three games \n2. Offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels \nJames got the offense off to a promising start against a defense that entered the game ranked 60th nationally against the run. Before Ohio State proved it could stop the run, McDaniels inexplicably abandoned the ground game. \nMcDaniels' didn't call a run on Rutgers' second possession, which resulted in a punt after four plays. A false start and a fumbled snap got Rutgers backed up on its third possession and the only run was a Justin Goodwin draw on third-and-18. \nMcDaniels' play-calling was most puzzling on Rutgers' third possession. The Scarlet Knights had a first down after a 22-yard pass to tight end Nick Arcidiacono. James ran twice to set up third-and-2 from the Ohio State 40. McDaniels then out-smarted himself by going with an empty set and Laviano's out to Carroo was incomplete. \nThe situation was begging for a run on third down (and fourth down). Instead, Flood decided to punt on fourth down. Ohio State scored on the ensuing possession, Rutgers went three-and-out, Ohio scored again and the rout was on. \n3. Special teams coordinator Phil Galiano \nRutgers prides itself on strong special teams, but the kicking game has been a mess recently. The woes continued against Ohio State, with a missed field goal, a blocked punt and no production in the return game. \nA week after having two extra points blocked, Federico's missed chip shot on the opening drive was deflating. Kiy Hester was beat by an inside move off the edge that led to a blocked punt early in the fourth quarter. And Janarion Grant was completely neutralized in the return game. \nAfter two touchbacks early, Ohio State opted for shorter, high kickoffs that allowed the coverage team to hold Grant to an average of 12.8 yards on five returns. A pair of holding penalties on returns backed up the offense. Grant has been held in check since returning three kicks for touchdowns in the first two games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:21:47.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
