Murray High School is located. (Photo provided) × C.E. Murray High School is in Greeleyville, S.C., a bend in the road on Highway 521 in Williamsburg County between the Santee and Black rivers. That area has been one of the hardest hit by the recent heavy rains and flooding in South Carolina. “Many of our players have lost everything,” said Brian Smith, football coach at C.E. Murray, a Class A school with about 300 students and 35 players on the football team. “We’ve got six players staying at the school as a shelter, and we’ve got others we can’t get to because the water is too high. “As far as I know, they are all safe,” Smith said. “There are two players I have not been in contact with, but others have and said they are safe. So that’s a blessing.” Less of a blessing, Smith said, is the task of salvaging what’s left of the high school football season for his players. C.E. Murray is off to a 5-1 start this season, but already has missed two games and likely will miss another this week. The school was closed all of last week and Monday and Tuesday of this week. “We have a great team, probably the best team in school history,” said Smith, a 2001 graduate of The Citadel who played linebacker for the Bulldogs. “Our seniors have worked way too hard to give up the season and to give games. It’s not fair for them to be put in that position when there is still time to play games in November and December.” That would require the S.C. High School League to extend the regular season for a week, pushing back the playoffs, which in Class A are set to begin Nov. 6. The High School League has agreed to allow Class AA to push back its playoffs by a week, but so far, Smith and his Class A colleagues have gotten nowhere. “I’ve called publicly for an extension of the season,” Smith said. “But I don’t feel that is going to happen. The High School League has been nothing but adversarial and won’t give us a reason for not extending the season.” Without an extension, Smith said his region has decided it will play games on a Tuesday-Saturday-Tuesday-Saturday schedule. That’s four games in 12 days. The High School League has said it will support teams playing games with two days in between. “An extension would prevent us from having to face that scenario,” he said. “It’s one more week to work out the makeup games so that we’re not playing a game very three days. It’s absurd to do that.” Smith said many schools in the area -- Scott’s Branch, East Clarendon, Andrews, Hemingway, Georgetown -- are facing the same issue. In Georgetown County, three schools -- Carvers Bay, Waccamaw and Georgetown -- are playing games on Tuesday and Friday this week. Smith also pointed out that the High School League delayed the Class A state title game by a week last year while investigating allegations of an ineligible player. “It’s very disheartening,” he said, “that the High School League can’t alleviate our problems by giving us one week.” State swim meet A week later than planned, the High School League state swimming championships will take place on Saturday at the USC Natatorium in Columbia. The event was scheduled for last weekend but heavy flooding the downtown area of Columbia forced the meet to be postponed for one week. Academic Magnet’s boys’ team finished second in the meet last year after winning state AAA titles in 2012 and 2013. Christ Church is the defending state champion in AAA boys. In AAA girls, Hilton Head is seeking a sixth consecutive state title. Academic Magnet was state runner-up last season. In the AAAA boys’ meet, Riverside is seeking a third consecutive state title. The top local contender will be Wando. The Warriors won the state meet in 2011 and 2012. The AAAA girls’ meet has Riverside as the favorite going in. Riverside has won the last two state meets. Wando won the state championship in 2012. Wando claims WIT title Wando defeated Nation Ford in the championship match of the gold bracket to claim the Wando Invitational Tournament title over the weekend. Wando reached the finals with a semi-final win over Porter-Gaud while Nation Ford upended Bishop England in the other semi-final match. Ashley Hall reached the finals of the silver bracket with a win over Aiken but dropped the title match to T.L. Hanna. James Island defeated Eastside in the championship for the bronze bracket. Summerville and First Baptist were the other local teams in the 16-team field.

Verbal Commitments With the fall signing period rapidly approaching, several area baseball prospects are making verbal commitments. Recent commitments include Hanahan right-handed pitcher Parker Futrell to Charleston Southern and Summerville right-hander Wilson Beattie to South Carolina. Futrell’s father, Kevin, also played for Charleston Southern. His uncle, Jamie Futrell, also played and is a former head coach at Charleston Southern. Beattie becomes the sixth Summerville player to commit this fall. Others include Sawyer Bridges (USC), Phillip Tobin (Florence-Darlington), Rusty Grayson (USC Lancaster), Jack Bahen (Presbyterian) and Bo Gobin (Citadel). Correction In last week’s notebook, we made mention of a junior Shrine Bowl all-star game, to be held on Dec. 19 in Spartanburg. During the press conference announcing the rosters for the 79th annual Shrine Bowl all-star game, also to be played on Dec. 19, the Shrine Bowl spokesman announced the first-ever junior Shrine Bowl game. The game is a youth all-star game for younger aged kids, not for the high school graduating class of 2017.
