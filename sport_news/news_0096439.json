SAC Invitational for the Great Oak cross country teams. The Wolfpack traditionally goes for it at Mt. SAC, and this year is no different.\nSaturday’s girls team sweepstakes race is scheduled to feature the first head-to-head matchup between Great Oak senior Destiny Collins and Davis’ Fiona O’ Keefe since Collins wowed the capacity crowd at the CIF-State Track Championships by surpassing O’Keefe to win the 3,200 in 9:53.79, the fourth fastest time in California.\nThe two have developed a competitive rivalry, and that’s just the first storyline involving this weekend. Great Oak’s girls, dropped to No. 2 nationally by dyestat.com and flotrack.com behind defending national champ Fayetteville-Manlius (N.Y.), lead a competitive sweeps field that includes national No. 12 Saugus, No. 13 Arcadia, and No. 18 Davis.\nThe boys sweeps also promises to be an entertaining race, with a showdown between the Wolfpack boys, ranked No. 4 in the nation, and Dana Hills, which is No. 5. The two are also tied atop the Southern Section Division 1 poll.\nGreat Oak coach Doug Soles said he will run a top lineup on the both sides this week – the boys will be missing Nelson Quintana , who will be on a recruiting trip – and dominated last week at the Inland Empire Challenge to a victory in the boys sweeps.\n“The boys look fantastic right now,” Soles said. “Clearly, we were happy. We didn’t run five of the top seven guys, and still had a lot of guys step up.”\nKing, ranked 27th nationally on the boys side, is the other Inland-area team competing in the team sweeps, and will look to climb back up the rankings. The Wolves have been as high as 14th.\nRIVERSIDE ON FRIDAY The Riverside Invitational, run at the former Riverside Golf Club that will be used for CIF-SS Prelims this year, moved from the originally scheduled Saturday to Friday this week.\nThe move was to accommodate the Pac-West Conference Championships, which will be hosted by Cal Baptist on Saturday.\nLa Sierra coach Will Jacobsmeyer , also the event organizer, said 38 schools will be competing, headlined locally by his La Sierra team and Rubidoux. Also, a number of schools will be sending their “B” teams that have a starting seven competing at Mt. SAC.\n“We’re trying to build this thing slowly,” Jacobsmeyer said, “because when we get to CIF, we’ll have 50 schools at a time.”\nThe CIF-SS Prelims meet, runs for the first time on the Riverside course Nov. 14.\nContact the writer: lnegri@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:14:11.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
