(AP) — Driphus Jackson led the game-winning 83-yard drive, and the Rice defense stopped Florida Atlantic in the final minute to clinch a 27-26 comeback win on Saturday. \nRice (3-3, 2-1 Conference USA) fell behind 26-14 when FAU scored with 13:50 left in the fourth quarter. The game was stopped for 1½ hours due to lightning and FAU (1-4, 1-1) failed its 2-point conversion when play resumed. \nJackson pulled Rice within 26-21 on a 21-yard keeper with 7:21 left in the game and completed a 14-yard pass to Darik Dillard for the go-ahead score with 2:07 left. Rice failed on its 2-point conversion attempt. \nFlorida Atlantic drove to the Rice 41 on the ensuing drive but failed to advance from there. Alex Lyons and Preston Gordon teamed up to sack Jaquez Johnson on fourth-and-5, sealing the victory. \nJackson finished 22 of 34 for 284 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions.
