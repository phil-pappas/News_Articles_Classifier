Let’s just say his prayers went unanswered. In a last ditch effort to get back into the Pigskin Picks race (or at least make it competitive), Hanneman tried to predict every toss-up, upset, or pick-em he could think of. All told, he found eight games he thought might have that either/or quality he needed to make a big jump in the standings and cut into Jamie Baker’s huge lead. Turns out, those eight games weren’t as either/or as he thought. Baker picked the winning team in six of those eighth games. He posted a 16-2 record for the second straight week, improved his overall record to 121-27 and gained another four games on Hanneman, the grumbly, grizzled veteran of the staff. With victory — and the coveted Norm Nutman Award — all but is his grasp, Baker can virtually coast to his third Pigskin Picks title in four years. Hanneman could make another all bid this week, but he’s pretty much packed it in. We suspect he’s not as broken up about losing the title as he is worried about breaking the record for the worst record in Pigskin Picks history. With 41 losses already, he would have to pick the wrong team in 14 of the remaining 37 games on the regular season schedule. That’s highly unlikely, but considering his track record this season, we realize it’s still a possibility. Hanneman did tell us he got some good solid, feedback and support at a family get together over the weekend. Actually, we understand their exact words were: “Quit making so many dumb picks. You’re making us look bad!” Heeding that advice Hanneman has gone pretty much by the book this week. No upset specials. No pick ’ems or toss-ups. As a result, he and Baker have disagreed on just one game this week, with Baker picking Carey in a Northern 10 matchup with Seneca East and Hanneman going with the Tigers. Hanneman’s Picks TOLEDO WHITMER over Findlay — If not for a controversial call and a missed 2-point conversion, Whitmer, not Toledo Central Catholic, would be the unbeaten front-runner in the TRAC. McCOMB over Arlington — As McComb’s head coach, Kris Alge is 14-3 against his alma mater. With the team he has this year, I don’t see that winning percentage going down. Cory-Rawson over RIVERDALE — Only two teams (Marion Local and Van Buren) have been able to come out of their matchup with McComb and win the next week. If the Hornets aren’t too banged up, they can become No. 3. Hopewell-Loudon over NORTH BALTIMORE — Not sure if Austin Tooker will be back for this one. That could make a big difference. Leipsic over VANLUE — Vanlue may go 0-10, but I have a ton of respect for the toughest little school in the state willing to put it on the line every Friday night. VAN BUREN over Liberty-Benton — Van Buren has lost 13 straight to the Eagles. But the way the Knights are playing right now, 13 might be their ‘lucky’ number. Pandora-Gilboa over ARCADIA — Rockets have been putting up some pretty good offensive numbers lately; Redskins have been held to six points or less in five of their eight games. SENECA EAST over Carey — Tigers are 3-0 at home this season, and all three have been pretty impressive wins. Colonel Crawford at UPPER SANDUSKY — Not sure if the Rams’ defense can ground an Eagles’ offensive that is averaging almost 40 ppg. MOHAWK over Crestline — Warriors get a tune-up heading into a Week 10 showdown with Buckeye Central that will be loaded with playoff possibilities. Eastwood at ELMWOOD — The common opponents equation says take the Eagles in Wood County’s “Battle of the Woods.” FOSTORIA over Otsego — A strong finish to 2015 would be a big boost to the Redmen for 2016. Lakota at FREMONT ST. JOSEPH — Crimson Streaks are streaking, but with 10 straight losses they’re going in the wrong direction. Columbus Grove over PAULDING — Beating Paulding last year started the Bulldogs on their stunning 2014 playoff run. Will history repeat itself? BLUFFTON over Convoy Crestview — Toss-up. Tough call. There’s been a lot of those in the NWC this season. DELPHOS JEFFERSON over Ada — Jefferson might be one of the best Division VI teams in the state, but the Wildcats better not get caught looking ahead to next week’s winner-take-all showdown with Spencerville. PATRICK HENRY over Bryan — Against common opponents, Patriots have a better record and much better offensive average. Lima Perry over HARDIN NORTHERN — Commodores beat Ridgemont; HN didn’t. Ottawa-Glandorf over ELIDA — O-G needs at least one win against either Elida (5-3) or St. Marys (6-2) to have any shot at the playoffs. Elida (5-3) won’t be easy, but St. Marys, for some reason, has historically had the Titans’ number. Baker’s Picks TOLEDO WHITMER over Findlay — Another tough road game in a tough second-half schedule for the Trojans. McCOMB over Arlington — Coach Alge won’t allow the Panthers to look past the Red Devils this week. Cory-Rawson over RIVERDALE — Toss-up game. Hornets have won three of their last four. Hopewell-Loudon over NORTH BALTIMORE — Have a feeling Hopewell-Loudon will rebound this week, but it won’t be easy against the Tigers. Leipsic over VANLUE — Leipsic needs to keep winning to play in Week 11. VAN BUREN over Liberty-Benton — Big game with playoff implications; loser here’s hopes of a Week 11 game will likely be dashed. Pandora-Gilboa over ARCADIA — Rockets are still in the hunt in Region 24. They will determine their fate next week against Van Buren. Carey over SENECA EAST — Carey seems to be putting things together as the season winds down. Colonel Crawford at UPPER SANDUSKY — After Wynford, Colonel Crawford seems to be the best of the rest in the Northern 10 this season. MOHAWK over Crestline — Warriors will remind Crestline why they left the Northern 10. Eastwood over ELMWOOD — Eastwood has dominated the Battle of the Woods recently. FOSTORIA over Otsego — As long as they don’t get off to yet another slow start, the Redmen should roll. Lakota over FREMONT ST. JOSEPH — Lakota rolls in this Saturday night special at Don Paul Field. Columbus Grove over PAULDING — Grove has lost four straight. This is the week they get off the schneid. BLUFFTON over Convoy Crestview — Last week’s big win over Ada should propel the Pirates to good things this week against Crestview. DELPHOS JEFFERSON over Ada — Wildcats better not look past Ada with a Week 10 showdown with Spencerville looming. PATRICK HENRY over Bryan — Could be a tough one for the Patriots. The Golden Bears certainly aren’t as bad as their 0-8 record would indicate. Lima Perry over HARDIN NORTHERN — Commodores have won one less game, but have seemingly played better in the NWCC than the Polar Bears this season. Ottawa-Glandorf over ELIDA — Bounce back game for the Titans.
