That's a good number. It's the Rangers fifth best of the season. But it's hardly outstanding.\nIt certainly was better than the 3.8 the Rangers-Tigers posted Monday night when Detroit's Justin Verlander ruled. And it's better than the 3.0 season average. But this is a race for post-season position isn't it?\nFSSW beancounters say their's was the No. 1 network in D-FW from 9:15 to 10:30 p.m. when the game ended. The rating was up to 6.1. But this is a race for post-season position isn't it?\nI'm just going to point out here that the TCU-Texas Tech game scored a 7.0 on Saturday afternoon against lots of college football competition. I'm not even going to bring up the Cowboys-Falcons 28.1 rating early Sunday afternoon because baseball fans will scream that I'm comparing apples to oranges.\nSo let's play a game. Let's see if the total ratings for the Rangers final seven games -- the three against the Tigers and the four against the Angels -- can outdo the Cowboys season-to-date three-game overage of 33.1.\nRangers are at 8.9 with five to go. (Note: All bets are off if the Rangers clinch AL West before Saturday.)\nOn Twitter:\n @bhorn55", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bhorn55"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:20:46.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
