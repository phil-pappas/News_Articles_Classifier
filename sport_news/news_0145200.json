(Photo: Keith Haupt, Bloomsburg Press Enterprise)\n5 CONNECT 23 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE BLOOMSBURG, Pa. — Three months to the day since she put three balls in the Japanese net in 16 minutes and turned the World Cup final into her own personal highlight reel, Carli Lloyd was on the move again Monday, riding in the back seat of a Lincoln Navigator, another installment in her freshly frenzied life.\nDeparting her Mount Laurel, N.J., townhome at 9:15 a.m., Lloyd covered more than 300 miles in the rolling hills of north central Pennsylvania, munching almonds and talking about how hard it has been to keep up with everything.\n\"I'm not really a coffee drinker, but coffee has been my best friend these past few months,\" Lloyd said, smiling. \"I've barely had time to brush my teeth.\"\nAfter speaking to some 500 kids in the Millville High School auditorium in an afternoon assembly, Lloyd packed close to 2,000 people in the theater of Bloomsburg University, then got a police escort to Interstate 80, heading west to Lewisburg, where she drew 600 more people, mostly girls in soccer uniforms, to yet another auditorium, thanks to the North Union United Soccer Club.\nShe was greeted by chants of \"Car-li, Car-li\" and rousing cheers and hearty thanks from local organizers, who appreciated that she had made time for a small-town visit that was front-page news on the local paper.\nIt is all part of Lloyd's post-World Cup world. It is what happens when you score the first hat trick in the annals of the Cup finals, and lead your country to its first Cup title in 16 years, an event watched by more than 30 million TV viewers at its peak.\nIt is also what happens when you've scored the gold-medal-winning goals in the last two Olympics, and then outdo yourself on the biggest soccer stage of all.\nCarli Lloyd isn't just on a roll. She has morphed into a one-woman tsunami. In back-to-back victory tour games with the U.S. women's national team last month, she scored two more hat tricks against Haiti. Off the field, she recently signed an endorsement deal with VISA, a book contractand has several other major opportunities under discussion, according to Lloyd's agent, Josh Weil, who said inquiries about sponsorships, appearances and speaking engagements have come in by the hundreds.\nWeil declined to put a dollar value on Lloyd's three-goal barrage against Japan. \"There's been a tremendous increase in interest overall,\" he said.\nIt is pretty heady stuff for an attacking midfielder who has long been overshadowed by such teammates as Abby Wambach, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Sydney Leroux. And the perks show little sign of abating.

See Lloyd and other top female players and their national teams, in EA's FIFA '16.\nOn Thursday, Lloyd and team visit President Obama and family in the White House.\n\"It's been an incredible journey,\" Lloyd said, and she talked about it at all three stops on Monday, emphasizing the power of dreaming and believing, and most of all, of hard work. She calls the practice field \"my office,\" and made it clear that what goes on there is what drives everything.\n\"The (World Cup) final wasn't won on July 5, 2015,\" Lloyd said. \"It was won when nobody was watching.\"\nJust over 10 years removed from getting cut by the U.S. U-21 team and deciding – briefly – that it was time to abandon her dream of making the full national team, Lloyd completely embraces, and is driven, by the underdog mentality. She told her listeners that they are almost certain to encounter coaches who may not like their game, or teammates who might seem much more highly regarded. She talked about her own doubts and insecurities about not being good enough, and about the precious gift of honesty she got from the U-21 coach who sent her home, telling her she wasn't fit enough and didn't play hard enough.\nShe left the meeting in tears, she said. And then she went right back to the office.\n\"There's no room for giving up, no matter what happens,\" Lloyd said.\nLloyd met with small groups of youngsters before each engagement, talking soccer and signing posters and shirts. Allison Diehl, 13, a 5-9 sweeper from Millville, looked almost spellbound after her audience with Lloyd.\n\"It's almost surreal having her here,\" Diehl said. \"It's just crazy.\"\nEarlier in the Millville presentation, Lloyd took questions at the end of her talk. One of them came from Jack Darrah, a 17-year-old senior, who wore a small hoop earring and a purple tee-shirt.\n\"Would you come to Homecoming with me?\" he asked.\nLloyd laughed and so did everyone else.\n\"What day is it?\" she said.\nAs he departed the auditorium, Darrah explained himself.\n\"I just figured I'd give her the Millville welcome,\" he said.\nLater, Lloyd took a stand on gender equity regarding FIFA, the sport's troubled and corruption-ridden governing body, pointing out that Germany, winner of the men's World Cup, took home $30 million, and the U.S. women took home $2 million. Lloyd understands that worldwide sponsorship and TV revenue makes the men's tournament far more lucrative, but still ...\n\"I'm not saying we're as good as the men . . . (but) that's still too big a gap,\" she said. She spoke optimistically of the future of women's soccer worldwide, especially if more money can be funneled to emergent nations, and also said she was heartened that the NWSL got a major attendance boost after the World Cup.\nBefore the close of her final talk Monday night, someone asked Lloyd about her future. She talked about her marriage next year to her fiancé, a golf pro named Brian Hollins, and said wanted to play five more years, win two more Olympic golds and one more World Cup.\n\"Then I'll be 38. It might be time to try something else,\" she said.\nSoon it was time to leave, and Lloyd was back in the Navigator, heading back to south Jersey. She arrived a few minutes before 11 p.m. The plan was to get some sleep, train in the morning, work on the book in the afternoon and head into Philadelphia for a speaking engagement at a women's conference Tuesday night. Carli Lloyd knows it won't always be like this. She was not complaining, at all.\n\"It's been an amazing time,\" she said.\n5 CONNECT 23 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797360077808805-Lloyd-at-Millville-High-School-2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6fae13b6a0617b37eb24661d54b902be72d3de59/c=0-104-1664-1355&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797360077808805-Lloyd-at-Millville-High-School-2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebc9519ac086054fa5092ba711393606fbfe81d3/r=300/https/i1.wp.com/usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/gty_480320150_74414380.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5bb52ef5217c3befa70617bbdd05a784ca3e5993/r=500x383/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797360077808805-Lloyd-at-Millville-High-School-2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lg8HPk&text=Months%20after%20World%20Cup%20heroics%2C%20Carli%20Lloyd%27s%20whirlwind%20tour%20continues&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lg8HPk&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-06T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:02:11.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
