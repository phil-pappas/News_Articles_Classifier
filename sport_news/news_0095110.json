But in one of the strange side effects of the one-and-done era, this generation of Blue Devil greats, who are roughly the same age, never played alongside one another in a Duke uniform. \n\"That's just the era we live in,\" Duke freshman Chase Jeter said during Tuesday's preseason media day. \"They were all great players and they all had plans for bigger things. Whatever happened here, the next level was calling their names.\" \nA good illustration of this phenomenon can be found with two of this year's freshmen, Jeter and Luke Kennard. \nParker was Jeter's host when he made a campus visit for the North Carolina game as a high school junior. \nThe next year, Parker - midway through his first season with the Milwaukee Bucks - watched the showdown with the Tar Heels from behind the Duke bench. Sitting next to him was Kennard, who said he remembered Parker telling him that he was following his senior season of high school hoops from afar. \nParker is now entering his second year in the NBA. \nBoth Jeter and Kennard played alongside Tyus Jones and Winslow on the USA Basketball 18-under team that won the FIBA Americas title in the summer of 2014. Jeter said the friendship he struck with the two older players - and the glowing reviews they gave about their time as Blue Devils - was a major factor in his decision to play at Duke. Kennard remembers texting back-and-forth with them as they led the Blue Devils to last season's NCAA title. \nJones and Winslow are now NBA rookies. Like Kennard and Jeter, they never got a chance to play alongside Parker, either. \nBut Kennard and Jeter say there's still a connection. \n\"We all still know they love Duke,\" Jeter said. \"They always come back.\" \nIt's on those return visits in the offseason when the bond all of them share comes into focus. This summer nearly every recent former Duke standout stopped by. \nDuring those visits, pick-up games are played and stories and jokes are shared. They may have passed each other by on their journeys in and out of Durham, but the fact that they were there at all is enough. \n\"Duke is a brotherhood, it's more than just your time here,\" said Duke senior Amile Jefferson. \"After you leave, you're still a part of that brotherhood.\" \nStaff writer Stephen Schramm can be reached at schramms@fayobserver.com or at 486-3536.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:53:51.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
