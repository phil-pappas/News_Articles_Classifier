For some, seeing the familiar faces of Toronto's Josh Donaldson and New York's Yoenis Cespedes may be difficult as they bask in the postseason glow.\nFor Cespedes, that postseason run is guaranteed to last until at least October 31 as the New York Mets advanced to the World Series by sweeping the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field . Another former Oakland player, pitcher Bartolo Colon, earned the win in Game 4 with the Mets' 8-4 win over the Cubs. Early in the game, Cespedes left with what his team called \"shoulder soreness.\"\nFollowing the win, Cubs manager Terry Collins spoke about the outfielder's injury during the postgame press conference. \"Cespedes' shoulder is going to be okay,\" Collins said. \"They didn't think there was any damage. They thought an injection would calm it down in a day, so he'll be ready. We're going to work out on Friday and I'm sure he'll be ready for that.\"\nPhotos sprung up on the Internet of Cespedes playing a round of golf before Game 4. The 30-year-old stated that playing golf has been a part of his regular routine all season and that it did not aggravate his shoulder. Through an interpreter, Cespedes told reporters after the game, \"“I’ll be fine by Sunday. If not, I’ll chop it off and put a new one on.”\nGame 1 of the World Series is on October 27, giving Cespedes time to rest his shoulder. Despite the soreness, the former Oakland Athletics' star didn't skip a beat celebrating in the champagne-soaked clubhouse.\n\"This has been the greatest moment of my career,\" Cespedes said. \"I really don't have words to explain what I'm feeling right now.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/sports/baseball/new-york-mets-beat-chicago-cubs-nlcs.html?_r=0", "http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cespeyo01.shtml"], "published": "2015-10-22T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:07:41.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
