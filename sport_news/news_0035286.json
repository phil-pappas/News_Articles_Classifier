As front woman of the legendary band X, Cervenka's songwriting, singing and harmonies with fellow band mate John Doe made the group one of the most groundbreaking and influential American punk bands in history. Cervenka will read her poetry and discuss her experiences with X at an event at 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 22, at Room Z102, Building Z, on Harper's main campus, 1200 W. Algonquin Road in Palatine.
