Along with the off day Thursday, the Lady Wildcats rolled past the Shafter Generals 25-8, 25-9 and 25-19 in Shafter Tuesday evening. “We were short personnel last night due to several different reasons,” said Taft coach Adeana McDaniel Furman. “With that said I was very happy to see the girls playing in last night’s game come together as a team and continue to compete at a high level.” With the victory, Taft improves to 17-5-2 overall and 2-1 in the South Sequoia League. Taft set the tone in the early stages of the first set when they reeled off six straight points with half coming from Emily Salazar’s three aces. After the Lady Generals got their first point of the match, the Lady Wildcats outscored Shafter 4-2 to up the advantage 10-3. The Lady Generals briefly turned the tables, scoring two out of the next three points. However, Taft caught fire again with nine straight points highlighted by a pair of aces from Brooke Reilly and Cyerra Davis’ tip. Following Shafter’s next point, Taft went on a 5-2 run thanks in part to Davis’ ace to win the first set. Taft nearly duplicated their first set run at the start of the second set when they went on a 3-0 run. After the Lady Generals got their first point, Taft took off again with four unanswered points thanks in part to Brinley Rosenberger’s ace. Following another Shafter point, Taft took off again with a 7-2 run highlighted by three unanswered points, Hunter Everson’s ace, Reilly’s tip and Allison Mizener’s ace to lead 14-4. The teams would momentarily trade points before Taft caught fire with a 9-1 run thanks in part to Rosenberger’s ace. After Shafter put together a mini 2-0 run, Taft got the final point to win the second set. Unlike the opening two sets, the third set turned out to be tight starting with Shafter taking their first lead of the match at 1-0. After the teams tied at two, it looked as if the Lady Wildcats would pull away with a 4-0 run thanks in part to Angela Faa’gau’s ace. The lead would not last after Shafter stormed back with a 5-0 run to overtake the lead again at 7-6. The seesaw battle tilted the Lady Wildcats way with four unanswered points highlighted by Davis’ ace to lead 10-7. Shafter narrowed the deficit to one but Taft reeled off four straight points including Salazar’s back-to-back aces. Page 2 of 2 - The Lady Generals countered by cutting the lead down to three at 15-12. After Taft increased their lead to five, the Lady Generals whittled the lead to two at 18-16. Taft countered with a 7-3 run highlighted by Davis’ ace to close out the set and match. “During last night’s match we continued to try several different lineups,” said Furman. “We tried players in positions they had never played before and were surprised with the outcome. Each lineup of girls was very exciting to watch.” Davis led in kills with 9 while Warner had 5 and Faagau had 4. Davis, Warner, Reilly and Salazar each had a block while Neher led in digs with 7 and Davis had 5. Salazar led in assists with 15 while Mizener had 9. Taft had a bye Thursday. They will return next Tuesday when they travel up to Wasco.
