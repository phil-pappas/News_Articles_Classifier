Comment By Tim Whelan Jr./Daily News Staff MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA By Tim Whelan Jr./Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 8:00 PM By Tim Whelan Jr./Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 8:00 PM Last Saturday, the University of Massachusetts football team played at Notre Dame. There were 80,795 people in attendance, and hundreds of thousands more watching at home on NBC. For those back in Massachusetts who knew who to look for, there was 2010 Natick High grad Joe Kreinsen with a headset on in the coaches’ booth. “I got a few texts from friends, nothing more than that,” Kreinsen said with a laugh. “The other GA (graduate assistant) was right behind (UMass) Coach (Mark) Whipple. He’s got, like, 20 pictures of himself on TV.” While getting a cameo on national TV is nice, Kreinsen is not in coaching for the camera time. In his second year as a football GA at UMass, Kreinsen works as an assistant offensive line coach while helping in other facets of the offense. A four-year starter at offensive guard at Westfield State before graduating in 2014, Kreinsen had his eye on one profession. And thus far, workplace satisfaction is not exactly an issue. “I really genuinely love it,” Kreinsen said. “It’s everything I expected it would be.” He was there last year when UMass visited Penn State, a game that drew 99,155. He enjoyed the scene at Notre Dame, but it was a game UMass lost 62-27. “Being in that atmosphere, it was an unbelievable experience, but at the end of the day you just want to win,” Kreinsen said. UMass did just that on Saturday at McGuirk Alumni Stadium, upending Florida International, 24-14, its first win over a non-MAC (Mid-America Conference) team since its jump to the Football Bowl Subdivision in 2012. The Minutemen, who were 3-9 last year, are 1-3 and are making strides after going 1-11 in both 2012 and 2013. “I think everyone, from the coaches to the players, I think we’re all hungry for success. It’s coming, sooner or later,” Kreinsen said. For the former Natick wrestler (“I miss wrestling — I don’t know about the workouts, though,” Kreinsen joked) and football player who used to help protect quarterback Scott McCummings in Natick’s 2009 run to the Super Bowl, it’s not a bad first job out of college. Upon graduation from Westfield State, Kreinsen received the 2014 DeOrmond Tuss McLaughry Award, presented annually to the outstanding college football scholar-athlete in Western Mass. He was also a member of the National Football Foundation Hampsire Honor Society. He has gotten a thorough education in Amherst. “There is more structure to the day-to-day,” Kreinsen said. “It’s more of a livelihood. You realize that more when you’re coaching than when you’re playing. It’s a much different dynamic.” Page 2 of 2 - He is responsible for the breakdown of practice and game film, statistical reports detailing offensive production, coordinating the scout team, and assisting day-to-day recruiting operations. He does all of this while pursuing a master’s degree in labor studies, a degree he hopes to finish by next fall. “I was definitely thrown right into the fire,” Kreinsen said. “I had to learn a lot on the fly and balance grad school at the same time. There’s a lot more detail. Everything’s just bigger, and we run the pro-style system. So it’s a step up.” As an assistant offensive line coach to Shane Waldron, a 2002 Tufts alum and former assistant coach for both the Patriots and Notre Dame, Kreinsen is learning at the feet of coaches with an NFL pedigree. Whipple also spent time in the NFL. He was the UMass head coach from 1998 through 2003 before serving as an assistant with the Steelers, Eagles, University of Miami, and Browns. He returned to UMass last year to help revive a program that had undergone growing pains in its jump to college football’s highest level. “I’m so grateful to Shane for giving me this opportunity — he was the first to interview me,” Kreinsen said. “He has high expectations, and I do my best to meet them.” As for being around Whipple, who won a Div. I-AA national title at UMass in 1998, Kreinsen called it “a treat. He’s a great coach, great motivator.” And Kreinsen has been a part of it. Like he was at Notre Dame, on game days Kreinsen is usually up in the booth. “I’m just trying to relay what I see,” he said, “just trying to confirm what Shane sees and help with adjustments.” He added, “I love working with the offensive linemen. They’re my kind of people.” Right now, Kreinsen’s a busy young man. This is the life he was looking for. “It’s a livelihood,” he said. “Football is the most important thing to all the coaches and players when we are in the building. I’m just trying to get my degree, and take that next step.” And maybe, just maybe, those steps will come with more camera time.
