(2/2) Well, now watch this Trump pump up video for the #USMNT ! Get ready. #USAvMEX kicks tomorrow on @FS1 ! https://t.co/1mfnfZiqTo — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) October 9, 2015 Trump even retweeted it from his personal account. Good luck to the US Men?s National Team in tomorrow?s CONCACAF Cup vs. Mexico! It should be a great game! https://t.co/nH31afzjNz — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2015 But American fans weren’t too pleased with Trump being used as a posterboy for U.S. soccer, given his history of controversial remarks about Mexico and its people. Former U.S. Men’s National Team member Herculez Gomez tweeted his disdain for the ad. Go home FoxSoccer, you?re drunk #Fail https://t.co/ChfTL9bLA3 — herculez gomez (@herculezg) October 9, 2015 I?m 100% positive that this view is not shared by all @FOXSoccer employees or @ussoccer fans. We?ve come too far to stoop to this. — herculez gomez (@herculezg) October 9, 2015 And The American Outlaws , a fan group of the team , just had one word for the network. — The American Outlaws (@AmericanOutlaws) October 9, 2015 The USA plays Mexico October 10 at the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, CA. Kick off is at 9:30 p.m. EST. The game will be broadcast on Fox Sports 1, Univision, and UDN. Keep an eye out for some of these future stars of the USMNT tonight: Previous -- of -- Next Emerson Hyndman, 19, midfielder: Left the United States at the age of 15 to join Fulham FC's youth academy, and has worked his way up from there. Four years later, and Hyndman captained the U-20 side in this year's World Cup and is getting regular play for Fulham's first team. He may lack size, but he has huge potential. MICHAEL BRADLEY/AFP/Getty Images Previous -- of -- Next Gyasi Zardes, 23, midfielder: He may be the oldest on the list, but his slow ascention was quite deliberate. Now a firm member of Klinsmann's squad and the LA Galaxy, his energy in the Gold Cup game against Haiti was transformative. At just 23 years old, he’s got a lot of time to grow and lead a team of younger players onto the world stage. Jens Dresling/AP Previous -- of -- Next Rubio Rubin, 19, forward: Aside from a great name, Rubin is another of the European based players to already be getting regular playing time for his club in the Netherlands. The country has produced some of the greatest players ever, so the opportunity is there for the dogged forward to join their ranks, but play in a red, white, and blue jersey. Phil Walter/Getty Images Previous -- of -- Next Julian Green, 20, midfielder: His past year in Germany may have been patchy - he only played nine times last season after being loaned to Hamburger SV by Bayern Munich - but most will remember him for his first touch goal against Belgium in last year’s World Cup. Bayern believes in him, and regular playing time at another loan club will boost his confidence. Elsa/Getty Images Previous -- of -- Next Cameron Carter-Vickers, 17, defender: Carter-Vickers already has many of the physcial traits of a central defender, and possesses a cool enough head at the age of 17 to be named captain of Tottenham's U-21 squad. A growing rock at the back with a lot of longevity fo the U.S team.
