The Green Archers won, 72-64. (Ernie U. Sarmiento)\nTeng had 20 points, six rebounds and three assists as La Salle bounced back from Sunday’s 81-79 loss to co-leader University of Santo Tomas (UST) for a 5-4 record, half-game ahead of rival Ateneo (4-4) for third.\n“Hard-fought game,” said La Salle coach Juno Sauler. “We had a good lead in the first half, UE got back but it’s a good thing the players were able to get their composure back and finish the game well.”\nAmid a strict policy imposed by the Big Dome security that irked several members of the media, La Salle’s lead was threatened in the third when UE used a 14-4 run capped off by a Chris Javier basket to pull within 45-44.\nThe Archers slowly regained their form behind Teng, Rivero and Muyang to lead 55-50 entering the fourth before a 9-0 blast turned a 62-58 lead into 71-58 on Joshua Torralba’s three with two minutes remaining.\nThe win, however, failed to satisfy Teng, who thought La Salle lacked energy.\n“Feeling ko kulang kami sa energy,” Teng admitted. “UE showed more effort in their pressing and fastbreak.”\nThomas Torres backstopped Teng on offense with 15 points and grabbed five boards. Muyang became a revelation off the bench for the Archers, falling a point shy of a double-double with nine points and 11 rebounds in 22 minutes.\nRenz Palma and Javier scored 14 points each for the Red Warriors, who dropped to seventh place at 3-6.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:41:07.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
