We are not in position where we are competitive really in any phase of the game.\"\nUNT lost each of its games this season by at least 14 points and has dropped six straight dating to last season. The loss to Portland State, a team UNT paid a $425,000 appearance fee to bring in, was the final point in that evaluation process.\nThe previous largest margin of defeat for an FBS team against an FCS school came in 1981 when Penn lost to Lehigh 58-0.\nVillarreal said that the decision to part ways with McCarney was not one the university made quickly. It was part of a longer term evaluation process\nMcCarney finished with a 22-32 record in four-plus seasons with the Mean Green. He was not originally scheduled to speak after the game, but called back reporters to share his feelings after Villarreal announced he had decided to make a change.\n\"First of all, I thank God many, many times for the opportunity I got to come here to North Texas,\" McCarney said. \"It was a blessing and some of the best days I have had in my life. I will cherish them.\n\"I don't know if we could have been embraced or supported better than we were when we took this job. There are a lot of things we are proud of in trying to change the culture and changing the program around.\"\nVillarreal said he would meet with UNT's assistant coaches on Sunday to determine how the program will proceed the remainder of the season. UNT offensive coordinator Mike Canales went 2-3 as the Mean Green's interim coach at the end of the 2010 season after the school fired then head coach Todd Dodge.\nMcCarney took over a program that had not won more than three games in any of the previous six seasons when he arrived and immediately went 5-7 in his first season in 2011. The Mean Green reached their pinnacle under McCarney two seasons later when they won nine games and beat UNLV in the Heart of Dallas Bowl at the end of the 2013 season.\nUNT signed McCarney to an extension through the 2019 season shortly after the bowl win. Villarreal said the school would come to terms with McCarney on a buyout in the next few days and said parting ways with a coach who led UNT to one of its best seasons in program history was not easy.\n\"Coach McCarney has done an unbelievable job taking us to some of the highest points we have ever been,\" Villarreal said while also crediting McCarney with helping improve the academic standing of UNT's football program during his tenure.\nUNT was unable to build on that season at a time Villarreal believed the school has more in place than ever before to become a consistently successful program. The school opened Apogee Stadium, a $78 million venue in 2011 and made the move from the Sun Belt Conference to Conference USA in 2013.\n\"It's a shame. It really is,\" McCarney said. \"We had it rolling and couldn't sustain it. That is really hard to swallow.\"\nMORE COVERAGE\nZach Orr, a former linebacker for McCarney, took to Twitter to air his frustrations about his alma mater's \"embarrassing\" performance against Portland State.
