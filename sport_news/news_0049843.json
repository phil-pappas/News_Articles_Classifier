He was addressing a meeting of HPCC secretaries here today in commemoration of the 125th anniversary of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru which was attended by HPCC eneral secretaries Harbhajan Singh Bhajji, Ravi Thakur and Kishori Lal. The meeting was attended 15 HPCC secretaries who submitted their reports on the work done by them in their respective areas that have been assigned to them and the problems faced by them. Sukhu said the growing incidents of religious intolerance had jolted the intellectual class in the country and many poets and writers had returned their Sahitya Akademy Awards to show their resentment against Modi government’s failure to reign in divisive forces in the country. “It is the duty of the Centre to protect cultural ethos and maintain peace across the country but PM Modi had tried to evade government’s responsibilities by saying that the Centre had no role in such incidents,” he said, adding that the incidents of communal intolerance in the country were examples of Centre government’s inability to reign in divisive forces in the country. He termed Jawahar Lal Nehru as the architect of Modern India who had laid the foundation of the country on the ideals of socialism, secularism and democratic values. “But now these ideals seemed to have been forgotten by the Modi government which is the reason that incidents of communal violence and religious intolerance are growing in the country,” he said. He also condemned the incident in which one person was beaten to death by right wing activists in Sirmaur district while four persons were arrested for illegal smuggling of cattles. He urged the state to take strict action against guilty persons who had beaten one person to death and also called for taking measures to stop illegal smuggling of cattle smuggling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:12:29.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
