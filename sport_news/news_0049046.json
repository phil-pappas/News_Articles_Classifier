They might have a few.\nIf the Dodgers wind up traveling to New York for the start of their NL Division Series against the Mets – and back if the best-of-five series reaches a decisive Game 5 – they can look back at the 2-8 stretch that preceded their division-clinching victory Tuesday night. That September stall could end up costing them home-field advantage in the NLDS.\n“I just think it’s human nature,” said Dodgers manager Don Mattingly, acknowledging he was not satisfied with his team’s “energy” during a home series against the Arizona Diamondbacks and then a series at Coors Field. The Dodgers split a four-game series with the Diamondbacks then were swept in a three-game series by the last-place Colorado before traveling to San Francisco.\n“It’s what happens down the stretch,” Mattingly said. “We had a little bit of a lead. You’re playing teams you’re supposed to beat. It’s just the way it is. You see it all the time. You see it every year.”\nDuring that 10-game stretch, Mattingly gave extensive playing time to some players who might not be on the team’s postseason roster (outfielders Chris Heisey, Justin Ruggiano and Scott Schebler, in particular). Half of the games were started by pitchers unlikely to pitch in the first round of the playoffs – Mike Bolsinger, Carlos Frias and either Brett Anderson or Alex Wood (whichever is relegated to fourth starter in the opening round).\nBut Mattingly defended his lineup choices, saying it was not a case of taking his foot off the gas down the stretch.\n“Not at all,” he said. “There were certain things I couldn’t do during that stretch (because of injuries). Having a little bit of a cushion allowed us during that stretch to say ‘We gotta give JT (Justin Turner) some days. If we don’t we’re going to lose him for the long haul.’ Same thing with Adrian (Gonzalez). Things like that.\n“There were times when there were guys who got a day who, if we didn’t have a little bit of a cushion and it was a one-game situation, right down to the wire, they would have forced it and we would have forced it. But that wasn’t the case. We were definitely putting lineups out there I thought were good lineups and expected to win. We just didn’t play well enough to win.”\nAs a result, the Dodgers (88-69) went into Wednesday a game behind the Mets (89-68) – but really two games. The Mets won the season series, 4-3, and will have home-field if the teams finish the regular season with identical records.\n“Well, I think you’ve got to be able to win everywhere,” Mattingly said.\nBut he couldn’t deny the value of the home-field advantage. The Dodgers (36-43) are the only National League playoff team with a losing record on the road this season. In the past two postseasons, the Dodgers have gone 1-6 on the road (at Atlanta and St. Louis), 5-2 at home.\n“There you go,” Mattingly said to that statistic. “That’s a good reason to be at home.”\nHe said he will make out lineups over the next four days with an eye toward catching the Mets.\n“I don’t really plan on backing off as far as throwing any old lineup out there and letting anybody go,” Mattingly said. “We’re going to play our guys – outside of people that need rest like an Adrian. We want to make sure we take care of him. Howie (Kendrick), he’s getting better but we still have to watch him. JT has needed some days. Things like that we’re going to do what’s right for those guys.\n“Other than that – keep playing.”\nMattingly said Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw will make their final regular-season starts on turn Saturday and Sunday. Kershaw’s start will be shortened, though Mattingly will be mindful of Kershaw’s chance to reach 300 strikeouts. He is at 294. No pitcher has had a 300-K season since Randy Johnson in 2002.\nGreinke, meanwhile, skipped a start and had nine days’ rest before his most recent outing because of a sore right calf. If he starts Game 2 of the NLDS, he would have another extended break (one week) so Mattingly said Greinke “wants more of a regular start” Saturday.\nAROUND THE BASES \nGreinke was named the winner of the 10th annual Roy Campanella Award. The award is voted on by the Dodgers players and coaching staff and recognizes the player who “best exemplifies the spirit and leadership of” the Hall of Fame catcher. Kershaw won it the previous two seasons. … Mattingly said left-hander Brett Anderson’s final regular-season start Thursday will likely be an abbreviated one. Anderson will earn another $350,000 bonus if he completes 21/3 innings and would set a career-high if he finishes three innings. But he needs to go 71/3 to reach 180 innings and claim another $400,000 bonus. Anderson has already added $1.65million in bonuses to his $10million contract.\nContact the writer: bplunkett@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:21:36.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
