That figure does not include any money earned through summer camps or academic performance bonuses.\nIn the nine years since Brands was hired to replace Jim Zalesky, Iowa has won three NCAA championships (in 2008, ’09 and ’10). Brands has compiled a 163-16-1 dual record in that time and has won four Big Ten titles, including a co-championship last season with Ohio State. The Hawkeyes finished runner-up to Ohio State at the NCAAs, marking Iowa’s eighth consecutive top-four national finish.\nHAWK CENTRAL\nRecord ticket sales for Iowa outdoor wrestling dual\nRead //dmreg.co/1KPT8fy", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc40ae7842867ac77f590f9991f721fbc6503350/c=46-0-1425-1839&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/01/IAGroup/HawkCentral/635793084816882943-BrandsContract.jpg", "http://dmreg.co/1KPT8fy", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//dmreg.co/1KPT8fy&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7535ab8ca0963616503503952a43a6b876c01466/c=248-185-1554-1491/local/-/media/2015/10/01/IAGroup/HawkCentral/635792976856634855-IOW-0806-wrestling-kinnick-04-1-.jpg", "http://www.hawkcentral.com/story/sports/college/iowa/wrestling/2015/10/01/record-ticket-sales-iowa-outdoor-wrestling-dual/73144884/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//dmreg.co/1KPT8fy&text=Tom%20Brands%20signs%203-year%20contract%20extension&via=DMRegister"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:22:19.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
