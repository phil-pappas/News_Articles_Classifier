Earlier this month, Chung was banned for six years by the ethics committee of FIFA, which also suspended FIFA head Sepp Blatter, secretary-general Jerome Valcke and European football body UEFA president Michel Platini for 90 days, reports Xinhua. On his newly-launched blog, Chung said the ban handed down by FIFA’s independent ethics committee had forced him to miss the October 26 deadline for filing his candidacy. “Because of the committee’s unjust sanctions… it is now time to officially withdraw my candidacy for the next FIFA president,” he wrote. “As FIFA leaked information to the media, portraying me as an unethical person, I felt I was left naked, helpless to defend myself, as they repeatedly cut me with a sharp knife.” Chung had petitioned a Swiss court for an injunction against the ban so that he could maintain his candidacy pending his appeal to FIFA’s appeal committee and to the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). But the court rejected his petition. Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:18:00.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
