But if you never qualify, or if you do qualify and can't go, there is still so much you've accomplished to take pride in.\nLiving in a small Oregon logging town will make a little girl dream big.\nBooks gave me a glimpse into worlds beyond my reach. I would sit in my room on rainy Saturday afternoons reading about far-off places and plotting my escape once I was old enough to buy my plane tickets. I was convinced that croissants would taste better if eaten on the Left Bank in Paris (I was right). I wanted to walk in the footsteps of history, searching for ghosts still lingering on cobblestone roads and behind high stone fortress walls.\nAs soon as I graduated from high school I began making plans. I worked three jobs in college, not just to pay tuition, but to also give myself the gift of travel for graduation. I squirreled away money and poured over travel brochures as if I were an explorer commissioned to discover new lands.\nObtaining my passport was one of the most exciting days in my young life. Getting that first stamp was exhilarating, and I immediately began testing theories I’d concocted in my Roseburg, Oregon, bedroom. I discovered that European chocolate is better. The lights are brighter in Paris. And I think I heard Anne Boleyn was whispering to me inside the Tower of London (probably telling me that life is short, eat more chocolate).\nBut I also discovered something completely unexpected. Something that I continue to experience even as an adult sailing to new countries. The travel is great, but it’s the planning and anticipation that excites me most of all. Saving my pennies, devouring travel guides and packing my suitcase are more thrilling than a drive through the Scottish hills.\nSometimes I build something up so big in my mind that disappointment is inevitable. The Mona Lisa was one of those somethings. In my mind, I’d built her up to be bigger than life, but in reality she was just so, well, small. The anticipation of seeing her far outweighed the experience. I don’t regret making the trek to see her, but I realized then that so much in life isn’t as big as it seems, literally and figuratively in Mona Lisa’s case.\nAlmost as soon as I embarked on my first real run (i.e. one not required by a gym teacher), the Boston build-up began. Tales of the excitement at Athlete’s Village in Hopkinton, the history-making runs of some of the world’s greatest athletes, the infamous Heartbreak Hill and the hope of only one-mile-to-go at the Citgo sign swirled together making Boston an absolute “must-do” race. Having never run a marathon and not really understanding the effort it would take to make it to Boston, I began dreaming and plotting my way there, nevertheless.\nAnd I did it. With 55 seconds to spare, I qualified to run the 2009 Boston Marathon. I bought plane tickets, paid the registration fee and booked the hotel. Then I got injured. And the injury got worse. And I got real. I dropped out a month before race day. Disappointment isn’t a big enough word to describe how I felt, but I was able to turn that disappointment into drive, got myself better and made it back to Boston for 2010. All the frustration of the previous year had turned a “must-do” race into the “race of a lifetime” race. In other words, I’d built it up big time.\nWas it wonderful? Yes. Was it emotional? Given the long road it took to get there, yes. Was it all it was hyped up to be? Well\nWhat makes Boston special isn’t the course. It’s not the most beautiful course or the most challenging. The crowds are pretty spectacular, but I’ve heard crowds just as loud and colorful in New York. No, what makes Boston special is the effort it takes to get there. Feeling a part of an exclusive community with a steep membership requirement is a huge rush. It’s the only marathon in the country that accepts runners solely based on a previous marathon time — charity runners excluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:56:19.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
