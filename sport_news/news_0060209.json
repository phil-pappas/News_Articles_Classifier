Special photo by William Lofton slideshow ROSWELL — Friday night’s anticipated matchup featuring undefeated Region 5 teams Roswell and Walton turned into a lopsided affair as the third-ranked Hornets rolled to a 48-14 victory over the seventh-ranked Raiders at Ray Manus Stadium.Quintarius Neely threw for 287 yards and five touchdowns in the first half as Roswell (5-0, 3-0) led 34-14 at halftime. He completed 19 of 27 passes, including touchdown tosses of 12, 11, 62, 24 and 55 yards to three different receivers.Neely finished the game 24-of-36 for 371 yards and rushed six times for 32 yards.Kendrick Jackson grabbed nine catches for 133 yards and a touchdown, while Jayden Comma caught five passes for 121 yards and two scores. Running back Sheldon Evans, who rushed 21 times for 146 yards and two touchdowns, also had two receptions for 40 yards and a touchdown.Roswell totaled 569 yards of offense, compared to 248 for Walton (5-1, 3-1).“We didn’t react well to what Roswell was doing and our defense was giving out,” Walton coach Mo Dixon said, “so it’s back to the drawing board. We didn’t see anything different from Roswell that wasn’t on the tape. They’re a very good program, especially on defense.”Walton running back K.K. Brooks entered the game with nine touchdowns and a 5.4-yard-per-carry average, but he was held to 11 rushes for 20 yards and a score. The Raiders rushed for minus-18 yards overall as the Hornets notched eight sacks and 38 yards on tackles for loss.Brooks did help in the receiving game, however. He had three catches for 139 yards and weaved his way through the Roswell defense for a 72-yard touchdown reception that left Walton trailing 20-7 early in the second quarter.The Hornets answered immediately, though, behind a nine-play, 90-yard drive capped by Neely’s 24-yard touchdown pass to Evans.Walton quarterback Addison Shoup was pressured the entire game with several Roswell players picking up sacks and forcing Shoup into hurried throws. Roswell also recovered a fumble off a kickoff that led to its second touchdown of the first quarter.“If you miss a tackle on these guys, they can break it,” Dixon said. “Roswell is the No. 1 team in the region now, and everybody else is fighting for second.”Walton was in the game initially after stuffing a Roswell drive at the 5-yard line on three straight plays. The Raiders’ offense couldn’t turn that effort into a score, however, as they went three-and-out and their possession.Roswell was rarely denied a scoring opportunity again. The Hornets found the end zone on their next five possessions, staking their 34-14 halftime advantage.Roswell led 20-0 following Neely’s 62-yard touchdown throw to Comma on their first play at the start of the second period, and it added two more scores in the frame. Neely’s 55-yard touchdown throw to Jackson put the Hornets in front 34-7 with 2:54 left.A 61-yard pass from Shoup to Brooks led to Brooks’ 3-yard touchdown run with 1:08 remaining in the first half.Walton was held to 52 yards in the second half. Many of the reserves on both teams entered the game in the fourth quarter.Shoup completed 11 for 21 passes for 223 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.“We got frustrated defensively, so it was clear I had to make some changes,” Dixon said. “Roswell’s a tough team defensively.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:51:58.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
