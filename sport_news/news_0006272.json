Sam Aghahowa, Sam Kim and Evens Raphael lead young squad in Bronx A division. The Lehman Lions worked on short passes for about 20 minutes last Friday during their final tune-up before the regular season.\nThe drill seemed simple enough: tap a rolling ball toward a teammate a few feet away. Still, some players had a tough time controlling the bouncing ball with one touch. Others couldn't get it back to their teammate with accuracy.\nThat is why Patrick Straw forced his young team - which he calls the deepest he's ever coached - to work on it. If the Lions can perfect their short touch-passing game, the eighth-year coach said, it will take them a long way toward the Bronx 'A' title.\n\"We're going to rely on speed and ball control this year,\" Straw said. \" Columbus is the team to beat this year, but I think we are right there.\"\nThe Lions are coming off a third-place finish, their lowest in four seasons in the Bronx 'A' division. But captain Evens Raphael isn't worried about the regular season; he says that Lehman can make noise in the playoffs.\n\"We're going to be good,\" said Raphael , a four-year starter who will play sweeper this fall. \"I can't wait to get back to the playoffs.\"\nSenior Jose Garcia takes over for standout goalkeeper Sheldon Parkinson , who is playing at Mercy College . Straw expects big things from Garcia, who has enough athleticism, the coach says, to cover plenty of ground.\nKeivom/News Lions (from l.) Sam Aghahowa, Sam Kim and Evens Raphael lead young squad in Bronx A division. The Lions also need Sam Kim to regain the scoring touch he had on display as a freshman. Kim, a junior midfielder, scored 12 goals his freshman year but just four last season.\n\"He's a quality player,\" said senior striker Sam Aghahowa . \"We know he's going to bounce back. He's going to be fine.\"\nAghahowa and Raphael could be the team's go-to scorers, Straw said, but he needs them to control the ball in the backfield to set up Lehman's front line.\nThe senior captains both say they're fine about passing up the scoring spotlight to benefit the team. After all, passing is key for Lehman's long-term success.\n\"It's best for the team,\" Aghahowa said. \"It's fine with me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:04:15.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
