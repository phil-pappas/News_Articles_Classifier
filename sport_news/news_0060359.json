Those Buckeyes weren't eligible for the postseason, though, due to NCAA infractions.\nJames Jones, John Kuhn and 14 other Green Bay Packers were part of the 2011 team that began the season 13-0. That group learned the hard way that fast starts mean little if you don't close strong, as well.\nSo as the Packers headed to their bye week with a perfect 6-0 record, they did so with a bevy of emotions. Green Bay was thrilled to have the best record in the NFC, but also fully understood its season remained in its preliminary stages.\n\"We've won six in a row, but there's a lot of work to do,\" Jones said. \"We all know it don't mean nothing if we can't finish the season off the way we want to do it.\n\"You've got to win games to get to the playoffs. That's what we're trying to do.\"\nSo far, the Packers have done exactly that. And if history is an indicator, big things await the 2015 Packers.\nIn Green Bay's long and storied history, it has now started a season 6-0 eight different times.\nThe first six Packers teams that began 6-0 all won World Championships. The 2011 Packers started the year 13-0, went 15-1 in the regular season, then lost in the NFC divisional playoffs.\nThe 2015 book still has several chapters waiting to be written. But players like Linsley were stunned to learn that six of Green Bay's first seven teams that opened 6-0 won titles.\n\"That's amazing to think about,\" Linsley said. \"But that's kind of the other side of sports statistics is that it means absolutely nothing. 6-0 is a great start, puts us in a great position. But in the long run it means nothing. Unless we go 19-0 and win the Super Bowl, 6-0 is just a great start. Nothing else.\"\nPackers right guard T.J. Lang agreed.\n\"Obviously sitting there at 6-0, there's a (lot) of football left,\" Packers right guard T.J. Lang said. \"We haven't won anything yet. We haven't reached any of our goals yet.\n\"I think it's more excitement. When you watch the film, you wish you would have done some things better. But the fact of the matter is we've got a lot of momentum on our side right now. Coach always talks about grit. And this is really the first time I felt that was one of our best characteristics as a football team.\"\nGreen Bay started 6-0 each season between 1929-'31. Championships were awarded back then based on best winning percentage, and the Packers' 34-5-2 overall record in that time gave them three straight championships.\nThe 1929 Packers were a magnificent 12-0-1 and outscored their opponents by a whopping 198-22. Green Bay had eight shutouts that season and nobody scored more than six points against that team.\nGreen Bay was 10-3-1 in 1930 for a .769 winning percentage. The New York Giants were 13-4 that season (.765), giving the Packers the title by percentage points.\nGreen Bay made it a three-peat in 1931, when it went 12-2 and edged the Portsmouth Spartans (11-3) for the title. The Packers held a 291-87 scoring edge that year and allowed just three foes to score in double figures.\nIn 1944, the Packers also started the season 6-0, finished 9-2, and were crowned league champion.\nThe 1962 Packers, meanwhile, are still considered by many as the best team in franchise history. That team began the year 10-0 on its way to a 13-1 regular season.\nThe Packers defeated the New York Giants, 16-7, to win their second straight NFL championship. And Green Bay outscored its opponents, 415-148, a margin of nearly 3-to-1.\nOnly a loss to Detroit on Thanksgiving stopped the Packers from achieving perfection.\n\"That was a great football team, probably the best of any we had there,\" safety Willie Wood said. \"I look back now and it's incredible how close we were to going unbeaten. That was an incredible football team. There won't be many like that one again.\"\nDuring a 2010 interview, former quarterback Bart Starr agreed with Wood.\n\"That probably was the best year we had during the Glory Years,\" said Starr, who led the Packers to five championships between 1961-'67. \"Everything just kind of aligned right that season.\n\"We avoided injuries that season. It was our fourth year with Vince (Lombardi), so we all knew just what he wanted. And a lot of our core guys were in their prime. It was an incredible season.\"\nGreen Bay also began the 1965 season 6-0 on its way to a title. The Packers finished that regular season with a 10-3-1 record, edged Baltimore, 13-10, in a controversial Western Conference Championship, then toppled Jim Brown and Cleveland in the NFL championship.\nGreen Bay's 2011 team was the only one in team history to open a season 6-0 and not win a championship. Those Packers hit a high-water mark of 13-0, before losing in Kansas City and then dropping their playoff opener.\n\"That was tough,\" Kuhn said of the 2011 loss. \"That's why you try and keep this whole thing in perspective.\n\"We're 6-0 and that's great. But it's just step one. We're now halfway through the second quarter and we're proud about our performance so far. But there's a lot more work ahead.\"\nThat's for sure.\nGreen Bay ranks 20th in passing offense and tied for 11th in total offense. The Packers are fifth in points per game (27.3), but they were also first in that category a year ago (30.4).\n\"This isn't the same team as last year when we were scoring 50 points a game,\" Lang said. \"But we can still be successful and get the job done. In the past it didn't seem like we were winning too many of those close games when (stuff) wasn't going right. We just kind of threw away the game plan and got creative and tried doing something new.\n\"But just being able to stick with what we've got and going out there and doing whatever it takes to get the win says a lot about this offense. We're undefeated and we're 6-0. There's a lot of optimism there. We're still winning these games when we're not playing at our full potential.\"\nGreen Bay's defense was torched for 503 yards by San Diego quarterback Philip Rivers. That dropped the Packers to 11th in passing defense (236.5) and 15th in total defense (355.0).\nThe most important statistic remains scoring defense, though. And Green Bay ranks third in that category, allowing 16.8 points per game after giving up 21.8 points per game last year.\n\"You know you look at the style of wins we're having, hopefully that means something later on down the road,\" Packers linebacker Clay Matthews said. \"These aren't 42-0 blowouts. These aren't games in which it's over, like you saw you in the second half of the season last year. Sometimes offense has to step up, sometimes defense does, and special teams.\n\"Real gritty wins, especially against good teams. It's good to see that. Hopefully that builds character, and hopefully that means something moving forward. But 6-0 I think it's the second time in 50 years we've done it here, so that's a big accomplishment.\"\nThe NFC is wide open.\nTwo-time defending conference champion Seattle is already four games behind Green Bay and lost the head-to-head battle. Carolina (5-0), Atlanta (5-1) and Arizona (4-2) seem to be the greatest threats to Green Bay, but the Packers know how quickly things can change.\nThe 2011 New York Giants were 7-7 at one point, snuck into the playoffs, then knocked Green Bay off on its way to winning Super Bowl XLVI.\nThe 2010 Packers were 8-6 late in the year, then got hot at the right time and won the Super Bowl XLV title.\nThose teams both showed that fast starts aren't mandatory. Fantastic finishes are what matters most.\nBut the 2015 Packers are hoping to have both.\n\"We'll take them any way we can,\" quarterback Aaron Rodgers said of winning games. \"We've had six of them this year, they've been all different types of wins. We've had pretty ones, we've had to grind it out.\n\"(San Diego) was kind of a hang on there at the end. They all count the same. We're going to need them down the stretch.\"\nIn what promises to be a thrilling second half.\nFAST STARTS A look at Packers teams that have started a season with at least a 6-0 record.
