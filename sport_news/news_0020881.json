Associated Press \nIllinois men's basketball coach John Groce talks to reporters at the team's media day in Champaign on Thursday. Buy Now \nCHICAGO – Another injury has threatened to handcuff the start of the Illini basketball season. \nKendrick Nunn suffered an injury to his left thumb at practice on Tuesday and was unable to make his scheduled appearance Thursday at the Big Ten Conference men’s basketball media day event. \nCoach John Groce said Nunn was seeing a hand specialist Thursday morning to determine the extent of the injury. \n“I don’t know a whole lot at this point,” said Groce, who came to Chicago with junior Malcolm Hill as his only player representative. “It swelled up a little bit and he’s seeing the specialist this morning.” \nGroce did not return to Champaign after the media day event and instead went on a recruiting trip. A university spokesman said they did not anticipate providing an update on Nunn’s condition until today. \nHill said Nunn told him the injury happened when he reached to make a steal. \n“He stayed on the court so I don’t really think it’s an ugly injury,” Hill said. “In fact he didn’t even notice it until the next day so I’m hoping it’s not really that bad of an injury. It sucks, but like coach Groce says, it’s next man up.” \nIllinois was already without three players who might have been in the top seven of the rotation. \nSenior point guard Tracy Abrams will miss the entire season for the second straight year, this time due to a ruptured Achilles tendon. \nSophomore power forward Leron Black, the MVP of the team’s summer European trip, is out at least a few more weeks after surgery for a meniscus tear. And freshman sharp-shooter Jalen Coleman-Lands has been cleared for basketball activities but is bring brought along slowly after missing the entire summer to rest a stress fracture in his leg. \nGroce said the team’s morale remains upbeat. \n“They don’t have much of a choice because it is what it is,” he said. \n“Leron is doing well. He’s off crutches and is doing some cardio. The doctor said it was evident his meniscus was torn for a long time. \n“What I worry about is the growth of the team and our ability to improve and get better. You don’t just snap your fingers. Coleman-Lands didn’t participate in the summer and it’s going to take a little bit of time. That’s what is on my mind: How do I accelerate our growth to make sure we’re getting better through the challenge of multiple injuries?” \nHill was asked if he ever feels the entire team should be wrapped in bubble wrap. \n“We need to find something because this is ridiculous,” he said. “But we’re not to the point of hanging our heads about it. When we do that, that’s when we’re defeated. \n“Things like this happen,” Hill said. “It’s a challenge we have to face. I’m just glad it’s happening before the season.” \nIllinois’ only public exhibition game is Nov. 8 against Illinois-Springfield. The regular season opener is Nov. 13 against North Florida. All of the November “home” games will be played at the Prairie Capital Convention Center in Springfield while the current stage of the State Farm Center renovation project is being wrapped up. \nHill, who said he’s taking on a bigger leadership role, said two fifth-year transfers have helped make him feel good about the direction of the team. \n“The new guys are doing a really good job of figuring it out,” Hill said. “Mike Thorne is a really good scorer down low. And Khalid Lewis has been great. Those are really good guys.” \nThorne is a 6-11, 270-pound center who transferred from Charlotte. Lewis is a 6-3 point guard who transferred from LaSalle. \nNOTES – Maryland guard Melo Trimble was named the Big Ten’s preseason Player of the year as voted on by a media panel. He is joined on the preseason first-team by James Blackmon and Yogi Ferrell from Indiana, Jarrod Uthoff from Iowa, Jake Layman from Maryland, Caris LeVert from Michigan, Denzel Valentine from Michigan State, A.J. Hammons from Purdue as well as Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig from Wisconsin. \n. . . Former Illini player and assistant coach Rob Judson is now a full-time assistant coach at Indiana. Judson had been Indiana’s director of basketball operations, but was promoted when Steve McLain left to become head coach at Illinois-Chicago. That means Judson will be able to recruit and coach full-time. \nJudson played at Illinois from 1976-80 and was an assistant coach at Illinois from 1996-2001. He was also an assistant coach at Northern Illinois, Bradley and Illinois State and was head coach at Northern Illinois from 2001-2007. \n. . . Maryland is the preseason pick to win the Big Ten women’s championship. A media poll picked the top three and selected Ohio State to finish second and Michigan State third. Ohio State guard Kelsey Mitchell is the preseason Player of the Year. \nmtupper@herald-review.com|(217) 421-7983", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:45:54.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
