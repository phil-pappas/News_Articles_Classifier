He, along with Deputy Commissioner NK Solanki, Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Sant Lal Pachar, was cleaning the ground at Panchayat Bhawan, when he said: “Ye Modi pata nahi ke ke karwa ke maanega (Don’t know what all Modi will make us do).” There was silence for a few seconds followed by peals of laughter. The minister then noticed his comments were perhaps caught on film. “Record to nahi kar rahe. Marwa na dena (I hope you are not recording it. See, it does not harm me),” he said looking towards the video. The video has since gone viral on the social media and the story has been shown on some news channels. A copy of the video recording is with The Tribune. Sirsa Youth Congress president Anandvir Singh Gillankhera said, “This shows how serious the government and its ministers are about campaigns launched by Modi. The Congress has been saying the BJP government does not have any programme for people except for enacting ‘tamashas’ (dramas).” Vikas Chaudhary, Congress leader from Faridabad, commented on Facebook: “If this is how a BJP minister thinks of Modi, people can easily guess what kind of good governance is there in Haryana.” Jasbir Singh Jassa, state executive member of the INLD, said the minister’s conduct exposed the truth behind BJP’s seriousness on people’s issues. It is not the first time that Bedi has landed himself in the soup. In January, then Kurukshetra Civil Surgeon Vandana Bhatia had complained that Bedi had misbehaved with her over telephone. Bedi could not be contacted for his comments. At first, his personal assistant said the minister was busy in a programme. Later, he did not respond to calls made on his official mobile phone number.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:15:28.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
