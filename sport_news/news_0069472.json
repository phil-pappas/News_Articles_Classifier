(AP Photo/Tim Ireland) \nLONDON — Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor was inactive for the second week in a row, forced to sit out Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium with a left knee injury. \nTaylor started the first five games of the season for the Bills (3-3) but sprained a ligament in his left knee in the 14-13 win over Tennessee on Oct. 11. He practiced on Wednesday and said his knee was getting better, but coach Rex Ryan ruled him out on Thursday. \nEJ Manuel, who was inconsistent in last week's 34-21 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, will start Sunday. \nRunning back Karlos Williams, tackle Seantrel Henderson, wide receiver Percy Harvin, defensive tackle Kyle Williams, wide receiver Sammy Watkins and guard John Miller were also listed as inactive. \nFor the Jaguars (1-5), the inactives are wide receiver Marqise Lee, safety James Sample, running back Joe Banyard, linebacker James-Michael Johnson, linebacker Tyler Shatley, defensive end Chris Smith and tight end Clay Harbor. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:59:51.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
