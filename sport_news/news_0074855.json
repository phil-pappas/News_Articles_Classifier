Sale entered the game with 267 strikeouts and broke the mark set by Hall of Famer Ed Walsh in 1908 when he struck out 269 batters. \nSale became the third American League left-hander since 1972 to record at least 270 strikeouts in a season, joining David Price (2014) and Randy Johnson (1993, 1995, 1997). \nEntering play Friday, Sale led the AL in strikeouts and was second in the majors behind only Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw (294). \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:28:53.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
