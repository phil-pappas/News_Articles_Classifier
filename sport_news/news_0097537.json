He's listed as a three-star recruit on Scout and Rivals, and a two-star recruit on ESPN. \nAnderson's decision was extra special, as he committed on his 18th birthday. \nAfter playing his first two years at Wilson, Anderson transferred to Garfield last season. The 6-foot-6 senior helped Garfield to a Class 3A state title last year, scoring 17 points and grabbing 14 rebounds in the title game. A strong defensive player, Garfield coach Ed Haskins called Anderson the best post in the state, even though it is not technically his position. Garfield beats Beach for 3A hoops title \nLast season Anderson was Garfield's lead rebounder and second in scoring. He averaged 16.6 points, 10.3 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.1 steals in 29 games. Check out his highlights from last season here .
