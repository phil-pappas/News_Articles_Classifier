But later in the afternoon, Ohio State coach Urban Meyer removed the suspense by naming J.T. Barrett the starting quarterback for Saturday night's game. \n\"J.T has earned the right to start Saturday at Rutgers,\" Meyer said on the Big Ten coaches' teleconference. \nCardale Jones, who led the team to a national championship last year, beat Barrett in a preseason quarterback competition. Jones has started all seven games this season for the top-ranked Buckeyes, but he has been inconsistent and Barrett saw action in six games. \nBarrett's role increased in the past two games when he was used mostly as a rushing threat. Barrett had 23 carries for 164 yards and five touchdowns in the past two games. He also completed 6-of-6 passes for 56 yards and two touchdowns during that stretch. \n\"Just sheer production,\" Meyer said of why he made the quarterback change. \"It was a difficult decision, but red zone production and third down production were the two areas that made the difference and with the way he played Saturday.\" \nPLUS: Injured Rutgers receiver Leonte Carroo missed Tuesday's practice \nBarrett started the first 12 games last year before breaking his ankle in the regular season finale. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound Barrett shredded Rutgers in a 56-17 win last season . He completed 19-of-31 passes for 261 yards and three touchdowns, while rushing for 101 yards and two touchdowns on seven carries in the blowout. \n\"He's a dynamic athlete,\" Flood said. \"Somebody who can score from anywhere on the field. You have to pay so much attention to him in the run game that it creates 1-on-1s in the other parts of the field and that's the philosophy of their offense and it's really makes them tough to defend.\" \nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com .
