The two Indians are likely to be deported soon.\nThe detainees have been identified as Abu Sufiyan alias Asadullah Khan and Zainul Abideen alias Zahid Sheikh, says the Indian Express report. Sufiyan is from Hyderabad and in 2011-12 allegedly participated in meetings with terrorists from Bengaluru. These terrorists were later arrested for alleged links with the Lashkar-e-Taiba.\nThe case is being pursued by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Several accused are absconding and suspected to be hiding in Saudi Arabia.\nSufiyan was detained eight months ago and agencies were trying to obtain orders for his deportation, reports IE. The Bengaluru police uncovered Zainul Abideen's involvement while investigating into the explosives supply chain for the Indian Mujahideen (IM).\nHe is alleged to have procured explosives used in the Pune German Bakery blast and supplied it to Syed Afaque, the alleged main supplier of explosives to the IM. Indian Express sources said he was detained 20 days ago and is likely to be deported in a week.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:08:29.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
