And this was a good one, thanks largely to the hero of the moment. \nThe real acronym that bets fits Murphy might actually be G-O-A-T (and it has nothing to do with that poor, jinx-triggering billy goat named Murphy from 1945 Cubs lore). The Mets' Murphy, as of today, is putting on the greatest postseason display all-time for a position player. \nHe can't explain it. His manager, Terry Collins, can't explain it. No one can. \nBut Murphy has almost instantly transformed from a very good player into a mythical one. It's shocking, but at the same time, by now it's almost expected. He set a postseason record by hitting a home run in his sixth straight game and added three more hits in the 8-3 Mets victory over the Cubs that clinched the NLCS, sent the Mets to the third World Series in their history and earned Murphy very fair comparisons to the best players who ever graced a baseball field in October. \n\"I'll get a chance to tell people I played with Babe Ruth,\" Mets leadoff hitter Curtis Granderson said. \nWhile there was no \"Called Shot,\" here at Wrigley Field, the park where Ruth made that mythical on-field prediction, at this point it is becoming almost predictable. Murphy already had recorded two singles and a double when he smacked a Fernando Rodney offering into the center field bleachers to move past Carlos Beltran and into the record books for consecutives postseason games with a homer. \n\"I've not seen anything like it, I don't think, ever,\" Cubs manger Joe Maddon said. \"I saw (Barry) Bonds in the 2002 World Series where you did not want to throw a baseball to him as a pitcher. Right now, it's just incredible -- line drive to left, homer to right, homer to center. He looks like he's going to hit the ball hard on every single pitch. It's unusual to see a guy that locked in, and that locked in at this particular moment.\" \nThe thing is, he's being mentioned with some all-time great players, or at least superstars. Ruth. Bonds. Even the ex-Met Beltran (who isn't necessarily beloved for his Mets postseason performance, though he was great for the Astros the year before he got to New York). Murphy is a fine player, who hit 14 home runs this regular season, a nice total for a second baseman. He has seven so far in the postseason. \n\"He's tougher than Barry (bleeping) Bonds,\" Cubs catcher Miguel Montero said. \nTeammate Lucas Duda said he is starting to rub his bats against Murphy's in hopes it will rub off, and that seemed to pay off with Duda's big five-RBI game that took him out of a funk but still nowhere near Murphyland, which should not be confused with Wrigleyville. \nMurphy finished the NLCS with a .529 batting average, 1.294 slugging percentage and 1.852 OPS. The numbers seem made up. But he was that good. \n\"I don't know,\" Murphy said in explanation for his sudden burst of greatness. \"I can't explain it. It's just such a blessing to be able to contribute to what we've been able to do. I really can't explain it.\" \nHe shouldn't feel bad about that because nobody had an explanation, an inkling or even a clue. Duda said they are past the point of saying anything to Murphy on the bench. Their mouths just open, in unison, agape at the greatness that's on display. \nNobody can explain it, and nobody on the other teams knows what to do. He was intentionally walked once to get to Yoenis Cespedes , who outhomered him by 21 in the regular season, and that may be the wisest play now. \nHe's hitting everything and everyone. He's hit every type of pitch in every location and in every park. He's victimized the very best, with four of the seven homers coming against the certain top three finishes in Cy Young voting â€“ Clayton Kershaw (two home runs), Zack Greinke and Jake Arrieta (one apiece). \nFernando Rodney, who has had a few slings and arrows thrown his way this year, surrendered the Murphy homer in the clincher. But what stood out this time is that Murphy was looking for a change-up, he got a fastball, and he still hit it out. \n\"When I hit it, I said 'Oh my goodness,'\" Murphy said. \"I can't explain it.\" \nHe pumped his fist with panache as he rounded first base, putting his own version of an exclamation mark on the greatest postseason ever. \n\"I was really surprised it got out,\" he said. \nAt this point, though, there are no more surprises with this guy. The longer this goes on, the more expected it becomes. \nDaniel Murphy has become a folk hero during this Mets run to the World Series.
