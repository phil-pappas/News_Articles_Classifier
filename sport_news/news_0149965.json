For some lucky reason I've healed very well,\" Joseph said. \n\"A lot of hard work has gone into it. I want to play this game. It's do or die, it's massive, so I was really keen to get back for it. \n\"Last week was the huge week in terms of settling the injury down and getting some strength into it. I'm massively happy with the way that went. \n\"I've worked very hard with the physios every day for the majority of the day, trying to get it right. \n\"I felt very confident with the injury. It had progressed very well so I was very confident coming into this week.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:37:15.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
