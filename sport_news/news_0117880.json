Lee on Friday for final playoff spot in Class 7A, Region 2. Less than a year removed from the state championship game, the Lions are fighting for their playoff lives, and have a different sense of urgency this week. \n“It’s do or die. Our seniors, and our younger players, they realize that we need this win. And I think we can get it done,” running back Kingston Davis said. “It’s a mindset. You have to get focused the Saturday we start film. Guys can’t be playing around. Guys have to be serious each and every day about what they do.” \nDavis has been serious all season. Last week’s performance against Auburn was his seventh straight game with at least 140 rushing yards. \nThe Michigan commit ran 26 times for 170 yards and two touchdowns against Lee last season, as the Lions held on for a 21-19 victory – thanks to two missed extra points by the Generals. \nLess than a year removed from the state championship game, coach Chad Anderson knows what to expect from his players in big games. Despite its playoff implications, he said the game’s being treated like any other. \n“Our kids have played in big ball games. They’re accustomed to those situations. They’re going to play hard,” Anderson said. “It’s the same approach every week. People are going to play Prattville tough. It’s a big spot on most people’s calendars, it’s kind of a season maker for a lot of people to beat Prattville. Our kids are used to that too. You’ve just got to be ready for it. You can’t be shell shocked when somebody throws the kitchen sink at you or gives you their best game.” \nA win could mean three straight playoff appearances for the Lions, while a loss would mean they’d miss out for the second time in four years. \n“You just keep working. That’s all you can do. Can’t look back at what you should’ve done. You learn from your mistakes, but you can’t worry about what’s in the past,” Anderson said. “You’ve got to move forward, and we’re playing a good Robert E. Lee team that’s won some big games too and have some explosive playmakers. We’ve got to go out and play ball.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RZwHYa TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:37:13.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
