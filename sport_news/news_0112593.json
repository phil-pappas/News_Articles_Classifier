They stuck by me going into the offseason, through some tough times. \n\"This is the place I got drafted. This is the place that means a lot to me, and I still have a lot to prove and a lot that I want to do. I haven't been in the league very long, haven't made a very big impact, but I'm hopefully getting some chances this year before the season's over to try to get out and make something happen.\" \nManziel maintains that he will continue cooperating with league and team officials, but the off-the-field incident will not affect him as the Browns go through their preparations for Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals, which starts a three-game in 15-day stretch. \n\"Obviously, that's a situation that's ongoing with the league, something that I'm fully cooperating with,\" Manziel said. \"I'm fully answering anything, if they have to ask me in the future, but right now, it's ongoing and I'm going to leave it at that. \n\"If anybody reaches out to me, if the NFL does reach out to me, I'll fully cooperate with anything they ask me, anything that they need from me. I'm not shying away from that. I've cooperated fully with Avon. I've cooperated fully with everybody in the Browns and anybody that's asked me anything. It's an ongoing situation. I don't really want to speak on it much more than that, but if the situation does arise, I'll fully cooperate. That's really it. \n\"I find solace in that building. I find a sense of peace being around the guys that we have on this team, and I feel like the way that I'm treated in the building, the way that I'm treated when I'm there, I love it. I love the guys that we have on this team. When I'm in the building, when it's work time, I'm extremely excited to be in there, extremely excited to be going to work every day. I was able to stay prepared as I would any other week.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1S5JcS7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:37:29.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
