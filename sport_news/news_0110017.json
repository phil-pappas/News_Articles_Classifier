How about that? There you go. That's it. We're on to Indiana.\" \nBut first, an explanation. \"Rangers\" is the name of the punt-block team MSU put on the field to try to force a mistake. The 4 represents what MSU coaches told players all last week, that the mental aspect of the game would be four times more important than the physical aspects. \nAnd the 10 represents the 10 seconds on the clock when the final play began â€” after Dantonio had his players sit on the bus for 10 seconds to think about what needed to be done when the team arrived at Michigan Stadium on Saturday. \nAs for the Hoosiers (4-3, 0-3 Big Ten), they represent a big test for the still-shuffling secondary of the No. 7 Spartans (7-0, 3-0). Starting cornerback Darian Hicks is questionable after missing the Michigan game with a concussion, and Dantonio said true freshman cornerback Tyson Smith will be activated this week for the first time. \nHe said true freshman cornerback Josh Butler also could be activated. 18 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1LIF7C4 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:29:03.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
