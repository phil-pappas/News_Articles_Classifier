The state of the world body's finances for the period are unclear however. \nEnglish FA wants issues 'examined' \nFIFA's worst-ever crisis began in May when US prosecutors charged 14 football officials and sports business executives over involvement in more than US$150 million of bribes. \nWith the scandal steadily widening, uncertainty has mounted over FIFA's present and future leadership. \nBlatter, 79, insists he will stay on until February when a special election is called to choose his successor. \nPlatini had been the favourite to win that vote, but some believe his implication in the Swiss probe could harm his candidacy. \nMedia reports have said that FIFA's independent ethics committee is to open its own inquiry, which could lead to the suspension of both Blatter and Platini, the two most powerful men in world football. \nCash-strapped FIFA? \nIn an interview with AFP on Tuesday, Platini said he worked as special advisor to Blatter from 1998 — when Blatter took charge of FIFA — until 2002. \n“Mr Blatter informed me when I started my role as his advisor that it was not initially possible to pay the totality of my salary because of FIFA's financial situation at that time,” Platini said. \nAccording to a financial report published in April 2003 and available on FIFA's website, world football's governing body had a 115 million Swiss francs surplus at the close of the four-year cycle from 1999-2002. \nBut, in the same report, FIFA reported an expected loss of 134 million Swiss francs in May of 2002, when Platini finished his work as an advisor and joined FIFA's executive committee. \nThose losses were linked to a bankruptcy scandal that hit International Sports and Leisure (ISL), a Swiss media and marketing firm in partnership with FIFA through the late 1990s. \nFIFA earns significant revenue from the World Cup, and so the upturn in its financial fortunes after May 2002 was likely linked to income from the tournament. \nBetween witness and accused \nA source familiar with FIFA's finances at the time, but who requested anonymity, said the organisation had enough money to pay Platini. \n“The financial situation was strong enough to handle such a payment,” the source told AFP. \nIn the AFP interview, Platini said he is being targeted in “unfounded attacks,” which he expects will continue until FIFA's next president is chosen. \nThe English FA discussed the FIFA storm on Wednesday and released a statement giving new backing to Platini, with conditions however. \n“In July, The FA board decided unanimously to support Michel Platini if he intended to stand for the presidency of FIFA. We did so because we thought he was an excellent president of UEFA and could bring those same leadership qualities to FIFA. We are still of that view,” said a statement. \n“However, events of recent days have raised a number of issues which do need to be fully examined.” \nPlatini said on Monday he had been interviewed by Swiss authorities “not as a person accused of any wrongdoing, but simply in my capacity as a person providing information.” \nBut speaking to reporters, Lauber said: \"we didn't audition Mr. Platini as a witness. That is not true. We investigated against him in between a witness and an accused person.\" \nFIFA's ethics committee has said it typically launches inquiries against its officials once there is an “initial suspicion” — regardless of their rank. But it has so far remained silent on the case of Blatter and Platini. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:39:54.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
