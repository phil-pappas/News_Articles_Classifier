With winger Clarke MacArthur out for what's believed to be an extended period with a possible concussion, Cameron has moved veteran winger Milan Michalek to the left side to see if he can spark the duo.\nOne change that could be made at some point is moving winger Shane Prince up the depth chart. He was sixth in the AHL in goal-scoring last season and has been used in a fourth-line role since he got into the lineup. He had some success in the pre-season so that's a possibility if things don't change.\nFor now, the key is to get Ryan and Zibanejad going.\nRyan, the club's highest-paid player at $7.25 million this season, has only one goal and that came into an empty net against the Blue Jackets last Wednesday in Columbus while Zibanejad, 22, who has been a notoriously slow starter, scored his only goal of the season in the same game.\nRyan believes it's early and it's going to take time to build chemistry.\n\"We've seen through six games, we've had three different linemates, right? You don't have a whole lot of time to develop things,\" said Ryan. \"Even through training camp, Mika and I only skated together in one game. It wasn't consistent, it was a bit messy. So now we're having a week here where we can get some reps, get some flow, some 2-on-1's, 3-on-2's, and build from there.\n\"It's just reps (and) repetition. We know each other fairly well, you take (Hoffman) away, throw in a guy like (Michalek), they're very different. You have to find a way to create down low because that's the way (Michalek) and I like to play, and I think that's where our line is going to be good.\"\nGetting secondary scoring would take offensive pressure off Turris, Hoffman and Stone to carry the load. They didn't score in a 2-0 loss in Pittsburgh last week and the result was a shutout for the first time in 178 games. They can't be expected to be on the board every night.\nCameron said he liked the way Jean-Gabriel Pageau contributed with Alex Chiasson and Curtis Lazar Saturday. They didn't score but had chances but Cameron felt it was the club's best all-around effort of the season.\n\"I thought all four lines were real good. I thought our game was real good. The only thing that wasn't real good was the result,\" Cameron said. \"It's a four-line league. I think all the teams who have had success are able to play four lines so is it important for us to be able to rely on four lines? Absolutely.\"\nOne thing Cameron doesn't want to see is guys pressing to score.\n\"It's simple. You play to your level,\" he said. \"And you focus on how you play. Sometimes you score and sometimes you don't. Don't start chasing the game by cheating.\"\nThe sooner the scoring happens for other lines the better it will be for the Senators to have consistency in the win column.\nOtherwise, people will cast their ballots for Cameron to make changes to get the offence going.\nTwitter: @ sungarrioch\nSponsored\nGarrioch\nSens coach Dave Cameron not about to panic about lack of production\nBy Bruce Garrioch , Ottawa Sun First posted: Monday, October 19, 2015 04:50 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 19, 2015 05:10 PM EDT\nOn election day, Dave Cameron elected not to change his lines.\nHe wants to give this group of Senators some time to get their act together.\nYes, the Senators' coach would like to see more production up front from more than the trio of Kyle Turris, Mark Stone and Mike Hoffman but as the Senators took the ice at the Canadian International Hockey Academy in Rockland Monday, Cameron opted not to make any changes.\nAbout the author Bruce Garrioch Bruce Garrioch's Blog Follow Bruce Garrioch on Twitter Other Stories Hammond back down to Earth\nEven The Hamburglar has found out he's only human.
