In the end, however, the Cougars rode individual champion Mitch Jancse’s 76 and solid performances from the bottom of the lineup for a six-stroke victory, 324-330. The reason many thought the Falcons would dethrone Kettle Run was the play of Ty Foster and Frankie Strano. Foster, Fauquier’s No. 2 golfer, made the turn at Fauquier Springs’ hole No. 9 with a one-over 35. Strano, the team’s top golfer, found himself just two strokes over par. The Cougars, meanwhile, lost Patrick Turnure to a shoulder injury, causing a withdrawal from the five-team tourney, and the remaining three teammates struggled. Once the leaders started arriving back at the clubhouse it became apparent the two teams had a reversal of fortune. The biggest difference came in Foster’s score, which swelled to a 52 on the back 9. “I don’t know why,” Foster said. “Golf is golf. A lack of mental focus. I lost a ball off the tee at 12 and another at 18. The whole 9 was that way.” His coach, Bob Martin, said he was pleased with his team’s performance after watching it struggle the past couple weeks, but felt Foster should have done better. “We had one under 80, one close to 80 and another in the mid-80s,” Martin said. “And then we had Ty.” Cougars' coach Dale Edwards understands his rival coach. “It’s been an up-and-down year,” Edwards said. “And it didn’t look good when my team finished nine. But they rebounded on the swaps.” With Turnure out, Edwards counted on the rest of the team to pick up the slack. “We’ve had different kids in the top four all year,” Edwards said. “Today, [Hunter] Anderson and [Garrett] Moore came in with good scores to go along with Mitch and Austin Finan.” Jancse credited help from Edwards to fix a bad swing and better chipping around the greens for his total. “I had a nasty draw on drives last week and coach Dale helped me on that,” Jancse said. His best chip of the match came on 16 after he overshot the green. Facing an upslope lie in the short rough 38-yards from the pin, Jancse solidly hit the ball with a wedge. He watched the ball hit the fringe and bounce several times before rolling into the cup for a birdie. On 17, he was lying in the fairway valley about 50 yards from the pin. Holding a hybrid-60-degree wedge in his hands Jancse went back to his bag for a different club. “I didn’t want to overshoot the green again,” Jancse said. “You never want to be on the backside of a green at Fauquier Springs. I got a 52 out and hit the shot I wanted.” The ball landed on the green, stopping above the hole. He putted it in for another birdie. His approach on 18 landed pin-high about 25 feet away from the pin and again Jancse had success. Both Fauquier and Kettle Run will represent the conference at next Monday’s 4A West regional at Harrisonburg’s Heritage Oaks Golf Course. Joining Jancse and Strano atop the leader board were Freedom (South Riding’s) Ashley Nguyen (78) and four golfers who carded 82. The tie required a one-hole playoff with Kettle Run's Austin Finan birdieing hole No. 1 to finish fourth overall. Liberty-Bealeton’s Rusty Markley parred the hole to take fifth, and Fauquier’s Jack Avernce bogeyed to win the sixth-place medal. Cougar Garrett Moore scored a 7, finishing out of the awards. Joining the two Fauquier County teams at regionals will be the next seven individuals to finish with lowest scores. Included in the mix are Nguyen, her teammates Hunter Capestany (87), Ryan Scanlon (87) and Joe Skinner and Sejal Sankaran, who both shot 91s. John Champe’s Matthew Chang (87) and Kenny Pereira (88) will also play in the regional. Conference 22 golf tournament 1.
