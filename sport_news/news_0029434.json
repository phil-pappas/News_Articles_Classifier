He said there was an urgent need for comprehensive reform in the system and lamented that the Supreme Court did not approve the NJAC, which was a step in that direction.\n\"The nation has witnessed many unpleasant events connected with judicial appointments -- events which lend credence to the speculation that the system established by the Second and Third Judges cases in its operational reality is perhaps not the best system for securing an independent and efficient judiciary,\" he said.\nTerming the collegium system as non-transparent, he said the correspondence between the government and the CJI and the record of the consultation process were some of the best guarded secrets of the country.\n\"Transparency is an aspect of rationality. The need for transparency is more in the case of appointment process. Proceedings of the collegium were absolutely opaque and inaccessible both to public and history, barring occasional leaks,\" he said.\n\"The records are absolutely beyond the reach of any person including the judges of this court who are not lucky enough to become CJI. Such a state of affairs does not either enhance the credibility of the institution nor is good for the people of this country,\" Justice Chelameswar said.\nThe judge said the judiciary could not claim to be the sole protector of peoples' right and referred to instances where the SC had failed to live up to citizens' expectation in preserving their liberties. He said, \"In difficult times, when political branches cannot be counted upon, neither can the judiciary.\nTo assume or assert that judiciary alone is concerned with the preservation of liberties and does that job well is an assumption that is dogmatic, bereft of evidentiary basis and historically disproved. To wholly eliminate the executive from the process of selection would be inconsistent with the foundational premise that government in a democracy is by chosen representatives of the people.\"\nHe said the fiasco created by the collegium in appointment of Justice P D Dinakaran and appointment of a judge in Madras HC were part of judicial records but there were many other cases when undeserving people were appointed judges.\n\"A few more instances were mentioned at the bar during the course of hearing to demonstrate not only the shallowness of the theory but also the recommendations by the collegium have not necessarily always been in the best interests of the institution and the nation. It is not really necessary to place on record all the details but it is sufficient to mention that the earlier mentioned two cases are not certainly the only examples of the inappropriate exercise of the power of the collegium,\" he said.\n\"I only part with this case recollecting the words of Macaulay - reform that you may preserve. Future alone can tell whether I am rightly reminded of those words or not,\" he said.
