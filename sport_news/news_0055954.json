AFP PHOTO / THOMAS SAMSON (Photo credit should read THOMAS SAMSON/AFP/Getty Images) Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid ground out an entertaining 0-0 draw on Wednesday night in France in a match that presented its chances -- but also displayed curiously little appetite for risk. In the end, the home side were revealed as being short of ideas on the night, but the football on display was of the highest caliber.\nAdChoices The result left both teams atop Group A on seven points, separated only by goal difference, and that a quite slight one. Malmo now trail by a full four points after other results today, and Shakhtar remain very much dead last.\nIn the grand scheme of things, this was not expected to be a make or break match. In fact, both PSG and Real Madrid should easily advance out of Group A, with Malmo and Shakhtar left to fight for that unwanted Europa League slot. Yet this remained thrilling matchup on paper despite some high profile absentees – Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale were but a few of the players unavailable.\nReal, unquestionably the more depleted of the two sides, looked anything but threadbare. Crisp in the back and very dangerous on the counter, their 4-4-2 forced Laurent Blanc to play it safe. Blaise Matuidi, hamstrung by collecting an early and foolish card, was unable to get into the attack and connect with Serge Aurier’s runs out of the back, often leaving Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a lonely target man in the box.\nReal also had the better of the chances in the early going, with Jese looking particularly dangerous, and getting off the first real shot of the game after only 3 minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo was the provider, pouncing on a loose ball from Thiago Motta to force Kevin Trapp into a sliding stop.\nJese would force another great stop in the 28 th minute when Toni Kroos slipped in a lovely disguised pass that was in turn blasted to the far corner from 15 yards. But Trapp again got down well and booted the shot clear to save what should have been the game’s first goal.\nRonaldo would have several chances of his own, heading a cross from Marcelo to Trapp’s far post that the keeper was forced to turn around and out; then launching a fine point-blank header off the ensuing corner kick that Trapp did well to palm over.\nAt the other end, chances were sparse. Matuidi had a ball fall kindly to him in the 18 th , but the shot was tame and routine in the end for Keylor Navas. Aurier and Angel Di Maria were given space by Marcelo bombing forward, but there was a lack of technique when it came to the final ball. Too often, good work from the likes of Aurier and Maxwell went to waste.\nStill, both sides went into the lockers deadlocked at the half, and while Rafa Benitez was probably the happier of the two managers, it looked as if it would take something special to separate the sides.\nEdinson Cavani looked as if he might provide that spark. Anonymous for much of the game he nonetheless popped up in the 47 th , beating Varane to a cross from Motta – only to see his shot go agonizingly wide.\nCavani would continue to find himself in positive areas and nearly struck again in the 56 th only to see it smartly stopped. Ibrahimovic then had a fine chance on a header as Maxwell’s cross beat Sergio Ramos but the whistle went for a push – and the header was also high.\nDespite PSG’s endeavor, the best chances continued to fall for Ronaldo. A gorgeous attempt that on any other day would have billowed the back of the net was instead somehow missed in the 71 st , Ronaldo stroking a fine left-footed shot past Trapp – and past the far post to boot. It was an uncharacteristic flub, and his reaction told the story – he knew he should have scored.\nAnd with that, the game noticeably dropped in pace and tension. Real Madrid simply throttled the match and PSG were left chasing long balls and hopeful passes. It was not until stoppage time and a very late chance fell to Ibrahimovic – a free header he put nowhere near the frame – that the Frenchmen looked as if they wanted a winner. They did not get it.\nBoth sides will get a chance for a do-over: Real Madrid will next host PSG on MatchDay Four coming up immediately on November 4.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:40:53.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
