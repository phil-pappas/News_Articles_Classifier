He broke his foot in the opener against the Giants, a 27-26 Dallas victory. The rematch Sunday will be six weeks since Bryant's injury. \nA team spokesman said Bryant could travel Saturday. The team left a day earlier than usual to visit the 9/11 memorial. \nBryant did conditioning work on the side in practice after making his first appearance during the bye last week. \nThe Cowboys are 0-3 without Bryant and Tony Romo, who broke his left collarbone a week after Bryant went down and will miss at least four more games. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:12:48.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
