But at the same time, football takes a toll. We have guys that are out, they have guys that are out,\" Brady said.\" Obviously they have some of their very best, best players out, which is a bummer.\"\nThe Cowboys may be off to a 2-2 start, but Brady isn't doesn't believe their .500 record is indicative of how talented they are.\n“They went to New Orleans last night, I know it was a tough loss,\" Brady said. \"They’ve had two tough losses. I think they’re a very good football team, especially on defense. We’ve got our work cut out for us.\"\nBrady spent his bye week getting a head start on Dallas' film, and hasn't forgotten that the Cowboys gave the Packers all they could handle in Green Bay's controversial 26-21 win in last season's divisional round.\n\"I’ve been studying them a lot the last three or four days,\" Brady said. \"They went up to Green Bay last year at the end of the year and almost beat them for an opportunity to advance to the NFC championship game. It’s a good football team. We’ve got our work cut out for us, no question.”\nComing out of the bye, Brady believes where the undefeated Patriots' season goes from here is in the players' hands.\n“It’s up to us to determine the fate of our season,\" he said. \"It's going to take a lot of work, a lot of practice. We’re going to see what we’re made of.”\nWEEI hosts Dennis and Callahan shifted gears a bit, and asked the quarterback about the changing landscape of youth sports. Brady, a father of three, had an interesting perspective, and said he hopes his children are late bloomers.\n“What I remember from being in youth sports, everything was really localized. There was no travel teams,\" he said. \"Well, there was a couple, but you really had to be the top, top kid to go on those teams. My parents always exposed us to different things, different sports. It was basketball when it was basketball season, it was baseball when it was baseball season. I didn’t play football ’til I was a freshman in high school. A lot of soccer. And there were just some (football) camps. But I just played in the neighborhood in our street with all the kids that we grew up with.\n“It’s just different now, experiencing it with my own kids. All the organized activities that you put them in. I made a comment for a while now, I hope my kids are late bloomers in whatever they do because they’re going to be exposed to so much at such an early time that, yeah, you do worry about what their motivation may be as they get older or if they feel like they’ve been in something for so long and it’s been hyper-intense and hyper-focused for so long, I think that can wear out a young individual, a young teenager. It’s just hard, because all the parents are doing it, it seems. The competition, it feels like it starts so early for these kids, whether it’s to get into college, or to get into the right high school, or the right elementary school.\"\nBrady also admitted that there's one thing that longtime rival Peyton Manning may be better at: hosting Saturday Night Live.\nThe ten-year anniversary of Brady hosting SNL is coming up, and when asked who was a better host, Brady said, “I’d take Peyton in that one.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:38:56.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
