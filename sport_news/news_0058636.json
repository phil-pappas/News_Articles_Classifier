Twitter Adam Burns reports FINAL: Jefferson City defeats Rock Bridge, 31-14. The Jays will face Blue Springs South in the district semifinals next week. #mopreps — Adam Burns (@AdamBurnsJC) October 24, 2015 \nAll of the Jefferson City points were scored in the first half, and Rock Bridge scored a touchdown in the second and once in the third to come up short. \n“It was a great first half,” Jefferson City head coach Ted LePage said. “We executed in the first half, and then in the second half we tried to hang on for dear life. They became a desperate football team in the second half.” \nJefferson City (9-1) moves on to the district semifinals to face second-seeded Blue Springs South (10-0) Friday in Blue Springs. Blue Springs South dominated on its way to a 56-0 win against Troy-Buchanan. \nThe Jays had a slight advantage in total yardage with 267 compared to the Bruins’ 253. \nAfter winning the toss and deferring to the second half, the Jays ‘defense forced the Bruins offense to a three-and-out. Jefferson City took advantage of starting at Rock Bridge’s 42 on its way to a five-play, 58-yard scoring drive, capped off by a 3-yard Denzel Wilson rushing touchdown. \nThe Jays and Bruins traded sets of punts, as both teams struggled to get much going offensively. Wilson ran for just 18 yards on seven carries in the first half. \nBruins’ quarterback Trevor Twehous tossed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Hayden Johnson to tie it at 7 with 9:53 left in the second quarter. Twehous, who was playing for the injured Karson Ringdahl, orchestrated a momentum-building seven-play, 80-yard drive. \nThat momentum was short-lived. \nJefferson City junior Dennis Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown to reclaim the lead. \nIt was a lead the home side wouldn’t give up. \nFollowing a Bruins punt, Jays’ junior quarterback Gunnar See found senior wide receiver Daniel Ellinger down the left sideline for a 43-yard touchdown. Ellinger was tightly guarded, but he never gave up on the ball as the Bruin defender failed to swat it away. \nLater in the second quarter, junior tight end Allan Roettgen was left wide open as See led the offense on a play action to his right, and found Roettgen for an easy 11-yard strike to take a 28-7 lead with just 1:11 left in the half.

With the seconds ticking down before half, Strobel raced 60 yards to set up a 32-yard J.T. Bohlken field goal as time expired. \nThat would be the Jays’ final score of the game, as they came out in the second half looking to run the ball to waste clock. \n“We were really trying to not take too many chances,” LePage said, “because they’re very explosive and very good on defense. We were trying to minimize our mistakes and run the clock in the second half.” \nRunning back Nick Collins raced for a 65-yard touchdown with 7:23 to play in the third quarter for the Bruins’ final score of the contest. He ended with 107 yards on six carries after being limited to 19 yards in the first half. \nRock Bridge ends the season at 2-8. \nFollow News Tribune sports reporter Adam Burns (@AdamBurnsJC) on Twitter for updates during games.
