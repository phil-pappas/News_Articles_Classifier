The transfer pricing case dates back to FY2007-2008 pertaining to sale of one of its call centres in Ahmedabad.\nTransfer pricing involves related entities dealing at arm's length to ensure fair pricing of the asset that is transferred.\nThe IT Appellate Tribunal, on December 10 last year, had held that the company had structured the deal with another India-based entity Hutchison Whampoa Properties with the intention to circumvent the transfer pricing norms even though it was an international transaction wherein there was no arm's length dealing between the two related entities.\nVodafone pleaded in the High Court that IT department had no jurisdiction in the transfer pricing case because the said transaction was not international and did not attract tax.\nThe dispute relates to the sale of the Ahmedabad-based call centre business (Vodafone India Services formerly known as 3 Global Services) for assessment year 2008-09. The department had slapped a tax demand on the company on October 31, 2012 under sections 143(3) and 144C(13) of Income Tax Act.\nThe transfer pricing dispute arose after the income tax department issued draft transfer pricing order in December 2011 and added Rs 8,500 crore to Vodafone's taxable income for sale of its call centre business in 2007.\nIn 2013, the Income Tax department had issued a tax demand of Rs 3,700 crore to Vodafone India. However, after the company challenged the demand notice, the tribunal had stayed the demand during the pendency of the plea and directed Vodafone to deposit Rs 200 crore by February 15, 2014, which it had done.\nVodafone had argued before the IT Appellate Tribunal also that the Supreme Court order of February 2011 had upheld the company's position that there being no assignment of call options there were no question of taxable income. It also argued that the sale of call centre business was between two domestic companies and that the transfer pricing officer had no jurisdiction over the deal.\nVodafone India Services was originally incorporated in March 1999 in the name of 3 Global Services as a wholly-owned arm of Hutchison Teleservices India Holdings, a company incorporated in Mauritius. Hutchison Teleservices, in turn, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGP Investments Holdings, incorporated in the Cayman Islands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:32:52.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
