Beltre appeared to be wiping away tears as he was helped off the field and into the dugout. He was replaced by Hanser Alberto. \nBeltre hit .287 with 18 homers and 87 RBIs this season. His two-out single in the third gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead over David Price and the Blue Jays. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:44:55.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
