He said there is no specific prognosis yet but that at the most Wagner could maybe be out “a couple of weeks if it doesn’t respond. But he might be able to play this week so we’ll wait and see.’’ Brock Coyle replaced Wagner for the two plays he missed after being injured in the fourth quarter before returning to play the rest of the game. —Carroll said DT Jordan Hill might be sidelined “a couple of weeks’’ with a strained quad. He said the hope is that Demarcus Dobbs will make it back this week after missing the last two games with a shoulder injury. But Carroll noted that if Dobbs does not make it back the team is getting pretty thin up front. “We have a few options but we don’t like getting much thinner than this,’’ Carroll said. “It’s pretty thin if he (Dobbs) can’t go again.’’ — Carroll said RB Marshawn Lynch should be back to practice Thursday and able to play Sunday against Carolina. Carroll said Lynch had a good day running on Monday and appears on track to returning this week. — Carroll said RB Fred Jackson, who played despite suffering a high ankle sprain the previous week, made it through the game fine. — Carroll confirmed that CB Tharold Simon will have surgery to repair an issue with a toe. He was placed on season-ending Injured Reserve on Saturday to make room for running back Rod Smith on the roster. \nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
