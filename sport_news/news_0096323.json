Each are worth one point. This is four fewer team matches than previous years. \nLast time: The Americans didn't lose a session until it no longer mattered. They built a 14-8 lead in four sessions of team play, and wound up with an 18 1/2-15 1/2 victory in 2013 at Muirfield Village to extend their unbeaten streak to seven Presidents Cups. Tiger Woods , who went 4-1, delivered the winning point for the second straight time. \nU.S. team: Rickie Fowler , Jim Furyk , Bill Haas , Dustin Johnson , Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk , Matt Kuchar , Phil Mickelson , Patrick Reed , Jordan Spieth , Jimmy Walker , Bubba Watson . \nTale of the tape: The Americans have six of the top 10 players in the world and all 12 players are among the top 28 in the world ranking. The International has only one player in the top 10, and six players are outside the top 30. \nKey Statistic: The last time the Americans lost the Presidents Cup, nine players on this U.S. team were still amateurs. Spieth was in kindergarten. \nNotable: The International team has never had players from more than two Asian countries. For the first Presidents Cup staged in Asia, the team has players from four countries - South Korea (Sang-moon Bae), Japan (Hideki Matsuyama), Thailand (Thongchai Jaidee) and India (Anirban Lahiri). \nQuotable: ''You don't want it to turn into an exhibition match.'' - Jason Day, on the American dominance of the Presidents Cup. \nLive Television (all times EDT): Wednesday, 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., Golf Channel.
