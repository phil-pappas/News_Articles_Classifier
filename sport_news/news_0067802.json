Given the makeshift offensive line, and latest set of injuries to center-turned-left tackle Jack Allen and tailback Madre London, this was a helluva output — especially from Cook and his receivers. It wasn't just the totals, it was the big-time throws and catches at critical times, evidenced by converting 11 of 17 third downs and a fourth-and-10 in the game's first scoring drive. However, none of those clutch plays were more essential to keeping the Spartans undefeated than Cook to R.J. Shelton for 29 yards on third-and-9 on MSU's game-winning,go-ahead drive. \nDEFENSE: 6 \nMSU couldn't defend Rutgers wide receiver Leonte Carroo, who caught seven passes for 134 yards and scored all three of the Scarlet Knights' touchdowns in his return from suspension. Trae Waynes kept him in check last year in East Lansing. Carroo will join Waynes playing on Sundays next year and Rutgers is a completely different team with him. MSU's defense gave up a 72-yard run to Paul James and struggled to bring down tailback Robert Martin. But at the end of the game, when a play was needed, the Spartans again made it — Arjen Colquhoun breaking up a would-be touchdown pass to Carroo, which forced Rutgers to settle for a game-tying field goal, before MSU's final drive. Count it: MSU 31, Rutgers 24 \nSPECIAL TEAMS: 3 \nThese units are becoming an issue for the Spartans, who continue to survive despite them. Taybor Pepper bounced a punt snap to Jake Hartbarger, who handled it like an outfielder trying to play first base. Michael Geiger had a field goal blocked and needed help from the post on another try, both from 35 yards or less — though the block appeared to be the result of an opening in the offensive line. And Geiger, filling in for Kevin Cronin on kickoffs, booted the ball out of bounds before Rutgers' final drive, giving the Scarlet Knights the ball at the 35-yard line. At some point, these sort of mishaps will be costly. \nCOACHING: 9 \nMSU functioned Saturday night with an offensive line and defensive secondary it never imagined in August. And it survived, with young players hanging in there enough to let the Spartans' stars win the game. This team is struggling in several ways. But it is not mentally weak. That's a culture. It begins with coaching. MSU's game plan leaned on the players it could count on most — Connor Cook, Aaron Burbridge, LJ Scott, etc. And others made plays when called upon — Paul Lang, DeAnthony Arnett. At some point, this battered group may finally fall. It won't be for a lack of mettle. \nBOTTOM LINE: 7 \nNext up for MSU is a game that's growing with anticipation each week as Michigan drubs one opponent after another. Meanwhile, the Spartans are getting by, barely, with clear vulnerabilities and serious injuries. All the momentum and fun these days is on the Wolverines' side. Dantonio's six wins in seven seasons against Michigan seems to be somehow forgotten. It won't be if he can manage No. ... 7.
