(WKYT) - The Kentucky Wildcats will look to run their record to 3-1 Saturday night as the EKU Colonels come into Commonwealth Stadium. Mark Stoops is pleased with the way his team has prepared coming off three straight SEC games. \n\"It’s been a good week,” Stoops said. “We cap it off tomorrow with our last little run-through. Just looking forward to getting back on the field Saturday and looking to improve on what we’ve been doing.” \nStoops said he did talk with EKU coach Dean Hood. Stoops offered his sympathies after the tragic death of Eastern defensive lineman Joey Kraemer and he told Hood he wouldn't tolerate any “extracurricular stuff” stemming from a January incident involving UK and EKU players. \n“We had a good conversation,” Stoops said. “As I said on Monday, I have great respect for him and their program and what they’ve done. We’re looking forward to welcoming them to our stadium and playing a good, clean, hard-fought game.” \nDefensive tackle Regie Meant will remain sidelined with a shoulder injury. Stoops said he does not believe the injury will linger. Offensive tackle Jordan Swindle and wide receiver Dorian Baker will play. Stoops did not comment on whether running back Boom Williams will see action. Williams missed practice early in the week dealing with a \"personal issue,\" but returned Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:02:15.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
