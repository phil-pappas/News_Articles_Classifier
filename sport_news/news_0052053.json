Filed: Thursday, October 8, 2015 at 05:01 UK Last Updated: Thursday, October 8, 2015 at 05:02 UK \nThe Vancouver Whitecaps have clinched a playoff spot by playing out a goalless draw with Dallas at BC Place. \nBoth sides often struggled to make progress in a cagey first half, but it could have been a very different story had Jesse Gonzalez not managed to get a strong hand to Octavio Rivero 's powerful header. \nIt was Vancouver who looked the more dangerous for long spells and the lively Rivero was a constant threat to the visiting defence as he clipped the top of the crossbar with his second header of the night. \nDallas improved as the game progressed, but they missed a great opportunity to break the deadlock when a patient passing move ended with Ryan Hollingshead 's effort being tipped past the post by David Ousted . \nVancouver were on top once again after the break, with Kekuta Manneh forcing Gonzalez into a comfortable save with a powerful strike from the edge of the box. \nMuch like the first half, Dallas would grow in confidence once again to control possession for long spells before creating a chance Mauro Diaz 's header found Tesho Akindele , whose weak effort was kept out by Ousted. \nThe Vancouver goalkeeper came to the rescue again when David Texeira tested him with a low effort after turning two defenders to create space. \nThere would be no late twist, though, as Dallas moved level on points with Western Conference leaders the Los Angeles Galaxy, one point ahead of the Whitecaps.
