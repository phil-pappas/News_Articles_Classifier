(Stephen D. Cannerelli) Comments \nSecond-year defenseman Slater Koekkoek practiced with the Syracuse Crunch on Friday and then packed his gear for a trip to Tampa Bay. \nKoekkoek will help fill a hole created on Thursday night when Victor Hedman was injured in a game against Dallas. Also, blueliner Nikita Nesterov was tossed from that contest after a questionable hit and might face an NHL suspension. \nKoekkoek, a first-round pick by the Lightning in 2012, was among the final groups of cuts from Tampa Bay to Syracuse this preseason. \n\"I'm excited and just hope I can do everything to get Tampa back winning and see what I can do,'' Koekkoek said Friday afternoon. \"You kind of get looking at positions and you that they've got a lot of great d-men there, older d-men. So I knew I was going to start in Syracuse and am thankful for the chance this early.'' \nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:55:47.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
