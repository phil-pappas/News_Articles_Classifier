Scott Ericson: Trinity-Norwalk fiasco a black eye for everyone 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nWhen the Trinity Catholic football team traveled to Norwalk High last Friday it was billed as a marquee game in the FCIAC between two teams with high hopes for the season. \nBy the time the game ended around 10 p.m. the last thing anyone was talking about was a high school football game between two solid programs. \nInstead everyone on social media that night and carrying over into the next day at the Greenwich-Darien football game was talking about referees, unruly crowds and one of the biggest black eyes for the league in quite some time. \nCoaches were ejected, a referee and a coach nearly came to blows, fans threw debris on the field and then chased the officials out of the stadium as police kept them at bay. \nIt should not have been this way. \nWe should have been discussing Norwalk’s big fumble recovery that set up its go-ahead score or the impressive 68-yard drive by Trinity with time winding down that ultimately won the game for the Crusaders. \nInstead, the game became an afterthought and anything the players may have accomplished on the field was lost. \nLet me start by saying there is nobody who stands up for high school officials as much as I do. \nThese men and women are out there officiating high school games because they love the sport and want to still be a part of it in some way. \nThey are dedicated, honest and truly want the best thing for the games and athletes. \nI often talk fans and coaches down from the “they screwed us” complaint, telling them that while the calls may not have been to your liking, the official in question was in no way aligning with the opposition. \nHaving said all of that, the officiating crew at Norwalk High Friday had a bad night. \nA really bad night. \nYou can live with calls going one way or another as sometimes they are right and sometimes they are wrong, but the mess Friday night was not about specific calls. \nThere were 25 penalties called in the game and nearly everyone was followed by a lengthy discussion between the crew which killed any flow to the game, agitating both benches and fan bases. \nYou don’t mind referees getting together to get calls right, but when you have a simple procedure penalty on the offense it should not be followed by a two-minute huddle of officials. \nThe crew also assessed the wrong yardage several times on penalties, including putting Trinity at the 1-yard line rather than the 5-yard line after a Norwalk penalty. Trinity scored from the 1. \nI said at the time it was the worst officiated game I have ever covered and I stick by that, it was a debacle. \nThe mess culminated in the final controversial play with 1:33 left when Trinity’s Johnny Somers caught a pass for the go-ahead touchdown on fourth down. \nThe official on the sideline began to raise his arms indicating a touchdown, but quickly waived it off as incomplete when Somers dropped the ball on the track after running out of the end zone. \nFrom my angle at the back of the end zone it looked like a catch, but I could not see if the ball was being bobbled. The official standing in front of me surely saw what I did and ran across the field to initiate another lengthy discussion. \nAfter a few minutes the call was overturned and the play was ruled a touchdown, putting Trinity up 22-20 and sending the Norwalk bench into a tornado of anger with coach Sean Ireland being ejected for unsportsmanlike conduct. \nWhether the initial call was right or wrong the official from the back of the end zone never should have overturned it, and that was the source of Ireland’s anger. \nThis was a huge game for his program and Ireland felt he had been cheated. His anger was pretty justifiable given how the game was going. \nHowever, what happened next was in no way justifiable. \nAfter a Trinity interception sealed the game, an official had to be restrained by Norwalk athletic director Doug Marchetti and a police officer from physically going after a coach on the Norwalk sideline. \nThis altercation drove the already riled up crowd over the edge and a plastic bottle was thrown from the bleachers on the field near the officials. \nWhile I understand the anger of the Norwalk fans, throwing objects on the field is a big no-no but not as big as what happened after the game. \nAs the crew made their way off the field a crush of Norwalk fans, mostly students, raced toward the exiting officials who had two Norwalk police officers and a few Norwalk staff members trailing them. \nThe police swinging closed the iron gate at the entrance to Testa Field so the officials could get to their cars was the only thing that prevented a major incident from happening. \nIt was a bad look for Norwalk and a horrible night for the FCIAC. \nMarchetti told John Nash of the Norwalk Hour: “This is a tough week. What happened was an embarrassment. I know from a game administration standpoint, I have to make some changes, be it with crowd control or a larger police presence.” \nNorwalk Public school communication chief Brenda Wilcox Williams issued this statement. \n“School and district administrators (Monday) reviewed reports of the events that followed the end of Friday night’s football game at Norwalk High,” the statement read. “We know competitive events like this can bring a lot of excitement and emotion. Nonetheless, we expect both students and adults to always behave with respect for everyone, no matter what the score and end result. Norwalk High administrators will reinforce those expectations with students, parents and staff. \nPer CIAC rules, Ireland will be suspended for the team’s game this week against Ridgefield and no further punishments are planned. \nAn increased security presence should be expected going forward at Norwalk High. \nI get the fans anger, I do, and since they were mostly high school kids I can almost forgive them. \nI mean if I was in that crowd as a 17-year old I would have been just as mad and probably would have been leading the charge to go yell at the exiting officials. \nNo longer being 17, I know that sort of behavior, while it has been increasing at athletic events across the country, is wholly unacceptable. \nThere have been several incidents of youth sports officials being assaulted and even killed by angry fans and while that did not happen at Norwalk Friday it easily could have. \nHad the police not hustled the officials out and closed that gate, there is no telling what we would be talking about today, but it likely would have been much worse. \nOur kids need to be taught that abusing an official is not a right as a fan and physically going after an official is not only wrong, it is criminal and cannot happen again because next time there may not be a gate. \nScott.Ericson@scni.com; @EricsonSports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:40:53.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
