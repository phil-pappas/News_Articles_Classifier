PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Jose Fernandez had to wait more than two years for a second chance to show his big league stuff near his first adopted American home.\nThe Marlins' ace erased some of the sour residue from his previous visit to Tropicana Field, but he'll wait a while longer for a more satisfying result after being outdueled by Jake Odorizzi in a 4-1 Rays victory Thursday.\nFernandez said he remembered everything about the beating he took when he pitched at the Trop as a rookie on May 27, 2013. The seven runs (four earned) he allowed that day, in 31/3 innings, were the most he's given up in one game.\nFernandez completed six innings this time while giving up two runs and a career-high 11 hits. That topped the nine he allowed in his latest outing when he got his record-breaking 17th win to begin his career at Marlins Park despite being nicked for six runs by the Braves.\nFernandez won two state championships at Tampa Alonso High after fleeing his native Cuba and settling in the bay area. He was unable to transfer any of the Miami mystique to the opposite coast.\nNor for that matter to anywhere away from Marlins Park, where he is 17-0. His career record on the road dropped to 5-9, though he lowered his ERA slightly to 3.78.\nThe Rays had multiple hits in four consecutive innings against Fernandez, who didn't retire the side in order until his final inning, the sixth.\nFernandez (6-1) threw 10 of 11 pitches for strikes that inning, fanning the final two hitters he faced on three pitches each. He ended with nine strikeouts and no walks while throwing 71 of 96 pitches for strikes.\nNot a bad outing for Fernandez to take into the offseason, but it couldn't prevent a three-game series sweep by the Rays, who won five of six from the Marlins this season.\nMiami finished 0-10 on the road against American League opponents. They have lost 12 straight in AL parks since beating the Angels on Aug. 25, 2014 in Anaheim.\nOdorizzi grabbed the spotlight and commanded the night, holding the Marlins to one unearned run and four hits in seven innings.\nThe Marlins didn't get a hit off him until Marcell Ozuna led off the fifth by slicing a single to right. Ozuna scored on a sacrifice fly by Ichiro Suzuki. The run was unearned due to a throwing error by catcher J.P. Arencibia.\nThe Marlins had a chance to tie it before Fernandez left the game when Ichiro Suzuki slashed a two-out single to center in the sixth. But Kevin Kiermaier threw a strike to the plate to nail J.T. Realmuto attempting to score from second.\nThe hit was the 2,935th of Ichiro's career, tying him with Barry Bonds for 35th on the all-time list.\nFernandez didn't get off to the start he wanted when he gave up a two-out homer to Evan Longoria in the first. He fell behind 2-0, and the veteran Longoria jumped on the belt-high, 97-mph fastball.\nA two-out double in the second put runners on second and third. But Fernandez came back to strike out Nick Franklin on a sharp curve.\nThe Rays chipped away with four singles in the third, none of them hit hard but each just out of reach of a fielder. Grady Sizemore put the Rays ahead 2-0 with his fourth RBI in two nights. Fernandez got out of further trouble by inducing James Loney to hit a made-to-order double-play bouncer to Dee Gordon at second.\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1731334&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1731334", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1731334&h=Odorizzi+outpitches+Fernandez+as+Rays+beat+Marlins%2C+4%2D1"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:58:39.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
