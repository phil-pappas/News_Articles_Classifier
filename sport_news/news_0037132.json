Although, Chelsea Football Club officially made a statement backing its manager, despite the club having its worst start to the season in the last 37 years, when the club picked up just 5 points from the opening 8 games during 1978-1979 season and finally finished at the bottom of the table in Division One. \nChelsea and Aston Villa both have had a bad start to the season. While Chelsea have won 2 matches, Aston Villa have 1 win registered in their name. Chelsea is currently sitting at the 16th position of the BPL Table while Aston Villa is at 18th with 4 points separating both the teams. Last time Aston Villa faced Chelsea at the Stamford Bridge, Chelsea won the match 3-0 with Oscar (7’), Costa (59’) and Willian (79’) scoring for The Blues. \nKey Points \nVilla has not kept a league clean sheet at Stamford Bridge since March 1998 and has conceded 30 times in their last eight matches at the ground. \nChelsea average just under four goals a game against Aston Villa over their last eight Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge. \nChelsea has scored in 23 consecutive home league matches, the longest current run in the Premier League. \nWillian’s goal in last match against Southampton was his fourth and the team’s fifth from a direct free-kick this season, which is already three more than what Chelsea achieved in 2014/15. \nIf selected Oscar will play his 100th Premier League appearance for the Blues. \nJohn Terry is one match away from his 465th league appearance for Chelsea. \nEden Hazard requires one goal for a half century of goals for the Blues. He will become Chelsea’s eighth overseas player to reach that milestone. \nJose Mourinho is seeking his 200th win over his two spells as Chelsea manager. Villa will be his 309th match. \nAston Villa’s four points from their first eight games is their equal worst start (with 1986/87) to a top-flight season. \nTim Sherwood’s side have scored in their last nine away league games, the longest current run in the top flight. \nJose Mourinho has never lost successive home games in his career. \nAston Villa has won just 1 of their last 4 away games and losing the other 3. \nTeam News \nChelsea: \nChelsea need solve their defensive problems as soon as possible as they have already conceded 17 goals, which is just a goal behind Sunderland (18). \nDiego Costa is back from suspension and now available for selection. Remy and Falcao failed to make up for Costa’s absence which eventually hurt The Blues. \nBranislav Ivanovic, having his worst start to the season, was injured during the international break and Jose would be forced to sideline him. With Baba Rahman yet to gain exposure in the League it is most likely that Zouma would start in Ivanovic’s place. \nRuben Loftus-Cheek could also feature in the game as Jose had said earlier that he might give the lad a chance. \nExpected 11: Begovic; Zouma, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta; Fabregas, Ruben Loftus-Cheek; Willian, Oscar, Hazard; Costa \nAston Villa: \nNothing seems to be going right for Aston Villa this season. They come into this game losing 5 and drawing 1 out of their last 6 games. Aston Villa manager, Tim Sherwood needs to put on his thinking hat and turn its clubs fortunes before it’s too late. \nTim Sherwood could have a number of his players back from the international break, with Adama Traore, Gabby Agbonlahor and summer signing Tiago Ilori all likely to be in contention. \nJores Okore, Ciaran Clark and Gary Gardner are all nearing full fitness but less likely to recover in time to feature. \nExpected 11: Guzan; Amavi, Lescott, Richards, Hutton; Gueye, Westwood, Veretout; Grealish, Gestede, Ayew \nRecent Form", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:07:31.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
