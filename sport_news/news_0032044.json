The Cougars also yielded a season-low 262 yards while moving one-half game in front of No. 18 Memphis and Navy in the AAC's West Division. \nWard, who also passed for a score, played behind a line missing ill center Colton Freeman , forcing freshman Will Noble into his collegiate debut. Converted defensive lineman Mason Denley made his first career start at left guard and another ex-DL Kameron Eloph saw time as a backup. \nHouston has been forced to scramble after season-ending injuries to Ben Dew , Zach Johnson and Josh Thomas . The Cougars are holding walk-on tryouts for offensive and defensive linemen this week to bolster their depth. \n\"Sometimes I don't even know who is out there playing offensive line. We've gotten to that point,\" coach Tom Herman joked. \"I've never been around a team that's been forced to play so many young guys at that position and still feel like we've got a chance to be pretty decent on offense.\" \nThe Cougars shouldn't have too many issues, even with their makeshift lines, this weekend against the Knights (0-7, 0-3), but Herman isn't taking them lightly. Houston is seeking its fourth start of 7-0 or better and won its first 12 contests in 2011. \nHerman is seeking the second-best start to a coaching career in program history. John Jenkins won his first eight games in 1990. \n\"Maybe I'm naive to the fact, but I don't think (my players) know what Central Florida's record is. I hope they don't,\" the Houston coach said. \"This is a team that's two years removed from winning the Fiesta Bowl last I checked. They done an excellent job of recruiting throughout the years, have an excellent staff and excellent head coach. \n\"I don't know why they're 0-7. That's not for me to figure out. They also went into (Temple) and had a lead against one of the best teams in our conference.\" \nUCF led by two points entering the fourth quarter last week against Temple, then was outscored 16-0 in those 15 minutes in a 30-16 loss. The Knights forced four turnovers but finished with 134 yards, their lowest total in seven years. \nJustin Holman went 10-of-31 for 67 yards. The junior has topped 245 yards in two of his other four games. \nHolman went 6 of 18 for 101 yards at Houston last October but also tossed a pair of TDs in a 17-12 victory. \nIn his first game moving back to quarterback from wide receiver, Ward fumbled in the final minute while trying to dive for the go-ahead touchdown and the ball went out of bounds for a touchback. \n\"It's going to be a tough game. Houston is playing with a lot of confidence now, and they should be,\" Knights coach George O'Leary said. \"I think they're doing well in all phases of the game.\" \nThe Cougars are 1-5 in the all-time series and have lost four in a row. They're 0-3 at UCF and took a 19-14 loss to a then-No. 19 team in their most recent visit in November 2013. \nHouston also fell 37-32 in Orlando in November 2009 in its only other matchup with the Knights as a ranked team (No. 13). 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:16:24.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
