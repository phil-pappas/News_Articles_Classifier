The Tigers (11-2 record) took a 6-1 lead into halftime, with Luis Garcia assisting Flores on two scores. Garcia recorded the game’s first goal in the opening minute. He finished with two goals and four assists. Dayton’s Jose Gonzalez promptly tied the score at a goal apiece, before Prescott took off on a 10-0 run. The Tigers’ Jonathan Albarran started the run at the 20th minute, hitting the back of the net to put Prescott back ahead, this time for good. The Florez-Garcia connection produced Prescott’s next four goals, all in the first half, and Flores opened the second period with a self-assisted goal at the 42nd minute for a 7-1 lead. Prescott’s Manny Sanchez assisted Chris Gutierrez on the Tigers’ next goal, two minutes before Sanchez added a self-assisted score. Prescott’s Jovanny Zuniga soon tallied the Tigers’ last two goals, capping off their scoring at the 55th minute. Dayton’s Tay Higgins scored the Bulldogs’ second goal at the 78th minute. Tigers goalie Jose Iglesia had three saves. Prescott next plays Saturday at Spokane against Valley Christian.
