Eighteen months ago Finn was deemed \"unselectable\" by England after he suffered a crisis of confidence - and technique - during the 2013/14 Ashes tour. \nBut he made a triumphant return in this summer's Ashes, taking 6-79 at Edgbaston. \nJordan, who missed much of the county season with a side injury, played the last of his eight Tests against the West Indies in Barbados in April.
