The Dukes gave Oak Park-River Forest a tough test before falling 21-6 on Oct. 2. By JASON ROSSI - jrossi@shawmedia.com \nELMHURST – On the surface, a 21-6 loss against Oak Park-River Forest would seem like a disappointing outcome for York’s football team. Related Links High school football: York ready to rebound in quest for playoff spot \nAnd while the Dukes weren’t pleased with a loss that dropped their record to 2-4 overall, they did see plenty of silver lining. \n“Our kids are positive even though our record is not necessarily where we want it to be,” York coach Matt Monken said. “They see a big difference from last year. We’re playing teams tough and tight.” \nLast season the Huskies breezed past the Dukes 49-8. OPRF entered the game as one of the more prolific offenses in the West Suburban Silver and had scored more than 40 points in each of its previous three games, but this time around, a strong game by the defense kept OPRF in check and kept York in the game. \n“Chris McCoy has been playing unbelievable at defensive end, and [5-foot-9] Sean Ward had a 6-foot-4 receiver on him and he did a nice job on him,” Monken said. \nMonken added the play of linebackers Rob Hanrahan and Quinn Gaughan also was a bright spot. \nDefensive back Jack Julian had a presence on both sides of the ball as he took snaps at quarterback in relief of John DiCanio. \nJulian led a scoring drive in the fourth quarter, but it wasn’t enough for the Dukes. \n“Our kids are playing good, it’s just a few little things,” Monken said. “Two punts being blocked killed us.” \nThe loss dropped York to 0-3 in the West Suburban Silver although those three losses came against two currently undefeated teams (Glenbard West and OPRF) and a team that just took its first loss (Hinsdale Central, which lost against Glenbard West). The Dukes started the season with a hard-fought loss against New Trier, which currently is 6-0. \n“Obviously we’ve played a tough schedule,” Monken said. “It was only the Hinsdale Central game that got out of control. Overall, our kids are playing really well. They’re fighting and competing.” \n– \nWho: York at Proviso West \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Oct. 9 \nWhere: 4701 Harrison St., Hillside \nRecords: York 2-4 (0-3), Proviso 1-5 (0-3) \nOutlook: If the Dukes hope to reach the playoffs, they can’t afford to lose another game. The Panthers struggled before winning against Proviso East on Oct. 3, having scored just 13 points total in their previous four games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:01:39.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
