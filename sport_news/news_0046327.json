I just hope I can play as well as I did today.\" \n- 'Problem child?' - \nKyrgios has been introduced by the local Japanese cable broadcaster showing the Japan Open this week as: \"Genius? Or problem child?\" \nBut despite the controversy that follows the temperamental Aussie around the men's ATP Tour, he behaved impeccably against Bautista Agut, the highlight a between-the-legs half volley to secure a break at the start of the second set. \nKyrgios, fined recently for a sexual insult aimed at Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend during a match against the Swiss, closed out the match with a pummelling serve down the middle after just 56 minutes on court. \n\"I don't want to get too far ahead of myself,\" said the Australian when asked about the possibility of capturing his first title. \"Obviously you've got guys like Stan and Kei who have been in grand slam finals and can play unbelievable tennis. \n\"I feel like I'm one of the underdogs,\" added Kyrgios, who faces Frenchman Benoit Paire -- 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 conqueror of Cyprus's Marcos Baghdatis -- in the quarters. \"But I definitely feel like I'm maturing. Whatever happens, happens.\" \nTop seed Wawrinka is not scheduled to face Kyrgios until the final in Tokyo in what would make for a spicy encounter. \nHe and Nishikori both had the day off after booking their places in the quarter-finals on Wednesday. \nWawrinka, the French Open champion, will play American Austin Krajicek in the last eight after he beat Portugal's Joao Sousa (POR) 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.
