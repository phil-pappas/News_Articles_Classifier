However, Devin Lucien still had not gotten over an overturned call earlier in that nullified a diving catch, so forgive him if his enjoyment of the score was a bit muted. \n\"I was still skeptical of the last call, so I wasn't able to fully enjoy the touchdown,” Lucien said. “After I scored and seeing all the guys' faces and everyone coming up to me, I was thankful.\" \nTo be fair, it was a helluva catch . Initially ruled a completion, a review ruled that the ball hit the ground outside of Lucien’s grasp. The disappointment in that decision is still irking Lucien. \n\"I've made catches like that before in practice, but in a game, that's probably the No. 1 catch I've made,” Lucien said. “When I watched it on the big board at Sun Devil Stadium, it didn't hit the ground. My hand was clearly under the ball. I made that effort, because I knew it was going to be close. When it was overturned, I was in shock. I'm telling you, that play was on my mind the entire the rest of the game.\" \nThe touchdown and the technically-not-a-catch were the latest examples of Lucien finding his place and comfort zone within the Sun Devil offense after transferring over from UCLA over the summer. \n\"I feel like I'm doing fine,” Lucien said. “I have my own packages that they have me in, and I try to take advantage of the time I'm in. Hopefully I can help the team win.\" \nLucien is currently tied for second on the team with 20 receptions and fifth with 220 yards. So with the team at the midway point of the season, what midterm grade would Lucien give himself? \n\"I'd give myself an A,” he said. “Every time the ball has been thrown to me so far, it's been damn near a catch. I feel like I'd give myself an A, but you know, my A would be a coach's D.\" \nThe transition to ASU from UCLA has not always been smooth. He had to learn a new offense, get to know his new teammates, and earn the trust of the coaching staff. \n\"It was difficult, because you feel like you are making plays, but your coach is still telling you that you are messing up,” Lucien said. \"There were never any rough edges with the way we came at each other, it was just 'You need to do it our way.' When you learn something for four years, then you come into a different place and they want you to do it in a different way, it's going to take some time.\" \nWhile the ASU coaches have been hard on him in looking to unlock his potential, no one has come down harder on Lucien than himself. \n\"I'm my own worst critic. I try to get everything perfect,” Lucien said. “Not only am I on myself for what I can do better, but I'm thinking about what the next person is doing, so I can be better than them. I feel like it's going to add to my game.\" \nThose efforts are now paying off. As Lucien has grown more comfortable on the field in recent weeks, the offense’s effectiveness has also increased. \nOver the last two games—wins over No. 7 UCLA and Colorado—the Sun Devils have posted season-high point totals of 38 and then 48. The passing game, plagued by inconsistency all year, has finally found a grove as quarterback Mike Bercovici has developed a rhythm with the revamped group of wide receivers. Most noticeably, the team is attacking downfield more often, with Lucien and Tim White being the top targets. \n\"It's good, but we can't do that without running the ball,” Lucien said of ASU’s vertical passing attack. “It takes a lot to get a pass down the field. You need your linemen blocking, you need your quarterback to make a great read, you need the running back pass protecting, you need your receivers to run a great route. A lot goes into throwing the ball downfield. Hopefully we can keep doing that and progressing.\" \nASU will need their passing game firing on all cylinders this Saturday when they travel to Salt Lake City to take on No. 4 Utah. The Utes feature one of the nation’s most effective and physical defenses, putting points at an even greater premium. \n\"Their front seven is really good,” Lucien said. “That front seven, being as good as it is, gives the DBs a little bit of weight off their shoulders. They are an all-around great defense. They are coached by a great coach in (Kyle) Whittingham. He recruited me. We have to match their effort.\" \nBeyond the hard-nosed Utes, the Sun Devils will also have to contend with the raucous atmosphere of Rice-Eccles Stadium. Despite holding just over 45,000 fans, it’s one of the most hostile road venues in the Pac-12, and playing efficiently will require the Sun Devils to be mentally sharp. \n\"We have to stay poised,” said Lucien. “Understand that it is just another game. Just think of it like we are playing at Sun Devil Stadium. It's going to be loud regardless of where you play. Away or not, we need to go out and play our best game.\" \nWith the first touchdown for the maroon-and-gold out of the way, Lucien is ready to add many more over the second half of the season. If ASU is going to continue to stay in the Pac-12 race, Lucien and the offense will need to continue their strong play of late. \nLucien thinks they are up for the challenge. \n\"With the plays that Coach (Mike) Norvell calls, which are absolutely ridiculous in a good way, if we go out there and execute, the sky's the limit for the offense.\" \nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
