So far, Texas has become road kill at Notre Dame and bounced back against Rice.\nThe Longhorns are into the second game with Jerrod Heard as the starting quarterback and Jay Norvell as offensive coordinator. Because the offense was so bad and so in need in change, the defense got a pass.\nNow, that side of the ball is in the spotlight this week against prolific Cal quarterback Jared Goff, a potential first-round NFL draft choice, and the Bear Raid offense. Texas will have to be much, much better than it has showed in the first two games. The Bears opened as a 1.5-point favorite and the figure quickly climbed to the current 6.5 points.\nGiven where Texas ranks nationally in a couple of key categories, the movement makes sense.\n-- Texas is 114th of 127 Football Bowl Subdivision teams in total defense, yielding 494.5 yards per game.\n-- The Longhorns are allowing 33 points a game to rank 104th nationally.\n-- And the stat that may bother the coaching staff more than any is that Texas is dead last in third-down conversion defense, with opponents converting 22 of 35 this season.\n\"Defensively we have to get off the field on third down,\" coach Charlie Strong said. \"We call that the money down. What's happening right now is too many conversions, whether it be missed sacks, pressure, missing tackles. Just have to do a better job overall defensively.\"\nStruggling against Notre Dame and Malik Zaire before his season-ending injury is one thing. But Rice and Driphus Jackson had four third-down conversions alone on a 16-play, 87-yard touchdown drive.\n\"We get to third down and it's like we fall apart,\" safety Dylan Haines said. \"When it's third down you tense up and try and make a play instead of just staying disciplined and trusting your teammates to do their job.\"\nThe defensive line, viewed before the season as a strength, has struggled with defensive tackles Desmond Jackson and Hassan Ridgeway both slowed by past injuries. Jackson admitted the third-problems have become a matter of pride.\nEven when Texas has been in a position to make big plays, it's eluded them. Strong said Texas missed eight potential sacks against Rice.\nGoff isn't nearly as mobile as Zaire and Jackson. He's a pocket passer, so that might invite Texas to blitz more to create sacks or at least pressure.\nIt could also backfire. Goff has a quick release, is accurate (73.2 completion percentage) and possesses a talented group of receivers, with five having caught touchdowns already this season.\nTexas just might not have a choice.\n\"We played tentative,\" defensive coordinator Vance Bedford said. \"We need to let it go and see what happens. It's like riding a roller-coaster.\n\"Throw your hands up in the air and wave them around like you just don't care.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-19T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:01:15.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
