Oshie and Jason Chimera also scored for Washington, and Evgeny Kuznetsov added three assists. The Capitals, playing their first road game of the season, have opened with four wins in five games. \nBraden Holtby stopped 17 shots for Washington. \nSean Monahan and Mark Giordano scored for Calgary, which has lost five of their first six games while opening with four straight losses on home ice for the first time in franchise history. \nTwo points through six games also equals the club's worst overall start. In 1997-98, Calgary began the season 0-4-2. \nOvechkin gave the Capitals the lead for good 30 seconds into the second period. His long shot was stopped by Flames goalie Karri Ramo but mishandled, allowing the Washington captain to poke in the rebound and put Washington ahead 2-1. It was Ovechkin's fourth goal of the season and 900th career point. \nThe Capitals then stretched their cushion to 4-1 halfway through the second on goals 41 seconds apart by Backstrom and Oshie. \nFirst, Justin Williams — with all five Flames skaters focused on him behind the net — fed the puck to an uncovered Backstrom in the slot and he hammered a one-timer past Ramo. \nThen Oshie drove to the top of the crease, knocked Dougie Hamilton out of the way with a hit, and promptly converted Kuznetsov's centering pass before Hamilton could recover. \nThat goal ended the night for Ramo, who exited with 14 saves on 18 shots. He was replaced by Jonas Hiller, who gave up two more goals on 12 shots. \nThe Flames continue to look for answers in net. Ramo and Hiller have split the first six games so far and both have struggled. Calgary is carrying three goalies, with 24-year-old Joni Ortio also on the roster. \nAfter Monahan put the Flames on the scoreboard nine minutes into the first period, Burakovky tied it thanks to a setup from Kuznetsov, who stripped the puck from Dennis Wideman. \nNOTES: Calgary C Joe Colborne (broken thumb) made his season debut after missing the first give games. ... Ortio has yet to even dress as the backup. He hasn't played since his last preseason appearance on Oct. 1. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:09:58.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
