So what are our sample sizes? With Peyton Manning, we know that he has been pretty awful for an entire calendar year now. A year is a long time. And with Landry Jones, we know that he has a 149.3 quarterback rating for his entire NFL career. Like, the whole thing. Someone's entire career is the biggest sample you can get. In conclusion, Landry Jones is a significantly better quarterback than Peyton Manning is now or ever was. A random list of random things \n1. Bill Belichick said that he expected the Colts to try some trick plays in the game. “A gadget game in the kicking game—onside kick, some kind of fake. It’s something they’ve done in the past. We didn’t know what the play was going to be, obviously.” Yeah, of course, “obviously,” coach! Why would you feel the need to even add that word? How would you, Bill Belichick, know the specific play an opponent would run? It’s an absurd notion, and I don’t know why you would even allude to such a thing. \n2. You almost have to feel bad for Chuck Pagano. He was going against Belichick, a guy who knows the rule book so well, the Patriots pull off formations other teams think are illegal, but aren’t—and then Pagano tries his trick play and not only is it a disaster, but also the formation was illegal. He’s like a kid who spent a year on his science fair project in hopes of beating the smartest kid in the class, only to blow himself up with his baking soda volcano and then get detention for leaving his body parts all over the gym. \n3. Pagano said the botched play was the result of a “communication breakdown.” It went like this: Pagano said, “Hey, I have a great idea for a play.” And then someone on his staff accidentally said: “O.K., let’s do it,” instead of what they mean to say: “Good god, man. That’s insane. Did Jim Irsay think that up?” Simple communication error. \n4. Good try, 12s. Good try. Fire alarm at 530am 👀 — Jonathan Stewart (@Jonathanstewar1) October 18, 2015 \nBut you people should know that sleep is overrated for football players. Do you not following the inspirational, no-sleep-advocating tweets of your beloved quarterback or what? When life knocks you down try to land on your back...because if you can look up, you can get up. #NoTime2Sleep — Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) August 14, 2015 \nAll you did is cause the Panthers to become great. \n5. Tough week for the brothers Harbaugh. First Jim Harbaugh lost on a run-off muffed punt and then John saw his team’s season spiral deeper down the toilet with a loss to the 49ers. But at least John doesn’t have to worry about his team’s punt game. Joe Flacco is an elite punter. Joe Flacco just threw the worst pass of the season... #BALvsSF https://t.co/tbjzet2jSP — Sportsbet.com.au (@sportsbetcomau) October 18, 2015 \n6. Golden Tate had a confusing touchdown yesterday that no seems to be able to explain. More people need to read the NFL Hangover. Last week’s edition featured a flowchart that explained how touchdowns are decided. One thing everyone knows, if Tate been teammate Calvin Johnson, his TD wouldn’t have counted. \n7. Of all quarterbacks who have thrown 10 or more passes this year, the leaders in passer rating are Landry Jones, then Tom Brady, then Andy Dalton. I don’t have a joke. I just wanted to write that sentence. \n8. How about that play this week, huh? The guy was all running and then the other guys were running, too, and then there was diving and then all the fans went: “W !” Crazy. \nBy the way, I should mention there’s a crackdown by leagues on posting Vines and GIFs of game footage, so we may just have to rely on my writing going forward for play descriptions. But that shouldn’t be a problem! People who write about football are considered the bards of our time, so let my descriptive and flowery language wash over you. \n9. Man, Peyton Manning sucks now, huh? It’s a tough spot that Peyton diehards are in. If you point out his awful stats—seven touchdown passes, 10 interceptions, a 72.5 quarterback rating—they say: “He’s got the only stat that matters ... UNDEFEATED.” But then every year before this one they said that his stats made him great and it wasn’t his fault that he wasn’t winning championships. It can’t be both. Peyton Manning defenders are having a bad season. (NFL defenders facing him excluded.) \n10. The Broncos are currently in the Denial phase of the Kubler-Ross Model. Ya need to get off Peyton that's our QB bottom line .You fake fans don't say anything when he is winning us the game smh — Ronnie Hillman (@MrHillman2U) October 18, 2015 \nNext comes Anger. “Why must a talented team with a real title shot have be stuck playing with an old quarterback just because no one has the guts to bench him?!” \nThen Bargaining: “I mean, maybe if we just run the ball on every snap and play great defense ... that’s playoff football anyway, right? We’re going to do this!” \nThen Depression: “We’re going to get eliminated in our first playoff game again, I know it. We’re high-altitude Bengals.” \nAnd Acceptance: “We can’t bench Peyton Manning. Let’s just let him have one last playoff elimination and then move on after the season.” \nWe’re sorry for your loss, Broncos. He was a good quarterback for a very long time.
