He came up with these factoids: since Nov. 19, 2011, when N.C. State was the last unranked team to defeat Clemson (then No. 7), a total of 50 different ranked programs have fallen as a top-25 team to a foe outside the top 25. There have been 112 instances since that third Saturday in November four years ago of a ranked team losing to an unranked team, and as Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney enunciated Tuesday, none involve the team which had a derogatory verb coined after it via Internet lexicon. “I think it’s an agenda. It’s just bias,” Swinney said of Clemsoning, three days after his postgame rant following Clemson’s 43-24 win over Georgia Tech went viral. “People are uneducated. They’re just ignorant and lazy because they’re not looking at the facts. If they did, they’d be focused on other schools and not Clemson. They’d be dialed in on what Clemson has done. There aren’t three other schools in the country as consistent as Clemson, in all aspects.” Learning lesson Florida quarterback Will Grier was assessed a one-year suspension for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs Monday, which new head coach Jim McElwain said was in an over-the-counter supplement Grier took. That’s no excuse, McElwain said Monday afternoon and Swinney reiterated with his club in a team meeting Monday evening. “It was a great opportunity to revisit that with our team,” Swinney said. “Our nutritionists give the message. If you’re going to take something, even if it’s over-the-counter, you have to get it approved. Because if you fail a test with the NCAA, you’re out. That’s just the way it is. We do everything we can to make these guys aware they’re accountable for what they put in their body.” Seven-year fix On the same day South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier announced his resignation, Swinney opened his Tuesday press conference by reflecting on this, the seven-year anniversary of Clemson appointing him interim coach after six games in 2008 when Tommy Bowden stepped down. Swinney went 4-3 the rest of that season, and was made the full-time head coach entering 2009. “This will always be a special day to me,” Swinney said. “It’s amazing to me what we’ve been able to accomplish as a program.” Going for two Offensive coordinator Tony Elliott’s wife, Tamika, is due to give birth to the couple’s second child Wednesday at 8 a.m. The couple has planned to named their second son Ace, joining 2-year-old A.J.
