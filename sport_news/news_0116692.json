A 4-0 series triumph leaves no doubt about the better team and feels like it underlines the winner’s greatness.\nWith their victory over the Cubs on Wednesday night, the Mets became the eighth team to sweep a league championship series since the L.C.S. expanded to seven games in 1985.\nThose sweeps — 13 percent of all series — were accomplished with little trouble. The winning teams all scored 18 to 22 runs in the four games; the losers never managed more than 12.\nThe most tightly contested sweep came last year, when the Royals whitewashed the Orioles but only outscored them by 18-12. The most crushing victory was in 1990. Mark McGwire hit .154, Jose Canseco hit .182 and the A’s did not hit a homer. But they still outscored the Red Sox, 20-4, and went on to be heavily favored over the Reds in the World Series.\n Mets 8, Cubs 3: Mets, Team of Big Shoulders, Sweep Cubs to Reach World Series OCT. 21, 2015 Sports of The Times: Tormenting Cubs, the Mets Are Dogged, Stoked and First to Pounce OCT. 22, 2015 The Sounds of 1908, a Fading Whisper at Wrigley OCT. 22, 2015 Cubs’ Weakness Lets the Mets Steal a Few OCT. 21, 2015 Two of the sweeping teams, the 2014 Royals and the 2007 Rockies, had swept division series as well and were 7-0 heading into the World Series.\nBefore Mets fans become too complacent about the coming series, they should be warned. This powerful set of teams did not carry good form to the next round. Only one of the seven previous sweeping teams won the World Series, the 1995 Braves. The others all fell short, and three of them were swept themselves.\nThe 2012 Tigers managed six runs in four games against San Francisco and could not stop Pablo Sandoval from hitting three homers. The 7-0 Rockies of 2007 got beat by the Red Sox, 13-1, in the opener and never recovered.\nAnd the mighty 1990 A’s, winners of 103 regular-season games, could not solve Jose Rijo and the Reds’ pitching staff and went down in one of the World Series’ biggest upsets.\nL.C.S.
