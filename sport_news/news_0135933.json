Basically, I’m going to keep preparing like I have been and however it is Saturday, that’s what I’m going to do.” \nLong is a fifth-year senior from Memphis who will return to his home state for Saturday’s game at Tennessee. \n“They were kind of from the far end,” said Long, who grew up closer to Ole Miss. “I never really liked orange.” \nLong said he graded out “pretty good,” against Alabama. He was in the game on Nick Chubb’s 83-yard touchdown run. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:27:22.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
