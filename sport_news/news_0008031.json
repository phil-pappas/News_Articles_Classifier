BolinArkansas News Bureau • ebolin@arkansasnews.com \nFAYETTEVILLE — When the opportunity arises, we like to take a look at the Arkansas football team’s next opponent through a closer lens. \nThis week Arkansas hosts Auburn in a game important for both teams’ bowl chances. We spoke with Tigers beat writer and former Razorbacks reporter Brandon Marcello of AL.com about some of the angles in today’s game. \nEric W. Bolin: The impression in Arkansas is Bret Bielema and Gus Malzahn dislike each other, despite Bielema saying otherwise. What is the impression from the Auburn perspective? \nMarcello: I don’t believe Gus Malzahn dislikes Bret Bielema. In fact, I know he doesn’t. The perceived rivalry, I believe, is nothing more than lip service from the Arkansas side of the aisle. You don’t hear Malzahn taking shots at Arkansas, but Bielema certainly isn’t shy when it comes to talking about Auburn, especially in front of fan gatherings. \nNow, having said that, they’re not good friends. They text from time to time, like some coaches tend to do when the other does something to their liking (when Auburn beat Kansas State last season, for instance, Bielema shot Malzahn a message of congratulations), but their relationship mostly ends there. \nMore than anything, I think Auburn fans view the talk from the Boston Mountains as nothing more than hot air. It’s frustrating to them more than anything. \nEB: Are the Tigers’ struggles mostly due to poor quarterback play? \nBM: Oh, no. Not even close. This team has major issues on defense, especially along the defensive line. They’re counting on youngsters in the defensive backfield, and tackling is especially suspect in the third and fourth quarters. There are issues all over the field, but I will say this: the team got better during their bye week and their first-half performance against Kentucky on a Thursday night was the best since the first-half trouncing of Louisville in the season opener. \nEB: What’s the biggest issue with the Auburn defense? \nBM: The defensive line. There’s no pass rush and the linebackers are struggling to fill gaps at times. It’s going to take another year or two for Will Muschamp to turn it around. \nEB: Seems teams know Peyton Barber will get the ball and they’re still having difficulty stopping him. How good is he, really? \nBM: Peyton Barber is not a combo-back like Tre Mason, who could pound the middle and hit the home run when needed. Barber is dependable, tough as hell and a beast to bring down at times. He’s not going to surprise anyone with his speed in the open field, but he gets stronger as the game develops. He wears opponents down. He averages only 3.1 yards per carry in the first quarter, but that average increases with every passing minute. His fourth-quarter average is a stout 6.4 yards per tote. \nEB: Is there any growing disillusionment, real or perceived, with the Malzahn regime? Will that change with the outcome Saturday? \nBM: They’re disappointed with the fact that a top-10 team in the preseason is nowhere near what they expected, but they’re seeing improvement while realizing that there were issues across the board many of us thought could be patched up in the offseason (only a handful of returning starters, a new quarterback, etc.). Will Muschamp, as good as he is as a defensive coordinator, can not wave a magic wand and fix things overnight, even if that $1.6 million salary had many believing he would do just that this season. \nIt’s only Year 3 and even I had questions on whether expectations were too high in the preseason. I asked Malzahn that very question in an interview in July, and he went with the textbook answer that championships are expected every year at Auburn. The fact is this: he did the impossible in Year 1 by winning an SEC title and going to the national championship game. Expectations were probably set too high as a result, but that’s the world we live in. He’s still building the program in his image, and this season, despite the prognostications (including from yours truly) were simply way off base. We’ll see what happens in 2016 and beyond. \nNow, a loss at Arkansas would definitely not set well with the fans. The schedule ahead gets much tougher, and a loss Saturday could mean a bowl-less season for the Tigers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:34:48.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
