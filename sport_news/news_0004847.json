There was a lot less suspense at the other sectional at Houston, where the Mustangs defeated Dyer County 25-10, 25-14, 25-11 to advance for the ninth time in 10 years.\n\"I can't stop shaking right now,\" said White Station senior standout Abigail Duncan. \"It really hasn't hit me yet.\n\"We're just like the underdog team. We don't have a lot of players that play club (volleyball), whereas with other teams the majority of the starters do. We won with our raw talent and our fight.\"\nSaid first-year Spartans coach Teresa Thomas: \"I can hardly believe it. They've just worked so hard all year and I'm so proud.\"\nWith Bartlett looking out of sync early, the fired-up Spartans took the first two sets before the Panthers regrouped to take the third.\nThe fourth set was epic. White Station led 24-19 before the Panthers rallied to tie at 24. The momentum shifted back and forth before White Station finally prevailed, setting off a wild celebration.\n\"I think the difference was our serving and passing,\" said Thomas. \"It all came together today.\"\nAt Houston, the Mustangs used their size advantage to overpower the Choctaws. Coach Becky Pendleton's team went through a frustrating lull midway through the season but appears to be back on track at the right time.\n\"We're OK,\" she said. \"We have seven seniors and not all seven can play (at the same time). And we moved some people around; we were middle-heavy but only had one outside hitter.\n\"And we've always been known for our defense, but our defense didn't really come together until the Mid-Tennessee tournament (earlier this month). We're finally starting to block and dig.\"\nIN SOCCER\nSt. George's advanced to the Division 2-A West Regional title game, beating ECS 5-4 on penalties after the two battled through regulation and overtime tied at 2.\nGoalkeeper Sydney Lanyon saved a penalty in the shootout before freshman Annie Fogleman converted the winner.\nThe Gryphons (8-6-4) host USJ in Tuesday's title game. ECS (15-3-0) will play St. Mary's for third.\nIN FOOTBALL\nMitchell 58, Oakhaven 0: Mitchell quarterback Wesley Bacchus had a perfect game to lead the Tigers (5-3, 3-0 Region 8-2A) to an easy victory over the Hawks (0-8, 0-5).\nThe senior attempted just five passes but completed all of them for touchdowns covering 225 yards. Bacchus' scoring throws went 43 and 38 yards to Isaiah Thompson, 29 yards to Jason Woodard, 65 yards to DeAndre Bobo and 50 yards to Geno Taylor.\nParron Hooker had scoring runs of 9 and 23 yards and Ladarius Love returned a fumble 80 yards for a touchdown as Mitchell held Oakhaven to 21 total yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:37:42.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
