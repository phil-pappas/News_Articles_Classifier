The teams did that and also did their own fundraisers to help Will.” \nJust a few examples of the efforts of the schools in the nine-member conference: Abbotsford sold towels and yard signs that read \"Will Power.\" Assumption used its 50/50 raffle proceeds to raise money to donate and Greenwood/Granton sold T-shirts. \n“The Cloverwood is a tight-knit conference and our kids have competed against (Maki) and his teams in several sports, so we wanted to do what we could to help out,” Gilman coach Robin Rosemeyer said. “I’ve known him from coaching against his teams and he’s such a good kid that you want to do something to help. The people who organized this event deserve a lot of credit for putting together a great event to support Will.” Buy Photo From left, Will Maki shares a laugh with friend Bailey Karaba, Owen-Withee football coach Terry Laube and his wife Cathy Laube during the Will Power fundraiser at Munson Bridge Winery in Withee, Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015.
