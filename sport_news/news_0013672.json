A spokesman for Solder's agent, David Dunn, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\nAs the left tackle, Solder was responsible for protecting quarterback Tom Brady's blindside. Solder was hurt on Sunday after a play late in the second quarter in which Cowboys defensive tackle Tyrone Crawford went by him for one of five sacks of Brady.\nSolder then left the field holding his right arm, and he was replaced in the second half by Marcus Cannon.\n\"Nate is a big part of our team and the group in the locker room,\" receiver Julian Edelman told members of the Indianapolis media on a conference call. \"He's a guy that's a true professional. All that means is that other guys have to step up.\"\nThe defending Super Bowl champions are 4-0 heading into Sunday's game against Indianapolis. Colts defensive lineman Kendell Langford said it did not change his team's approach.\n\"Well, he's their starting left tackle. So I'm pretty sure it's a significant loss for them,\" he said. \"They've got Tom Brady and they've got him (Solder) trying to protect his blind side. But again, it's next man up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:21:09.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
