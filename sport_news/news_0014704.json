Vernon, who finished in 20:00.2. Last year, Bushue won the race. Kallem finished third behind her as a sophomore. \"Shelby set her sights early on what she wanted,\" Griffith said. \"She tried to stay with Kate last year and set her sights on beating her this year. She's worked so dilligently to make that forward progress. She has a great work ethic.\" And she did it with a different strategy than usual. \"She went out a little quicker today and her third mile was her slowest and it's usually her fastest,\" Griffith said. \"She's like a steam train that builds up.\" Kallem was a few seconds slower than Saturday when she ran the same course at the Centralia Invitational. But with nobody to chase in front of her, she saw what could be done with the alternate strategy moving forward into the postseason races. \"It's hard to run fast when you're in front of everybody,\" Griffith said. \"Usually she keeps behind the front girls for the first mile and then passes them on the second mile and holds steady until the end. Today she went out and wanted it.\" Shelby's sister, freshman Sydney Kallem, also earned all-conference honors with a seventh-place finish in 21:02.2. Marion's next best finisher was Quincy Gordon, who placed 20th in 23:51.8. Ana Cuartas was 25th (24:35.8). The Lady Wildcats were third as a team behind Mt. Vernon and Carbondale, but were without Marissa Basi and Maddie Bruce, who both could potentially return along with both Kallems, Gordon and Cuartas next season. Also running for Marion's girls were Kareli Rodriguez (27th, 24:41), Tamara Keene (35th, 27:09), Kayla Keene (36th, 28:10), Katie Nance (38th, 28:55), Rose Perkins (47th, 32:45) and Faith Hudgens (48th, 33:46). In the boys race, Marion junior Zach Young placed third in 16:33.8 behind Carbondale's Atlantis Green (16:18.2) and Micah Cherry (16:30.0). Young was fourth at the conference meet last year. The Wildcats had two more runners claim all-conference medals in Ryan Melvin, who placed seventh in 17:05.2, and Jade Chew, who was eighth in 17:19.6. \"Mt. Vernon had four all-conference and we had the second most,\" said Marion coach Eli Baker. \"So that shows our potential if everyone comes back how strong we could be next year.\" Page 2 of 2 - Mt. Vernon had just 41 points to win the team title by one point over Carbondale, with Marion third at 57. \"This was kind of where I anticipated we'd be,\" Baker said. \"We're really young and we haven't beat these teams most of the year. But our times were good so you can't be mad at them. They set really good times for themselves.\" Also running for Marion were A.J. Segers (19th, 18:10), C.J. Wrolson (20th, 18:14), Julian McPhail (22nd, 18:38), Lucas Moake (29th, 19:08), Tim Surburg (36th, 19:45), Chase Moake (40th, 20:09), Peyton Robison (41st, 20:09), Tristan Stricklin (42nd, 20:15), Peer Poremba (44th, 20:23), Darryl Sullivan (52nd, 21:18), Ethan Frick (55th, 21:44), Austin Williams (60th, 22:21) and Luke Rakers (65th, 23:26). Marion runs again at the Benton Invitational on Monday.
