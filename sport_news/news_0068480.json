The Hoyas beat the Hawks last year for the first time. If they can do it again, they will secure their first winning season since 2008. Game: Harrison (5-2, 2-1) at Hillgrove (5-3, 3-1), 7:30 p.m.Last year: Harrison 43, Hillgrove 42All-time series: Hillgrove leads 4-1Prediction: Harrison 24, Hillgrove 17Harrison’s visit to Hillgrove today is one game both teams desperately want to win. The winner will likely be assured a playoff spot and will hold the No. 3 seed in Region 4 . The loser would fall to the No. 4 seed, and would still have work to do. The way the teams are playing, this game could mirror last year, when Harrison won 43-42.“If we are fortunate to win, I don’t care what the score is,” Harrison coach Matt Dickmann said.Harrison is playing its best football in more than five years. Its defense has been solid and its offense is moving the chains. Hillgrove, however, is the more experienced team in this situation, having won the Region 4 title last season, and it is coming off back-to-back appearances in the Class state quarterfinals.Hillgrove has found success rotating quarterbacks. Matthew Wilson was hurt at the beginning of the season and missed a couple of games. Hunter Arters took over under center and is having a breakout season, while Bryson Parks has also played well. The quarterbacks also have the benefit of freshman running back Jaylen McCollough, who has run for 666 yards and four touchdowns.Hillgrove bounced back from its loss to North Cobb two weeks ago with decisive wins over North Paulding and Kennesaw Mountain. A win over Harrison would give the Hawks confidence going into their bye week before closing out the regular season at McEachern. “It’s big for both teams,” Dickmann said. “We both want to win this game. We would be in the driver’s seat for the playoffs. We want to win this week so we don’t have the added pressure of the last two weeks.”Harrison’s success offensively this season starts with an offensive line led by center Danny Connors and linemen Mason Tompkins, Trey Iorillo, Ryan Boler and Casey Chenault. They’re a big reason why Darius Clark is sixth in Cobb County with 782 yards and has 14 touchdowns.Defensively, Harrison’s Dexter Davis is the county leader in interceptions with five. C.J Turner leads the Hoyas with 72 tackles, and Seth Simmer is second in the county with seven sacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:51:31.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
