Head coach Jim Caldwell pulled him out of the game after his third interception, which led to the Cardinals gaining a 35-7 lead in the third quarter of a game the Lions lost, 42-17. More from NBC Montana NHL roundup: Lightning stop winless... \n\"It's like a pitcher not having a very good day,\" Caldwell said of the decision. \"If a pitcher comes out, obviously he's still the starter.\" \nStafford threw three interceptions and finished the game 20 of 32 for 191 yards and one touchdown. He said Caldwell told him at halftime that he'd be pulled if he threw a third pick after throwing two in the first half, leading to his benching after the first second-half drive. \n\"We had nothing going at that time,\" Caldwell said of the decision. \"No spark, no explosiveness, no nothing.\" \nThe Lions finished the game with six turnovers, including three in a second quarter the Cardinals won 28-0. They also had nine penalties for 85 yards, stopping progress on multiple promising drives and costing them lots of field position on special teams. \nBut, after backup quarterback Dan Orlovsky entered to cheers in the third quarter, the quarterback decision remained the topic of discussion Monday, and Caldwell said Stafford isn't on a short leash. \n\"He's never been on a leash,\" Caldwell said. \"He's never been on any sort of a leash, and he won't be in the future.\" \nPlenty of Lions players accepted blame for the embarrassing loss and said they all need to play better to support their quarterback. The Lions are 0-5 for the first time since their 0-16 season in 2008. \n\"You can't play like that,\" safety James Ihedigbo said. \"Since I've been in the NFL, it's the worst football I've seen - let alone being part of it.\" Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
