Thorpe sailed wide.\nJohns completed 17 of 33 for 209 yards and a touchdown with an interception. The Cavaliers have dropped 12 straight road games dating back to 2012.\nPitt never trailed and appeared on the verge of an early blowout but needed a late stand to preserve its best start in six years.\nPitt coach Pat Narduzzi stressed he wouldn't allow his team to get to high after an emphatic road win at Virginia Tech last week. The Panthers certainly came out sharp, racing to a quick 17-3 lead. Peterman hit tight end Scott Orndoff for a 37-yard touchdown pass on game's fifth play, Chris James ripped off a 48-yard sprint to set up a 4-yard scoring run by Ollison later in the first quarter and the Panthers appeared to be in firm control.\nVirginia, two weeks removed from a 42-point home loss to Boise State, struggled to gain any traction. Several times the Cavaliers had receivers running open deep in the secondary in the first half only to narrowly miss a momentum-turning play. The defense, surprisingly, produced a touchdown when Mike Moore hit Peterman. The ball popped up in the air and defensive end Kwontie Moore snagged it, taking the first turnover produced by Virginia all season and chugging 27 yards to the end zone to bring the Cavaliers within 17-10.\nPitt extended its lead back to 13 when Matt Galambos returned an interception 51 yards to set up Tyler Boyd's pretty 8-yard touchdown reception. When Johns was tackled in the end zone for a safety, the Panthers were up 26-13.\nThe Cavaliers made it 26-19 when Johns found Canaan Severin for a 32-yard score with 5:50 to play. Given one last shot, Virginia converted a fourth-and-25 and moved to the Pitt 42 with a minute to go. Four straight incompletions, however, ended any hopes of Virginia getting a win it desperately needs to breathe some life into a disappointing season.\nThings appear considerably brighter at Pitt, whose only loss is a 27-24 defeat at Iowa, a game the Panthers lost on a 57-yard field goal at the gun. The defense has a newfound aggressiveness under Narduzzi. Pitt sacked Johns four times and already has more sacks this season (21) than the 19 it managed all last season.\n___\nAP College Football Website: www.collegefootball.ap.org\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
