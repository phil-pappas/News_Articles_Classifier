(AP) — Packers right tackle Bryan Bulaga could return for Sunday’s game against St. Louis after missing the last three weeks with a left knee injury. \nCoach Mike McCarthy says Bulaga is doing well after the first two days of practice. Bulaga says he won’t talk about Sunday, though he is happy with his progress. \nHe was listed as questionable on Friday for the Rams game, though his status could change after the team’s next practice on Saturday. \nGetting Bulaga back would boost a front five that must match up against St. Louis’ tough defensive front. \nBulaga missed the 2013 season with a torn ligament in his left knee. He says rehab for the latest injury has gone well. When asked if he was optimistic about Bulaga’s availability for Sunday, McCarthy said “So far, so good, yes.” \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:42:46.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
