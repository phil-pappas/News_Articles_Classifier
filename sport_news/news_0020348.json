The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association announced on Sunday morning the state tournament pairings, with the playoffs beginning on Friday. After capping off a perfect regular season with a 35-6 win over Norwell, East Bridgewater (7-0) earned the No. 1 seed and home field advantage throughout the Division 5 South Sectional. The Vikings will face off against eighth-seeded Dover-Sherborn (5-2) with the game expected to be played Friday night at 7. “We’re thrilled to be in this position,” said East Bridgewater head coach Shawn Tarpey. “Playing at home is what everybody wants to do. You don’t want to travel, especially with the new playoff system and going to some place you haven’t been to before.” The Vikings were in a similar spot last season, receiving the top overall seed and making a run to the South Sectional final. East Bridgewater is the favorite to get back to that point and surpass it, while leaning on the experience gained from last year’s postseason. “These guys are hungry,” Tarpey said. “They want to improve on what we did last year and that means getting out of the South. Again, we can’t get there because Dover-Sherborn is in our way. The whole experience I think is huge. We still have a long way to go and no one is going to give us anything.” Also in the Vikings’ bracket is Cardinal Spellman (7-0), which captured the Catholic Central League title with a 35-12 win over Bishop Fenwick last Friday night, notching the No. 2 seed and an opening-round matchup with Thanksgiving Day rival No. 7 Archbishop Williams (5-2) this Friday at 6 p.m. “I would say the positive part of it is we’re very familiar with them and what they do,” said Cardinal Spellman head coach Ron St. George. “Not only are we familiar with their scheme, but we’re familiar with their personnel. So, there’s a comfort zone there as oppose to playing somebody you’re not familiar at all.” Abington (6-1) is in the Division 5 South as well, receiving the No. 4 seed, and hosts Greater New Bedford Voc. Tech. (5-2) on Friday at 7 p.m. Elsewhere, Bridgewater-Raynham edged Brockton for the No. 2 seed in Division 1 South, which was decided by a coin flip since both teams had identical power rankings. The Trojans (4-3) get a home game against seventh-seeded Weymouth (4-3), with a date and time to be determined, while the third-seeded Boxers (5-2) take on No. 6 Newton North (5-2) at Marciano Stadium on Friday at 7 p.m. Page 2 of 2 - For Brockton head coach Peter Colombo, he said he it didn’t make much of a difference losing the coin flip to B-R since the Division 1 South field is one of the toughest in the tournament. “(B-R’s) win Saturday (over St. John’s Prep) proves how competitive Division 1 is and that’s a good thing,” Colombo said. “It should be an interesting couple of weeks.” This isn’t the first time the Boxers and Tigers have collided in the postseason, as they faced off in the 1972 Super Bowl, according to Colombo, a game in which he said he played. Expectations are high for the Boxers entering the playoffs, as they try to claim the storied program’s first Super Bowl title since 2005. “This group of seniors went into the season and wanted to win a Super Bowl,” Colombo said. “They got that chance and they know as we all do that there will be only one team standing at the end and if you’re not in this category this week then you’re not playing for that. We are and will take our chances with whoever we have to play each week.” In the Division 3 bracket, No. 5 Stoughton (4-3) travels to No. 4 Walpole (5-2) in the Southwest Sectional with game date and time to be determined, while No. 8 Whitman-Hanson (4-3) is on the road against No. 1 Dighton-Rehoboth (6-1) in the Southeast Sectional on Friday at 7 p.m. Middleboro (5-2) snuck into the playoffs due to Canton’s loss to Sharon (30-14) on Saturday and will have a rematch with Scituate (5-2), its Week 6 opponent, at Battis Field on Friday at 7 p.m. In the first go-around, the Sachems struggled against the Sailors on the road, losing, 34-14. West Bridgewater (6-1) rounds out the local teams in the playoffs, receiving a No. 4 seed, and takes on No. 5 Millis-Hopedale (4-3) at home with a date and time to be determined. It’s important to note that there is no reseeding in the playoffs, meaning the winners of the No. 1 versus No. 8 and the No. 4 and No. 5 matchups will play in one semifinal, while the No. 2 versus No. 7 and No. 3 versus No. 6 winners go up against each other in the other semifinal.
