(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) \nLOS ANGELES – Anger and confusion permeated the Mets clubhouse Saturday night, the repercussions of a slide by Chase Utley that left Ruben Tejada in a walking boot and with a crutch under his right arm following Game 2 of the NLDS at Dodger Stadium. \nMets players and coaches watched as Tejada attempted to turn a double play, only to be taken out by Utley in what several players dubbed a tackling. Tejada suffered a fractured right fibula that ended his season, and the Dodgers tied the game on the play. \nTwo batters later, the Mets trailed for the first time this series, and when the game ended this best-of-five series had been knotted at 1-all. \n“There are ways to play the game hard, only Chase knows going in there what his intent was,” Met third baseman David Wright said. “I have a problem with the play on a number of different levels, one being the slide itself.” \nEight outs from a commanding series lead, the Mets faltered in the seventh inning and fell to the Dodgers, 5-2, here on Saturday night at Dodger Stadium. While Utley was originally ruled out, the umpires later ruled him safe as Tejada hadn’t touched the bag. Adrian Gonzalez later hit a two-out, two-run double to give the Dodgers a 4-2 lead. \nNoah Syndergaard suffered the loss by allowing three runs in 6 1/3 innings. \n“We’ll control it, but, yeah, they’re angry,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “You lose in a playoff series to that serious of an injury, yeah, they’re not very happy about it.” \nSaturday’s game, and potentially the series, changed on a play that could open the doors for a potential rule change regarding illegal interference. \nThe Mets led 2-1 in the seventh on a pair of solo homers by Yoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto, but the Dodgers had runners on the corners with one out. \nHowie Kendrick hit a ball to Daniel Murphy, and Murphy tossed the ball to Tejada, who faced the right-field stands while he caught the ball. As Tejada attempted to spin to his left to turn to fire to first, Utley crashed into Tejada’s left leg. \nTejada fell to the ground while a run scored to tie the game at 2-all, and Utley jogged off the field while Tejada lay on the ground in pain. Tejada was immediately attended to, and eventually carted off in a stretcher. Wilmer Flores is now the everyday shortstop. \nWhile no Met player called the slide dirty, they clearly were upset and believe it went beyond the line of playing the game hard. Michael Cuddyer and Kelly Johnson both described it as a tackle, and Daniel Murphy said a “slide would be generous.” \nMLB Chief Officer Joe Torre said “I thought the slide was a little late,” and indicated the league is looking into whether or not Utley needs to be disciplined. \n“There’s got to be something in (the rules) that says we got to hit dirt, we got to slide, not jump into and break fibulas and knock players out of games,” Johnson said. \nUtley told reporters he was “going hard” to try to prevent a double play and had no intention to hurt Tejada, and felt “terrible” that the shortstop was injured. Gonzalez said that any player on either team would have done the same in that situation. \nIn 2010, Utley was involved in a similar play at second base with Tejada that had Wright fuming. \n“I think you’re taught from a young age to try to break up double plays,” said Utley, who had a pinch-hit single. “That’s winning baseball.” \nUtley was originally ruled out on the play, but the play was reviewed since replays showed Tejada had not touched the bag. While baseball does have a neighborhood play for double plays where infielders don’t have to touch the bag, Torre said that Tejada’s play did not qualify since Tejada had to lunge to catch the ball and spin to try to throw it. \nHe added that Utley was not required to touch the bag since he had been called out, but Utley would have been out had Tejada tagged him at any point. \nTwo batters after the play, Gonzalez ripped a two-run double into right field off Addison Reed for a 4-2 lead, and Justin Turner followed with an RBI double to make it 5-2. \n“It’s not sour grapes, it’s not trying to call out the umpires, I’m just confused for a number of different reasons why he was called safe there,” Wright said. “Once a player is called out, you don’t go tag him, especially when you’re laying there with a broken leg.” \nAdded Johnson: “It’s it a judgment call, is it up to opinion. In my opinion, we absolutely missed something. Losing our starting shortstop for the rest of the playoffs, got a broken fibula, cost us potentially this game, and we don’t have anything to show for it?” \nAs the game changed on that one fielder’s choice, it bred life into a Dodgers team that had been overpowered by the Mets young flamethrowers for most of the series. \nThe Mets had cracked Zack Greinke early and had a chance to steal both games here against the Dodgers two aces, yet with eight outs to go it all went awry. The Dodgers capitalized on the extra out they were granted, and evened up this series. \nA cross-country flight awaited the Mets after this upsetting loss, and a pivotal Game 3 looms Monday that could swing this series. \n“We need to rebound,” Wright said. “We had our chances, they had some good at-bats after that. It’s just the one play, the turning point in this game.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:21:38.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
