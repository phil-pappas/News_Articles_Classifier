Boston traded his rights to Colorado and the Avalanche signed him to a five-year, $23.75 million contract.\nSoderberg will play against Boston for the first time when the Avalanche faces the Bruins at 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Pepsi Center.\n\"It's going to be fun,\" Soderberg said Wednesday morning. \"It's my old teammates, it's going to be a special game for sure. That's the team where I started my NHL career.\"\nSoderberg said of the 0-3 Bruins: \"It's a good organization, for sure, so I can't say anything bad about them right now. I'm an Avalanche and I am going to give my very best performance tonight, but I had good years there.\"\nHe said he wasn't bothered that the Bruins didn't find a way to make the numbers work. \"That's how the business is and the Avalanche was one of the most interested teams, so I was really glad when they wanted me.\"\nSoderberg is centering the line between rookie Mikko Rantanen and Borna Rendulic and has two assists in two games.\n\"I'm fitting in pretty good,\" he said. \"It's a different game, but I'm fitting in. The Bruins, it's more defense, here it's a skill game and faster. It's different and I can adjust to that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:23:08.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
