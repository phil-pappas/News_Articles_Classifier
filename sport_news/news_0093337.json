The video was shot on Saturday, October 17 around 4 a.m. \nSunday evening, police responded to two burglary reports near 41st Street and Sertoma Avenue. In one case, a suspect entered an unlocked home on South Morrow Drive and left with cash. \nA second report came from West Oriole Circle. A suspect entered a garage, then moved to vehicles parked nearby but police didn't find evidence that anything was stolen from that home. \nPolice think the same suspect is involved in both burglary reports. He was described by a witness as a tall, skinny man wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt. \nIf you have information on the crimes, you are asked to call Crime Stoppers at 605-367-7007.
