If the Timbers beat the last place Colorado Rapids at home in their final game of the season, they will at minimum host a knockout game and possibly even get a bye to the conference semifinal series.\nOn Tuesday, the media spoke with Timbers coach Caleb Porter , defender Jorge Villafan a and forward Fanendo Adi . Here are the key points that came out of those interviews:\nPorter said the dominant win in LA was huge for the Timbers and something they can look back on as one of their biggest regular season wins as an MLS club: \"Arguably, it was our biggest win in a regular season game in our MLS history,\" Porter said. \"We played a top team, the MLS Cup champions, and we played them on their home field and we played them at full strength and we dominated.\" The Timbers will try to build off the result in Los Angeles as they aim to close out the season with a win against Colorado. Portland's result against Colorado could have massive implications in terms of playoff seeding and Porter said the club will be prepared for the game: \"We won't take them lightly,\" Porter said. \"We have so much at stake.\" Timbers forward Fanendo Adi on win at LA, focus on Colorado Adi talks about the scoring surge at the Los Angeles Galaxy and about preparing for the Colorado Rapids. The Timbers have struggled on offense this season and arrived in LA having scored just 32 goals in 32 games. But Portland had a breakout performance on offense against the Galaxy, scoring five goals in one half for the first time in club history. Porter said he's hoping the offense can continue to perform heading into Colorado and hopefully the playoffs: \"That's big,\" Porter said. \"I was waiting for it... I knew we had it in us.\" Porter decided to use an inverted 4-3-3 formation in a 1-0 win over Real Salt Lake last week. Porter made the decision Jorge Villafana talks about Galaxy win, challenges against Colorado Villafana talked about the 5-goal offensive surge against the Galaxy and about winning at StubHub Center. to use the same formation against LA because he felt it would make Galaxy players Steven Gerrard and Juninho defend more: \"We decided to stick with it and go for it,\" Porter said. \"They aren't really built to defend for long periods. They are built to attack.\" Porter said that Will Johnson , who recently underwent a surgery to have screws removed from his right leg , trained full out Tuesday, but is still building fitness. Porter said Jack Jewsbury , who is dealing with a foot injury, could be back in full training by the end of the week. Porter said he's been in touch with U.S. National Team coach Jurgen Klinsmann about the possibility of Darlington Nagbe getting a call-up: \"He's told me he likes him, he's aware of him, he's on the radar,\" Porter said. \"He wants to bring him in, it just has to be the right time.\" Adi scored two goals against LA to help the Timbers earn the 5-2 victory. Adi now has a MLS club record 15 goals this season: \"I'm feeling good,\" Adi said. \"It's just about confidence.\"\nThe Timbers will train again Wednesday, Friday and Saturday before facing the Rapids on Sunday.
