On behalf of the club, I wish Johan and his family a lot of strength and a speedy recovery.\" \nCruyff, 68, is regarded as one of football's greatest ever players having won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1971, 1973 and 1974, and led Holland to the final of the World Cup in 1974. \nHe is most strongly associated with Ajax and Barcelona, playing for and managing both teams. \nHe oversaw a golden period at the Nou Camp, which included winning the European Cup in 1992, and has been cited as a major influence by many of those he used to manage, most notably Bayern Munich and former Barca boss Pep Guardiola. \nCruyff was a heavy smoker prior to double heart bypass surgery in 1991, after which he took to sucking lollipops on the touchline.
