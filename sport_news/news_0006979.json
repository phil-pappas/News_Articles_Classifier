Woburn is latest Middlesex League opponent dominated by Reading By BRIAN MURPHY Woburn Daily Times, Inc. | 0 comments \nREADING — One sign of a championship-caliber football team is week-to-week improvement. That certainly fits the description of the Reading High football team which put out its best performance of the season in a brisk dispatch of visiting Woburn, 42-0, Friday night at John Hollingsworth Field. \nOffense, defense, special teams — name your metric — the Rockets had it all rolling in their home opener to improve to 5-1 on the season (4-0 Middlesex League Liberty Division). Woburn fell to 2-4, and at 2-2 in the ML Liberty Division last year’s champion officially relinquished its hold on the title. \nReading’s defense was lights-out in posting its second straight shutout, holding the Tanners to 62 yards of offense and three first downs. Woburn crossed midfield just once on a 25-yard run by Doug Amaral in a drive that eventually resulted in a turnover on downs. Reading safety Will Connery returned a Tim Concannon interception 26-yards for a touchdown to open up a 21-0 at the end of the first quarter. \n“I’m thrilled with the way the game went, right from the opening. The defense played awesome — we played physical, played hard, got all over them early,” said head coach John Fiore. \nThere may not be a player in the Middlesex League as electric or dangerous in the open field as Connery. In addition to his pick-six, Connery ran back a punt 57 yards to the Woburn nine-yard line, then scored on a quick nine-yard touchdown pass in the flat from Corey DiLoreto, evading Woburn defenders like they were standing still. \nConnery’s performance came after returning a punt and kickoff for a touchdown last week against Belmont. \n“I don’t know what else to say about him—he’s playing pretty outstanding football right now,” Fiore said. “It’s all a function of our offensive line and people having to defend D’Aundray (Burcy).” \nIf Connery was the lightning Burcy brought the thunder, breaking tackles and running as hard as he has all season in racking up 126 yards on 16 carries with a touchdown. He also took a DiLoreto screen pass 47 yards to the house to open the scoring. Once again Burcy enjoyed terrific blocking up front behind the likes of Cole Murphy, Sam Ayer, Ryan Millerick, Sam Turecamo, John O’Brien, and Sean Valente. \nDiLoreto had his best passing game of the season, completing 8 of 9 attempts for 115 yards and three touchdowns, including a 25-yard laser beam to Tommy White in a post-pattern in the end zone on fourth and 15. That opened up a 14-0 Reading lead with 2:20 left in the first quarter. \nOn Woburn’s next possession Concannon faced a heavy rush and threw of his back foot at the Woburn 11. Connery picked off the pass and returned it 26 yards, making one tackler miss before turning up the left sideline. \nTrailing 21-0 late in the first quarter the Tanners’ offensive struggles continued. Tackles for losses by David DiMare, Connery, and Anthony D’Avolio resulted in a three-and-out and a punt to start the second quarter. Connery took back a 35-yard Nick Dangora punt 57 yards to the Woburn nine before scoring on a DiLoreto touchdown pass. White pushed the extra point attempt left, but Reading led, 27-0 with 10:34 remaining in the second quarter. \nReading’s defense forced a second three-and-out on Woburn’s next possession, and a 17-yard Connery punt return set Reading up at midfield. DiLoreto hit White on a 20-yard crossing pattern at the right sideline to convert a third and two. From there Burcy ran five times to close the remaining distance, scoring on a four-yard run off the blocks of center Sam Turecamo and guard John O’Brien. Burcy then punched in the two-point conversion to make it 35-0 with 4:32 remaining in the half. \nWoburn’s lone scoring opportunity came in the waning minutes of the first half but ground to a halt at the Reading 23. Amaral had Woburn’s longest play of the night, a 25-yard run around left end to the Reading 43. Reading was later assessed a 15-yard facemask penalty to set up a first and 10 at its own 28. \nBut four plays failed to move the ball any further as tackles by the likes of D’Avolio, Joe Bradley, Hunter Atwood, and Chris Merullo resulted in minimal gains. Atwood applied pressure on fourth down to force a Concannon incompletion. \nThat would be it until late in the fourth quarter when sophomore Jack Geiger scored his second touchdown of the season on a 27-yard run to cap the scoring. \nReading next hosts 5-1 Arlington Friday night (7 p.m.) for the Middlesex League Liberty Division championship. The Spy Ponders have beaten the Rockets each of the last two seasons. A win by the Rockets would wrap-up a perfect 5-0 finish in Liberty play. \nThe win will also clinch a first-round home playoff game. \n“We played hard and played physical. Woburn did as well, hats off to them and good luck the rest of the way,” Fiore said. “We want to play meaningful games at the end of the regular season and that’s coming now. We can only control what’s in front of us, and what’s right in front of us now is Arlington.” \nWoburn also has its work cut out Friday night when it hosts unbeaten (6-0) Middlesex League Freedom Division champion Melrose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:35:12.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
