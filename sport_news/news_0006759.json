The Capitals finished the 2014-15 season with a 45-26-11 record, good for 101 points and the four-seed in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Caps opened up the playoffs with a tough match up against the New York Islanders; a young, talented team looking to make a big statement in the national spotlight. \nIt was a back and forth series with both teams unwilling to give an inch, but the Caps eventually prevailed in seven games and moved onto the second round of the playoffs where the New York Rangers awaited. \nThe Caps jumped out to a commanding 3-1 series lead, but as most of you know, they could not hang on, and the Rangers ultimately won the series in seven games, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals. \nFast forward to October 10, 2015 when the Caps drop the puck in their regular season opener against the New Jersey Devils. What will be this team's identity in 2015-16? Will they be able to finish off a series instead of letting up? \nSome of the moves the Caps made this offseason addressed those concerns. Let's start with some of the key departures. \nTwo notable Caps who are not on this year's roster are defenseman Mike Green and right wing Joel Ward. Green and Ward had been Washington staples over the past few seasons, but playoff letdown after playoff letdown forced the Caps to rethink their identity, hence letting Ward and Green go. \nThe big offseason splash the Caps made was trading for super-talented right winger TJ Oshie, a move that sent now former Caps winger Troy Brouwer to St. Louis. Oshie burst onto the scene during the 2014 Winter Olympics when he scored four shootout goals for the United States in a victory over Russia. Oshie and Alex Ovechkin should combine to form a scary winger unit, whether or not they are on the same line or not. Not to mention, the Caps' power play unit just got that much better with Oshie on it. \nA more quiet move that the Caps made was signing veteran winger Justin Williams, an absolute grinder from the Los Angeles Kings whose been a part of three Stanley Cup winning teams (Carolina, 2006 and Los Angeles, 2012, 2014). Williams signed a two-year deal with the Caps in the offseason and he brings the leadership, grit and experience that past Capitals rosters have lacked, an intangible you can't find on the stat sheet. \nWilliams touched on his success in game sevens during media day on Tuesday . Justin Williams talks about his success in Game 7's, but more importantly, his teams' success in Game 7's. \nLastly, the Caps made a move for the future by signing goaltender Braden Holtby to a five-year, $30.5 million extension. In his first season as the Caps regular starter, Holtby was stellar, recording nine shutouts and boasting a .923 save percentage. The Caps went 41-20 with Holtby in the net, and the franchise decided that it was time to lockup their net minder for the foreseeable future. \nWhy make all these moves after a fairly successful season that saw the Capitals so close to a conference finals berth? Easy answer. The Caps need to make a major push for the Stanley Cup while Alex Ovechkin is still in his prime. The all-world Russian winger turned 30 in December, and although he has showed no signs of slowing down (53 goals, 28 assists in 2014-15), most players will start declining as they get deeper into their 30's. \nHead coach Barry Trotz understands the importance of winning while Ovechkin is still on top of his game. Caps HC Barry Trotz touches on Alex Ovechkin and why the time is now for Washington. \nThe time is now for Washington. This isn't a \"Stanley Cup or bust\" season for the Caps, but a trip deep into the playoffs is necessary. Barry Trotz has the team right where he wants them. They're hungry and out for revenge in some ways. Now it's just time to execute and finish the job. \nLike us on Facebook !", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:48:26.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
