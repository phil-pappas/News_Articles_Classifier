Shiva (56kg) lost 1-2 to Uzbekistan’s Asian silver-medallist Murodjon Akhmadaliev in a closely-contested bout. He is, however, still in the running for an Olympics berth as the losing semifinalists will box off on October 15 to decide the last of the three Olympics slots in this category. “It’s a part of the game, I gave it my all but it was not my day. I still have a good chance of making the Olympics, so I am looking forward to that,” said a disappointed Shiva. He will face Dzmitry Asanau in the all-important contest after the Belarusian went down to third-seeded Irish Michael Conlan in his semifinal bout. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:08:50.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
