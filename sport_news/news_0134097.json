He was moving around the pitch well, but unfortunately he felt some discomfort and we are going to lose him.\" \nMartino says it is a different injury to the one Aguero was carrying with his club. \nAguero scored five goals in 20 minutes in his last game for City — a 6-1 win over Newcastle that returned his team to the top of the Premier League. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:27:02.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
