Giants coach Tom Coughlin indicated that the much-anticipated second visit from defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul has not happened yet.\n“We’ll know more about that when it happens,” Coughlin said Tuesday. “I don’t really have a lot to talk about there.”\nPierre-Paul is expected to make an appearance in East Rutherford this week. It’s been six weeks since he first visited the team on Labor Day, finally allowing the Giants to inspect his mangled right hand. At that time, the team decided Pierre-Paul was not ready to play and he headed back to his Florida home to continue training alone.\nSince then, he’s posted a several Instagram videos in an attempt to showcase his progress, although none have clearly shown the hand he severely injured in a Fourth of July fireworks accident. The Giants did not like what they saw from Pierre-Paul during his last visit; a source told the News Sunday that some in the organization didn’t believe that the defensive end would be able to suit up at all after that first examination.\nPierre-Paul is running out of time to prove to the Giants that he’s ready. If he has not signed his one-year franchise tag tender by Nov. 17, less than a month away, he will be forced to sit out the 2015 season. He can sign the tag whenever he wants, although if the Giants don’t deem him healthy, they can still place him on the non-football injury list and will not have to pay him.\nPierre-Paul’s franchise tag tender, which loses a prorated amount each week, is now worth just $9.585 million, but he will almost certainly not be paid that full amount. The Giants plan to renegotiate the terms of the tender if they deem him healthy, possibly agreeing to not place him on NFI if he accepts a lower salary that’s prorated based on the number of games he actually plays.\nRelated Stories JPP to report back to Giants, have hand re-examined: sources Osi Umenyiora: Giants need Jason Pierre-Paul Vacchiano: Suddenly, Jason Pierre-Paul is forgotten man", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:47:52.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
