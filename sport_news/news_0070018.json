Goodell was the caretaker for two dogs. A photo captures what one of those dogs looked like then compared to now. In March Heather Henry and her husband adopted the dog and named him Gibbs. \"I just saw Gibbs. He was laying in the furthest kennel and he was just curled up into a ball, just laying on the floor all curled up, and it was just tearing up my heartstrings. I was like, 'Look at this little guy,'\" Henry said. \"So we asked to see him and we just fell in love immediately with him.\"\nThe animals at the time were divided among local humane societies, including the North Country Animal League in Morrisville.\n\"We took in 8 of them there were a few that were here a little longer because they did have pretty severe medical issues and they were in foster, our last one just left after she had been with us for 5 months,\" said the League's Sallie Scott.\nBut there is one dog that was adopted by her foster parents. A photo shows what she looked like when she was rescued. You can barely see her in the crate at the bottom of the picture.\nShe was the other dog cared for by Goodell. Her new home is with Sallie Scott and her husband. After fostering her for months, the couple say they just had to keep her. \"We fostered her -- couldn't give her up. She is what they call a 'pocket pitt,' so she looks like a pitt bull but she is tiny,\" Scott said.\nHer new name is Mary Katherine, and she is still very shy. That can be a common trait for a rescued dog, and can be a challenge for potential owners. \"Patience and love, and then there can be a lot of happy endings. But no, some of them it just doesn't work out that way,\" Holm said.\nThe good news is that most of the dogs rescued from Eden have been adopted by families who are prepared to deal with some possible personality quirks.\nRussell Goodell entered a plea agreement to two animal cruelty charges last week. He will serve five years probation, with a suspended sentence of up to a year in Jail. Carol Merchant has pleaded not guilty to felony charges.\nRelated Stories:\nEden man admits to animal cruelty\nEden woman charged with several felony counts of animal cruelty\nPolice: 2 people in Eden charged with multiple counts of animal cruelty\nDogs rescued from Eden start finding new homes Fundraising underway to help seized animals Chittenden County Humane Society seeks help caring for seized animals\nAnimals seized in Eden show improvement with medical care\nDozens of animals seized in Eden", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:54:52.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
