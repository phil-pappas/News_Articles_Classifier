USA Today Sports 17 hrs ago by Dan Wolken, USA TODAY Sports © Richard Shiro, AP How good is the South Carolina football job? COLUMBIA, S.C. — No football program in the Southeastern Conference may be tougher to peg as a \"good job\" or \"bad job\" for a potential coach than South Carolina.\nAdChoices The good: It's in the SEC. The fan base cares and will fill Williams-Brice Stadium with 80,000-plus every Saturday regardless of opponent. There are quality in-state players, and you're close to other recruiting hotbeds in Atlanta, Charlotte and Florida. Money has been poured into football facilities to bring them up to par. And South Carolina will pay a competitive SEC salary, which these days starts at $3 million.\nMORE: Spanning the SEC\nNow, the bad: Three coaches who have won national championships ended up later at South Carolina. The only one to win a conference title there was Paul Dietzel, who won the ACC there in 1969. The only coach to be consistently successful was Steve Spurrier, who put up three consecutive 11-2 seasons before things went south.\nThough there is usually some quality talent in South Carolina, you've got to fight tooth-and-nail with a red-hot in-state program (Clemson) for the small quantity of four and five-star prospects in your back yard. And though the SEC East has been the weaker division recently, South Carolina is still historically behind Florida, Georgia and Tennessee in the pecking order.\n\"We just had an iconic coach spend the last 11 years with us,\" athletics director Ray Tanner said. \"So I think that speaks volumes. There's a lot of positives.\"\nAfter conversations with several people in the coaching industry, one key factor emerged about the South Carolina job that will determine whether it's \"good\" or \"bad\" job for a hot candidate: Expectations.\nIs the bar for the new coach 8-4 or 10-2? If it's the former, South Carolina is not just a good job but an excellent one. If it's the latter, not so much.\nIf Spurrier's successor can go 5-3 in the SEC, win three relatively easy non-conference games and beat Clemson every other year or so while making $3 million, South Carolina is an excellent job.\nBut if this is a situation where fans are going to be unhappy during those inevitable years when South Carolina goes 7-5 and struggles against the \"big four\" on its schedule — Tennessee, Georgia, Florida and Clemson — this could be the type of job that chews someone up and spits them out in four years.\nThat's where Spurrier's work is both a blessing and a curse in this coaching search.\nThough he made it a much more attractive situation and proved South Carolina can compete with the SEC's big boys, there is almost no tradition or history of it outside of Spurrier. On the other hand, the factors are totally different than they were a decade ago. With facilities and TV exposure essentially equal across the board, the SEC's pecking order is more dynamic now (see the success Ole Miss, Mississippi State, etc.).\nWith that in mind, here are some candidates who make sense for South Carolina:\n► Doc Holliday: He has done an incredible job at Marshall (28-6 the last 2 1/2 years), runs a fast-paced offense, has worked in the SEC (associate head coach at Florida from 2005-07) and has a unique recruiting niche in South Florida. If you can get good players out of Miami to come to a Conference USA school in West Virginia, you can get even better players to come to South Carolina.\n► Matt Wells : He just keeps winning at Utah State no matter what kind of injuries and setbacks his team faces. He's taken what Gary Andersen started and elevated it to an even higher level, going 15-3 in Mountain West play. Interesting fact: Even though he grew up in Oklahoma, Wells was born in … Columbia, South Carolina.\n► Tom Herman: Though the hype around Herman may be a little too big given the fact he's spent all of five games as a head coach (and came into a ready-made winning situation at Houston), the former Ohio State offensive coordinator has an excellent future. Don't overlook this fact: Herman was responsible for recruiting the Atlanta area while he was at Ohio State. The next South Carolina coach will desperately need those connections.\n► Justin Fuente: Several insiders who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter told USA TODAY Sports that Eastman & Beaudine search firm has the inside track on handling the South Carolina opening. This is the firm that helped place Fuente at Memphis. Connect the dots.\n► Willie Fritz: He's 13-4 at Georgia Southern and is well on his way to running over the Sun Belt Conference again with a high-powered, innovative offense that has scored more than 40 points in four straight games.\n► Brent Venables: Not only would South Carolina hire one of the best defensive coaches in college football, it would strike a direct blow to in-state rival Clemson.\n► Kirby Smart: The Alabama defensive coordinator has come up for years in SEC circles when people speculate about the South Carolina job. It still makes sense.\n► Jeremy Pruitt: Georgia's defensive coordinator has lost some luster in recent weeks given the Bulldogs' performances, but he's destined to be a big-time head coach somewhere in the next five years.\n► Mark Dantonio: This would be a big swing, and only even remotely possible because Dantonio is a South Carolina alum. Still, he hasn't maintained a close connection with the school since then, and there's no reason to think he would leave Michigan State for this job.\n► Mark Stoops: Is Kentucky to South Carolina a big enough jump up? Maybe not, but it's a jump.\n► Bob Stoops: Hey, why not ask? He's BFFs with the HBC, and it may be time for a fresh start. Plus, the idea of Stoops in the SEC would be fascinating.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/sec/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:01:58.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
