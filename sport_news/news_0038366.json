Dottie Pepper to join CBS Sports golf roster in 2016 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Dottie Pepper has positioned herself to break new ground next April at Augusta National.\nCBS Sports, which has held TV rights to the Masters since 1956, announced Wednesday that Pepper will be a part of the network's 2016 golf announcing team.\nA native of Saratoga Springs, Pepper will be the first female on the CBS golf roster. Augusta National, host to the Masters, opened its doors to female members only three years ago.\n\"Those assignments haven't been made for anybody yet,\" Pepper said from her home in Saratoga Springs. \"It will be a different role, but I'll be doing (ESPN's) SportsCenter, as well, so that's not going to change.\"\nPepper, 50, is under contract to ESPN through 2017 and will continue in that capacity. With the network having sold its 2016 British Open rights to NBC on Monday, ESPN has only two live tournaments: the Latin America and Asia Pacific Amateurs.\nThe remainder of the 35 days that Pepper is contractually obligated to fulfill with ESPN will be SportsCenter appearances, including some at the Masters.\n\"I had to have a release from ESPN to even speak to CBS,\" she said. \"I did the deal myself. I did it without an agent. It was about getting the people together and understanding the people involved in it and what the expectations were, and how it was all going to work together. That's ultimately what had to happen.\n\"I was never asked to make a choice, which was phenomenal. The whole spirit was, how can we make this work together? It happened very simply in great spirit and very quickly.\"\nCBS Sports chairman Sean McManus handled negotiations with ESPN's John Wildhack , executive vice president of production and programming, and Mike McQuade , vice president of golf production.\n\"Dottie is one of the most respected and insightful analysts in golf,\" McManus said. \"She has played and covered the sport at its highest levels, and her reputation, contacts and relationships within the game are outstanding.\"\nPepper will be used primarily as a course reporter but also will do some analysis from the tower.\nShe essentially replaces David Feherty , who left CBS to join the NBC Sports Group . Feherty worked from the 15th-hole tower at the Masters, which does not allow on-course reporters.\n\"There's no replacing Feherty,\" Pepper said with a laugh. \"That's not possible. I'm not funny, but I'll work really hard. I'll try to relay about the game, the competition about the game, about golf course management, expectations, all of that, in the best way that I know. But you can't replace Feherty.\"\nHer CBS contract begins in 2016, and her first tournament will be the Farmers Insurance Open on Jan. 28-31 in San Diego.\n\"Once it became evident that we weren't going to do our deal with Feherty, Dottie was the first and only analyst we considered for the job,\" McManus told The Associated Press . \"Everyone we asked about Dottie, including the folks at ESPN, just raved about her work ethic.\"\npdougherty@timesunion.com • 518-454-5416 • @Pete_Dougherty", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790670/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790670/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790665/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790669/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790667/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790669/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790665/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790668/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790669/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790667/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790668/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/12/8790668/3/628x471.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:15:47.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
