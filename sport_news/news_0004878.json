He had surgery Sept. 30 on a fractured left orbital bone suffered in practice a day earlier. \n“Derrick, hopefully in another week, will be able to start getting active again, and then hopefully start practicing shortly thereafter,” Hoiberg said. \nRose was at the United Center for the Bulls’ preseason game against the New Orleans Pelicans Monday night, but likely wouldn’t be on the bench, Hoiberg said. \n“He’s still getting a little bit of blurred vision, so I feel it’s best for him to watch the game in the back,” Hoiberg said. “But I know he’s excited to be here and be with the guys in the locker room.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:14:19.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
