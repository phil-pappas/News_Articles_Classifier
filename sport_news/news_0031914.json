(Taylor Mahoney/Arizona Daily Sun via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT \n1. Saturday’s loss was Montana State’s fourth in a row away from Bobcat Stadium. The Bobcats’ last road win came Oct. 11, 2014, when they scored 77 points against UC Davis. Since then, MSU has lost at Cal Poly, Montana, Eastern Washington and Northern Arizona. \nIn two road games this year, the Bobcats are allowing averages of 52 points, 587 yards and 9.5 yards per play. \nEWU’s Jordan West and NAU’s Case Cookus have combined to throw for 654 yards and 10 touchdowns without a turnover, along with just nine incompletions. \nAs well as the two signal callers performed against the Bobcats, however, the ground production MSU has yielded is also troubling. \nEWU was averaging 2.4 yards per carry entering play Sept. 19, but rushed for 365 and 6.4 per. \nSimilarly, NAU entered Saturday averaging 2.7 per carry and then totaled 252 and 6 per. \nThrough four games, the Bobcats are allowing an average of 260 on the ground. \n2. Montana State had done an excellent job early in the season of avoiding penalties and turnovers, but both cropped up against the Lumberjacks. \nThe Bobcats turned the ball over just once in 244 plays over the first three games, and had one Saturday night, but it compounded the team’s problems. \nNAU had just marched 68 yards and used a Casey Jahn run to push its lead to 35-14 when Bobcats quarterback Dakota Prukop forced a deep post attempt to Justin Paige on the first play of the ensuing drive. Safety Eddie Horn was helping in coverage — though he was originally too shallow and had to recover — and made a leaping interception. The Lumberjacks turned around and covered 71 yards in four plays to score their second touchdown in a 1-minute, 17-second span. \nPrukop and running back Chad Newell also had trouble with a read-option exchange for the third time in as many games. The Lumberjacks’ Delvin Batiste was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct in the scrum for the loose ball — which Prukop ultimately won — so the impact was negated, but it’s still a disconcerting trend. \n“It’s just a late decision,” Prukop told reporters Tuesday. “The decision has to be made real quick and I think a couple times I’ve made the decision too late.” \nMSU was penalized eight times in its opener against Fort Lewis, but had committed seven for a total of 38 yards over the past two games. The Bobcats were flagged eight times against NAU, though, including defensive end Jessie Clark’s offsides that turned a first-quarter fourth and 4 into a first down. Cookus found Dejzon Walker for a 28-yard score and a 14-7 lead on the next play. \n3. Amidst a lot of ugly, the Bobcats had several notable performances on the offensive side of the ball. Senior Mitch Griebel, who entered play with 625 career receiving yards on 61 catches, had never scored a touchdown for Montana State. That changed in the fourth quarter when he hauled in a 13-yard corner route from Prukop. It was an important one, too, marking the first of thee scores over a 4:09 span in MSU’s long — and eventually futile — comeback attempt. \nJustin Paige hadn’t recorded a catch since Sept. 3 and had been targeted just once in the past two games, but came up big against the Lumberjacks. He got behind the defense multiple times, and recorded touchdowns of 64 and 40 yards on his only two receptions. The sophomore averaged more than 31 yards per catch in 2014 and rekindled that big-play ability Saturday. \nJunior running back Gunnar Brekke entered the game averaging 54.7 yards of offense per game, but eclipsed that easily on one play. He reeled in an 85-yard, fourth-quarter touchdown from Prukop and finished with 123 (101 receiving). The Helena native was also wide open for what would have been a touchdown on MSU’s first drive of the second half, but Prukop overthrew him. The Bobcats eventually turned the ball over on downs. \n4. Freshman cornerback Tre’von Strong made his first career start for the Bobcats. He’s the third player position coach Michael Rider and co-defensive coordinator Kane Ioane have plugged in opposite senior Bryson Keeton — senior Trace Timmer started the opener and sophomore Bryce Alley the previous two games. Strong and the rest of the secondary had a long day against the NAU passing attack. The Billings native didn’t turn his head to locate the ball on Cookus’ early touchdown pass to Walker, and was also beat for 43 yards in the second quarter. However, he was credited with a breakup against Elijah Marks in the third quarter and also appeared to knock a would-be 39-yard touchdown loose from Marks in the first. \nParker Gabriel can be reached at pgabriel@dailychronicle.com or 582-2690.
