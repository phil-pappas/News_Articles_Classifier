But the Oregon State defensive coordinator re-emerged minutes later to face a crowd of reporters, who began peppering him with questions about what went wrong on his side of the ball in the Beavers' 42-24 loss to Stanford.\nSitake touched on the mistakes on big plays, which helped the Cardinal find the end zone from 42, 49 and 65 yards away. Or the missed tackles, which contributed surrendering 325 rushing yards as the Beavers wore down physically for the second time in three weeks. Or some players resorting back to old habits, which resulted in improper technique.\nAnd when asked if he took anything positive from the game, Sitake came up with an answer that could be viewed as pessimistic spin.\n\"It exposed some guys on their deficiencies and stuff that we can work on,\" he said of the group featuring nine new starters in 2015.\nTuesday marked arguably the most visibly displeased Sitake has looked while publicly speaking about his defensive unit. And now in the midst of a bye week, it's time for the Beavers to reset before the bulk of the Pac-12 slate.\n\"I'm not down on our players,\" Sitake stressed. \"They're who we have, and they're capable of winning games for us. If anything, it allowed us to see what we need to work on to get better this week and sharpen up our stuff so we can be ready for the Pac-12.\n\"When I saw 'exposed,' it's more about them not doing things that we ask them to, and we can work on that.\"\nYet improvements start with the Beavers' overall scheme.\nSitake's ideal defense thrives on the ability to switch in and out of personnel groups, disguise looks before the snap and aggressively blitz from all positions. And the Beavers consistently lined up with four defensive linemen against Michigan's power running game, then occasionally threw out packages with seven linemen against Stanford.\nFriday night, Andersen called the latter look \"about as high-risk as I could ever think about being.\" Tuesday, Sitake agreed the coaches currently need to make the defense simpler, so the Beavers can play faster.\n\"I would love to just stand there and match pieces and play that game of chess and be able to put the right guys on the right people every time,\" Sitake said. \"But what you do is you sacrifice technique and fundamentals when you're trying to do all this scheming.\n\"I would love to scheme a lot more, but we are not good enough with our fundamentals and technique. So we have to find a balance there ... as soon as we can have a good foundation to build on, then we'll work on adding more scheme.\"\nThose fundamental issues have primarily popped up in the second half against the Wolverines and Cardinal, where a lack of depth against those physically powerful squads can lead to fatigue.\nThat, in turn, can lead to mental mistakes like not following the correct assignments. Or trying to strip the ball rather than wrap up for a form tackle. Or returning to habits taught by the previous coaching staff, which Sitake stresses aren't necessarily \"wrong\" by themselves but just not correct for the Beavers' new system.\n\"Overall we need more individuals to buy into what we're teaching,\" Sitake aid. \"It's different than what they've done in the past. What happens when things get tough, you're trying to get them to get out of what they've learned for the last three years ...\n\"If you don't work the technique we're teaching within our scheme, it's really not going to work well.\"\nPerhaps the good news for the Beavers is they won't face a team like Stanford or Michigan again until next season. By then, players will be a year stronger in the weight room and a year wiser in the playbook, with more youngsters ready to contribute.\nInstead, OSU's remaining schedule is littered with potent spread offenses, starting next Saturday's contest at Arizona. That's the system Sitake believes his defense is better equipped to face, where it can primarily utilize its 3-4 base scheme. It's what the Beavers practiced against every day during spring practice and fall camp.\nSo chalk up the Stanford game as a \"bad experience,\" Sitake said. He insists the offense scoring 24 points should have been enough to beat the Cardinal, and that his unit failed to finish the job.\nBut \"bad experience\" does not necessarily foreshadow a bad season.\n\"I'm not saying that we have to go find a new 11 (starters),\" Sitake said. \"We're gonna win with these guys and we're gonna stop people on defense with these guys ...\n\"I'm actually pleased that it happened this early, where we can find some things to get better (at) and work on\"\n-- Gina Mizell | @ginamizell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ginamizell"], "published": "2015-09-30T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:23:44.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
