You hate to make a habit of it, but maybe we can pull it off again.\" \nDavid Price will take the mound for the Blue Jays after his collapse in Game 2, when he tossed six scoreless innings and then surrendered five runs in the seventh inning. \nYordano Ventura will oppose him for Kansas City. He was only marginally better, allowing three runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings before watching the comeback win from the dugout. \n\"I'm very fortunate and happy that this game has landed on my turn, here in Kansas City, and with the opportunity to take this club to the World Series,\" Ventura said through catching coach Pedro Grifol, acting as a translator. \"I'll be ready for this game.\" \nThe Blue Jays promise they will be, too. \n\"I know what I'm capable of doing and I think everybody in this room knows what I'm capable of doing,\" Price said. \n\"I just kind of want to do it too bad. And it's long overdue for me to get a win as a starter in the playoffs, and I'll be ready to change that story [tonight].\" \nToronto lost the first two games against the Rangers at home, then won three straight with its season hanging in the balance. The first two were at Texas, and the last at Rogers Centre, but none of the victories was even close — all by at least three runs. \nThe Blue Jays lost the first two games in Kansas City, too. But in Game 3 in Toronto, the hosts overcame a 1-0 deficit and rolled to an 11-8 victory. \n\"We've been through a bunch of hurdles all year,\" Blue Jays outfielder Chris Colabello said. \n\"We were 7 1/2 games [back] at the deadline. ... We had to claw back from that. We were down two games back in the division series and we clawed back from that. I'll tell you what, we're going to leave everything we have out there.\" \nThey may have to do just that. While the Blue Jays have won four straight elimination games, the Royals are 6-2 in their past eight postseason games at Kauffman Stadium. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:57:07.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
