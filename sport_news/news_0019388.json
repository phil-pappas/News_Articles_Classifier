I really got the easiest job. So if anybody needs to be recognized, it needs to be the whole punt return team.” \nOn the season, Cox has returned seven punts for 119 yards. The 93-yard punt is the longest punt return in the SLC this season. \nDespite Cox saying he has the easiest job, he said catching punts is difficult. \n“People see it on TV and say ‘I could’ve caught that,’” he said. “Catching a punt is an art, just like returning kicks, and it’s a skill you really have to practice every day to hone your skills to be great at it.” \nCox doesn’t only return punts, as he has 72 receiving yards on 12 catches, which is third-most on the team. \nCox spent his freshman season with the Arkansas State University Red Wolves but transferred to UCA in the offseason. \nCox was a top receiver for Conway High School prior to graduating in 2014, so this year is a homecoming for Cox. \n“I just felt like [ASU] wasn’t a good fit for me, but coming home is always a good thing, so hopefully I can further solidify my spot here and help this team win,” he said. \nBecause he transferred from a Football Bowl Subdivision school to a Football Championship Subdivision school, he does not have to sit out this season. \nDespite the change, he said there weren’t really any adjustments that had to be made. \n“The thing for me, coming here was learning the plays and then playing fast,” he said. \nNow that Cox is back in Conway, he feels like he has more people around him than just the football team. \n“When you’re away from your family and friends back home, you really only have your football team,” he said. “Aside the brothers on the football team, I can see my real family every day. It’s really my backbone and that’s really my support when I came back home.” \nCox and the rest of the Bears will face the undefeated McNeese State University Cowboys at 6 p.m. Saturday at Estes Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:56:00.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
