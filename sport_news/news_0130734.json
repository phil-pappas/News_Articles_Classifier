Lehner was hurt in the second period of Buffalo's season-opening 3-1 loss to Ottawa on Thursday.\nHe was untouched while circling his own net and before suddenly going down in his crease.\nThe injury means the Sabres will proceed with backup Chad Johnson and minor-league call-up Nathan Lieuwen. Johnson had 27 saves in a 4-1 loss to Tampa Bay on Saturday.\nLehner was supposed to play a key role with the new-look Sabres this season. They traded a first-round draft pick to Ottawa to acquire the 24-year-old goalie and forward David Legwand in June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:47:16.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
