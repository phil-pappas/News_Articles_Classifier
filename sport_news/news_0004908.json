They want to win the MLS Supporters' Shield, given to the team finishing with the top regular-season record.\nDallas (17-10-6, 57 points) and the New York Red Bulls enter the final day of the season with identical records. With the Red Bulls holding the tiebreaker, FCD will probably need to beat San Jose on Sunday at Toyota Stadium to have a shot at securing the first Shield in franchise history. A draw might do the trick, but only if New York loses at Chicago, the last-place team in the Eastern Conference.\n\"It's something that needs to be done,\" Pareja said. \"That's what we work for. We still are proud of putting ourselves in that competition [the Champions League], which is not easy. But really, we need to get trophies. It's what we all want.\"\nBeating San Jose doesn't figure to be easy. At 13-12-8 (47 points), the Earthquakes are one point behind Seattle Sounders FC and Sporting Kansas City, the teams holding down the final two Western Conference playoff slots with one game left.\nAfter losing 2-1 on Aug. 8 in Houston, San Jose was 7-10-5 with a minus-6 goal differential. Since then, coach Dominic Kinnear and the Quakes are 6-2-3 with a plus-9 goal differential.\n\"It's going to be a tough game because they're trying to get three points for the playoffs and we need a win to get the Supporters' Shield,\" FCD midfielder Fabian Castillo of Colombia said via a translator. \"We're just going to try to win the game and see what happens between New York and Chicago.\"\nFCD captain Matt Hedges agrees that all he and his teammates can do is focus on their game, and not the Red Bulls-Fire matchup. Both kick off at 6 p.m.\n\"It's not really up to us,\" Hedges said. \"We have to go out and get three points, but that's what we try to do every game, and hopefully Chicago can get something done.\"\nCastillo sees the final regular-season game as serving another important purpose. FCD wants to fine-tune parts of its game before its playoff opener next Sunday.\n\"We're a really good team, not a great team right now, but we're working on it,\" Castillo said. \"There's a lot of ways we can improve, like ball-handling skills, but we're getting better at it. The more we play together, the better we're getting as a team.\"\nStephen Hunt is a Frisco-based freelance writer.\nOn Twitter:\n @dfwsportsguy93", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/dfwsportsguy93"], "published": "2015-10-25T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:21:27.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
