I teams. The Rams will play a 20-game regular season, with 11 of those games counting as official FCIAC contests. The league has been reduced to 12 teams this year, as Stamford and Westhill have merged into a co-op team. The Darien Blue Wave, which won state and FCIAC championships last winter, is on the slate twice for New Canaan. The two rivals will play in a non-conference match-up on Tues., Dec. 29, and play the official FCIAC game on Sat., Jan. 30. Both games will be played at the Darien Ice Rink. The Rams will also have two games against three other FCIAC foes: State and FCIAC runner-up Greenwich, Ridgefield, and St. Joseph. The non-conference schedule is daunting, starting with the Notre Dame-West Haven Green Knights in the season opener at 6 p.m., Mon., Dec. 21, at Bennett Rink in West Haven. Hamden, Notre Dame-Fairfield, and Xavier — twice — are also part of New Canaan’s schedule. The Rams’ first seven games are all against Div. I teams.
