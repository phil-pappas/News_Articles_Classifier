Posted: Friday, October 2, 2015 6:00 am Blue Devils defend their throne BY CHAD DARE cdare@dancomnews.com Commercial-News.com \nDANVILLE — In the history over the Vermilion Valley Conference, Bismarck-Henning has been the team on top of the pile. \nThe Blue Devils entered Thursday’s conference meet at Harrison Park with seven team titles, including four straight. \nBut it was the last time that the Blue Devils were on the course that proved to be the motivation. Bismarck-Henning avenged a loss to Oakwood in the Bismarck-Henning Invitational with a 14-stroke victory (326-340) to earn that fifth straight league title. \n“I think they were ready to go. They didn’t care for getting beat on Saturday,’’ Bismarck-Henning coach Terry French said. “It might have been a good thing for us \n“No one cares what you won yesterday, it’s what you do today.’’ \nBismarck-Henning sophomore Hunter Keith, who took second individually with a 5-over 76, said there wasn’t really any pressure on the Blue Devils. \n“If we just played the way that we are capable of playing, we knew that we had a pretty good chance to win this title,’’ he said. “We recuperated well from Saturday and came back strong today to get the victory.’’ \nKeith’s 76 was followed by a 6-over 77 from Skyler Mitchell, while Kade Smith (86) and Blake Douglass (87) rounded out the Blue Devils top four. \nOakwood junior Brandon Rowe claimed his first-ever conference title with a 3-over 74 to lead the Comets. While Trent Hicks (81), Lukas Hoshauer (87) and Cameron Wise (98) made up the top four for the Comets. \n“We have been off-and-on this year, but we have been playing pretty well lately,’’ Rowe said. “It would have been nice to win it as a team, but I think going forward, it won’t hurt us that much.’’ \nAs Keith pointed out, Bismarck-Henning earned its title with a balanced attack. \n“We played really well as a team,’’ he said. “We got a couple of good bounces at times, and it all worked out well at the end for us. \n“The conditions were a little tougher today (than Saturday) with the win, but our score was pretty much the same.’’ \nThat’s something that Bismarck-Henning coach Terry French has been stressing to his team all season. \n“Hopefully, my guy took it to heart about how every shot counts,’’ French said. “I told them are one of the most frustrating teams that I’ve ever had. And, I mean that in a kind way. \n“They have a lot of talent. They just haven’t always produced. Sometimes, they get down on themselves very quickly — instead of buckling down and digging in and finding a way to win.’’ \nFrench believes that a couple of his golfers did follow his advice of finding a way to get the job done, including Douglass, who had an 87 for the Blue Devils. \n“Blake started with a triple (bogey) on this first hole,’’ French said. “A lot of times, that can be a disaster, but he kept digging and finished with a good score. \n“That’s what can happen when you keep digging.’’ \nEven Rowe, who earned the conference medalist honors, had to find a way to survive a rough stretch on Thursday. \nThe Oakwood junior was 1-under after his first five holes with birdies on No. 3 and No. 5, but a double bogey on the par-4 seventh and a bogey on the par-4 eighth dropped Rowe to a 2-over 38 on the front nine. \n“I got a couple of bad lies and I just couldn’t make much from it,’’ he said. “I just tried to come out on the back nine, and get back into it.’’ \nRowe shot a 1-over 36 on the back nice to claim the individual title by two strokes over Keith. \n“I got second my freshman year,’’ said Rowe of the 2013 tournament. “It’s nice to finally be able to get the title. \n“I didn’t play very well last year and I just wanted to be better and get the victory this year.’’ \nIn the girls Vermilion Valley Conference tournament, Salt Fork’s Camaryn Todd earned her second straight title with a 91. Madison Katavich was second with a 104.
