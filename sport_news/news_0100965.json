His kick bounced off on-coming Cuban forward Maykel Alejandro Reyes Azcuy and into the net for a stunning goal. \nPanama did not score the equalizer until Josiel Alberto Nunez's goal in the 75th minute, helping it avoid a surprising upset as the country seeks its first ever Olympic bid. \nPanama plays its second of three group games Saturday against Canada.
