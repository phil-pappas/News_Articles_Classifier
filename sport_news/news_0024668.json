But there was a 20-year-old in the front row who hasn't found the spectator experience enjoyable.\n\"I'm not going to lie,\" Jazz point guard Danté Exum said, \"it's horrible.\"\nThe last time Exum played in a game was Aug. 4, in an arena in Ljubljana, Slovenia. It was an exhibition game, preparation for Olympic qualifying later in the summer, and the fifth overall pick in the 2014 draft was wearing the yellow and green of the Australian national team. Exum drove into the paint, stopped quickly as a defender closed him down and pushed off into the air.\n A moment later, he lay on the floor clutching his left knee.\n\"It felt like when I landed my foot kind of slipped under me a little bit,\" he said. \"And then I went to jump and push and that's when I felt the pop.\"\nAlmost immediately, Exum knew he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament.\n\"Everything runs through your mind. You think about the Jazz. What everyone's going to think?\" he said.\nExum's rookie campaign with the Jazz did not produce huge numbers. The point guard averaged a modest 4.8 points and 2.4 assists in 22 minutes per game. But Exum's size, speed and defensive contributions helped him win the starting job by season's end.\nBy July, Exum looked like a more complete and confident player. He scored 20 points, and had five assists and five rebounds in the first game of summer league before rolling his ankle near the end of the contest. He didn't play again in summer league, but that flash helped build buzz about what Exum might be able to do in the coming season.\nIt took one play in August to crush those hopes.\n\"It was tough,\" center Rudy Gobert said. \"He worked hard this offseason and he was ready for a big year.\"\nInstead he faces a year of watching from the sideline as he tries to work himself back from injury.\n\"It's tough,\" Exum said. \"But I keep trying to remind myself and think of it as a positive and trying to learn. The one thing everyone keeps saying is you're still young and all that. That's what I kind of try to come back to and look at it as a way to learn from a coach's perspective.\"\nHis teammates, like fellow Aussie Joe Ingles, have helped ease the pain.\n\"He's the Danté of old — just minus a few things in his knee,\" Ingles said this week. \"He knows what's ahead of him. He's working hard and everyone here will keep supporting him.\"\nExum said Friday he is pain free and able to walk without help, which he credits in large part to a stringent pre-hab regimen. Exum's torn ACL was diagnosed almost immediately, but his surgery wouldn't come for more than a month, as he went through a rigorous physical therapy, getting the swelling in his knee to subside while strengthening his quadricep and maintaing flexibility.\n\"As much as I hated it,\" Exum said. \"… it's helped me I think to be able walk sooner, get off the crutches and out of the brace just because of that.\"\nThe surgery was Sept. 3 in Los Angeles. Afterward, Exum said it was a \"no brainer\" to return to Salt Lake for his rehab, rather than stay in California or return home to Australia. Already, he said he's made progress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:12:34.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
