(AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps) \nMILWAUKEE (AP) — U.S. Olympian Gracie Gold doubled a planned triple flip but otherwise was smooth in her short program Friday, finishing second to Russia’s Evgenia Medvedeva going into Saturday’s free skate. \nU.S. pairs champions Alexa Scimeca and Christopher Knierim channeled Metallica en route to the short program lead. \nGold scored 65.39 points to world junior champion Medvedeva’s 70.92. \nGold, who trains in California under Frank Carroll, landed her opening triple lutz-triple toe loop combination and was cruising through her fun and sexy tango program when she popped the flip. \n“I just lost a little bit of my attack,” Gold said. “We were really working on coming out of the gate strong and I do clean shorts in practice all the time. I just think it was a slip-up. I feel really solid about the start to the Grand Prix and so far I’m right on track to hopefully do a killer long (program) tomorrow.” \nU.S. bronze medalist Karen Chen, making her Grand Prix Series debut, was in fourth place at 62.28 points. Sochi Olympics star Julia Lipnitskaia struggled and was fifth. \nSkate America is the kickoff event of the International Skating Union’s Grand Prix of Figure Skating Series. \nDressed in black leather and sporting a tough look, the Colorado Springs-based Scimeca and Knierim delivered a powerful program that included a soaring triple twist lift and a crisp throw triple flip. Their score of 69.69 points led the Chinese teams of Sui Wenjing and Han Cong Han (68.28) and Wang Xuehan and Wang Lei (64.95) heading into Saturday’s free skate at UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena. \nThe Russian team of Ksenia Stolbova and Fedor Klimov, the 2014 Olympic silver medalists, made several mistakes and sit fifth (63.41). \n“We’ve been working so hard in the mirror on expression and tension within the movements,” said Scimeca, who wore a long ponytail and purple lipstick. “It felt great to bring it today. I think we made everybody in the audience feel something, and that was the goal.” \nScimeca and Knierim stepped up the choreography and intensity of the program after receiving feedback from officials earlier in the season. \n“It was just about being stronger, more fierce in the performance,” Scimeca said. “One reason we chose this music is because of the lyrics (“Nothing Else Matters”). They mean a lot to us.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:06:32.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
