Coming out of Hunterdon Central High in New Jersey, he never envisioned the current state of the program, where the Owls are 5-0 heading into Saturday's 7:30 p.m. American Athletic Conference game at Lincoln Financial Field against Central Florida (0-6). \n\"I didn't have a plan when I came here,\" he said. \"I figured I was coming to Temple to play ball.\" \nAnd play ball is what he has done. \nIoannidis never redshirted, playing the final six games of his freshman season as a reserve. More coverage SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise \nThe 6-foot-4, 292-pound Ioannidis started seven games as a sophomore, including the final three. He has been a fixture ever since. Saturday Ioannidis is expected to make his 21st consecutive start. His 20th last week was among his best. \nAmong the strongest players on the team, Ioannidis recorded six tackles and 11/2 sacks, both season highs in last week's 49-10 win over Tulane. \nHe wasn't overly impressed with his performance and due to his team-first nature, never really worries about personal statistics. \n\"I care about winning, about being 1-0 every week and I care about the defense playing well,\" he said. \nThere has been a lot to care about so far this season. \nTemple is allowing 14.4 points per game, which is first in the AAC and 13th nationally. \nIoannidis is one of those selfless players who often takes on multiple blockers, freeing up gaps for his teammates. \n\"His job is to dominate inside,\" Temple coach Matt Rhule said of Ioannidis. \"Whether he gets tackles or not, doesn't matter.\" \nStill, he has contributed his share of big plays this year. In the opening 27-10 win over Penn State, he had four tackles, two tackles for loss and a sack. For the season he has 13 tackles, 31/2 tackles for loss, 21/2 sacks and one fumble recovery. \nMore than the statistics, the Owls have benefited from his no-nonsense approach, his work ethic and leadership. \n\"He is a leader and a tough guy,\" Rhule said. \"He holds people accountable, as well as himself.\" \nIoannidis is also among the smartest players, rarely out of position. In addition, he is on schedule to graduate in December, earning a degree in communications in 31/2 years. \nFor somebody who didn't have a plan, things have gone well for Ioannidis, who is among many Temple players considered NFL prospects. \nMost of all, Ioannidis is enjoying the winning this season. The Owls were 12-23 his first three seasons, although Temple was 6-6 last year. \n\"I didn't think any of this would happen,\" he said. \"I didn't expect such a great turnaround.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:34:13.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
