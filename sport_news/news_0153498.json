(AP) — Coach Steve Clifford is intrigued with what he's seen in training camp from guard Nicolas Batum and expects the seven-year NBA veteran to play a major role with the Charlotte Hornets this season.\nClifford anticipates that Batum's scoring output will increase noticeably, and expects him to be one of the team's top three scorers along with center Al Jefferson and point guard Kemba Walker.\n\"Why not? I know I can,\" Batum said with a simple shrug of the shoulders.\nBatum has often been the fourth option in Portland.\nThe Hornets acquired Batum in an offseason trade from the Trail Blazers for Gerald Henderson and 2014 first-round draft pick Noah Vonleh. He's scheduled to open the season at the No. 2 spot for Charlotte because Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be starting at small forward.\nClifford has been looking for a consistent third scorer who can shoot from the outside. Batum is a 36.3 percent career 3-point shooter, although he had down season in 2014-15.\nThey swung and missed last season with free agent signee Lance Stephenson, a bad fit who was jettisoned after just one season.\nJudging from practice, Clifford thinks Batum will fare better.\n\"For his career he has always been around 13 or 14 points per game, but I think he will get more play calls here,\" Clifford said. \"The big thing isn't necessarily the number but how efficient he is — and I think he will play very efficiently.\"\nBatum played in 481 games in seven seasons with the Trail Blazers, averaging 11.2 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.0 assists and shot 44.6 percent from the field.\nHe also brings added playoff experience having appeared in 34 postseason games for Portland and averaging 10.2 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists.\nBatum's numbers fell off slightly last season while he battled through injuries, but the 6-foot-7 Frenchman still managed to play 71 games and average 9.4 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.8 assists.\n\"He's a creator,\" Clifford said. \"To me he does all of the things you can't teach. He knows where the ball should go. He's a terrific passer who can play off the dribble. When you watch him play he already knows this guy can do this, this guy can do that. His feel for the game is just so good.\"\nThat comes from a lot of film study.\nOn the first day of practice, Batum walked into Clifford's office and asked him about a particular defensive concept. Clifford looked at him puzzled, knowing the team had yet to talk about it, let alone begin to install it in practice.\n\"I was like, 'Where did you see that?\" Clifford said. \"And he said, 'Oh, I was just going through the playbook.'\"\nBatum said he likes to be prepared.\nHe's spent two months watching tape of his teammates so he could get to know their tendencies.\nAnd he likes what he's seen.\nThe Hornets made the playoffs two seasons ago with a 43-39 record, but were left out of the postseason last season.\n\"I am so excited to play here,\" Batum said. \"I don't think people realize how good we can be.... I'm not saying we're going to win 55 games this year, but it's going to be different.\"\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
