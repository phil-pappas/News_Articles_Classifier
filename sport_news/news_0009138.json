A year after winning only one game and with a roster of only about 19 players, Houston County's expectations may have been low if you talk to the prep football pundits around the Midstate. \nBut Brandon Clark always had faith that if he could produce the roster numbers, and the injury bug stayed away, not only could he improve on that one-win season in 2014 but he could also make a run for the Class A playoffs. \nHouston County's Nolas Seay runs around the end against Stewart County during a game earlier this season.

We're mostly a senior and junior-led team and sometimes injuries come because you have freshmen and sophomores who are still learning how to develop high school football bodies in the weight room. But we've been lucky so far this season.\" \nClark spent last spring trying to bulk his roster and when the summer hit, he had more than 50 players on the team. Those players have stuck around and the injury bug hasn't decimated the Fighting Irish like in years past. \nSubsequently, Clark's Houston County team is in the thick of the Class A playoff chase as it plays host to Perry County at 7 p.m. Friday night in Erin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:42:53.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
