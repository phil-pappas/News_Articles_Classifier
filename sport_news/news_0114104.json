Austin had blockers in front of them and cut across the field and down the sidelines, outrunning the final Florida State defender at the 5 to score the winning points. \nNo. 1 Ohio State 49, Rutgers 7 \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. -- Making his first start of the season for top-ranked Ohio State, J.T. Barrett passed for 223 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 101 yards on 13 carries and two more touchdowns as the Buckeyes rolled past the Scarlet Knights. \nThe defending national champions have won 21 straight games, the longest active streak in the nation. \nOhio State's Ezekiel Elliott, the Big Ten's leading rusher, ran for 142 yards on 19 carries and two scores. \nNo. 2 Baylor 45, Iowa State 27 \nWACO, Texas -- The Bears raced to a big first-quarter lead despite a drenched playing field, then sloshed the rest of the way to a victory over the Cyclones. \nThe wet field and ball seemed to affect Baylor quarterback Seth Russell, who completed just 16 of 37 passes for 197 yards. But he threw two touchdown passes and ran for 64 yards and a score to help keep Baylor afloat and alive in the College Football Playoff race. \nRussell also suffered a fractured bone in his neck. Bears coach Art Briles told ESPN that he expects Russell to be out for a while but will know more after Russell sees the specialist. \nUSC 42, No. 3 Utah 24 \nLOS ANGELES -- Sparked by the defensive gems of linebacker Cameron Smith, the Trojans knocked the Utes from the unbeaten ranks. \nSmith intercepted three passes, including one that he brought back 54 yards for a touchdown. It was the first time a USC player had made three interceptions in a game since 1991 when safety Jason Oliver accomplished the feat. \nUSC's defense contained Devontae Booker, who entered the game ranked 10th nationally at 130.5 rushing yards per game. Booker rushed for just 62 yards on 14 carries. \nNo. 5 LSU 48, Western Kentucky 2 0 \nBATON ROUGE, La. -- Jamal Adams, a safety playing on a special teams unit that ranked 114th out of 128 in special teams efficiency, forced a fumble on a third-quarter kickoff to spark a frenzied stretch that saw the Tigers score three touchdowns in less than five minutes to put away the Hilltoppers. \nLSU quarterback Brandon Harris outdueled Hilltopper quarterback Brandon Doughty -- the nation's second leading passer -- with a career-high 286 yards and three touchdowns to three receivers. \nLeonard Fournette rushed for 150 yards, giving him nine straight 100-yard games and tying the LSU school record. \nNo. 6 Clemson 58, Miami 0 \nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- The Tigers jumped out early and led 42-0 at the half and recorded their biggest victory margin since an 82-24 rout of Wake Forest in 1981, their national championship season. \nThe Hurricanes fell to 4-3 in absorbing the worst defeat in the history of their program, which started in 1925. \nThe Tigers scored touchdowns on their first four possessions to take a 28-0 lead early in the second quarter and had 180 yards in total offense by that point. Deshaun Watson was 12-for-13 passing for 113 yards and a touchdown up to then and had a 63-yard run to set up Clemson's second score. \nNo. 7 Michigan State 52, Indians 26 \nEAST LANSING, Mich. -- Connor Cook threw for a career-high 398 yards and tied a career best with four touchdown passes to lead the Spartans. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:10:48.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
