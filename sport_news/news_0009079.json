This is where I am at, this is what I am excited about. \n\"We have got a lot of good people at this football club that understand the game.\" \nEvans has taken training at Thorp Arch on Monday and is set to be handed the job on a permanent basis. \nThe Scot did a fine job at the Millers, taking them from League Two to Championship safety in three seasons, but his imminent appointment still comes as a shock. \nRedfearn added: \"Good luck to him. He's had success wherever he has been.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:16:02.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
