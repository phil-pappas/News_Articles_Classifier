He brought a new system to the fold this season, he said this week. \n“I have a definite different system than what they’re used to,” Schmitz said. “We have different terminology and the way we do things.” \nHuron, ranked eighth out of nine teams in Class 11AA, is coming off a 20-14 win over Spearfish and showed flashes of progress, Schmitz said. \n“We didn’t fall apart when we got down, he said. “They put their heads down for a minute, and then bounced back. And that was a step in the right direction.” \nThe Tigers have been primarily a passing offense – Likness guessed it was around 60 percent of the time – and are led by junior quarterback Hyland Heinz. He has completed 97-of-171 (57 percent) of his passes for nine touchdowns with seven interceptions. \nSenior Trey Moeding has a team-high 21 catches for 239 yards and two touchdowns, while 6-foot-5 junior Tye Evers (10-265, 3 TD) and senior Greg Conrad (20-175, 2 TD) are also offensive weapons for the Tigers. \n“It will test our secondary, which will be good for us,” Likness said. “We’ve come a long way since our first game and if we can feel comfortable and make plays, that will really help us.” \nHuron does not have a rusher that has accumulated 100 yards this season, but the Tigers being able to move the chains to keep their defense off the field is a key, Schmitz said. \n“Offensively, we have to be able to move the ball on the ground and get first downs,” he said. “That’s been our problem, the lack of first downs.” \nThose would certainly be keys for Yankton as well, but the Bucks right now are working on their confidence, Likness said. \n“If we can do that, we’ll have turned the corner and maybe start heading in the right direction,” he said. \nFollow @jhoeck on Twitter \nYankton (3-3) at Huron (2-4) \n7 p.m., Huron \nLAST MEETING: Yankton opened the 2014 Class 11AA playoffs with a 43-21 victory over Huron on Oct. 30.
