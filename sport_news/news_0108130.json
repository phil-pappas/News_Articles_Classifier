I've played at the club since I was 10 and to sign for at least another three years is fantastic. \n\"I obviously want to play for Sussex and I feel the club is moving forward with a young squad. Three years definitely gives me that security to try and become a real senior player at this club, and to kick on next year and win games of cricket for Sussex.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:21:14.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
