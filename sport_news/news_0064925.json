Oliver Giroud skillfully converted Mesut Ozil's cross to put Arsenal ahead in the 36th minute before Laurent Koscielny doubled the lead two minutes later. Although Everton pulled one back through Ross Barkley's deflected shot, Arsenal proved too strong for the tourists eventually. Piling more misery on Everton, Gareth Barry was given an injury-time dismissal as he picked up a second yellow card for a foul on Kieran Gibbs. Arsene Wenger's side, however, would lose their numero uno position if Manchester City get a draw or more at Manchester United on Sunday.
