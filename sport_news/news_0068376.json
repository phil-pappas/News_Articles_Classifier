Instead, she finished with a par 72 and a second-place finish to winner Taylor BeDell of Warrensburg in the Missouri State High School Activities Association Class 2 Girls Golf Championship. \nBeDell and Acuff played together in the leaders group on the second day of the 36-hole state tournament. Acuff watched as BeDell missed an eagle putt and settled for birdie on the par 5 18th hole. An eagle from Acuff would have forced a playoff. \n“Taylor is a great player. When she made that birdie putt, I set up for my putt and I was like, ‘Oh gosh, this is the most important putt of my life,’” Acuff said. \nAcuff missed. Her second-place finish is still a stark improvement from her 15th place finish at the 2014 state tournament. \n“I’m happy with how I shot. I’m proud. There’s nothing I can say to complain about it,” Acuff said. \nKickapoo coach Angie Odom said Acuff showed other players from around the state how much she has improved in a year. \n“She has matured as a player a lot. Used to, if she had a bad hole or a bad shot, she couldn’t shake it off,” Odom said. “Now, I’ve seen her mature so much. She has a bad shot and she can play through that, and that’s a big deal.” \nAcuff was equally eager to show improvement and was pleased to be in a three-way tie for second place after the first of two rounds. It meant she would be in the leaders’ group with BeDell. \n“I did not think I was going to be in that position. It was nerve-racking, but I was ready,” Acuff said. “I knew I had gotten better and I wanted to show that I had gotten better, maybe to just make a statement.” \nBeDell shot a 1-under par 71 on the first day of the championship. Acuff trailed by three strokes, and Odom encouraged her to take more chances with tee and approach shots. \n“(Acuff) had to make something happen in order to make up some strokes, so she had to start playing a little bit more aggressively,” Odom said. “She really gave it a run today; I was really proud of her.” \nAcuff improved to an even-par 72 on the second day of the tournament, but BeDell held on with her final birdie and a round of 74. \nAcuff is a three-sport athlete who also plays basketball and soccer. She is on track to be a valedictorian of her senior class in 2016. After graduation, she aspires to play college golf. \n“I feel like out of all my three sports, I have the best chance of playing golf at a higher level,” Acuff said. “I’m more driven with it. Yes, I love the other sports, but I love golf a little more.” \nRogersville’s Standage second at Twin Hills \nJoplin hosted the Class 1 Girls Golf Championship at Twin Hills Country Club. Lyndsey Standage of Rogersville tried but could not overtake India Gaume of Pembroke Hill, who won with a combined scored of 150. \nStandage’s scores of 73 and 79 put her in second place with 152. \nThe top 15 finishers in the Class 2 and Class 1 state tournaments are awarded all-state honors. \nThree-time state qualifier Meredith Sharp of Greenwood fired rounds of 90 and 88 at Twin Hills for 25th place. Sharp enjoyed her best finish in three tries at the state tournament. \nSharp is a junior who has one more season of high school golf at Greenwood to try for all-state status. \nClass 2 state championship At Rivercut, Springfield (Par 72)Team standings 1.
