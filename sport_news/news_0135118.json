But the Pirates exploded for 18 points in the second quarter thanks to scoring drives of 53, 33 and 45 yards. \nGreenland 39, Marshall 18 \nMarshall^0^6^6^6^—^18 \nGreenland^7^18^7^7^—^39 \nFirst Quarter \nGreen — Rhodes 11 pass from Self (De-Faria kick), 7:40 \nSecond Quarter \nGreen — Sisemore 13 run (kick failed), 11:19 \nGreen — Glander 9 pass from Self (pass failed), 9:31 \nMarsh — Magness 59 run (kick failed), 8:01 \nGreen — Sisemore 2 run (pass failed), 1:23 \nThird Quarter \nGreen — Self 23 run (De-Faria kick), 10:04 \nMarsh — T.

Self was a model of efficiency through the air, completing 9 of 14 passes for 141 yards and three touchdowns. Self added a 23-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. \nDespite the victory, Greenland coach Lee Larkan said he wants to see a better effort from his team. \n\"You're always happy win you win,\" Larkan said. \"Marshall got after us and had a great scheme. But we played like we practiced; we've got to try to get better.\" \nGreenland has beaten opponents by an average of 27.3 points, and the Pirates hadn't allowed a score in 13 consecutive quarters. The streak ended in the second quarter when Marshall's Tyler Magness found a hole and raced 59 yards for a touchdown. \nMarshall scored twice in the second half. Bobcats quarterback Andrew Phillips connected with Trey Kelley for a 22-yard touchdown pass on fourth down. With time winding down in regulation, Kendrick Campbell barrelled into the end zone from the 2-yard line. \n\"I'm real proud of (ending Greenland's scoreless streak),\" Marshall coach Lee Sadler said. \"We only brought 17 guys tonight and we're banged up.\" \nWith the season winding down, Sadler said he hopes to build on the momentum from the Bobcats' solid outing against Greenland. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:00:45.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
