The literal trophy at stake is the Dakota Marker - but the purse is much larger. \n\"Well when you get the Marker back they're a lot of things that come with that. You beat the number two team in America, you get the bragging rights in the Dakotas here. It's a great rivalry game and we're probably going to set a stadium record,\" Jackrabbit Head coach John Stiegelmeier said. \nIn last Saturday's win over Robert Morris, Jackrabbit QB Zach Lujan threw for 395 yards and three touchdowns. The junior is the reigning conference player of the week, and leads the valley in passing yards. \n\"Well Zach has done a great job with all the stuff that we have put on his shoulders. High-five him for his great performance - I don't think any of us knew he threw for that many yards in that football game, but he takes what you give him, and he'll never say whoa too much or it's somebody else's fault. He is a great competitor,\" Stiegelmeier said. \nLujan's counterpart will be Bison all-conference signal-caller Carson Wentz. The senior is a dual-threat QB, and led NDSU to their fourth straight FCS title in 2014. \n\"He is a complete quarterback - at our level - at the college level. I mean he is a drop-back guy, but he can run, he is a physical guy - he is the biggest running back they have on the football team. He is their quarterback and they design things for him to run, Stiegelmeier said. \nThe rivalry dates back more than 100 years, and with the schools separated by less than 200 miles, the teams are more than familiar with each other. \n\"Talk about North Dakota State and we know a lot about them and they know a lot about us. They are great coaches, they have a really good program, they have unbelievable support - we're good coaches and we have a really good program and we're going to have great support so it's going to be a fun night. If this is FBS, it's prime time TV so be here and enjoy the game,\" Stiegelmeier said. \nKick-off is set for 6 p.m. Saturday, at Coughlin-Alumni Stadium in Brookings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:20:38.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
