They had to to beat a really strong team. \n\"We're ecstatic to get off this start and hopefully (we can) keep the pedal down.\" \nThe Cup continues on Friday with five fourball matches, and with a significant deficit to overcome and history against them, the International team know they have their work cut out. \nInternational team captain Nick Price said: \" It was a tough day, the US team played really well. A couple of our pairings struggled, but it's a live and learn thing when you've got a new fresh team like we have. \n\"We've got 25 points left, we can't get down now, we've got a lot of golf (to play). We can turn it around tomorrow just as quickly as they did today, so I've got to talk them now and say 'keep your chins up'.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:51.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
