The New Orleans native is averaging 8.6 yards per rush. This week's opponent, Eastern Michigan (1-3), is dead-last in rushing defense. Couple that with the fact LSU is a 44.5-point favorite in this contest (as of Wednesday night) and the Tigers should win handily. \nHead coach Les Miles doesn't necessarily agree with that take. In fact, he was very complementary when speaking about the Eagles. \n\"If you watch the players, their players can play. The offense is averaging over 400 yards,\" said Miles. \nThe Eagles can definitely put up points. They've scored less than 34 points only once during the first four games of the season. Coming out of the MAC, Miles also appreciates the football hailing from his native midwest region. \n\"I have a lot of respect for the MAC,\" said Miles. \"If you saw what Toledo did, I'm guessing the MAC has a lot of respect. I'm not going any further than recognizing it's a quality league, quality football and we've got to play well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:28:58.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
