With a win, FSU will also tie the ACC record for most consecutive in-conference wins at 29, set by the Seminoles in 1992-95. Star running back Dalvin Cook, quarterback Everett Golson and FSU’s offense has yet to turn the ball over this season. FSU’s defense, which has allowed only one rushing touchdown, will look to slow GT quarterback Justin Thomas and the Yellow Jackets’ triple-option offensive attack. FSU RB Mario Pender begins rehab from collapsed lung \nBest case scenario: FSU’s offense rolls over Georgia Tech early, allowing Cook to rest his hamstring for the final stretch of the season. The Yellow Jackets have lost to Notre Dame, Duke, North Carolina, Clemson and Pittsburgh by an average of 9.4 points per game. Each of those teams combine for a 27-4 record as well. But it’ll be hard for a team dealing with that much adversity this season to be motivated playing from behind against the Seminoles. Get in and out of Atlanta early. FSU's Rod Johnson, offensive line have no plans on playing timid anymore \nWorst case scenario: A loss to a five-loss team is an obvious answer here. But if Cook’s hamstring tightens up during a long run, it could become more of a lingering concern than it already is for the Seminoles. Cook is in the Heisman race with LSU’s Leonard Fournette and TCU’s Trevone Boykin, among others. And while the storied award is not necessarily his focus, his production is why FSU is undefeated so far this season. Cook leads the team with 11 total touchdowns. FSU's Nile Lawrence-Stample emerging in final season with Seminoles \nFinal score and why? FSU 31, Georgia Tech 17. Thomas and the Yellow Jackets will find their way into the end zone, but the Seminoles will be much stronger. This is the last road game before the Clemson game on Nov. 7. It’s time for this FSU team to rectify their slow starts and poor performances on the road and turn the corner in 2015.
