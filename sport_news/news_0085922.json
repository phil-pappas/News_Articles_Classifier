Some political observers believe Vice President Joe Biden is holding the Democratic presidential race hostage while he decides if he'll seek the nomination.\n\"Generally speaking, candidates who enter races late don't do as well in the long term,\" said Matthew Dickinson, professor of political science at Middlebury College.\nLate entries to the race are nothing new, but few have sustained success.\nIn 2003, Gen. Wesley Clark entered the race in September, he peaked shortly after and slowly lost support in the subsequent months.\nIn 2008, Sen. Fred Thompson was a September entry and his support slowly withered away.\nAnd in 2012, Gov. Rick Perry took the lead in some polls within three weeks of entering. Gaffes and media vetting derailed his campaign that quickly collapsed.\n\"If these guys were that good, they would have run in the beginning. A lot of them jump in late because the presumptive front-runner seems to be faltering,\" said Dickinson.\nDickinson believes Biden sees a political opportunity with presumptive Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton mired in controversy.\n\"The conventional wisdom says he's an establishment candidate, so he would hurt Hillary more,\" said Dickinson.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders leads Clinton in New Hampshire and has closed the gap in Iowa, but Dickinson believes if Biden jumps in he'd drain Sanders' momentum.\n\"In races that Sanders is behind, he doesn't want to lose any support. So Biden is going to hurt him even if he hurts Clinton more,\" said Dickinson. \"Even if he's not doing well in the polling, Biden is going to suck up a lot of the media coverage.\"\nIn early November, Biden faces deadlines to get on the ballot in several early voting states, leading many to believe a decision from Biden is imminent.\nAccording to Real Clear Politics, which averages several national polls, Biden currently has 18 percent support, behind Sanders at 25 percent and Clinton leading with 41 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:15:30.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
