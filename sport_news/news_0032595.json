A&M (4-0, 1-0 SEC) remained undefeated and beat Arkansas for the fourth straight time. The Hogs (1-3, 0-1) couldn't close out their chance to rebound from losses to Toledo and Texas Tech in a major way and lost their third straight.\n\"I thought the look in their eye in the fourth quarter and in overtime was one of confidence,\" A&M coach Kevin Sumlin said of the Aggies, \"and I hadn't seen that in a while in this team.\"\nA&M quarterback Kyle Allen found freshman Christian Kirk for a 20-yard touchdown pass on the second play of overtime. Why not Kirk? He had eight catches for 173 yards, two touchdowns and 255 all-purpose yards.\nTaylor Bertolet made the extra point -- no given after he'd missed a 38-yard field goal attempt just wide right at the end of regulation that would've won it for the Aggies.\nThe Aggies had the chance because sophomore defensive end Myles Garrett, playing in his hometown, finally broke through the Hogs' beefy offensive line to sack Brandon Allen late in the fourth quarter, forcing a fumble. Linebacker A.J. Hilliard recovered for A&M at Arkansas' 41. A&M needed the stop because Arkansas had been having its way with the Aggies for much of the second half, moving the ball and dominating overall time of possession (39:28 to 20:32).\nA&M trailed 21-13 with 4:11 left in regulation before A&M's offense finally clicked. Allen connected with Josh Reynolds for 63 yards to set up Tra Carson's 2-yard scoring run. A&M benefited from a pass interference penalty on the drive, one of 11 costly Arkansas penalties for 93 yards. Allen connected again with Reynolds (three catches, 106 yards) for the two-point conversion to tie the score.\nBefore that breakthrough, Arkansas had been in control, scoring 14 straight to take the lead after trailing 13-7 early in the third quarter.\nArkansas rushed 42 times for 232 yards, 140 in the second half. Alex Collins rushed for 151 yards and a touchdown, and Brandon Allen went 20 of 25 for 225 yards and a TD, though he lost the fumble and threw an interception in the first half.\nA&M's Kyle Allen went 21 of 28 for a career-high 358 yards and two touchdowns, but the Aggies had trouble inside the 20-yard line. They twice settled for field goals, particularly costly when A&M only had the chance to run 48 plays the entire game.\n\"I knew early it was going to come back to haunt us, if not lose the game for us,\" Kyle Allen said. \"It's just hard in these types of games where they just hold the ball, and you've really got to take advantage of every opportunity.\nA&M converted just two of nine third downs.\nThe Aggies rushed for only 65 yards, 27 of which came from backup quarterback Kyler Murray, who twice entered the game in the second half and tried to spark A&M with his legs.\n\"He's a talent,\" Sumlin said. \"He's a different speed, a different pitch for the defense, and you can see that.\"\nBut it was ultimately Allen's composure and an array of big playmakers that allowed A&M to escape still undefeated.\n\"What a game, huh?\" Sumlin said. \"We had to get some breaks at the end. But you know how this game is, you make your own breaks. ... This is the kind of thing you don't want to go through as a coach. But when you come out on the winning side, you're glad it happened. And there's some real lessons that can be learned from tonight ... some things, obviously, we've got to shore up.\n\"But there's positives, and we're 1-0 in the SEC.\"\nFollow Kate Hairopoulos on Twitter at @khairopoulos .\nNo. 14 Texas A&M 28, Arkansas 21\nFull coverage Visit the Texas A&M page\nHairopoulos: Instant replay ... like in 2014, Aggies rally, top Arkansas in OT 28-21\nDeja blue: Arkansas' Bielema sees losing trend continue with another OT loss to A&M\nTexas A&M quick hits: Aggies post first sack vs. Arkansas this season; Razorbacks hog the ball\nFive thoughts: Red zone struggles for A&M, but freshman WR Kirk continues to impress\nPhotos: Hugs for Reveille; lots of tailgate action before Aggies rally to top Arkansas 28-21 in OT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/hairopoulos-instant-replay-like-2014-aggies-rally-top-arkansas-ot-28-21", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/deja-blue-arkansas-bielema-sees-losing-trend-continue-another-ot-loss", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/09/26/photos-hugs-reveille-lots-tailgate-action-aggies-rally-top-arkansas-28-21-ot", "http://twitter.com/khairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/texas-quick-hits-aggies-post-first-sack-vs-arkansas-season-razorbacks-hog-ball", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/five-thoughts-14-texas-comes-behind-defeat-arkansas-razorbacks-28-21-overtime"], "published": "2015-09-27T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:39:52.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
