Shane Keyser skeyser@kcstar.com The Royals’ Alex Gordon walked back to the dugout after striking out and stranding a runner at second base in the sixth inning during Sunday’s American League Division Series game against the Astros at Minute Maid Park in Houston. JOHN SLEEZER jsleezer@kcstar.com 1 of 3 Order Reprint of this Story HOUSTON \nThe uproar rose to a din with each pitch, as the volume at Minute Maid Park swelled thanks to the voices of fans starved by a decade without playoff baseball and the hollow thunk of inflatable noisemakers. This is October: Our best versus your best, and in the seventh inning of a 4-2 loss in Game 3 of the American League Division Series, Royals All-Star Lorenzo Cain stared out 60 feet and six inches away from Astros All-Star Dallas Keuchel. \nAs the collective backs of the Royals approached a wall, Cain represented the tying run. He had launched the lone salvo marring Keuchel’s ledger, a solo shot three innings prior. Now the Royals required Cain to break through, to erase the pattern of failure with runners in scoring position. A man stood on third base as Keuchel prepared to throw his 124th pitch of the day. \nKeuchel rocked and fired a 90-mph fastball destined for the outer reaches of the strike zone, away from where Cain might hurt him. Cain flailed and missed. He smacked his bat with his fist. The pattern held — the best of the Royals, stars such as Eric Hosmer, Alex Gordon and Salvador Perez, could not trump Keuchel, the ace of Houston’s rotation. \nWith the loss, one of the best Royals teams in franchise history moves to the brink of elimination. Yordano Ventura will start Game 4 on Monday afternoon. A victory will send this series back to Kansas City. A loss will usher in the winter, far earlier than general manager Dayton Moore and manager Ned Yost had hoped. \nAfter four sterling innings, Edinson Volquez stumbled in the fifth and the sixth. He coughed up a one-run lead, a thin margin to be sure, but perhaps the best expected against a stalwart southpaw like Keuchel. Astros veteran Jason Castro cracked a go-ahead, two-run single in the fifth and injured outfielder Carlos Gomez ambushed him for a RBI knock in the sixth. \nDanny Duffy yielded a solo blast to Chris Carter in the seventh. Keuchel would not depart until after the seventh. He set a season-high pitch count. He scattered five hits and stranded eight runners. Hosmer, Gordon and Perez combined to go 0-for-8 against him. \nThe Astros outfitted their park for maximum volume. Despite clear skies and temperatures in the 80s, the roof was sealed. The team distributed Thunderstix to fans before the game to manufacture noise. \nTheir guests did not seem to mind. One Kansas City coach mentioned the relentless stirring at Camden Yards during the 2014 American League Championship Series. The Royals swept two games there and silenced the crowd. \n“I like loud,” manager Ned Yost said before the game. “That doesn’t bother me. I like loud.” \nThe setting suited Keuchel. He finished the regular season with a 15-0 record and a 1.46 ERA at home. Kansas City avoided him for the first two games because the Astros needed Keuchel to pitch in the Wild Card Game. Keuchel blanked the Yankees for six innings and shepherded his team into the next round. \nKeuchel excels at producing groundballs via soft contact. The Royals did not lift a ball into the air until the third inning, when Alcides Escobar flied out to center. \nCain would become the next Royal to hit a flyball. This one would not fall into an Astros glove. He led off the fourth with a 10-pitch at-bat, fouling off five in a row. He spoiled changeups away and fastballs on the hands. At last, Keuchel hung a slider. Cain did not miss. \nThe blast soared over the Crawford Boxes in left field and cleared the train tracks high above the field. The baseball disappeared from sight. Cain clapped his hands, just once, as he touched home plate. \n“Let’s go!” he shouted as he slapped hands with Salvador Perez outside the dugout. “Let’s go!” \nVolquez kept the one-run advantage secure. His last playoff outing occurred in the National League Wild Card Game last fall, when the Giants ambushed him and eliminated the Pirates. Volquez sought to erase that memory on Sunday. \nHe operated at the height of his powers, mixing a 95-mph fastball with a deceptive changeup and a hammer curve. His defense aided him. Houston did not collect a hit until Chris Carter hit a liner off the left-field wall. Carter hesitated as he rounded first base, then tried to reach second. Alex Gordon gunned him down. \nThrough the first four innings, Volquez only experienced difficulties with outfielder Colby Rasmus. Volquez walked him twice, perhaps in deference to Rasmus’ torrid hitting earlier this week at Kauffman Stadium. Otherwise, Volquez recorded six strikeouts, baffling credible foes like Jose Altuve, George Springer and Carlos Correa. \nHeading into the fifth, no Astro had reached second base. That changed soon after Volquez issued a one-out walk to Luis Valbuena. Up came Carter. He ripped a first-pitch fastball into the left-field corner and sprinted for a double. Valbuena held at third. \nVolquez had struck out Castro with a curveball at the thighs in the third inning. Castro stared at the ball as it dipped into the strike zone. This time, Volquez tried a changeup in a similar spot. Castro rolled a single back up the middle to give Houston the lead. \nThe Astros padded the advantage in the next frame. Springer unloaded on the first pitch of the inning, a curveball down the middle. Cain sprinted to his right, trying to flag down the ball. He reached it with his glove, but could not hang on. Springer braked at second with a double. \nCorrea advanced Springer to third. The Royals elected to intentionally walk Rasmus. After Gattis struck out, Yost allowed Volquez to face Gomez. The outfielder was nursing an intercostal strain, and his swings earlier in the game looked agonizing. Yet he still lined a first-pitch single into center. \nThe ball landed near Cain’s feet. He was hamstrung by the ball’s flight, unable to charge for a dive, unable to stop Houston’s relentless rush. As the decibel level skyrocketed once more, the best of the Royals could not stop the best of the Astros. \nAlex Gordon hit a solo home run off Astros closer Luke Gregerson to lead off the ninth. After Alex Rios followed with a fly out to center field, Alcides Escobar hit a bloop single to left field. Escobar was out at second after Ben Zobrist grounded into a force out. Zobrist avoided the double play by beating the relay to first. Lorenzo Cain struck out, ending the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:56:53.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
