(Photo: File photo) \nThe basketball questions are awfully heavy for the first week of October and a fan base following a top-5 football team, but we'll leave those for last. First, let's psychoanalyze Mark Dantonio's Spartans! \n* So at the risk of sounding spoiled and ungrateful for a 5-0 start, what is wrong with MSU? Not so much with injuries, but I just don't recognize this team. The Spartans that won 24 of 27 games (the past two years) had a certain edge to them. They played with an attitude and swagger. Fierce. Determined. Intense. Angry. All adjectives for MSU the last couple of years that described a team that was determined to pummel the other team into submission, and to step on the throat mercilessly when the time came. An article I read a few days ago stated that the players know they must match the opponents' intensity. That was simply unthinkable for prior teams as no team matched the rage and intensity of the Spartans. It was our identity and a very large source of pride in Spartan nation. Now I do see a team in Michigan that embodies that mentality, but it's looking more and more like the team 90 minutes to the south. Please tell me that the Spartans are not getting fat and happy like some other team was a few years ago. Where is the hunger? Where are the Michigan State Spartans? \nDennis \nInteresting take, Dennis. With all the talk of those injuries and of various players struggling, there really hasn't been much talk of an overall lack of fire. I can't say that has jumped out at me, but the Spartans do seem to be prone to losing their edge. It happened in the second half at Western Michigan. It happened after they were up 35-7 on Air Force. And I suppose it happened against Purdue as well, though I still think the offensive line situation and some second-half weirdness (fumbled punt, etc.) were bigger factors. I also think all the traits you described apply to a team with great confidence. And I don't think this team has anything close to great confidence at this point. Don't forget, though, that the first three of those 24 wins you mentioned were anything but merciless throat stompings. Early returns on MSU's 2013 Rose Bowl championship team suggested another Buffalo Wild Wings kind of season, a feeble offense betraying its defense. Then that team caught fire. Mark Dantonio is searching for a similar spark with this one. \n* It is very comfortable in my armchair. Not rainy, not cold, but comfortable. The Spartans are undefeated, ranked as high as they've been in years, yet a perfect record is just not perfect enough! I am more than concerned about the second-half performance of the Spartan offense this year. We've really stalled out in the second half of most games, and when we really could use a few first downs to kill the clock and seal the victory, we're just not executing. In your mind, has \"Bollman Warner Overdrive\" now become \"Bollman Warner Sunday Drive\"? \nDon from Rockford \nZing, Don! Just one more example of our readers out-punning me â€“ such as the Connor-formist response to Connor-trarian. \"Bollman Warner Sunday Drive.\" Outstanding. I've been meaning to print up some BWO T-shirts, so maybe when things start going wrong in the stands, the thousands of fans in their BWO shirts can flip them around to display a BWSD in protest. Maybe circled in red with a line through it, Ghostbusters style. I'll split the proceeds with you. \nAs for your question, I think in two cases, against Air Force and Purdue, there was a \"Let's get the (heck) out of here\" feeling for MSU coaches. That's not to brush over everything that happened. Some play calls and execution didn't get it done. And especially against Purdue, that nearly cost the Spartans. Rather than rely on the defense to get a high-pressure stop Saturday, I think MSU should have relied more on Connor Cook to eliminate that as a necessity. MSU actually turned it on in the fourth quarter against Central Michigan, of course, and there were some disappointing late series vs. Western Michigan and Oregon. I'll be interested to see how much MSU benefits from getting its full offensive line back for the first time since early in the Oregon game (whenever that happens). \n* If I were to compare MSU's game against the Boilermakers to an Indy 500 race, it appears to me that MSU \"took their foot off the gas\" in the second half. In a 500-mile race, you can't take your foot off the gas and try to coast to a win. Do you think that -- based on the play calling by the offensive coordinators -- MSU took its foot of the gas in the second half of this game? I, for one, would like to see a backup quarterback get some playing time. To me, if you have a 21-point lead in the first half, why not come out and put 14 points on your opponent in the second half and then see what your second string QB can do? Did MSU's offense just falter, of was it just poor play calling by the coordinators? Thanks for your thoughts. \nDan \nSimilar question here from Dan, mostly addressed previously. But you're not the only person I've heard from who asked why MSU didn't play its backup quarterbacks vs. Purdue. And to that I say: MSU almost lost while playing its starting quarterback! It's a major disappointment that the Spartans have been able to get exactly zero experience for their backups through five games this season. But until this team figures out how to play well for a full game, it can't even think about messing around like that. \nHere's some displaced anger, courtesy of Shawn Windsor's column that mentioned that Michigan looks better than MSU at this point (which is true), while MSU has the higher ceiling (also true): \n* MSU was good in first half and less so in the second. U-M was just IMPRESSIVE, right? Did anybody notice Michigan in the first half at Maryland? It was 6-0, right? I watched it -- did any sportswriters? U-M was PATHETIC and looked inept in every respect -- Maryland was just worse! So U-M is GREAT, and MSU can't finish! Posh, I say, and more's the pity. Sportswriters lack any perspective and don't perceive what they are covering. Please watch and report on what HAPPENS, instead of trying to make meaning in such ham-handed and inexplicable fashion. \nPatrick of Davis, CA \nWell, Patrick sounds ready for MSU-Michigan week. I can't say I saw the Michigan game, as I was covering the MSU game. I know Shawn watches all he can watch. And while it sounds like U-M struggled on offense for a good chunk of that game against a bad defense, U-M's defense has been good or better all season. Not all good competition, but I'd say the defensive performances against the two teams from Utah were impressive. Luckily, we're less than two weeks from these teams actually playing each other, and then all the comparisons and reactions can just go away. The transitive football can take a rest. We'll see for ourselves. \n* I am absolutely devastated for Dennis Finley, his injury was gut-wrenching. You've already written on Dennis's response and how Dantonio says Dennis is handling this situation \"strong.\" What we saw as he left the field was encouraging. His reality may be more somber. \nLet's imagine for a minute that his football career is over, for me this is not a stretch. What mechanisms are in place to support our brother in arms? As a fan, I feel if not culpable, at least complicit. I believe in competition and I don't believe you can live a life without risk. That said, I would trade any number of recent MSU accomplishments (Rose Bowl included) and what they meant to my family of alums for the future of one young lineman who has got a long road to recovery. When I consider Dennis having to support his 300-pound frame on a surgically reconstructed lower leg for the next 50-60 years, I want to know more about the net design that catches him. There are too many \"cautionary\" tales about athletes out there. \nI'm not counting out a return to the field, but at this point that seems a secondary concern. Can fans have it both ways, show up a cheer on Saturday and assume that things will be good for the athletes when they move on? How should/can we put our intentions/actions where are mouths are? \nMatty Lad in Grand Rapids \nWow, Matty Lad, very thoughtful of you. It's way too often that these young people are deemed and discussed as little more than disposable pieces on an imaginary chessboard that serves to enable supporters of one college to drunkenly crow at supporters of a different college. OK, maybe that's extreme. I'm not trying to go all George Will on you. Football's a great game and the players get a pretty good deal. But my, it is brutal at times. The good news for Finley is that players actually come back from that injury quite frequently. As long as there are no complications with his rehab, he should be able to play next season. And if things don't work out physically for him, he can be medically disqualified and remain on scholarship and get his degree. As long as college football players at this level are willing to work, they'll be rewarded. \nAnd now for some basketball, starting with two about the potential fifth piece to what is already Tom Izzo's best recruiting class. \n* Following news of Miles Bridges' commitment, the attention has turned toward Josh Jackson (though it seems we will all be waiting quite a while before his decision comes). Is there anything to read into the fact that this is even being discussed at all? It seems that unless a player makes a decision to leave the program, either for the draft or to another school, this is all just wishful thinking (and I don't think it's right to \"wish\" a player to transfer). It doesn't seem like there is any point in speculating about either of these happening before the season has even started. But it seems strange that Izzo is still recruiting him. Is this more likely just a contingency plan, or is it possible Izzo knows something the rest of us don't? Would a contingency plan even get this much attention? News that Jackson considers MSU one of his favorites is also interesting. Why would he even have MSU on his list if an opening on the roster isn't a certainty? Long story short, looking for reasons to continue hope. \nKevin in New York \n*In what seems to be a never-ending stratagem to distract myself from my nerves surrounding MSU football as the injuries pile up, I have a quick question about MSU basketball. Izzo is killing it for the 2016 class and it sounds like Josh Jackson is really looking at MSU as well. And obviously we don't currently have a scholarship for him other than if someone leaves early. In my humble opinion it would seem that Alvin Ellis is the most likely to depart. I have heard many people talk of Eron Harris leaving early for the NBA but with Ellis' diminished role and his stay in Izzo's doghouse I feel like he is about a quarter-step from booking a ticket on the Heel-Toe Express out of East Lansing. I mean, other than the chance to ride the pine on a title contender, what is his motivation to stay if he really wants to see significant minutes or at the very least a significant role? \nSeth in Washington, D.C. \nThe Josh Jackson/MSU scholarship situation question is approaching \"What time does MSU's NCAA tournament game start?\" territory at this point. So let's deal with that here and then move on, realizing nothing will change or be determined any time soon. First of all, Kevin, I appreciate the sentiment about not wanting to speculate or \"wish\" a player to transfer. As for why Izzo would still recruit Josh Jackson? I don't think any coach in his right mind would stop recruiting a talent of that caliber just because there's no clear scholarship opening. They happen unexpectedly all the time. People transfer. People leave early for the NBA. People get hurt. MSU's 2016 early-entry possibilities would be Eron Harris and Deyonta Davis, though I'd be surprised by the first and shocked by the second. But we'll have to watch them play this season and see what happens. And for all we know, Ellis will work his way out of the doghouse and into an essential role as a junior. He would seem to be a transfer candidate, but I thought so after last season and he stayed. At this point it's all speculation and no answers on any of it are coming any time soon. But if you're Tom Izzo, you continue recruiting Josh Jackson. There's no question about that. \n* With Matt Costello being voted a captain, I'm inclined to read between the lines and see this as a sign of growth for a talented but inconsistent player who has been labeled as somewhat immature at times in his career. Am I reading too much into this? \nC.E. in Grand Haven \nI think it's big for Costello, C.E., and potentially big for MSU. I always thought Costello had captain potential, and I still remember Derrick Nix as a senior declaring that Costello (then a freshman and his roommate on the road) would some day command the Spartans. It's a support role as a senior, and this is Denzel Valentine's team with tremendous natural leadership from Tum Tum Nairn. But the fact that MSU players voted Costello a captain probably says something about what he showed in the offseason. He was already a very popular guy in the locker room, impossible not to like, but I'm guessing this means he's elevated his game and/or vocal presence.
