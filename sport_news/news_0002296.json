If the Cardinals won, Great America would rename its Raging Bull coaster to \"Raging Cardinals\" during Fright Fest, along with shipping Chicago-style deep-dish pizza and Old Style beer down Interstate 55.\nAlong with the American Thunder/Cubs Thunder switch, a Cubs victory would see Maull's BBQ sauce with pork steaks and St. Louis toasted ravioli coming north. Apparently feeling confident that the Cardinals would advance to a fifth consecutive appearance in the National League Championship Series, the Six Flags St. Louis marquee featured a taunt as the Division Series got underway on Oct. 9: \"No worries, it's just the Cubs.\"\nWith the result now in the record books and the temporary name change in place, Enrique reported Thursday that the pork steaks and ravioli are said to be en route.\nSix Flags Six Flags, Twitter Six Flags St. Louis posted evidence on Twitter of its wager with counterparts at Six Flags Great America over the result of the National League Division Series interstate clash between the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals.
