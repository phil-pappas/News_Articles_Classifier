(Courtesy Photo) By Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com on September 30, 2015 3:06 PM, updated September 30, 2015 3:50 PM \nBethlehem Catholic junior Brooke Adams was asked to move down from the No. 1 spot to the No. 3 position in the Golden Hawks' girls tennis lineup this season. \nInstead of making a big deal about her position change, Adams just went out and worked. \nShe is 14-0 on the season at the No. 3 spot, matching her team's undefeated record. Quite a turnaround for the Golden Hawks after they went 8-9 last season. \n\"This year our team has really improved and we all have ideals of winning. I'm just glad to be able to contribute to my team no matter what position I am,\" Adams said. \n\"For some girls, that move down the ladder would be difficult to handle. However, Brooke accepted her new position, and has played with an intensity and resolve that has been an inspiration to her teammates,\" Bethlehem Catholic coach George Harmanos said. \"By accepting her new position, she has shown the other girls that no matter what position they hold in the lineup, they are vital for the success of the team.\" \nFreshman No. 1 singles player Brenna Magliochetti is also 14-0 on the season. Sophomore Molly Ehrig has a 13-1 record at the No. 2 spot. \n\"I believe that our depth and experience has got us where we are,\" Adams said. \"We all work hard and love the game.\" \n\"The big difference from last year is tennis maturity,\" Harmanos said. \"The core of this team is juniors, who are now in their third year of varsity experience. They have worked hard at their tennis and now have a very good understanding of high school tennis and also their role on the team.\" \nBut did the longtime Golden Hawks coach really expect such an improvement from last year? \n\"We knew that that we would be improved from last season's 8-9 record. We lost only one starter through graduation, and there were two new players who would make an impact,\" Harmanos said. \"Saying that, our success has been more than I expected.\" \nThe Golden Hawks have convincing wins over Nazareth, Central Catholic and Liberty this season. But just how far can Bethlehem Catholic go this season? \n\"Our team strives to be undefeated this season and cannot wait for districts,\" Adams said. \nNo matter how far the Golden Hawks will be able to go this season, they will do it as a complete team. \n\"Our depth at every spot in our lineup has been a major factor,\" Harmanos said. \"The girls know that if they have a tough match, there are other players on the team who are doing well. None of the girls feel that they have to win their match for the team to win. This releases them from the pressure of thinking that team success solely depends on them self. They have confidence in each other.\" \n\"I love my teammates, and we are not just teammates. I consider them all my friends,\" Adams said. \"We all support one another every match and motivate each other on and off the court.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:34:03.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
