(Joe Raymond / Associated Press) Associated Press \nLouisville is investigating allegations that former Cardinals men's basketball staffer Andre McGee brought escorts into dorm parties and paid for the women to strip and have sex with recruits, their fathers and players. \nThose allegations by Katina Powell are in an upcoming book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" from a publishing affiliate of the Indianapolis Business Journal. Some details of the book were published on the Journal's website, noting during a four-year period many of the activities allegedly took place in the players' dormitory. \nLouisville officials say they learned of the allegations in late August and immediately notified the NCAA. McGee left Louisville in 2014 to become an assistant at Missouri Kansas City. That school put McGee on paid leave Friday night and issued a statement saying the allegations were being taken seriously. \nThe age of consent to have sexual intercourse in Kentucky is 16, though in some instances it could be 18. It is unclear if a criminal investigation has also been launched in light of the allegations. \nLouisville Metro Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said she was unaware of any investigation by the department, saying it was an issue to be handled by campus police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:57:04.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
