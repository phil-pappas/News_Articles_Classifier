Dublin, Ga., is a four-time state champion that has produced four NFL players and has had seven 10-win seasons since 2002. But Wallace said he felt something special about the vacancy at Gastonia’s Grier Middle School. “I feel like God led me here,” said Wallace, who leads unbeaten Grier (6-0) into Wednesday’s Gaston County Conference playoffs. “I really believe that. Because I thought this was a good opportunity to help some kids.” Whatever it was, Wallace has kept Grier on its path toward football success. The Knights, winners of 16 straight and 36 of their last 38, are the Division I champion and host Division II runner-up York Chester (5-2) on Wednesday at 4 p.m. Unbeaten Division II champion Belmont (7-0) met Division I runner-up Southwest (5-1) on Tuesday in the other semifinal. Wednesday’s winners meet next week for the 2015 county title. Grier has won an unprecedented four straight championships. “I didn’t feel any pressure on keeping anything going,” said Wallace, a 2008 Gardner-Webb graduate who played running back for the Bulldogs. “I just wanted to make sure the standards stayed high in this program.” Wallace’s coaching staff is comprised of Lamont Elliott, David Warren, Tony Burris and Walt Mallonee. Having record-setting running back Elijah Burris and quarterback Zoe Wallace back from last year’s 8-0 team has certainly helped the new head coach’s transition. Elijah Burris has rushed for 1,067 yards and scored 18 touchdowns this season to surpass recent Grier stars Dallas Danner and Moe Neal as the Knights’ all-time career rushing leader. After rushing for 980 yards last season for Grier’s 8-0 title team, Elijah Burris has 2,047 yards rushing – or just ahead of Danner (2,036) and Neal (1,963). Danner, now at Hunter Huss High, helped the Knights to a 15-1 record and titles in 2012 and 2013 and Neal, now at Forestview High, helped Grier go 12-3 with a semifinal loss in 2010 and a title in 2011. Zoe Wallace has four touchdown passes this season after throwing seven a year ago. “It’s a great accomplishment for Elijah and they’re talented players but it’s not all about them,” Bryan Wallace said. “It’s about our whole team and developing players for the future. “I look at my goal as being one of teaching discipline, character and a respect for academics in addition to being good football players.” In addition to Elijah Burris and Zoe Wallace, Grier has other standouts. On offense, center Malik Carn, guards Kicintai Degree and Jamarion Dawkins, tackles Omarian Boyce and Jaquan Smith and tight ends Tyler Derr and Jay Poole comprise the offensive line and fullback Jarkevis Love, running back Ohaji Montgomery and receiver Dontavius Nash join Elijah Burris and Zoe Wallace in the backfield. And Degree, Dawkins and Reagzon Mackey are the top defenders. “We’ve had a great overall effort from lots of players,” Bryan Wallace said.
