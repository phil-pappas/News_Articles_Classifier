(Photo: Doug McSchooler/for The Star) Buy Photo \nHOUSTON â€“ Quarterback Andrew Luck, still dealing with a shoulder injury suffered Sept. 27, will not play tonight when the Colts take on the Houston Texans, according to an ESPN report. \nLuck has not participated in a legitimate practice since suffering the injury even though he was listed as a limited participant in the Colts' two workouts earlier this week. Those two practices were more or less walkthroughs, with the team giving players a chance to recover physically before the quick turnaround for tonight's game at NRG Stadium. Do Colts gain edge by being coy about injuries? \nLuck was considered questionable on the team's final injury report on Wednesday, but so, too, was backup Matt Hasselbeck. While he is expected to start, according to the report, Hasselbeck has been dealing with an illness in recent days and was unable to practice. Hasselbeck, however, was at the team facility and seemed to be recovering well. \nHasselbeck started Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, guiding the Colts to a 16-13 overtime win. He completed 30 of 47 passes for 282 yards and a touchdown. But the Colts' offense is somewhat limited with Hasselbeck, evidenced by his 6 yards per pass attempt, well below the league average for starting quarterbacks. \nSitting Luck tonight could be the best long-term decision for the Colts. Playing on Thursday will give the Colts 10 days before their next game, which is a big one; the Colts host the New England Patriots on Oct. 18.
