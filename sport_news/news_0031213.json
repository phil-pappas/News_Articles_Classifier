The bump will amount to 1.4 percent for the 2016 season, the team said in a press release. This will mark the fourth time in seven years that prices at Fenway Park have gone up.\n“We recognize the significant commitment and contribution our fans make to this club, especially our season ticket-holders,” CEO Sam Kennedy said. “Our goal each season is to provide value to our fans while continuing to invest in the team and to improve Fenway Park. Preserving 2015 prices for those who purchase tickets early reflects this important balance.”\nPrice increases will affect 12 of the 22 non-premium seating categories. Areas such as the Budweiser right field roof deck, upper bleachers, right field roof box and standing room will not be affected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:44:17.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
