That set up a second-round meeting with Republic of Congo.\nKenya had won its first-leg match 5-2 against Mauritius last week, meaning a 0-0 draw Sunday was more than enough to take the Kenyans through. They will play Cape Verde in the second round next month.\nTanzania held on for a 2-1 aggregate win over Malawi and now faces top-ranked African team Algeria.\nThe three were the first of 13 lower-ranked teams who will make it to Africa's second round. The other 10 first-round matchups will be settled Tuesday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
