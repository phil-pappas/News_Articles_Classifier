Smith had a 26-yard interception return for a score. \n___ \nSTARTS \nNew England and Carolina joined Cincinnati, Denver and Green Bay as the only teams with a 6-0 record this season. That’s the most teams to start 6-0 in NFL history, topping the four from 2009. … Miami’s Dan Campbell is only the fifth interim coach of 26 in the NFL since 2000 to win his first two games, according to STATS. The Dolphins (3-3), who fired Joe Philbin on Oct. 5, beat the Houston Texans 44-26. Miami has scored 82 under Campbell, the most in two games for an interim coach since 1961. \n___ \nSTREAKS & STATS \nTennessee’s 10-7 loss to Atlanta was its fifth straight overall and ninth consecutive on its home field dating to last season. … Kansas City’s 23-13 win over Pittsburgh was its first against the Steelers since Nov. 27, 2011. … Cleveland has gone 19 consecutive games without a 100-yard rusher, and totaled 82 yards on 24 attempts for a 3.4-yard average in a 24-6 loss at Cleveland. Robert Turbin led the team with 30 yards on five carries. … St. Louis has played 18 in a row without a 300-yard passing game. Nick Foles was 15 for 23 for 163 yards with no TDs or interceptions against the Browns. … In Washington’s three wins, including Sunday’s 31-30 victory over Tampa Bay, Kirk Cousins has not thrown a single interception; in the Redskins’ four losses, he has been picked off twice each time. … Before its 28-19 win in Detroit, Minnesota had not won a division road game since also beating the Lions on Sept. 30, 2012. … Houston’s DeAndre Hopkins was held to six catches for 50 yards in a 44-26 loss at Miami, ending his franchise record-tying streak of four consecutive 100-yard games. … New Orleans’ Drew Brees has thrown a touchdown pass in 96 of his last 97 games. \n___ \nMILESTONES \nTom Coughlin joined Hall of Famer Steve Owen as the only Giants coaches with 100 wins with a 27-20 victory over Dallas. … Atlanta’s Matt Ryan became the fifth-fastest quarterback to 30,000 yards passing for his career. He entered the Falcons’ 10-7 win at Tennessee needing just 83 yards to reach that mark in his 117th game, which he got with a 2-yard pass to Julio Jones midway through the second quarter. Only Dan Marino (114), Kurt Warner (114), Peyton Manning (115) and Aaron Rodgers (116) were faster. … In a 44-26 win over Houston, Miami’s Ryan Tannehill became the first quarterback to throw three touchdown passes of 50-plus yards in a first half since Randall Cunningham in 1998, according to STATS. … New England’s Tom Brady became the fifth player in NFL history to reach 55,000 yards passing. … St. Louis’ Todd Gurley became the first rookie since Tampa Bay’s Cadillac Williams in 2005 to rush for at least 125 in each of his first three career starts. \n___ \nFAST FISH \nMiami became the first team in at least 75 years to score four offensive touchdowns of at least 50 yards in a half, according to STATS, cruising to a 44-26 win over Houston. The Dolphins built a 41-0 lead in the first half, tying a franchise record of 21 points in the first quarter, done three other times, and breaking the team mark of 35 points at halftime set in 1967, its second season. Ryan Tannehill completed his first 18 attempts and threw for four scores in the first 16 minutes. He extended his two-game streak to 25 consecutive completions, an NFL record, before he threw his only incompletion in the fourth quarter. The Dolphins had been 0-7 previously against Houston, the only team they had never beaten. \n___ \nLONDON COMEBACK \nJacksonville’s defense came up big in the first half, and Blake Bortles came through late to rally the Jaguars to a 34-31 win over the Buffalo Bills at Wembley Stadium. Bortles threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Allen Hurns with 2:16 remaining, after Buffalo safety Corey Graham intercepted a pass and returned it 44 yards to put the Bills ahead in a seesaw game that was streamed live on Yahoo’s website. The Jaguars won their first game in London after losing in each of the past two seasons at Wembley, the home of England’s national soccer team. \n___ \nSTEELER SHUT DOWN \nPittsburgh’s Landry Jones made his first NFL start in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger and Mike Vick and threw for 209 yards and a touchdown, but he also was picked off twice and lost a fumble that helped end the game — a 23-13 win for Kansas City. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said Roethlisberger, still out with a knee injury, was close to being ready to play, and that the quarterback should be ready to go next week against Cincinnati. \n___ \nA VERY BRADY PERFORMANCE \nTom Brady overcame New England’s shaky first three quarters by throwing for a pair of touchdowns in the fourth, and the Patriots defeated the New York Jets 30-23 to remain unbeaten. He completed 14 of 17 passes in the final quarter to overcome a 20-16 deficit and give New England (6-0) a two-game lead over the Jets in the AFC East. Brady was 34 of 54 for 355 yards overall and also had an 11-yard scramble on a third-and-10. With 15 yards rushing, he was the Patriots’ leading runner for the first time in his career. “I should enjoy this, because it will probably never happen again,” said Brady, who threw the ball on all but nine plays — tying the NFL record for the fewest rushes in a win. \n___ \nDOWN McCOWN \nJosh McCown is 1-5 as the Cleveland starter and has lost to St. Louis for three straight seasons with three different teams, this time a 24-6 defeat Sunday. He was with Chicago in 2013 and Tampa Bay last year. He left for the locker room favoring his right shoulder with about four minutes left, and was replaced by Johnny Manziel. McCown said he was hurt on the second sack/fumble when he was hit on the elbow. \n___ \nCOMEBACK KIRK \nThe Redskins trailed by 24 points in the second quarter, a deficit the team never had overcome in a victory. But Kirk Cousins threw for three second-half TDs, including the go-ahead score to Jordan Reed with 24 seconds left, and the Redskins came back to stun the Bucs 31-30 for the largest comeback in franchise history. Cousins finished 33 for 40 for 317 yards, the trio of scores and zero interceptions. He also ran for an 8-yard touchdown in the second quarter for the first points for the Redskins (3-4), making it 24-7 at halftime. \n___ \nCATCHING ON \nMinnesota’s Stefon Diggs had six receptions for 108 yards, giving him 19 catches for 324 yards in three games after being inactive for the first three games. He joined Anquan Boldin, who made his debut with the Arizona Cardinals in 2003, as the only NFL players since at least 1960 to have that many catches and yards receiving in their first three games, according to STATS. \n___ \nSIDELINED \nHouston’s Arian Foster injured his right Achilles tendon late in the fourth quarter of a 44-26 loss at Miami. Texans coach Bill O’Brien said he didn’t know the severity of the injury, but added “it obviously didn’t look good.”… In St. Louis, Johnny Manziel made his first appearance since Week 2 after Josh McCown hurt his right shoulder late in Cleveland’s 24-6 loss to the Rams. … Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford had X-rays on his left hand after the Lions’ 28-19 loss to Minnesota. … New York Jets center Nick Mangold left in the fourth quarter of New York’s 30-23 loss at New England after hurting his neck when he collided with a defensive lineman. … Washington LB Ryan Kerrigan broke a hand, LB Perry Riley Jr. sustained a lower leg muscle strain and CB Bashaud Breeland strained a hamstring strain. In that game, Buccaneers WRs Louis Murphy and Vincent Jackson left with knee injuries. \n___ \nSPEAKING \n“I’m pretty sure there are fans, or people all over the world that are Redskins fans, that probably were thinking, like, ‘Here we go again. Something bad’s going to happen.’ But everyone on the sideline had the confidence that we were going to score and win the game.” — Redskins defensive tackle Terrance “Pot Roast” Knighton after Washington rallied from 24 points down to beat Tampa Bay 31-30 for the biggest comeback in franchise history. \n___ \n“I’ve been dipping for over 10 years and I’m immune to swallowing dip when I need to. I think it was something I ate.” — Minnesota’s Adrian Peterson, who played a day after being listed as questionable and scoffed at a report that indicated his illness stemmed from swallowing chewing tobacco. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:54:14.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
