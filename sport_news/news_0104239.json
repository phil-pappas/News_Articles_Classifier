That ended a scoreless drought of 107 minutes, 46 seconds for the defending Stanley Cup champions. \nOvechkin sealed the victory at 14:18, scoring from the left side of the net after a back-and-forth with teammate Evgeny Kuznetsov. \nOvechkin was benched Tuesday night in Washington's 5-0 loss to San Jose after missing practice that morning.

Lester is 6-5 with a 2.66 ERA in 15 career postseason games, including 13 starts. \nThe Cubs will find out their opponent for the next round when the Dodgers host the New York Mets in Game 5 of their division series on Thursday night. \nRussell left Game 3 of the NLDS against the Cardinals due to tightness in his left hamstring.

Mozeliak doesn't believe Molina worsened the injury by returning to the lineup for the NL Division Series. \nMolina was hurt making a tag play in Chicago on Sept. 20. He played the first three games of the NLDS with a splint and a bat shaped more like an ax handle. He did not play in Game 4. \nReliever Matt Belisle will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to remove bone chips from his elbow. \nPitcher Carlos Martinez will not need surgery.

LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis Rams guard Rodger Saffold will require season-ending surgery for a right shoulder injury. \nSaffold was the most experienced player on the offensive line, which has two rookie starters. He was a second-round pick in 2010 and underwent surgery on his left shoulder last year. \nCoach Jeff Fisher said Saffold received a second opinion on his latest injury and doctors agreed surgery was necessary. \nThe Rams (2-3) have a bye this week.

They became interim coaches this week after the sudden departures of their bosses. \nThey join Bill Cubit, who was named Illinois' interim coach before the season. \nAccording to STATS, the last time five different Football Bowl Subdivision schools had interim coaches at once during the regular season was 2003, though its records only noted those who took over after the start of the season and didn't include someone in Cubit's situation. \nILLINOIS-NUNN \nIllinois guard Kendrick Nunn injures thumb \nCHICAGO (AP) - Illinois has added starting guard Kendrick Nunn to its long list of injured players with the season less than a month away. \nCoach John Groce said Thursday at Big Ten media day that Nunn injured his left thumb in practice this week.

It wasn't clear how long Nunn will be out. \nSophomore forward Leron Black had knee surgery earlier this month that is expected to keep him out up to six weeks. Freshman guard Jalen Coleman-Lands is out with a stress fracture but expected back by the Nov. 13 opener against North Florida. Guard Tracy Abrams will miss the season. \nBIG TEN-MEDIA DAY \nWisconsin's Ryan still not ruling out coaching next season \nCHICAGO (AP) - Wisconsin's Bo Ryan still is not ruling out coaching next season. \nRyan says he has not made up his mind. \nRyan announced in late June that he planned to retire after this season. But he left the door open to staying on beyond that in August when he said he was \"not totally sure\" if he would step aside. \nOn Thursday at the Big Ten's annual media day, he said he is keeping that door open. \nRyan led Wisconsin to back-to-back Final Four appearances and took the team to last season's national championship game, where the Badgers were defeated by Duke.
