Brenna Magliochetti/Molly Ehrig (Bethlehem Catholic) 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 â€” Rapid Recap \nNotre Dame senior Coco Chen and freshman Logan Lencheski won a three-set classic over Bethlehem Catholic 's Brenna Magliochetti and Molly Ehrig 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 to clinch the District 11 Class AA doubles title on Monday at Lehigh University. \nTurning point : With the third set tied at 5-5, the Crusaders duo battled to victories in the next two games to clinch the championship. Left-hander Lencheski delivered an ace to put the Crusaders up 6-5 and then Chen put the match away with a strong forehand down the middle of the court to secure the championship on Notre Dame's third match point of the game. \nWhat it means : It's the first District 11 girls tennis title in Notre Dame school history. It's also the first one for Chen after advancing to the finals in the singles and doubles tournaments in each of the last two seasons. The Crusaders' senior and freshman pair will head to the state tournament on Nov. 6 in Hershey. For Magliochetti and Ehrig, it was a very impressive showing for a freshman and a sophomore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:56:08.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
