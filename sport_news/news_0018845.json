Big B started shooting for the show, a day after his 73rd birthday on October 11. For one of the acts, Bachchan was required to be in the same frame along with his duplicates.\nHowever, the makers couldn't find any duplicates of Bachchan. The reason being all the duplicates/doubles were called from smaller towns to attend functions as special guests on Bachchan's birthday! The person who co-ordinates the artistes for the show says, We have a database of actors' doubles and we had one for Bachchan's too.\nHe has many fans whose body structure is like Big B's. We contacted at least 10 duplicates, but they had all gone out of town to cut cake on Bachchan's birthday. After a lot of hunting, we finally found one duplicate and shot the sequence with him and sir. Bachchan found it quite funny that everyone was out, but was also very happy for them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:11:43.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
