He has been offered a full athletic scholarship. \n“Drexel had the best opportunity for me to swim at a competitive level and get a great education,” Arthur said. “The city campus definitely sold me, and my future teammates did too.” \nArthur set a state record in the 200 IM (1:49.16) at the 2015 state Meet of Champions and is an All-American in the 200 IM and 100 backstroke. He holds nine of the 11 swimming records at Teaneck. \nWith the Dragons, Arthur will join his friend and former Bergen Catholic swimmer, Ralph Cannarozzi, on the roster. With his versatility, he can fit into their lineup in just about any spot. Although in big meets, he’ll likely focus on the IM and the backstroke. He plans on studying biology or business. \n“I made this decision on my own, and I have my mom, dad and sister, Brenda, to thank for that,” Arthur said. “When I told them my decision, they all said they were proud of me, and I owe it all to them because I wouldn’t be in this position of success without their support.” \nGEE TO DOMINICAN: Immaculate Conception senior Jasmine Gee has given a verbal commitment to play basketball at Division II Dominican. She was offered a full scholarship. \nThe Englewood native averaged 11.5 points and 8.7 rebounds for the Blue Wolves, helping them reach the Non-Public B state title game. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:06:46.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
