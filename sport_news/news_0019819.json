They will be rusty from having been removed from the game for more than a week and will have lost any momentum they had from the previous game. Which Jets team turns up Sunday at MetLife Stadium is anyone’s guess, but recent history — albeit under the leadership of a different head coach — is not on their side.\nThe bye week for previous coach Rex Ryan was like a Rubik’s Cube. He never figured it out, with his teams going 1-5 the week after the bye.\nThere is a belief inside the Jets locker room that new coach Todd Bowles has a better handle on things.\n“It’s a totally different team, a new regime, a different mindset on how we go about our business, and how we practice is totally different from when Rex was here,’’ guard Willie Colon told The Post on Thursday.\nDifferent how?\nBills head coach Rex Ryan had an awful post-bye record with the Jets. Photo: AP “We’re called out more now,’’ Colon said. “Bowles makes sure that if we come out flat, he lets us know about it. It’s easy to have a veteran team and allow the veteran team to just put in a day’s work. But Bowles doesn’t let that happen. He makes sure we have the right mentality and enthusiasm, that we’re on our Ps and Qs and that we’re playing the right way.\n“He understands we do have a good team here, that we can do things here and we can be a special team. But it’s not something that’s granted to you. You’ve got to earn it.’’\nThis is what one of Bowles’ messages to his players has been since they returned to work Monday: We haven’t accomplished anything yet.\n“It’s only 3-1, a quarter of the season,’’ Bowles said Thursday. “We’ve only played one quarter. It’s like a game. The first quarter doesn’t mean you lost the game. The first quarter of the [season] doesn’t mean we got to the playoffs. We’ve got a long way to go. The season’s young. You can go from the penthouse to the outhouse real quick.’’\nHere is another pitfall staring the Jets in the face: next week’s impending AFC East showdown with the Patriots in Foxborough, Mass.\nAllow your mind to wander beyond Sunday and imagine a Jets win over the Redskins to get them to 4-1 and a New England win over the Colts to get them to 5-0, and think about the overwhelming hype machine that will spin madly.\nNow, we know the Jets are not good enough to be looking past any team and ahead to another.\nBut do they know?\nThis is where another stern behind-the-scenes Bowles message is ringing in the ears of his players like whatever song is piping through their headphones in pregame warm-ups.\n“It would be very foolish for us to think anything about New England with the Redskins coming here in two days,’’ Colon said. “When it’s time for New England, we’ll approach that accordingly. If our minds aren’t in it, we will get embarrassed. It could be ugly early if we come in there and our minds aren’t right.’’\nColon said the team “learned’’ its “lesson’’ in its lackluster 24-17 home loss to the Eagles — the only blemish on its record.\n“If we don’t want a repeat of that we have to start fast and physical and set the tone,’’ Colon said.\n“We still have a long way to go to get better and do the things we need to do,’’ Bowles said. “So we have no reason to be patting ourselves on the back.’’\nThe question is: Do his players fully understand that?\nWe’ll know the answer by about 4 p.m. Sunday. If the answer is what the Jets hope it is, then let the Patriots showdown-week hype begin in earnest.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under new york jets ,  rex ryan ,  todd bowles ,  willie colon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:55:37.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
