Photo by Linda Robertson. Former White Sox coach and player Naomi Shaw is in Dunedin to share her knowledge of the game. \nShaw, who coached the women's national side from 2010 to 2014, held three coaching modules at Softball Otago's headquarters at Ellis Park yesterday. \nThe programme will continue today and tomorrow and features modules for beginner and more experienced coaches. \nShaw, who has worked as an officer for Softball New Zealand since 2004, played for the White Sox for more than a decade and was captain of the side when it won the world championship in 1982. \nBefore taking over as head coach in 2010, she was assistant coach from 1992 to 1998, and was also a national selector for eight years from 1991. \nPart of her role for Softball NZ is to develop coaches, which sees her travel around the country to run coaching clinics. \nYesterday, Shaw held a rookie sox pitching and catching module, an essential skills module and an introduction unit. \n''I'm a regular visitor to Otago,'' she said. \n''So they're pro-active in terms of upskilling their coaches, which is really, really important. \n''I want to get alongside local people who have the knowledge, experience and capability to deliver these courses. \n''It's important that we try and upskill people within the regions to deliver the same modules that I'm delivering so they are more readily available for regions.'' \nThe programme comes at a good time for softball in Dunedin, which is struggling with just two teams - Cardinals and Dodgers - in its premier league this season. \nHowever, Shaw said the decline in people playing the game was not limited to Dunedin or softball. \n''It's a little bit indicative of sport in general,'' she said. \n''Times are changing. There is just so much choice. And we're all pretty proactive about getting our sports out there and trying to encourage people to join our sport. But our population hasn't exploded and everybody is trying to hit on the same person.'' \nShaw believes softball should appeal to people because a fast-pitched game can be over in an hour and a-half, but she said coaches needed to ensure people giving the sport a go enjoyed the experience and returned. \n''I call us a service industry. We have to be really good about the service we deliver and that's the way we retain them.'' \nOutside of her day for Softball NZ, Shaw helps coach Hutt Valley, the team she guided to six national provincial titles during the 2000s.
