That's pretty amazing. \n\"Every win we can get right now is just a bonus on how strong we'll be in the future. That's really what we're working on and focusing on.\" \nWhen Stayton freshman midfielder Izaland Samuell broke through with 11 minutes left and scored on a breakaway, it was the first time in the league season Cascade had given up a goal, a streak of 309 minutes without being scored on. \n\"I'm really proud of my defensive line,\" Walling said. \"They really save my butt a lot of the time. And it's so great to have them and be able to trust them. They just have such great skill and I know that they can do everything.\" \nbpoehler@StatesmanJournal.com, (503) 399-6701 or Twitter.com/bpoehler \nCascade 2, Stayton 1 \nCAS- Petterson (Wiebenga) 38:00; CAS- Petterson 53:00; STA- Samuell 69:00.
