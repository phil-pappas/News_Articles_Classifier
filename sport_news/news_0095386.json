It depends who the manager decides to start with. He has just told me to work hard in training for now and work on the things that I don’t normally do so that when I get my chance he knows he can rely on me \n“We have started really well this season. The first five games in the Premier League were pretty good but we lost a few games after that and our form hasn’t been as good. I think we are going to improve a lot and hopefully we can pick up where we left off against Newcastle when we play Bournemouth. \n“We are top of the table now, but I think we will do even better so if we keep playing well we will stay top for a long time and maybe win the Premier League if we work hard together, though obviously that’s a long way off.” Witn City missing five players going into the weekend, Kelechi says it is important for the whole squad to contribute towards what is a vital week ahead for City. \n“Everyone is part of the team but that’s why we have such a strong squad,” he addec. “Those players who aren’t normally in the team must now work hard and make sure that we get the three points in every game that we play. \n“It’s a big blow to have those players missing but we have to focus on the game and not worry about who is not playing. \n“We don’t have to think about them being injured and what we’re going to do. We are here to work together so we must come in, get the games, do very well and make them proud. \n“We also have Vincent Kompany back now and he pushes the team along and gets everyone going. He’s a great captain and everyone is happy to have him back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:24:03.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
