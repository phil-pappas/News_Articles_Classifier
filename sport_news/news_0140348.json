An unsuccessful two-point pass left the score 12-6. \nFollowing a 39-yard return of the subsequent kickoff by Tim Hawley, SV took possession at Owego’s 41-yard line. Three consecutive incomplete passes brought fourth down with 35 seconds remaining — and a 21-yard pass from Cameron Manchester to Hawley. Two plays later, Manchester found Alex Ewanow for a 12-yard gain to the 7, and the Sabers called timeout with 11 seconds to play. \nOn first down, Manchester rolled out to pass, saw nothing available, took off on the run and — thanks in part to a block from flanker Kyle Novobilski — scored the tying TD with 3.9 seconds to play. And then … \n“We probably tried to ice our own kicker by calling a timeout to get our blocking in order,” SV coach Mike Ford said. Five minutes before, Hawley had a PAT try blocked when a leak sprang in the middle of the line. \nBut the second-chance opportunity was true, and the Sabers dealt Owego a second consecutive loss. \n“A big focus coming into the game was Will Gladney,” Ford said of the Indians’ 6-3, 210-pound receiver, “and I think we did a good job of bottling him up.” \nGladney’s three receptions went for 15 yards on a day SV gained 344 yards of offense to SV’s 341. \nSusquehanna Valley (2-3) improved to 2-2 in Division II, leaving the Sabers a reasonable chance to claim one of four Section 4 Class B playoff spots. \nUnscripted success \nMaine-Endwell quarterback Kyle Balmer threw a pair of first-half touchdown passes Friday night, and both were jaw-droppers. \nThe latter came 12.3 seconds before halftime, a strike to Drew Gallagher at the left sideline that gave the Spartans a 31-16 lead going into halftime. \nBut his first scoring pass arguably was even better. On a third-and-goal from JC's 13, Balmer rolled left and looked to the left side of the end zone, but the Wildcats had it well-covered. Balmer extended the play as long as possible, giving Kevin Barrett time to free himself from coverage as he moved to the middle of the field. Balmer, now near the left sideline, heaved a pass to the back of the end zone that a wide-open Barrett caught. Scott Clark's ensuing two-point run tied the score at 8 on the first play of the second quarter. \n\"I thought the first (touchdown) pass was great, too,\" JC coach Fred Deinhardt said of Balmer. \"He extended the play and threw back across the field.\" \nJC defenders also had some success against Balmer, with Kenny Johns and T.J. Williams intercepting the senior quarterback. \nPenalty-prone Wildcats \nSixteen penalties for 155 yards no doubt hurt JC's chances at pulling an upset against the Spartans. Penalties also played a huge role for the 2-3 Wildcats during a 28-20 loss to Owego in Week 2. \n\"Penalties are something we've been working on and focusing on, but we need to do a better job,\" Deinhardt said. \"If we can limit those, we'll be in better positions a lot of times.\" \nIn a penalty-filled game, the Spartans were flagged nine times for 90 yards. \nClever kick \nProtecting a 10-point lead with 8:38 left in the fourth quarter and facing a fourth-and-8 from Waverly's 38, Chenango Valley called a timeout. When the Warriors came out of the timeout, it looked as if they were going for it, with quarterback Mark Mullins in shotgun formation. But when Mullins received the snap, he instead punted. It was a beauty, a 34-yarder that the Warriors downed at the 4. \nAfter the Wolverines drove to CV's 35, Nick Pert — the Warriors' regular punter — intercepted a Peyton Miller pass that all but sealed a 22-12 victory. \nQuite a turnaround \nChenango Valley earned narrow victories over Norwich (26-24) and Windsor (13-8) the first two weeks before hosting Newark Valley in Week 3. The 4-1 Warriors walked off the field that day on the wrong end of a 35-0 outcome. \nSince then, they knocked off a 3-0 Owego squad, 27-19, and handed Waverly its first loss of the season this past Saturday. \n\"I think that Newark Valley game was positive for us,\" said junior fullback Aaron Trumino, who banged his way for 95 yards against Waverly. \"It kind of humbled us. It really motivated us to get better.\" \nAdded CV coach Jay Hope: \"We were making catastrophic mistakes the first three weeks. We weren't even stepping on our feet; we were cutting off our legs. The last two games, we've put things together.\" \nBounce-back a beauty \nIt seems Tioga Central’s players took to heart messages delivered on the practice field in the wake of a 35-32 loss to Newark Valley in Week 4. On Saturday, the Tigers scored the first 30 points and proceeded to a 36-14 win over previously unbeaten Harpursville. \n“After we watched the film, it was more about going back to basics,” coach Nick Aiello said. “We were very fundamentally poor on both sides of the ball, especially defensively. I think a little bit was inexperience from a personnel standpoint on defense. Even though it was the fourth game, I think our inexperience showed. \n“On offense, we just lapsed. We weren’t ready to play a four-quarter game and come off the ball for four quarters. That was really the tone all week— get back to what matters.” \nAnd so they did, with 359 yards worth of rushing led by 209 from Jesse Manuel on 29 carries. That brought Section 4’s all-time leader to 1,068 this season and 6,745 in four varsity seasons. \n“My goodness, that kid’s vision and his ability to cut back is unlike something you see at the high school level — and he’s been doing it for quite a while,” said Hornets coach Tim Petras. “It’s a combination of being well-coached and also having a lot of physical gifts. \n“He’s patient, he trusts his line, and when he sees a seam, he hits it hard.” \nOf that offensive front from Tioga, Petras said: “Tioga is always well-coached in the offensive line. They’re big, they’re physical, they’ve got a little bit of a mean streak in there, and the biggest thing is they block to the whistle. They execute their folds, their cross blocks, their double-teams, execute them with perfection. What makes them tough is, they make very, very few mistakes.” \nExpress defense dominating \nBack in Week 2, the Elmira Express survived for a 44-43 victory against Binghamton despite surrendering 525 yards of offense, including 353 through the air. So who gave the defense an earful after that effort? Offensive coordinator Mike Johnston Jr., of course. \n“Our offensive coach had a lot to say about it,” said senior running back/linebacker Allaah Sessions. “He was getting at us about it, so we definitely have been working way harder on defense.” \nThe results have been obvious, albeit somewhat overshadowed by an Elmira running game that has helped the team score 192 points in the past three games, with the most recent blowout a 59-6 victory against a Syracuse Nottingham team that came into Saturday’s contest with a 3-1 record. The Express defense has surrendered two touchdowns and 408 yards over the past three games, which is actually misleading when you consider Nottingham gained 185 of its 196 yards after halftime against the Elmira reserves. \nCoach Jimmy McCauley said preparation in practice has produced results on game day. \n“The two things we preach during the week are making sure you line up correctly, so that’s alignment. And making sure you know what you’re supposed to do on the play,” he said. “So alignment and assignment are huge for us. We don’t ever want to get outflanked. We don’t ever want to lose leverage.” \nOverall, McCauley has liked most everything he has seen from his team heading into Saturday’s showdown at home against Corning (4-1). \n“The kids are doing a great job of studying film. The kids are doing a great job of buying in,” he said. “I’ve got the easy part. Those guys have to go out on the field and put it in play. Those guys work their butts off, and we really appreciate it.” \nSchuyler County success story \nNeither Watkins Glen nor Odessa-Montour had qualified for the Section 4 playoffs since the state tournament started in 1993. As a combined team, however, Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour has already clinched one of the two Class C semifinal berths out of Division V, thanks to four straight victories since a 55-12 loss to Owego to open the season. \nThe Seneca Indians’ clinching win came Saturday by a 58-8 score against Thomas A. Edison, with WG/O-M finishing 1 yard shy of the 600 mark in total offense. \n“The kids are really buying in and really coming together as a team, two separate schools into one team,” said coach Lou Condon Jr., who previously coached Watkins Glen. “They’re working real hard and have just meshed real well together. Our fans are great. It was so cold and rainy (Saturday), yet we still had hundreds of fans out there. … I applaud our kids and fans. Just really proud of the effort.” \nThere was added significance to Saturday’s game, with coaching staffs for both schools wearing T-shirts with the phrase “No One Fights Alone” on the front to support Edison assistant coach Zach Brown, who is battling Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Brown is a teacher at Watkins Glen and is also head varsity baseball coach at Edison. He is not coaching football or teaching this year as he deals with his illness. \n“Zach’s a really close personal friend to (Edison coach Mike Bennett) and his staff, and I work with Zach here at Watkins,” Condon said. “We’re all pulling for him and hope everything works out for him.” \nHawks respond in close game \nIf there was one thing Corning’s season had lacked before Friday, it was drama. The Hawks started with a 54-7 loss to Maine-Endwell, then bounced back to win each of their next three games by at least 21 points. Corning made it four wins in a row with a 28-26 victory over Vestal that saw the Hawks trail 14-0, then come up with two stops on two-point conversion tries in the closing minutes. \n“Obviously, any time you’re down 14-0, it creates a situation where some people get worried about that,” Corning coach George Bacalles said. “We believe in the kids, and the kids believe in themselves. We went to our double-wing package, and it worked out better; we got a key fumble and caused a turnover, and had a 95-yard drive. It’s a credit to the kids to have that belief they can come back. Obviously, winning in a close-game environment is not something any coach wants to do, but hopefully, it’s going to help us out in the future, and we’ll have that confidence if we’re in a situation like that again.” \nDevon Sullivan had a 47-yard touchdown run for Corning with 1 minute, 58 seconds left, helping to increase the lead to 28-20. Vestal scored a touchdown with nine seconds left before the Hawks held on the potential tying two-point try. Some may argue Sullivan would have been better off stopping short of the end zone, but Bacalles thought his player made the proper choice. \n“I’m not going to tell a kid to take a dive or something like that,” Bacalles said. “We knew Vestal had the ability to drive down the field real quick, and that’s a credit to coach (Tank) Anderson and his staff, and (quarterback) T.J. Wegmann is a phenomenal player. It’s a credit to their kids having that never-say-die attitude, and they did a good job.” \nKevin Stevens & Andrew Legare contributed. 2 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1LeyY0o TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:05:27.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
