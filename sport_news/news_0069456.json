As the referee blew his whistle to signal the start of his penalty kick Saturday afternoon at Maple Stadium, Tecumseh’s Montoya quickly turned and fired his shot past a diving Milan goaltender, giving the Indians a 1-0 lead and setting the stage for Tecumseh’s first District soccer title since 2010. “I just wanted to get it over with, get my team going,” Montoya said. “I was ready.” His goal was the first of the day. When the Indians’ final penalty kick by Noah Crots found the back of the net, the Indians had the District 2 trophy sewn up. “Penalty kicks are always a nerve-wrecking situation,” Crots said. “It’s always a 50-50 shot if the keeper is going to guess which way you are going. I just tried to take my shot and hope for the best.” The two teams played to 0-0 tie through the 90 minutes of regulation and two 10-minute overtime sessions, leading to the penalty kick portion. Each team had five shots on goal from five different players. After Montoya made his shot, Milan’s first shot hit the post and bounced away, giving the Indians the advantage. Josh Nowak scored on his shot, Owen Swan on his and then Crots hit the game-winner. Milan’s goal came from Bing Schaefer and Connor Millina. Tecumseh goalie Gabe Giovannone made a great save on one of the Milan penalty kicks. Milan keeper Kyle Briggs was impressive, too, in making a diving stop. Both goalies were strong during regulation, making some key stops during a windy afternoon in Adrian. “There goalie was a big reason we couldn’t find the net,” Tecumseh coach Jerry Nowak said. “He was tough in there. “I knew this was not going to be easy. I’m not surprised at all it was 0-0. … We had our chances. Both teams had chances. We just couldn’t make that last pass, the one more pass that we needed. I’m happy with this. It’s our first since 2010 when we won it right here.” Tecumseh, from the Southeastern Conference White Division, has gone 10-1-3 over its last 14 matches. “We’ve played some good teams during that stretch,” Nowak said. “We’ve been playing well.” Milan, from the Huron League, advanced to the district final by beating Ypsilanti. The Big Reds finish the season 9-6-5, coach Simon Evans said. “It was a tough game. Both teams had chances at both ends of the fields. They play really good defense,” Evans said. “We tried to get behind them, get one level behind, but we weren’t too successful at it. It was a good effort on our part. I’m proud of my guys.” Page 2 of 2 - Evans praised the efforts of Milan goalie Kyle Briggs. “Our keeper played a heck of a game,” he said. “We just came up two stops short.” Tecumseh advances to the Division 2 Regional at 7 p.m. Wednesday to play Dearborn Divine Child. Trenton and Mason are on the other side of the bracket. The finals are 1 p.m. Saturday. The Indians (11-5-3) will be ready to play, Crots said, but they also want to enjoy winning the District. “This is Heaven on Earth,” Crots said. “What an amazing feeling.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:58:17.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
