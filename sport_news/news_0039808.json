As BJP MLAs assaulted him, several NC and Congress MLAs rushed to save him. The legislator from Langate had yesterday hosted the beef party in the lawns of MLA Hostel here, with the guests being served beef kebabs, ‘ristas’ (meat balls) and beef patties. Rashid had claimed that he did not want to offend anyone but wanted to send a message that “no courts or legislature can prevent the people from eating what they want”. The step was “just to give them (legislators) a clear message that it hardly makes any difference whether you accept or reject the Bill ... religious matters cannot be kept subservient to courts and assembly,” the MLA had said. “Nobody on earth, no assembly, no court and no institution can stop us from having what we want to have,” he added. The beef row erupted after a Division Bench of the High Court in Jammu directed the state to strictly implement the ban in the state as per the law. The order had evoked strong resentment from various quarters with many separatist and religious organisations terming it as “interference in religious affairs” and sought revocation of the law, besides pressing for implementation of ban on liquor in the state. The issue is now before the Supreme Court. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:12:16.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
