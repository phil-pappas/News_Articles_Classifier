Anna-Jonesboro's number 21, junior Dylan Fox, runs the ball while number 2, senior Collin Prather, and number 14, sophomore Bryce Osman, block for him during last Friday night's high school homecoming football game against visiting Carterville. Posted: Thursday, October 1, 2015 9:49 am | Updated: 4:43 pm, Thu Oct 1, 2015. The Anna-Jonesboro Community High School football team was in a good position last Friday, Sept. 25. The Wildcats trailed by two points and prepared to kick a 21-yard field goal. The kick was off the mark and visiting Carterville claimed a 27-25 hard fought win to dampen A-J's homecoming festivities at The Pit. \"No doubt people forget you have to be perfect in four things in a field goal: snap, hold, protection and the kick,\" A-J coach Brett Detering said. \"One guy didn't miss a kick. We put ourselves in a position to win and we didn't execute.\" Lion coach Dennis Drust further hampered the Wildcats by calling back-to-back timeouts. With all four things for a successful kick to be just right, the snap appeared high and the ball was off the mark. The Wildcats and Lions each now have identical 2-3 records. A-J wasted little time getting its offense rolling to open the game. The Wildcats launched an 80-yard 15-play drive that was capped by quarterback Jake Stark scoring on a 3-yard run. Dakota Earnhart's extra point kick boosted A-J to a 7-0 lead with 4:03 remaining in the opening quarter. The Lions bounced back with a 12-play drive that quarterback Blake Hicks closed out with a 1-yard run. Jeff Giffey's extra point kick knotted the game 7-7 with no time left in the first quarter. The Wildcats were driving again on their next possession when Christian Albert intercepted a Stark pass. Lion running back Markas Lazdinis then scored on an 18-yard run to cap a 10-play drive. Giffey's extra point kick boosted the Lions to a 14-7 advantage with 2:48 remaining in the second quarter. The Wildcats were forced to punt on their next possession and Carterville's drive stalled when a Hicks pass was intercepted by Earnhart. A-J moved downfield around a 38-yard pass reception from Stark to Earnhart. With 44 seconds remaining in the first half, Earnhart booted a 34-yard field goal to pull A-J to 14-10. The A-J defense stiffened to open the second half and forced the Lions to punt for the first time in the game. The Wildcats bounced back and moved deep into Lion territory before being halted on a fourth down. \"We should have been able to get that on fourth and one,\" Detering said. \"It's a game of inches.\" Four plays later, Hicks scored on an 18-yard run. Giffey's kick put the Lions on top 21-10 with 5:22 remaining in the third quarter. A-J then launched a 11-play drive that was capped by Alec Gold scoring on a 2-yard run. Stark passed to Dylan Fox for the extra point conversion to pull A-J to 21-18 with 11:41 remaining in the final quarter. Carterville was forced to punt again and after an 8-play drive, A-J's Gold scored again on a 14-yard run. Earnhart's extra point kick boosted the Wildcats to a 25-21 lead with 5:32 remaining in the game. The Wildcats then drove to midfield and fumbled the football and Hicks picked it up and rambled 40 yards for a TD. The extra point kick failed and Carterville pulled ahead 27-25 with 3:19 remaining in the game. The Wildcats were attempting to move the football to the left side of the field when they attempted the final field goal. Detering said Earhnart is a left-footed kicker and moving to the left side of the field would have increased the chances of having a successful field goal. Stark was 4 of 8 passing for 89 yards with one interception. Gold led the Wildcats rushing attack with 165 yards in 33 carries. \"Gold ran well after coming off an injury,\" Detering said. Carterville's rushing gme was held to 140 yards rushing, while A-J rushed for 286 yards. The Wildcats' Collin Prather had 38 yards rushing on 5 carries and Caleb Clover added 35 yards on 5 carries. \"We didn't make plays when we needed to,\" Detering said. \"We very easily could be 2-0 in the conference. We've done that to ourselves the last two weeks. All you can do is go forward and look to next week's game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:13:53.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
