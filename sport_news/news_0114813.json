Gordon said she was excited at the opportunity to help replenish the local supply. \nTamara Kilgore, marketing communications manager for the Institute for Transfusion Medicine, helped to organize the event with Central Blood Bank. She reached out to the Aliquippa School District and to Gordon to plan the drive. \nWhile the blood collected Tuesday won't go directly to DiMantae, Kilgore said it will go to a variety of patients in need across western Pennsylvania. \nDiMantae and some of his cousins attended the blood drive. While DiMantae couldn't donate blood, he thanked his supporters. He's excited to play football next year when he retakes his senior year, and said he's feeling well. \nAt first, the diagnosis rocked him, he said. But as he saw how much the community supported and prayed for him, he filled with hope. \nAccording to Gordon, DiMantae's doctors are pleased with his test results, and told her his cancer is in remission. He will still need to undergo his scheduled treatments. \nDiMantae has been dedicated to supporting the Aliquippa football team, and said he's gone to all the games with the team. Similarily, the community has been supportive of him. Kilgore said the turn out for the blood drive was strong. \nFrom behind a shy smile, DiMantae said if he could like his supporters with one thing, it would be to say thank you.
