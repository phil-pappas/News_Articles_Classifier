The Titans announced Thursday that the Elias Sports Bureau corrected an incomplete pass on the first offensive play of Tennessee's opening 42-14 win at Tampa Bay by changing the scoring.\nA penalty was called on the play, and Mariota originally was credited with an incomplete pass while a Tampa Bay penalty was enforced after the play. Elias changed the scoring with the penalty negating the play.\nMariota still had a perfect 158.3 passer rating for the game. He now has one less incompletion, boosting his passer rating from 109.2 to 110.3 along with a 63.5 completion percentage instead of 62.9.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:44:31.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
