He's very confident in his ability and he works hard.\n\"He's not going to surrender without a fight and he's not going to let his teammates surrender either.\"\nOn Friday night, Chaney will lead Delsea into what he calls the team's \"biggest battle of the season.\"\nDelsea is No. 1 in the Inquirer Top 25. Hammonton is No. 3.\nBoth teams are 6-0 and angling for the WJFL National Division title, for top seeds in their respective state tournaments, and for the No. 1 ranking in South Jersey.\n\"This is the game I've been waiting for all year,\" Chaney said.\nMarchese said the 6-foot-0, 305-pound Chaney is Delsea's \"most consistent\" lineman on both sides of the football.\nThe coach chalks up Chaney's improvement from his junior to his senior season to his first winter with the Delsea wrestling team.\n\"I think that made a big difference in his conditioning, in his ability to go the extra mile,\" Marchese said.\nChaney agrees. He never wrestled before last winter, when he was the Crusaders' 285-pounder and helped the team to the Group 3 state title with a pin in the championship match.\n\"I was around 315, 320 last year,\" Chaney said. \"But I got down to 285 and it really helped with my conditioning, my breathing.\n\"I got in the weight room after wrestling and got back up to 300. But I feel stronger. I used to get gassed last year. Now I feel strong all game.\"\nMarchese calls Chaney \"a pure power blocker\" who has helped clear the way for ballcarriers such as fullback Rashaad Williams and quarterback Quinn Collins.\nIn the victory over Paul VI, Chaney's block sprang Taj Summiel to score the game-winning touchdown, completing Delsea's rally from a 13-point deficit in the final four minutes.\n\"That's how I am,\" Chaney said of his never-say-die attitude during the darkest moments of that game against No. 11 Paul VI. \"I'm going to stay positive. I'm going to keep playing hard and I'm going to make sure my teammates keep their heads up and keep playing hard, too.\"\npanastasia@phillynews.com\n@PhilAnastasia\nwww.philly.com/\njerseysidesports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:14:50.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
