Westhill High School principal Camille Figluizzi filed a grievance with the FCIAC and the CIAC in support of Vikings’ football coach Frank Marcucio and the athletic department, FCIAC executive secretary John Kuczo said on Thursday. At issue is the postponement of the Vikings’ game with the Rams, which had originally been scheduled for last Friday night at Dunning Field in New Canaan. With heavy rains and strong winds forecast, the game was pushed back and rescheduled for Monday evening, when the weather was calm and clear. Marcucio has claimed that the decision to move the game was done without the Vikings’ consent, which is a violation of the FCIAC’s procedure for postponements. New Canaan head coach Lou Marinelli cited the poor conditions, safety issues, and the fact that the better weather allowed more fans to attend the game on Monday. “It was a Nor’Easter,” Marinelli said after the game. “It was raining like crazy and we had a pretty decent crowd tonight. If we had to do it all over again, we’d do it again.” He said that the game was not rescheduled for Saturday, as poor weather was again forecast. New Canaan High School Athletic Director Jay Egan made the call to Westhill A.D. Larry Savo on Friday morning. When the game was finally played on Monday, New Canaan routed Westhill, 55-12, behind six touchdown passes by quarterback Michael Collins, who now has 17 in three games. Marcucio complained that the result would have been different had the game been played in the rain, as the Rams’ offense is heavily-weighted to the passing attack. “Bottom line is this, if we played them on Friday night like we were supposed to the outcome would have been a lot different,” Marcucio told the Advocate. “They know it, we know it, they ran the ball five times in the whole first half, we knew the weather would give them trouble, what they did was wrong and that’s why we filed a formal complaint.” According to Kuczo, for a game to be postponed, FCIAC by-laws require an agreement between the athletic directors of the two schools involved. If the two athletic directors cannot agree, the decision moves to the principals of the two schools. If an agreement still cannot be reached, the decision then moves to Kuczo as the FCIAC’s executive secretary. All those steps are supposed to play out as quickly as possible so a decision can be reached, but the league was not contacted. Kuczo said that the FCIAC had heard the grievance and sent a response to Westhill, but the information will not be made public. The CIAC’s by-laws defer postponement issues to leagues. According to the CIAC’s handbook for 2015-16, Article IV, Section E, Line 4A: “When contests are scheduled among two or more league teams, the league should determine the definition of what constitutes a postponed game.” When the game was postponed, Marcucio and some of the Vikings took to Twitter and Facebook to voice their displeasure. Marcucio tweeted “only game in the state moved – makes no sense unless you don’t play well in inclement weather ??? ???” Those kinds of comments fired up the Rams, according to Marinelli. “With all the tweets and all the things that were said, I think they did more to motivate our kids than the coaches did,” Marinelli said. “They had something to prove tonight. We still have to work some things out and we have a long way to go, but it was certainly good to come out and answer the tweets on the field. “I was worried,” Marinelli said. “I thought it was going to be a trap game. But they did more to motivate out kids than I did. The kids just kind of took it on their own.
