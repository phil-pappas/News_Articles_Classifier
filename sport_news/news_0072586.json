Show Caption \nThe formula for beating Tusculum College this season has been with the run game. \nNorth Greenville running back Ashton Heard took that to a new level Saturday afternoon. \nHeard rushed for 315 yards and two touchdowns on 31 carries as the Wolves defeated the Pioneers 35-24 at Younts Stadium in Tigerville, S.C. \nNorth Greenville (5-2) was the latest team to find success on the ground against Tusculum (3-4). Virginia State rushed for 347 yards in a 40-13 victory over Tusculum on Sept. 12. A week later, Lenoir-Rhyne's quarterback and running back each rushed for more than 200 yards in a triple-overtime win over Tusculum. Newberry College amounted 336 rushing yards in a victory on Sept. 26. \nTusculum has allowed 2,055 rushing yards this season for an average of 293.6 per game. \nNorth Greenville took a 7-0 lead 19 seconds into the game on Heard's tone-setting 68-yard touchdown run. \nTusculum's Cameron Thomas returned an interception 54 yards for a touchdown to cut the Pioneers' deficit to 9-7 in the first quarter, but Heard reeled off a 49-yard run to end the quarter and give the Wolves a 15-7 lead. \nWhile Heard was done scoring after the first quarter, his rushing helped North Greenville record 27 first downs. \nIsaac Robinson pulled Tusculum within 22-14 with a 54-yard touchdown run midway through the second quarter, but the Pioneers' normally strong passing game was held in check. \nQuarterback Luke Lancaster was 25 of 45 for 178 yards and three interceptions. He had a 4-yard touchdown pass to Justin Houston late in the game. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
