Facing undefeated Notre Dame Academy Tuesday evening, Turco’s charges had an edge to prove last season’s 18-5-1 record - their first non-state championship season since 2009 - was just a fluke. “The old phrase is 'practice like you’re number two and play like you’re number one.’ And I tell my girls, ‘I got news for you: You ain’t number one’,” Turco said. The Red Raiders took that message and ran with it, as well as the match, winning 3-0 against the Cougars. Coming into the match sporting a 12-1, 4-0 Old Colony League record and riding a four-game win streak after losing to Andover, Barnstable methodically jumped out to 9-2 lead while they attacked the net and relied on communication. Notre Dame (13-1), ranked as the top team in Division 2, while Barnstable is fourth in Division 1, showed some fight and cut the lead to 15-12 as they went on a 10-6 run before Turco called a timeout to regather his team. “I don’t need to motivate those girls for these type of games. They absolutely love these type of tests,” he said. The Red Raiders finished off the Cougars 25-20 to take the first game. Notre Dame battled strike for strike in the second game led by junior outside hitter Katie Howley’s 15 kills on 39 attempts. Add in 33 assists for senior captain setter Corinne Cox and the Red Raiders found themselves committing uncharacteristic errors, but was able to power through to secure the 28-26 win in game two. A 25-20 victory in game three earned a match sweep for Barnstable, as coach Turco was honored for his 600th victory prior to the start of the game. “Six-hundred wins mean a) I’ve been doing this for a long time and b) I’ve been lucky to have players who embrace the team concept,” Turco said. “We had players who didn’t get to play tonight who are truly excited about this victory tonight. And it’s players embracing the team mentality that helps me coach them.” For the Raiders, senior middle hitter Madison Swallows led the team with 14 kills while freshman outside hitter Riley James chipped in with 9 kills and 16 defensive digs. Turco raved about the team’s defensive stands against the hard-striking Cougars. “I have to give credit to my girls. There was some great defensive plays, some great defensive digs in tough situations.” By Wesley Sykes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:52:22.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
