But the Frenchman's troubles, which originated with a 2011 payment of two million Swiss francs ($2.04 million) from Blatter's FIFA for work done nine years earlier, have dramatically changed the electoral landscape.\nEarlier this month, Platini was handed a 90-day provisional ban from soccer by FIFAâ€™s Ethics Committee -- a decision which has quickly led to his support dissipating.\nPlatini has appealed the ban and could yet be let back into the race for the Feb. 26 vote if he is successful in overturning the judgment.\nSheikh Salman will face another member of Arab royalty in the election with Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein have already submitted his nominations.\nOn Saturday, South African former Apartheid-era political prisoner turned businessman Tokyo Sexwale announced he would be standing in the election after winning backing from the South African Football Association.\nFormer Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid says he has submitted his papers to FIFA along with former FIFA deputy general secretary Jerome Champagne and Platini.\nZico, the former Brazilian World Cup player, has said he wants to stand but it is not known if he has been able to receive the necessary support.\nFIFA has been rocked by the U.S Department of Justice's decision on May 27 to indict 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives in a corruption investigation.\nSwiss authorities are also investigating FIFA while FIFA's Ethics Committee has handed out several bans.\n(Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Ian Ransom )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:14:01.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
