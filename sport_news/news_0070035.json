LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina will try to play in the NL division series wearing a splint to protect his injured left thumb.\nThe All-Star catcher met with a hand specialist on Monday and it was determined that a ligament injury hasn't healed. He'll test the splint in workouts the next few days.\nMolina was hurt on Sept. 20 making a tag at the plate and hasn't played since then.\nGeneral manager John Mozeliak said Molina was feeling stronger and added he was optimistic the 33-year-old would be on the postseason roster.\nBackup Tony Cruz would be the starter if Molina is unable to play.\nThe Cardinals on Friday night will host the winner of the wild-card game between the Cubs and Pirates.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
