Barnes played with Odom at different times as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers over the past decade.\nOdom was Carter’s teammate in Dallas for a third of the 2011-12 season.\nOdom, 35, was found unconscious at a brothel in rural Nevada a week ago and was transported to Las Vegas, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.\nThe Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, said workers saw him drink alcohol and take herbal sexual-enhancement supplements. He regained consciousness and communicated for the first time last Friday.\nThe Los Angeles Times confirmed Odom’s release from the Las Vegas hospital.\n“I’m happy for him. He’s a great guy,” Carter said. “We had a great time together. He’s very personable and very friendly. Everything that’s been said about him is true. He’s a team-first guy and I’m glad he’s got an opportunity to go home.”\nThe Times reported that Odom would likely stay at the home of his estranged wife, reality TV star Khloe Kardashian, as he continues to make what has been described as “miraculous progress.”\n“It’s great,” Barnes said. “Anytime you have a near-death situation it’s a wake-up call. Lamar’s a great guy. I know he has a good support system around him now. He’s one of the best guys I’ve ever met. Everyone struggles with personal demons off the court. He is no different. His was just in front of the world. Everyone has a certain opinion about him but everyone who really knows him knows that he’s a great guy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:31:36.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
