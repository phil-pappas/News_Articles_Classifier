LOUIS -- John Lackey came out ahead in a pitchers duel Friday night, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs 4-0 at Busch Stadium to take Game 1 of the National League division series. Lackey worked 7⅓ shutout innings, giving up 2 hits. Lester also worked 7⅓ innings. He gave up a run in the first inning and another in the eighth on a solo homer by pinch hitter Tommy Pham. After Lester walked Matt Carpenter, Cubs manager Joe Maddon turned to reliever Pedro Strop, who promptly gave up a 2-run homer to Stephen Piscotty. Lester was charged with 3 runs. The Cardinals got off on the right foot quickly. Piscotty doubled with one out and came home on a single by Matt Holliday. Lackey did not allow a Cubs baserunner until Kyle Schwarber walked with one out in the fourth. Kris Bryant ended the inning by grounding into a 5-4-3 double play. The Cubs' first hit was a ground single up the middle by Addison Russell leading off the sixth. The Cubs could not get him around. David Ross was called out on strikes, a call Ross did not like by home-plate umpire Phil Cuzzi. Lester grounded out, and Dexter Fowler flied out to the wall in right field to end the inning. Schwarber led off the seventh with a bunt single to the left side. But Bryant struck out and Anthony Rizzo grounded into a 3-6 double play to end a possible threat there. All the while Lester pitched well for the Cubs, shutting down the Cardinals after the first inning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:09:49.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
