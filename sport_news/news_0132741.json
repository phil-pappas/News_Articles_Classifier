Even Terry Collins doesn’t know yet.\nThough the Mets manager would prefer to start Noah Syndergaard, Collins said he may need to give the 23-year-old additional rest after Syndergaard’s first career relief appearance on Thursday night and start southpaw Steven Matz in Game 2 instead. \nThough Syndergaard threw just one inning in Game 5 against the Dodgers, the right-hander warmed up multiple times before entering the game. Matz, who has made just seven career starts, was one of the few Mets players working out Friday at Citi Field, throwing and running sprints.\n“[Syndergaard’s] last time he pitched, the second day he was still pretty sore,” Collins said Friday. “Of all the guys, I’m certainly well aware that I got him up four times [Thursday] night. You could almost say he got ready four times. That could have almost been five innings of work because I knew he threw over 100 pitches warming up. So if he’s still tender [Saturday,] he’s probably not going to be the Game 2 guy.”\nEven if Syndergaard has no issues, Collins — who has faced unending questions and criticism this season about the workload of his young pitching staff — said that doesn’t guarantee he will start. Including Triple-A, Syndergaard has pitched 187 innings this season after throwing 133 innings in 2014.\n“If Noah comes in and he says, ‘Look, I feel great, I’m ready to go,’ we’ve got to decide are we overdoing it by pitching him or should we just say, ‘Look, listen to him, believe in him and pitch him,’” Collins said. “Those are all the decisions that make it hard when you try to take care of your pitching the way we think we’ve tried to take care of ours.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  noah syndergaard ,  steven matz ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:37:43.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
