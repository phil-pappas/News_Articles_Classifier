Some observations are more specific to a particular play, while others have more of a long-range viewpoint.\nThe Patriots blew out the Cowboys because they made much better offensive adjustments as the game went along. Defensively, they had no issues against an undermanned Cowboys offense, but credit every player in the group for playing well, particularly Jamie Collins, Devin McCourty and Jabaal Sheard.\nSTRATEGICAL ELEMENTS\n1\nEver wonder how Tom Brady’s sneaks work? He stepped to the line of scrimmage in the second quarter and noticed an opening over center David Andrews and shouted, “Alert! Alert!” to change the play before quickly diving ahead for the 1-yard touchdown. It was such an easy score that Andrews even dove into the end zone untouched.\n2\nCornerback Byron Jones did a nice job on Rob Gronkowski throughout the game, but he had a ton of help. In coverage, when Gronkowski was in tight or the slot, Jones almost always had a linebacker providing inside leverage with a double team. But the first-half pass rush was significant, too, because there were a few plays when Gronk broke free around the same time Brady was hit or pressured. The Cowboys’ entire operation worked together.\n3\nGreg Hardy probably was the best player on the field in the first half, but he tired a bit in the second half. Still, the Patriots used more double teams on Hardy and Tyrone Crawford after halftime. It involved a combination of Gronkowski, Michael Williams, Dion Lewis or the guard to aid the tackle.\n4\nOne solid way to slow down the pass rush: Brady, in the shotgun, pitched left to LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard run in the first quarter. That’s a seldom used play that should be incorporated more in those situations.\n5\nBrady’s first throw of the second half set the tone for the rest of the way. He delivered a decisive dart on a back-shoulder play for Gronkowski, who easily shielded cornerback Jones, threw Jones and J.J. Wilcox to the ground and gained 33 yards. It was more confidently executed from start to finish than any passing play of the first half.\nPROTECTION WOES\n6\nNate Solder allowed two sacks (Hardy, Crawford) and two quarterback hits from Hardy. Solder was injured on the final drive of the first half when he was engaged with Crawford. As Crawford swam inside Solder, the left tackle stuck his right arm out as an attempt to hold Crawford, but it bent awkwardly. Solder immediately pulled himself out of the game.\n7\nHere’s the rest of the damage. Andrews allowed Rolando McClain’s sack and an additional pressure. Marcus Cannon allowed Hardy’s strip sack and a quarterback hit. Sebastian Vollmer allowed a Crawford sack and Hardy quarterback hit.\n8\nThere were two key short-yardage failures on the Patriots’ part. Blount lost 1 yard on third-and-1 in the second quarter when Josh Kline and Gronkowski couldn’t win their blocks as the Cowboys loaded up the left side of the offensive line, which made sense because the Pats love running left behind Solder and Gronk. And on fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter, the left side of the line again broke down, including Cannon failing to block anyone, when Blount ran for no gain.\n9\nThere were some strong instances of run blocking, but two stuck out. Andrews and Tre’ Jackson teamed up to spring Lewis for 6 yards in the second quarter, and Gronkowski set the right edge and Shaq Mason pulled around to lead the way for Blount’s 34-yard run in the fourth quarter. Mason showed his athleticism with some impressive downfield speed on that play.\nCOVERAGE STATS\n10\nHere’s how Brandon Weeden fared when targeting the following: Malcolm Butler (1-of-4, 17 yards), Tarell Brown (3-of-3, 33 yards, illegal hands penalty), Logan Ryan (1-of-3, 3 yards, interception), Justin Coleman (1-of-1, 13 yards, illegal contact penalty), Devin McCourty (0-of-2, pass breakup), Patrick Chung (1-of-3, 6 yards, PBU, defensive holding penalty), Jamie Collins (3-of-3, 25 yards, forced fumble), Jerod Mayo (2-of-2, 26 yards), Rob Ninkovich (0-of-2, PBU) and Chandler Jones (0-of-1, PBU).\n11\nButler’s four targets were against Terrance Williams, who has been the Cowboys’ top wideout in Dez Bryant’s absence. Butler followed Williams for the majority of the game, but it wasn’t an exclusive assignment. Williams beat Butler soundly on a double move during the final play of the game, but Weeden missed him in the end zone to snap Butler’s streak of three consecutive games allowing a touchdown.\n12\nChung’s sole completion allowed was a 6-yarder to Jason Witten on third-and-11, and his pass breakup occurred in the end zone. Statistically, Chung has been the Pats’ best player in coverage this season, allowing three completions on 10 targets for 21 yards, one touchdown, one pass breakup, one pass interference and one holding penalty.\n13\nWeeden was the worst quarterback the Patriots have faced this season. He completed 10 passes on check-downs near the line of scrimmage against soft zone coverages, which was essentially by design for the Pats.\n14\nAll three of Brown’s yielded completions were against Cole Beasley. Brown also quickly read a bubble screen to Lucky Whitehead in the second quarter to make a stick for a 3-yard loss.\n15\nJones’ pass breakup drew the most attention, but Ninkovich dropped into coverage a handful of times and did well. The Patriots used some 3-4 elements in their base defense with Jones, Ninkovich, Sheard and Dont’a Hightower on the edge. That was expected with a season-high five defensive tackles on the 46-man roster. Look for more of the same against the Jets in two weeks.\n16\nThe Patriots threw the kitchen sink at Witten, using Collins, McCourty, Chung, Jordan Richards and a series of other looks against the tight end. They singled, doubled and bracketed him, and there were plenty of chips at the line, with Sheard handling many of those duties.\n17\nCollins read a dump-off to Joseph Randle in the right flat for a 3-yard loss in the third quarter. Collins ran full speed and swallowed a helpless Randle.\nPRESSURE STATS\n18\nSheard again was the Patriots’ most disruptive player up front with two sacks and a quarterback hit. He also was flagged for defensive holding for an extended chip against Witten. Sheard didn’t draw an offensive penalty for the first time this season.\n19\nHere are the rest of the pressure stats: Hightower (sack), Jones (pressure, drew holding penalty), Collins (drew holding penalty, had a sack negated by Sheard’s hold), Ninkovich (pressure) and Dominique Easley (pressure). It was Easley’s first pressure stat of the regular season. Collins wasn’t asked to play downhill as much in this game as the previous three.\n20\nSheard and Collins each had one run stuff (tackle at or behind the line of scrimmage). Sheard has four this season, including one every game, and Collins is the only other Patriot with two run stuffs.\n21\nDespite a season low in run stuffs, the Patriots held the Cowboys to three runs of 1 yard and five runs of 2 yards. Hightower (one solo tackle, one assist), Easley (one solo), Alan Branch (one solo), Chung (one solo), Sealver Siliga (one solo), Jones (one assist), Malcom Brown (one assist), Collins (one assist), Ryan (one assist) and Mayo (one assist) were credited with those stops. Brown handled himself well, which is impressive given the quality of the Cowboys’ offensive line.\n22\nHightower went down in the first quarter when he was trying to tackle Randle from behind, and Collins drove Randle to the ground on top of Hightower, who immediately knew he injured his ribs.\nMAKING PLAYS\n23\nIn a key stretch by the goal line in the third quarter, Branch fought through a block to stop Darren McFadden for 1 yard on second-and-5. On the next play, McCourty snuffed out a designed play in the left flat for Witten, who lined up inside Williams and submarined Williams’ pick against Butler, which was also designed to swallow McCourty. But McCourty beat the block and stopped Witten 2 yards shy of the sticks, which led to the field goal that made it 20-6.\n24\nJulian Edelman was more productive over the middle than outside the numbers for the second straight game. He caught three passes over the middle for 61 yards and one catch for 59 yards outside the numbers, though that was the biggest play of the day as the long touchdown broke the game open.\n25\nLewis’ 10-yard touchdown reception will be one of the plays of the season because he evaded four tacklers, but his 13-yard scamper on third-and-1 shouldn’t be overlooked. Lewis broke one tackle and dodged another in the backfield to set up Brady’s sneaking score.\n26\nThis might be an example of Lewis being in opponents’ heads. He caught a pass in the right flat in the third quarter, stopped, did a 1-jump step to freeze and shake Jeff Heath for a gain of 7 yards. Defenders don’t appear to enjoy their meetings with Lewis in space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:51:30.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
