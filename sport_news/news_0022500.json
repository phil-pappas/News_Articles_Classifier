(Image Source: Matt Rourke/AP Photo) \nNew York Giants game balls and dudes for Week 6: \n* Game Balls \n-- Jayron Hosley filled in for Prince Amukamara and actually turned in a decent performance with an interception and two passes defended. Hosley never seemed to be out of position and was definitely one of the few positives from this game. \n-- Plenty of people thought Brandon Meriweather would be a liability when the Giants signed the veteran safety in August. Instead, he’s been as solid and as reliable as any other defender. Meriweather had an interception, six tackles and a bone-crunching hit on Jordan Matthews that broke up a completion. \nDuds \n-- Marshall Newhouse played well a few weeks ago at Buffalo but since then he’s struggled. No one on the offensive line played well as Manning was sacked three times and was called for multiple intentional grounding penalties due to all the pressure he faced. With that said, Newhouse was especially bad as he let Connor Barwin look like Reggie White while getting called for a couple of penalties. What is going to happen when he goes against Cowboys’ defensive end Greg Hardy next week? \n-- The hero from last week’s game is definitely one of this week’s goats. Larry Donnell’s blunder in the first quarter clearly changed the course of the game. With his continued up and down play, the Giants truly need to consider if Donnell is worthy of being the starting tight end. Will Tye has played well in limited action and he just seems like the more reliable player at this point. \n-- Not discussed to this point has been Rashad Jennings , who was involved in two plays that gave the Eagles momentum. On the Giants’ third drive, they were faced with a third and short and a fourth and short. Even though the stretch play to the left was a poor call, it looked like Jennings had a chance to cut it back inside where there was some daylight. He did not and the Eagles took over on downs. In the second quarter, Jennings caught a screen pass but was stripped of the ball and the Eagles recovered the fumble. The Giants defense got the ball back with an interception but Jennings’ fumbled killed a promising drive when the game was still close. \nTo more New York football insider news be sure to check out the new NUC at NFLDraftBible.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:59:22.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
