Backup Thomas Greiss was 2-0-1 with a 2.64 goals-against average and a .925 save percentage. \nThe Western Conference-leading Sharks came at 4-0-0, one of two unbeaten teams in the league. \nHalak, 38-17-4 with six shutouts and a 2.43 goals-against average last season in his first year with the Islanders, left New York’s preseason opener on Sept. 21 after two periods and had not played in a game since. \nDefenseman Thomas Hickey also made his season debut. He was injured in a preseason game on Sept. 28 against Washington and was expected to miss up to four weeks. \nForward Eric Boulton was placed on injured reserve with a lower-body injury.
