The Dolphins are preparing for an NFL football game against the New York Jets at London’s Wembley stadium on Sunday. (AP Photo/Tim Ireland) Quarterback Ryan Tannehill was even asked to to imitate the sound of a dolphin and he nailed it with an impeccable squeal.\nHe was less enthusiastic when quizzed on whether he can throw a football 103 yards, the height of Big Ben (the London clock, not the Steelers quarterback).\n“No,” he said. “Good luck finding someone that can throw it 103 yards.”\nPhotos: Miami Dolphins in London to face Jets But for all the fun and excitement which included landing in London on Friday morning, checking in to their hotel and shuttling straight to practice at the Allianz Park rugby stadium, the Dolphins also understand what’s at stake.\nThey enter the London game for a second consecutive year at 1-2, although it didn’t feel quite this dire last season.\nAt least in 2014, the Dolphins opened up with an impressive win against New England.\nMiami has shown little fight this season and hasn’t had an impressive game yet.\nBack-to-back losses to Jacksonville and Buffalo — a 41-14 game that was the worst home opener in team history — has already put a damper on a season that opened with so much promise.\nNow the Dolphins “host” the New York Jets in London, the NFL’s first overseas divisional game.\n“We’re super embarrassed with the way we played last week,” receiver Kenny Stills said. “We want to come in and get that nasty taste out of our mouth.”\nThe Dolphins have often looked lifeless this season and some players this week have been downplaying the poor start.\nTannehill said they have to keep their cool but they’re as upset as anyone about the first three games.\n“I think there’s intensity, there’s urgency and we’re not happy about how we’ve played,” he said. “We understand we have to play better. But I don’t think throwing things or saying outlandish things is going to change anything. It’s a matter of how we handle ourselves day to day, how we prepare. That’s what ultimately is going to win us games.”\nIf the Dolphins escape London with a much-needed win, they’ll likely have to do without left tackle Branden Albert.\nAlbert is doubtful to play on Sunday with a hamstring injury.\nHe missed last week’s game and his replacement, Jason Fox, allowed three quarterback hurries.\nCoach Joe Philbin — who could be on the hot seat if the Dolphins lose to the Jets — expressed faith in Fox.\n“I thought he was solid, I really did,” Philbin said. “I thought he did a good job.”\nTannehill, who was sacked twice in the loss to Buffalo, said he didn’t think the offensive line played as poorly as is being portrayed.\n“I thought the offensive line did a pretty good job,” he said. “That was a really good front we played last week. They kept me off the ground for most of the day.”\nEven if the line wasn’t the main culprit in last week’s loss, the Dolphins have a ton of issues heading in to the Jets game.\nThey’re tied for 27th in the NFL in rushing and are second-to-last in rushing attempts. They’re also the league’s second-worst team at stopping the run.\n“Everyone kind of feels like our backs are against the wall,” Stills said. “We’re going to go out here and play and with everything we’ve got.”\nIn addition to Albert’s absence, the Dolphins will have to play without backup tight end Dion Sims, who was carted off the field with a concussion in Week 1 and hasn’t played sense. He didn’t travel to London.\nTight end Jordan Cameron (groin) and running back Jonas Gray (calf) are questionable.\nThe Dolphins decided to arrive in London on Friday morning despite the minimal time they’ll have to adjust their bodies to the five-hour time difference.\nMiami arrived at the same time last season and defeated Oakland 38-14 although this year’s game is being played three and a hour hours earlier — it’ll kick off at 2:30 p.m. in London, 9:30 a.m. in South Florida.\nThe Jets also arrive to London on Friday morning, one hour earlier than the Dolphins.\n“It’s kind of what we did last year and it seemed to work out OK,” he said. “Sometimes coaches are creatures of habit.”\nTannehill hopes that the familiarity helps the Dolphins. They’re staying at the same hotel from a year ago and they have experience in London that the Jets lack.\n“The whole trip has been very, very similar to what we did last year,” Tannehill said.\nThey just hope they can mirror last year’s result and put the disappointing early season behind them.\n“We have high expectations for ourselves,” Tannehill said. “Coming off two tough losses where we didn’t perform well — it’s a big game for us. There’s no other way to say it.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/275/img/photos/2015/10/02/fa/a6/Britain_Dolphins_Football.J_10.JPG", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/02/3a/40/Britain-Dolphins-Footba-2-.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:27:18.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
