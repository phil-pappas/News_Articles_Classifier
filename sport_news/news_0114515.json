(Photo: Dale G. Young, Detroit News) \nEast Lansing — As Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio began to steer his program’s focus toward Saturday’s matchup against Indiana, it was difficult to put what happened last weekend against Michigan to rest.\nThe game’s hero, redshirt freshman safety Jalen Watts-Jackson, is back on campus but still hasn’t spoken to the media after having surgery on his dislocated hip. He did reunite with most of his teammates on Monday evening, Dantonio said.\n“The man, the legend,” Dantonio said at his weekly news conference Tuesday, “He is back.”\nMoving on won’t include Watts-Jackson, at least for the rest of this season. It does, however, mean the depth chart continues to shuffle.\nAfter earning their first career starts against Michigan, freshmen safeties Khari Willis and Grayson Miller were No. 1 on the depth chart with Demetrious Cox back as one of the starting cornerbacks. Junior cornerback Darian Hicks (concussion) is questionable to play this week, Dantonio said.\nDantonio added that true freshman cornerback Tyson Smith will play this week. It would remove his redshirt, something that could also happen for cornerback Josh Butler. Dantonio added both are working with the second team but Smith is slightly ahead of Butler at this point.\nHe retiterated his plan to only play a true freshman if they were going to play a key role, including on special teams.\n“They should be playing significant plays if we’re going to take the redshirt off of them,” Dantonio said.\nRunning back Madre London also will “probably” be back, Dantonio said. He joined LJ Scott, Delton Williams and Gerald Holmes as co-starters on the depth chart.\nmatt.charboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:41:26.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
