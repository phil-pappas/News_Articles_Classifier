Brad Davis found him wide open near the top of the arc where Clark lined it up and punched a low-skidder back inside the left post. \nMartins' tying goal was a reactive header from in front of the goal, redirecting the first bounce off Andreas Ivanschitz's corner. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:44:15.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
