Playing in the Big Ten, you just feel a lot more sore after the games each week.\" \nThe Buckeyes came into the Maryland game at Ohio Stadium off of a performance in which the defense had to play nearly 100 snaps in order to finish off a goal-line stand and seal a 34-27 win over the Indiana Hoosiers in Bloomington two weeks ago. \nAlthough defensive line/assistant head coach Larry Johnson had to adjust practice plans to rest certain players, the Buckeyes got in the necessary work required to beat the Terrapins in front of more than 107,000 fans on homecoming. \n\"He had to take a few reps off of me in practice this week because I played so many last week, but I felt great out there,\" Washington said. \"I didn't play that many snaps, but I felt like I could've played more. As the season goes on, the Big Ten is very physical, and you need to be 100 percent, as close to 100 percent as you can be when you go out there. We're definitely trying to get the lead up so we can rest the starters.\" \nSenior linebacker Joshua Perry added, \"We had 93 gradable plays, 99 including penalties, and I had seven on special teams. The big thing that we do is 2015 is the year of sports science and the year of all that kind of stuff. Our strength coaches are doing everything. They've got Kryo-tanks that guys go to. I'm going to try the float tank, which is supposed to kind of reset you and get you ready to go. We're starting to get a little bit of a rotation in the LB room. Now that we've gotten that confidence, we've built up a rotation.\" \nWhile the Buckeyes have allowed each of the last two opposing quarterbacks to rush for more than 100 yards, the senior leaders on defense know their teammates have the right focus as they head into this weekend's home game against Penn State. \n\"The mindset of this team is just to continue to get better and better every week,\" Washington said. \"I feel like we're moving in the right direction. That's what Coach Meyer and the coaching staff wants us to do, so that's what we're going to keep doing.\" \nPerry added, \"We played really, really hard. The effort was there and the energy and the demeanor was, and I think that's big. That's something we take pride in. Obviously, we wish would've played a little better. I saw that we gave up quite a few rushing yards and the quarterback probably had the majority of them. That's something we're definitely going to have to work on, and I know our coaches our going to have the answer. \n\"Just keep playing, and that's the one thing. Our coaches probably get a little more flustered on the sideline and probably press a little bit more than the players do just because I think we trust each other so much that we know all we have to do is go back on the field and get another chance. That's one of the great things that we do, just trust in one another to go out there and make plays.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RONpcK TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:09:18.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
