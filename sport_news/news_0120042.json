Because I am certain that if you did see it, the plate umpire would have ruled the play dead the way Dale Scott, a veteran of 30 major league seasons, did. \nFor those who have not seen it: With the score tied at 2 and Texas second baseman Rougned Odor on third, Toronto catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the pitcher hit the bat of Shin-Soo Choo. The ball dribbled down the third-base line, Odor broke for home, and Scott quickly, if not immediately, ruled the play dead. \nSomehow though, the play came back to life a few minutes later, after Texas manager Jeff Banister - who said later he was involved in a similar play as a minor league catcher - pointed out the rule. The umpires convened and counted the run, even though technically Odor crossed the plate after time was called. \nThis induced both a protest of the game by the Blue Jays and some impressive littering by the fans in Toronto, who had been littering all game and really didn't need any more reasons. \nFrom the second inning on, these fans repeatedly stopped play by tossing things onto the field, into the Texas bullpen, even harassing the Rangers' dugout. They were repeatedly described as \"passionate\" by the broadcasters, a phrase repeated in the MLB.com account of the game and several others, and by now you should know where I am going with this. \nAll together now: \nCan you imagine if this occurred in Philly? \nYou think we'd be described as passionate? \nMe neither. \nAs for Hamels, even the most unforgiving Phillies fan - you know, those ones who so often confused his flakiness with a lack of mettle - would concede that he gave the Rangers every thing they bargained for in making that trade last July. Hamels didn't lose over his last 11 starts down the stretch, when the Rangers needed every one of those victories to nail down a playoff berth. He battled a lineup Wednesday that is the most potent in baseball, one that had produced 140 more runs than the Rangers had during the season, and despite three infield errors made consecutively in that seventh inning, walked from the mound still ahead. \nA few pitches later, Jose Bautista lasered a home run so hard off the left-centerfield fa√ßade that it nearly rolled back to the infield, and that was that. Impressive yes, but this game was really decided by gloves: Toronto's infield turned several sparking plays to quell rallies, and Texas' infield fueled its demise with an inning that would make a Little League coach cringe. \nThroughout it all though, Hamels battled. \nThere were no pouts, no histrionics on the mound after his infielders coughed up hairball after hairball. Even after he was relieved, almost mercifully, by Banister, Hamels sat on the bench and watched stoically, the camera zooming in vain for any sign of self-pity or selfishness. \nThis was no Curt Schilling with a towel over his head as Mitch Williams spray-painted over one of his masterpieces. \nStill only 31, it left me wondering if the Rangers may get the best years of his career, his natural maturation coming while his stuff is still A-1. \nI remember a conversation I had with David Cone late in his career, when he was beating batters with his guile pitching for Toronto and the Yankees, after his much of his dynamic stuff had left him. \"I wish I had this head with that arm,\" he said, referencing his more volatile beginnings with the Mets. The Hamels of Wednesday night and down the stretch appeared to have both. \nAnd when it was over, Hamels spoke only glowingly of his new team, about all it had been through this season, about an exciting future that lay ahead. \nIf you didn't like the guy before, you should now. \nAnd if you still don't, I would suggest strongly that it's not about what's wrong with him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:06:20.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
