He's determined to prove to people that he's really that guy.\"\nAnd the pitcher (who prefers to be called \"Thor,\" as do we all) told Dewey, yeah, he did have a chip on his shoulder:\n\"I love pitching in Vegas, I love living in Las Vegas — the atmosphere is unbelievable — but it's not the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is to pitch in the big leagues.\"\nSo there's an answer.\nWhile Thor was here, he tweeted his love for Vegas, especially restaurants such as Ferraro's (\"So amazing went back 2 nights in a row!\")\nAnd he's a representative of his generation, because he does not suffer trolls online. Back in the spring, he told a hater on Twitter:\n\"I really hope you don't reproduce\" (which is something I have said to a few people in my day).\nAnd to another: \"I'm sure you call in sick to your pathetic 9-5 job all the time. Or you might not even have one.\"\nThis Thor guy has baseballs.\nBLOOD RAVE\nJust in case you're not in your concert years anymore, I thought you'd like to know what a blood rave is, especially since electronic act Crystal Method, which arose out of Las Vegas a decade before the Killers, just played a concert for a blood rave in New York.\nA couple of weeks ago, Maxim magazine detailed the correct accoutrements to wear at a blood rave (vampire costume, $130 prosthetic fangs), which is meant to mimic the bloodbath of bloody techno music dancers in the Wesley Snipes vampire movie, \"Blade.\"\nOnly near the end of the New York blood rave did event staff pour red paint on everyone.\n\"Definitely not for me,\" one blood raver was Quote: d.\nIf this sounds like your cup of tea, then fly over to Amsterdam for a Halloween staging of the blood rave, minus Crystal Method but with music acts named Pump Panel and Bram Fidder. The Oct. 31 blood rave has already signed up 5,000 potential partiers on Facebook ( https://m.facebook.com/events/119185328427294/ ) at a secret location.\nBRA BATTLE\nI'm not going to lie, my eyes got caught by the name of this event, \"Battle of the Bras.\"\nPlanet Hollywood and host Jeff Civillico, the local entertainer, will host \"Battle of the Bras\" on Thursday to raise money for the American Cancer Society, by auctioning bras designed by employees and local entertainers, including Donny and Marie Osmond.\nSadly, Donny and Marie are not among dignitaries signed up to model bras on a catwalk. Instead, bras will be flashed by Planet Hollywood executives (really?), \"senior leaders\" (cool), and stage stars from topless-friendly \"Absinthe,\" \"X Burlesque\" and \"X Rocks\" (that makes more sense, however the execs and seniors thing sounds more interesting).\nThis is the sixth year. Last year's bra battle picked up $50,000 for the charity.\nSECOND-TIER REALITY STARS ALMOST MADE A VEGAS SHOW\nIn the old days, it was the Howard Stern show that got all the scoops and insights. Now it's podcasts such as \"The Nerdist\" and \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\"\nOn episode \"#704\" of Rogan's podcast, comedian Alonzo Bowden said Vegas execs almost staged a resident show comprising a bunch of reality-TV stars.\n\"They wanted to do a reality-stars thing in Vegas. I was going to host it, because I won 'Last Comic Standing,'\" Bowden said. \"They couldn't get the big 'American Idol' winners and stuff like that. It was all the second-tier reality shows.\"\nI'm guessing that these days, they'd have an easier time getting the \"American Idol\" and \"Voice\" winners on the same bill, considering how they're selling individually.\nRogan (who does stand-up in MGM's Ka Theatre on Dec. 11) said Bowden was better off that the show didn't happen.\n\"I think your world gets weird if you live there\" in Vegas, Rogan said. \"I love Vegas. I love working there. I love doing the UFC there. But I love getting the (expletive) out of there just as much as I love getting there.\n\"If you had to choose between living in Vegas and living in Toledo, I'll take (expletive) Vegas every (expletive) day of the week, no offense Toledo, but you know what the (expletive) I'm saying.\"\nRogan thinks there's something weird about living in a city where people come to \"get crazy.\" Which is the reason I like being here. I hate living in boring places where people don't get weird and crazy every hour of the day. Carpe diem, and all that. But then, Rogan has kids. Who raises kids in Vegas? (I'm just messing with you, parents.)\nAnyhow, Bowden digs Vegas for combining the best and worst of America.\n\"If somebody came from another country, they're like, 'I want to see America, I've got five days,' we're going to Vegas,\" Bowden said. \"Because you get the buffet at Circus Circus, and you see the American hillbilly in his natural environment. And you go to the Bellagio, and you see the beautiful millionaires.\n\"That's the thing I love about Vegas,\" Bowden said. \"If you watch the Strip, you will see the craziest collision of cultures: 'Is that a pimp talking to a Kansas City grandma?'\"\nDoug Elfman can be reached at delfman@reviewjournal.com .
