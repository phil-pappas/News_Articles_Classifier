The two deputies were fired last month, and The Post obtained the disciplinary letters Monday.\nThey are among four deputies fired since the first of the year.\nChristopher Pratt, a nine-year department veteran, was on unpaid leave in June 2014 when an upstairs neighbor stomped on the floor after being annoyed by loud music from Pratt's apartment, according to a Denver Department of Safety discipline letter.\nAdvertisement DOCUMENT: Read Deputy Pratt's disciplinary letter.\nPratt, who was dressed in civilian clothing, went upstairs and pounded on the door repeatedly, saying \"you'd better open this door,\" the letter said.\nA resident, identified only as Mr. CM, opened the door and Pratt flashed his badge and stuck a finger in the man's face, saying that if he ever stomped on the floor again, Pratt would have him arrested for domestic violence.\nWhen the man asked if Pratt was threatening him, the deputy cut loose a string of insults and expletives, the letter said.\nWhen his neighbor opened the door, Pratt told an Internal Affairs Bureau investigator, he appeared intoxicated. Mr. CM kicked at him, he said.\nAfter the incident he called 911, and in that call he said Mr. CM actually kicked him, the letter said.\nThe investigator asked if Pratt was aware of departmental policy about identifying himself as a deputy sheriff.\n\"I know that I'm not supposed to identify myself as an officer unless I'm on duty or under the scope of my duty,\" he said.\nPratt claimed to have initiated the dispute because he was concerned there was domestic violence going on. \"A preponderance of the evidence indicates that no such incident ever occurred,\" the letter said.\nIn the second case, Robert Roybal, a member of the department for four years, was overseeing the distribution of laundry at the downtown detention center in May 2014.\nDOCUMENT: Read Deputy Roybal's disciplinary letter.\nSurveillance video showed that a trusty, who ran the laundry exchange, performed pat searchers of at least three inmates, as Roybal watched.\nWhen asked about the searches, Roybal said, \"I didn't see it,\" the letter said.\nRoybal violated department and career service rules by failing to do assigned work, the letter said. He also \"permitted the atmosphere to exist and perpetuate wherein the searched inmates were subjected to physical abuse at the hands of the tier porters,\" the letter said.\nIn the third case, Desiree Archuleta, a seven-year veteran of the department, was assigned to the Lindsey-Flanigan Courthouse on July 31, 2014, and on watch during an in-custody murder trial.\nDOCUMENT: Read Deputy Desiree Archuleta's disciplinary letter.\nBoth her sergeant and the presiding judge saw her using her cell phone and another electronic device, the letter said.\nThe sergeant \"observed Deputy Archuleta texting on one phone and scrolling through what appeared to be photographs on the other electronic device,\" the letter said.\nBoth the defendants' and the victims' families were in the courtroom. The sergeant said security in the courtroom was \"as bad as it gets.\"\nFour minutes passed before the sergeant approached Archuleta.\nShe was so startled by his appearance \"she dropped one of the electronic devices,\" the disciplinary letter said.\nDuring the investigation, she admitted that she was looking at her calendar and using one phone as a day planner. She also said she had been web surfing.\nDuring that time, the letter said, she was \"unable to monitor the situation and the multiple potential security threats present.\"\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1013/20151013_120128_Roybal_Letter.PDF", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1013/20151013_120528_Pratt_Letter_Disc.PDF", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1013/20151013_120239_Archuleta_letter.PDF"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:02:00.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
