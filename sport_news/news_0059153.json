The team said he had an ankle injury. He said he'll be fine. He's fumbled four times this season, losing three. \nGetting benched was doubly tough for Gordon, who played at Wisconsin before being drafted No. 15 overall by the Chargers (2-4). 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:08:10.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
