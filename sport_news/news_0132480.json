The demand comes against the backdrop of Akal Takht’s flip-flop over pardoning Sirsa dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who allegedly dressed up as Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh guru. Didar Singh Nalvi, senior vice-president, HSGMC, said: “Sikh high priests are passing ‘Stone Age edicts’ against members of the community as norms have not been laid down.” The committee of the Sikh intelligentsia, comprising retired judges of High Courts and the Supreme Court and vice chancellors, should be constituted to lay down norms, under which members of the community members can be punished or pardoned, he said. “Any member of the community should be first summoned and allowed a chance to explain his conduct and then he be punished by high priests if a substantial case is made out against him or violating the ‘Sikh maryada’,” Nalvi said. He expressed apprehension about Sikhs being excommunicated or pardoned at the whims and fancies of a selected few, acting as per dictates of their political bosses in Punjab. “This will dent the religious authority of the high priests. A set of norms will ensure ‘justice’ to members of the community.” The HSGMC senior vice-president sought the 15-member committee should write down rules for the appointment, emoluments, qualification and tenure of Sikh high priests. “The committee should not only be empowered to interfere in the working of the high priests, but it should also act as body which will hold the high priests accountable to laid down norms. This will ascertain the present-day crisis is not repeated,” he said Nalvi said the committee would free the high priests of political interference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:24.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
