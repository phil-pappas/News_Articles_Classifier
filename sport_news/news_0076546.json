Steve Chapin, SJA head coach, said there was no doubt the prolonged layoff--the Saints went nine days between matches--left them rusty, especially in their serving, which was uncharacteristically putrid. “We hit a lot of balls into the net, especially in game four, and that was my frustration.” Still, “you have to give credit to Blue Earth; we played well, (but) Blue Earth handles the easier balls really well, and you have to give them something with purpose and tempo to get them on their heels,” he said. The Buccaneers also have a lot of height, “but that didn’t bother us too much; they got us a few times, but we weren’t consistently getting blocked.” Madi Carlson had a particularly strong match, with 12 kills and 14 digs, made all the more impressive by the fact she’s battling “a little bit of a pinched nerve thing in her back,” Chapin said. “She had a really good match tonight.” The match started with a spike from Julia Beckius, which drew a “good start” comment from Chapin. A superb dig by Amelia Collier eventually led to a point and a 5-5 tie. A Carlson kill made it 9-6, an ace from Nora Schmidt stretched the lead to 11-7, and a kill by Allison Brandts after a setup from Desirae Mortenson put SJA ahead 14-7. A pair of aces back-to-back provided the Saints a 22-15 lead, and Brandts found the perfect spot to deposit a winner and conclude the opening stanza. The Buccaneers spurted to leads of 3-0, 5-1, and 8-4 in the early moments of the second game, but Brandts fed Mortenson for a furious kill to pull the home team within three. BEA’s Lindsey Norman shot right back to make it 12-8. At 16-9 in favor of the visitors, Chapin used a timeout, but it was to no avail, as BEA ran off three more points. SJA crept within three, however, after two consecutive aces by Beckius, but a winner by BEA’s Alissa Norman delivered the game to the Buccaneers. In the third game, it was the Saints who ran out to an early lead, 6-1, but the Buccaneers battled back to seize a 9-8 advantage. Sublime team defense by the Saints, including a rare “pancake” (where the hand is flat on the ground) by Brandts, led to the home team evening the score. “That is a very difficult play to make,” said Arica Otte, SJA assistant volleyball coach. “Many people play volleyball their entire lives and never perfect the ‘pancake!’” Page 2 of 3 - Jerry Lee Lewis will forever be “The Killer” in the music industry, but that moniker is reserved for Beckius, SJA’a all-time career kills leader, on the volleyball court, and she performed her magic on two straight points to give the Saints a 17-13 advantage. On a set by Collier, Mortenson delivered the winner that ended the game. BEA’s Kaylor Jacobs brought the heat and gave her squad a 9-6 lead in the fourth game, but a kill from Brandts brought the Saints within striking distance at 13-10. The best rally of the match to that point--with terrific offense and defense by both teams--ended with Brandts pulling SJA within 15-11. BEA ran away and hid again, however, seizing a 20-12 lead. The Saints refused to capitulate, however, rallying to within 23-20, but Brandts failed to get a ball over the net, forcing a decisive fifth game. First blood went to the visitors on Samantha Ripley’s kill, and BEA went on to a 4-1 lead. A beautiful shot by Ripley made it 5-3, but a rare ace for the Saints, by Beckius, pulled SJA back within a point. Both teams were now razor sharp, going all-out on every point, and Mortenson tied the game at eight. Carlson’s serve then put the Saints ahead and forced a BEA timeout. Mortenson found the soft spot in the defense to make it 12-9, and Beckius brought the crowd to their feet with a winner that made it 13-9. The crowd was louder at this point than at any other in the match; it was almost as if they had a premonition the match would go the distance, and they were saving themselves for the fifth and final game. With the crowd awakened and on fire, SJA pushed across the finish line in the marathon match, snagging the school’s 600th volleyball victory. Beckius led the team with 20 kills and 19 digs. Mortenson had 12 kills, Collier had 38 assists, and Brandts enjoyed a fabulous all-around game--10 kills, 13 assists, and 15 digs. The Saints also spotlighted cancer Friday night, with lots of pink both in the crowd and among players--many of the players wore pink headbands. Chapin spoke about the impact of cancer before the match, calling it “a never-ending battle,” and there was a moment of silence for all those who have died of cancer. In a tournament at Pipestone October 10, the Saints went 1-2, finishing fourth. They beat Edgerton, but dropped matches with Pipestone and Southwest Minnesota Christian. SJA invaded St. Peter Monday night and emerged with a 25-21, 25-21, 25-19 victory. Beckius had a team-leading 10 kills, while Carlson led the team in digs with 12. Collier had 15 assists, and Brandts had 11 assists. The Saints travel to Fairmont Monday at 7:30 p.m. Page 3 of 3 - Ryan Anderson can be reached at randerson@stjamesnews.com and followed on Twitter @randerson_ryan By Ryan Anderson   By Ryan Anderson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:36:08.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
