A budget hotel with a perfect sight line to the medical facility was offered hundreds of dollars by an entertainment outlet to station a crew in their parking area. \nReporters were camped out through the night, with nothing much to tell, but no shortage of people to tell it to. \nBecause the Odom situation is one of those moments where the public’s thirst for information and the methods by which it is obtained create an uneasy mix. \n“For the last few days a lot people around here were hoping all the trucks and everything would leave,” said Erica Ramos, 26. “But then you’re kind of conflicted. If they leave, it might mean he is dead.” \nOdom is a former NBA Sixth Man of the Year award winner and a two-time world champion, yet the majority of the news media here have come from the entertainment world, with Odom married to Khloe Karsdashian, who, along with and other members of reality TV's first family, were at the hospital. \nOne TV reporter quizzed a man who had left the hospital after visiting Odom earlier in the week about how many members of the Kardashians had been in the room with the former basketball player. Afterwards, the reporter turned to colleagues to ask who the interviewee has been. It was Rev. Jesse Jackson. \nGALLERY: LAMAR ODOM AND THE KARDASHIANS Lamar Odom and then-wife Khloe Kardashian arrive at the Philippe Restaurant West Hollywood grand opening in Oct. 2009.
