McNulty threw for 131 yards and a touchdown on 11-of-21 passing, while Smith threw for 70 yards after connecting on 3-of-11 for 70 yards with an interception.\n\"Andrew McNulty is our starter,\" UNT coach Dan McCarney said. \"I was really disappointed in the consistency of DaMarcus Smith when we did give him an opportunity. He does have talent, but the attention to detail is something he needs to make major, major improvement on. If he does then he has a chance to contend for the top spot. If he doesn't, we will get what we saw the other night.\"\nMcCarney said UNT has no plans to play Smith this week.\nBriefly: Middle linebacker Blake Bean is expected to return to UNT's lineup Saturday after missing two games with a shoulder injury. Bean has 22 tackles on the season.\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-06T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:24:15.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
