The Cavaliers lost to Wooster, 33-24, South Kent, 30-25, and Watkinson, 34-21. \n“It was a beautiful campus on a beautiful autumn day, but with hills comprising about 80% of the course, we found it to be a challenging race,” said Harvey Coach Mike Lauria. \nFinishing in first place was Clay Hoadley of South Kent at 21:06 . John Coleman of Watkinson was second with a time of 22:01 . \nHarvey’s top runner was senior captain Rohan Cassell, who finished in third place with a time of 22:28 . Senior Jovell Forsythe finished in 11 th place at 23:27 while sophomore Nathan Ward followed right behind in 12 th place with a time of 23:28 . Senior team captain David Solano finished strong with a time of 26:01. \nAlthough Harvey did not have enough girl runners to count for the race, captain Julia Mallon of Katonah, still testing the waters after an injury, ran a determined and impressive race with a time of 29:23.
