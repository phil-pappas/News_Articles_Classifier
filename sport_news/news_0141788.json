Col. James Yarbrough with the Coweta Sheriff’s Office said Thursday. The Newnan Times-Herald was the first to report on the Monday assault at a Sharpsburg home.\nWhen the girl’s mother returned home, Payne was on top of the child, Yarbrough said.\n“She came in on what he was doing, and she hit him with some type of bowl,” Yarbrough said. “He punched her, too.”\nPayne ran outside with only a T-shirt on and tried to run from deputies, but he was caught and arrested. Payne was charged with rape, aggravated assault, sexual battery, sodomy and child molestation, Coweta jail records showed.\nPayne likely wouldn’t have been able to hide for long. Most of his face is covered in tattoos, his booking mugshot showed. And before the picture was taken, Payne was required to remove numerous piercings, Yarbrough said.\nAt the time of his arrest, Payne was on parole after serving two years in prison for a burglary conviction, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections. He also served time from February 2004 until May 2007 and again from November 2010 until March 2012 for other convictions, including aggravated assault, burglary and theft, records showed.\nPayne was being held without bond Thursday at the Coweta jail.", "external_links": ["http://www.times-herald.com/Local/20151007-Juvenile-Rape-8-inches-w-mug"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:33:34.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
