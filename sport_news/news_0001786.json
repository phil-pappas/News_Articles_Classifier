McAdoo played first varsity hoops game on Friday night. Bryant McAdoo is a two-sport standout at Cardinal Hayes . He starred at wideout for the Hayes football team and plays forward on the Cardinals' basketball team.\nThe 6-4 junior is quick to call football his No. 1 priority, but there's no denying that basketball is in his blood.\nMcAdoo is a distant cousin of Bob McAdoo , an NBA Hall of Famer who won the 1973 Rookie of the Year award and the 1975 MVP with the Buffalo Braves . He won two championships with the Lakers (1982, â€˜85) and also played for both the Knicks and Nets in his 14-year NBA career.\nBryant played as a reserve forward as Hayes hosted Holy Cross on Friday night, his first varsity game for the Cardinals.\nMcAdoo blocked three shots and went scoreless in Hayes' 70-59 loss, but first-year coach Joe Lods expects bigger production; McAdoo had practiced just eight times - the minimum required by the CHSAA to play in a game - before his debut.\n\"I expect him to be a major contributor for us,\" said Lods, who witnessed the Harlem resident's strong athletic ability during football season and was eager to get McAdoo in uniform.\nDuring football season, Lods would bump into McAdoo in the cafeteria and \"just give him a look,\" the coach says.\n\"He knew what I was thinking,\" Lods said. \"It was all about the countdown (to basketball season). Twelve days, nine days, eight days ...\"\nMcAdoo had four touchdown catches in six regular season games at wideout, but saved his best performance for the Mount-Cardinal Hayes annual Thanksgiving Day game, in which his 60-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter sealed Hayes' first Turkey Day win over Mount in 28 years.\n\"He's a tall, sure-handed receiver,\" said C.J. O'Neil , the Cardinals' football coach. O'Neil says that McAdoo is a sure-fire Division I football prospect.\nPace for News Bryant McAdoo plans to play football in college. McAdoo visited UConn over the weekend and said he plans to play football in college.\nMildred McAdoo proudly showed off her grandson's report card after the game on Friday night. McAdoo maintains an 88 average and has made the honor roll at Cardinal Hayes in every marking period.\n\"The football accolades are nice, but I'm so proud of him for his grades,\" Mildred said.\nBryant has never met Bob McAdoo, but Mildred says that her grandson has been encouraged to play basketball by other members of the family.\nHis uncle, Norris McAdoo Jr. , was a standout player at Power Memorial HS and St. Raymond HS in the early 1980s. Norris was well known in city basketball circles; born without a right hand, he used only his left and still managed to excel on the court.\nBryant followed the footsteps of his brother, Djuane Barmore , onto the football field and into Cardinal Hayes. Barmore played two seasons at Hayes.\nYou might think that with all of his family ties to the playing field, Bryant would suffer the burden of unfair expectations. But that's not the case.\n\"It feels great,\" McAdoo said. \"I love hearing my name.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:20:13.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
