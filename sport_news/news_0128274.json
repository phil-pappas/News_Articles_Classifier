Yesterday’s competitive focus was on her championship fours race in the New York Athletic Club boat, where she finished second. Her Saturday race, however, was a special occasion, the parent-child double with her mother Christine .\n“It was her belated 60th birthday present,” Lofgren, who finished 16th in the coed field of 40 with her mother, said. “It’s a long race, and she hadn’t raced in 20-plus years, but it’s neat to go out there and have that family experience among everything else.”\nNo matter how focused her prep for next summer’s Games may be, Lofgren will always find time for this regatta.\n“I can see my college friends, I can see my U.S. Rowing teammates, and I can see my high school teammates,” Lofgren said. “We call it Rower Thanksgiving.”\nRacing For Joan\nEven after 35 years, the 1980 Olympic rowing team that missed its chance to compete at the Moscow Games is a close-knit group.\nSeveral members of the men’s and women’s teams make the Head of the Charles a regular agenda item, but this year 24 gathered to race in honor of late teammate and 1976 Olympic silver medalist Joan Lind Van Blom .\nVan Blom, the first American Olympic medalist in rowing, lost her battle with brain cancer in late August. An inspirational figure in the American rowing community, she had continued to race while ill, even participating in last year’s Head of the Charles.\n“She was an icon for women’s sculling,” Carol Brown, a former teammate of Van Blom, said.\nBrown and her fifth-place team in Saturday’s women’s senior masters eights raced donning “For Joan” shirts, and convinced the 1980 teammates in the men’s senior master eights and fours to do the same.\nSpecial pairing\nThe adaptive inclusion double race was included in the Head of the Charles for the first time.\nThe race, which pairs an able-bodied athlete with one who has a disability, was included as an exhibition event. Long term, the goal is to create a third race for differently abled athletes in the schedule.\nSix boats competed. The title went to Community Rowing’s Alexandria Chrumka and Johanna Beyer . . . .\nAndrew Hashway became the third consecutive winner from Cambridge’s Riverside Boating Club in the master’s men’s singles (30-plus), winning in 18:55.829. . . .\nJamestown, R.I.’s Eliza Kallfelz , who recently finished 10th at the junior world championships, won her second Head of the Charles title in women’s youth singles. Just like last year, Kallfelz won by a large margin, this time finishing 27 seconds ahead of the pack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:22:03.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
