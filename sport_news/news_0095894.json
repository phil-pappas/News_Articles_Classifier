(Photo: Rod Sanford | Lansing State JJournal) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJourdan Lewis got the last word, a pass break-up with Connor Cook targeting Aaron Burbridge for the 19th time Saturday and putting a first-down pass right in his hands on third-and-19 from the Michigan 45. \nLewis was trailing but was able to reach out and slap the ball away before Burbridge could secure it. After U-M pressure and a Cook incompletion on fourth-and-19, it was Michigan’s game to win. Then it was lost on the final play. \nBut that was the best game within the game, Burbridge vs. Lewis, all day, a tremendous showcase for both players. \n\"Jourdan, he's a good player, we were out there battling -- every play was a battle,” said Burbridge, who finished with nine catches for 132 yards, while Lewis had six pass break-ups. \n“Two great players going at it,” U-M coach Jim Harbaugh said. \n“It was a decision by them to match (Lewis) up on Burbridge,” Dantonio said. “’AB’ did a good job of catching the ball for us and I thought it was a great matchup. … I think the matchup was one of the more interesting matchups of the game.” UPDATED: Best of the web on the best game ever \nThe level of play was high enough within the matchup to be played again on a Sunday somewhere in the NFL. And as the No. 7 Spartans (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) look to Saturday’s game vs. Indiana (4-3, 0-3), they do so with a red-hot passing game. \nBurbridge leads the Big Ten with 44 catches and 702 yards, and Saturday showed MSU will go to him against any opposition. \n“We’re not gonna stay away from the competition or the game-breaker type players,” Cook said. “I know the plays that Burb can make and I was just throwing the ball out there for him to make them.” \nWarm welcome : Lewis also impressed with his tweet Monday to Jalen Watts-Jackson, the MSU hero of Saturday’s game who broke and dislocated his hip while scoring the winning touchdown. \nLewis tweeted to Watts-Jackson: “Hope you alright big dawg that was a great play.” Dad: Watts-Jackson's injury not career-ending at MSU \nCook said Monday on the Mitch Albom Show on WJR that Watts-Jackson had been in the MSU football building that afternoon, fresh from his release from U-M Hospital in Ann Arbor, and that everyone was “giving him a whole lot of love, taking pictures with him.” \nCalling his shot : Cook also reiterated what Dantonio said on his Sunday teleconference about the pre-game talk Dantonio gave on the first of the team buses as it pulled in to Michigan Stadium before Saturday’s game. Dantonio told the players on his bus and had assistants tell players on the other bus to sit quietly for 10 seconds and think of what needed to be done to win. \nThere were exactly 10 seconds on the clock before MSU’s winning play. \n“He’s like a prophet almost,” Cook said. \nBefore the winning play, Cook said MSU quarterbacks coach Brad Salem said on the sideline that MSU was going to block the punt and Cook responded: “Yeah, OK, all right.” Podcast: Spartan Speak, U-M game reaction \nCentury mark : Dantonio got a game ball for his 100th victory as a head coach, on a night that saw him improve to 82-31 in his ninth season with MSU. He has won 33 of his past 36 games. \n“I’ve had a lot of coaches that have been with me for 12 years, three in Cincinnati, then nine years here,” Dantonio said. “Harlon Barnett, Mike Tressell, Mark Staten and Dave Warner (starting with the final year at Cincinnati). So we’ve had a lot of guys that are involved in that and it’s really what I believe is a program win, not just for myself but for all the assistants as well that have been with us.” \nAnd it was accompanied by some Dantonio dancing, as video that surfaced Monday showed. \n“I’m just in the mob with everybody else,” Dantonio said. “All you’ve got to do is toss your fingers up and down a little bit and you’re good.” Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1LHu7VJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:18:25.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
