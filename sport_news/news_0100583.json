Its matchup with then No. 4 Michigan State on Oct. 10 drew 50,373 fans, which was a little more than 2,000 shy of the stadium's 52,454 capacity.

(Video by Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nRutgers sold out Big Ten games against Penn State, Michigan and Wisconsin when it averaged a program-record 50,632 fans for its six home games last season. \nSaturday's matchup with No. 1 Ohio State will be the seventh sellout since Rutgers expanded its stadium in 2009. \n\"Saturday night will be the best atmosphere in all of college football,\" Flood said. \"Anybody who's ever been to a prime time night game at High Point Solutions Stadium will tell you that. The country got a little glimpse of it a couple of weeks ago when we played Michigan State, and I think it will be amped up even a little bit higher this week with the No. 1 team in the country coming to town.\" \nRELATED: Kyle Flood expects raucous atmosphere for Ohio State \nUsing its dynamic pricing model, Rutgers was charging its highest single-game ticket prices for the Ohio State matchup . Tickets ranged from $175 to $550 when Rutgers put them on sale over the summer. \nSecondary ticket broker StubHub had tickets available in nearly every section ranging from $85-575, as of Wednesday afternoon. \nThe game against Ohio State will be broadcast nationally by ABC. In an email announcing the sellout, Rutgers urged fans to be in their seats early. \n\"ABC goes live at 8 p.m. — be heard and be seen,\" the release said. \nFlood said players notice when the stadium is full early. \n\"When you're coming out for warm-ups and the stadium is just about full and the student section is full – they're elevating the emotional level of everybody in the program,\" Flood said. \"So there's no question they're a tremendous advantage for us at home.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:11:56.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
