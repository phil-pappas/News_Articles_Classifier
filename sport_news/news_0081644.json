Papelbon is a relief pitcher.\nAdvertisement The disagreement apparently sparked when Harper jogged towards first base as he was out via a routine fly ball. There was speculation that Papelbon was unhappy with the lack intent and effort shown by Harper on his way to first.\nAs Harper walked off, out, the two began yelling at each other before Papelbon grabbed his teammate around the neck and the physical fighting began.\nHarper didn't take the field in the ninth, but Papelbon did. When he was eventually pulled (he gave up five runs in a poor appearance), the fans booed him from the field.\nThe Nationals gave up eight runs in the ninth inning before eventually losing the game 12-5 to the cellar-dwelling Phillies.\nAfter the game, Papelbon reportedly apologised and said he was the one in the wrong. Harper apparently accepted the apology, saying he didn't care and the situation was \"like brothers fighting\".\nIt has been a poor season for the Nationals, with talk that their manager has lost the players. The team was eliminated from playoff contention on Sunday (AEST).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:48:49.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
