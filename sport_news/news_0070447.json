School officials said Monday that he cleared a \"rigorous\" background check. A creepy college coach who’s been charged with sexually abusing his players cleared a “rigorous” background check despite his supposedly pervy past, school officials said Monday.\nKurt Ludwigsen, 44, was fired from Nyack College in March, after several members of the softball team approached school administrators to say he'd been grabbing their breasts, slapping their buttocks - and even licking their ears, court papers say.\nThe married dad was hit with almost 200 related criminal charges a month later.\nIn lawsuits filed in White Plains Federal Court on Friday, three players said he never should have been hired by “New York’s Christian College” in the first place.\nThey noted that “publicly available information” showed Ludwigsen had been the subject of a “criminal investigation for sexual assault and sexual harassment” while coaching another team in California in 2013, and that he'd been running a paid phone service that connects porn stars like Bree Olson and Allie Haze with their fans, which should have been a red flag. Ludwigsen “was certainly not a typical Christian coach,” the suit says.\nIn a statement Monday, the school said, “All faculty and staff hired by the college are subjected to a rigorous background check including a check of sex offender databases.” Nyack College personnel have “fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities,” school officials said.\nSouth Nyack-Grand View Police Kurt Ludwigsen is set to stand trial next month. The players’ suits say the school should have known what was going on, especially since Ludwigsen once brought “Star Wars XXX: A Porn Parody” star Haze to the school to give the team a “life coaching” lesson.\nHaze said she was surprised to see her name brought up in the suit, because she'd considered the sitdown a “positive experience.” The “Emmanuelle” star said she'd met Ludwigsen at a porn convention where he was pitching his phone service in 2012.\nShe said her “work acquaintance” didn't seem like the type of person who would do the types of things his players have accused him of, but “if something happened without their consent, that's not okay. More power to them for speaking up and not staying silent. I'd encourage any woman to speak up.”\nLudwigsen has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and is scheduled to stand trial next month.\nThe school declined further comment citing the pending litigation, and said, “we continue to keep those impacted in our prayers.”\ndgregorian@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Nyack College softball coach hit in sex harass suit NY softball coach accused of forcibly touching players", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:06:06.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
