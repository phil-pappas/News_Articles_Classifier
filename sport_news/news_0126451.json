Posted: Saturday, October 17, 2015 10:45 pm \nALLENDALE — Northern Michigan has two girls golf state champions. \nOne team and one individual. \nTraverse City West rallied in a big way to forge a tie with Rochester atop the Division 1 standings at 685. The tiebreaker was each team's fifth scorer, and West won based on Grace Warren's two-day total of 193. \nThe Titans' Anika Dy finished second overall in D-1, shooting a two-day total of 156 with a final-round 77 Saturday at Grand Valley State University's The Meadows. She was one shot behind Brighton's Julia Dean. \nWest improved its score by 11 shots the second day. \nIt's TC West's first state title in a sport other than skiing since taking the Division 1 boys soccer crown in 2006. The Titans won girls skiing crowns in 2007, 2012 and 2015. \nGlen Lake's Nichole Cox won her second consecutive Division 4 individual championship. \nWest started the day in fourth place, five shots behind Rochester. \nThe first year with live scoring made for an extra-nervous day for Titans coach Kristen Nolan. Only the Division 1 event had live scoring. \n\"Our place kept fluctuating,\" Nolan said. \"We were in first, then fourth, then we were second and all over. It was driving me crazy. It was sort of a love-hate relationship with it.\" \nWest — a team without any seniors — was more poised Saturday, Nolan said. \n\"The girls were not as nervous as (Friday),\" she said. \nWarren's 193 score was much lower than Rochester's fifth scorer, which was a combination of two golfers' first and second rounds and amounted to a 264. \n\"Being only five shots behind, I knew we had a chance,\" Nolan said. \"It's very surreal. It's crazy. We were not even ranked in the top 10 in the state.\" \nThe Titans did win Big North Conference and regional championships, in addition to the state title. \nHunter Kehoe cut seven strokes off her first-round score to card an 80 Saturday. \nGrace Ellul was a shot better than Friday, and Maddie McCall shaved four off her opening-round score to card a 93. \nWarren shot rounds of 94 and 99. \nAll four Titan counters bogeyed the 18th hole, but Kehoe had a birdie on No. 17 — her fourth of the tournament. \nSaturday's round was even colder than Friday, steady in the mid-to-upper 40s throughout, Nolan said. It wasn't as windy early on, but picked up later. \nBloomfield Hills was third at 692, with Troy (693), Novi (696) and Saline (697) the only other teams to break 700 in the 15-team field. \nCox shot a second-round 74 for a two-day total of 150 to win the Division crown by a half dozen shots over Frankenmuth's Meg Watkins at Michigan State University. \nThe junior led by two strokes after the first day and added four shots to that lead. \n\"It's hard to defend your title,\" Lakers coach Paul Christiansen said, \"and she did it.\" \nCox finished third as a freshman and won each of the last two years. \nManistee finished 13th in Division 4 with a total of 840. The Chippewas were led by Fallon Gates (88-84—172), Makenzie Wittlief (109-99—208), Katie Huber (113-109—222) and Michelle Ball (126-112—238). \nPetoskey's Grace Kelbel shot a two-day 171 as a Division 2 individual qualifier at Battle Creek.
