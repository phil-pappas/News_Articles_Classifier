MALC will try to get on track By DANIEL McKILLOP The Daily News MohaveDailyNews.com | 0 comments \nBULLHEAD CITY — The Patriots have run into two buzz-saws in as many weeks, and the Mohave Accelerated Learning Center football team will try to get in the winning column at 7 tonight at Firebird Field against the North Pointe Falcons. \nThe Patriots fell 47-7 to Scottsdale Christian on Sept. 18 and 45-0 to Tonopah High School on Sept. 25. \nThe Patriots are 1-5 overall and the Falcons are 1-4 overall coming into the Arizona Interscholastic Association Division V football game. \n“They’re a spread team,” said Patriots head coach Steve Price about the Falcons’ offensive scheme. “I’m getting tired of these spread teams.” \nScottsdale Christian and Tonopah each used spread formations. \n“I think they’re pretty much 50-50 run to pass,” said Price about the Falcons’ offensive tendencies. \nThe Patriots’ first-year head coach said the Falcons play a 4-4 defensive formation. \n“They’ve got a little size,” Price said, “but at this point everybody looks like everybody has a little bit more speed than we do — more team speed, we’ve got some individuals who can run like deer, but not overall team speed. \n“That will be a good matchup for us tomorrow.” \nPrice said Clay Merrigan, who has done a “good job” moving from free safety to running back, had a “good week” at practice. \nJackson Werchau “has really started to pick it up” this week, Price said. \n“I think, overall as a team, we’ve picked up at practice this week and the intensity of it,” Price said. “So, I’m more excited about that than anything else at this point.” \nPrice added: “It’s a tough schedule; it’s not an easy schedule. We’re doing our best to get on the right track and do some positve things.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:56:50.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
