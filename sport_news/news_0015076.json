There have also been suicide attacks near the capital, Abuja.\nOverall, some 1,350 people have been killed since Buhari came to power at the end of May, according to an AFP tally.\nBuhari said on Wednesday that Boko Haram's \"ability to attack, seize, ravage and hold any Nigerian territory will have been completely obliterated\" by December.\nThis week, he met the head of the US Africa Command, General David Rodriguez, as Washington announced the deployment of up to 300 military personnel to northern Cameroon.\nThe US military will provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance expertise, the White House said, after similar multiple suicide attacks in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.\nGuerrilla-style tactics against \"soft\" civilian targets such as mosques, markets and bus stations have increased.\nLast week, 41 people were killed in triple explosions in Baga Sola, on the Chadian side of Lake Chad, where Nigeria meets Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\nOn Friday, Nigeria's most senior army officer, Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, told troops \"the next few days will be crucial\" in the counter-insurgency.\n\"It is also crucial to our country, Nigeria. Our sovereignty as a nation is threatened. The Nigerian Army and indeed the military as the symbol of our nationhood is being challenged.\n\"Our ability to stand and defeat the Boko Haram terrorists in the next few weeks will determine the future of our country. We cannot afford to lose the fight,\" he said.\nThe greater sense of urgency may be attributed to fears of a resumption of attacks in hard-to-reach rural areas of northeast Nigeria once the rainy season ends.\nShould that happen, troops attempting to secure towns and cities would face overstretch to tackle the Islamists in the countryside.\nThe repeated attacks on Maiduguri, however, demonstrated the difficulties in combating the threat to urban areas.\nIn Mulai, NEMA's Kanar and witnesses said the bombers appeared to have slipped into the mosque disguised as worshippers before evening prayers at 6:30 pm (1730 GMT).\n\"When rescuers and sympathisers gathered in front of the place, the second one went off, killing many of them,\" said Amadu Marte, a civilian vigilante assisting the army.\nMarte said he and colleagues counted 42 bodies at the scene.\nFriday's attack in Umarari, a village of mainly poor farmers and labourers some seven kilometres (4.5 miles) west of Maiduguri, also happened at a mosque shortly after 5:00 am.\nWitness Dawud Baana said worshippers were preparing for morning prayers at the time.\nStreet vendor Saratu Garba said she heard the blast as she was carrying firewood out of her house and that 19 were killed.\nBoko Haram has a track record of attacking mosques, considering places of worship that do not share its radical interpretation of Islam as a legitimate target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:13:23.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
