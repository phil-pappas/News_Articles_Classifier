With time running out, the Big Red drove 53 yards to set up a first-and-goal from the 10, but four consecutive incomplete passes by Robert Somborn turned the ball over on downs and Colgate ran out the clock. \nColgate (1-3) owned the first half, building a 21-7 lead at the break as Melville connected with Alex Greenawalt for a 12-yard first-quarter score and hit John Maddaluna for a 17-yard touchdown. Melville's 2-yard run in the third made it 28-7. \nCornell (0-3) got a 27-yard touchdown pass from Somborn to James Hubbard at the start of the fourth and Hagy's 1-yard plunge with 4:03 left made it 28-21. Hagy had 121 yards on 11 carries, including a 79-yard touchdown run. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:28:17.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
