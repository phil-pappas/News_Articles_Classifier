That helped a lot, too. I was out there playing freely, just getting out there and doing things I normally do, and that helped carry over.”\nIt’s no secret the Nets need Lopez to be an All-Star for them if they have any hope of reaching the playoffs for a fourth straight season. If training camp was any indication, it looks as if that’s at least a possibility.\nHere are a few other takeaways from training camp:\nBig Bargnani Andrea Bargnani may not have many fans in the tri-state area after his two-year stint with the Knicks, but don’t be shocked if he begins the season as the Nets’ first big man off the bench.\nLionel Hollins appears to be a fan of Bargnani, who the Nets coach said has been a “breath of fresh air” and can play alongside any of the team’s big men. That includes Lopez, who Bargnani played next to for long stretches of the portion of Friday’s scrimmaging that was open to the media. It’s a combination Hollins is interested in seeing in action.\n“Offensively, those guys are very versatile and they give a lot of problems to the defense, because both can shoot, both can pass, and both can put the ball on the floor,” Hollins said. “I like those guys playing together at times.”\nWhether the pairing will work defensively is another matter entirely, but Hollins appears committed to giving it a shot.\nStarters set Although there was some thought during the summer that Joe Johnson could wind up coming off the bench this season, it appears the Nets have a starting group of Jarrett Jack, Johnson, Bojan Bogdanovic, Thaddeus Young and Lopez to begin with.\nThat lineup obviously could have some defensive issues — particularly on the wings, where neither Johnson nor Bogdanovic is a plus-defender — but it seems the Nets will give it a chance to begin with the option to put in a better defensive presence there (either Wayne Ellington, rookie Rondae Hollis-Jefferson or Markel Brown) if it doesn’t work.\nBrown out Speaking of Brown, he has been forced to miss significant time for a second straight preseason after suffering a moderate left oblique strain Thursday. That will make it difficult for him to crack the rotation early on this season.\nOutside of Lopez, the biggest strength for the 2015-16 Nets is wing depth, and with Johnson, Bogdanovic, Ellington and Hollis-Jefferson all likely locked into places ahead of him, it could be a while before Brown gets a chance at regular minutes once he gets healthy.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under andrea bargnani ,  brook lopez ,  brooklyn nets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:45:49.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
