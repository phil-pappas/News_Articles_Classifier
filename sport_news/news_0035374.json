We've got to go play for play, point for point. Now the challenge is on us to do that.\"\nThat's going to be tough for a Wake Forest program that for the second straight year is riding its defense while the offense matures.\nThe Demon Deacons have perhaps the youngest team in the country, with only five players in their fifth season in the program.\nThe offense has five freshmen or redshirt freshmen listed as starters — and that's not counting the uncertain situation at quarterback, where sophomore John Wolford and freshman Kendall Hinton remain listed as co-starters and are fighting various injuries.\nConversely, the defense starts one true sophomore and four seniors or graduate students.\nSo while the offense continues to try to find its legs, a defense ranked 15th in the nation, allowing 296 total yards per game, is once again carrying the load.\nAnd that sometimes makes for ugly wins.\nIn a bizarre stat, Clawson is 2-1 in ACC games in which the Demon Deacons fail to score a touchdown.\nThey beat Virginia Tech 6-3 in double overtime last year for Clawson's first ACC victory, a game that was scoreless at the end of regulation.\nThen something similar happened last week in Boston during what safety Ryan Janvion called \"the craziest ending I've ever been a part of in my Little League, high school, college career.\"\nBoston College came up empty on two possessions inside the Wake Forest 10-yard line in the final 2 minutes, fumbling the first with 1:09 to play.\nThe Demon Deacons' Matt Colburn coughed the ball up three plays later with 56 seconds remaining. The Eagles had first-and-goal at the 1 with 29 seconds left, but ran a play for no gain and time expired before Jeff Smith could spike the ball.\n\"People call it an ugly game,\" punter Alex Kinal said. \"I don't know, if you know football I guess it wasn't so ugly, if you watched the defense.\"\nThere's a pretty good chance the Tar Heels will find the end zone: North Carolina averages 38.6 points and 471 total yards, both ACC bests. Since that befuddling 17-13 loss to South Carolina in the opener in Charlotte, the Tar Heels haven't been held to fewer than 38 points.\nClawson wants the Demon Deacons to find a way to get another victory.\n\"This is a year that you've got to fight, compete, scrap and find ways to get wins and, at times, steal wins,\" he said.\n___\nFollow Joedy McCreary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joedyap", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/joedyap"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:17:36.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
