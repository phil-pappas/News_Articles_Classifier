He hoped to visit the Portobello Road Market to buy antiques, but can’t fit it into his schedule. Marshall, it turns out, is an antique collector.\n“I’m an antique guy,” Marshall said. “I collect antiques. So every time I get a chance, I’m always looking over there. It’s cool. You guys should do it if you have free time. It’s like a festival.”\nHis favorite antique?\n“I have a 1940 doctor’s bag,” he said. “That’s pretty cool. So that’s my thing now, collecting bags, antique bags. I’ve got an 1800s bag. Some cool stuff.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under antiques ,  brandon marshall ,  london ,  new york jets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:07:04.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
