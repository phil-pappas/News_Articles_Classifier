Photo: Jay LaPrete /Associated Press Spurs Nation: Beat writers gaze into their crystal ball 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Express-News staff writers make their predictions for the 2015-16 NBA season:\nBUCK HARVEY\nSpurs 2015-16 record: 57-25 — There will be bumps. There will also be nights when LaMarcus Aldridge blends so well the Spurs look like the league’s best. And little of it will matter until April.\nAtlantic Division winner: Toronto — Destined to be first in the division, destined to lose in the first round.\nCentral Division winner: Cleveland — David Blatt shows improvement after a season at the right hand of LeBron James .\nSoutheast Division winner: Atlanta — Assuming he left his sore calf behind in San Antonio, Tiago Splitter becomes a quiet, underappreciated factor in the East.\nPacific Division winner: Golden State — If Steve Kerr remains the only one in the franchise who suffers an injury, the Warriors will be a top-two seed.\nSouthwest Division winner: Houston — While the Spurs will slowly reform the way they play, the Rockets will plug in Ty Lawson and go faster.\nNorthwest Division winner: Oklahoma City — Billy Donovan is blessed to begin his NBA coaching career with this roster. He’s also blessed to be in this division.\nEastern Conference champion: Cleveland — They don’t even have a clear-cut challenger within the conference.\nWestern Conference champion: Oklahoma City — Finally free of injury, the talent rises.\nNBA champion: Oklahoma City — Kevin Durant gets a ring, as well as a reason to stay.\nRookie of year: Jahlil Okafor — Tanking nearly over, Sixers direct their offense to an NBA-ready rookie.\nDefensive player of year: Anthony Davis — Voters will be reluctant to see the Pelicans star as the MVP, since standings are often tied to the award. So this will be his consolation prize.\nMVP: LeBron James — Still the game’s best.\nJEFF MCDONALD\nSpurs 2015-16 record: 61-21 — Offseason additions of LaMarcus Aldridge and David West will help the Spurs better navigate the grind of the regular season and return them to the 60-win club.\nAtlantic Division winner: Toronto — The Raptors remain the cream of a dreadful crop, but they’ll have to hold off a Boston team on the rise.\nCentral Division winner: Cleveland — The Cavs won 53 games in the first season of LeBron James’ homecoming. Take the over this year.\nSoutheast Division winner: Miami — With Chris Bosh healthy and the Heat (somewhat) reloaded, look for Miami to return to the playoffs.\nPacific Division winner: Golden State — With a target on their backs, the defending champs will have their work cut out to fend off the improved L.A. Clippers .\nSouthwest Division winner: Spurs — The Spurs gave away the division on the last day of the regular season last year, but cruise with room to spare in 2015-16.\nNorthwest Division winner: Oklahoma City — So long as Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook can stay healthy together, OKC has no strong challenger for the Northwest crown.\nEastern Conference champion: Cleveland — Does any team out East have what it takes to dethrone King James and the Cavs? We think not.\nWestern Conference champion: Spurs — It will be a bloodbath, but the Spurs have the talent plus experience to emerge from a mess of true contenders that includes Golden State, OKC and the L.A. Clippers.\nNBA champion: Spurs — This time, perhaps, Tim Duncan will go out on top.\nRookie of year: De’Angelo Russell — Sweet-passing guard will get plenty of run, playing with the rebuilding Lakers.\nDefensive player of year: Kawhi Leonard — The first wing player in 11 years to win the NBA’s top defensive award, the Spurs’ small forward will make it back-to-back.\nMVP: Kevin Durant — KD comes back with a vengeance after last season’s lost year — just in time to hit the free-agent market.\nTOM ORSBORN\nSpurs 2015-16 record: 56-26 — It’s tempting to predict a 60-win season, but questions surround chemistry, Tony Parker and bench.\nAtlantic Division winner: Toronto — An infusion of youth, including ex-Spur Cory Joseph, keeps them atop NBA’s weakest division.\nCentral Division winner: Cleveland — The mission is simple: secure home-court advantage in the Finals.\nSoutheast Division winner: Atlanta — They won’t win 60 again, but they should be good for the East’s 2 seed.\nPacific Division winner: Golden State — They’re the hunted now, but that shouldn’t stop them from another title chase.\nSouthwest Division winner: Spurs — Toughest team in toughest division.\nNorthwest Division winner: Oklahoma City — Kevin Durant returns to form for new coach Billy Donovan.\nEast champion: Cleveland — Aided by return of Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, LeBron James gets another shot at third title.\nWest champion: Golden State — The Warriors have it all again — talent, depth, coaching.\nNBA champion: Cleveland — In Finals rematch, Cavs gain revenge; James wins MVP.\nRookie of the year: Jahlil Okafor. In a conference thin on stellar big men, he will shine for the Sixers.\nDefensive player of year: Kawhi Leonard — They’ll have to rename this award in his honor by the time he’s done.\nMVP: Anthony Davis — Already a two-time All-Star at 22, he’ll flourish in Alvin Gentry ’s up-tempo scheme.\nMIKE MONROE\nSpurs 2015-16 record: 57-25: It will take time for a revamped roster to develop championship synergy; 60-win season is unrealistic.\nAtlantic Division winner: Toronto —Their core is intact and they added role players who are solid defenders and glue guys.\nSoutheast Division winner: Miami —They’ve had a full year to get over LeBron’s defection; Hassan Whiteside is All-Star waiting to happen.\nCentral Division winner: Cleveland — Opening without Irving will be tough but Mo Williams will hold the fort for team with NBA’s best player.\nSouthwest Division winner: Houston — Ty Lawson just what they needed to take the next step.\nNorthwest Division winner: Oklahoma City: A new coach. A healthy superstar. And a giant chip on collective shoulder.\nPacific Division winner: Golden State —Defending title incredibly difficult but young, talented core is intact.\nEastern Conference champion: Cleveland — LeBron James will get his seventh trip to The NBA Finals because he is that good and his team deeper.\nWestern Conference champion: Golden State — The scary thing about the defending champs is fact they are so young.\nNBA champion: Golden State —What will a fifth loss in a seventh NBA Finals do to LeBron’s legacy?\nRookie of the Year: Kristaps Porzingis\nDefensive Player of the Year: Kawhi Leonard\nMVP: LeBron James\nJABARI YOUNG\nSpurs 2015-16 record: 60-22. Health will play a major role with the Spurs. Anything major may cut this prediction down to about 50-55 wins, but with all that offensive power, this team should have no problem getting 60 victories or more.\nAtlantic Division winner: Toronto — Kyle Lowry dedicated his offseason to getting fit and looks great early on. Add DeMarre Carroll to the mix - that defense should be solid.\nCentral Division winner: Cleveland —The Bulls will be lurking, with the Bucks sneaking up, too, but last I checked LeBron James is still playing.\nSoutheast Division winner: Washington —Carroll’s loss will hurt Atlanta. Meanwhile, John Wall is healthy, Bradley Beal still has a lot to prove, the Wizards are legit.\nNorthwest Division winner: Oklahoma City — Short and sweet: Kevin Durant is back, Russell Westbrook’s play is on another planet. Enough said.\nPacific Division winner: Los Angeles Clippers — Some still believe the Warriors were lucky to win the championship last season. I’m one of those people. The Clippers are deeper and more prepared to take back the division.\nSouthwest Division winner: Houston —This is a dangerous team that shouldn’t be taken lightly. James Harden is a bad man, Dwight Howard seems healthy, and Ty Lawson’s addition will help.\nEastern Conference champion: Cleveland — Again, James is still playing, Kevin Love is back, and if Kyrie Irving stays healthy throughout the playoffs, the Cavs have more than enough to repeat as conference champions.\nWestern Conference champion: Spurs/Thunder —The rules say pick one, but I can’t. It will comes down these two teams (health permitting). Spurs are more experienced, but OKC has always given them problems. Should be a great Western Conf. Finals.\nNBA champion: Cavaliers will get there, and if the Spurs are the opponent, Cleveland will once again suffer disappointment. If it’s the Thunder, LeBron will finally bring one home.\nRookie of the Year: Jahlil Okafor\nDefensive Player of the Year: Draymond Green\nMVP: Anthony Davis\nsports@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/76/8843143/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/76/8843143/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/76/8843144/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/76/8843145/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/20/8762412/19/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/76/8843144/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/20/8762412/19/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/76/8843145/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:46:21.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
