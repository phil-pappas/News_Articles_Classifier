You can have a s— life growing up. You can have a tough upbringing. You can have history. You can have whatever. But, if you are just a bad person, you know what I mean? There's no excuse for that.\"\nSolo acknowledged in her 2012 book that she had a rough childhood. Her mother was an alcoholic, her father was jailed and the family had little money. She also alleged in her book that Chmerkovskiy was abusive toward her in practice, even slapping her across the face at one point.\nChmerkovskiy's jab at Solo comes less than two weeks after a Washington court decided to reinstate her two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence after an appeal was filed when the charges were dropped in January. Solo was accused of assaulting her half-sister and nephew in June 2014.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:54:43.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
