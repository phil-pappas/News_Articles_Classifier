The Sox also announced assistant hitting coach Harold Baines, at his own request, will move into an ambassador role with the team, which will include instruction in spring training.\nThe Sox hope to hire two coaches to fill their roles in the next few weeks, and the rest of Ventura’s staff, including hitting coach Todd Steverson and pitching coach Don Cooper, will return.\n“If we didn’t feel as an organization that Robin had the ability to be a championship caliber manager, he wouldn’t be here,” Hahn said. “If we felt we didn’t have a championship caliber hitting coach, he wouldn’t be here.\n“The people who wear this the most, who lose the sleep over this as much as anybody … want the same things our fans do. It’s important (to) put ourselves in the best position and we feel like we are in that position.”\nWhite Sox GM Rick Hahn on Robin Ventura White Sox general manager Rick Hahn discusses keeping manager Robin Ventura.\nWhite Sox general manager Rick Hahn discusses keeping manager Robin Ventura.\nSee more videos Hahn said the organization considered every option when asked if there was talk of dismissing Ventura.\nEntering Friday’s game against the Tigers, Ventura had compiled a 295-350 career record since being hired without any managerial experience. In that time, the Sox suffered a late collapse to miss the playoffs in 2012 and lost 99 games in 2013, tied for the fourth-most in franchise history.\nBut this year’s debacle, in which the Sox were 74-85 entering Friday, could be the most disheartening after the Sox created high expectations with the offseason additions of pitchers Jeff Samardzija, David Robertson and Zach Duke, left fielder Melky Cabrera and designated-hitter Adam LaRoche.\nDespite the results, Hahn said the environment Ventura has created for his players is among the manager’s strengths and an important quality for a team with many developing players.\nHahn also acknowledged Ventura needs to improve in-game decision-making, using baseball’s wealth of information in the right ways and knowing his players’ strengths. They talked about those topics at meetings this week, including a nine-hour session Monday.\n“Any manager … you’re going to have some tactical disagreements between 7 and 10 o’clock at night,” Hahn said. “We’ve been able to talk through the specific issues and understand the rationale behind them. A big part of the managerial job happens in the other 21 hours, and Robin’s strength is in that communication and in the environment he creates to maximize (players’) abilities.”\nVentura said after Hahn’s announcement it “feels good” to receive the front office’s support. He wants to focus on improving his team’s fundamentals next season, something that went awry often early in the year. He does not expect to be focused on the status of his contract.\n“Right now we are just focusing on what we need to do in the offseason to get to that,” Ventura said. “I’ve always been a person that I honor that contract, and I’m not trying to force anything. … I want us to win more than I’m worried about that.”\nThe Sox already have compiled a list of potential names to fill their staff openings, though former manager Ozzie Guillen is not on that list, Hahn said. Having managerial experience or a Latin-American background to communicate with Spanish-speaking players could help a candidate but isn’t a requirement.\nParent was told his contract wasn’t being renewed after Thursday’s loss to the Royals and won’t coach the final three games of the season. A catcher for 13 seasons in the majors and a minor-league manager after that, Parent joined the Sox when Ventura was hired before the 2012 season, and Ventura said it was tough to part with a friend.\n“Mark is a tremendous baseball man,” Hahn said. “It just wasn’t the right fit.”\nSox catcher Tyler Flowers said he respected Parent’s honesty in their four years together.\n“He had our best interest at heart,” Flowers said. “He’s definitely an outspoken guy, but I enjoy that. He didn’t sugarcoat things. From a player’s perspective, you like to hear honest answers.”\nParent, who hopes to remain in baseball, said he didn’t think he was taking the fall for a failure many share.\n“I’m accountable for what I had to do,” Parent said by phone Friday morning. “I thought I did a pretty good job at this. If it wasn’t enough, that’s fine.”\nckane@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChiTribKane\nPrivacy Policy Chicago White Sox Robin Ventura Don Cooper Ozzie Guillen Detroit Tigers Kansas City Royals", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f027a/turbine/ct-white-sox-rick-hahn-video-spt-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ef513/turbine/ct-white-sox-ventura-returns-spt-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-03T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T19:58:30.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
