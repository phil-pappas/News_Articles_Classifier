He’s getting more and more comfortable off the tee. He drove the ball very well today and played a great round.” \nAfter having three other players placing top-50 at the conclusion of round one, the Bearcats ended the tournament with one other athlete in the top-50 rankings. \nNewsome was tied for 28th place Monday by shooting 4-over par, but finished the tournament tied for 43rd place with a final score of 10-over par. \nAt the conclusion of the first round, the Bearcats were tied with Bowling Green for fourth place out of 14 teams. Martin was pleased with his team’s 11-over par performance to conclude Monday. \n“We’re not very far away from taking the next step,” Martin said. “We’ve got to play with a little more confidence or swagger. Even though our top player didn’t have his best round today, others stepped up and kept us in contention. That’s a positive sign for us.” \nUC did not keep up its steady play Tuesday, as the team finished the tournament in ninth place and shot 28-over par. \nThe Penn State University Nittany Lions, the No. 11 ranked team in the nation, won the tournament by shooting 9-over par, after ranking Monday as the leading team. \nUC will play in their last event of the fall season Sunday through Tuesday, when they compete in the Intercollegiate at the Grove tournament in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. \nThe Bearcats will begin the spring season March 7 at the Colleton River Collegiate tournament in Bluffton, South Carolina.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:36:14.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
