Here we take a look at the biggest stories behind this week's action.\nAdChoices LA MASIA GIVES BEREFT BARCA A BOOST\nXavi departs, Pedro is sold. Lionel Messi is injured and cannot play for two months while Andres Iniesta limps off. These are strange days for Barcelona, which si made to cope with fewer and fewer high-class la Masia graduates by the week.\nFor a team that cannot field any new signings until January, the mounting injuries could have proven to be problematic - especially in light of a malfunctioning youth system which is not capable of bulking out the squad as easily as in previous years. The successive graduations of Carles Puyol, Xavi, Victor Valdes, Iniesta, Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas, Messi and Sergio Busquets are unmatched in football history and it is perhaps inevitable that the well ran dry.\nCrucially, though, Sergi Roberto and Munir el Haddadi came up with the goods when needed. Sergi has been around the Barcelona first-team picture for quite some time without making much of an impact but is playing well as a frequent deputy for Dani Alves.\nHe picked the right time to score his first Champions League goal since December 2011, and only his second overall, when equalizing on a tough night against Bayer Leverkusen. His crucial breakthrough speared the Germans' resistance and gave Barca the platform to go for the kill.\nIt was Munir's piece of magic inside the area which prompted Luis Suarez's late winner, an assist forged in la Masia and evoking a certain No. 10 missing on the night.\nWith Aleix Vidal and Arda Turan ineligible until January, Luis Enrique is relying on homemade solutions to see the club through this difficult period.\nCITY STILL RELIANT ON 'FIRST WAVE' SIGNINGS\nIt seems in 2015 we have come to appreciate Vincent Kompany as a great defender due to his absences for Manchester City as much as his presence in the back line. Since seeing him limp off against Juventus, Kompany's teammates have succumbed to defeats to the Italian champion, West Ham and Tottenham and largely failed to impress again in the Champions League defeat of Borussia Monchengladbach on Wednesday.\nWith Kompany, the club looks unstoppable. However, while Nicolas Otamendi, Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala have indeed struggled to form partnerships in Kompany's absence it is the lack of meaningful impact for City's other recent signings which will cause as much concern for coach Manuel Pellegrini.\nIt was again up to Sergio Aguero to make sure of the points for City, bailing the team out as he did by winning and converting a late penalty.\nKompany was signed in 2008, before the Abu Dhabi money kicked in, David Silva came on board in 2010 with Yaya Toure and Aguero was bought in 2011. Due to the wages City pays, the club doesn't tend to lose many players to better teams as evidenced by the retention of Silva and Aguero, in particular, through the years.\nHowever, that Pellegrini is still wholly reliant on City's 'first wave' signings and the club has not been able to find players of similar impact is both concerning for the coach and an indictment on the team's ability to attract the top names to supplement what is already on the books.\nBig money was spent on this side in the summer, following a period of parsimony due to Financial Fair Play restrictions. While Kevin de Bruyne has looked sharp in the Premier League, with plenty of goals already scored, City still looks incapable of doing the business without its long-standing core.\nBuilding a team to win the league twice has cost the Abu Dhabi group over 1 billion pounds ($1.5B). To make inroads in the Champions League could cost twice that amount unless some value for money is demonstrated.\nSHREWD PORTO DOES IT AGAIN IN THE TRANSFER MARKET\nAlex Sandro, Jackson Martinez and Danilo left Porto over the summer for around $100 million between them. Porto replaced Martinez and Danilo with two free signings in Maxi Perreira and Pablo Daniel Osvaldo. Furthermore, two of last season's key men, Casemiro and Oliver Torres, have also departed for Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid respectively after their loan deals expired. That's at least five of last year's team gone and needing to be replaced.\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that Porto might make a slow start domestically and in the Champions League. Not so. Julen Lopetegui's men followed up their O Classico defeat of arch-rival Benfica a couple of weeks ago with a hugely impressive 2-1 win over Chelsea on matchday two in the Champions League.\nPorto has done it again, showing the way when it comes to not only selling but replacing talent. While Osvaldo has yet to find form or fitness, with his path to the first team blocked by the formidable Vincent Aboubakar, Maxi has slotted in well at right back and is performing at his usual aggressive best. The form of newly-signed midfielders Giannelli Imbula and Andre Andre, who scored the opener here, has meant that Casemiro and Torres have scarcely been missed so far.\nElsewhere Iker Casillas has done well while Jesus Corona will prove to be a shrewd acquisition once he's settled among a broadening Mexican contingent at the club.\nIt will, however, be Yacine Brahimi and Ruben Neves who will lead Porto through its next set of twin objectives; winning titles and being sold for big money. The Algerian talisman is playing the football of his life and has been hugely influential in the Champions League so far while Neves belies his 18 years with performances of increasing confidence and authority.\nBENFICA STUNS SIMEONE AND ATLETICO\nWhile Olympiacos's defeat of Arsenal at the Emirates could be described as a massive shock, the Gunners enter every match with that propensity to do something very 'Arsenal' - such as lose 3-2 to a side that had lost its last 12 games in England. Meanwhile, BATE Borisov was at home while upsetting Roma and Rudi Garcia's ineptitude for coaching tasks in the Champions League - three wins in 20 - is well documented.\nWith that in mind, it was Benfica's overturning of Atletico Madrid at Vicente Calderon which was the biggest surprise of matchday two. Diego Simeone's has recast a previously shambolic side in his own image - organisation, aggression and a distaste for conceding goals.\nAtleti had not conceded one at its famous old ground in this competition since March 2014 and you'd have to go back a year further than that to find the club's last defeat on home soil - February 2013 against Rubin Kazan in the Europa League. All in all the club had won 21 of its previous 24 home European games before Wednesday.\nSimeone has made Atletico a Champions League mainstay as well as a contender for domestic titles but there is a softness in the team's belly of late that belies the fire put into it by the Argentine. The goals the defense gave up against Benfica - which nonetheless deserves immense credit for the manner in which it executed this victory - were lax and bore the hallmarks of slipshod defending. That is very un-Simeone.\nThe defeat came on the heels of a weekend defeat to Villarreal in la Liga, where the team is already off the pace, with Real Madrid to play at the weekend. As subtly as Simeone forged Atletico as one of Europe's finest sides, the side is slipping back down the pecking order and would do well to repeat its 4-0 hammering of its city rival at the weekend.\nLEWANDOWSKI AND PEP BENEFIT FROM CHANGE OF MINDSET\nThe numbers are scarcely believable. Robert Lewandowski has scored 10 goals in his last two-and-a-half games of football. That averages out to roughly two goals per half. He has scored 10 of Bayern Munich's last 13 goals including seven in a row in the Bundesliga in matches against Wolfsburg and Mainz. He has discovered another level - beyond even Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.\nPep Guardiola has set his attack up in a more Lewandowski-friendly way and it has benefited his center forward. The Poland captain was occasionally asked to play left wing last season and was even a substitute to be brought on after a 'false 9' had run the opposition back line into the ground.\nGuardiola, though, has gone back to basics with Lewandowski and has been rewarded not only with a goal flood but better all-round performances from the No. 9. There is nothing revolutionary about his methods either. He has deployed Kinglsey Coman and, especially, Douglas Costa wide of Lewandowski and the 27-year-old has been allowed to gorge on crosses. The stationing of Thomas Muller close to the front line has also helped prevent Lewandowski being isolated.\nGuardiola has found the formula to get the best out of Lewandowski. With Borussia Dortmund to face at the weekend, can he now do the same for Mario Gotze?\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:40:20.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
