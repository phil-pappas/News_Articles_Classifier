Going for goal, he could only watch as his shot aimed towards the upper corner flashed inches above the crossbar. \nThen, about a minute later, Ameti found himself open in the box with the ball at his feet, only to watch his shot sail high for a second time. \nWhen the halftime whistle blew, the score still remained 1-0 in the Golden Panthers favor. Zummo said heading into the second half, it was important for the Golden Panthers to keep up the pressure. \n\"It was real good to make sure we said, we need to maintain the pressure, keep it up, keep up the intensity, the confidence, and that definitely showed cause we had the ball most of the half,\" he said. \nThe Golden Panthers would indeed keep the ball in the Hornets end for large portions of the second, and they would be rewarded with two more goals. \nFirst, it was Ameti finding the back of the net around the 21' minute despite his first half struggles when he collected the ball just outside the box from straightaway, turned, and fired his shot home into the bottom left corner. \nThen, with under five minutes left to go, Thomas tallied his second goal of the game, blasting in from a few yards out a ground cross into the box from the right baseline by fellow senior Liam Lilienthal. \nZummo said Thomas has \"been scoring goals all year.\" \n\"He gets himself in good positions and he's such a big, strong kid that he's able to somehow keep the ball even when it doesn't look like he's gonna be able to and finish,\" he said. \nIn addition to seniors showing up on the offensive side of the ball, it was the same on the defensive side, with senior goalkeeper Billy Troast, who finished with ten saves on the night, leading the way.
