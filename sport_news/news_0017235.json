The SI was arrested along with UT DSP RC Meena and two other accused on August 13 this year. The first regular bail applications of all four accused were dismissed on September 17. Last week, the High Court had also dismissed the bail plea of co-accused Aman Grover and Sanjay Dahuja. While dismissing the bail application of SI Surinder Kumar today, the court stated that, “Keeping in view the gravity of the offence and the manner in which it was designed to be executed along with the co-accused, and the nature of crime, I am of the opinion that if the accused is released on bail, there is an apprehension that he may abscond and there is a reasonable apprehension of witnesses being tampered with or an apprehension of a threat to the complainant as the complainant has already intimated the threat in writing.” “The accused is involved in the case of a bribe of Rs 70 lakh, of which a sum of Rs 40 lakh was to be paid to officials of the Economic Offences Wing for not arresting the parents and brother of the complainant, Guneet Kaur. Another Rs 30 lakh was meant to be given to co-accused Aman Grover to get the compromise effected.There is every possibility that the accused, being a Sub-Inspector, may intimidate the complainant and try to influence the witnesses during the trial if he is released on bail,” said the court. “For these reasons, it is not a fit case for bail. Hence, the second regular bail application of accused Surinder Kumar is dismissed,” said the court. The CBI had strongly opposed the bail application on the grounds that accused Surinder Kumar had raided the houses of the accused without issuing a notice under Section 160 of the CrPC. The entire motive of SI Surinder Kumar and DSP RC Meena was to settle the cases pending between both parties by obtaining the bribe amount, the CBI had said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:07:49.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
