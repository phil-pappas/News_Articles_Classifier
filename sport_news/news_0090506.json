The whole atmosphere changes. The lads will be more confident. The fans will be buzzing,\" he is quoted as saying by The Mirror . \n\"It would be the first win of the season and we really need it.\" \nThe Magpies, who were also winless prior to last weekend, thumped Norwich City 6-2 to ride the crest of a wave into Sunday's contest.
