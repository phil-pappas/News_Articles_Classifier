Miller had two assists and Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves for New York. \nCheered on by a sellout crowd of 22,104, with many dressed in their usual red jerseys, the Blackhawks raised the banner for the franchise’s sixth NHL title during a colorful pregame ceremony. Fluorescent balls bounced around the seats and LED wristbands for the fans provided a synchronized lightshow during player introductions and highlight presentations. \nAll-Star winger Patrick Kane, the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York, heard loud cheers when he skated onto the ice for the Cup celebration. Kane hasn’t been charged. \nArtemi Panarin scored in his first NHL game for Chicago, which is trying to become the first team to successfully defend the title since Detroit in 1997-98. Teuvo Teravainen also scored, and Corey Crawford made 24 saves. \nCANADIENS 3, MAPLE LEAFS 1 \nTORONTO (AP) - Carey Price made 36 saves and Montreal beat Toronto, spoiling Mike Babcock’s coaching debut with the Maple Leafs. \nCanadiens captain Max Pacioretty scored on Montreal’s first shot against Jonathan Bernier a few minutes in for the first goal of the NHL season. Alex Galchenyuk broke a tie midway through the third period, and Pacioretty added an empty-netter. \nJames van Riemsdyk had a power-play goal for Toronto early in the second period. \nBabcock made the first coach’s challenge in NHL history and was successful in overturning a goal. He challenged Jeff Petry’s apparent goal in the second period, arguing that Tomas Plekanec interfered with Bernier. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:09:16.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
