The ball was headed twice before Chance Myers fired a shot on goal. Ricketts blocked the shot with his left foot, but deflected the ball back to Kevin Ellis , who shot went just under the crossbar and into the back of the net.\nFor the Galaxy, Robbie Keane made it 1-1 when he scored in the first minute of first-half stoppage time.\nSports & Recreation Soccer Sporting Kansas City Los Angeles Galaxy   306/68182   547/2272   57/681  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:49:39.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
