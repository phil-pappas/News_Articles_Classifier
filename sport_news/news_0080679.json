The company hired freelancers to work the cameras during the pope's visit on Sept. 26 and 27.\nThe union applied pressure to NBC10's parent company, Comcast Corp., holding a news conference outside City Hall when Comcast officials were meeting inside with city officials to negotiate the company's cable-TV franchise renewal with the city.\nIBEW also accused the station of breaching security during the pope's visit, when a station executive gave his media credential to one of the freelance camera operators. The operator later obtained his own credential, a union spokesman said in an interview earlier this month.\nThe union did not say whether it had secured the amnesty provision it sought in the contract to protect workers from retaliation for actions taken during the strike. A company source said there was no amnesty provision in the pact.\njvonbergen@phillynews.com\n215-854-2769\n@JaneVonBergen\nwww.philly.com/jobbing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:35:07.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
