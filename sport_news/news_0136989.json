I like to see how it looks or what's going to happen because it's all different. It kinda comes alive when there are different colors and different layers,\" Jamison said. \nJamison traded in her stethoscope for a lot of paint brushes and paintings. \n\"(I've painted) quite a bit in the last 20 years since I retired from nursing. Well over 500 maybe 700, 800. It has been 20 years you know that's a lot of days and a lot of nights,\" Jamison said. \n\"She had an interest for it when she was a little girl however being a mother of 9 children and a full-time RN she wasn't able to pursue her hobby. When she retired, that's when the hobby started. And so her family gifted her an easel for mother day's and her collogues gifted her money to go buy paint,\" granddaughter Nichole Cody said. \nAnd all of these years later this basement is now her make-shift studio. \n\"My entire life, I have watched her paint and going to her basement and seeing her in her little workshop,\" Cody said. \nIt's where Jamison spends the majority of her free time. \n\"I completely escape from all of my trials and tribulations. It's much better to be happy and productive if you can do that,\" Jamison said. \nSurprisingly, Jamison does not have any formal training. \n\"They didn't offer any art courses in high school. The closest I could get was mechanical drawing and it was just for boys so I had to go to the principal and ask if I could please take mechanical drawing so they let me,\" Jamison said. \nThese are skills she has taught herself with the help of her daughter. \n\"My daughter, who does have an art degree, and I would have her critique them and she would say mom it needs more layers,\" Jamison said. \nShirley's artwork is displayed throughout her entire home and she says it's a hobby where she has no plans on stopping anytime soon. \nBrittany Larson: \"Will you ever stop painting?\" Jamison: \"Oh no why would I stop never. As long as I can put these two fingers together.\" \nHer family are some of her biggest fans. \n\"We tell her all the time how fantastic she is and she thinks it's no big deal. She's very humble,\" Cody said. \n\"I don't think I am talented. The children seem to appreciate it. My children encourage me a lot, so that helps a lot,\" Jamison said. \nCody proudly displays several pieces of artwork.\"It's a great thing to look at every time I walk in. In this little room I have five paintings and at home I know I have probably 25 paintings,\" Cody said. \nBut her family are not the only ones who are able to enjoy these paintings. \n\"This particular one is a favorite of all our customers because it has a 3D touch to it,\" Janet Eining, co-owner of the Original Pancake House, said. \nJamison's paintings have hung on the walls of the Sioux Falls restaurant for over a year. \n\"You know, I have told this story over and over, and I can't tell you how many people come over to talk to me about this pictures everyday,\" Eining said. \"They are absolutely gorgeous and they always say, 'Oh I would really like to have her do something for me.' I am grateful to have them here.\" \nAnd it will be something her family will cherish for years to come. \n\"It's a forever memory and I think about that when the time does come that we're always going to have these paintings, it's amazing,\" Cody said. \nWhile Jamison's name is on all of her paintings, one thing you'll never find is a price tag. \n\"If they really admire something I just take it off the wall and give it to them because that's what I do or donate them to a fundraiser for charity or something,\" Jamison said. Because her passion for painting is priceless. \nJamison paintings are also displayed at the Sioux Falls City Council chambers, Cherapa Place, and many people's homes throughout the country.
