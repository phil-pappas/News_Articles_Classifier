The Bobcats lost in four sets a day after defeating the third ranked Spartans. \nThe Trinity Western Spartans were determined to not let Roy Ching destroy them in back-to-back Canada West conference men’s volleyball matches on Saturday. \nThe Spartans did more than that as they served tough and put the Brandon University Bobcat offence in trouble as TWU salvaged a weekend split with a 3-1 (25-20, 24-26, 26-21, 25-21) win at the Healthy Living Centre. The Spartans focused on Ching, who had 22 kills and a .667 attack percentage in Friday’s season opener, and got Brandon out of system often in the rematch. \nChing showed flashes that he’s ready to step up and become a go-to guy for the Bobcats on Saturday — including making four straight kills in the fourth set —but it wasn’t his team’s night. Regardless, the fourth-year left side is ready for responsibility. \n\"We have a really different team compared to last year, so we have to change our game,\" said Ching, who had a team-high 11 kills and was involved in three blocks. \"We need to step up. If that means I have to kill the ball more, then I’m OK with that. It feels good at the moment. I have a lot of belief in the guys around me. If they do their jobs and I do my job, then we should get the best result we can.\" \nBrandon’s passing didn’t set up a lot of strong attacks. BU finished the match with a .083 attack percentage while the Spartans, who are ranked third in Canadian Interuniversity Sport, tallied 14.5 team blocks one night after they had zero. \nMatt Powell added nine kills for Brandon, while Brady Nault and Mason Metcalf both chipped in with four kills and three aces. Ryan Sclater paced Trinity with 18 kills. \nAlthough they ended up splitting their first two matches of the season, Bobcats head coach Grant Wilson saw some positives and thinks the players learned a few lessons. \n\"Overall confidence,\" Wilson said about what he was taking out of the weekend. \"I think some people doubted how competitive we would be with so many new faces, but to be able to play like we did on Friday and win a match against one of the best teams in the country showed that when we do things the right way we’re going to be competitive and we can’t stray from that.\" \nMeanwhile, the bruised and battered women’s volleyball team was beaten pretty soundly on Saturday. \nThe Bobcats were without middle Courtney Roberts, who broke her thumb in Friday’s match, and turned to Jodie Baker, who is recovering from an ankle injury, to start at the middle in her place. When things started poorly for the Bobcats, captain Shanlee McLennan, who hadn’t played in the pre-season or their opener due to an ankle injury, made her season debut and brought some energy. However, it wasn’t enough as they were swept 3-0 (25-21, 25-17, 25-17) by the third-ranked Trinity Western Spartans and dropped to 0-2 on the young campaign. \n\"Obviously this is a tough loss,\" said McLennan, who had eight kills and was happy to get back on the court. \"This isn’t the result we were looking for, but there will be lots of adversity we’ll need to face this year, so we’ll have to figure that one out.\" \nNikala Majewski added six kills for BU. Elizabeth Wendel led TWU, which is ranked third in the country, with 10 kills. Brandonite Alison Quiring saw the court late in the first set and served for the set but didn’t record any statistics. \nBobcats head coach Lee Carter used almost his entire bench in the match, including second-year middle Sara Barker, who impressed Carter. \n\"Sara worked hard this summer,\" he said. \"She’s gotten in way better shape and got two stuff blocks. She scored a ball and served well. It’s nice to see we have Sara in our back pocket. \n\"As a whole, we just need to work harder. We’ve seen the level of ball that we need to play and now we need to surpass that level. Now that we’ve seen it we have to work harder in practice to get to it.\" \nBoth Brandon teams now head on the road to visit the Calgary Dinos next weekend. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:23:36.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
