Wolves beat Middlesbrough 2-0 at Molineux last season, Bakary Sako scoring the opener from the penalty spot. \nBut Karanka's Middlesbrough are themselves going through a sticky patch having picked up one point in their last three, failing to find the target in any of those games. \nAnd the Spaniard has warned his team to 'be careful' about thinking Wolves will be easy opponents. \n\"Maybe Wolves are not in a good moment right now after two bad results but we have to be careful,\" Karanka said. \n\"We can’t go there thinking it will be an easy game for us or we will be in danger of losing. \n\"We have to know it will be a difficult game because every game is difficult in this division.\" \nThe teams exchanged home victories in their league meetings last season, Wolves winning 2-0 at Molineux thanks to goals from Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko, before a 2-1 reverse at the Riverside put a big dent in their play-off hopes in April. \nKaranka added: \"We have to remember Wolves are a good side with good players and we have to remember they beat us 2-0 there last season when we had been unbeaten in seven games. \n\"So it will be a difficult game and we must work very hard to get a good result. \n\"Yes, we beat them 3-0 at the Riverside in the cup last month but I don’t think that will influence this game because it was different players.
