Luxembourg made it interesting with goals by Mario Mutsch in the 61st and Lars Gerson in the 65th, but Hamsik sealed Slovakia's victory in injury time.\nSlovakia last played at the European Championship in 1992 as member of Czechoslovakia.\nUkraine played well and had a series of scoring chances against Spain, but it was stopped by a remarkable performance by Spain goalkeeper David De Gea.\n\"We knew it was going to be tough given Ukraine needed a win,\" De Gea said. \"I always try and do my best. I had a great game and the important thing was to get the win under our belts. I give my all and today had some luck. I need to carry on like that.\"\nGaspar gave Spain the lead in the 22nd minute with a header from near the far post after a cross by Thiago Alcantara. Cesc Fabregas had a chance to increase the lead from the penalty spot two minutes later after being brought down by defender Olexandr Kucher inside the area, but goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov made a great right-handed save.\nThe game was played at a packed Olympic Stadium in Kiev, the same site where Spain won the European title in 2012.\nAmong those in the crowd was Chelsea's Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho.\nIn the other Group C match, Belarus and last-place Macedonia played to a scoreless draw.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:50:30.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
