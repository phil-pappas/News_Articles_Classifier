Designed to operate in shallow, fast-flowing rivers, the small, well-armed gunboats featured a 4-foot draft, tunneled twin propellers and three large rudders for maneuverability.\n“They were first used during World War I and continued in use through the Vietnam War,” said Wendy Melton, curator at Ships of the Sea.\nAlthough they were originally intended for use on the Danube, the first four ships — aptly named Gnat, Mantis, Moth and Tarantula — made their World War I debuts on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers during the Mesopotamian Campaign.\nThe ship’s model was presented Wednesday at the trade center’s monthly board meeting.\nCanal on course?\nAccording to the Journal of Commerce, Panama Canal Administrator Jorge Quijano has assured shipping leaders that the canal’s new, larger locks will open on schedule next year, despite the most recent issue of multiple leaks in one of the recently constructed concrete sills.\nAs reported in this column last month, photos of some pretty serious leaks at the head of one of the new locks on the Pacific side began surfacing on social media in August, prompting the Panama Canal Authority to issue a warning that it would not accept the current work until all flaws were addressed and repaired to the authority’s satisfaction.\nOn Oct. 1, the Journal of Commerce reported those repairs would be more extensive than previously indicated, making the date for their completion even more uncertain.\nThe central concern for the shipping industry has been the extent to which the leak repairs could again delay the commercial opening of the expanded canal, which is scheduled for April.\nThe $5.25 billion expansion project was originally slated for completion in October 2014 to coincide with the canal’s 100th anniversary, but a labor strike and disagreements over cost overruns between the canal authority and the consortium of contractors working on the project have pushed that deadline back.\nQuijano talked about the canal expansion’s progress Wednesday in Copenhagen at the Danish Maritime Forum.\n“It hasn’t been easy,” he said, referring to the leaks and to other disputes with the consortium, but added that the work is 95 percent complete.\nThe new locks will allow passage of container ships with capacities up to about 14,000 20-foot-equivalent units — nearly triple the size of ships that currently can fit through the existing 100-foot-wide locks.\nHowever, Quijano said the expanded canal won’t immediately handle 14,000-TEU vessels. Rather, the size of ships coming through the locks will increase gradually as pilots become accustomed to the new conditions.\nPorts also have to be ready to handle the super ships.\nIn the nearly 10 years since Panama’s voters approved the project, ports up and down the East Coast have been scrambling to get the deeper water those ships will require.\nCurrently, the deepest channels — at 50 feet — are in Virginia, Baltimore and Miami. New York/New Jersey is almost done with its deepening to 50 feet but now has to deal with the issue of the Bayonne Bridge, whose vertical clearance limits all but one of the port’s main terminals.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said recently that a $1.3 billion project to raise the bridge’s clearance has been pushed to the end of 2017.\nSavannah is expected to finish deepening its harbor to 47 feet in 2018 and Charleston is aiming for a 2019 completion of its deepening efforts, according to the JOC.\nSenior business reporter Mary Carr Mayle covers the ports for the Savannah Morning News and savannahnow.
