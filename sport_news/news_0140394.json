(AP) - Forrest County is finally getting reimbursed for replacing 233 voting machines that were damaged in the February 2013 tornado that ripped through the area.\nDuring Monday's Forrest County Board of Supervisors meeting, The Hattiesburg American reports ( http://hatne.ws/1L40Kco ) board members acknowledged a copy of a check in the amount of $245,000 in full and final settlement of property claims made in connection with the tornado.\nThe board voted in November 2013 to replace the machines - which were exposed to rain after the storm damaged the roof of the county election building on East Fifth Street - at a cost of about $250,000.\nThe county will explore options to put the old machines up for sale.\nInformation from: The Hattiesburg American, http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
