Everything we've asked them to do, they've done.\" (Bradley Leeb / AP) Shannon Ryan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Will interim coach Bill Cubit remain at Illinois? \nWhen Illinois promoted Bill Cubit to interim head coach a week before the season, the team's offensive coordinator said he would treat the job as if it was a permanent position. \n\"You're going to see a passionate, hard-working (coach) out there, and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it,\" Cubit said on Aug. 31. \"I'm representing the great University of Illinois and the administration, and I want to present a good image.\" \nCubit wears suits to news conferences. He sells tickets on the campus quad. He takes pictures with fans in restaurants. He has become known in Champaign as more than a fill-in. \nWhile his future at Illinois beyond this season is murky, it's obvious the team has shown significant improvement. \nThe Illini's 3-3 record at this point last year wasn't much different than their current 4-2 mark (1-1 Big Ten). But observers point to a higher level of play and more convincing victories. \nLast season, the Illini squeaked by weak nonconference opponents. They were trounced at Washington. They started Big Ten play with three straight losses. \nIllinois entered this past week's open date with reason to believe after beating Nebraska 14-13 and putting up a fight in a 29-20 loss at undefeated Iowa. Besides a 48-14 blowout loss at North Carolina, the Illini have been far more competitive and are tied for second in the West Division behind Iowa. \n\"We're a little bit further ahead (of where I thought we would be),\" Cubit said. \"You really never know going into it. I love the way that our kids are playing hard. I love the commitment and the focus that they're using. Everything we've asked them to do, they've done.\" \nSome say this is a carryover from last season, when Illinois won its final two regular-season games and earned a bowl berth. \n\"I thought the team would have played better anyway,\" former Illini fullback and current Big Ten Network analyst Howard Griffith said. \"I know Cubit has had a huge part of it. He held them together and rallied them and got them going. But it was a better team as long as they were staying healthy.\" \nGiven the turmoil Illinois faced in the offseason, though, the strong start seems more impressive to many. \nAfter former players aired complaints about the way the program operated under coach Tim Beckman, many current players were interviewed by a university-hired law firm as part of an investigation into the complaints. \nAnd after the firm's preliminary report confirmed instances of player mistreatment, Illinois fired Beckman a week before the season opener against Kent State. \n\"You have to give (Cubit) a lot of credit for a putting a lot of thought into what he would do if put into this situation,\" Griffith said. \"Not that he was hoping this would happen, but he was really prepared. It worked out well and it's a tough situation.\" \nThe future holds uncertainty for Cubit and the Illini. \nA final report by the Chicago law firm Franczek Radelet on the player-mistreatment allegations is pending, and some have speculated that could lead to the dismissal of athletic director Mike Thomas. A new AD would almost certainly hire a new football coach, and even if Thomas is retained, he might elect for a fresh start. \nFor now, Cubit is concentrating on preparing for the Illini's homecoming game Saturday against Wisconsin. \n\"We've just got to keep on going,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:08:31.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
