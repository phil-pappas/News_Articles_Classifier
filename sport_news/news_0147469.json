ASU beats U of A on the ice (Photo: 12 Sports) CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nArizona State hockey's upcoming season will be a first for the program, but Saturday night was more of the same for the Sun Devils. \nASU played their first game as a NCAA D1 program at Gila River Arena in front of a good-size crowd. In-state rival Arizona was the opponent, and just like that we had NCAA hockey in Arizona. \nThe Sun Devils would roll to a 8-1 victory over the Wildcats, but it wasn't the score line that mattered on Saturday. \nHistory was made. \nThe atmosphere in the arena was that of a NCAA program, and the Sun Devils lived up to it on the ice. \n\"There was already a ton of crowd when we went out for warm ups and we thought it was going to be sweet. Then when we went out for the National Anthemâ€¦ you get chills down your spine,\" said defenseman Connor Schmidt. \nSaturday was bittersweet for ASU though, as it marked one of the last times the Sun Devils would face off against U of A. \nWith ASU elevating to NCAA, there is only one scheduled meeting left later this year between the two schools.
