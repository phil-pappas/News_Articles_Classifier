Hamlin and Kenseth have advanced into the second round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship with wins in the first two races. \nThe 16-driver field is sliced to 12 following Sunday's race at Dover International Speedway. Reigning series champion Kevin Harvick is 15th in the standings and will likely have to win to advance and remain in championship contention. \nKyle Busch, Paul Menard, Harvick and Clint Bowyer are in the bottom four and most at risk of elimination on Sunday.
