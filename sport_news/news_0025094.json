There was nothing positive to take from this debacle, just a complete mess in every phase. Rex Ryan's honeymoon is over. Pass Offense I thought Greg Roman's game plan was flawed from the start. Where was the creativity? For three quarters it was nothing but blah. Tyrod Taylor ended up with decent numbers, but they were supremely flawed. He made some poor decisions, and penalties cost the Bills two TDs. Charles Clay was pretty good, Percy Harvin was invisible.
