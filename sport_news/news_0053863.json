Place could breathe. \nThe Caps (16-13-5) at least felt assured of a home playoff game at that point. What most in the stands probably didn't realize was just how big the goal was. \nWith the combination of scores before Manneh's strike, the Caps were sitting fifth. Suddenly, they were in second. And just a few seconds after that goal, Dom Dwyer put K.C. ahead 2-1 in L.A. and solidified the Caps' place in the semis. \nIt ended comfortably for Carl Robinson's squad but felt anything but for an hour. \nWhen the dust settled across the West, Robinson was asked if he was surprised with second place, considering they'd been winless in five games coming into Sunday. \n\"No,\" he said. \"Over 34 games, the league doesn't lie. It evens itself out. We deserve to be where we are.\" \nAnd where they are is into their first ever MLS conference semifinal. They've never hosted a home playoff game. That will happen Nov. 8, the second leg of a series that opens next Sunday somewhere. \nFirst-place Dallas has the other bye, while No. 3 Portland hosts No. 6 Kansas City, and No. 4 Seattle hosts No. 5 L.A. \nDallas will match up against the lowest remaining seed after the mid-week knockout games. The Caps will get the other. \n\"I think it's very important for us,\" Robinson said of securing second place, the bye, and buying some more time for his guys coming back off injury. \n\"We've never used injuries as an excuse, and I never will,\" he said. \nBut he'll be thrilled to get Nicolas Mezquida (hamstring) another week of training. He made the bench Sunday but wasn't used. \nSame goes for Mauro Rosales (groin), who set up Robert Earnshaw's pretty 3-0 goal as a late substitute. \nAnd might Pedro Morales (hamstring) even make it back in time for the playoffs now? \nRobinson has said his captain is \"50/50\" for a return this season. He backed off that a bit Sunday, saying only that he didn't know, and he was hopeful, and that Morales was desperate to get back. \nWinger Cristian Techera also started after missing the Dallas game with a hamstring strain and he reminded everyone of how important he is to the Caps' attack. \nAfter a grim month, full of injuries, missed chances and dropped points, there's plenty of reason for hope again. \nThe Caps don't have a top-class striker. Scoring will have to be by committee if they're going anywhere in the playoffs, but there were encouraging signs against Houston. \nManneh helped his confidence and Kendall Waston scored on a set piece. The Caps have the most road wins in MLS, the best defensive record in MLS, and that all bodes well for a two-legged series. \n\"We're not there to make up the numbers,\" Robinson said of the playoffs. \"We're there to try and win it.\" \nmweber@theprovince.com \ntwitter.com/ProvinceWeber \nVancouver 3 Houston 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:38:19.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
