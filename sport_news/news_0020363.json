Just four of those were pitchers, and the only starter was Yordano Ventura, who helped Kansas City to victory in the decisive Game 6. \nThe Royals used the same roster in the divisional round against Houston, and figure to have a similar makeup when they open the World Series on Tuesday night against the Mets. \n\"This is a different team,\" Royals manager Ned Yost acknowledged, \"but we play the same.\" \nBy that, he means the Royals still rely on pitching and defense. They still win by making fewer mistakes than the opponent. They still cause havoc on the base paths, rarely strike out. \nIt’s just that the cast of characters doing it is slightly different. \nThe Royals walked on an expensive option on designated hitter Billy Butler, signing Kendrys Morales to replace him. The move proved to be brilliant: Morales hit 22 homers during the regular season and has hit four more during the playoffs. \n\"He’s been the middle-of-the-order bat from the first day,\" Yost said. \"He put up tremendous numbers, power numbers, RBI numbers, he’s been great from both sides of the plate.\" \nIn the field, the Royals moved on from right fielder Nori Aoki by signing Alex Rios, who is hitting .333 in the first playoff appearance of his 12-year career. Second baseman Omar Infante has been hurt, so deadline-acquisition Ben Zobrist has taken over, hitting .326 while driving in six runs this postseason — including two homers against Toronto. \nThe utility men have been Paulo Orlando and Christian Colon, rather than Josh Willingham and Jayson Nix. All of them easily could be considered upgrades. \nBut it’s among the pitchers where the differences are most stark: Along with Ventura, the rotation consists of Edinson Volquez, Johnny Cueto and Chris Young, while last year it was James Shields, Jeremy Guthrie and Jason Vargas in the postseason. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:51:02.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
