(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) \nNEW YORK – Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Chase Utley was eligible to play Monday night but was not in the starting lineup for Game 3 of the National League Division Series against the New York Mets. \nUtley appealed the two-game suspension he received from Major League Baseball on Sunday night for his slide that broke the leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada on Saturday night in Los Angeles, and he is eligible to play until he is afforded a hearing and a ruling is issued. The appeal could not be heard in time for Game 3 and likely won’t be heard before Tuesday’s Game 4, according to people familiar with the situation. The players’ association will make a presentation on Utley’s behalf. [ Thomas Boswell: Utley’s slide offers MLB a chance to correct a situation that is long overdue ] \nUtley, 36, came to the Dodgers from the Phillies in a midseason trade, and he has a great deal of experience facing both the Mets as a whole and Monday’s starting pitcher, right-hander Matt Harvey. Utley entered Monday 6 for 18 with a double and a home run against Harvey, leading the Mets to believe he would start Game 3. \n“I’m a little surprised,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said. “Don [Mattingly, the Dodgers’ manager] knows his team better than me, but I got the same stats he’s got, and I know he swings the bat pretty good against Matt Harvey. … He has a knack of beating us somehow. So let him sit over on the bench for eight innings.” \nMattingly went with right-handed-hitting Howie Kendrick, his normal starter, at second base. \n“Howie’s been swinging the bat good,” Mattingly said, “and feel like he gives us the best chance to win today.” \nMattingly said his conversations with Utley largely centered around whether he felt comfortable having his family at Citi Field, where the environment was expected to be hostile, to say the least. \n“Chase has played a long time, played in big games,” Mattingly said. “So I don’t think the moment – you don’t worry about him being ready for that. You worry about: Does all that other stuff get in there and make sure he’s comfortable with MLB security, MLB taking care of all the issues.” \nCommissioner Rob Manfred told reporters he planned to meet with both managers before the game to stress the importance of clean play on the field.
