Patterson had a couple of opportunities earlier, but had one shot deflected by the goalie and another went wide left. \n“Rowan got the ball in the back,” Patterson said. “I guess he kind of saw my run coming across. He split the two center backs, and I was through — wide-open, no one on me or anything. The goalkeeper was in front of me, but I just curled (the shot) around him.” \n“It was a pretty spectacular fashion to win, but we should’ve had a few goals by then,” Patterson added. \nThe Vikings (3-8) scored in the 23rd minute when senior forward Magdiel Meza ripped a shot from inside the 18-yard box past FSHS goalkeeper Jonathan Lesslie, who finished with three saves. \nBut the Firebirds (6-3) controlled the pace and tempo throughout the match with their crisp offense. Laufer and senior forward Eduardo Carballido Flores both sent strong opportunities on net. \n“When you’ve had so many chances in front of the goal, you’ve got to find a way to win that game,” FSHS coach Kelly Barah said. “We were really clicking on all cylinders in terms of the attacking side of the ball. It was just that little foot to tap it into the goal that was kind of letting us down. We just knew it was going to take every single thing for us to find that win today.” \nThe Firebirds will play host to Shawnee Heights at 6:30 p.m. Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:31:13.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
