It is mischievous and I don’t know what he intends to achieve by this.” \n“I have never connived with anyone nor intend to do so. I have an excellent rapport with Kwesi Nyantakyi and I believe in the vision of the FA,” he added. \n“I believe my reputation was by dint of hard work and would not allow anyone to drag my name in the mud.” \nThe former Chief Executive Officer of Accra Hearts of Oak challenged Salam Yakubu to name and shame those he claims are plotting against the FA Boss or consider himself a detractor and a liar. \nFor more Ghana football news visit www.ghanasoccernet.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:38:09.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
