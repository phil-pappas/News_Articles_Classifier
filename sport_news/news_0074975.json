(Will Vragovic/Tampa Bay Times/MCT) ORG XMIT: 1145402 (Will Vragovic / MCT) Edgar Thompson Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel The Commodores last visit to the Swamp ended in a stunning 34-17 win by Vanderbilt \nThe Florida Gators Nov. 7 homecoming game against Vanderbilt will be televised at noon on either the SEC Network or ESPN2. \nThe Commodores (3-4, 1-3 SEC) just earned their first conference win in 12 tries under coach Derek Mason, edging Missouri 10-3 Saturday night in Nashville. \nThe SEC East-leading Gators (6-1, 4-1) are coming off a bye week and will face rival Georgia on Saturday in Jacksonville. Vanderbilt will visit unbeaten Houston before the Commodores turn their attention to Florida. \nVanderbilt's last visit to the Swamp ended in a stunning 34-17 win for the Commdores during Florida's homecoming. The loss, one of the most shocking of the Will Muschamp era, was the Gators first to Vanderbilt since 1988 - and first in Gainesville since 1945. \nMuch has changed since then for both programs. \nCoach James Franklin left Vanderbilt for Penn State after the 2013 season, paving the way for Mason's hire. The Commodores enjoyed unprecedented success under Franklin, including successive nine-win season. \nUnder Mason, Vanderbilt is 6-13, including 1-11 in SEC play. \nMuschamp was fired after the 2014 season and replaced by Jim McElwain, who returned the Gators to the national rankings and the top of the East division standings. \nEmail Edgar Thompson at egthompson@orlandosentinel.com .
