Photo: Getty Images\nSeahawks head coach Pete Carroll has given a rave review of the former Australian rugby league star and confirmed his team had big plans for Hayne.\nAdvertisement \"We thought he could really be a highlighted player,\" Carroll told reporters.\nWhen Hayne announced a year ago he was quitting the NRL and was moving to the US in an attempt to win a roster spot on an NFL team, the Seahawks, Detroit Lions and 49ers were the top three options.\nCarroll, just like the 49ers' head coach Jim Tomsula, is considered unconventional and willing to experiment.\nThe 49ers are using Hayne as a punt returner and back-up running back, but Carroll said the Seahawks could have used him in other positions.\n\"We had a lot of thoughts about how we were going to use him,\" Carroll said.\nHayne and the 49ers will host the Seahawks on Thursday (Friday AEDT) in a game that will define the bitter NFC West division rivals' seasons.\nThe teams have both underperformed with two wins, four loss records.\nThis week's winner will keep alive their playoff hopes while the loser faces impossible odds.\nHayne said he chose the 49ers because of Tomsula's history in NFL Europe where he transformed athletes into American footballers.\nThe 49ers also guaranteed Hayne $US100,000 ($138,660) - something the Seahawks didn't.\n\"I thought it was an exciting prospect to get him in here,\" Carroll said.\n\"We tried to.\n\"We talked to him about visiting and all that and so it's really cool to see that he's playing and contributing and is a factor in the game.\n\"He's done some really good stuff.\"\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:30:58.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
