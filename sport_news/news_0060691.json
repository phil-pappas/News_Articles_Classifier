Broncos legend Terrell Davis is now a motivational speaker with Corporate Kickoff, and he will deliver highly relevant and impactful messages about leadership development and team-building.\n\"I've been part of great teams my entire life,\" Davis said. \"When I learned what Corporate Kickoff was doing, and saw the team that they had put together, I knew that I had found my next great team.\"\nDavis said that NFL teams have perfected the art of pulling a group of people together, convincing them to set aside their personal agendas, and commit themselves fully to the team goal.\n\"The best news,\" Davis said, \"is that the strategies NFL teams use to accomplish this work equally well in the corporate world.\"\nDavis will deliver a presentation called \"The Business of Football: Strategies from the gridiron that will grow your business.\" In it, he helps corporate teams understand that \"trust\" is the fundamental ingredient that supervisors, peers, subordinates and everyone else in the company must build if they want to win the loyalty of their customers.\nDavis will demonstrate through powerful examples straight from the NFL, how leadership--not authority--is the key to outstanding team performance.\n\"This is such an exciting day for us,\" said Reggie Rivers , President of Corporate Kickoff. \"Terrell and I played together during the 1990s, and I have always admired his talent, work ethic, team-first attitude and achievements. He's a smart, successful, articulate leader, and I'm delighted that he is bringing that talent to Corporate Kickoff.\"\nRivers played six seasons with the Denver Broncos from 1991-1996, and he and Davis were teammates during the 1995 and 1996 seasons.\n\"I was a 5th-year veteran when TD came into the league,\" Rivers said, \"so I had the opportunity to watch him come into the league as a 6th-round draft pick, and quickly become a household name. Aside from his obvious talent, I also saw his work ethic, composure under pressure, humility and leadership. The more the pressure grew, the better he performed. I learned a lot from TD.\"\nDavis currently works for the NFL Network as a studio analyst. His NFL resume includes many once-in-a-lifetime achievements.\nTwo Super Bowl victories League MVP Super Bowl MVP Member of the 2,000-yard rushing club 3-time Pro Bowler 3-time first-team All Pro 2-time NFL Offensive Player of the Year NFL 1990s All-Decade team Inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame Induction into the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame Finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame \"Plenty of athletes can get up and tell their stories of how they became great,\" Rivers said. \"What makes Terrell different is that his stories reveal strategies that have been tested and proven in the NFL, and those strategies translate instantly from the football field to the corporate office.\"\nTo learn more about Terrell and his keynote presentations, please visit: http://corporatekickoff.com/company/services/speaking/business-of-football-td/\nMedia Contact:\nDani Espinosa\n1-720-507-4320\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/277063\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/former-denver-broncos-running-back-terrell-davis-joins-corporate-kickoff-as-motivational-speaker-300160282.html\nÂ©2015 ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151014/277063", "http://corporatekickoff.com/company/services/speaking/business-of-football-td/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/277063", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/former-denver-broncos-running-back-terrell-davis-joins-corporate-kickoff-as-motivational-speaker-300160282.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH28817&Transmission_Id=201510150830PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH28817&DateId=20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:10:01.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
