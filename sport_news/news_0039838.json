Tyler Chauvin is the award winning mixologist / general manager.\n\"Treo..it's Gallic for direction,\" she said.\nThat new direction is taking shape all around. University Medical Center is now open. The new plan for Tulane Ave., calls for landscaping, bike lanes, and yes, even legal left turns.\n\"When I was young you had to go to the river to make a left turn,\" said Fortier.\nSome Tulane Ave. businesses are complaining about the construction and the elimination of their parking spaces, others say it's actually been good for business.\n\"In the last month or so we've increased business. Cars slowing down see us, they aren't just passing us by,\" said Fortier.\nOn the heels of Finn McCool's success, Treo's is capitalizing on a belief in Mid City...offering award winning cocktails, and a menu featuring items like lamb meat balls and mussels.\n\"We've had good business every night, it hasn't lacked at all,\" said Tyler.\nTreo's believes the roadwork, and improvements to come, will pay off.\n\"It's a bit frustrating, because of parking....but in the end, it gives you the visual,\" said Tyler.\nWe asked Fortier,\"Did you ever think you'd see the turnaround of Tulane ave in your life?\" \"No never,\" he said.\nThe transformation has begun, and many are optimistic, about a new future, for one of the city's aging thoroughfares.\nBambi Hall with the state transportation office says the work is just beginning, and will be done in three phases. The current phase covers Tulane Ave., between Carrollton, and S. Broad. It's expected to take up to two more years.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
