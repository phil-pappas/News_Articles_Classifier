For many years, Technogym has been active promoting wellness as a social opportunity for communities, governments and enterprises. \"Let's Move and donate food\" is an initiative aimed at leveraging technology to help address world hunger, targeting a tech-savvy generation. Technogym provides the first platform to connect equipment to a cloud ecosystem for physical exercise management.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277653\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277652LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/technogym-to-donate-650000-meals-to-malnourished-children-300161208.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
