Guess what? There is a chance that Odell Beckham Jr. , Rueben Randle and Victor Cruz won't play in Monday night's showdown at Philadelphia, with first place on the line in the NFC East.

Beckham and Randle injured their hamstrings Sunday night, and head coach Tom Coughlin said there are no guarantees they will be ready. If that's the case, Eli Manning 's top receivers are: Dwayne Harris , Geremy Davis and Myles White Sorry, but you can't win with that trio.
