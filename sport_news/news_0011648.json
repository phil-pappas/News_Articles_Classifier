Alabama now gets a week off before hosting No. 5 LSU in what sets up — again — as a pivotal SEC West showdown.\nThe Tide has won five straight overall since losing to Mississippi, looking every bit the playoff contender. Alabama won at Georgia, against Arkansas and at Texas A&M by a combined 106-47. Nick Saban's team had to work much harder to extend its winning streak against the Vols to nine, but be careful about trying to ding the Tide for a close victory at the end of a tough stretch.\nThe Tide has some offensive limitations, but the defensive front is as good as any in the country and running back Derrick Henry alone gives them a reliable weapon.\nAlabama (7-1) still needs help just to get to the Southeastern Conference title game in the form of an Ole Miss loss. The 24th-ranked Rebels hosted No. 15 Texas A&M on Saturday night.\nClemson (7-0) won't need any help getting to the playoff if it keeps playing the way it did against Miami.\nIt was the most-lopsided loss in Hurricanes' history and surely did nothing to help the job security of Miami coach Al Golden.\nClemson is at North Carolina State next week before what could be the game of the year in the Atlantic Coast Conference. No. 9 Florida State visits Death Valley on Nov. 7.\nDeshaun Watson and the Tigers have already beaten Notre Dame, but the rest of their schedule beyond the Seminoles provides little chance to catch the playoff selection committee's attention — unless they are blowing out teams. Clemson has won its last three games by a combined 135-41.\nThat'll work.\nUnbeaten will likely be enough to get any Power Five conference team into the playoff, though one-loss teams such as Alabama and Stanford (5-1) out of the Pac-12 might disagree.\nThe first playoff rankings come out Nov. 3, a few days before those potential showdown games between LSU and Alabama, and Clemson and Florida State. The committee showed last year with Florida State that it is willing to place an unbeaten team behind one with a loss if that undefeated team has been less-than-overwhelming.\nSo far Clemson is doing its best to avoid a similar fate.\n___\nREBOUNDING SOONERS\nIt was tempting to count out No. 17 Oklahoma after the Sooners stumbled against Texas in the Red River Rivalry two weeks ago.\nAfter a second straight blowout, the Sooners are creeping back into the playoff conversation.\nOklahoma beat Texas Tech 63-27 on Saturday, a strong follow-up to its 55-0 victory at Kansas State last week.\nBaker Mayfield and the Sooners play Kansas and Iowa State next before finishing the season at No. 2 Baylor, against No. 4 TCU and at No. 14 Oklahoma State.\nWhen considering the best one-loss teams, the Sooners needed to be in the mix.\n___\nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
