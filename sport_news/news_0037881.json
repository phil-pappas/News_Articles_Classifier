But without fans football is not worth a penny.” \nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger’s side won the game 2-0. \n“I will speak with Wenger for next time to make it cheaper for our fans,” said Bayern boss Pep Guardiola. \n“We will take care of Arsenal fans in Munich with a good price. They can travel.” \nA BBC Price of Football study, which analysed costs at 227 clubs across Britain and Europe, found that Arsenal have the most expensive match-day ticket in the Premier League at £97. \nIn contrast, Bayern Munich’s cheapest season ticket (all matches) in the Bundesliga is £140. \nEarlier this month, the Football Supporters’ Federation coordinated protests at all 20 Premier League clubs and 10 Championship teams, to call for a £20 cap on away ticket prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:41:07.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
