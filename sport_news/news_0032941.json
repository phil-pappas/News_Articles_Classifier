Hopefully, we can have this lineup for regionals.\" Macomb was led by senior Jennsen Protsman with 7 kills, Haylee Coker had 6 kills and 4 blocks, and Kalela Stone added 7 blocks at the net for the Bombers. Macomb improved to 6-1 in the West Central Conference and 16-15 overall, while the Titans slipped to 13-16 on the season and 3-4 in league play. Macomb's Stone, a strong southpaw hitter in the front row, took some time to comment on the match. \"I think we came through pretty well,\" Stone said. \"They (M-R) are a tough team. They played good.\" About being a front-row hitter with a wicked left hand, Stone said, \"It throws off the blockers and confuses the back row.\" In the first set, Macomb jumped out to dominant leads of 12-4 and 21-12. The second and third sets had several ties and lead changes. Titans coach Lynn Halcomb said her team played some of its best volleyball of the season in their second and third sets. Titan sophomore Kaylee Woodard played another well-rounded match with team-highs of 8 digs, 3 blocks and 9 service points. Junior Hannah McVey added 5 kills, Emma Plate passed for 13 assists and Grace Ferguson had 4 kills. \"Like I just told my mom, we would have liked to have been on the winning side of it,\" Halcomb said. \"That is the best we've played against Macomb all year. The second and third sets were definitely our level of play.\" Not to be overlooked was a packed gym to fight cancer on pink out night in honor of Coach Robin Bell and the late Tracey Williams.
