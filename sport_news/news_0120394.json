Indicating a recession in the real estate sector and overpricing of the residential plots, the large-scale surrender of plots, that too in a housing scheme floated by the government-run undertaking, has raised concerns. Sources in GMADA said more than 50 per cent of the total 325 allottees in different categories of plots had surrendered their plots within one year of the allotment. GMADA Chief Administrator AK Sinha claimed that those surrendering their plots had made speculative investment. “Since the plots did not give returns, they are now surrendering their plots,” said Sinha. The plots in question are reportedly available at much cheaper rates than the price set by GMADA. The sources said of the total 325 residential plots, GMADA had received nearly 175 letters of surrender of property. The plots are of various sizes — 200 sq yards (75 plots), 300 sq yards (100 plots), 400 sq yards (50 plots) and 500 sq yards (100 plots). Except the 200 sq yard category, the other three categories are the worst hit with nearly 60 per cent of the plots having been surrendered so far. Around 40 per cent plots have been surrendered in the 200 sq yard category. Against the GMADA price of Rs 23,500 per sq yard, the plots of 400 sq yard and 500 sq yd sizes are available for around Rs 16,000 per sq yard in the open market, say property dealers in the area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:03:35.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
