Baldivieso anticipated making various changes to the line-up that was used in the match against Uruguay on October 8 where they lost 0-2 in La Paz, Xinhua reported. “We are going to give it our all on the pitch. We know our limits but also, we have talents that we should make the most of to get a positive result this time,” said the coach. The team’s plan is to wait in the middle of the field so that when Ecuador make a mistake, Bolivia will be ready to take the opportunity and launch a counter-attack, the coach said in a news conference. Baldivieso is aware of Ecuador’s potential, especially after they surprisingly defeated Argentina 2-0 away in their first match of the qualifiers. Sebastian Gamarra, 18-year-old midfielder for Italian club AC Milan, appeared at recent training sessions, according to local media. The young player, who has only played for his country once in a friendly against Argentina prior to the Copa America, has been seen in the midfield line-up in training along with Alejandro Chumacero, Walter Veizaga and Raul Castro. Another addition to the team is local side Sport Boys Warnes’ goalkeeper, Carlos Lampe. The 1.92 metre tall player has probably been included in the line-up due to Ecuador’s team being taller than the Bolivian one. His presence should benefit the counter-attack. On the right side, the coach appeared to be keeping defender Juan Carlos Zampiery in the same position as well as Fernando Marteli in central defence. There was also a change to the offence in the training session with Gilbert Alvarez instead of Yasmani Duk while Juan Carlos Arce seems to be keeping the same position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:30:22.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
