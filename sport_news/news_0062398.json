John Collins/Baker City Herald Forest Service officials are asking the public for ideas about salvaging trees burned in this summer’s unprecedented wildfires in Baker County, as well as removing roadside trees that pose a danger. The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest is looking at options following the Cornet/Windy Ridge, Eldorado, Eagle Complex and Dry Gulch fires. Combined those blazes burned more than 150,000 acres in Baker County, including about 48,725 acres on the Wallowa-Whitman. According to a Wallowa-Whitman press release, forest officials are “considering a variety of management opportunities across each of these fire areas including looking at salvage of fire killed trees and removal of hazard trees on or near the impacted Forest Road systems for safety of the public and employees.” Wallowa-Whitman officials expect that any salvage projects that result will be exempt from a lengthy environmental assessment or impact statement, under a provision in federal law known as “categorical exclusion.” That means the work, if any, could start as soon as this fall, according to the press release. Salvage logging under the categorical exclusion is limited, however, to 250 acres per project. The deadline to submit ideas or comments is Oct. 16. Submit comments to: Jeff Tomac, Whitman District Ranger, 1550 Dewey Ave., Suite A, Baker City, OR 97814. Submissions should include the phrase “Whitman Fires Danger Tree Removal and Salvage” with written comments. Comments may be hand delivered to the above address between 7:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on weekdays (except legal holidays).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:05:22.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
