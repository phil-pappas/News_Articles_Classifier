Haddock had 6 kills and 13 total attacks this game. (Maddi Driggs) \nStarters for BYU were Alexa Gray, Amy Boswell, Camry Willardson, Cosy Burnett, Whitney Young Howard, Lacy Haddock and Ciara Parker. \nThe Cougars quickly won the three sets scoring 25-16, 25-17 and 25-15 respectively. \nGray led the team with 21 kills and Willardson led with 27 set assists and 11 digs. Boswell lead the team with three block assists. \nAnother highlight was seeing the freshmen play. Haddock and Veronica Jones have played several games this season, but girls proved to be vital assets in today’s game. Haddock ended the game with six kills, 13 total attacks and two digs. Jones had four kills and 10 total attacks. Sophie Cram and Lyndie Haddock also made it to the court in the third set. \n“It was a really good team effort by us,” Jones said. “It was fun to see all the different girls working together and doing a good job at what they were doing.” \nThe game against Portland also happened to be the Alumni Game for BYU. Several former volleyball staff and athletes were in attendance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:52:45.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
