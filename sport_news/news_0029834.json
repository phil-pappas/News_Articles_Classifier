That's what it's all about.\" \nRepresentatives from Atlas and Chivas, as C.D. Guadalajara is affectionately called, came to San Jose to promote the Nov. 14 game that promoters expect to sell out. Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday through Ticketmaster or Avaya Stadium. Prices start at $35. \nThe game follows a Mexican League showdown between the teams Oct. 24 in Guadalajara. Chivas currently is in 10th place, Atlas 14th in Liga MX. \nBut like with the Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers, records don't matter when they meet. \n\"It is more than the three points, it is the civic pride,\" said Juan Mariano Varela, Chivas' sports manager. \nChivas leads the series 79-64-63 after the teams played to a scoreless draw in July in a preseason exhibition in front of 16,821 fans in Fresno. But Atlas' Fraga had a prediction about the upcoming games. \n\"We are going to win two this year,\" he said. Advertisement \nGuadalajara midfielder Jorge Enriquez wasn't going to make a prediction Wednesday. But he likes taking the derby to California where the team has thousands of followers. Enriquez said that it's important to give fans north of the border a chance to experience the rivalry's atmosphere in Mexico's second-largest city. \n\"We want to bring some of that contagious fever here,\" he said.
