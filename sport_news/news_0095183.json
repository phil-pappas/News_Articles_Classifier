But he does know mathematics, statistical models and software. He said that knowledge led him to picking the correct winner and score of the Super Bowl last year and correctly picking six of seven playoff games against the spread. Nag is the CEO and founder of Nag, Inc., which he calls a “boutique software” company. The company is based in Claremont and has developed software for the International Space Station and worked with various state governments, the federal government and NASA among others to provide data visualization. Nag grew up in what was Burma (now Myanmar) and is more of a soccer fan. He moved to the United States about 30 years ago. Nag started predicting games after a challenge from Lou Desmond, who does public relations for Nag’s company, a little more than a year ago. Desmond said he thought it might be interesting to use some of the same principles and technology to predict games. Nag offers those picks each week at Specumetrix.com . “He sort of said, ‘If you are so smart, you should be able to tell me who is going to be able to win the Super Bowl.’” Nag said. “I told him, I’m sure I can.” “It gives me an opportunity to use some of my technology to do something which is fun,” Nag said. Desmond spent an afternoon last year explaining the very basics of football without giving too much away. “He could care less about football,” Desmond said. “He will tell you he doesn't know anything about it. That would skew how he sees the numbers.” Then Nag began building a statistical model. With limited data to pull from, the experiment started off rough, they picked correctly against the spread in just 37 percent of games in the first week last year. Nag said his model picked at about 65 percent clip by the end the regular season and has kept it up this year. He said he only spends about half an hour on it a week. The automated software does most of the work pulling statistics and calculating outcomes while he tweaks the model. Desmond hosts a Sunday radio show on both KMET 1490 out of Redlands and 1350 Fox Sports Radio out of Riverside and gives out the picks each week. They also write about the picks and what the data is telling them at Specumetrix.com . So why not take a trip to Vegas, use the picks to make millions and then retire to a private island? “Believe me, I thought about it,” Desmond said. “This is about bringing attention to what his company does. This is just a fun way to get it out there. “If he was doing something about tracking shipping containers worldwide, would you be interested? That sort of thing, that’s what he gets paid to do but it’s not very interesting to your average reader.” Nag said the betting aspect doesn’t interest him, but he’s considered charging $10 for his picks if enough people eventually become interested. Fewer than 200 currently visit the site each week. Nag said it would take around 5,000 before he charges. And if that never happens, Nag said he’s having fun running some numbers. “This is just something we do for fun,” Nag said. “I’m not trying to make money from my predictions. It’s more, hey, there is a rationale behind this. We are trying to debunk a lot of the myth.” By Matthew Peters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:03:35.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
