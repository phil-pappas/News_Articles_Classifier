And reliably, maddeningly incapable of living up to expectations whenever they rise. \nThe latest incontrovertible proof came Sunday at Ralph Wilson Stadium: New York Giants 24, Bills 10. \nThis is no piling-on rip-job after another luckless loss by the Bills. The 2015 Bills are better than this. \nThe franchise has made gradual, impressive headway toward shedding its 21st-century persona of being Not Nearly Good Enoughs. \nBut it’s a results-based league, and they are what they are until they show they aren’t. \nAnd don’t be distracted by all that post-game whining by the Bills -- insinuations lodged with tempers still flared, that officials are out to get them. \nFact is, the Bills played badly in every phase of the game throughout the decisive first half Sunday, and deserved to trail 16-3. \nThe Bills’ focus needs to be on owning that, and fixing that. \nBuffalo’s offence -- so vibrant, clever and unstoppable in a 41-14 win at Miami last week -- sputtered from the start. By halftime? Two first downs, 1-of-8 on third downs, 78 total yards. After halftime, quarterback Tyrod Taylor and co. weren’t much better. \nHead coach Rex Ryan’s supposedly vaunted defence was a disappointment. It’s been decidedly far from dominant in both Buffalo losses. \nNew York led by 13 at the intermission as much because the Bills defence allowed Giants running backs Rashad Jennings and Andre Williams to gash them for 64 yards, as quarterback Eli Manning calmly directed a creative Giants attack that gained 171 yards. \nBills pass rushers didn’t lay a hand on Manning in that decisive first half: zero sacks, zero QB hits. Alas, that’s only a tiny regression from the Bills’ miserable first-half performance against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots two weeks ago, when at least then they recorded one whole QB hit. \nSo enough with all the talk of this being one of the best defences ever. Or in the league this year. Right now, the Bills possess only the third best defence in their own division, after the Patriots and New York Jets. \nBuffalo’s undisciplined play is as concerning as anything: 17 penalties for 135 yards. \nThe Bills lost all poise late in the fourth quarter, still with a chance to overcome a two-score deficit against a Giants team already twice an expert this young season in coughing up such leads. In so unravelling, the Bills showed they’re not-ready-for-playoffs players. \nHarsh but fair. \nPlayoff teams don’t come unglued like this: in a six-play span on a Giants drive that began with 6:22 left, Bills defenders were flagged twice for unsportsmanlike conduct (linebackers Preston Brown and Jerry Hughes) and once for unnecessary roughness (Brown again). \nRyan himself should have been flagged a few plays later for chasing officials down to about the 10-yard line -- more than 20 yards outside the coaching box -- and ripping into them. \nRyan and some defenders were anything but apologetic afterward. \nAsked how his team could play so undisciplined just two weeks after doing likewise against New England (14 penalties for 140 yards), Ryan got his back right up and barked in full defiance: \n“Well I’m going to tell you something: I’m proud of the way this team played. Now, can we play a lot smarter? Absolutely.” \nThen he kept pounding his fist into his news-conference lectern for emphasis. \n“But I’ll take a team that will fight over a team that won’t -- that’ll sit back and take it -- any day of the week. And bring on the next team. So that’s how I look at it. Give me a team that’s got some FIGHT and will COMPETE to the very end -- right, wrong or indifferent, no matter how good the officiating is, or whatever. Makes no difference to me. I’ll take a team with some competitive fight and some spirit. \n“(Is) 17 penalties ridiculous? Absolutely. One-hundred percent ridiculous. And so you can say what you want … I’m proud of this team. We’ll keep fighting, and eventually we’ll find a way to win.” \nTenth-year defensive tackle Kyle Williams, usually the voice of reason in the Bills locker room, similarly was in no mood to accept blame. \n“I would say that New England was definitely the low point, because there were definitely a lot of things going on out there today, from a lot of different perspectives -- a lot of things you get in trouble for talking about -- so we’ll just leave it at that.” \nOnly Williams didn’t leave it at that. \n“Obviously, we do have to be better. But a lot of people have to be better.” \nLike the officials, he all but said. \n“Whether (all the penalties are) legitimate or not, they’re looking for things … How do (we) change it? You have to just be able to walk away. And the bad thing is, the reputation is out. \n“There’s different things, whether it be from the other team knowing, so they can goad you into a couple of things, and you have to be able to move away from that. And the officials are looking for certain things. \n“We have to be choir boys.” \nReporters who were scrumming Williams in that quickly emptied Bills locker room kept asking for more details, and Williams kept obliging. \n“Obviously we can’t have an open discourse about whether it’s the other team, or officials, or anything like that -- because of all the rules, and they got onto you and all that stuff. But a lot of things have to be better. And it’s not just us.” \nAt least centre Eric Wood, a seventh-year Bill, refused “to feed into” such talk. \n“I’m sure that’s a fact,” Wood said of the Bills now having a reputation for playing fraught-with-infractions football. \n“But we need to play more disciplined, and that will handle itself. We’ve done that twice, where we’ve really put ourselves in bad positions with penalties this year. \n“And it’s got to stop, now.” \nSame with the inconsistency. Otherwise, the Bills won’t escape what they’ve been since last making the playoffs in 1999. \nIncurably inconsequential.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:13:25.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
