Reuters/Dinuka Liyanawatte. 2 of 2 right \nCOLOMBO West Indies' seam trio wreaked havoc on Sri Lanka to leave the hosts wobbling on 54-4 at lunch on the first day of the second test at P Sara Oval on Thursday. \nJerome Taylor, who came through a late fitness test after fears about a groin problem, gave the West Indies the perfect start by striking with the fourth ball of the morning to dismiss Kaushal Silvam caught behind for a duck. \nThe batsman was given out by the television official after the on-field umpires had ignored the tourists appeals for a slight nick. \nOpener Dimuth Karunaratne (13) was next to go in the 10th over after skipper Jason Holder trapped him leg before with an angled delivery from around the wicket, which the Sri Lankan failed to overturn after asking for a review. \nDebutant Kusal Mendis followed three balls later after another successful review by the West Indies, leaving the hosts in trouble on 34-3. The 20-year-old batsman, starting ahead of out-of-form Lahiru Thirimanne, wafted at a delivery from Kemar Roach to go for 13. \nSri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews (14), who had won the toss and opted to bat, then fell just before the lunch break when he edged a Holder delivery to Kraigg Brathwaite at second slip, which again required television replays before a decision was ratified. \nMilinda Siriwardana joined Dinesh Chandimal (11 not out) at the crease and saw off the final three balls of the session without scoring before lunch was called. \nSri Lanka, who won the first test by an innings and six runs in Galle on Saturday, had opted to start all-rounder Dilruwan Perera over Tharindu Kaushal, while the tourists handed a debut to left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican in place of quick Shannon Gabriel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:41:45.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
