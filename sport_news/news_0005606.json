Michigan State lost several critical players, including left tackle Jack Conklin. Penn State's top two tailbacks went down.\nNorthwestern and Minnesota, which will meet Saturday at Ryan Field, avoided painful defeats to Mid-American Conference teams but still endured painful victories. Each team lost a half-dozen players to a variety of ailments.\n\"We've been decimated a little bit by injures,\" said Gophers coach Jerry Kill, close to a woman declaring she is a little bit pregnant.\nKill is among the Big Ten's most forthcoming when it comes to dispensing injury updates. The others: Nebraska's Mike Riley, Purdue's Darrell Hazell, Ohio State's Urban Meyer and Indiana's Kevin Wilson.\n\"It's my opinion that if everybody watching on TV and everybody in the stadium sees a guy get hurt, you might as well say he got hurt,\" Riley said. \"It won't be a secret, anyway.\"\nSaid Meyer: \"There's an obligation to the players' family and the football team. Everyone else is next. We're usually pretty good. I'll tell you if a kid is out or doubtful. I get upset when I hear 'sources say.' I want to find out who those sources are and get rid of them. Sometimes kids tweet out stuff, too.\"\nKill disclosed that cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun had an MRI but will not require knee surgery. He also said safety Damarius Travis (hamstring) and tight end Lincoln Plsek (back) will miss Saturday's game against Northwestern but that receiver Drew Wolitarsky has been cleared after suffering a concussion against Ohio.\n\"At the end of the day, (people) are going to find out,\" said Kill, adding that's he's OK giving injury info on every position but quarterback, preferring to keep defensive coordinators guessing.\nOn the North Korea end in terms of dispensing info are Northwestern's Pat Fitzgerald, Penn State's James Franklin, Iowa's Kirk Ferentz, Maryland's Randy Edsall and Michigan's Jim Harbaugh, who might not tell you what day it is.\nAsked if he prefers the NFL or college system of (not) reporting injuries, Harbaugh paused nine seconds before replying: \"I don't know. I haven't decided that yet.\"\nAfter Smith went down against BYU, Harbaugh did say that X-rays were negative but declined to specify the injury, saying: \"He'll be working through that soreness.\"\nMichigan State's Mark Dantonio falls in the middle of the debate, occasionally saying he does not talk about injuries.\n\"But if a guy is out for the season,\" he said Tuesday, \"we let people know. Sometimes it's a sensitive issue because maybe that young man is not ready for that type of exposure. On the flip side, young people heal very, very fast and you never know if a guy is out on Tuesday, can he play on Saturday? Everybody seems to always want more (info). To me, more is less.\"\nDantonio disclosed that Conklin's knee injury is not a season-ender and that receiver Monty Madaris would be able to return \"soon\" from an undisclosed injury.\nFitzgerald actually sends out a weekly injury report on Thursdays that once listed the suspect body part. Now the preferred lingo is borrowed from the NHL — upper-body and lower-body.\nAnd the injury report is not gospel, considering how Fitzgerald downplayed injuries to running back Venric Mark before the 2013 opener at Cal and quarterback Dan Persa before the 2011 season. Northwestern's marketing department built a Heisman Trophy campaign around Persa, sending out seven-pound purple dumbbells to drum up publicity for a guy who did not suit up until October.\n\"A lot of our bloggers are students, so if a guy is walking around with a boot on his ankle, 20 years ago, nobody would say anything,\" Fitzgerald said. \"Now it's a tweet and maybe a SnapChat picture. It's a new world. As coaches you want to be as honest as you can but not sacrifice or compromise your players. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.\"\nAlong those lines, Fitzgerald is keeping info on left tackle Geoff Mogus and safety Godwin Igwebuike under wraps.\nAsked about Northwestern's injuries Tuesday, Fitzgerald simply replied: \"We feel like we're getting better (and) I'll issue an injury report on Thursday.\"\nExtra points: Meyer said he has great respect for Indiana's Wilson, a pioneer of the no-huddle spread, having studied Wilson's 2000-01 offenses at Northwestern \"relentlessly.\" The coaches will match wits Saturday as Ohio State seeks its 18th straight victory and the Hoosiers vie for their first 5-0 start since their 1967 Rose Bowl team opened 8-0. … Not a good look at Maryland, where the Terrapins are reeling and Edsall was unaware of a Baltimore Sun report about a players-only meeting. \"That's news to me,\" Edsall said five hours after it happened. \"If something productive came out of it, I think that's great.\" … Odd stat: The home team has won just two of the last eight meetings in the Iowa-Wisconsin series. The teams meet Saturday in Madison.\ntgreenstein@tribpub.com\nTwitter @TeddyGreenstein\nPrivacy Policy College Football College Sports Northwestern Wildcats Big Ten Jim Harbaugh Michigan Wolverines Indiana Hoosiers", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560bee93/turbine/ct-big-ten-injuries-greenstein-spt-0930-20150929"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:19:49.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
