Not bad for a couple of guys who began their careers as special-teams standouts. Bostic's path to the Ring of Fame was improbable. Undersized, he went undrafted in 1980 despite earning All-ACC honors at Clemson.\nBostic initially decided to sign with Washington as a free agent, but changed his mind and signed with Philadelphia instead. Eagles coach Dick Vermeil cut him a month later. Then Redskins long-snapper Ted Fritsch fell out of his groove.\n\"Snapping the ball is a lot like shooting free throws or playing golf,\" Fritsch said after the Redskins released him one week before the 1980 season opener. \"You have to get in a groove and I'm out of it.\"\nFritsch made seven errant snaps on punts or field goals in the three weeks before his release.\n\"What a shame,\" Redskins coach Jack Pardee said. \"The best snapper in the league couldn't hit the side of a barn. We tried to let him work his way out of the problem and it didn't happen.\"\nThe Redskins signed Bostic to replace Fritsch.\nBostic made one high snap to punter Mike Connell in his NFL debut - on \"Monday Night Football\" against the Cowboys, no less - and was perfect the rest of the season.\nThe following year, coach Joe Gibbs described Bostic, who played only on special teams as a rookie, as the \"absolute shocker of training camp.\"\nHe beat out Bob Kuziel and Dan Peiffer for the starting center spot after third-round draft pick Russ Grimm was moved to guard to replace the injured Fred Dean.\n\"The way he's playing, he could be headed for the Hall of Fame,\" offensive coordinator Joe Bugel said.\nBostic, one of the famed \"Hogs\" offensive linemen, helped the Redskins to three Super Bowl titles in four appearances. After five knee operations, he announced his retirement in 1993 at age 35.\nBostic joins fellow Hogs Joe Jacoby and Grimm in the Ring of Fame.\nColeman was an 11th-round selection in 1979 out of Central Arkansas, but Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard knew he had found a gem in the linebacker.\nColeman would play 16 seasons in Washington; his 215 career games rank second on the franchise's all-time list behind Darrell Green.\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
