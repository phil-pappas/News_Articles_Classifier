He would've been there for Game 3, too, but he was in the air, making a 22-hour trip to Chicago. \nIncluding the wild-card game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Harburg went to three postseason games, all of which the Cubs won, he said. So when the team lost its first two games in New York, Harburg didn't give up — he decided to return. \n\"I hope I bring them some good luck,\" he said Tuesday. \"Thursday will be my birthday, so I hope I'm celebrating a comeback at Wrigley.\" \nThat wasn't the case as the Cubs playoff run ended Wednesday when they were swept 4-0 in the series. \nWhether Cubs games were home or away, the excitement, tension, celebration and sadness of the occasion could be collectively felt in Wrigleyville bars and at the ballpark. But what if you are away — in another town or country? \nNot everyone was able to come back like Harburg. These fans still watched from the far reaches of the globe, waking up at odd hours and hunting for Wi-Fi so they could revel in this season's excitement. \nBlake Klinedinst , Japan : Klinedinst is in the Navy and stationed in Zushi. The 35-year-old tunes in with the American Forces Network, or AFN, which broadcasts popular U.S. radio and television programs — like postseason games — to State Departmentworkers, diplomats and military members throughout the world. The time change in Japan — 14 hours ahead — can be manageable, though some games can air at 3 a.m. \"A bit early for me, but I tend to catch the last few innings.\" (Paul Sullivan) \nSam Dull , England: Dull is a Northwestern University student who is studying abroad at Queen of Mary University in London. The 20-year-old from Oak Park was able to catch a game at an English pub called Belushi's, a chain that promotes Chicago sports, but he keeps up with games mostly on his phone. \"Baseball is virtually nonexistent in England. American football is actually much more popular. (People watch the Super Bowl there.) Having lived right outside Chicago my whole life, it's very disappointing to miss the excitement around perhaps the most promising Cubs team I've yet to see.\" \nFrancesca Kelly , Georgia : Kelly and her husband, Ian Kelly, the U.S. ambassador to the country of Georgia, live in the capital Tbilisi and wake up around 4 a.m. to watch games on AFN. The National League Division Series was a little more exciting, though. \"The first game in the Mets-Cubs series, I got up at 4, took one look at the score and went back to bed,\" Francesca Kelly said.

Cubs fan Keis Ohtsuka gets playoff updates at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, where he lectures. (Keis Ohtsuka) \nKeis Ohtsuka , Australia : Ohtsuka, a psychologist and lecturer at Victoria University in the Australian seaport of Melbourne, gets Major League Baseball updates at work. \"I am sure that play-by-play is delayed by a several minutes. It is sort of like following a baseball game through Morse code.\" \nOhtsuka, who received a doctorate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said, \"I still remember the starting lineup of the1984 Cubs and the 1989 Cubs.\" \nDrew Cunnar , South Africa : Cunnar is an Air Force major who lives in Pretoria with his wife, Kathryn. The 44-year-old said he's been getting very little sleep as games can come on as late as 2:30 a.m., but he watches them anyway on his iPad. \"I have to admit, tonight I am wondering if giving up another night's sleep is worth it,\" he emailed Tuesday. \"WHAT!!! Of course it is…it's the Cubs. I have been in the Air Force for 26 years, and I have run into folks wearing Cubs gear as far as the Falkland Islands, Afghanistan and South Africa.\" \nMatt Ciesielski , Mexico : Ciesielski, 31, works for the U.S. Consulate General in Monterrey. Despite living outside the U.S., it's his fifth year as a season-ticket holder, and he made it to seven of the regular season games this year. When he's not visiting, he watches the games on MLB.TV. \"I am already set to return next weekend whether or not the Cubs are playing, but I did eye the calendar before I booked my flights and am hoping it pays off. If the Cubs are playing, I'll be in my seats.\" \nThomas Farrell , South Korea : Farrell works as a corporate English instructor and lives in the capital Seoul. To tune in, he watches games live through MLB. \"Due to the 14-hour time difference, you drink coffee and eat oatmeal or cereal instead of hot dogs, brats, nachos and beer while watching games. It has become so normal that it is actually a little strange to come stateside and watch the games when they are on in the afternoon or in the early evening. \" \nTracy Musacchio , Brazil : Musacchio, 38, is a foreign service officer living in Sao Paulo with her fiance, Cesar Gutierrez, a 33-year-old engineer. They watch the games and get the play-by-plays from MLB online. Musacchio said it's one of the ways her fiance has worked to improve his English. \"The other day he said to me that he's afraid that people are going to think he only started liking the Cubs because they're winning this year. (I don't think there's an exact Portuguese translation for 'fair weather fan.') Instead, he wants everyone to know that he's been following the Cubs all season, and he even bought a sweatshirt when we were in the States in April. He's rather addicted.\" \nSierra Mision , Ethiopia : Mision, 24, serves with the Peace Corps as a community health volunteer. There's no access to any American sports networks in the city of Agena, where she lives, so to watch live, she'd have to drive about six hours one way to catch games on TV at a Peace Corps regional office. \"The Chicago Peace Corps volunteers here are losing their collective minds. We want the Cubs to win, but not while we're here.\" \nInstead, they get updates via Facebook after the fact. Even then, Wi-Fi is spotty. The day after the Cubs clinched the NLDS, \"I danced all morning while getting ready for work,\" she said. \"My timeline was littered with Cubs posts, and it was magical. \n\"If they go to the World Series, I'm gonna park myself in the capital Addis Ababa for a week and relish the party in any way possible. I mean ... this is a once-a-century deal, I'll sacrifice the vacation days.\" \nHarburg, Wrigley Field: Though he ended up catching the close of the Cubs postseason run, Harburg said he was glad he made the trip as he lingered in the stadium after the loss. \n\"Not a single iota of regret for coming back,\" he said. \"It was fun to watch.\" \nInstead of ringing in his 32nd birthday in Wrigley, Harburg said, \"I'll have a dinner with the family.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:59:06.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
