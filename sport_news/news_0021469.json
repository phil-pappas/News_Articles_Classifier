Among N.L. series, it ranks as the highest rated LCS opener since Dodgers/Phillies in 2008 (5.1) and the most-watched since Cardinals/Mets in 2006 (8.5M). \nOverall, Game 1 scored the second-largest baseball audience on cable since the 2011 Division Series — trailing only this year’s Cubs/Pirates Wild Card game (8.3M). \nGiven the market disparity, it should be no surprise that Saturday’s NLCS opener topped Game 1 of the Blue Jays/Royals ALCS on FOX (4.0, 6.5M). This is the third time in the past four years, and the fourth time in the past six, that TBS has gotten off to a better start than FOX for the LCS. \nThrough Saturday, TBS has averaged a 3.6 rating and 5.9 million viewers for coverage of the National League playoffs — up 38% in ratings and 41% in viewership from last year and the network’s highest average at this point of the MLB Postseason since it began airing the event in 2007.
