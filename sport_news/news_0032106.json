When you see a situation, do you stop? And officers will tell you, as when I sat down and had coffee with four or five of ‘em … about how the news over the last 15 months have impacted their instincts. Do they stop or do they keep driving? When I stop here, is it going to be my career on the line?” the mayor said.\n“All of us who want officers to be proactive. [But], to be able to do community policing in a proactive way, we have to encourage them so it’s not their job on the line or that judgment call all the time that, if they stop, this could be a career-ender. If that happens, it’s going to have an impact and we’re seeing it. And that’s why every other police chief and mayor and U.S. attorney then applauded what I said because it is effective.”\nEmanuel then rattled off the statistics he remembers hearing at the meeting. They mirror the troubling trend in Chicago, where there were 359 murders through Sept. 27 compared with 296 through the same period of 2014 — a 21 percent increase, according to the Police Department.\n“In Milwaukee, homicides are up about 100 percent. As of last week, the St. Louis mayor talked about 60 percent. Louisville about 40 percent. When you’re seeing something like this all across the country and you see what happened in the last year, we have a challenge to continue to help our police officers be good police officers practicing community policing because it is having an impact on the safety we want to see,” the mayor said.\nLast week, Emanuel used the word “fetal” to describe the post-Ferguson effect. The closed-door comments, captured by a Washington Post reporter who was in the room, were his strongest to date on his view that Chicago cops have pulled back from aggressive policing.\n“We have allowed our police department to get fetal and it is having a direct consequence,” Emanuel said then, obviously speaking more freely than he would back home in Chicago.\n“They have pulled back from the ability to interdict … they don’t want to be a news story themselves, they don’t want their career ended early, and it’s having an impact.”\nDean Angelo, president of Chicago’s Fraternal Order of Police, took offense to the mayor’s choice of words.\n“I don’t believe the description ‘fetal’ properly describes anyone working in law enforcement. That being said, I do believe that officers are well aware of being recorded. Members regularly relate to us that nearly every traffic and street stop are being recorded,” Angelo said.\n“I would ask those who might believe the women and men of the CPD are no longer proactively policing, who is responsible for removing [thousands of] guns from our streets?”\nThe criticism obviously touched a nerve with Emanuel. Which is why the mayor launched into a lengthy explanation of his remarks because, “I don’t want people misconstruing and taking not only what I said out of context but changing what I said.”\nEmanuel noted that New York City Police Chief Bill Bratton spoke right before him about, what Bratton called the “YouTube effect” on policing.\n“Other mayors as well as police chiefs talked how police today being in the public eye in a way they were never ten years ago–let alone five years ago, let alone 20 years ago–it is having an impact post-Ferguson, post-Baltimore, post-New York, post Cleveland. All of 1em were talking about that,” the mayor said.\n“I said to the attorney general I met with officers of the 10th District and one officer said explicitly when I’m driving by, I have to think about whether I want to be on the news and what it means to my career. I brought that example up. I then said to the attorney general I am supporting our officers because our officers do a good job in community policing and I ask you to speak up on behalf of officers throughout the country who are doing a good job practicing community policing.”\nThe mayor added, “When there’s a problem, obviously there’s a problem. When there are officers doing exactly their job–like we have officers who play football with kids just doing pick up and it was caught on video—we have to highlight those officers because they’re holding up the principle of community policing and they have to be encouraged to continue to do their job.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/k83yPE1DXjc?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:50:07.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
