I need to figure it out a little bit. I just need to see some putts going in the hole. \n“I think it’s more mental than anything else. Whenever you don’t see anything go in, it makes it harder and harder each and every hole that goes by. \n“So hopefully (I) find something on the putting green tonight and then if I can get off to a good start in terms of holing putts tomorrow, hopefully that can feed through ... and I can go from there.” \nLeader Steele, whose lone victory came at the 2011 Texas Open, is coming off a solid season in which he posted a runner-up finish at his home event, the Humana Classic, a tie for 12th at the PGA Championship and finished 50th in the FedEx Cup standings. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:06:46.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
