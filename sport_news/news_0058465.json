Now you will never forget to take markers along when you putt.\"\nHe developed the patent-pending NEVER 4 GET to offer a convenient way to carry a ball marker. The design ensures that you remember to take a marker along when heading to the green to putt. This saves the user from having to go back to his or her golf bag in order to retrieve a marker, which eliminates hassles and frustrations. The unit provides added peace of mind. Additionally, the marker is designed to be compact and easily portable.\nThe original design was submitted to the Jacksonville office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
