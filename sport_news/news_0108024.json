(AP) â€” A person familiar with the situation says the New Orleans Saints have decided to make a change at kicker, releasing Zach Hocker and replacing him with Kai Forbath.\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Monday because the roster move has not been announced.\nHocker missed two field goal attempts during Thursday night's Saints victory over Atlanta, dropping him to 9-of-13 on the season. Two weeks earlier, Hocker had missed a potential game-winning field goal against Dallas, hitting the left upright. However, the Saints won that game in overtime.\nForbath had kicked for the Washington Redskins from 2012 until his release last month and has made 60- of 69 field goal attempts in his career. He hit 24 of 27 attempts last season.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
