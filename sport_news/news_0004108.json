I don't give any more answers about Wayne Rooney. I am sick of them,\" he added.\nVan Gaal also confirmed that Antonio Valencia has picked up a foot injury during the game, potentially ruling him out of Wednesday's League Cup tie against Middlesbrough.\n\"He had a kick on his foot in the first half... but then he played further.
