Liverpool is not an easy job now. Ancelotti is a great manager, but he's gone to clubs where you're expected to win trophies. \n\"It's a difficult job now at Liverpool, getting back into the top four. Forget talking about the title. I think it needs someone with that energy and drive to get the club back to where it wants to be, and I think Jurgen Klopp is that man.\" \nFormer Reds captain Souness also believes Klopp would be a better fit than Ancelotti. \"When you think about it logically, Ancelotti's last three jobs were Chelsea, PSG and Real Madrid,\" he said. \n\"They can go out and buy the best players in the world. They have more spending power that anyone else out there. So Klopp might be a better fit. At Dortmund, they continually lost their better players at the end of each season. So he might be a better fit, coming in and working with younger players.\" \nRedknapp, meanwhile, feels Klopp would be a \"great\" appointment. \"I think that Jurgen Klopp has that aura about him,\" he told Sky Sports News HQ. \"He has that special something that some managers have.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:55:55.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
