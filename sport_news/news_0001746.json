It was the second time in the past few months.\n\"This is unacceptable. It continues to be a burden on the families, business, residents and visitors,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said.\nThe problem of recurring boil water advisories happens as water pressure drops in response to electrical power issues at the water treatment plant.\n\"We are now working with third-party independent local and national power experts on implementing a short-term plan,” Landrieu said.\nThe Sewerage and Water Board estimates the costs of the interim solutions at $3 million. There is a laser focus on making the water system less dependent on commercial power from Entergy. Since last week, repairs were completed on the S&WB’s two 25-cycle pumps. The repairs are to help the system reduce its reliance on the commercially provided 60-cycle power, and S&WB has begun shifting more of its power load to its own system.\n\"We've raised that level of power on a daily basis that we've self-generated. We'll never be totally unable to use commercial power, but for the most part we can use more of ours and [have] control,” said S&WB Executive Director Cedric Grant.\nHe said another priority involves tying water pumps together.\n\"To provide continuous pressure among the systems, so it's not subject to those outside fluctuations,” Grant said.\nGrant wants the best national experts available to help in rectifying the problems.\n\"Similar to the guy that was called upon by the Superdome, post Superdome event this was a national forensic electric expert that did an analysis,” Grant said.\n“We have worked with the Sewerage and Water Board in the past, and we will continue to work with Mayor Landrieu, the Sewerage and Water Board and any third parties to further improve facilities and enhance reliability,” the statement reads.\nPreviously, there had been some public finger-pointing following the electrical and water pressure problems. Landrieu said that is not his focus. Instead he wants to end the problems.\n\"If it's on Entergy's side, Entergy will fix it. If it's on our side, we'll fix it. I think we need to get in an argument about whose it is. It's a knowable thing, and we are going to know it now,” Landrieu said.\nFor the long term, the Sewerage and Water Board has implemented a $3.3 billion capital improvement program. It involves more than 600 projects across the city. And even as the city works to address the problems, the mayor could not guarantee that there will not be future drinking water advisories.\n“There's always a possibility it can occur again. People should be prepared. The one thing I don't want people to lose sight of is the reason we have boil water advisories is so we take the absolute guarantee that we will not have unsafe drinking water,” Landrieu said.\nThe S&WB believes the short-term solutions can be completed in the next six to nine months.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
