One thing that didn’t change was his name atop the leaderboard at the Frys.com Open at Napa, Calif.\nBrendan Steele had to settle for pars on the closing three holes. He had a 2-under 70 — seven shots higher than the opening round — but all that mattered was a two-shot lead. Steele was at 11-under 133. Rory McIlroy shot a 71 and was six shots behind. \nKO’S BIRDIE: Lydia Ko took advantage of Sung Hyun Park’s struggles to take the lead in the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship held in Incheon, South Korea. The second-ranked Ko made an 18-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a 7-under 65 and a one-stroke lead over Lexi Thompson. Park followed her course-record 62 with a 74 to drop two shots behind.\nSOLID FINISH: Wes Short Jr. birdied three of the last four holes for a 5-under 67 and a one-stroke lead in the Champions Tour’s San Antonio Championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:42.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
