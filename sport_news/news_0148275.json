I am kind of like the center.” \nCougars coach Francisco Cisneros was frustrated with getting the tie instead of the win. \n“I felt like tonight we let two points get away,” Cisneros said of the difference between a win and a tie in the standings. “We had the lead twice and a couple of defensive miscues got them back in the game and that last goal on the direct kick hurt more because we were up a man and we had the lead late in the game. \n“Then we make a foul and there is not much you can do about that one. It was a nice goal – he placed it right in the corner, it had some pace and nobody was going to stop that. I am just very disappointed we lost two points tonight.” \nWith Weston Ranch and Oakdale having completed the last game of the first half of the league schedule the Cougars are in second with 16 points and the Mustangs are tied with Sierra at 17. The Timberwolves have played one more game than Weston Ranch and Oakdale. \n\nWeston Ranch 3, Sierra 1 \nNery Guerra, Antonio Rodriguez and Ariel Silva each had a goal for the Cougars. \nOscar Guitron scored the Timberwolves goal off of an assist from David Huerta.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:08:43.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
