(AP) - The American Queen riverboat will spend more time in Memphis in 2016 as demand rises for overnight cruises on the lower Mississippi River.\nThe Commercial Appeal ( http://bit.ly/1NZzRfL ) reports that sales of next year's cruises are up 200 percent over this time last year, and American Queen operators say more Memphis-New Orleans trips are a big reason.\nAmerican Queen Steamboat Co.'s high expectations for 2016 come as it basks in the limelight of a Conde Nast Traveler Best Cruise Lines Readers' Choice Award. Readers of the travel publication ranked the American Queen No. 6 in river cruises, the only American company honored in that category.\nThe company is based in Memphis because city government helped finance the 436-passenger paddle-wheeler's purchase and return to service in 2012. The company employs about 225 people.\nInformation from: The Commercial Appeal, http://www.commercialappeal.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
