(AP Photo/Kathy ... more > By MIKE FITZPATRICK - Associated Press - Monday, October 12, 2015 \nNEW YORK (AP) - All of a sudden, Matt Harvey’s postseason debut contains an extra layer of drama. \nWouldn’t seem normal any other way. \nWith the New York Mets still steamed about a late slide by Chase Utley that broke Ruben Tejada’s right leg, Harvey is set to start a pivotal Game 3 on Monday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first playoff contest at Citi Field. \nWhether the Mets will see Utley anytime soon was uncertain. Major League Baseball on Sunday night suspended the second baseman for Games 3 and 4, with executive Joe Torre calling it an illegal slide. \nUtley planned to appeal, according to agent Joel Wolfe. That would allow Utley to play until the hearing process is complete. Chances are, MLB would try to resolve the matter Monday before the series resumes. \nHours before the penalty was announced, the natural question was whether Harvey would retaliate against Utley or perhaps some other Dodgers hitter. \n“I think the most important thing is going out and doing my job and doing what’s best for the team. For me, in my mind, that’s going out and pitching a long game and being out there as long as I can, and keeping zeros on the board,” Harvey said. “But you know, as far as sticking up for your teammates, I think being out there and doing what’s right is exactly what I’m going to do.” \nThe first thing he needs to do is show up on time. \nHarvey missed a mandatory workout last week and apologized after arriving late. The misstep drew a curt comment from Mets captain David Wright and the latest round of criticism for a star pitcher who is constantly in the headlines for one reason or another. \nThe next could still be his latest showdown with Utley, a thorn in the Mets’ side for more than a decade while he played for NL East rival Philadelphia. \nThe 36-year-old Utley has a part-time role with the Dodgers after they acquired him Aug. 19. But before the ban was handed down, manager Don Mattingly said Utley might start Monday because of the lefty-righty matchup and his good numbers against Harvey (6 for 18 with a homer). \n“He will definitely be a possibility,” Mattingly said Sunday evening. \nThe best-of-five NL Division Series is tied 1-all after Utley’s takeout slide swung Game 2 in Los Angeles, keying a four-run rally in the seventh inning Saturday night that sent the Dodgers to a 5-2 victory. \n“Obviously the replay, everybody saw that it was more of a tackle than anything,” Harvey said. “We’re all feeling for Ruben. We’re going to pick him up, and we’re excited to be back at home.” \nMattingly said Utley tried to reach out and apologize to Tejada, who will be replaced at shortstop by Wilmer Flores. Matt Reynolds, a Triple-A infielder who has never played in the majors, was on his way to New York as a potential addition to the roster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:29:35.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
