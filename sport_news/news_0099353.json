Paul Lambert (left) and Sam Allardyce (right) \nNot only would handing Sunderland their first win of the season add to the pressure on Pulis, it would also drag Albion within two points of the bottom three. \nThe Palace game sparked a furious response from fans, but it wasn’t so much the result as the manner of defeat that angered them. \nSetting up so defensively away has served Pulis well this season, and Yannick Bolasie’s header and Yohan Cabaye’s penalty are the only goals Albion have conceded on their travels so far. \nIn contrast, Pulis’ men have picked up just one point in four games at The Hawthorns, but there is the feeling that the home faithful want to see a performance with attacking intent tomorrow as well as a victory. Two players that could add some drive going forwards are wingers Callum McManaman and Serge Gnabry. \nGnabry curled a stunning goal into the top corner for Germany’s under-21s against the Faroe Islands earlier this week, and with James Morrison a doubt, he or McManaman could feature. \nSunderland fans may be more focused on the other wing, where James McClean is likely to start his first game against his former club since criticising them in the way they handled his decision not to wear a poppy on an embroidered shirt in 2012. \n“They didn’t understand,” said McClean earlier this year. \n“To them, I was disrespecting their country, disrespecting their fallen heroes, disrespecting their culture. I was getting booed every touch. \n“When I asked to be allowed to speak about it, I was told that that was a bad idea, not to say anything and let it blow over. \n“So it was kind of brushed under the table and I felt that that was more for the club’s benefit than mine.” What do you think? Log in and start commenting \nBlowing hot and cold for Albion this season, McClean could use a match-winning performance at The Hawthorns and will be spurred on by his history with the North East side. \nAlthough Albion haven’t won any of the past three meetings between the two teams, drawing both league games last year and losing the one before that, their record against Sunderland in the Premier League is fantastic. \nAlbion won seven and drew one of the eight games before those last three, and in the last ten meetings, have lost just once.
