The Poland international has been in stupendous form recently and has scored 15 goals in his last seven matches. \"They are different players, in different positions. Cristiano plays offensively on the left side, Messi centrally. I play up front. Of course I work back, take part in combinations and don't wait 90 minutes for the ball. I want to participate in the game. I am 27 and I want to be better every year, score more goals. My best time comes now,\" Lewandowski was Quote: d as saying. \"Hopefully, it will carry on as long as possible! To be a striker, sometimes it is not easy. To reach the crucial situations, I have to fight in every game. My colleagues also take an important role. You are running, see the chance, but you do not get the ball. But you have to stay positive and concentrate fully.\" The striker also spoke of his training schedule and what makes him one of the feared forwards in the world but added it was too early to comment on whether he can bag the European Golden Shoe. “I am working very hard, with the team, in every training session and after training. In my position I have to fight, also with the defenders. Of course, technique is above everything but strength is also important for me,” he said. — IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:12:04.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
