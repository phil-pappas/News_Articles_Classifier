The offer of 42.15 pounds a share is 11 percent more than AB InBev's initial proposal and 28 percent higher than SABMiller's stock price before the bid was announced Sept. 16.\nAB InBev is trying to create what it calls \"the first truly global beer company\" by combining its business, which is focused on the Americas and Western Europe, with SABMiller's brands in Africa and Eastern Europe. The deal would create a company with 31 percent of the global beer market.\nTensions surrounding the proposal have risen in recent days, with SABMiller Chairman Jan du Plessis saying that AB InBev was \"very substantially undervaluing\" his company.\nIn response, AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito accused SABMiller's board of refusing \"to meaningfully engage with us.\" On Thursday, he appealed directly to SABMiller shareholders, asking them to \"voice their views\" and not \"let this opportunity slip away.\"\nAltria Group, SABMiller's largest shareholder, said Thursday that it supports AB InBev's offer and believes the merger \"would create significant value.\" Altria, whose companies include cigarette-maker Phillip Morris USA, owns 27 percent of SABMiller.\nAssociated Press\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune SABMiller Anheuser-Busch InBev", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617c114/turbine/ct-sabmiller-investors-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:33:02.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
