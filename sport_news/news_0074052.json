Accordingly, an operation was carried out on her.\nThe Philippine Embassy here visited Rina last Tuesday.\n Rina from Kabuntalan, Maguindanao, was allegedly ill-treated. She is actually 17 years old as against 25, the age mentioned in her passport. This was disclosed earlier by her to a Filipina that works at the SWA.\nJohn Leonard Monterona, M-ME's regional director, said: “We call on POEA chief, Hans Cacdac, to take immediate action against the recruiting agency for violation of household service worker (HSW) rules. The Philippines embassy and labor officials were informed about Rina’s critical condition”.\nAccording to Monterona, recruitment of underage overseas foreign workers is still rampant and that on an average, three cases are reported in a month. He suggested formation of an inter-agency consisting of representatives from the Philippines embassy, Assistance to the Nationals (ATN), DoLE-POLO-OWWA and DSWD to oversee the recruitment process.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:17:22.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
