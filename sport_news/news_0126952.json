Latest Basketball Features Top 25 Forwards In New Mexico: New Mexico is known as the land of the guards or the 6-foot post. Well, this season we could see a shift as we have some solid forwards or \"centers\" (using center loosely) in New Mexico that could change the landscape for a season or two. DALTON PRIVETT - DORA kay, we didn't get away from releasing a 6'2\" forward but from the small school division we had to mention one of the top players from the division... New Subscriber?

We take a stab before the season to predict the top 25 guards in the state of New Mexico. No. 23 FRANCIS CASTILLO Y MULERT - When looking at guards you have to like what Castillo y Mulert brings to the table.
