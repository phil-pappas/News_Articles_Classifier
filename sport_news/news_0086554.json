He leans out of a black Lakota helicopter to which he is strapped to shoot video that is shown on the stadium’s huge scoreboard screen.\nFalzone also orchestrates what is called a stack of jumpers out of the helicopter at specified intervals. Maintaining proper spacing is critical; a midair collision could be catastrophic. Each jumper free-falls for 10 to 15 seconds before opening the main parachute based on a reading from an altimeter, which measures height above ground. Each is also equipped with a reserve parachute and an inflatable life jacket to allow for a landing in the Hudson River, which runs next to the picturesque stadium.\nThe jumper gains control through steering toggles attached by lines to a parachute that matches Army’s black-and-gold colors.\n“You need to control your descent rate as well as your forward penetration rate, how fast you are going forward,” said David Hart, a senior from Endwell, N.Y., who is on the team. Some members exhibited such great control during a recent practice that it appeared they were almost hanging in midair.\nJumpers enter their landing pattern at approximately 600 feet. The final approach is made at about 125 feet. At that point, the newly designed Black Knights icon comes into view. So does the crowd. The jumpers’ focus, critical throughout, is tested as never before.\n“You hear the crowd erupt when the first person lands,” Hart said. “It’s a thrill like no other. It’s motivating. You want to hit as close to the target as possible.”\nA majority achieve the goal of “smashing the 50.” According to Falzone, only two jumpers missed Michie Stadium. Sudden wind gusts forced them to land unharmed at nearby Fort Putnam.\n“They turned away from the stadium because we say, ‘When in doubt, land out,’ ” Falzone said. “You don’t want to land in the stands.”\nThe only injury during Falzone’s six-year tenure as head coach occurred when a student made an unexpected visit to the library during practice, injuring his hip. He returned to jump again.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage College Football Games to Watch on Saturday OCT. 9, 2015 On College Football: Longhorns See Sooners as a Cure for Their Ills OCT. 10, 2015 At Northwestern, Defense Has Become Seriously Fun OCT. 9, 2015 Beer Here!
