But Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I thought we had some of our best practices of the season and it carried over to the game.\" \nAs usual, Cinnaminson got strong work from junior quarterback Shaun Davilla, who ran for two scores and passed for another. \nThe 6-foot-2, 185-pound Davilla, also a top defensive back, has run for 567 yards and eight touchdowns and passed for 598 yards and seven touchdowns this season. \n\"He's a player,\" said Patrizi, whose team is 5-1 and No. 24 in The Inquirer Top 25. \nPatrizi also had high praise for junior lineman Keith Swartley and junior all-purpose player Frank Stepnowski, who scored three touchdowns on Friday night. \n\"He's our Mr. Versatility,\" Patrizi said of Stepnowski. \nCinnaminson's top playmakers are juniors. The Pirates also have a promising freshman in Rashad Raymond, who has 279 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns this season. \nPatrizi also reports that the Pirates' junior varsity and freshmen teams are undefeated. \n\"We're in a real good cycle right now,\" Patrizi said. \nAnother pulse-pounder. Highland played its fourth tight game in a row, emerging with a 35-34 victory over Deptford on Friday night on the strength of a blocked extra point. \nTwo of them, actually. \nHighland junior Jerry Fuller blocked an extra-point attempt with 1 minute, 34 seconds remaining to help the Tartans improve to 3-3 in advance of this Friday's game against No. 5 Camden Catholic. \n\"He blocked one earlier in the game, too,\" Highland coach Brian Leary said. \nThe back-and-forth game featured great work by Highland senior quarterback Gabe Martorano, who passed for three scores and ran for two. \n\"It was a great game for Gabe,\" Leary said. \"He knows people have been saying if you stop [junior running back] Orlando Council, you stop Highland and he showed we can throw the ball too.\" \nHighland has been involved in four straight one-score games, with losses to Triton and Woodrow Wilson and victories over Bishop Eustace and Deptford. \n\"After the game, everybody was just saying, 'What a great game,'\" Leary said. \nTough loss. Holy Cross will be without star senior two-way end Matt Correnti for the remainder of the season. \nCorrenti suffered a season-ending knee injury in the Lancers' 35-34 win over Cinnaminson on Oct. 9, according to Holy Cross coach Frank Holmes. \nHolmes said the Lancers' \"missed [Correnti] dearly\" in Friday night's 28-7 loss to Willingboro. \nHolmes said Correnti should be cleared to participate in wrestling this winter. Correnti was second in the state last season a 195 pounds and has accepted a wrestling scholarship to Rutgers. \nMilestone moment, Part 1. Paulsboro and Woodbury will mark 100 years of competition when the Red Raiders visit the Thundering Herd Saturday at noon. \nPaulsboro has a 53-41 edge in a series that began in 1915. The teams have tied three times - 6-6 in 1934, 7-7 in 1961 and 6-6 in 1975. \nThe teams also have met 10 times in the South Jersey Group 1 tournament, with Paulsboro winning six although Woodbury has won three of four sectional championship games (in 1988, 1989 and 2009) between the programs. \nMilestone moment, Part 2. West Deptford coach Clyde Folsom can win his 200th game at the school when the Eagles visit Collingswood on Friday night. \nFolsom is 199-59-2 in his 25th season at West Deptford. He was 34-11-1 at Bishop Eustace in the late 1980s before taking over the Eagles' program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:49:19.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
