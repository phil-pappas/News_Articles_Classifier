Comment Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 7:30 PM PITKIN — The Elizabeth Lady Bulldogs were in control early. But the Pitkin Lady Tiger press proved to be too much in the second half as the home crowd left happy from the Pitkin Hall of Fame Classic as the Lady Tigers downed the Lady Bulldogs, 51-35. It was a balanced effort from Pitkin, who has six players score at least five points in the contest, five of those scoring at least eight points, much to the pleasure of veteran head coach Dana Wisby. Elizabeth was able to jump out to a 12-11 lead at the end of the first period as Haiden Perry dominated in the post. Using her 6-foot frame to her advantage, Perry scored seven points in the opening stanza. Hali Thompson gave Pitkin a 14-12 lead to open the second with a three-pointer, but a Perry basket tied it up at 14-14. But the Lady Tigers got five points from both Shelby Lentz and Brianne Perkins during a 14-4 run, while saw Pitkin take a 28-18 lead into the halftime intermission. It was all Pitkin in the third quarter as Emily Hardisty, Brilee Nolen and Madison McDonald proved to be effective getting to the basket and scoring, allowing the Lady Tigers to open up a 49-29 lead going into the final eight minutes. The fourth period was very sloppy for both teams as Pitkin held on for the win. Perkins led the Lady Tigers with 11 points, while Nolen finished with 10 points. Lentz chipped in with nine points, while Hardisty and McDonald each added eight points. Thompson notched five points. Perry finished with nine points to pace the Lady Bulldogs, while Katie Jo McBride accounted for seven points.
