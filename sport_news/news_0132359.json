(Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com) Buy Photo \nThe routine has become familiar for Becker senior Gabe Dertinger and his fellow starters this season. \nGet out to a big lead, then call it an early evening while the younger players on the roster close things out. \nIt was the case again Friday night as the Bulldogs — the top-ranked team in the state in Class 4A — opened up a 34-point halftime lead and went on to beat St. Cloud Cathedral 62-0 at Husky Stadium. \n“We got to play a lot of people again tonight and that was good,” said Dertinger, who rushed for 126 yards — all of it in the first half — and a touchdown. \n“I have a younger brother who plays. And I love seeing him in there doing well. We’re just playing at a really high level right now. That makes it a lot of fun.” \nDertinger’s brother Lucas, a sophomore, had a 15-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. \nIt marked the sixth time in seven games this season that Becker (7-0) has scored 40 points or more, and the fourth time they have scored 54 points or better. The Bulldogs’ average margin of victory this fall is 43.3 points. \nDertinger and company have only really been tested once — in a 29-22 win at Zimmerman on Sept. 11. \nBut head coach Dwight Lundeen said that doesn’t mean the team has grown complacent. \n“As a coach, you always worry about that,” Lundeen said. “But we’re still working hard every day in practice. We’ve played seven really good ballgames now. I haven’t been disappointed with our effort in any of them. We may not have done everything exactly right. But we’ve been playing awfully well.” \nBecker is likely in for a bigger test when the Bulldogs play host to Albany in the regular-season finale at 7 p.m. next Thursday in Becker. The Huskies also improved to 7-0 Friday, beating Milaca 42-0. \n“That’s going to be a big game for us,” senior lineman Casey Vesledahl said. “They’re 7-0 too and they’re going to come in trying to run that quick Power I they do. We know it will be a challenge.” \nBeyond that game lies the postseason where the Bulldogs will attempt to defend their Class 4A state title. Those games, too, will present bigger challenges than Becker has faced thus far. \nBut the Bulldogs players say they are ready. \n“Everything has been clicking for us,” Dertinger said. “But we know we have to stay humble. We’re going to face some pretty good teams the rest of the way and we just have to focus on taking it one game at a time.” \nFirst quarter \nB — Beau Pauly 3 run (Lucas Dertinger kick) \nB — Jake Fobbe 13 pass from Andrew Stanger (L.
