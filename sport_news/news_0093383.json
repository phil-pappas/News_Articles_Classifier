They still have their forward platform but they’ve opened up their backs and they know they have talent there so they’re bringing them in. \n“They’ve got a bit of experience in Juan Martin Hernandez and (Marcello) Bosch. \n“They’ve been developing that game over two to three years now and they’re getting the fruits of that labour no doubt.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:32:37.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
