Pilcher , The Gazette October 1, 2015 | 4:48 pm \nCEDAR RAPIDS — Jalen Rima made an immediate impression in his first football game as a Cedar Rapids Prairie freshman. \nThe first two times he touched the ball resulted in kickoff returns for touchdowns. Rima has had a knack for the big play since and partiality for special teams play. \n“I can tell you the exact game,” Rima said. “We were playing Iowa City West at home. \n“I like (kickoff returns) the most because I think it’s the most exciting part and what I think I’m best at.” \nRima has proved to be an exciting playmaker whenever he has the ball, finding the end zone as a rusher, receiver and returner for the Hawks this season. The utility player and four-sport athlete has seven touchdowns, entering Friday night’s home game against Iowa City High. \nRima has produced some gaudy numbers this season, averaging 22 yards per touch on offense. He has 639 total yards, including 385 receiving yards on 13 catches, and seven touchdowns. All nine touchdowns have come in the last four weeks, including two special teams touchdowns as well. \n“I think I’m doing my best to help the team out,” said Rima, who is tied for sixth in Class 4A scoring with 54 points. “I’m not really worried about how I play. I’m just trying to help the team out and get some (wins) this year.” \nPrairie is 2-3 this season, but Rima is a vital component of its attack. He had more than 124 receiving yards and two TDs, including an 84-yard score, in a 57-7 win over Burlington. Rima had both rushing and receiving touchdowns in Week 3 and 4 games against Dubuque Senior and North Scott. \n“He is exceptionally talented,” first-year Prairie Coach Mark Bliss said. “He is the catalyst for our offense in terms of big-play potential. \n“He’s started to get a lot of looks from a lot of colleges, because of what he has done the last few weeks.” \nBliss didn’t hear much about Rima shortly after he was named to the post in February. He took notice in the spring when Rima captured 200- and 400-meter state track titles. \n“I wasn’t quite part of the picture yet and I hadn’t quite figured it out,” Bliss said. “When I got here this summer and started doing things in the summertime, I realized he was pretty gifted.” \nRima ignited in a second-week loss to Cedar Rapids Jefferson. He scored on a 94-yard kickoff return, 68-yard punt return and a 21-yard run. At least eight TDs have been longer than 20-yard plays. \nHe is always dangerous, tallying two TDs on three offensive touches against North Scott. Rima’s two scores last week came on three receptions. \n“I hope I can score every play,” said Rima, who plans to play football at the NCAA Division I level and is weighing his options. “I don’t think I’m going to. I just try to find the hole and run past everybody.” \nBliss said teams have started keying on Rima, double-teaming him on pass routes and kicking away from him on returns, and teammates have to play a bigger role to take advantage of their opportunities. Trevor Northrup has added 321 rushing yards and six TDs for Prairie, but coaches have to design different ways to call Rima’s number. \n“We try to be as creative as possible to put him in position to get the ball,” Bliss said. “We’ve done a decent job so far, but a kid like that you wish you could put it in his hands every play.” \nHis contributions are not limited to when he has the ball. Bliss said Rima throws blocks and carries out fakes as a decoy whenever asked and has “no complaints” about his effort. \n“He’s the ultimate team player,” Bliss said. “He was elected by his peers as a captain. The respect intertwines with those kids’ understanding that he’s trying to be a team player and leader.” \nRima’s success isn’t limited to football and track. He was a second-team all-Mississippi Valley Conference Mississippi Division baseball player, roaming center field and leading off for the Hawks. Rima was named honorable mention all-conference in basketball. He doesn’t experience an off-season and only gets five weeks off over the year. \n“I don’t mind it,” Rima said. “It keeps me busy.” \nThe biggest impact of being active is constantly being in shape. Rima has considered cutting back, but that has never lasted long enough to act. \n“It has a couple times when I’ve been really sore from not taking any breaks,” Rima said. “If I really thought about it, I wouldn’t know what to do without all these sports that I play.” \nRima’s focus is on football now and helping the Hawks getting back to a .500 record. The Little Hawks are 3-2, but both teams are 1-0 in 4A District 6 play. \n“Our kids have found ways to compete and do the best they can,” Bliss said. “For us to get a win last week was huge. Hopefully, we can build on that and continue to find ways to compete.” \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:42:57.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
