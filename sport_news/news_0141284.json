The Super Bowl champions won their seventh straight game, including the playoffs last season.\nThe Cowboys (2-3) lost their third straight without Romo and his top receiver, and backup Brandon Weeden lost his 11th in a row as a starter.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
