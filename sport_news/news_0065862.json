Bannister broke the sub four-minute mile and in the six months after that, 18 others did because he opened the eyes to what is possible. It was not a physical limitation, it was an idea, and that is what Jarryd Hayne has done - he's planted a different idea. A number of players are probably going to want to do what he's done.\"\nSullivan made the point Australia has had at least one AFL player in the NFL since the 1950s, and said playing in the NFL was not a new phenomenon for Australian athletes.\nAmerican dream: Former NRL player Jarryd Hayne. Photo: Getty Images\nAsked which current rugby league or AFL star he thought would be best suited to the NFL, Sullivan would not be drawn into specific players and said US talent scouts also would not risk such a thing.\n\"The talent is being looked at, but they're not going to talk about it until they pull the trigger,\" Sullivan said. \"Because recruiting and analysing talent gets very competitive, it will not be discussed because someone wants to find the diamonds in the rough on the other side of the world. It's just not discussed openly. Much of recruiting in the NFL is done in that way or in North America. We tend to say less and treat it like a corporate or military structure.\"\nSullivan likened the NFL's plan to expand its talent pool to that of the NBA, and will be encouraging NFL franchises to look into the calibre of athletes, like Hayne, Australia can produce.\n\"It's about seeing the talent which is beyond our continental shores,\" he said. \"And I think by saying: 'Hey, go take a look', seeing is believing. We'll get plenty of teams who are open-minded by that, some that would not, but they'll be the ones who miss out. There are plenty of talented athletes here.\n\"Hayne's physical attributes don't amaze me. What amazed me is the cognitive ability for him to learn a playbook that is probably three and a half inches thick. To not be familiar with the language, the play design, the structure...to have to intellectual fortitude, to have the learning ability and the emotional recovery to play calm is what amazes me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:57:38.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
