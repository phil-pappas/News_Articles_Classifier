Editor's Picks Andrew Luck's struggles reminiscent of Tom Brady's at similar juncture \nIt's easy to forget now, but Tom Brady experienced some of the same struggles that Andrew Luck has at this stage of his career. \n\"I really think that, unless something happens, I see him being a go Sunday,\" Irsay told ESPN.com on Thursday. \"I'm not saying 100 percent for sure, but I think there's a strong likelihood he's a go. I was with him [Thursday], and he's feeling a lot better.\" \nLuck has missed the past two games because of a shoulder injury suffered against the Tennessee Titans in Week 3. Irsay confirmed a previous ESPN.com report that Luck has not been dealing with a separated right shoulder. \n\"I'm not sure where the report came from,\" Irsay said. \"It wasn't that type of injury where it was separated. It wasn't separated.\" \nMatt Hasselbeck started in Luck's place for wins against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans that pushed the Colts into a 1Â½-game lead in the AFC South. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:00:37.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
