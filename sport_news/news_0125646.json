The disdain the Hall of Fame third baseman had for all things Met wasn't just an act.\n\"It was one of those things you knew was hard, the whole (1969) season,\" Jeff said. \"My brother Ron and I were kids then, and he took it hard, so we remember it. Later in his life he talked about it. He said that was their time, they had the team.\n\"I knew it was something that always affected him. But at the end of the day, he was always proud he was a Cub.\"\nSanto hated Shea Stadium so much, he wanted to be the one to push the button and implode it. Not only did it remind him of the Mets, but his toupee once caught fire in the radio booth.\nAfter Shea was gone and replaced by Citi Field, Santo said: \"I'm just glad my hairpiece and the stadium went down together. Ugh. Just glad it's gone, that's all.\"\nSanto died in 2010 and was elected to the Hall of Fame posthumously. Jeff Santo said his father \"would love this team\" because of the camaraderie it exhibits.\n\"It's almost fitting they have to go through the Mets,\" he said. \"I couldn't imagine how he'd feel. His two goals were making the Hall and the Cubs going to the World Series. Obviously the World Series was first.\n\"I think he's watching, and I think these young guys know they're playing for the guys that never got there.\"\nThe Mets showed on their scoreboard during the first two NLCS games the black cat that crossed paths with Santo on that fateful night at Shea during the summer of 1969.\n\"It circled my dad, and my dad said it went to (manager Leo Durocher) and looked Leo right in the eye,\" Jeff said. \"It just stared at Leo and took off.\"\nThe Cubs enter Game 3 of the NLCS in a 2-0 hole, but Jeff Santo believes they still have a good shot to get to that World Series his father never got to play in. Ernie Banks is the all-time leader in games played without going to the postseason (2,528), while Santo ranks fifth (2,243), according to baseball-reference.com.\n\"I'll tell you what, man, he'll be smiling wide if they take down the Mets,\" Jeff said. \"It'd be just beautiful. We're all very emotional about the ride the Cubs are on right now because my dad would love this.\n\"We think about it every day when we watch the Cubs. He's up there somewhere with Ernie, and it feels good.\"\nPrivacy Policy Ron Santo New York Mets World Series National League Championship Series Citi Field Spring Training", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625aa8c/turbine/ct-ron-santo-jeff-santo-cubs-spt-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:22:30.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
