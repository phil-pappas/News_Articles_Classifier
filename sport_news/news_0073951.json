Game: Marietta (1-5, 0-2) at North Cobb (3-4, 2-1), 7:30 p.m.Last year: North Cobb 41, Marietta 20All-time series: Marietta leads 16-15 Prediction: North Cobb 30, Marietta 20Marietta and North Cobb will face off tonight at Emory Sewell Stadium. Both teams are recovering from losses to McEachern, though Marietta had an extra week to deal with it.The Blue Devils went back to the basics during their week off and concentrated on two things — winning the turnover battle and either converting or getting off the field on third downs.“It’s in the mindset just as much as it is physical fundamentals,” Marietta coach Scott Burton said. “We planted the seeds in the mind of (defensive) players who think about stopping the ball and forcing a turnover. Offensively, it’s about being conscious of ball security. “Whether we were successful, time will tell. Preliminary implications are that it’s more on their minds.”Marietta has a 1-5 overall record and is seeking its first Region 4 win, but the Blue Devils kept themselves in the game against McEachern and denied the Indians touchdowns once they got inside the red zone. But McEachern found a way to score points late in the game to pull away.To get an upset over North Cobb, Burton said it’s going to come down to who takes care of the football and who can create turnovers on defense.“If we can win the turnover battle and defensive battle, we have a chance,” Burton said.North Cobb has had success moving the football in its first two region wins over Harrison and Hillgrove, but the Warriors stumbled against McEachern. McEachern shut down the run with North Cobb only 34 rushing yards and 127 in the air.The Warriors will likely establish the run behind Jai Erwin and C.J. Cole, a two-headed monster that played well against Harrison and Hillgrove. They will be going up against a Marietta defense that’s surrendered 33.3 points a game. — By Adam CarringtonGame: McEachern (5-1, 2-0) at North Paulding (1-6. 1-2) 7:30 p.m. Last year: McEachern 60, North Paulding 34All-time series: McEachern leads 1-0Prediction: McEachern 35, North Paulding 10Kyle Hockman is in his eighth season as coach at McEachern, and in all those years at the helm, he hasn’t seen a better defensive team than the one he has this season.“Yes,” he said. “They’re the best we’ve had just based on a combination of personnel and intelligence. Obviously, it takes good talent and good players, but the kids have bought in and they trust our defensive coordinator (Bryan Minish). This is his second year as the solo defensive coordinator and he was our co-coordinator before that for two years. That consistency is good for the kids who have been with this program.”The Indians’ defense will be put the test in a Region 4 showdown at North Paulding tonight. The Wolfpack are averaging 24.9 points per game and scored 34 against McEachern last season. But the Indians’ defense is giving up only 7.8 points per contest this year and has already posted two shutouts.“When you dominate the line of scrimmage, it makes a difference,” Hockman said.Leading the charge defensively for McEachern has been defensive tackles Julian Rochester and Andrew Tarver. Bryan Okeh, the safety, “makes a lot of the defensive calls” and is in the box against predominately running teams. He plays back against passing teams.“He does a great job communicating with the guys,” Hockman said.Bryce Sims, at free safety, has also played a key role with four or more interceptions. Linebacker Courtney Mills, a junior, gets involved as well.“Courtney started a lot as a sophomore,” Hockman said. “He understands schemes, and Julian is a football junkie who studies lots of film. They’re veteran guys that study and love the game. They’re smart players”— By Carlton D.
