The program, \" Brain Surgery Live with Mental Floss ,\" will air at 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the National Geographic Channel.\nDeep brain stimulation surgery is used to treat people with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, a hereditary condition that also involves tremors but during movement. The National Geographic team includes Dr. Jonathan Miller, a former neurological surgery fellow at Oregon Health & Science University. Miller trained under surgeon Dr. Kim Burchiel, who studied in France with the neurologist who developed the technique, Dr. Alim Louis Benabid. Burchiel returned to Oregon where he performed the first deep brain stimulation surgery in North America at OHSU in 1991. The procedure, which involves implanting electrodes in the brain, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997.\nBurchiel discussed the procedure with The Oregonian/OregonLive. His responses have been edited for clarity.\nFirst tell me about Parkinson's and essential tremor.\nWe don't really understand much about essential tremor; we just know clinically what it is but we don't know what causes it. But in Parkinson's disease, the movement system is out of balance. Patients' movements are inhibited. They're stiff, they're slow, they have tremor. This is evidence of the system being over-inhibited.\nHow does deep brain stimulation surgery help?\nIt's not a cure but it seems to be able to rebalance that system. It works less well over time but what it effectively does is put people back into the mode of being highly functional. In a way, it's resetting the clock back a number of years to a time when their medications were actually working quite well.\nWho's a candidate for this?\nSomeone who is medically intractable meaning they have a diagnosis of Parkinson's, they've responded to the medication and they've gone along for a matter of years, maybe five, eight, 10 years to the point where the medications aren't effective or they're becoming progressively less effective or they're producing toxic effects. The toxic effects are what we're treating with deep brain stimulation. Medication is always the first step. Years after they might be a candidate for DBS.\nWhat does the procedure involve?\nIt involves two different aspects. The first stage is to put two electrodes inside the brain to help that rebalancing process. The electrodes are placed with guidance from an MRI scan to direct them to the proper targets. If the patient's awake, micro-electrode recordings are made to confirm the target. The electrodes are secured. They have two ends. One is placed in the brain and one goes under the scalp. The end of the electrode under the scalp is connected to an extension. In a second stage, that extension is placed under the skin of the neck from the head to the below the collar bone where the pacemaker is implanted.\nWhat does the pacemaker do?\nThe pacemaker is the guts of the electronics. It's a micro-computer. It stimulates the target in the brain.\nIt's sending electronic pulses?\nIt seems to block the activity of the target. It's not shutting it down but it seems to change the output. It corrects a false signal to enable better output that seems to be more normal.\nHow difficult is deep brain stimulation surgery to perform?\nWell, it's brain surgery. But we use a lot of technology to put these in. One of things you'll probably see on this program are these guidance computers to precisely target the electrodes to the proper site. I suspect they will do micro-electrode recordings to be sure they are at the target they anticipated. Those recordings have to be in an awake brain.\nThe patients are under a local anesthetic. They're perfectly comfortable. As for the surgical techniques, they're pretty straight forward. You make a small hole about the size of your little finger and pass the electrode in a safe way through the brain to the target.\nAnd that's not dangerous?\nThe chance of a complication is 1 or 2 percent. It's not high. It seems like it should be a risky procedure but it's not.\nWhat do you think viewers will learn?\nPeople are fascinated by the whole idea of brain surgery on TV. If a surgeon is willing to do this on live TV, it says a lot about the safety of the procedure. It's very predictable. This is also something that surgeons love to do because the outcome is usually very favorable and the patient likes the outcome. It restores them to a much more normal life. Everyone is happy.\nCan it be used for anything else?\nBecause of it's success other conditions have been tested with DBS – like depression. A big study concluded that that's a possibility – also epilepsy and even Alzheimer's disease. There was a trial with Alzheimer's Disease that concluded this past summer. Alzheimer's is a huge problem. We can just about diagnose it with a blood test but we have no treatment. If deep brain stimulation surgery was in any way effective to prevent or reverse Alzheimer's disease it would have a massive impact.\nMovement disorders are the vanguard of this technology but we may see other conditions starting to come under the purview of what can be helped under DBS. I'm working on using it for the treatment of obesity, which is one of our most significant health problems.\n-- Lynne Terry\nlterry@oregonian.com\n@LynnePDX", "external_links": ["http://mentalfloss.com/article/69536/were-doing-tv-show-and-it-involves-live-brain-surgery", "https://twitter.com/lynnepdx"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:53:17.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
