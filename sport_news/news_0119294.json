The defense did a great job.” \nAlabama (6-1, 3-1 SEC) intercepted four of Texas A&M’s passes and returned three for touchdowns. Tide defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick, a true freshman, took both of his takeaways back for six. Tide safety Eddie Jackson returned one of his two interceptions 93 yards for a score — the third longest return in school history. Before today, Alabama had only had one game with multiple pick-sixes (at Arkansas in 2008). \n“We were feeding off the secondary,” Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said. “They were the ones hyping everyone up in the locker room.” \nWhile it sputtered at times, Alabama’s offense did its part early on. Tide running back Derrick Henry had career-highs in rushing yards (236) and carries (32) to go with two first-half touchdowns. Henry topped his previous career-high of 148 (versus Georgia) in the first quarter against the Aggies with 153. Henry’s 236 rushing yards are the fourth most in school history. \n“He’s a workhorse; he’s tough,” Saban said. “He does a great job of instinctively running the plays the way he’s supposed to. The guy had a great game.” \nIn the past two games against Alabama, Kevin Sumlin’s offense has scored one touchdown. Quarterback Kyle Allen was 20 of 40 for 263 yards with three interceptions and one touchdown for the Aggies (5-1, 2-1). Texas A&M kicker Taylor Bertolet made three field goals from 50 yards or longer. \nAfter Allen’s second interception in the first half, he was pulled for freshman Kyler Murray. Allen would later return and throw the Aggies’ lone offensive touchdown to Ricky Seals-Jones. Seales-Jones caught six passes for 107 yards and the score. Freshman Christian Kirk had seven grabs for 90 yards. Kirk also returned a punt for a 68-yard touchdown. \n“Alabama is a great team,” Seals-Jones said. “They are physically sound. Every mistake we made, they capitalized on it. That was on us. We just weren’t clicking when we were supposed to, and they capitalized.” \nWith the offense stalling on its first drive, Alabama’s defense struck first as Fitzpatrick intercepted an overthrown pass from Allen and returned it 33 yards for a touchdown to make it 7-0. Two drives later, Henry found the end zone on a 59-yard burst up the middle for a 14-0 lead. Henry had 153 yards in the first quarter, eclipsing his career high for a game of 148. \nTexas A&M’s Taylor Bertolet drilled a 54-yard field goal with 1:14 left in the first quarter to cut the deficit to 14-3. \nHenry punished the Aggies again at the start of the second quarter, capping a five-play, 68 yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown while dragging two Texas A&M defenders into the end zone to make it 21-3. \nBertolet drilled another long kick, a 52-yarder, to bring the score to 21-6 early in the second quarter. \nThe Crimson Tide received another defensive score when safety Jackson returned an interception 93 yards to increase the lead to 28-6. \n“It was a wild half,” Saban said. \nA special teams blunder by Alabama set up a Texas A&M touchdown early in the third quarter. Senior defensive back Cyrus Jones fumbled the ball on a punt return, which led to a 3-yard touchdown pass from Allen to Seals-Jones to cut it to 28-20. \nThe Aggies’ special teams also blocked a punt in the third, but the offense stalled despite the great field position. Texas A&M ultimately missed a 52-yard field goal attempt. \nOn the ensuing drive, the Crimson Tide sustained a 6-minute possession, but could only come away with three points as kicker Adam Griffith made a 32-yard attempt to make it 31-20. \nGriffith was good on a 20-yard attempt early in the fourth quarter which pushed the score to 34-20. The Aggies added a field goal to make it 34-23 before Fitzpatrick’s second touchdown sealed it. \n“We haven’t always played pretty as a team, but we compete well in games,” Saban said. “We play with a lot of toughness.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1ROYOJl TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:07:32.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
