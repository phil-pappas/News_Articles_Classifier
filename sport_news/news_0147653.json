Dodgers continue their dominance over San Diego Privacy Policy | More Newsletters Getty Images LOS ANGELES, CA - OCTOBER 02: Cory Spangenberg #15 of the San Diego Padres makes a throwing error to Jedd Gyorko #9 allowing a run to score and Adrian Gonzalez #23 of the Los Angeles Dodgers to third base during the third inning at Dodger Stadium on October 2, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images) The Padres started the 2015 season at Dodger Stadium with hope, hype and high expectations. They're finishing the 2015 season at Dodger Stadium with agony, anguish and angst. Somewhere in between ... the truth lies. The Dodgers won 6-2 in the first game of their season-ending 3-game series against the Padres. Well, season-ending for San Diego. Los Angeles is going to the playoffs for the third straight year. San Diego will finish with a losing record for the fifth straight year. Padres starter Casey Kelly had a rough 3rd inning. After Adrian Gonzalez singled home a run to put the Dodgers up 1-0, Kelly got Justin Turner to hit a check-swing grounder to Cory Spangenberg at second base. The rookie tried a backhand flip to start a double play but the ball got away from him and floated in to left field. The error let one run score and Kelly couldn't overcome it. The Dodgers scored five times in the inning and, given the fact the Padres have failed to score five runs in a game in more than a week, the game was pretty much already over. Padres 1st baseman Cody Decker, who has become a fan favorite, drove in his first Big League run with a sacrifice fly in the 7th inning. The Dodgers are 5-12 against the Padres this year. L.A. has won every series they've played and with Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw going the next two games it's a good bet that trend will not change over the weekend.
