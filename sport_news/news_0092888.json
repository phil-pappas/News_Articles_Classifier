He not only leads the Big Ten in yards-per-kick with a 46.3 average (seventh nationally), but with the help of his coverage unit has been uncanny at downing the ball inside the 20. \nOf his 33 punts, 14 have died inside the 20 and 14 have traveled over 50 yards, with only five touchbacks. So he's often getting good distance and hang time or figuratively tying a noose around the opposing offense by pinning it deep in its own territory. \nBut that's not good enough for him. \n\"I think I have a lot to improve on,\" Johnston said. \"The pooch kick (usually bounced along the ground to prevent a return or from traveling into the end zone for a touchback) has been good, but we could place it a little better directionally.\" \nCoach Urban Meyer doesn't seem to have any problem with the way Johnston is performing. This week he affectionately called him \"the Australian,\" as in \"You know who he is.\" As in, no name needed. \n\"He's really, really good at his job,\" said Meyer, debating on whether to toss in a third \"really.\" \nOhio State punter Cameron Johnston and coach Urban Meyer work out some details before the 2014 College Football Playoff title game in Arlington, Texas. (Photo: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports) \nBy now, most Ohio State football fans know Johnston's story. The 22-year-old former Australian Rules Football Player sent out audition tapes to American universities, one of which reached OSU special teams coach Kerry Coombs. It so happened the Buckeyes had a hole to fill at punter heading into the 2013 season, so they signed Johnston to a national letter of intent. \nEven though he had not played football before his arrival in the U.S., Johnston was an immediate success. Coming into this season he boasted the third-best career punting average in school history (44.5 yards). In his first two seasons, he ranked among the national leaders in percentage of punts downed inside the 20 — first in 2013 and second in 2014 — and, unofficially, inside the 10, where he was also first and second, respectively. \nThe Buckeyes have a shot at a third straight top 5 finish in net punting. They are first in the Big Ten and seventh nationally (42.2 yards) and have allowed only 35 return yards on Johnston's 33 kicks (1.1), a figure nearly as abysmal for return specialists as Blutarsky's 0.0 GPA in Animal House. \n\"(Meyer) tells me where he wants me to put the ball, and I just want to make him happy. I hope he is,\" Johnston said. \"It's good to give (coverage) guys like (wide receiver) Jeff Greene and Bryce (Haynes, long-snapper) a chance to get downfield and down the ball. I feel like if I can put it out there, they'll get down there ... they always do.\" \nJohnston was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in the 38-12 win over Western Michigan. He repeatedly put the Broncos in a tough position, averaging 51.5 yards on four punts, with three of them landing inside the 20 and two of them inside the 10 at the 8 and 1. The other was downed at the 13. The Buckeyes gave up zero punt return yards that day, disarming return specialist Darius Phillips, who had a field day against Michigan State, including a 100-yard kickoff return. \nJohnston's best performance of the season might have come with the Buckeyes clad in black last Saturday night in the Shoe against Penn State. With quarterback Cardale Jones firing blanks out of the gate, Ohio State was lucky to be down only 3-0 after one period. Lucky, that is, to have Johnston. \nHis first punt carried 56 yards, leaving DeAndre Thompkins, one of the Big Ten's top return men, no choice but to fair catch it at the PSU 23. Johnston's second punt was a 45-yarder, again fair caught by Thompkins, this time at the 8. And Johnston's third punt of the first quarter was a perfectly-stroked 32-yarder that was downed at the 2. \nThe offense came alive behind J.T. Barrett in the second quarter and Johnston wasn't summoned again until the third quarter when the Buckeyes again struggled with Jones behind center. Johnston bailed out the offense both times with a punt fair caught by Thompkins at the 8 and another downed at the 4. The Lions did nothing with those possessions and never got closer than 21-10 as the Buckeyes pulled away to a 38-10 victory. \n\"It was a great atmosphere out there; I didn't realize how crazy it was,\" Johnston said. \"It's amazing to come from Australia and be in this kind of atmosphere. The build-up all week (to the Penn State game) was amazing. This team is a lot of fun to be around.\" \nJohnston was taken aback when asked, tongue in cheek, if he's the best player on the team. \n\"Definitely not!\" he said, laughing. \nThere's no denying, though, the impact he's made. \nJohnston is part of a growing trend toward Australian kickers and punters in college football, thanks in part to specific skills they honed playing Australia's national game. Johnston, like Penn State punter Daniel Pasquariello, is a product of ProKick Australia, a Melbourne-based training ground for punters and kickers. \nProKick has produced the last two recipients of the Ray Guy Award, which goes to college football's best punter — Tom Horncey of Memphis in 2013 and Tom Hackett of Utah in 2014. Good omen for Johnston? \n\"I didn't really know a lot about college football,\" Johnston said, \"but Nathan Chapman and John Smith (ProKick instructors) told me how to punt and taught me about the atmosphere when I got here.\" \nOne of Johnston's fellow ProKick trainees is Michigan punter Blake O'Neill, whose fumbled snap on the final play last Saturday resulted in a Michigan State touchdown return and stunning 27-23 victory over the Wolverines. Long forgotten in that crazy ending was the 80-yard punt O'Neill boomed inside the 1 in the first quarter. \n\"(O'Neill) was just trying to make a play; it's unfortunate,\" Johnston said. \"He'll get it right. He's had a real good season.\" \nJust not as good as Johnston, who seems like a cinch to eventually play on Sundays. His 71 career punts inside the 20 has him closing in on the OSU record (78), set over four years by A.J. Trapasso (2005-08). \n\"(The NFL is) a goal down the tracks if everything works out,\" Johnston said. \"The big thing for me is to just keep learning, day to day. I came in to learn as much as I can and I keep learning and help when I can. \n\"It's been a long journey and it's amazing to be in this situation.\" \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:59:28.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
