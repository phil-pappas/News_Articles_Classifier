The same may be true of that NFL feeder league known as the Southeastern Conference West. \nMaybe after noticing that LSU tailback Leonard Fournette has had rushing attempts of 28, 26, 26 and – most recently – a career-high 31 this season and leads the nation in rushing with 1,202 yards and 200.3 yards a game, Alabama coach Nick Saban has seen the light as far as tailback Derrick Henry is concerned. \nThe strange thing about Alabama’s 35-28 loss to Ohio State in the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs last season in the Superdome was the fact that Henry touched the ball just 13 times in that game, which Alabama led comfortably early and was within striking distance until the end. He gained 95 yards for an average of 7.3 yards a carry. \nThe Saban of old, who liked to ride LaBrandon Toefield, Justin Vincent, Joseph Addai and Alley Broussard while at LSU, would have kept going to Henry, a towering 6-foot-3 for his position and 242 pounds. But Saban may have adjusted his personality a little too strongly last season to all the passing games sweeping the nation and perhaps listened too much to offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin because he let quarterback Blake Sims throw too much, considering how Ohio State couldn’t stop Henry in a close game. Now Sims was among the nation’s leaders in passing efficiency throughout last season, but against Ohio State he threw three interceptions amid 36 attempts with the last pick deep in Buckeye territory that lost the game. \nAnd Henry was right there, gaining 39 yards on six carries in the second half. New Alabama quarterback Jake Coker threw two interceptions amid 45 attempts in Alabama’s 43-37 loss to Ole Miss and another two amid 33 attempts in a 27-14 win over Arkansas three weeks later. \nIn a 41-23 win over Texas A&M last week, Coker had closer-to-Brandon Harris-like numbers as he threw just 25 times, completing 19 for 138 yards with zero interceptions while Henry carried a more-Leonard Fournette-like 32 times for 236 yards with two touchdowns. His 32 rushes was a career high and 19 more than he had in the season opening win against Wisconsin. In one game, Henry jumped from fifth in the SEC in rushing to second behind Fournette, who had a career high 31 rushes for 180 yards in a 35-28 win over Florida Saturday. Henry is seventh in the nation in rushing with 901 yards. \nCould Saban be copying LSU coach Les Miles’ philosophy for the better? \n“We’ve always known that Derrick’s a workhorse that kind of gets better as the game goes on in a lot of cases,” Saban said, borrowing one of Miles’ stock quotes on Fournette, on the SEC teleconference Wednesday. “He certainly hasn’t disappointed us.” \nThe LSU-Alabama game, which will also not disappoint on Nov. 7, has not been only Miles vs. Saban for a few years now. This year the SEC West Super Bowl on in Tuscaloosa is looking like a Fournette-Henry main event with Harris and Coker on the undercard and Les and Nick serving the drinks and moving the talent. \nSEC SATURDAY TV: Auburn (4-2, 1-2 SEC) at Arkansas (2-4, 1-2), 11 a.m., SEC Network; Tennessee (3-3, 1-2) at No. 8 Alabama (6-1, 3-1), 2:30 p.m., CBS; Missouri (4-3, 1-3) at Vanderbilt (2-4, 0-3); No. 15 Texas A&M (5-1, 2-1) at No. 24 Ole Miss (5-2, 2-1), 6 p.m., ESPN; Western Kentucky (6-1, 4-0 CUSA) at No. 5 LSU (6-0, 4-0), 6 p.m., ESPNU; Kentucky (4-2, 2-2) at Mississippi State (5-2, 1-2), 6:30 p.m., SEC Network. \nHELP WANTED AT FLORIDA: Florida kicker Jorge Powell left the LSU game Saturday with a leg injury after kicking the team’s first extra point for a 7-0 lead. Former starting kicker Austin Hardin kicked the Gators’ next three conversions in a 35-28 loss, but Coach Jim McElwain wants more than Hardin, who has struggled at times. So this week, McElwain held open tryouts for kickers. \n“I think the final count was 216, which was really good,” he said. “We’re still working through it right now. There are obviously a lot of things NCAA wise. By the end of the week, we hope to have some candidates that can come out and help us.” \nThe Gators are open for open tryouts this week as their next game is a week from Saturday against Georgia in Jacksonville, Florida. \nGUILBEAU POLL: 1. LSU (6-0, 4-0 SEC). 2. Florida (6-1, 4-1). 3. Alabama (6-1, 3-1). 4. Texas A&M (5-1, 2-1). 5. Mississippi State (5-2, 1-2). 6. Tennessee (3-3, 1-2) 7. Georgia (5-2, 3-2). 8. Missouri (4-3, 1-3). 9. Ole Miss (5-2, 2-1). 10. Auburn (4-2, 1-2). 11. Kentucky (4-2, 2-2). 12. Arkansas (2-4, 1-2) 13. South Carolina (3-4, 1-4). 14. Vanderbilt (2-4, 0-3). \nSTAT OF THE WEEK: There are only two quarterbacks listed in the SEC’s top 10 passing leaders in average yards per game and in passing efficiency who have not thrown an interception on the season. And both are from the Shreveport area – LSU’s Brandon Harris of Bossier City and Mississippi State’s Dak Prescott of Haughton. \nQUOTE OF THE WEEK: “Well, I don’t really talk to anybody during the season but our staff in trying to get our team ready. So, I don’t have much time for talking to friends between recruiting and trying to get our team ready. That’s full metal jacket for me. I think most of my friends understand.” \n---Alabama coach Nick Saban. 7 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/2015/10/21/next-lsu-bama-game-century-looking-like-tailback-tango/74331176/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:14:37.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
