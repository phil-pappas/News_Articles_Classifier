It burnished the \"Legend of the Mad Hatter\" for LSU coach Les Miles' incomprehensible gambles.\nAnd it made a hero out of Domingue, a 6-feet-2, 170-pound junior walk-on, in the unlikeliest way.\nLSU PK Trent Domingue recalls his fake field goal TD | Video LSU placekicker Trent Domingue talks to the media Monday.\n\"It's always been in the back of my mind,\" Domingue said. \"I never really thought it would ever happen. It's a thing a kicker always dreams about and what we would do in celebration. When I scored I forgot everything to do. I just ran.\"\nEven though LSU eschewed the 33-yard field goal, Domingue still had to make a kick seconds after the excitement of putting his team ahead. He admitted to blacking out and not remembering the entire touchdown run\n\"It was the hardest extra point I ever kicked,\" Domingue said. \"All the adrenaline and the distance I ran.\"\nDomingue said he enjoyed the aftermath while at the same time knowing he's got to crawl out from under it and be ready to kick when LSU takes on Western Kentucky Saturday.\nCalls and texts overloaded his phones. His father and girlfriend were \"in the stands freaking out.\" His mother and brother listened on the radio.\n\"They all had the same reaction,\" he said.\n\"Yesterday was fun, this weekend was fun, I had the recognition,\" he said. \"But I've got to get back to focusing on my job in kicking, Western Kentucky, and have an LSU style week at practice.\"\nThat's after a Les Miles-style victory. Miles has used his kickers to run the ball on fake field goals before, if they are athletic enough. Colt David took and over-the-shoulder flip for a TD from holder Matt Flynn for a TD vs. South Carolina in 2007. In 2010 at Florida, Josh Jasper did the same, catching it on one hop from holder Derek Helton for a key first down, which led to the game-winning touchdown.\nDomingue kicked for only two years of high school at St. Paul's in Covington. He played a lot of soccer but was also fast enough for the track team, where he competed in the log and triple jumps.\nThe fake has always been in LSU's playbook. The tigers had been putting in extra time on it in the last two weeks so Domingue and Kragthorpe could feel it coming.\n\"Anytime that you have players that are so confident in the play that they basically (say) 'it's just the right time, coach.'\" Miles said Monday. \"I had six people calling that before it ever came to my mouth.\"\nDomingue was one of them. He said he mentioned it. Kragthorpe said he thought it might be coming.\n\"We had it in our arsenal for a couple of weeks now,\" said Kragthorpe, a senior walk-on quarterback. \"We practiced it a lot this week. We thought we would have a chance to take advantage of something they do and we were able to do that.\"\nKragthorpe said he and Domingue practiced the play \"probably 20 times\" last week, staying after practices to get the throw just right. They knew going onto the field he fake was the call but Kragthopre said he had the authority to check out of the play in case Florida didn't show the right defense.\nDomingue was thinking fake even before he went to the field.\n\"I kind of brought it up to coach Miles and I think he was thinking about it, too,\" Domingue said. \"Him and Peev (special teams coach Bradley Dale Peveto) had a little word for about 5 seconds and they gave us the go-ahead.\"\nThe play is called \"Lion\" since it is run to the left side. If run to the right with the holder flipping the ball over his head, it's called \"Tiger\". It was the same play LSU tried unsuccessfully against Alabama in 2012.\nDomingue stayed cool on the outside. Inside, he was roiling.\n\"Disbelief; anxiety,\" he said of his feelings. \"Fortunately I didn't have too much time to think about it. Fortunately they gave us the call and we ran out there. Definitely some nerves. I remember thinking we're actually going to run it.\"\nThe ball was spotted on the right hash mark, leaving the wide side of the field to the left. Florida rushed three players from that side, including All-American cornerback Vernon Hargreaves. Darrel Williams was the blocker on the end 1 yard off the line, and Colin Jeter was to his right.\nAt the snap, Williams and Jeter feigned a block and headed downfield, angling left. Kragthorpe spotted the ball then lifted it and threw a perfect strike to Domingue who bobbled it twice but easily turned the corner with Hargreaves in hot pursuit. Williams and Jeter double-teamed the first man over, Jarrard Davis, which allowed Domingue to score and saved the play. Williams hit him first and Jeter one more time just in case. Domingue needed to score or make at least 13 yards to keep the drive alive.\nDomingue cruised into the end zone and the celebration began. He clutched the ball tightly with both arms as if worried about another bobble as teammates went to congratulate him. Offensive lineman Garrett Brumfield accidentally knocked down field judge Bobby Ables in the melee.\n\"I remember pieces of it, I remember thinking 'do not drop this ball',\" Domingue said. \"In practice it was all clean catches. I guess it was just nerves. Fortunately it worked out the way it did.\n\"I liked the (picture of Gators') mascot in the background with his arms folded. I thought that was pretty ironic. It looked like he was just pouting (saying) 'C'mon.'\"\nThe stadium erupted. Kragthorpe felt vindicated, although he didn't get credit for a touchdown pass since the ball was thrown backward as a lateral.\nHe recalled LSU's 31-28 Music City Bowl loss, the last time LSU ran a fake field goal. That time it was an option run with Kragthorpe keeping the ball, and he was ruled down just short of the goal line on the first half's final play. Replays appeared to show he crossed -- Kragthorpe and Miles insist he did -- but the replay official would not overturn the call.\nKragthorpe said the play is supposed to be a lateral, not a pass, and that he was thinking he might have to make a tackle if Domingue dropped the ball. He caught some flak from his friends the next day.\n\"They said, 'You've come this close to accounting for a touchdown twice, so. . . .',\" he said, trailing off. \"It was awesome; a cool experience.\n\"I'm glad we got this one in. Obviously I thought we scored in the bowl game. They didn't see it that way. Just being able to have an effect on the outcome of the game is a huge play. Trent made a huge play.\"\nJasper, who graduated at the 2010 season, was on the sidelines at kickoff but went home to watch the remainder of the game on television. He thought back to catching his lateral on a perfect bounce, which had to survive a replay challenge that it was a forward pass and therefore incomplete.\n\"As they were lining up I was thinking this would be a perfect time to do something if they were going to do it,\" said Jasper, who lives in Baton Rouge. \"Lo and behold, they did.\n\"I was pumped. I thought it was great. I was excited for him, a perfect play call. Once he got the ball under control, he turned on the jets. They executed a little better than we did.\"\nThat Domingue was in position to make the play is more remarkable since he won the placekicking job in the off season from Colby Delahoussaye, who held the job most of the past two seasons. Domingue is also the team's backup punter.\nDelahoussaye, also a walk-on, made 24 of 29 in his career with streaks of nine and 13 in a row. Last year's Florida game was the high point of his career as he nailed a career-long 50-yarder with three seconds left to win the game, 30-27. He was unable to overcome a late season slump last year and Domingue got the call in the Music City Bowl for his first career attempt, which was low and easily blocked.\nThis season Domingue is seven-for-seven on field goals with a long kick of 45 yards.\nTeammates went out of their way to applaud the play, especially Leonard Fournette and Brandon Harris, who usually carry the workload. Fournette had 180 yards rushing and two touchdowns and Harris passed for 202 yards and two scores.\n\"It's going to be all crazy at practice,\" LSU running back Leonard Fournette laughed afterward. \"He might think he's better than all the running backs. He did a great job. Coach Miles mad an excellent call that surprised everybody.\"\nSaid LSU quarterback Brandon Harris: \"When I seen him bobbled it, my heart dropped. He made a great catch and Brad threw him a great ball. It was set up so perfectly.\"\nDomingue has no real illusions, simply one of the great memories of LSU football that fans will share in for years, as they have with David and Jasper. His 16-yard run made him the team's second leading rusher in the game.\n\"It's a dream to have the opportunity to even run the ball,\" Domingue said. \"It's so cool.\"", "external_links": ["http://player.espn.com/player.js?pcode=1kNG061cgaoolOncv54OAO1ceO-I&width=576&height=324&externalId=espn:13912910"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:42:47.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
