At Roland Garros, I think she (Safarova) played an amazing match. I think today, I wanted so much to win. I was fighting and I was really concentrating.\" \nMuguruza, a Wimbledon singles finalist in 2015, had come into Monday's match on a high having risen to world number three by overtaking no less than Maria Sharapova. \nSafarova, on the other hand, was yet to win a match since the US Open - having battled illness and an abdominal injury - as Muguruza came out the stronger on court in Singapore, taking the first set 6-3 and hitting four aces on the way. \nSafarova had somehow managed to save seven break points, but the two that mattered were lost to Muguruza, the difference in return percentage showing as the first set was wrapped up in around 50 minutes. \nDesperate to impress, Safarova broke the Spaniard's serve in the second set opener and was growing in confidence, only for Muguruza to come back level at 3-3 with a break of her own, which was sealed thanks to a good baseline-call challenge from the Spaniard. \nMuguruza was threatening to run away with it, but Safarova did well to keep pace and force a tie-break. \nHowever, Muguruza had found the extra pace in her shots and kept her nose in front all the way to a 7/4 scoreline, with Safarova's errant forehand into the net ending proceedings.
