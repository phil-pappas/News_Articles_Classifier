Smith took the night off, the second game of a back-to-back, as the the Cavs struggled to find any consistent offense beyond repeatedly getting to the free throw line.\nHere are five observations from the loss:\nAnderson Varejao's recovery going well – It was media day when Varejao revealed that he was \"full go\" for the start of training camp. While other players have gotten rest during this preseason or nursed injuries, Varejao has suited up in all four preseason games, something that has been surprising to head coach David Blatt.\n\"Honestly yes,\" Blatt said Tuesday night following the Cavs' fourth straight preseason loss. \"I think Andy worked very hard rehabilitating and he's been focused and determined to come back this year and come back in a good way. If you look at that particular injury, the Achilles injury, a small percentage of the players that go through it at the age of 30 and above actually come back to the same level they were at before. He's doing everything to prove he's one of those guys that can do that and more. I've been pleasantly surprised with his status as of today and also his performance. I think he's been playing really well.\"\nVarejao played 12 minutes against the Bucks, scoring two points and grabbing three rebounds. He also added an assist, a block and a steal.\nThrough four preseason games, Varejao is averaging 6.5 points while playing 13.5 minutes. He has shown no ill affects from the injury, displaying his usual hustle and pesky fight on the boards.\nThe crowded frontcourt was expected to keep Varejao from having a clearly defined role. But Kevin Love's preseason debut has been pushed back, Mozgov doesn't appear fully recovered from off-season knee surgery and Tristan Thompson's holdout doesn't like like it will end any time. That means Varrejao will likely serve as one of the important pieces of the second unit provided he continues to show progress in his recovery from the season-ending injury suffered in December.\nWhistles aplenty – The most memorable number during Tuesday's game against Milwaukee was 70, the amount of free throws the teams shot combined.\n\"It was probably ugly for y'all,\" Cavs point guard Mo Williams said. \"But it felt pretty good for us. Every game takes on its own identity and this was no different. Have to go out and play the game.\"\nGames usually aren't pretty against the defensive-minded Bucks, a team that chose to play many of its starters. Their long and aggressive defense usually leads to turnovers or whistles, depending on how the game is being officiated, and Tuesday it was the latter.\nThe Cavs went 35-of-44 from the striple while the Bucks shot 21-of-26. Attacking the Milwaukee defense was part of the Cavs' plan.\n\"It showed as we were in the bonus early and often,\" Williams said. \"That was a point of emphasis. I thought we did a good job of getting to the line. Even I shot free throws and I don't really get to the line that much.\"\nWilliams finished with a team-high 18 points, with seven of those points coming from the foul line. Richard Jefferson, the next leading scorer added 16 points, with 11 of his coming from the stripe.\n\"I thought we flowed beautifully in the first half ourselves but fouling too much,\" Blatt said about what can be taken from such a sloppy game. \"Have to play great defense without fouling.\"\nHitting goals – Going into every preseason game, there are certain things a team is hoping to accomplish.\n\"The most important thing was getting out there and getting in rhythm,\" Williams said. \"Getting geared up for Oct. 27. That's the most important thing.\"\nThe other goal is to leave each preseason game healthy, something that every player has talked about at one point or another during training camp. They accomplished that goal again Tuesday.\nWilliams laid out the others, including making progress after Monday's lethargic clunker.\n\"One, get to the free throw line and I thought we did that,\" he said. \"Two, push the ball. Obviously just defensively I thought we did a great job of communicating. Those first three quarters we came out and did those things. I think you can see in transition how we pushed the ball. You can do those things when you get stops. I thought we did a great job of that. We didn't make a lot of shots today and they're long and outrebounded us but it wasn't by much. We thought we did a good job of hitting those goals. We did a good job of competing. We didn't think we had great effort last night and I think we exceeded that tonight with how we played.\"\nPreseason tweaks - There has been plenty of chatter about the length and set-up of the preseason. The Cavs are getting a taste of the challengeing schedule this year. They have played two separate back-to-backs already, with one more to come.\nThe cluster of games has led to sloppy performances and players being held out as a precaution. Blatt said Monday that he wouldn't sacrifice health for a better preseason product and that's the right decision.\n\"I've expressed myself to the people that make those decisions on more than one occasion,\" Blatt said. \"My voice is only one but it's my opinion that we should play four or maximum five preseason games and create a situation where we would have fewer back-to-backs so players have a little more time to rest and a little less wear and tear during the preseason. I think that would be good for the game and I know it would be good for the players. I also think it would be good for the fans.\"\nJames had pegged Tuesday night as a rest day and then he arrived to the arena feeling sick before being sent home. Mozgov was also held out after playing 27 minutes the night before against the powerful Memphis frontcourt. Kyrie Irving has yet to participate in practice so he was also absent along with Iman Shumpert, Kevin Love and J.R. Smith. Even Milwaukee didn't see a need to play youngster Giannis Antetokounmpo\nThose absences created opportunities for other players, including camp invites Jared Cunningham, Chris Johnson, Dionte Christmas and Quin Cook -- all receiving double-digit minutes. The one open roster spot, which could be two depending on what happens with Thompson, will likely be decided in the preseason. In that sense, the seven games has value, especially for the those players fighting to make the team.\n\"You really get a feel for it in the games,\" Blatt said. \"Can they get on the floor and help you because they're all going to practice hard. Can they get out in an NBA game and play?\"\nCunningham, who seems to have the inside track on the last roster spot, struggled on Tuesday. He played 23 minutes, hitting 1-of-12 from the field and scoring six points.\nJ.R. Smith update – Monday night while sidelined with a hamstring injury, Smith spent part of the game grabbing some cotton candy from a vendor and snacking while on the bench. There weren't any cravings Tuesday, but he still didn't get the green light to return to the lineup.\n\"Hamstring is a tricky thing,\" Blatt said prior to the game. \"There's a protocol for different levels of hamstring damage. It's really more of a day-to-day thing. I think seven days being a fair estimate as to when he will return to live play. We are still on the cautious side of things and waiting.\"\nSmith will spend tomorrow getting treatment, but his status for Thursday's game against Indiana is still undecided. He has played in just one preseason game, scoring 15 points on 6-of-10 shooting against Atlanta.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:12:16.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
