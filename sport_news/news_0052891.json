The scent is more tolerable. \nThe Ravens were in danger of falling to 0-4 before rallying past the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime last Thursday. \n“It was good to get that stink off us,” running back Justin Forsett said. \nThe Cleveland Browns are also 1-3, so the loser Sunday faces a tough road ahead. Since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970, 206 teams have started 1-4. Only 10, a scant 5 percent, rallied to reach the postseason, according to STATS. \n“We’re not in the clear by any means,” Forsett said. “They’re all must-win for us.” \nThe Ravens have reached the playoffs in six of the last seven years. The Browns haven’t qualified for the postseason since 2002. This year, though, both teams are currently on even ground. \nHow they got there is pretty similar. Baltimore’s three losses have come by a total of 14 points, and the Browns have dropped two straight by a combined 10 points. \n“Both teams have played well for periods of time, but not well enough to finish games and win,” Cleveland coach Mike Pettine said. “The Ravens very easily could be 3-1 or 4-0, and we could point to a handful of plays in our games and make the same argument.” \nThe Ravens, who have their roots in Cleveland, have won 13 of the last 14 against the Browns and are 24-8 in this, er, rivalry. \n“It’s hard for me to call it a rivalry sitting in this seat because it’s been so one-sided,” Pettine said. “It’s our goal to get that changed.” \nSome things to know about this AFC North matchup: \nSTARTED AT THE BOTTOM: Despite their efforts to improve the NFL’s worst rushing defense from last season, the Browns are ranked 31st, allowing 141.5 yards per game. \nBeyond that, the Browns are giving up chunk yardage and have been burned by long plays - on the ground and in the air. \n“Man, we just got to make plays,” cornerback Joe Haden said. “You don’t really see teams slowly marching. We got to make sure that we stay tight or it’ll be somebody running through our defense uncovered.” \nTO GLORY: Forsett broke loose for 150 yards rushing against Pittsburgh after being limited to 13 yards on 10 carries on Sept. 27 against Cincinnati.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:50:54.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
