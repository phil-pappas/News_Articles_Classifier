The Chief Minister was addressing on the occasion of Police Commemoration Dday at the Armed Police Complex in Zewan near here. The Chief Minister and other leaders and police officers laid floral wreaths on the martyrs’ memorial. On the occasion, 39 police personnel, including 24 J&K policemen, 7 BSF men and 8 CRPF men, were also remembered. A special mention was also made of SI Mohammad Altaf, who lost his life in fighting militants in the Bandipore area of north Kashmir on October 7. Mufti said the J&K Police had fully responded to the situation over the past two and a half decades and shown a high degree of patience to face any situation. He said apart from law and order duties, the police also helped in preventing crimes, mainly drug addiction, among youth. He said from September 1, 2014, to August 31, 2015 — 437 police personnel lost their lives in the country. Since the eruption of militancy, 966 policemen, 486 SPOs and 131 VDCs lost their lives in the state, Mufti said. “We must salute these personnel,” Mufti said, adding that a number of schemes were launched to help the kith and kin of those who lost their lives during their duties.
