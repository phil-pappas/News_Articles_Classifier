(AP) - The Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife is sponsoring this year's turtle nesting beach work day that will begin at the North Hero State Park and then move on to other beaches.\nThe volunteers will work to improve the nesting beaches for the state's threatened spiny softshell turtles and other turtle species.\nThis year's event begins Saturday in North Hero at 10 a.m. Once work has been completed there it will move to other locations.\nSpiny softshell turtles only nest on a few beaches on the northern portions of Lake Champlain. Skunks, raccoons and other small predators can raid the nests and eat the eggs.\nLast year 100 people participated in the cleanup, including many families with children.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
