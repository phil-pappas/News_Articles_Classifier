(Roosevelt Collection opened with empty storefronts that are only now getting occupied with restaurants, including the steakhouse Chop , from the owners of Porkchop.)\nWe've previously told you about the food occupants at NewCity â€” LYFE Kitchen , Yard House , Earls Kitchen + Bar , Mariano's (not to mention the many dining options within walking distance, such as Strings Ramen, Dinosaur Bar-B-Q etc.). Most of these occupants are now open, but next week will be the grand opening, and a few restaurants will offer free food.\nAdobe Gila's: This Mexican/Tex-Mex chain is a trip to South Padre Island, with overflowing neon margaritas and fajitas aplenty. From Oct. 30 through Nov. 1, chips and salsas will be free. On Oct. 31, kids meals come free with every adult entree order.\nNando's Peri-Peri: The South African chicken chain has made an aggressive inroad to the Chicago market this year, opening three locations on the North Side. The NewCity store will offer one free of either a quarter-piece chicken, chicken sandwich, wrap or pita, between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m Oct. 31.\nkpang@tribpub.com\nTwitter @pang\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/pang", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.chopchicago.com/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a6547/turbine/ct-newcity-grand-opening-lincoln-park-free-food-deals-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:09:14.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
