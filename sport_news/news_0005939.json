Photo: Getty Images\nJarryd Hayne might not enjoy much game time, or could be left out of the squad altogether when the San Francisco 49ers play the undefeated Arizona Cardinals this weekend.\nOne of Hayne's rivals for the 49ers' punt return job, Bruce Ellington, is expected to suit up for Sunday's game (early Monday AEST) after an ankle injury kept him out of last week's 43-18 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThe punt returner the 49ers went to instead of Hayne in the second half of the Steelers' game, rookie DeAndrew White, received praise on Wednesday from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey.\n\"DeAndrew deserved it, to be honest with you,\" McGaughey, explaining why White took Hayne's punt return job, told reporters.\nAdvertisement \"DeAndrew led our team in punt returns in the pre-season.\n\"He had over 20 yards per return.\"\nWhile Hayne had just one return for seven yards against the Steelers, White also didn't impress with his one return for four yards.\n\"I've had these conversations with DeAndrew,\" McGaughey said.\n\"He has to take advantage of the opportunities when he gets them and be more decisive as a returner.\"\nThe 49ers will be underdogs when they travel to Phoenix to play the Arizona Cardinals, with Hayne possibly not being named in the 46-man game-day squad.\nThe team will not say what players will be left out of the 46 until 90 minutes before kick-off, but with back-up running back Mike Davis and White earning more game time than Hayne against the Steelers, Ellington back from injury and running back Reggie Bush (calf) possibly fit again, the Australian rookie could be squeezed out.\nDavis and White were both left out of the 46-man squad for the 49ers' game-one victory against the Minnesota Vikings.\nHead coach Jim Tomsula said Bush is still working through a calf strain that kept him out of the Steelers game but is on the practice field feeling \"really good\".\nTop running back option Carlos Hyde, who suffered a thigh bruise against the Steelers, is also expected to be fit for the Cardinals, adding pressure on who to leave out of the 46.\nTomsula said he would have a rotation of running backs.\n\"You need a stable of guys,\" Tomsula said.\nMcGaughey said he would \"make do with whoever we have out there\" for punt and kick returns, but added rookies Hayne and White have plenty to learn.\n\"With these young players, there's a maturation process they have to go through,\" McGaughey said.\n\"They have to touch that hot stove and bump their head on the concrete sometimes and realise it is hard.\"\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:42:16.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
