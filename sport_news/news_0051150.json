Sianis and his goat were seated, then people started to complain that the goat stinks. Asked by management to leave, Sianis then threw his arms in the air and put a curse on the team. ‘The Cubs ain’t gonna win no more! The Cubs will never win a World Series so long as the goat is not allowed in Wrigley Field.’”\n“Have the Cubs won the World Series since 1945?”\n“1945? The last time the Cubs won the World Series was in 1908, 37 years BEFORE the Sianis Curse. The Cubs had a few chances over the years, but something always seems to go wrong. With the Cubs down 0-2 to the Mets, hopefully... THE CURSE LIVES!”\nMighty was waiting on the Giants (+5) on Monday and likes the Mets on Tuesday.
