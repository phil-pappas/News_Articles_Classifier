(KTTC) - \nThe Rochester Police Benevolent Association Country Show came to rock the Mayo Civic Center Presentation Hall Sunday evening. The headline act may be a very familiar face to people who watch TV singing competitions. \nCraig Wayne Boyd, winner of season 7 of NBC's \"The Voice,\" was the marquee act. Boyd had a No. 1 country song earlier this year with the song \"My Baby's Got A Smile On Her Face.\" \nBoyd said his life after \"The Voice\" has been a whirlwind, but that he is grateful to still get to perform on stage every night. \n\"That's where I'm myself,\" said Boyd. \"Everywhere else I'm kind of shy and backwards but when I get on stage I'm able to be myself. It's fun.\" \nThe opening act for the concert was the Van Lears.
