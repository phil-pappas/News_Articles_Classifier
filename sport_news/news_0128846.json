Marseille's last win came in September — a 3-0 victory at Groningen in the Europa League. \nSince taking over from Marcelo Bielsa this summer, Marseille coach Michel has failed to find the winning formula, with the club sitting in 16th place with nine points from 10 games. \n\"We are in an emergency situation,\" said Cameroon defender Nicolas Nkoulou. \"We needed the three points, obviously we are disappointed.\" \nJust two points above Marseille, 14th-place Bordeaux was held 0-0 at home by struggling Montpellier in a match lacking chances for both sides. Rennes hosted Nice in a late match. \nWith a partial closure at the Velodrome because of fan trouble last month, the hosts' first chance came after eight minutes when Batshuayi's curled effort forced keeper Benjamin Lecomte to parry the ball on to the cross bar. The ball rebounded into Romain Alessandrini's path and the midfielder fired into the back of the net but his goal was disallowed because he was in an offside position. \nMarseille enjoyed most of the possession and entertained its reduced fanbase with a series of skillful moves down the left flank before Lucas Ocampos unintentionally drew a penalty. The Marseille forward sloppily gave the ball away, only for defender Francois Bellugou to handle it in the box. Batshuayi sent Lecomte the wrong way to convert from the spot. \nUnable to break down the Marseille defense, eighth-place Lorient relied on aimless long-range shots although Moukandjo came close with a 20-meter strike that ended inches wide at the half-hour mark. \nMoukandjo made no mistake seven minutes later against the run of the play, taking advantage of a superb lofted ball from Bellugou to beat Steve Mandanda from close range after shaking off defender Nicolas Nkoulou. \nMarseille exposed itself to counterattacks in the second half while Batshuayi was repeatedly caught offside. Marseille could even have conceded again had it not been for Mandanda's decisive save in the 57th minute, when the reserve France keeper expertly boxed away a shot from Romain Philippoteaux. \nSome frustrated Marseille fans started to boo and whistle with 15 minutes left to play. Moments later, Alessandrini forced Lecomte into another good diving save to his right with a precise low shot from the edge of the box but the hosts' presssing remained fruitless. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:27:47.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
