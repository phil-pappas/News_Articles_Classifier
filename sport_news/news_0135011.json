Lions’ quarterback Jonathon Jennings (10) during the Bombers 29-26 victory at BC Place on Saturday. Photograph by: Jimmy Jeong , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nThere is no quarterback controversy with the B.C. Lions, absolutely none. \nBut in a Canucks-dominated city which thrives on controversy, particularly of the goaltender variety, Vancouver is always fertile ground for fresh shoots of debate. Such as: \nIs the Lions’ present, not just the future, built around rookie Jonathon Jennings? Or is veteran Travis Lulay the steady hand needed for a faltering 5-9 team as its season threatens to go south? \nReady to assert himself for the first time since coming off the six-game injured list (knee), Lulay was added to the active roster for Saturday’s 29-26 defeat to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, a game in which Jennings demonstrated both youthful brilliance and inexperience. \nWhat Jennings has done in the past three weeks is open a window to a bright future. His performance against Winnipeg and Saskatchewan — seven touchdown passes, restoring a deep ball threat to the Lions’ offence — should generate an honest-to-goodness controversy. Yet after throwing for 307 yards and three scores in the first half against the Blue Bombers, Jennings was limited to 65 yards throwing and zero points in the second (the Lions managed just a punt single and a two-point safety after taking a 23-9 halftime lead). \nAfter completing 16 passes at one point, Jennings was intercepted on an ill-advised 17th attempt. Six passes later, he was picked off again, in an apparent case of miscommunication with receiver Manny Arceneaux. \nThe Lions quarterback was, however, victimized by a dubious holding call on left tackle Tommie Draheim late in the game that wiped out a 56-yard completion to Bryan Burnham which might have produced a different result. Still, it was yet another example of the Lions’ inability to finish a game they seemed to have in control. \n“We just couldn’t make a play to get us over the hump,” observed Lulay, who was dressed as Jennings’ backup. “It’s happened to us at various points this season, particularly in the second half. It’s self-inflicted.” \nWhen the Lions return to the practice field today, the readiness of Lulay to play or start in Saturday’s game in Edmonton will be scrutinized the way Kremlinologists gauged power shifts in the Politburo. \nLulay suffered a no-surgery-required partial tear in his MCL on Sept. 3 against Montreal, but came off the six-game injured list earlier than expected. He is wearing a brace on his left knee and will continue to do so when he takes the field in a game situation. Whether that is as a starter, or a reliever, is a decision left to head coach Jeff Tedford over the next few days. \n“The fact that Jon has played well takes pressure off the organization and myself to try to got in before I’m fit,” Lulay says. “Obviously, it’s great for our team. First and foremost, he doesn’t make the same mistake twice. His decision-making has been impressive. And he’s made some really good, instinctive plays. To stay level-headed, riding the ebbs and flows of a game, shows his maturity.” \nJennings versus Lulay? It’s a situation rife for discussion, if only both men would cooperate. \nAs Jennings’ career has taken off like a rocket, Lulay has been the epitome of a mentor and supportive teammate, awarding the offensive game ball to Jennings after his four-touchdown performance against the Roughriders and counselling the young quarterback in games, practices and team meetings. \nVeteran halfback Ryan Phillips compares the Jennings’ phenomenon with Casey Printers, whose breakout year came in 2004 when he became the Lions’ starter after Dave Dickenson was injured and won the CFL’s most outstanding player award. \nBut whereas Printers had a polarizing personality which split the locker-room into two camps, Lulay has been more big brother than pot stirrer. The concept of Team comes first. That makes him the most divine kind of teammate, one practically bursting to excel and make a difference, yet conscious of making any kind of wave that might disrupt group goals. \n“Being a member of a team, you always put the team above yourself,” Lulay explains. “The team is far bigger. The B.C. Lions and our playoff aspirations are far bigger than me and my story. It’s not in my makeup to be anything but hopeful and happy for Jon Jennings playing well. He led us to a win last week (against Saskatchewan). He played very well against Winnipeg. There really isn’t a part of me that says, ‘Man, I wish he wasn’t playing well.’ What does that say about me, if that was the case?” \nPlay young and be loved as if he were old and wise. It would be the perfect scenario for Lulay. Yet he won’t rush his return just to get on the field and put his team, and himself, in harm’s way. \n“My goal is to get to 100 per cent and be available for my team,” he says, indicating that he’s not quite there yet, but adding: “I could provide for my team, if they need me.” \nLulay is still Travis Lulay. If there is to be a quarterback controversy, we’ll have to make one up ourselves. \nmbeamish@vancouversun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:42:41.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
