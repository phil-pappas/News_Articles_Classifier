Somebody was looking out for me tonight.”\nWeaver is the most Angel of them all at this point, one who has been wearing the halo for a decade. He was an Angel when Trevor Gott, the pitcher who relieved him in this game, was a seventh-grader.\nThis will be the first season out of Weaver’s 10 that he finishes with a losing record and without at least 10 victories. The year has been a struggle for him, his well-chronicled battle with fading velocity continuing.\n“When you’re throwing the stuff I’m throwing up there, against that lineup and in this ballpark, it’s nice to be able to limit the damage and keep us in it,” he said. “That’s what I’ve been trying to do all year, and it’s been hit and miss.”\nIf he were left-handed, Weaver, at his best, would be called crafty. Since he’s right-handed, Weaver often is called other things – at his best and at his worst.\nYet, in a game that was a must-win if not mathematically than at least practically, Weaver gave the Angels six innings worthy of the occasion and of his career, permitting the team that has outscored all but three others in baseball a single run.\nThe only two hits he allowed – a homer and a double – were to Shin-Soo Choo. He walked two of the first three batters he faced but only one other. During one stretch, he retired 11 of 12 hitters.\nAnd, in the fifth inning, he was still plenty strong enough to pick up his shortstop, Weaver pitching around consecutive errors by Erick Aybar and a subsequent double steal that led to runners at second and third through no fault of his own.\n“I’ve been with him longer than anybody on this team, probably 12 years now coming up in the minor leagues together,” Weaver explained of Aybar. “He’s picked me up a bunch. I had to pick him up tonight and was able to do so.”\nWith one out and the Rangers 90 feet from breaking a 1-1 tie, Weaver struck out Chris Gimenez on a changeup that reached 76 mph and retired Delino DeShields on a fly ball off a 74-mph slider, and who says a pitcher needs gas to put out a fire?\n“If that happens,” Manager Mike Scioscia said of Aybar’s back-to-back errors, “a lot of times it’s going to change the flow of the game in a negative way. Weave was able to pitch out of it. Those were two big outs.”\nIn the sixth, Weaver was able to pitch himself and his teammates free again after he permitted Choo’s double leading off, this escape also rewarding Scioscia’s trust in a pitcher who has been with the Angels manager longer than any other.\nWith two runners on, Scioscia allowed Weaver to face consecutive left-handed hitters and he dispatched both.\nThe second was former Angel Josh Hamilton in the sort of situation the baseball gods just love, especially with the Angels still paying Hamilton $60 million over three years as he tries to beat them.\n“His off-speed played against both of them,” Scioscia said. “In that situation, he had the game feel. His stuff was still where it was in the first inning. It wasn’t like he was struggling to do some things. He’s got a way of finding his outs.”\nWeaver found 18 of them against the Rangers, which was big for a team that, each day, is trying to piece together the final outs.\nSo an Angels season that has swung in both directions was stabilized at least for one night.\n“We’ve had a lot of ups and downs this year, probably more downs than ups,” Weaver said. “For us to still be in a situation to make stuff happen, the guys have really come together and done a great job.”\nNow the Angels remain one game behind Houston with two games remaining. They still need some magic, but, thanks to Weaver, on Friday nothing went poof.\nContact the writer: jmiller@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:05:57.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
