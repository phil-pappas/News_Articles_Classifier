AP Photo/Gary Hershorn\nCOMMENTARY\nLogic indicates the New York Jets are for real. A quick analysis of the statistics says the Jets are for real. “ FitzMagic ” (ugh) is real, apparently.\nNo team has been better defensively this season than the Jets under new head coach Todd Bowles. The Jets are allowing an NFL-best 15 points per game through their first five contests of the year, of which they’ve won four. The Denver Broncos’ much-ballyhooed unit, helping keep the team undefeated in spite of Peyton Manning, is averaging two more points per game, second in the AFC.\nNeat. What does it say about the Jets’ prowess that the most offensively explosive team they’ve beaten this season is the Cleveland Browns, 12th in the league averaging 23.5 points per game?\nThe New England Patriots, of course, come into this Week 7 showdown against their AFC East rivals, touting the most prolific offense in the league, averaging 36.6 points per game. That’s a little more than one-third greater than the most difficult opponent the Jets have faced.\nThe NFL’s best defense and its best offense renew acquaintances this Sunday at Gillette Stadium, where Tom Brady vs. Ryan Fitzpatrick would seem a mismatch. But Fitzpatrick has been one of the league’s more underrated quarterbacks this season. Flanked by star running back Chris Ivory and wide receiver Brandon Marshall, Fitzpatrick’s offense has scored 25.8 points per game.\nWithout the boisterous Rex Ryan, it’s been a relatively tame week of trash talking between the Jets and Pats. The degree of seriousness is fitting seeing as this could indeed be the Patriots’ toughest test on the season.\nNo butts about it.\nWho they’re picking\nOur roundup of picks for Sunday’s Jets-Patriots game:\nESPN.com : Eleven out of 12 (Mike Golic) pick the Patriots.\nGreg Cote, Miami Herald : Patriots 27, Jets 23. “Why is this our Game of the Week? Let me count the ways. Only once (in 2004) have these rivals met this deep into a season with a better combined record. It’s for first place in the AFC East. And it’s Tom Brady’s high-scoring Pats vs. Darrelle Revis’ excellent defense. The rivalry misses Rex Ryan tweaking and needling Bill Belichick, but, hey, you can’t have everything! New England’s track record is too strong to pick against. Pats have NFL’s best division record (25-6) since 2010 and are on an 8-1 series roll vs. Planes. Even with all that, though, the bet-line feels big. NYJ barely lost twice last season and will make this a four-quarter battle as well.”\nPete Prisco, CBS Sports : Patriots 27, Jets 17. “This is the game of the week. Who can’t wait to see the Patriots offense against the Jets defense? That will be a treat. The matchup that will decide the game, though, is the Patriots defense against the Jets offense. I think New England wins that battle, and the game.”\nCBS Sports staff : Six out of eight pick the Jets against the spread (New England, minus 8 1/2). Seven of eight pick the Pats straight up.\nPeter Schrager, Foxsports.com : Patriots 31, Jets 17. “The irony of this Jets team is that it’s a squad Rex Ryan dreamed of. Great up front on D, even better in the defensive backfield, and an offense that pounds it on the ground and limits mistakes in the air. As good as they’ve looked, I can’t see them coming into Foxboro and winning. The Patriots had their first challenge last week and they withstood it. I’d say this could be a hangover game, but the Patriots are like you’re one friend from college who never stops—they’re simply immune to hangovers.”\nFoxsports.com staff : Five out of eight pick the Patriots.\nFiveThirtyEight : Patriots with an 84 percent chance of winning.\nSB Nation staff : All New England.\nUSA Today staff : Patriots across the board.\nMike Florio, Pro Football Talk : Patriots 27, Jets 23. “The Jets have the defense to slow down the New England offense, but they don’t yet have the offense to outscore the New England defense. Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick is 1-8 during his career against the Patriots. Make it 1-9.”\nMichael David Smith, Pro Football Talk : Patriots 28, Jets 17. “If the Jets are going to dethrone the Patriots in the AFC East, they’re going to need to win this game. I don’t see it happening. The Patriots are still the best team in the division, and they’ll remain undefeated.”\nMass Live staff : Four out of five pick New England. “If there’s a game where the offense can get derailed, it’s this one. The Jets have probably the NFL’s best interior line going up the Patriots rookies inside. Darrelle Revis is there to wipe a receiver (probably Julian Edelman) off the face of the earth. They also have bigger safeties that have matched up with Rob Gronkowski in the past. They can also run the crap out of the ball.”\nJimmy Kempski, PhillyVoice : Patriots. “A few days ago, we noted just how good the Eagles’ defense has been this season. But holy crap... click that link and take a look at how good the Jets’ D has been. On the season, opposing quarterbacks have a combined 60.9 QB rating. That’s ridiculous. They’re first in the NFL in yards per play, points allowed, yards per pass attempt, points per drive, and yards per drive. If there’s one team that can slow down the Pats’ offense, I believe it’s the Jets. Take the Pats to win, but I like the Jets getting nine.”\nMichael Hurley, CBS Boston : Jets (plus-nine). “I’ve said to anyone who would listen that the Patriots may be the best team in the NFL, but that doesn’t mean they’re a juggernaut. This isn’t 2007. Randy Moss ain’t walking through that door!”\nGlobe staff : Three out of five pick the Jets (New England minus 8 1/2).\nNeil Greenberg, Washington Post : Patriots, 62 percent. “Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis has the second-lowest passer rating against in primary coverage (32.8), allowing just 0.60 yards per cover snap. He could be a problem for Tom Brady and the Patriots’ passing attack.”\nIt says here: Patriots 31, Jets 24 . The Jets haven’t played anyone the caliber of the Patriots. The Patriots haven’t played anyone the caliber of the Jets. At home, bet on New England before we anoint New York an AFC East threat.\nContact Eric Wilbur at: eric.wilbur@globe.com .

The day will be a marathon regardless, so you might as well get yourself situated without being rushed. Greg M. Cooper / USA Today Do: Make yourself at home. Tents are a must, but don't forget about folding tables, chairs, a generator, and decorations to make your tailgate stand out from the crowd. Wendy Maeda / The Boston Globe Don't: Forget the TV. An entertainment center is crucial to any tailgate. You want to be able to watch the games before or after the Patriots play, just as if you were having a football watching party at home. Except this party is way better with thousands of guests. Steve Silva / Boston.com Don't: Bring a truck without a way to lock up valuables. Trucks are great for tailgating, but make sure you have a way to lock up your stuff before going into the game. Otherwise, you may find that a group of teenagers helped themselves to your entire cooler of unsupervised beer. John Bohn / The Boston Globe Do: Dress appropriately for the weather. Start with layers, wearing the least amount and adding throughout the day. During warmer tailgates, avoid flip flops—some of the lots are filled with gravel. During colder tailgates, bring hand warmers to throw in your boots or mittens. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Do: Buy your booze ahead of time. The liquor store on Route 1 doesn't open until noon on Sunday, and the Trader Joe's at Patriot's Place will be packed. Joe Raedle / Getty Images Do: Share with friends. Your neighbors ask if they can call next game? Sure! Have left over wings? Ask who's hungry! Do a solid for your neighbors, so others are more apt to help you when you need something later. You're all one big, happy, tailgate family. Stan Grossfeld / The Boston Globe Don't: Just bring a bag of chips. You're better than that. Try wings, Italian sausage with peppers and onions, steak tips, or at least burgers. Make sure to marinate them well—that way, even if your wings get overcooked while you’re getting another beer, they will still taste good. iStockphoto Do: Bring something warm to eat. It can get cold out there in the fall, and chili is the perfect solution. If you're bringing your chili or soup in a crockpot, bring it to the game already warm. Your car generator will take hours to warm your food from being on ice. Jim Davis / The Boston Globe Don't: Bring pressurized beer. We get that kegs are more convenient for drinking games, but the police are patrolling all of the parking lots, and they will take away your keg or beer ball. Save the kegs for college parties. iStockphoto Do: Bring ways to entertain yourself. Corn hole is the classic go-to lawn game, but try mixing it up this year with some giant Jenga. You can have more players, and it is a great way to make friends with your neighbors. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Do: Partake in traditions. Check out Keith McGovern's tailgate prayer at the lot across from the main Route 1 entrance. Every game, the Massachusetts State Police Mounted Unit stops by to stand at attention, and the tailgaters duct tape any visiting fans who want to attend their party. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Do: Follow the rules of music etiquette. A Patriot's game tailgate is a time for AC/DC Pandora and other classic rock stations. Come up with a good mix that everyone in your tailgating crew will enjoy. Or find the guy with a guitar, because you know there will be at least one in your area. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Don't: Try to bring booze into the stadium. Trust us, $11 for beer inside the stadium is cheaper than bail after you're arrested for trying to sneak in alcohol. iStockphoto Do: Pace yourself. The whole point of tailgating is watching the game, so make sure you actually get there to enjoy it. David Butler II / USA Today Do: Have a post-game plan. Restaurants and bars by the stadium, like Toby Keith's and Bar Louie, won't serve shots after halftime. Either plan to leave early, or save food and drink to continue the party while everyone else is stuck in traffic. Stan Grossfeld / The Boston Globe Don't: Worry about your car. AAA is on site at Gillette and is included in the cost of parking there—so if you lock yourself out or need a jump, just track down a parking lot attendant. iStockphoto Share 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Red Sox NESN ended up with an outstanding Red Sox broadcast team, even if change was never needed 10.23.15 | 5:45 PM Celtics Five key questions facing the Celtics 10.23.15 | 3:56 PM Patriots Jets-Patriots prediction roundup: There’s no bum rush to crown the Jets just yet 10.23.15 | 3:39 PM Patriots 5 keys for the Patriots against the Jets 10.23.15 | 3:29 PM Patriots How this DJ became Gronk’s No. 1 party guy 10.23.15 | 2:54 PM Patriots Wait, Danny Amendola gave away Tom Brady’s 400th touchdown ball? 10.23.15 | 2:47 PM Red Sox Which star from MLB’s final four would you want most in a Red Sox uniform? 10.23.15 | 2:02 PM Baseball Blue Jays first baseman Chris Colabello is living out his father’s dream 10.23.15 | 10:50 AM Patriots Morning Sports Update: Jets player doesn’t want to pump up Tom Brady 10.23.15 | 9:07 AM Celtics Marcus Smart strengthens his case to start at point guard 10.23.15 | 8:40 AM Bruins Wake Up With Wilbur: The Bruins Are Maddening 10.23.15 | 8:36 AM Patriots Playing both sides: These guys have worn Patriots and Jets colors 10.23.15 | 7:06 AM Patriots Stevan Ridley ‘fired up’ about possible return vs. Patriots 10.22.15 | 8:00 PM Red Sox Jerry Remy returning to NESN’s Red Sox broadcast team 10.22.15 | 7:10 PM Bruins In Bruins’ defense, there just really isn’t much to speak of 10.22.15 | 6:44 PM Red Sox Red Sox announce John Farrell’s cancer is in remission after treatment 10.22.15 | 5:36 PM College sports Louisville coach Rick Pitino on website: ‘I will not resign’ 10.22.15 | 2:59 PM Music RadioBDC Sports: Patriots-Jets preview 10.22.15 | 2:45 PM Patriots Patriots troll Jets with butt fumble tweet (then delete it) 10.22.15 | 1:53 PM Patriots What the downfall of Peyton Manning might tell us about the twilight of Tom Brady 10.22.15 | 1:48 PM Red Sox Wake Up With Wilbur: Will Red Sox Pay for Price? 10.22.15 | 8:52 AM Bruins Morning Sports Update: Zac Rinaldo concerned about suspension after ejection against Flyers 10.22.15 | 8:43 AM Local news At least Fenway Park has baseball’s speediest WiFi 10.22.15 | 8:04 AM Patriots Malcolm Butler is a building block for Patriots secondary 10.21.15 | 10:05 PM Red Sox Back to the future?
