Braves promote John Coppolella to general manager \n**UPDATE** \nThe members of Alphi Chi Omega at Arizona State will donate to charity in the wake of the attention their selfie-taking garnered. \n\"Alpha Chi Omega at Arizona State University would like to thank the Arizona Diamondbacks and Fox Sports for reaching out to the chapter after last night’s game and subsequent media frenzy,\" reads a statement posted Thursday night to the sorority chapter's Facebook page . \n\"We appreciate their generous offer of tickets to tonight’s game. However, instead of chapter members attending the game, we have asked the Diamondbacks and Fox Sports to provide tickets to a future game for families at A New Leaf, a local non-profit that helps support victims of domestic violence.\" \nAlpha Chi Omega at Arizona State University would like to thank the Arizona Diamondbacks and Fox Sports for reaching out... Posted by Alpha Chi Omega at ASU on Thursday, October 1, 2015 \n“Help us, please, somebody help us!\" \nThat was the cry from the Chase Field broadcast booth as the Arizona Diamondbacks hosted the Colorado Rockies Wednesday night. \nThe hometown crew wasn't sending out an SOS in hopes of relieving them of their duties as two non-playoff teams played out a rather boring late-season tilt. \nInstead, the concern was over selfies. For two minutes, cameras focused on a group of young women taking selfie after selfie during the bottom of the fourth inning. \nThe commentators, Steve Berthiaume and Bob Brenly , couldn't resist poking fun at the overt narcissism on display. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nChuckling, one of them half-jokingly asks, “Do you have to make faces when you take selfies?” as a woman with a sparkly phone attempts to strike the perfect pose. \n“That's the best one of the 300 pictures I've taken of myself today!” he adds, imitating her with sarcasm at an all-time high. \nThe group reportedly belonged to an Alpha Chi Omega sorority chapter at Arizona State University. \nIf you're unlike these die-hard fans and care about the baseball part of attending a baseball game, the Diamondbacks triumphed 3-1 over the lowly Rockies. Yep, we got the experts themselves to take a #selfie on our @Snapchat !
