The Beavers' next possession, Luani added his second interception to ice the Cougars' (4-2, 2-1) second consecutive win. \n\"Well, first of all he's a really quick guy. I think he's reasonably fast, but he's really quick and then I think it's just kind of coming together for him,\" WSU coach Mike Leach said. \"He's getting into a rhythm, playing faster, he's seeing it better and that type of thing. I thought he really did a good job.\"\nA former soccer player in American Samoa , Luani is in his first season at WSU after transferring from City College of San Francisco. He originally verbally committed to Oregon State, then opted for WSU after coach Mike Riley bailed for Nebraska. As a result, the abysmal WSU secondary from a year ago has benefitted while Luani's big hits have reminded fans of 2014 WSU first-round pick Deone Bucannon. \n\"He definitely brings a lot of intensity,\" said WSU defensive lineman Darryl Paulo. \"I think for a guy who's on the opposing team, the receivers are kind of scared to cross the middle with him back there. He's a very hard hitter and he's fun to watch on film.\"\nLuani has three interceptions on the season, tied for second in the conference, along with Washington defensive back Kevin King and Utah defensive back Dominique Hatfield. \nPrior to Luani, the Cougars hadn't had a defensive player earn Pac-12 player of the week since cornerback Damante Horton had two interceptions, including a pick-six, in a 2013 road win over USC.\nStanford running back Christian McCaffrey was named the conference's offensive player of the week and Arizona State punter Tim White earned special teams player of the week as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:32:57.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
