Dean Mouhtaropoulos / Getty Images Updated Oct 12, 2015 at 8:37a ET \nJuan Mata has expressed his desire to remain in Manchester by declaring his love for the city. \nThe Spain international joined Manchester United from Chelsea in January 2014, during David Moyes' short reign in charge, for a then club-record fee of Â£37.1m \nHe has since established himself as a key player under manager Louis van Gaal and has featured in every match for United this season. \nThe 27-year-old, who is contracted to United until the summer of 2018, says he is content with life in the city and is enjoying the cultural aspects of what Manchester has to offer. \n\"The best thing about living in Manchester is that it has a very 'British' atmosphere, very English,\" Mata told El Pais . \n\"And then there is the music - a lot of really big groups have come out of Manchester. As for the architecture, it's a very English city. \n\"There are galleries, museums, good restaurants - The only down side is the weather. I adapted really well because I had already lived in London. Now I've spent five years in England and it's gone really quickly.\" \nHaving arrived at Chelsea from Valencia in 2011, Mata spent three years living in London before making the move to Manchester. \nDespite enjoying his time in the capital, the midfielder feels more at home in the \"laid back\" city of Manchester. \n\"It only seems like yesterday when I was in Valencia. I'm really happy with how it's all turned out,\" he added. \n\"London is fantastic - it's like various cities in one but it moves so quickly - at a thousand miles an hour, it's a bit crazy. Manchester is more laid back, it's a normal city. \n\"I am very happy in Manchester. I have the feeling that I have only just arrived and I've got a lot of things I want to do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:50:10.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
