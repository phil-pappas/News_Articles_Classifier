But at the same time, with what happened, it’s really tough.”\nThe Blue Jays' season came to a crashing halt Friday when the Royals beat them 4-3 in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series. Tulowitzki hit just .205 in the postseason but did drive in 11 runs.\nTulowitzki, who has six years left on his contract before he becomes a free agent, has seemingly accepted his fate and is ready to restart with his teammates next season.\n“I mean, these guys are great and I’m getting to know them,” Tulowitzki said. “But at the same time, when you don’t spend the whole year with the team, it’s hard to feel settled.\n“I’m excited to go to spring training and get a fresh start with the team and be with these guys for a whole year and not have to worry about trade talks. The last three or four years I had to worry about it and talk about it every single day in Colorado. So, I’m looking forward to having a year where I don’t have to talk about it. It’s going to be great.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/mlb/blue-jays-troy-tulowitzki-never-quite-felt-at-home-in-toronto-this-season-after-shocking-trade-left-him-feeling-betrayed", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/article/4659113-world-series-odds-price-line-new-york-mets-kansas-city-royals-vegas-2015", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658461-mlb-playoffs-2015-american-league-championship-series-photos-pictures-royals-blue-jays-alcs"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:35:25.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
