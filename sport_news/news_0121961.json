By JEFF SEIDEL BALTIMORE — After ending a 24-game losing streak last week, Savannah State wanted to win back-to-back games for the first time in seven years on Saturday. But Morgan State ruined those plans.\nThe Tigers played hard and stayed close into the third quarter, but Morgan State scored all 35 points in the second half and pulled away for a 42-3 victory over Savannah State in a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference game before 2,479 at Hughes Stadium.\nLast week, Savannah State found plenty of offense in a 37-27 victory over Florida A&M, but the Tigers couldn’t repeat that performance. They finished with 313 yards of total offense, but four turnovers, 12 penalties and missed early chances hurt the Tigers.\n“We let the game get away from us,” Savannah State coach Earnest Wilson III said. “We’ve got a young team. We’ve got to learn how to finish. I just felt like we could have played better.”\nSavannah State (1-4 overall, 1-2 in MEAC) moved the ball effectively at times in the first half, mostly on the ground, but the Tigers just could not come up with the big play that give them points. They also lost a first-half touchdown on a penalty.\nQuarterback Arshon Spaulding Jr., the converted wide receiver, ran the offense well, but the Tigers lost running backs Richard Williams II (knee) and Joshua Berry (thumb). Each missed about half of the game with injuries. Morgan State also pressured the Tigers more in the second half, often putting eight and nine on the line in an attempt to force them to throw, which hurt Savannah State.\nSavannah State finished with 160 yards rushing, but just 21 of those came in the second half as the Bears held the Tigers to 84 yards of total offense while scoring those 35 points and racking up 227 yards of their own.\n“We moved the ball (early),” Spaulding said. “We had a lot of good things going on, as far as moving the ball (but) we’ve got a lot to work on.”\nSavannah State’s ability to move the ball — especially on the ground — kept it close early. John Barron kicked a 28-yard field goal with 7:21 left in the first half that cut the Bears’ lead to 7-3, which is where the score remained at halftime.\nIn fact, the Tigers outgained Morgan State 229-129 in the first half and held an edge of four minutes, 31 seconds in time of possession. All that changed, though, in the final two quarters.\nMorgan State (3-2, 3-0) began taking command with good drives to start the second half. Quarterback Moses Skillon, who ran for a touchdown in the first half, added another on a 42-yard run on the team’s first drive of the third quarter. Orlando Johnson then ran for a 3-yard score on the next Morgan State drive to give the Bears a 21-3 lead.\nSkillon threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Marcolm Banks early in the fourth quarter to make it 28-3. The Bears then added a pair of non-offensive touchdowns for 14 more points while scoring 21 in that quarter overall.\nThe first score came when Barron tried a 50-yard field goal that fell short, and Peterson Javier returned it 100 yards for a 35-3 lead with 9:24 remaining in the game. Morgan State linebacker Brandon Griffin then picked up a fumble and returned it for a 30-yard touchdown later in the quarter.\n“We just had to execute, and finally we did,” Morgan State coach Lee Hull said. “Did I expect us to have five touchdowns (in the second half)? No, but I’m happy we did.”\nSavannah St. 0 3 0 0 — 3\nMorgan St. 0 7 14 21 — 42\nSecond Quarter\nMorg_Skillon 3 run (Moller kick), 14:55.\nSav_FG Barron 28, 7:21.\nThird Quarter\nMorg_Skillon 42 run (Moller kick), 11:14.\nMorg_O.Johnson 3 run (Moller kick), 4:32.\nFourth Quarter\nMorg_Banks 34 pass from Skillon (Moller kick), 13:06.\nMorg_Janvier 100 (Moller kick), 9:24.\nMorg_Griffin 30 fumble return (Moller kick), 5:38.\nA_2,479.\nSav Morg\nFirst downs 20 14\nRushes-yards 38-160 35-232\nPassing 153 134\nComp-Att-Int 14-39-3 10-24-0\nReturn Yards (-1) 100\nPunts-Avg. 7-39.7 7-38.3\nFumbles-Lost 2-1 0-0\nPenalties-Yards 12-80 16-166\nTime of Possession 31:32 27:21\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING_Savannah St., Williams II 11-69, Berry 9-34, Prunty 7-21, Spaulding Jr. 5-20, Bentley 6-16.
