(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones says John Calipari landed a huge recruit in Wenyen Gabriel and beat out Duke in the process. \nTonight John Calipari came out here in front of Memorial Coliseum and he addressed the fans on the state of the Big Blue Nation. But what he couldn't talk about but I know he is excited about was the commitment today of Wenyen Gabriel. \nThis was a big deal for Calipari and Kentucky because not only did they get one of the top ten players in the class, and he's unlike anyone Kentuckys had in a long time, but they beat Duke to do it. \nThe problem recently has been as good as Calipari recruits, he honestly does it better than anybody else, Duke has decided to start recruiting the same guy Cal has. They weren't doing that for a long time and thus Calipari could essentially pick his players. But now he has competition and recently hes lost some of those battles, but not this one. \nWenyen Gabriel is 6-10, plays on the wing, can shoot, drive, dunk and is an excellent talent. Duke wanted him. They went to see him Monday night for a desperation plea, but they couldn't get him, Calipari did. So not only does he get a great player, he takes down Mike Krzykewski in the process. That's a big night for Cal and the Cats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:02:30.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
