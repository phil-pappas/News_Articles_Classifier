RUSS aka JENNIFER ANN RUSS aka JENNIFER A. DANA aka JENNIFER ANN DANA aka JENNIFER DANA A Petition for Probate has been filed by: DANIEL WILLIAM GUSE and JEREMY RYAN DANA in the Superior Court of California, County of: Tuolumne. The Petition for Probate requests that DANIEL WILLIAM GUSE and JEREMY RYAN DANA be appointed as personal representative to administer the estate of the decedent. The petition requests the decedents will and codicils, if any, be admitted to probate. The will and any codicils are available for examination in the file kept by the court. THE PETITION requests authority to administer the estate under the Independent Administration of Estates Act. (This authority will allow the personal representative to take many actions without obtaining court approval. Before taking certain very important actions, however, the personal representative will be required to give notice to interested persons unless they have waived notice or consented to the proposed action.) The independent administration authority will be granted unless an interested person files an objection to the petition and shows good cause why the court should not grant the authority. A HEARING on the petition will be held in this court as follows: Date: 11/20/2015 Time: 8:30 a.m. in Dept. 3, at 60 N. Washington St., Sonora, CA 95370 IF YOU OBJECT to the granting of the petition, you should appear at the hearing and state your objections or file written objections with the court before the hearing. Your appearance may be in person or by your attorney. IF YOU ARE A CREDITOR or a contingent creditor of the decedent, you must file your claim with the court and mail a copy to the personal represent- ative appointed by the court within four months from the date of first issuance of letters as provided in section 9100 of the California Probate Code. The time for filing claims will not expire before four months from the hearing date noticed above. YOU MAY EXAMINE the file kept by the court. If you are a person interested in the estate, you may file with the court a Request for Special Notice (form DE-154) of the filing of an inventory and appraisal of estate assets or of any petition or account as provided in Probate Code section 1250. A Request for Special Notice form is available from the court clerk. Attorney for petitioner: TAMARA M. POLLEY, GIANELLI & POLLEY, A professional Law corp. P.O.
