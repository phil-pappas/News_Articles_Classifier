But in no way the animal is killed for consumption since there is a ban on cow killing in the African nation, said Bhagwat, a veterinary doctor by training.\nThey also ensure that while blood is sucked, the cow does not die due to it, Bhagwat added.\nHis remarks came in the wake of controversy over ban on beef consumption in some States, including Maharashtra, and the recent lynching of a man in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, after rumours that he and his family ate beef.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:06:22.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
