Record says school dances in past years have been ‘‘plagued by the culture of grinding.’’\n Record’s post cites a Homecoming Dance a year ago in which students were reminded that grinding was not allowed. He says this led to a walk-out for two-thirds of the students at the dance.\nRecord says activities like bonfires could be more appropriate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T17:43:27.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
