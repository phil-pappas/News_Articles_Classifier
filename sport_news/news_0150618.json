She would have time to qualify for the world figure skating championships in Boston in March by picking up points at sanctioned international competitions. \nAs she has in the past, Kostner admitted she \"made an error,\" by helping her ex-boyfriend, Olympic race walking gold medalist Alex Schwazer, evade a doping test and other infractions. She has said she was unaware he was doping. \n\"This period for me was a moment of great growth and maturation,\" she said, adding she has broken off all contact with Schwazer but did not wish him ill. \nKostner, who missed out on the worlds last year but won bronze at the Sochi Olympics, said she has been concentrating on the artistic aspects of skating since the suspension took effect in January, and will be able to return to full training in federation-sanctioned rinks from Nov. 1. In the meantime, she is preparing for an ice show in Verona this week, and spent last winter in a dance studio practicing ballet. \nKostner said she misses competing but that she had nothing to prove by returning to the rink. \n\"I have a big trove of experience, Olympics that have gone well, Olympics gone badly, falls, getting back up,\" Kostner said. \"In a certain sense, I feel the desire and need to give it all meaning, if only to be part of a team and have the young future Italian champion turn to me and ask advice, 'You, at those moments, what did you do?'\" Olympic bronze medalist Carolina Kostner smiles during a press conference, in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2015.
