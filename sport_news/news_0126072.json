He stated he wants a more athletic team that better suits Safeco Field, organizational depth, more starting pitching and more layers to the bullpen. \nDipoto contends much of this can be addressed “through hard work and good scouting and the use of proper analytics.” This much is clear: The Mariners, under Dipoto, will be far more attuned to analytics. \n“You can turn over a couple of rocks and find a guy here and there,” he said. “You can create depth in a roster that allows you to be competitive quickly.” \nA look at the contract status of current Mariners players and key offseason dates: MARINERS’ 40-MAN ROSTER \n2B Robinson Cano (through 2023) \nOF Nelson Cruz (through 2018) \nRHP Felix Hernandez (through 2019) \nLHP Danny Hultzen (through 2016) \n3B Kyle Seager (through 2021 with option for 2022) \nOF Seth Smith (through 2016 with option for 2017) \nPending free agents (3)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:51:46.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
