The Wildcats turned to fifth-string quarterback Kody Cook, regularly a wide receiver, in last Saturday's loss at Oklahoma State. By Ken Corbitt ken.corbitt@cjonline.com \nMANHATTAN — In six decades as a football coach, it seems Bill Snyder would have seen it all. Never did Snyder, who turned 76 years old on Wednesday, think he would be discussing a fifth- or sixth-string quarterback, but that’s a scenario confronting the Kansas State coach. \nInjuries sidelined Game 1 starter Jesse Ertz and freshman Alex Delton. Joe Hubener was knocked out of last Saturday’s game for a time and replaced by wide receiver Kody Cook because Jonathan Banks, who planned to redshirt, was ill and didn’t make the trip. \nFor a team that entered fall camp with four quarterbacks in the picture, Snyder didn’t envision having to go six-deep and answer questions about the preparedness of Zach Davidson. \nInjuries have also hit other areas of the team, with strong safety Dante Barnett out since the opening game while Cook and wide receiver Dominique Heath were were forced out of last week’s game. \n“I don’t know if it’s happened any place but we’ve certainly set the standard for it, haven’t we?” Snyder said of the injury epidemic. \nQuarterback is the main area of concern. Snyder joked that defensive tackle Will Geary was getting a look, but if Cook is unable to play and Banks is still ill when the Wildcats play No. 2 TCU on Saturday the next man up behind Hubener would be Davidson, a redshirt freshman from Harrisonville, Mo. \n“We have no options,” Snyder said. “That’s not going against anything Zach does, Zach is just young and inexperienced in the offense. He’s still got a lot to learn so we have to do a good job being able to define all the things he can do and does do well and has a good grasp of and make sure we don’t get out of that box.” \nK-State’s quarterback situation took a detour when Tay Bender left school prior to the 2012 season and Daniel Sams transferred after his sophomore year in 2013. Sams is now the starter at McNeese State, ranked No. 13 in the FCS poll, and Bender played two years at Iowa Western Community College — taking over for former Wildcat Jake Waters — and started the first three games this season at Southeast Missouri State before being replaced by true freshman Dante Vandeven. \nErtz won the starting job in fall camp but sustained a season-ending knee injury on the Wildcats’ first offensive play of the season. Delton, a true freshman, hurt his knee in mop-up duty the next week at UTSA and could possibly return this season. Hubener recovered from the head-shot he took last week and Cook’s status for the remainder of the season is unknown, although Snyder said he would continue to practice at both receiver and quarterback. \n“I guess we have to divide him in half,” Snyder said. \n“It’s been a wild roller-coaster ride as far as the quarterbacks,” Hubener said. “It’s a testament to the type of guys we have. Kody Cook is as good an athlete as anybody and he was able to step in and fill those shoes and do a tremendous job. \n“Kody is so versatile. He can really do it all. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see him take some snaps at quarterback still.” \nOr Davidson, if the need arises. \n“That’s not my plan,” Hubener said. “Hopefully, that doesn’t need to happen. \n“Zach is preparing as hard as anybody. He’s studying in the film room, he’s working hard in practice like everybody else. I think he has his mindset that if it happens that he has to come in, he’s going to be ready.” \nWith injuries and personnel issues in the secondary and receiving corps, K-State may have to pull the redshirt off some players such as defensive back Duke Shelley and receiver Isaiah Zuber. \n“We have worked a number of young guys that are first-year freshmen into our team periods,” Snyder said, “so consequently we have prepared guys if indeed we were to have some of the issues we’re having right now. It’s certainly a possibility. We have a number of young guys on both sides of the ball that are prepared if we have to.” \nKen Corbitt can be reached at (785) 295-1123 or ken.corbitt@cjonline.com .Follow Ken on Twitter @KenCorbitt .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:34:35.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
