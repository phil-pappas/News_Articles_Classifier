I texted him after the U.S. Open but I want to say today in a public way, it's amazing the way that he's playing during the whole season,\" Nadal said. \"The mental strength and the level of tennis is difficult to equal.\"\nDjokovic silently accepted the compliments and said he hoped to \"put on the right show and perform well\" for the Bangkok crowd.\nDjokovic and Nadal have faced each other 43 times in tour-level matches, with Nadal winning 23. Djokovic's two wins over Nadal this year were on clay, the Spaniard's best surface.\nBefore Friday's match, the two players will get full VIP treatment with an escorted visit to the Grand Palace followed by a meeting with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.\nDjokovic last came to Thailand in 2008 when he lost the final of the Thailand Open to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, while Nadal visited the capital in 2010 for the same tournament and lost in the semifinals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:45:20.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
