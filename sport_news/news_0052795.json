The Colts defeated the Texans 27-20. Thursday night football is never pretty. The short week makes full recovery nearly impossible, and so these games turn into a war of attrition. Which team is healthiest suddenly matters a lot more than which team is better.\nAdChoices There was nothing healthy about the Indianapolis Colts on Thursday. The team was again without star quarterback Andrew Luck due to injury, and so they turned to 40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck. Hasselbeck spent his Tuesday night in an emergency room, dealing with what he characterized as a bacterial infection. The illness was siginificant enough that the Colts re-signed Josh Johnson as their backup quarterback, two days after cutting him in case Hasselbeck was unable to play.\nHasselbeck did play. He went 18 for 29 with two touchdowns and zero interceptions. The Colts beat the Houston Texans 27-20, and are now on a three-game winning streak after starting the season 0-2. Hasselbeck’s eyes welled with tears after the game , overcome and exhausted.\n“I got nothing left,” he said.\nThe truth is, he doesn’t need to have anything left. Luck will be back in the lineup by Week 6, when the Colts face the New England Patriots. Hasselbeck will return to the bench and barring any unforeseen circumstances, won’t be asked to start another NFL game ever again. There isn’t a high demand for a 40-year-old quarterback.\nIndianapolis is now 3-0 in their division, and appears to have staved off a disastrous beginning. When the regular season ends and the Colts are in the playoffs, they’ll look back on these two games and realize Hasselbeck just saved their season. Sixteen games come and go in a blink of an eye. Over two weeks a season can be lost just as easily as it could be won. You need look no further than the Pittsburgh Steelers to see what so often happens when your starting quarterback goes down.\nHasselbeck delivered a heroic performance Thursday night. The box score is mundane and his stats weren’t pretty. But he got the job done, and the Colts are still alive. Not bad for a Thursday night.\n© Provided by USA Today Sports USA TODAY Sports Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/matt-hasselbeck-gives-emotional-postgame-interview-after-win-over-texans"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:28:58.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
