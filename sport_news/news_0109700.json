Geaux home? Come back! Harry T’s eager to correct stance with LSU fans following social media blitz By KELLY HUMPHREY and WENDY VICTORADaily News By KELLY HUMPHREY and WENDY VICTORADaily News Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 9:20 AM Updated at 5:46 PM By KELLY HUMPHREY and WENDY VICTORADaily News Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 9:20 AM Updated at 5:46 PM DESTIN — Harry T’s Lighthouse restaurant learned what it’s like to grab a tiger by the tail, and General Manager Dan Empson is eager to make amends. Empson was out of town on Saturday when four Louisiana State University fans were turned away from the restaurant during the big football game with the Florida Gators, whose alumni club had reserved the venue’s downstairs section. The incident sparked a heated exchange on social media after one of the LSU fans wrote a letter to the restaurant and posted it on Facebook. Read the Harry T's apology, and Facebook commenters' reaction. By Thursday, Empson had been inundated with 380 angry calls, texts and Facebook messages from unhappy Tiger fans and Louisiana residents. “We dropped the ball,” Empson said. “I’m heartsick that this happened. LSU fans and people from Louisiana are some of our best customers, so we want to make this up to them.” On Thursday afternoon, Harry T’s posted a message on its Facebook page, apologizing for the situation with the LSU fans. The restaurant also announced a GEAUX Game Day Football Party for Saturday’s game against Western Kentucky, with 50 percent of all proceeds going toward an LSU scholarship fund that Harry T’s will donate $2,000 toward. The restaurant also will give a free drink to everyone wearing purple and gold. “The event is open to EVERYONE,” Empson emphasized. He added that going forward, fans of opposing teams would be welcome in other parts of the restaurant when alumni clubs like the University of Florida’s reserve one section of the eatery. The brouhaha began when one of the LSU fans, a Mississippi man named Don Bass, who was apparently in town for a wedding, stopped at the restaurant with his wife and another couple on Saturday. Their visit coincided with that of a UF alumni club, which has been a regular customer of Harry T’s for years, according to restaurant management. The club had requested that fans from the competing team not be allowed in the restaurant when they were there. A sign also was posted in front of the hostess stand advising guests that the room was reserved for Florida Gators fans and alumni. “We’ve built a great rapport with these individuals,” said Lou Longo, assistant manager at the restaurant. “They make money and it goes directly to the University of Florida scholarship fund.” Longo said the alumni club had filled most of the seating, but that restaurant staff made sure the remaining seats were given only to Florida fans. Page 2 of 4 - “I did have to go up to some people and find out their position on the game,” he added. “We wanted to make sure we had plenty of seating for the Florida Gators.” Longo said he had no idea what would ultimately transpire after the game. The LSU fans, who ended up at another Destin restaurant, wrote a letter to the restaurant and posted their complaints on Facebook. A member of the management team responded by explaining they were honoring the request of the alumni club, but that the staff was not intentionally favoring Gator fans. He went on to say that the Gator fans were very “well-behaved” and loyal, and added that LSU “does not carry a good name” at Harry T’s. He said LSU fans had attacked restaurant personnel, not only this year but in years past, and referenced the restaurant’s “trepidation in hosting” LSU. The letter was dated Oct. 20. Bass’ post and the restaurant’s response had been shared on Facebook more than 1,200 times Wednesday evening. Some of those shares were to the Daily News as well as its sister paper, The Destin Log. By Wednesday evening, an apology to LSU fans had been posted on the restaurant’s Facebook page, explaining the reasons for turning the individuals away. It also said the individual who wrote the response letter was no longer a member of the management team. Longo said he’d received at least 40 phone calls about the exchange on Wednesday, but he hoped the apology posted on Facebook would help set the record straight. He also said he’d turned away some Tennessee fans during the game, in order to save the seating for Gators fans. “It was crazy,” Longo said of Saturday’s game, which ended in a 35-28 victory for LSU. “It was a great night.” He added that they’ve had problems with fans representing LSU, as well as Florida and Alabama. “There’s just some people who shouldn’t go out and watch college football in public,” he said. “They’re mean and nasty and make other people uncomfortable.” Previous coverage 315-4478 | @WendyVnwfdn wvictora@nwfdailynews.com DESTIN — An angry LSU fan who was turned away from a Destin restaurant during Saturday’s game against the Florida Gators has sparked a heated exchange on social media.
