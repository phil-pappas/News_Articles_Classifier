Sadananda Gowda said on Friday that he will consult Prime Minister Narendra Modi and legal experts. His statement came after the apex court struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act as unconstitutional and void and restored the collegium system. \"I will go through the text in detail and consult our prime minster, legal experts and others,\" said Gowda, who looked surprised at the order. He said the act represented the will of the people as it was backed by all the members in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. \"The will of the people is represented through parliament. We got the will of the people as 100 percent of the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha members supported it,\" he told reporters. Gowda said he would not comment further. \"I am not going to make any statement as far as this judgement is concerned because I have not gone through it. We have to go through it in detail,\" he added. â€”IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:35:11.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
