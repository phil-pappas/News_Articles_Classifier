So is Dale Earnhardt Jr along with Kyle Busch. Ryan Newman and Brad Keselowski aren’t far behind.\nSunday’s Chase race at Charlotte put each of those drivers in that situation. First, it was Matt Kenseth’s crash into the wall. Then Dale Earnhardt. Jr. had his troubles with Carl Edwards, which later led to him hitting the wall. To top it all off, Kyle Larson and Busch hit each other in a weird pit road incident that left Busch wondering if he’ll ever get any luck when it comes to the Chase.\nMORE: Logano wins | Results | Kenseth blames himself | Chase standings | Kansas schedule\nTechnically, they have one week to fix the situation they are in.\nWhile the next stop in the Chase is Kansas and the running of the Hollywood Casino 400, all eyes will certainly be on the free-for-all that’s likely to happen at Talladega in two weeks. Not only is it an uncertain track where anything (and everything) likely happens, picking the next president is easier than picking a winner there.\nSo drivers really have one week to control their own destiny. After that, anything’s possible.\nPHOTOS: 2015 Cup winners | Gordon's final season | Stockcar Toons | Charlotte race\nLast year it was Kansas that started the Contender Round of the Chase. As was the case on Sunday, Joey Logano won the Kansas race, leading a race-high 122 laps, including the final 29, to advance to the Eliminator Round. Drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jimmie Johnson (crash) finished 39th and 40th, respectively, while Brad Keselowski limped home to a 36th place finish.\nCharlotte didn’t change things much for Earnhardt, Johnson, who were eliminated from the Chase at Talladega. Keselowski improved a little bit the next week then had the fortune of winning the Talladega race to get into the next round. Granted, he would ultimately be eliminated from the Chase in that round, but he had the fortune of winning with a last-lap pass and holding on for dear life for the victory.\nLuckily, Kenseth has fared well in the past at Kansas. So he could bounce back from Sunday’s terrible day. After that, it’s anybody guess.\nOn to the Winners & Losers from Charlotte:\nWinners: Joey Logano\n© Provided by Sporting News Sunday’s finish: 1st\nChase points: 3048 (1st place)\nWinning the Kansas race last season proved to be a big boost for Logano, who made it to the final race with a chance to win his first title. He’s following a similar pattern of consistency this season, winning three times in the past nine races and finishing in the top 10 a total of 12 of the past 13 races. Not that he’ll be relaxing the next two weeks, but he can at least enjoy the ride until the Elminator Round begins at Martinsville.\nKevin Harvick\n© Provided by Sporting News Sunday’s finish: 2nd\nChase points: 3042 (2nd place, -6 behind)\nWhile his win at Dover last week may have been questioned, his performance at Charlotte wasn’t. He was strong all day and did everything but lead a lap and win the race. His finish puts him in much better position for this segment of the Chase than the last one. It was also his 11th runner-up finish this season.\nMartin Truex Jr.\n© Provided by Sporting News Sunday’s finish: 3rd\nChase points: 3041 (3rd place, -7 behind)\nHis best-ever Charlotte finish has him looking good early in this round of the Chase. It came despite a brush with the wall along with some handling issues with 52 laps left. It puts him in much better position at this stage in the Chase than he was even after two of the Challenger races.\nDenny Hamlin\n© Provided by Sporting News Sunday’s finish: 4th\nChase points: 3040, (4th place, -8 behind)\nDespite problems with his primary and backup battery, he still posted his best in the fall race since he finished as the runner-up in the 2012 Chase race. With mistakes by Matt Kenseth and Kyle Busch in Sunday’s race, Hamlin now becomes Joe Gibbs Racing’s best hope to win a title. For now, at least.\nLosers: Matt Kenseth\n© Provided by Sporting News Sunday’s finish: 42nd\nChase points: 3003 (12th place, -45 behind)\nHe finished 42nd after engine problems at Bristol late in the regular season. This time, it was a combination of pit road mistakes, a tire rub and contact with Ryan Newman before he ended up in the garage. He bounced back from his finish at Bristol two weeks later with a win at Richmond in the regular-season finale. With two career wins at Kansas and one at Talladega, he doesn’t need to sweat his status just yet.\nDale Earnhardt Jr.\n© Provided by Sporting News Sunday’s finish: 28th\nChase points: 3016 (11th place, -32 behind)\nIt would be wrong to say his team is in a Chase funk. But something’s not going right for Junior. A right-front tire issue led to him later hitting the wall. He told reporters after the race ‘it ain’t over” for his team and he’s right. With the success he’s had in the past at Talladega, you’d be hard-pressed to count him out until after the checkered flag drops at that track.\nKyle Busch\n© Provided by Sporting News Sunday’s finish: 20th\nChase points: 3025 (10th place, -23 behind)\nHe’ll likely get a couple of apology gifts from Kyle Larson after the mix-up on pit road led to their cars colliding late in the race. Busch bounced back after running out of gas at New Hampshire with a solid finish at Dover to advance in the Chase. He’s gonna need to pull another rabbit out of his hat at either Kansas (no wins, one top-five, worst driver rating and average finish of Chase drivers in 15 races) or Talladega (one win, four top-fives in 20 races).\nRyan Newman\n© Provided by Sporting News Sunday’s finish: 15th\nChase points: 3029 (9th place, 19 behind)\nHe got as high as eighth early and was running 11th before his run-in with Matt Kenseth. Still, finishing 15th isn’t cause for complete concern. He was in 11th place after the second race in the Challenger Round of the 2014 Chase and ended up leading three other weeks in the standings before placing second overall. So it can be done … he’s just going to have to use some of that magic again starting at Kansas, where he has just three top-10 finishes in the past 16 races.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-12/nascar-sprint-cup-kansas-hollywood-casino-400-time-tv-channel-schedule-online-streaming-information-pole-qualifying-winner", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-03-04/2015-nascar-sprint-cup-winners-photos-jimmie-johnson-joey-logano", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-11/nascar-sprint-cup-chase-charlotte-joey-logano-final-race-results", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-03-05/jeff-gordon-retirement-nascar-sprint-cup-photos-2015-daytona-atlanta-talladega", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-11/nascar-sprint-cup-chase-charlotte-joey-logano-wins-kevin-harvick-crashes", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657915-nascar-sprint-cup-chase-grid-standings-hollywood-casino-400kansas-city-gordon-harvick-kenseth-hamlin-busch", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-11/matt-kenseth-chase-nascar-sprint-cup-crashes-charlotte-bad-finish-trouble", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4631786-stockcartoons-2015-dale-earnhardt-jr-danica-patrick-brad-keselowski-jeff-gordon-fights-wrecks", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657909-bank-of-america-500-charlotte-photos-pictures-nascar-racing-joey-logano-jimmie-johnson-matt-kenseth", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:01:31.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
