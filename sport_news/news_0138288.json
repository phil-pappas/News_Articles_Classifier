But now Manchester City has a benefit because they are playing at home and that's a difference. \n\"You have the benefit of the recuperation. Manchester City don't have the travel we have so they have more rest. There is nothing you can do. They have the benefit. \n\"We do a lot of things to try and help. We have cold baths, we have warm baths, less training sessions and practice so the freshness is good enough to beat City. \n\"But first we have to beat Moscow.\" \nUnited made the 1,600-mile journey east yesterday - the night before they face Group B rivals CSKA. \nTo help their recovery, the squad will stay in Russia tonight, rather than travel home straight after the match, as is customary. \nAt his pre-match press conference, Van Gaal bristled at suggestions Marcos Rojo, who used to play for Spartak Moscow, is not realising his potential at United. \nThe Red Devils boss brought the Argentinian to Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon for £16million last summer. \nHe said: \"I didn't know that he played for Spartak but I have seen him in the World Cup in Brazil and he did it very well and he played also for Sporting Lisbon, there I have analysed him. \n\"What I like is that he is physically a very strong guy, a good header and his pass is fast. That we need, always.There is the potential in him to be a very good player for Manchester United.\" \nCity boss Manuel Pellegrini did not agree with Van Gaal that United will have a disadvantage on Sunday.
