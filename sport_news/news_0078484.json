Otaro Alaka appeared to get banged up in the Arkansas game, and coach Kevin Sumlin wouldn't update his status this week.\n\"From a technical standpoint, we've got some learning that we need to accelerate,\" Chavis said.\nFollow Kate Hairopoulos on Twitter at @khairopoulos .\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/khairopoulos", "https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:28:41.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
