(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \n96 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Detroit — It’d be nearly impossible to describe all the mistakes the Lions, Bears and possibly the officials made Sunday at Ford Field.\nBut, after more than 71 minutes of football, the Lions (1-5) finally won their first game of 2015 and can finally end any discussion about another winless season.\nAfter a 57-yard pass from Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson, Lions kicker Matt Prater made a 27-yard field goal to give them a 37-34 win over the Chicago Bears with less than 2 minutes, 30 seconds remaining in overtime.\nStafford also threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Johnson with 21 seconds to cap what appeared to be a fourth-quarter comeback on a day in which the Lions’ offense finally made good on its potential.\nInstead, with the Lions up 34-31, the Bears used the remaining time to drive to the Detroit 11 on three snaps — completions of 25 and 24 yards to wide receiver Alshon Jeffery and a 20-yard pass interference against Lions cornerback Darius Slay — and Robbie Gould made a 29-yard field goal at the buzzer to force overtime.\nBOX SCORE: Lions 37, Bears 34, OT \nBesides, the officials played a large role in the drive that produced the Lions’ go-ahead touchdown. Stafford was flagged for intentional grounding, and on the next play, an incompletion seemingly gave them fourth-and-goal at the 12. Instead, Bears linebacker Pernell McPhee hit Stafford low and late to set up the touchdown to Johnson.\nThe Lions overcame three second-half turnovers to take that late lead, giving the Bears the ball twice on punt returns with TJ Jones muffing one and Corey Fuller accidentally kicking another. Stafford threw an awful fourth-quarter interception, too.\nStafford finished the game 27 of 42 for 405 yards with four touchdowns and the one pick. Johnson added six catches for 166 yards, and Lance Moore had five catches for 106 yards. The Lions also had a season-high with 155 rushing yards.\nFor the Bears, Jeffery was excellent after missing the last four games, finishing with eight catches for 147 yards and a touchdown. Quarterback Jay Cutler was 26 of 41 for 353 yards with one touchdown and one interception.\nThe Lions will also be involved in some controversial officiating discussions this week as wide receiver Golden Tate had a second-quarter touchdown that was initially called an interception before officials overturned it and decided he completed the process of the catch before Bears cornerback Kyle Fuller knocked it loose in the end zone.\nIn the first half, the Lions offense showed the potential many people expected this season. Stafford led a crisp touchdown drive on the opening series, eventually scoring on a 20-yard pass to wide receiver Lance Moore as the Lions took a 7-0 lead with 9:29 left in the first quarter.\nThe Bears offense looked good at the start of the game, too, as receiver Eddie Royal gained 30 yards on a screen to move Chicago to the 10 on its opening drive. But after the Bears reached goal-to-go, Lions linebacker Josh Bynes came up with two key plays, a tackle for loss on first down and a pass break-up on third down. Chicago settled for a 27-yard field goal to cut the Lions’ lead to 7-3 with 4:48 left in the first quarter.\nAfter a three-and-out by the Lions, the Bears methodically moved down the field with a 10-play touchdown drive, capped by a 1-yard run by former Michigan State running back Jeremy Langford.\nDown 10-7 in the second quarter, the Lions responded quickly with a touchdown drive that lasted just 3 minutes and 31 seconds. On the fourth play of the ensuing drive, Stafford hit Johnson for a 43-yard gain. Two plays later, Stafford made an impressive throw on the move to tight end Tim Wright for an 8-yard touchdown as the Lions jumped ahead, 14-10, with 9:17 left in the second quarter.\nThe offensive success continued for the Bears, though, as they responded with a 23-yard field goal by Gould, cutting the lead to 14-13 with 4:50 left in the second quarter. The Lions were fortunate to hold Chicago on the drive after the Bears had first-and-goal from the 5, reaching that point after a 45-yard deep pass from Cutler to Jeffery.\nBut the Lions weren’t content with their lead and answered with a well-executed 4-minute drill. Stafford and Johnson connected for a 39-yard pass along the sideline that resembled many of the one-on-one matchups the Lions have exploited during Johnson’s career. A few plays later, Stafford threw a 2-yard touchdown to Tate, though the play was initially ruled an interception as it was unclear whether he completed the all-important process of the catch before Kyle Fuller poked it free in the end zone.\nFortunately for the Lions, the officials overturned the initial ruling, and the Lions took a 21-13 lead into halftime.\nThe Bears opened the third quarter with another nice drive, but the Lions defense made a play at a huge moment to prevent them from scoring. Lions cornerback Rashean Mathis got beat for a 46-yard gain by receiver Marquess Wilson, but two plays later, Mathis caught an interception in the end zone.\nThe Lions couldn’t do anything with the turnover, though, as they went three-and-out. The defense forced a punt by the Bears on the next drive, but then, the special teams blunders began for the Lions.\nReturn man TJ Jones muffed a punt with Joshua Bellamy standing near him, and Bellamy quickly recovered to give the Bears the ball at the Detroit 19. The Lions defense stood its ground again and held Chicago to a 38-yard field goal, but the Bears still trimmed the lead to 21-16 with 5:12 left in the third quarter.\nThe Lions answered the score as Matt Prater kicked a 39-yard field goal on the next drive, making it 24-16 with 1:05 left in third quarter. A 42-yard pass from Stafford to Moore put the Lions in scoring range on the second play of the possession.\nThen, as the game reached the final quarter, the Lions kept making mistakes, and the Bears were ready to take advantage. The Lions defense forced a punt after just four plays, but the ball bounced off Corey Fuller’s left foot and Chris Prosinski recovered for the Bears.\nChicago started the drive at the 21 and scored three plays later on an 11-yard touchdown pass to Jeffery, making it 24-23 with 12:27 remaining.\nStafford threw an ugly interception on the third play of the ensuing drive as he tried to flip the ball to Theo Riddick then saw Jonathan Anderson make the pick.\nThe Bears started the next drive at the Detroit 24 and eventually scored on a 2-yard run by Forte. After Cutler threw to Forte to convert the 2-point conversion, Chicago led 31-24 with 7:50 left.\nThe Lions offense stalled on the next drive, but a fake punt — a 32-yard, direct-snap run by safety Isa Abdul-Quddus — converted a fourth-and-2. But the offense stalled again, and the Lions settled for a 32-yard field goal, despite trailing by 7, with 2:50 remaining.\nThen, a defensive stop and touchdown gave the Lions a lead before Gould’s field goal as time expired forced an ugly game to continue.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:39:36.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
