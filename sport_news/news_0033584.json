The ‘Caps have three losses and two draws over their past five MLS matches.\nAfter Barrios opened the scoring in the 32nd minute, Dallas had a chance to extend the lead with a penalty kick shortly before half-time. David Ousted dove to his right to stop Diaz from the spot and keep it a one-goal game.\nDiaz would end up extending the lead about seven minutes into the second half though, as he beat Ousted on a single-handed effort.\nThe Whitecaps managed just a single shot on target in the defeat and it was turned aside by Jesse Gonzalez. They had six attempts miss the goal and three more blocked.\nVancouver (15W-5D-13L) can no longer earn the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs. The ‘Caps trail Dallas by four points, and Vancouver has just one game left. The Whitecaps host Houston Dynamo on Oct. 25 at BC Place.\nLocal Sports | mls | soccer | Whitecaps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:56:23.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
