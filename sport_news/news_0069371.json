He took a basketball offer from the Colgate Raiders, and spent three seasons as a starter before wrapping up his eligibility with the central New York state team last season. Jake, 21, followed, and he picked the Boise State Broncos, where he’s a redshirt sophomore tight end on their football team. \nFinally there was Madalyn, 19. She’ll play her freshman season in one of the NCAA’s newest sanctioned sports, beach volleyball, this coming spring with the Pepperdine Waves, a program based in Malibu, Calif. \nThe quartet, according to dad Fred, received between five and 10 pieces of mail per day from schools during the heart of their respective recruiting processes. \nFour kids, three sports, four marquee schools. \nIt’s not a story we hear often. \n“We trained like spartans,” says Craig. \nHe’s kidding. They weren’t moulded like those ancient warriors. They did have basketballs in their hands at an early age, which was in part a tie to Fred having been talented enough on the hardwood at Grand Valley State University, a smallish school back then in Allendale, Mich., that he received a tryout with the Detroit Pistons after wrapping up his university eligibility in 1973. He would be inducted into the Grand Valley hall of fame in 1989. \nA lot of their upbringing does sound familiar, though. As kids they revelled in such things as living room sumo, which involved taking cushions off the sofa and running at each other as hard as they could to see who bounced where. \nThere was also a little game that could called “Sister Toss.” The Lions list Craig at 6-foot-5 and 265 pounds. He was pegged at 6-foot-5 and 236 pounds coming out of high school. \nWhen he was in about Grade 9 and Madalyn was in about Grade 4, she would ask him to pick her up and throw her onto the couch, using it like a trampoline. He would beg off as long as he could, but eventually he would relent. \n“I don’t know how many things in the house we’ve broken. We probably owe Mom $100,000,” Madalyn says of Fred’s wife Cynthia. \nFred adds of his children: “They love each other. They admire each other. But there were fights. Now that they’re all out of the house, we’re starting to patch up all the drywall.” \nFred says the food bill when they were growing up was “horrific,” and because there’s just a big enough gap in his three sons’ ages that only once was he able to get them on the same club basketball team. \nWhen the kids were in middle school and early on in high school, the Rohs had a conversion van, and they would pile the family into it for weekend basketball tournaments. They often had to rely on other families to help get their kids to games and practices. \n“They were always all going in different directions,” Fred says. \nIt continued. Fred, who lists himself as an entrepreneur by trade, would often watch Jake’s high school team play on Friday night, take a red-eye flight after the game to wherever Craig was playing with Michigan the next day, then fly home Sunday. He guesses that he missed only three or four of Craig’s games with Michigan over his four years there. \nThere was one weekend where Jake was in the state championship game, Luke’s Colgate team was meeting Syracuse and Craig’s Michigan side was facing Ohio State. \nFred went to Jake’s game, Cynthia went to Craig’s, and they watched a tape of Luke’s game when they both returned home afterwards. \n“That was a tough one to divide up,” Fred says. \nDon’t feel too bad for Luke, though. He’s parlayed his economics studies at Colgate into a job in New York with BNP Paribas, one of the largest banks in the world, whose headquarters is in Paris. \nHe, like Jake and Madalyn, got a head start on the NCAA experience from what Craig went through. He was the “forerunner” for the other siblings, according to Fred. \n“They knew what they liked, they knew what they didn’t like,” Fred explains. \nMadalyn adds: “I learned a lot of the pros and cons from watching my brothers. When it came time for me to be recruited, I already knew how to talk to coaches. I knew what was good to say, and what wasn’t good to say.” \nMadalyn tags Craig as a “great role model,” and says that she’ll call for something as seemingly routine as, “I had a bad practice yesterday ... my mind is not right.” \nJake, too, says that Craig gave him an opportunity to “see how things are done.” \nIt hasn’t been simple for Craig. He’s had to battle since wrapping up his Michigan career. He was passed over in the 2103 NFL draft, signing instead with the Carolina Panthers as a free agent. After being cut there, he had a stint with the Omaha Mammoths of something called the Fall Experimental Football League. And he’s been used both at defensive end and defensive tackle with the Lions. \nHe goes into Saturday’s game in Edmonton with 18 tackles and five sacks. \n“There’s always a learning curve,” Roh says of his first year with the Canadian game. \n“But now I feel like I’m hitting my stride.” \nsewen@theprovince.com \ntwitter.com/steveewen « Previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:38:51.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
