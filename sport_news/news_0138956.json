Surgery to stabilize the bone would keep him sidelined until late in the season, making it likely the Bears would place him on Injured Reserve.\nPredictably,coach John Fox would only rule out Montgomery for Sunday’s game in Kansas City.\n“He sets everything,” said guard Matt Slauson, who moved to center in a pinch Sunday. “The communication is so fast with him in there. And not that it’s not with me, but because I have to move. Now a new guy comes in in my spot and now we got two guys playing out of position. So when Will is there, I don’t have to worry about anything. So it’s a big loss for us.”\nWhat the Bears do next will be telling: rookie Hroniss Grasu is technically their backup center, but he’s been inactive the first four weeks.\nWhen asked if Grasu was ready to start, Fox simply said he was a “very talented player.” Later, he said that his knowledge of the Bears’ offense was a point in his favor, compared to someone they’d sign off the street.\n“There’s definitely a place for the smaller centers,” Slauson said of Grasu, who is 6-3, 297 pounds. The” only problem is, I can’t help him, technique-wise, because I don’t play like that. Everything I try to tell him is, just embrace your size and your gifts — because he’s able to do a lot of things that I can’t, speed and athleticism-wise, and as far as bracing against a really big guy, I think he’d be fine with that.”\nMontgomery signed a one-year deal this offseason after playing for coach John Fox on the Broncos.\nFollow me on Twitter @patrickfinley\nEmail: pfinley@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:05:55.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
