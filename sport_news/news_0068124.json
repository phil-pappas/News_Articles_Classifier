He helped the B's end a season-opening, three-game losing streak on Wednesday at Colorado. Comment Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 8:31 PM Updated at 8:36 PM Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 8:31 PM Updated at 8:36 PM Wednesday night’s 6-2 victory at Colorado notwithstanding, Bruins coach Claude Julien probably still has some lineup decisions to make. Brad Marchand has shed the no-contact jersey he has worn in practice since sustaining a concussion last Saturday. Once he’s cleared to play, Julien must decide what to do with the two lines he changed to cover for Marchand’s absence. Defenseman Zach Trotman has been a healthy scratch for the last three games, and rookie Colin Miller is coming off his first shaky outing. Julien may consider a change there, too. There’s almost no doubt, though, that the coach will not use one of Wednesday’s top performers when the Bruins end their two-game trip on Saturday night at Arizona (10:05, NESN, WBZ-FM/98.5). Jonas Gustavsson, a 20-save winner on Wednesday at Denver, will almost certainly give way to No. 1 goalie Tuukka Rask, who is 0-3 with a 4.72 goals-against average and .846 saves percentage. As prepared as he was to face the Avs on Wednesday, Gustavsson entered the season knowing he must be prepared for long waits between appearances. “I try to take advantage of the practices,” said Gustavsson, who turns 31 at the end of next week. “That’s pretty much all you can do.” A former No. 1 goalie in Toronto, Gustavsson wasn’t re-signed after three injury-riddled seasons in Detroit (groin, shoulder, concussion) and attended the Bruins’ training camp on a tryout basis. Despite making only two appearances and posting almost identical preseason statistics to career minor-leaguer Jeremy Smith, Gustavsson was given a one-year contract for $700,000 and the job of backing up Rask, who wore down over a franchise-record 70 appearances last season. Gustavsson’s NHL experience (149 games), plus experience as a backup, helped him win the job, and he thinks it will help him keep it. “You’ve got to be a pro, every day,” he said before the B’s hit the road. “No matter if you’re not going to play for two weeks, you’ve got to go to the rink every day and make sure you’re preparing the best way you can. “That’s what I’ve learned over the years. You can’t take a couple days off just because you think you’re not going to play in the next week. You’ve got to make sure you’re really on top of everything because otherwise you’re going to lack focus here and there. Then bad habits lead to other bad habits.” Gustavsson was focused at one of Wednesday’s biggest moments. With the then-winless B’s holding a 2-0 first-period lead – as they had in Monday’s 6-3 loss to the Lightning – he made a critical save on Mikko Rantanen’s breakaway with eight minutes left. Page 2 of 2 - “You know that sooner or later you’re going to get a chance,” said Gustavsson, “so no matter what, you try to stay focused. “You’ve got to handle yourself like you’re the starting goalie, even though you’re not playing.” Around the boards: The Coyotes won their first three games before falling on Thursday to the visiting Wild, 4-3. They’ve been led by Anthony Duclair (4-2–6) and Max Domi (3-3–6), who are tied for the NHL’s rookie scoring lead. ... The Bruins have won the last six meetings between the teams, including the last four at Arizona. ... David Krejci (3-3–6) has scored at least one point in all four games to date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:49:59.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
