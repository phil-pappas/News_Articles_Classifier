The Essex County championship race is set for Oct. 30, at Brookdale Park, in Bloomfield. Following the county race, the team will prepare for the NJSIAA state sectional championships on Nov. 7. \nLeading the boys at the conference championship race was Danny Guerra, who ran 20:11.40 over 5,000 meters and finished 28th overall. Armando Calado was next across for the Bucs, running 20:50.90 and finishing 35th overall. Other top performances for the Bucs included Daniel Castano (21:50.00, 43rd place), Mark Tarazona (21:55.30, 44th), Mayck Calle (23:02.20, 52nd), Arik Odre (23:19.20, 55th) and Andres Pasuizaca (23:39.10, 57th). \nIn the two-mile run, Sebastian Perez ran 20:57.60. \nFor the girls, Allison Diaz was first across for the Bucs, running 24:27.70 and finishing a solid 16th. Ilce Perez was the next to cross for the Blue and Gold, running 24:43.40 and taking 18th. Sara Manning (25:18.90, 23rd), Ann Maria Albert (25:24.80, 25th), Camillah Nigatu (26:40.70, 29th), Chiarize-Crish Bulusan (29:24.40, 59th) and Bernice Banks (31:46.50, 67th) rounded out the varsity effort for Belleville. \nIn the girls' two mile run, Jehann Dabon (18:20.40) and Nancy Vu (23:28.20) also did a good job. \nAt an invitational at Garret Mountain last Saturday, Dabon and Julian Roca ran the two mile for the Bucs. The top female finisher for Belleville in the varsity 5000 meters was Perez, while Castano led the boys. \n\"We saw some personal bests this week, and it was a continued progress for our young student athletes,\" said BHS coach Nick Campione. \"We have four meets remaining, and it is important that our athletes continue progressing to personal and season bests.\" \nEmail: Mike051893@aol.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:29:04.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
