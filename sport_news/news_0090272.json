Tesla unveiled the system in a blog post Wednesday. It will be added to some Model S sedans and Model X SUVs through a software update. Like other semi-autonomous systems from Mercedes, Audi and Volvo, Tesla's system automatically keeps the car within its lane and maintains a certain distance from the car in front. It can find a parking spot and parallel park itself. It also uses cameras and sensors to warn drivers about potential side impacts.
