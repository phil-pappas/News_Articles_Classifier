The two teams had played to a scoreless deadlock through 80 minutes of regulation time and 20 minutes of overtime before the Ironmen prevailed, 4-3, in the shootout. \nEisold, a 6-foot, 165-pound senior co-captain and three-year starter, had been battling a lower back injury that had kept him sidelined for most of the past two weeks. But after playing the second half of Don Bosco’s 5-0 BCT play-in win over Fair Lawn on Saturday, Eisold was inserted into the Fort Lee game with 3:32 left to play in the second overtime, replacing starter William Shim. \nAfter Shunsaku Sagawa had scored for Fort Lee and Matthew McGovern got the equalizer for Don Bosco in the first round of the five vs. five shootout, Eisold came up big in the second round when he denied Fort Lee’s leading scorer, senior Justin Picache (11 goals, four assists), with a nifty block. \n\"I really read him well; I saw by his eyes where he was trying to go,\" said Eisold. \nMartin Boyle, Yasin Dombayci and Mike Helgesen followed by converting for Don Bosco and Jared Brusco and Nick Garita did the same for the Bridgemen, making it 4-3. Fort Lee’s fifth shot sailed high and wide right, sealing the victory and leading to a Don Bosco celebration. \nFifth-seeded Fort Lee (7-2) was looking to advance to its first BCT quarterfinals ever. Don Bosco (7-4), winners of four games in a row, originally had been left out of the tournament. \nThe Ironmen were only able to get to this point by defeating NV/Old Tappan, 1-0, in a Big North interdivisional game Tuesday night — that allowed Bosco entrance into the play-in bracket (the win over 12th-seeded Fair Lawn). \nFort Lee coach Demba Mane said after the game that he would file a formal appeal of the loss because of a Don Bosco player eligibility situation. \nThat appeal could be registered with the Bergen County Coaches Association or the NJSIAA, or both, Tuesday because school is closed today for the Columbus Day holiday. \nThe Bridgemen were also upset that as a fifth seed, they had to play Don Bosco, granted a 21st slot into the original 20-team tournament – but a team that is probably one of the best seven or eight teams in the county. \n\"I know Don Bosco’s argument was a strong schedule, but .650 [winning percentage] was an automatic bid and we were 6-0 at the time of the seedings,\" Mane said. \"Don Bosco was .500 [4-4] at the time of the seedings, and the tournament committee says teams .500 or above can be considered but aren’t automatic. \n\"My argument is that we shouldn’t have had had to take on an opponent as strong as Don Bosco in the first round; we should have been playing Fair Lawn or someone like that. We’ve never advanced to the quarterfinals in the tournament’s history before and this was a golden opportunity.\" \nAlso playing an extremely strong game in the net was Fort Lee senior Moahamed Abdelhamid, who made 10 saves, many of the spectacular variety, and stopped a penalty kick by Dombayci with 30:40 left in the second half. \n\"I don’t think he’s just the best goalie in the league [NJIC], he’s the best goaltender in the county, bar none,\" Mane said. \n\"He really came up with some incredible stops and kept us in the game.\" \nEmail: mills@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:28:40.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
