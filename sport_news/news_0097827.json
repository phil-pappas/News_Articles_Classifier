The abuse reportedly involves forced labour, drug trafficking, sexual abuse and prostitution rings in Rome.\nIn an interview with Reuters' Aswat Masriya in September, the head of the International Organisation for Migrationâ€™s Egyptian office said that there was an alarmingly high percentage of undocumented child migrants moving to Europe. He also added that Italy received 4,000 Egyptian migrants in 2014, 2,000 of whom were minors unaccompanied by parents or relatives.\nMakram also said that looking after Egyptian immigrants abroad was not only the responsibility of the Ministry of Immigration, but rather a common responsibility with the ministries of defence, interior and education.\nShe also stressed on the necessity of using religious discourse in order to capitalise on the religiosity of Egyptians to encourage families to care for their children so as to lessen this type of emigration.\nIn recent years, thousands of Egyptians have attempted to cross the Mediterranean in search of better work opportunities, with hundreds facing arrest when attempting to cross the Italian border.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:32:30.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
