Argentina will be the outsider in the group but is a live contender.\n“We have played in the Rugby Championship for the last four years,” Argentina’s coach, Daniel Hourcade, said, referring to an annual competition that includes Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. “This has prepared us to play at this level of intensity on a weekly basis, so we will be ready.”\nArgentina’s return to the final four buried any fears that its first such appearance, in 2007, might be a glorious one-time event, in the vein of Bulgaria’s run in the 1994 soccer World Cup and Kenya’s in the 2003 cricket World Cup.\nIreland, the team Argentina vanquished on Sunday, is the two-time defending champion of the Six Nations Championship, an annual competition among top European teams, and it usually plays well at Millennium Stadium. The Pumas, though, had history with Ireland, having earned their first World Cup playoff victory, in 1999, against the team and beaten it to clinch their pool on the way to the 2007 semifinals.\nThis time, in a gripping, fluctuating contest, Argentina led from the start. It swept to a 17-point lead in the first 13 minutes and then allowed Ireland to claw its way back, to the point where its fly-half Ian Madigan could have tied the score at 23-23 with a 59th-minute penalty. Madigan’s shot slid outside the post, though, and Ireland did not get as close again.\n“Getting back to 23-23 would have been a massive confidence boost for a team which was probably lacking a bit of experience,” said Ireland’s coach, Joe Schmidt, who was missing four first-choice players and lost a fifth, wing Tommy Bowe, to an early injury.\nInstead, Argentina pulled away with late tries by fullback Joaquín Tuculet and the brilliant wing Juan Imhoff, and fly-half Nicolás Sánchez, named the man of the match, took his points tally with the boot to 23.\n“I don’t know how to explain it,” said Argentina’s ecstatic captain, Agustín Creevy. “We have been looking for this for a long time. I can’t come to terms with it. We’re in the semifinal.”\nThis was no fluke, and Argentina’s play offered one answer to a question bandied about on Saturday night, after France fell to New Zealand in a record loss: Whatever happened to the flair of the French?\nIt seems possible that it moved south and crossed the Atlantic: Argentina’s devastating opening — with slick passing involving both backs and forwards, players seeking space rather than contact and the whole width of the field being used — had echoes of French teams at their best.\nA brilliant first try, after less than three minutes, epitomized those virtues. Tuculet leapt to reclaim a high kick deep in Irish territory, and back rower Pablo Matera drove forward. When Argentina moved the ball fast to the right, back rower Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe nonchalantly picked a poor pass off his toes and unloaded a long pass that put wing Santiago Cordero into space. He drew the final defender to send center Matías Moroni over in the corner.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Cordero was involved in the second score five minutes later, kicking across after a slick stretch of passing to allow Imhoff to beat Irish defenders for a try. Sánchez kicked both conversions, and Argentina led, 14-0.\nSchmidt could still be, in his own words, “incredibly proud” of the way his team fought back. Ireland, which has never won a World Cup playoff game, was missing its injured captain, Paul O’Connell, who was cheered every time he appeared on the stadium’s big screens, as well as the key playmaker Jonny Sexton and two other first-choice forwards; the team easily could have concluded that all was lost.\nIn addition, the Irish attacks lacked the fluency of the Argentines’. Passes went astray, and promising positions were lost when the ball was taken back into defensive cover rather than moved wide.\nBut Ireland battled on, with Bowe’s replacement, Luke Fitzgerald, making two decisive interventions. In the 29th minute, he was at the shoulder of center Robbie Henshaw to take the pass and score after Henshaw made a slashing break. Then, four minutes after halftime, it was Fitzgerald’s break that set up a try by flanker Jordi Murphy, cutting Ireland’s deficit to 3.\nFor the next 20 minutes, the game hung in the balance. Sánchez and Madigan exchanged penalties, Madigan missed his potential equalizer, and Sánchez made it 26-20.\nOnly when Tuculet forced his way over in the 69th minute after another sweeping cross-field move did Argentina appear secure. Four minutes later, Lobbe broke the defense with a sublime dummy to send Imhoff sailing to the corner, and the ecstatic celebrations from Argentina’s coaches showed that the job was done.\nLater in the day, at Twickenham Stadium, Australia needed a last-minute penalty from outside-half Bernard Foley to beat Scotland. Australia scored five tries to three, but the team trailed at halftime and again near the end, after the Scottish center Mark Bennett had scored an interception try.\nWing Drew Mitchell scored two tries for Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:23:56.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
