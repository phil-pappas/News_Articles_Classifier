Richard Brown Published: Saturday, October 24, 2015 at 11:15 p.m. Last Modified: Saturday, October 24, 2015 at 11:15 p.m. \nTAMPA — Tampa Bay has seen the stats of Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins and the unit is likely licking its chops for a chance to get after him. But the club knows if it wants a chance to harass Cousins, it must stop the Washington run game. \n“With every quarterback, one of the keys is can you rush and make him uncomfortable in the pocket?” said Tampa Bay defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier. “If you can’t, this is still the NFL. The guys will really pick you apart. We’ve got to make him uncomfortable in the pocket as best as we can, whether it’s four-man rush or when we bring pressure; get him off the spot a little bit. \n“That starts with our being able to defend their run game where their quarterback has to make a lot of throws,” Frazier continued. “He’s more than capable. He can easily get away from those picks if you give him time like any NFL quarterback.” \nIt hasn’t been a strong beginning for Cousins who is 31st in the league in quarterback rating; a couple of percentage points ahead of Tampa Bay rookie quarterback Jameis Winston. \nTampa Bay is tied for eighth in the league with 15 sacks and will get a chance to improve those numbers because Washington will throw the ball. Cousins is tied for eighth in the league in passing attempts and fifth in the league in completions. \nWhile Cousins has completed 66.2 percent of his passes (151-of-228), he also has thrown eight interceptions with just six touchdowns. He is also 33rd in average gain per completion, meaning he likes to get the ball out of his hands quickly and four of Cousins’ interceptions have come on third-and-10. That is why the team’s run game is so important. \nWhen Washington has been at its best, it has run the ball with Alfred Morris and rookie Matt Jones (Florida). Tampa Bay knows it must keep those two in check in order to get some chances at Cousins. \nMorris leads the Redskins with 297 yards, while Jones has 220 yards and three touchdowns. \n“When we’re at our best, those two guys are getting their touches and when we’re not, those guys aren’t getting enough touches,” Washington coach Jay Gruden said. “That’s important for us to establish a run game. Alfred is still the lead dog but bringing in a fresh Matt Jones, as big as he is, as physical as he is, to run with power and speed on the outside — he’s a great weapon for us.” \nThe Bucs know if they want a chance to get at Cousins they have to stop Washington from running the football. \n“Coach Frazier has always said rushing the passer has to be earned,” said defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. “We definitely have to stop the run first. \n“Morris has been their guy since he came into the league,” he said. “He’s a solid runner. You know what you’re going to get with him. Matt Jones, he comes downhill. You better bring it when he has the ball in his hands.” \nIf the Bucs can force Washington into passing downs, the Bucs gain an advantage. The Bucs have just three interceptions this year and are hoping to improve on those numbers as well. \n“I feel like we have some good players back there, some good corners and good safeties,” said cornerback Johnthan Banks. “We’ve just got to get it together. We’re going to get it this week. I hope we come out, ball and get some picks. If we’re going to get some picks, this is the game to do it.” \nNotes: Bucs’ defensive tackle Tony McDaniel (groin), tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins (shoulder) and offensive lineman Reid Fragel (concussion) are out for Sunday’s game. Linebacker Bruce Carter (thigh), left guard Logan Mankins (groin), center Evan Smith (ankle) and receiver Russell Shepard (hamstring) are questionable. Cornerback Johnthan Banks is probable. …Tampa Bay will face former teammates linebacker Mason Foster and safety Dashon Goldson today. Bucs look to corral Cousins By A.
