Will Punjab get a second booster dose of investment as it braces up for its second edition of the Progressive Punjab Investors Summit? We will find out as the events in the next week unfold. If the first summit was aimed at attracting investment, the second summit goes a step further, by highlighting the state's roadmap to offer skilled workforce to prospective investors by unveiling the skill development model of the state government. Improvisations in the industrial policy of 2013 - like a fixed tariff rate for new investors for the first five years of gestation period of the project; and an inspector-free raj (rule) for prospective investors. After all, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal has a difficult job on hand. In today's time of economic slowdown, when investors are not really keen on making any greenfield investments, Sukhbir wants to do all he can to woo new investors and ensure that those top guns in industry who pledged investments in the state in December 2013 reaffirm their commitment for investments. Industry leaders like Mukesh Ambani and Ashok Hinduja, besides representatives from Sun Pharmaceuticals, RPG group and Adani Group, have confirmed their participation in the state government's mega event to hard-sell itself as the best investment destination. World Bank ranking\nArmed with the recent top position accorded to Punjab by the World Bank in association with the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion for the best state to set up new business, the state government is now gearing up to show the progress achieved since last summit almost two years ago. Talking to The Tribune, Sukhbir, who also holds the portfolio of Investment Promotion, explains how he has turned the state's disadvantages of being a landlocked state and as an island among hill states that had been granted tax concessions for any industrial investment for ten years into advantages. \"The first phase of getting investment was to turn the disadvantageous position of the state into an advantageous position by offering fiscal incentives and a land bank. If assured power supply and exemption from electricity duty was one of the main USPs for investors in the 2013 summit, this summit will see the industrial houses coming here for the lowest industrial power tariff. For the first five years, after a new project is commissioned, we will be offering fixed power tariff of around Rs 4.9 per unit. Punjab has been criticised for its \"unemployable\" workforce. Focus on imparting skills\n\"A plan to impart skills, commensurate with the needs of industry today will be unveiled before the delegates at the summit and we have already tied up with big businesses for skill development centres. The focus of this summit will also be on projecting Punjab as one of the best destinations for medical tourism, with Medicity in New Chandigarh getting top medical institutions like Kings College, London to set shop here,\" he says. Sukhbir's optimism for wooing investors stems from the thumbs-up his new industrial policy of 2013 received and 59 of the 128 investors who signed the memorandum of understanding to invest in the state. Figures available from Invest Punjab the Bureau of Investment Promotion say that investment worth Rs 41,397 crore (of a total of Rs 67,000 crore) has been made by these investors. Forty per cent of the projects have already been commissioned. Punjab has seen maximum investment in agro and food industry (38 per cent) manufacturing sector (31 per cent), followed by solar energy and health sciences (10 per cent each). State Industry minister Madan Mohan Mittal, who has often 'reminded' the Deputy Chief Minister of the \"flight of existing industry\" from the state, too is optimistic of a turnaround in policy. \"We realise that handholding is also required for the existing industry. Consultations are on with the various industry bodies in Punjab,\" he said. Investment declining: Study\nHowever, doubts have been raised about these contentions by various quarters - not just the political opponents of the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP government, but also by premier industry body like Assocham. In a survey released three months ago, Assocham had said that new investments attracted by the state registered a fall of over 63 per cent year-on-year from over Rs 7,200 crore in 2013-14 to just about Rs 2,600 crore in 2014-15. The study titled 'Impact of Delay in Investment Implementation in Punjab' said that despite boasting of a robust infrastructure base, the state has failed to lure investors over the years evidently as the new investments attracted by the state reached its peak of Rs 36,650 crore in 2007-08. This declined to a meagre Rs 2,600 crore in 2014-15 thereby registering a fall of about 93 per cent. Incidentally, this study was rejected by the government saying that it was carried out without having any consultations with the state government and no figures on investment were ever taken from them. Even the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) and World Bank, which ranked Punjab as no. 1 in ease of setting up new business, had actually ranked the state as 16th on the ease of doing business. The state's slow labour reforms, lack of initiative in skill development and poor infrastructure in the existing industrial estates have led to a lower ranking for the state. The government realises that it has to go much beyond the fiscal incentives and creation of land banks to attract sustainable investment. How far they are able to make reforms and get things on the ground, only time will tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:06:09.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
