He was originally listed as probable to play the Lions because of that injury. The illness did not come into play until the Vikings made the announcement Saturday. \nIn 13 career games against the Lions, Peterson has rushed for 90 yards or more 10 times with 11 touchdowns. He's averaging 5.3 yards per attempt and 107 yards per game against Detroit. \nThe Vikings previously ruled defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd out of the game because of knee and ankle injuries. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:24:29.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
