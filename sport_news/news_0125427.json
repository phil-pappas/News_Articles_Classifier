He talked about Miller's hands, his impeccable work ethic, all the times that Miller volunteered to play defense on the scout team simply because he loved to practice.\n\"I told Coach Dickey that he'd end up being an unbelievable player for the University of Memphis,\" Locastro said.\nNow, more than three years later, Miller is making the most of his first real opportunity on the field. After joining the Tigers as a walk-on, redshirting as a freshman and missing all of last season with a shoulder injury, he leads the team with 304 receiving yards entering Saturday's game against No. 13 Ole Miss.\nMiller caught 15 passes in Memphis' first five games, including an 82-yard touchdown pass against Cincinnati, the Tigers' longest play of the season. He finished with five catches for 156 yards that night, then stood in a room in the bowels of Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, shaking his head.\n\"I've been waiting two years just to step on the field,\" Miller said as television cameras and tape recorders began to surround him. \"So just being able to produce and contribute like that is just a great feeling for me.\"\nMiller is the latest wide receiver at Memphis to go from walk-on to budding star. Mose Frazier, Tevin Jones, Keiwone Malone and Phil Mayhue are among those at the position who took a similar path, walking on to the team and later carving out a significant role.\nLike many of those players, coming to Memphis forced Miller to pass up other opportunities. After catching 100 passes for 1,779 yards at Christian Brothers and becoming the school's all-time leading receiver, he had several scholarship offers from Football Championship Subdivision schools waiting for him. But he believed he could play at a Football Bowl Subdivision school. Locastro did, too.\n\"(Let's) see if we can get you a preferred walk-on,\" Locastro told him. \"Then go out there and earn your way and show those guys what you can do.\"\nFrom a recruiting standpoint, the knock on Miller, who is listed at 5-feet-11, was that he wasn't tall enough to succeed at the FBS level, especially in an age where 6-foot-4 receivers have become commonplace. Locastro knew there was more to the receiver than that. He believed Miller had everything that you'd want at the position, from work ethic and route-running down to the size of Miller's hands. \"He's got tremendously big hands for a guy his size,\" said Locastro, who is now the head coach at Lausanne.\nMiller's parents, Tony and Andrea, each went to Memphis, so Miller was plenty familiar with the school. He impressed coaches with his strength at their summer camp, then shined again when they watched him play in a game during his senior season.\n\"(Wide receivers) coach (Holmon) Wiggins really, really stood on the table for him coming out of high school. Really liked him,\" coach Justin Fuente said last week. \"And we were fortunate enough to get him.\"\nMiller was the offensive scout team player of the year in 2013 and expected to start as a redshirt freshman the following season. But he injured his shoulder in the preseason, before the Tigers even started practicing in pads. He said it took six months for the injury to heal completely.\n\"I went to the (Miami Beach Bowl) but I didn't participate in it,\" Miller said after the Tigers' win over Cincinnati. \"I was actually ready to get out there then, but I wanted to preserve this season.\"\nMiller returned, and starred, in the spring, catching four passes for 54 yards and a touchdown in the team's spring game. Though he's already midway through his third season with the Tigers, he didn't catch a pass in a college game until last month: A 5-yard reception in the second quarter against Missouri State.\n\"The thing that he's continually working on is kind of refining the position, continuing to polish it up,\" Fuente said. \"It's been kind of the nuances of route-running and alignment and leverage and those sorts of things, so that the quarterback knows where he's going to be. Instead of him just getting open, it's getting open the right way, so that the quarterback knows where to throw the ball.\"\nWith that room for improvement, though, Fuente said there is also a lot of talent, and potential. Miller's career in a Memphis uniform is still relatively young, and already he has shown flashes of big-play ability. Already, he has backed up what his high-school coach told Dickey in that office several years ago.\n\"I'm not surprised whatsoever,\" Locastro said. \"He's really turned out to be exactly what I thought he'd be for Memphis.\"", "external_links": ["http://app.contenttools.co/polls/2017/embed.js?show_name=yes&show_description=yes&show_sharing_options=yes&show_cover_image=yes"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:43:18.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
