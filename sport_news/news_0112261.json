In the ninth, he hit a game-tying homer against right-hander Montreal Robertson, of the Detroit organization.\nProfar will be limited to designated-hitter appearances in the AFL, a gathering of top prospects. Hitters tend do have the upper hand in the league.\nProfar has not played the field since a spring-training game on March 22, 2014, because of a damaged muscle in the right shoulder. The Rangers have Profar on a restricted throwing program. He will continue to rehabilitate the shoulder after the AFL ends on Nov. 19 but will not move on to a winter league.\nOutfielder Lewis Brinson, ranked among the top prospects in the Rangers' player-development system, had two hits and drove in one run. Brinson has a .385 on-base percentage through six games.\nOn Twitter:\n @gfraley", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/gfraley"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:47:30.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
