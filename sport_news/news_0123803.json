Laura Morse pounded 12 kills on 20 attacks and Tyana Andrews added 10 on 17 tries as the Raiders (20-2 overall, 13-2 Cascade Conference) hit .447 as a team — their best mark since a .461 clip on Nov. 8, 2013 against Warner Pacific. The Wolves dropped to 6-14 overall and 3-12 in the CCC after their first-ever trip to Ashland. Their contrasting performance was a .083 attacking average that was not helped by nine Raider blocks. WWU only had one block of its own. Emma Gasman assisted four blocks to go with nine kills on 11 attacks (.818); and Niki Small had two solo and three assisted, dropping six kills with no errors on nine attacks. Lauren McGowne dished out 38 assists, setting the Raiders up to commit just seven attacking errors on the night. Ashlyn Flynn had a match-high 17 digs. SOU — which has won five in a row overall and 18 straight at home — hosts Oregon Tech at 7 p.m. Tuesday. Men's Soccer CARROLL 2, SOU 1: At Ashland, Carroll's Jacob Groh chipped in a point-blank shot in the 26th minute, and Jose Porras converted a penalty kick four minutes later to lead the Saints. Kirk Bassett assisted Greg Rapet's 20-yard liner that got under the cross bar for SOU's only score in the 32nd minute. The Raiders went to 10-7 overall and 5-7 in Cascade Conference play. Alessio Georgiades assisted Groh's goal for the Saints (9-5-1, 6-3-1). Women's Soccer CARROLL 3, SOU 0: At Ashland, Carroll women's soccer team got off just five shots but stuck two of them and received help from Southern Oregon on the other. Carroll's first shot was Caitlin Walter's 18-yard score after she crossed over her defender in the 38th minute. Lexi Pyette jumped on an easy rebound of Michaela Kueffler's shot to make it 2-0 in the 61st minute, and an own goal in the 81st provided the final score. The first-place Saints went to 11-4-1 overall and 8-1-1 in the Cascade Conference. SOU, which had won six of its last seven, fell to 7-8-2, and 6-4. Cross Country SOU SECOND: At Corvallis, Southern Oregon's men's team was without several top runners but managed second place at the Beaver Classic. The 8,000-meter race, hosted by the Oregon State Running Club at Avery Park, gave freshman Ryan Alexander a chance to shine with a 12th-place finish in 26 minutes, 6 seconds for the Raiders, ranked No. 1 in NAIA. The Raiders' Caleb Diaz placed 17th of 91 finishers in 26:11, Matthew Williams was 22nd (26:34) and Noah Oberitter 23rd (26:37). The Raiders' first eight finishers came in within 100 seconds of each other. SOU totaled 55 team points, second to Seattle University's 30. Clackamas Community College (66) and Northwest University (101) were next. Unattached runner Gilbert Grundy won in 25:32.
