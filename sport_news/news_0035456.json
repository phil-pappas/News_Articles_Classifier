It was the night before players could begin sending their National Letters of Intent and Warren held out hope for one more commitment. His phone rang, and the ensuing conversation caused him to tweet, “Big time commitment in the 12th hour. Nothing's official until tomorrow, can’t wait to get that fax! #tbirdnation the class is now complete.” \nAll the excitement Warren felt that night has been justified over the first six games of this season, as Josh Thornton has become a lockdown corner for the T-Birds. But while Warren didn’t have to wait long to get the fax from Thornton, he did have to practice a little more patience before seeing him in action — at least out on the field. \nThornton said the night before his first practice as a T-Bird, the junior college transfer received some disheartening news. A class he had taken to fulfill an English requirement had been cancelled and therefore, due to Allan Hancock college rules, didn’t transfer over to Southern Utah, making Thornton ineligible for the 2014 season. \nIt was just another hurdle for Thornton to jump over. \nThe speedster from Florida, was well sought after coming out of high school, holding offers from Illinois, West Virginia and Marshall. He originally committed to Illinois, but while working to academically qualify, Illinois fired head coach Ron Zook. \n“I was kind of left in a whirlwind about what to do,” Thornton said. \nHe was picked up by Western Illinois, but he said the fit just wasn’t right, so he opted to head to Allan Hancock in hopes of breaking into Division I college football, later. \n“His film came across the desk,” Warren said. “I liked his height, his competitiveness, he had a couple of plays out there, he got excited he made a play. … We just liked his attitude.” \nThat attitude was well tested last season. After finding out he would be ineligible not just to play, but also attend school, Thornton chose to remain in Cedar City and take his last Allan Hancock class online. \n“I wanted to stay close to the area,” Thornton said. “I didn’t want to get my mind to far gone. I was kind of depressed about the whole situation, so I wanted to stay tight. I had guys that took me in and helped me out a lot.” \nThornton couldn’t lift with the team, couldn’t participate in team meetings and couldn’t practice with the squad. Coaches were involved as much as they could, making sure Thornton was staying at a good weight and that he was at least getting mental reps in. \nHe roomed with a few of the redshirt players, but wasn’t getting any financial help, so to pay for his share of the rent -- and really just to live -- he took a job working at Chartwells Dining Services. \n“I catered events, set up events, broke them down, and went in after and washed dishes,” Thornton said. “It was the full experience. I was on their schedule, because I had nothing to do. So as much as they needed me to work, they were great people, so I did whatever they needed me.” \nAnd, in an odd twist, it provided an opportunity to spend more time with the team, as Chartwells catered the SUU team meals. \n\"That’s where we get our meals throughout the week,\" safety Miles Killebrew said. \"So it was cool, because he was still with us.\" \nSaid Warren, \"He was actually bringing the food out when we were eating before games. So we got to see him every week. It’s an awesome story that he was able to fight through that, earn his own money, stay out here for a semester until he got everything situated.” \nIt also allowed Thornton to see really how much he fit in with the group. Head coach Ed Lamb sells SUU as a place where you won’t just become a better football player, but a place where you will become part of a family. Even though Thornton wasn’t going out each day and lining up along side his teammates, he still felt that. \n“The team welcomed me with open arms and stayed with me, and it made it a little bit easier,” he said. “It’s an honor to be on the team. To be somewhere where you are wanted and loved.” \nThe feeling is mutual, and for SUU, Thornton's play has been well worth the wait. \nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter, @millerjryan. 67 CONNECT 29 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.thespectrum.com/story/sports/2015/10/21/suu-football-josh-thorntons-play-worth-wait/74358446/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:34:59.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
