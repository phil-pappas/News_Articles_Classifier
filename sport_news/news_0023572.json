Better, the Broncos' remaining opponents entered Saturday's play with a combined 3-15 record. \n\"We control our destiny,\" Broncos coach Lawrence Kershaw said. \"That's all you can ask for.\" \nThat's a good thing, since the winless Bears (0-6, 0-3) gave the Broncos all they could want. \nFayetteville State scored on the game's first play when the opening kickoff was mishandled by Shaw and downed in the end zone for a safety. Andre Montgomery ran for a 12-yard score, and then quarterback Derek Bryant tossed a pair of touchdown passes to stake the Broncos to a 23-7 halftime lead. \nThat lead would bulge to 30-7 when Fayetteville State scored on its first possession of the third quarter, but Shaw began to punch back. \nAs a game-long drizzle turned into a steadier rainfall, the Bears' offense began to find its flow. Freshman quarterback Terrence Shambry, making his first career start, sandwiched a pair of touchdown passes around Bryant's fourth touchdown pass to pull Shaw within 36-21. \nThe Shaw special teams unit then made up for its game-opening gaffe when Joshua Edwards tackled Broncos punter David Lamb in the end zone. Soon after, an energized Shaw defense fed off the big play and forced Bryant into his second interception of the game. \nShambry cashed in immediately with a 32-yard touchdown pass to Atravius James and the Bears were suddenly within one score with 3:36 to play. \n\"We tell our guys all the time - football games are long,\" Kershaw said. \"You're going to have momentum swings and you're going to have to be able to fight through the swings. When the momentum was swinging on us, we made the plays.\" \nFayetteville State was able to kill the clock by converting a pair of third downs. The first came on a defensive pass interference penalty and the final conversion came courtesy of a tumbling reception by Maleek Gorham. \n\"It was a tough football game,\" Bryant said. \"Rainy, kind of sloppy with penalties, but one thing about our coaches is, they say 'next play, next play,' especially at the end. \n\"When (Shaw) got the momentum, my quarterbacks coach (Calvin) Randall got me on the headset and said, 'Next play. Take one play to get this one in the bag,'\" Bryant continued. \"We did a good job on the sideline staying together as a family and just fighting this one out.\" \nBryant completed 29 of 45 passes for 262 yards. Chris Hubert was his favorite target, hauling in 10 passes for 73 yards and a touchdown. Eight different Broncos caught passes. Montgomery rushed for 85 yards on 16 carries. \nShaw had lost by an average margin of 17.8 points entering Saturday's contest and averaged just 201 total yards per game. Shambry alone provided 215 yards on 19 of 33 passing as the Bears mustered 285 total yards against the Broncos. \n\"You're never happy about a loss, but we never stopped playing and that's a plus there,\" Shaw coach Robert Massey said. \"I think the guys who played today, they showed something. We're going to take those guys and we're going to make the best of it.\" \nBryant said Fayetteville State also plans to make the best of things, first by celebrating this most recent victory. \n\"It feels incredible to be 3-0 (in conference play),\" he said. \"This conference is tough. Winning games is tough and we just feel good where we're at, so we'll probably enjoy this one for tonight, but come Monday, we'll move on.\" \nFayetteville State 36, Shaw 29 \nShaw", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:59:35.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
