(AP) - A ceremony is being held to mark the 10th anniversary of the capsizing of an Adirondack cruise boat that killed 20 tourists from the Midwest.\nThe Ethan Allen was taking 48 mostly elderly passengers from Michigan on a tour of Lake George when it tipped over and sank on Oct. 2, 2005, off the western shore a few miles north of the village of Lake George.\nThe boat's captain and 27 passengers survived, but 20 other passengers died. They were among a group of retirees taking a fall foliage tour of the Northeast.\nOfficials later determined the vessel was overloaded because standards for the weight of passengers were outdated and changes made to the boat had affected its stability.\nA memorial service is being held at 12:30 p.m. Friday at the village monument dedicated to the Ethan Allen victims.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
