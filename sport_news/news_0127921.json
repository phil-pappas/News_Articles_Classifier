It was just after 11 p.m., and no one was wearing a seat belt.\nRich said Reed was traveling in excess of 80 mph in a section of the road designated for a 40 mph speed limit.\nShe had three passengers: all of them high school basketball players.\n\"She was illegally passing and went to make a corrective action,\" said Rich.\nThat's when the 2007 Scion driven by Reed struck a tree head-on.\nThe two students who lost their lives were well-loved Citronelle High School basketball players Sedrick \"Redbird\" James and Wylan Lang.\nA candlelight vigil was held to remember the players and grief counselors were on hand for weeks.\nReed was booked Monday morning and remains in jail.\nReed claims to go to the University of Alabama on social media; her name could not be found in a UA student directory for the present year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:27:10.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
