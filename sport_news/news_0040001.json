Dickey prior to Game 3 in Arlington on Sunday. “We know we have a good baseball team and guys are still cutting up and, you know, Kawasaki was dancing on the bus after we lost the first two games on the way to our hotel, and it was hilarious.\n“That’s just the kind team we have, and that’s why we don’t want it to end, because it’s really special and you know when you have something special, you don’t want it to end.”\nThey made good on that desire Sunday and Monday in Arlington, with a pair of convincing victories that featured their old offensive swagger. They left Texas with a loose, “bring it on” outlook for the deciding game.\nRegular-season success can be a false idol, the sort of red herring that tricks teams into believing the correlation with October triumph is stronger than it really is. In the postseason, it takes so little to unravel. Look around at baseball’s other series. The Dodgers and the Cardinals, the National League’s two best division winners over 162 games, were both on the ropes heading to Game 4 on the road, down 2-1. In the regular season those three games would represent less than two percent of the season’s entirety. Four days into the playoffs, they were both two-thirds of the way to a ticket home with nothing to show but a sad little pennant to fly above their stadiums.\nFor some teams, there is a postseason learning curve that needs to be experienced. We will soon find out if the veteran-laden Jays have fully absorbed those lessons.\nOne of those lessons is to learn how to roll with the anarchy that erupts in the playoffs.\nOver the course of the season, baseball has its ordered rhythms. In October, not so much.\nCrazy stuff happens. A guy like Dickey, pitching a perfectly decent game Monday, leading 7-1, looks over his shoulder in the bottom of the fifth inning and here comes David Price, the staff’s ace starter, trotting out of the bullpen.\n“Probably not a relationship-building move,” said manager John Gibbons, wryly.\nIn that moment, there was a confluence of factors that motivated Gibbons.\nYes, Dickey had pitched well but the next two hitters, Shin-Soo Choo (lefthanded) and Adrian Beltre, had gone 4-for-4 in their first two at-bats.\nYes, the score was 7-1 but the game was early enough that even if the Rangers got one or two runs in the inning, suddenly they were within reach of the lead.\nYes, Price was the only lefthander in his bullpen and was in full agreement to being used in relief. Aaron Loup was unavailable, having left to attend to a family crisis. Brett Cecil had been injured in Game 2 in Toronto and is gone for the season.\nAnd yes, because it was a possible elimination game for Toronto, Gibbons could not dare think beyond the moment.\nHe knew he had Marcus Stroman in reserve to pitch Wednesday if necessary. He knew Marco Estrada would be on regular rest to start Friday if the team was to get to the next series. And, he knew that no matter how deep into the game Price went on Monday, he would still be fresh for a start in the ALCS Game 2 on Saturday.\nDickey has talked a lot about the unselfish approach this team took to the AL East title. Monday night, he lived those words, acknowledging that it hurt to be lifted but insisting he was thrilled with the outcome. That is the essence of being a great teammate. If he has issues, they will be addressed in an appropriate time and place.\nThe baseball playoffs thrive on this chaos, on reducing a long season to a complete crapshoot. It makes for gonzo games, for increased scrutiny, for memorable stories, not the least of which is Stroman’s startling impact on a season that most people felt was completely lost when he tore up his knee in a freak spring training accident.\nOr the emergence of Kevin Pillar as a bona fide star, both offensively and defensively. On Monday, he had three hits, including his first career postseason home run and drove in three runs. He has been a human highlight reel on defence throughout this season.\n“I was able to get to the big leagues because I could hit,” said Pillar. “Nobody really talked about my defence and then I came up here and struggled a little bit my first two years. Going out there and being able to make plays in the outfield kind of became my calling card. To some degree my offensive performance got overshadowed but I’m a guy who just wants to go out there and win. If I have to do it with the bat or the glove, whatever it takes, I’ll do it.”\nWinning is all that Wednesday night is about. At the end, one clubhouse will be soaked, the other sombre.\nMLB PLAYOFFS\nCan Jays overcome postseason learning curve in time?\nBy Ken Fidlin , Toronto Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 12:15 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 03:11 PM EDT\nFor more than two months, the Blue Jays — and especially their fans — forgot what the crushing solemnity of losing felt like.\nOh, they lost games during that epic 60-some game run down the stretch, but these were merely pebbles on the road to glory, shrugged off in a matter of moments.
