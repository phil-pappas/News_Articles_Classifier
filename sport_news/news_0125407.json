Division Street early Sept. 6.\nPortland police already have arrested Joshua Aaron Bigsby, 28, and Kayla Elizabeth Elmer, 24, in connection with the fire.\nAccording to court documents, investigators believe Smith and Williams were with Elmer and Bigsby when Bigsby left the apartment complex, paid about $2.50 to fill up a gas can at a local AM/PM and then returned to the apartment, poured the gas onto a second-floor landing and ignited it with a lighter.\nInvestigators reviewed surveillance video, which showed two women jogging back toward a parked car after the fire was set about 4:23 a.m.\nBigsby, Elmer, Williams and Smith had been socializing with a couple earlier in the evening at a strip club called Spearmint Rhino. The couple invited them back to their apartment on Division Street. At the apartment, Elmer wanted to buy $40 worth of cocaine from one of the apartment occupants, the arrest warrant affidavit said.\nThe drug deal led to a fight. Williams told Elmer that the cocaine didn't amount to $40 worth, so Williams and Elmer insisted they get their money back, according to the affidavit.\nThey left the apartment because of the fight, but returned with a gas can, investigators contend in the affidavit. Bigsby returned to the apartment, with Elmer and Williams, while Smith remained in the car. After the fire was set, they all drove to Bigsby's house, the affidavit said.\nOne occupant of the apartment, Michael Alston Jr., sustained burns to his forearms, hands, chest and back, according to court records. At least two others were burned but chose not to seek immediate medical attention.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-15T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:18:31.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
