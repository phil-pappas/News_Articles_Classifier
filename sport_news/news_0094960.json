But according to coach Tim Duryea, it is precautionary and Collette has been able to participate \"full speed\" during the first week of practice.\nCollette and the Aggies make their first public appearance of the season Thursday during Utah State's Prime Time Madness event at the Spectrum. The men's and women's teams will scrimmage and compete in skill competitions starting at 7 p.m.\nLast season, the Utah State men finished 18-13 overall and 11-7 in the Mountain West Conference.\n  The Aggies return all five starters, including Collette. A sophomore out of Murray High School, he averaged 12.8 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocked shots last year. His 56 blocks were the most by a freshman in Utah State history.\nDuryea called Collette's recent ankle sprain \"severe\" — one that also resulted in tightness in his Achilles and a \"hot spot\" on the outside of his foot, probably because he started compensating for his sore ankle.\nX-rays and MRIs have not indicated any unexpected damage, however, and Duryea expects Collette to be 100 percent when the Aggies open their season Oct. 31 with an exhibition game against Panhandle State.\n\"We haven't been told anything that makes us think otherwise,\" Duryea said. \"Nobody has recommended any kind of surgery, or anything like that.\"\nThat's good news for Duryea, who's starting his first season as Utah State's head coach after a 14-year run as an assistant on Stew Morrill's staff. Morrill retired after last season.\nAsked how this preseason is different than previous years, Duryea laughed and said, \"Well, I don't use the alarm any more. I pretty much wake up on my own now. But I guess that goes with the territory.\"\nHe continued: \"You look at everything, instead of just your area. You are in a planning frame of mind — an organization frame of mind. In the meantime, with everything that goes on, you can't forget to coach the team. I tell myself that all the time: 'Don't forget where the focus needs to be.' \"\nDuryea characterized the Aggies' first week of practice as \"great. … Obviously we have a lot of veteran players. They know what to expect and they carry the day. Their attitude, work ethic and desire are very evident.\"What will fans see if they attend Prime Time Madness?\n\"We hope to show that we have an exciting, skilled group,\" Duryea said. \"By nature, a good offensive group — a good shooting group — is fun to watch. And this is a veteran, unselfish group. I think we're a group that people will want to cheer for.\"\n\nluhm@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @sluhm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:08:15.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
