(AP) - Tennessee Chancellor Jimmy Cheek says he is \"very confident\" there was \"no inappropriate conduct\" between Volunteers coach Butch Jones and a player. \nWhile speaking Thursday to the Board of Trustees, Cheek said there were rumors and misinformation about \"an alleged incident during football practice.\" The chancellor said he and athletic director Dave Hart have \"done our due diligence\" on this matter. \nCheek was responding to message board discussions and reports that Jones had a \"physical altercation\" with center Mack Crowder during a preseason practice. Jones said the allegation was \"absolutely ridiculous.\" \nCrowder tweeted that he's \"honored to be a part of this University and Vol FAMILY\" and wanted \"nothing more than for Vol nation to come together.\" \nTennessee (2-3, 0-2 SEC) hosts No. 19 Georgia (4-1, 1-1) on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:20:54.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
