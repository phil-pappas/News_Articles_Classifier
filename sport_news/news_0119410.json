(AP Photo/Peter Morrison) more > By   \nDUBLIN (AP) - Substitute Shane Long scored five minutes after coming on for Ireland to upset world champion Germany 1-0 and clinch at least a playoff place for Euro 2016 on Thursday. \nLong struck in the 70th minute of their qualifier when he took goalkeeper Darren Randolph’s long kick over the German defense and fired the ball past Manuel Neuer to the top corner. \n“He’s one of the best goalkeepers in the world so it makes it even that bit more special,” Long said after Ireland’s first ever competitive win over Germany. \n“It was an unexpected and unnecessary defeat,” Germany coach Joachim Loew said. \n“He’s won a World Cup, he’s entitled to his opinion, and we were brilliant,” Irish counterpart Martin O’Neill said. \nWith one game in qualifying remaining, Germany tops Group D on 19 points, one ahead of Poland and Ireland, which meet in Warsaw on Sunday. \nRobert Lewandowski scored his second goal deep in injury time for Poland to draw 2-2 with Scotland in Glasgow and end the home side’s hopes of a playoff. \nBecause of its superior goal difference, a draw on Sunday would be enough for Poland to qualify directly, while Ireland needs to win to avoid the playoffs. \nGermany hosts already eliminated Georgia in Leipzig on Sunday, when a draw would be enough for Loew’s side. \nEarlier Thursday, Georgia defeated Gibraltar 4-0 in Tbilisi. Both sides’ qualification hopes were already over. \nGermany dominated from the off in Dublin with the home side living off scraps going forward. \nJerome Boateng headed over in the ninth, and only a desperate block from Irish defender John O’Shea prevented Ilkay Gundogan scoring four minutes later. \nRichard Keogh cut out Matthias Ginter’s cross for the waiting Mario Goetze, who later went off with a groin injury that rules him out against Georgia. \nMesut Ozil thought he’d scored in the 19th but the goal was offside. \nJon Walters forced Neuer into action for the first time in the 24th. The Germany ‘keeper had otherwise little to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:59:46.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
