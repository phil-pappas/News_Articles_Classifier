At some point in the afternoon, the men's basketball team's sophomore guard got up from his seat. He wandered over to the Byrd Stadium concourse. \nIt was as if Justin Bieber had arrived. There were fans and photo... (Jonas Shaffer) \nAside from senior forward Jake Layman, who played on the same under-18 national team the summer before their freshman year, Sulaimon didn't know any of his new teammates. But in the two months since he arrived, Sulaimon says, \"Our chemistry off the court is already great.\" \n\"We're working on the chemistry on the court. That's going to be a day-by-day process,\" he said. \"The thing I've been impressed with is that nobody has egos, everyone wants to play for the name on the front of the jersey. That's really all Coach can ask for.\" \nTurgeon said Tuesday that he is counting on Sulaimon to join Layman and junior forward Robert Carter Jr., who sat out last season after transferring from Georgia Tech, to fill the leadership void left by the graduation of All-Big Ten guard Dez Wells. \n\"Sulaimon is a guy that's a natural competitor and kind of gets it,\" Turgeon said. \"In between the lines, he's doing a lot of leading, lot of talking â€” he's really good at it. Off the floor, out of respect to Jake and Robert, they've been here longer so he's letting them do a little bit more.\" \nSaid Sulaimon: \"It was kind of a shock to me because I've never been in a leadership role. I'm coming into their locker room. I'm the new guy on the block, so to speak. Last year they had a tremendous year without me. As time goes on my voice will probably get louder.\" \nSulaimon might have filled that role at Duke, but when his playing time and production diminished as his relationship with Krzyzewski deteriorated last season, so did the opportunity to be a leader. He was surprised to see the way his new teammates responded to him, especially considering where he played before. \n\"It says a lot about these guys,\" he said. \"They set a school record last year for [26 regular-season] wins, played in a new conference and [were] very successful. To have a new guy come in, especially from Duke or wherever like that, and to embrace me the way they did, I feel like I'm a blessed individual to land in such a great spot. \n\"I think it's going to be a great partnership and I'm excited.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:22:07.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
