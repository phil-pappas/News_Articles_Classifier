And so, had a tough game the week before. Baylor got after us, and so now let's worry about us and try to get things going for these last seven.\"\nOn the health of Patrick Mahomes:\n\"He's getting treatment every day, and he told me he feels a lot better today. So hopefully by this week he can be 100 percent.\"\nOn Le'Raven Clark's performance against Shawn Oakman:\n\"I think just two good players going at it. I think Oakman had a couple of plays. They did a good job of moving him around, moved him inside a couple of times. But just two good players going at it and I felt Le'Raven handled himself well.\"\nOn Iowa State:\n\"I think they're a much improved team. Played Toledo -- who is a top 25 team -- very close in overtime and really had a great game against Kansas last week. So much better than last year. I think defensively they've done some things schematically that'll help them out - they're turning people over, and then offense, anytime you have a senior quarterback that's played a lot, that's going to give you problems. He can run well; he throws well, so it'll be a good challenge for us.\"\nOn Justin Murphy's status:\n\"He'll be out this week.\"\nOn possible replacements:\n\"We'll just create competition in that position. Rob Castaneda is a guy that comes to mind that needs to step up, Emeka Okafor. We'll have them with Tony [Morales] get some reps and see who the best guy is and he'll start on Saturday.\"\nWASHINGTON\nOn Iowa State's defense:\n\"They're better from last year, you know it's Homecoming, so I'm sure coach Rhoads and the gang will definitely be coming in and try to sabotage that. I think we just got to get back to our game plan: Play our ball, and everything should take care of itself.\"\nOn opportunity to pass Baron Batch on Texas Tech's all-time rushers list:\n\"I mean it would be nice. It would be huge, especially being a running back at Texas Tech. But just want to get this win first.\"\nAWE\nOn helping younger players correct mistakes:\n\"I mean the main thing, [Branden Jackson] and Pete Robertson, they are doing a great job of being vocal leaders out there. But sometimes you just got to calm down and go back to your basics. I mean sometimes, or a lot of times if you try harder, you're going to make more mistakes. It's not about trying harder, especially on defense. I think a lot of people don't understand, going against these offenses in college nowadays, the worst thing you can do sometimes is try harder.\"\nOn finding ways to improve on defense:\n\"We just got to calm down and regroup each and every play, whether the last play was a good play or a bad play. We just got to regroup and continue to move on and be consistent because defense, I mean that's what defense is - is consistency. The best defenses are consistent. They don't stop everyone, but they're most consistent and that's what we need to get to.\"\nFollow Mike DuPont on Twitter: @MikeDuPont_\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:40:04.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
