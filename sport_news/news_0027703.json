Comment By Mark Daniels and Tim Britton/@MarkDanielsPJ and @TimBritton MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA By Mark Daniels and Tim Britton/@MarkDanielsPJ and @TimBritton Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 7:37 PM Updated at 7:40 PM By Mark Daniels and Tim Britton/@MarkDanielsPJ and @TimBritton Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 7:37 PM Updated at 7:40 PM FOXBORO — Tarell Brown missed his second consecutive practice on Friday with a foot injury and has been ruled out of this weekend's game against the Indianapolis Colts. According to the NFL Network, Brown could be out for longer than this week as his foot injury is considered “potentially serious” and he’s seeking a second opinion. Brown suffered a broken foot last year in Week 15 when he was with the Oakland Raiders. Despite this he came out of training camp as the Patriots' second-best cornerback behind Malcolm Butler . Brown started the first two games of the season against Pittsburgh and Buffalo. He didn’t play against Jacksonville, but made seven tackles last week against the Cowboys, primarily working in the slot against Cole Beasley . He played 62 percent of the defensive snaps. The Patriots depth at cornerback isn’t great. With Brown out, the Patriots will continue to rely on Butler and Logan Ryan , who has started the past two games on the outside. Ryan has the ability to move into the slot. That's where he played against Jacksonville, when Brown was out. In that game, Justin Coleman played on the outside, opposite of Butler. The Patriots also signed cornerback Rashaan Melvin this week. If Brown’s injury makes it so he can't play this season, the Patriots will have to look at veteran trade targets to add more depth. Almost full attendance Brown was the only player to miss Friday's practice. Lewis was present after popping up on the practice report Thursday with an abdomen injury. The running back was limited again on Friday, but listed as questionable on the injury report. Dont'a Hightower (ribs) and Trey Flowers (knee/shoulder) were also limited and ruled as questionable for Sunday night. The Colts also listed three players as questionable: quarterback Andrew Luck (shoulder), and linebackers Jerrell Freeman (groin) and Nate Irving (knee). Praise for dedicated Solder A day after the Patriots officially placed left tackle Nate Solder on injured reserve, ending his season, head coach Bill Belichick called Solder's injury \"a tough break.\" \"It’s too bad,\" Belichick said. \"Nate works really hard in the offseason, is one of our offseason award guys. I think his work ethic and his training and all that is as good as it can be. It’s just unfortunate. It wasn’t really that big of a hit or anything. It was just one of those things.\" Even though Solder is the keystone to that offensive line at left tackle, the Patriots, compared to most NFL teams, are unusually well-equipped to handle his loss, thanks to their in-game substitution patterns. Marcus Cannon has seen plenty of time on the left side of the line, and New England could opt to slide Sebastian Vollmer over from right tackle.
