People have to get used to this. \n\"Some people seem to think football is like theatre, and that everyone has to play the good guy. \n\"But I think that you transform when you cross the white line, you're not the same person as off it. \n\"I give no quarter and I ask for none. Out there I'm going to fight for my team and do the best I can. \n\"I'm not going to change that because of what people may think of it. \n\"Afterwards, when the match is over, I have my family and my friends. I have fun like a normal person.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:14:01.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
