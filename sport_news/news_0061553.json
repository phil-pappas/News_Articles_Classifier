She can change a game. She's had 31 goals on the season and she's just a playmaker. So that's definitely a loss. With Ashleigh, we've had to take a midfielder, Brooke Riefenstahl, whose done a very nice job, but we've had to move her back, which has taken away a little bit of what we were able to do with our depth and the subbing that we were able to do earlier. We're not quite able to do that at this point.\" \nThe Tigers were able to control possession much of the game on Tuesday night, especially in the first half. They limited the Panthers, who didn't lose a league game in the regular season, to six shots. \n\"I'm still disappointed. I wish we could have created more opportunities,\" Ochse said. \"I think the girls played with heart. They never gave up. We'd have a couple nice passes but we were missing that final pass that would lead to a quality shot. So that's something we're going to have work on before districts start.\" \nAnd that's where the Panthers have to turn their focus as they will look to rebound from their first loss since the season opener. \n\"Life is full of losses and this is just an example of us having to overcome and we will,\" Ochse said. \"We'll give them the day off tomorrow and we'll regroup on Thursday and start focusing on a bigger tournament with maybe some new opponents. The loss sucks but we don't want the season to end and I think that will be motivation enough for them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:02:36.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
