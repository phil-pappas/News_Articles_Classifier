Conference teams beat each other up and then seem to falter in bowl season. There always seems to be one team that spoils the season for the Big 12's best shot at the BCS/College Football Playoff.\nLast year West Virginia played that role defeating Baylor in Morgantown. Now the season is at a point where two ranked Big 12 teams with lofty playoff expectations collide in the first quarter of the season.\nLogic says that since both teams are ranked, a loss may not be as big a factor when determining the final four teams at the end of the year. Maybe it won't matter at all since the two teams are meeting so early on in the season. But, logic was thrown out the window when TCU slid out of the final four teams and the Big 12 was left out of the inaugural playoff.\nBottom line for both of these teams: a win will erase all of those potential headaches.\nWhen Oklahoma has the ball\nThe Sooners' offense versus the Mountaineers' defense is going to be the more entertaining of the two matchups in this game. Bob Stoops and his coaching staff are going to have a decision to make about how to attack the 3-3-5 defense.\nDoes the team ride Baker Mayfield's hot hand and sling the ball around against one of the most talented secondaries in all of college football? Or does Oklahoma use last year's game plan that saw Samaje Perine run rampant over the West Virginia defense for 242 yards and four touchdowns? Willing to be that there's a combination of both.\nEither way, this should be one of the marquee offense versus defense matchups in the Big 12 this year.\nWhen West Virginia has the ball\nCan the Sooners contain Shelton Gibson? He's looking like a Tavon Auston-Stedman Bailey clone this season. He has 12 catches for 329 yards, which is good for an average of 27.4 yards per catch (!). The Mountaineers actually have five players (including Gibson) who average double-digit yards per catch. Jovon Durante and Daikel Shorts both have 16.6 yards per catch on 12 and 10 receptions.\nWhen quarterback Skyler Howard isn't throwing the ball deep, Wendell Smallwood is racking up the rushing yards with a 6.9 yards per carry average. The Mountaineers haven't turned the ball over much this year (just two total) and they are lethal in both the passing and rushing game.\nOklahoma's defense is going to have its work cut out for it.\nPrediction\nSome high scoring games are decided by who has the football last. In order for that to happen, teams need to maximize scoring chances on drives. And to do that, teams need to take care of the football.\nWest Virginia has the best turnover margin of any Big 12 team at plus-nine. Oklahoma is last at minus-four. The Mountaineers have also been exceptionally good on defense in the red zone. Giving up three points may hurt every now and then, but it hurts a lot less than giving up six. And, recently, West Virginia has been shutting down its opponents in the red zone .\nKeep an eye on the Mayfield-Karl Joseph matchup as well. Should be interesting to see how Joseph handles defending Mayfield's ability to throw and his ability to scramble.\nScore: West Virginia 34 Oklahoma 31\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/30/five-things-oklahoma-fans-need-know-west-virginia-including-hard-hitting-karl-joseph"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:48:40.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
