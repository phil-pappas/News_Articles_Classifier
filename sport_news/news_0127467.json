The pact doesn't include a player or team option and the contract is reportedly fully guaranteed.\nTo make room on the roster, the Cavs waived camp invite Nick Minnerath .\nThompson, the fourth-overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, played in all 82 games during the 2014-15 regular season, averaging 8.5 points on a career-best 54 percent shooting from the field. He also averaged 8.0 rebounds in 26.8 minutes.\nKnown for his hustle, relentless effort on the boards and durability, Thompson's 82 games played in the regular season extended his consecutive games streak to 288 dating back to Feb. 10, 2012. It's the second-longest active streak, trailing Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, who has played in 322 straight.\nThompson, who spent much of the year trying to stabilize Cleveland's shaky second unit, finished fifth in Sixth Man of the Year voting. He had 14 double-doubles in the regular season, with eight coming off the bench. That number tied him for the NBA lead among second unit players. He also led all NBA bench players in total rebounds (511) and offensive rebounds per game (3.2), while ranking second in total rebounds per game (7.6).\nThompson's role grew during the playoffs, starting 15 of the 20 games, all of which came after Kevin Love's season-ending shoulder injury. During Cleveland's run to the Finals, Thompson averaged 9.6 points on nearly 56 percent shooting to go with 10.8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 36.4 minutes. He registered nine double-doubles and secured double-digit rebounds in 14 of the 20 postseason contests, constantly frustrating opponents with his knack for creating second-chance opportunities and keeping possessions alive.\nThompson, 24, was one of six free agents the Cavaliers hoped to re-sign during a busy off-season. He was the final one, electing to hold out for a bigger deal. But days before the regular season opener, the nucleus of the team is back. The group that won the Eastern Conference and came within to wins of an NBA title is ready for its next quest.\n\"We're just happy that Tristan is back because we all know, everyone knows what he means to us,\" James Jones said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:29:59.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
