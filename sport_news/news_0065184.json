The senior gave the freshman a well-earned hug.\nâHe deserves it,â Kessler said moments later. âThose picks â\" that won us the game tonight.â\nThey might have saved the Trojansâ season, such as it is.\nAt 4-3 overall, USC is out of the running for the College Football Playoff. But at 2-2 in the conference â\" with wins over Utah and Arizona State â\" the Trojans remain alive for the Pac-12 South title.\nConsidering all theyâve been through â\" a midseason coaching change, three losses in four games and an injury list thatâs growing by the week â\" thatâs something.\nâItâs been tough,â Kessler said. âThese guys have been pushed to the limit. Thank God for this guy.â\nKessler was referring to interim coach Clay Helton, who has preached positivity and togetherness since taking over for the fired Steve Sarkisian earlier this month. Helton deferred the credit.\nâI want to thank these players,â Helton said. âUnbelievable resiliency these guys have. They amaze me as a coach.â\nAlthough USC was favored over Utah (6-1, 3-1), the Trojans did not enter Saturday with momentum on their side. Not only had they lost two games in a row, but they had lost their last two games at home.\nUSC seemed to be headed down that same dark alley when Utah took a 14-7 lead late in the first quarter. But early in the second, the tenor of the game â\" and the season â\" changed.\nOn third-and-3 from the Utah 42-yard line, Smith stepped into the path of Travis Wilsonâs pass intended for tailback Devontae Booker.\nâWe needed a spark,â Helton said, âand he gave it to us.â\nSmith returned the ball 41 yards to the Utesâ 4. Four plays later, fullback Soma Vainuku dove over the goal line to tie the score at 14.\nAfter Ronald Jones IIâs 18-yard touchdown run gave USC a 21-14 lead, Utah got the ball back with 3:31 left in the first half. The Utes advanced from their 11 to the Trojansâ 45 and faced fourth-and-2 with 1:20 remaining.\n1 2 Next Page Related: Miller: Utah-USC result shows oddsmakers know a lot more than pollsters USC Notes: Toa Lobendahn is latest offensive lineman to get hurt USC-Utah box score", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/first-689078-usc-utah.html", "http://sports.ocregister.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510240062&home=62&vis=94&final=true", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/usc-689082-smith-one.html"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:33:31.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
