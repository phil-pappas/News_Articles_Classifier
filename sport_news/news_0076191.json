He sustained an arm injury in the Utah State game. \nVallejo and Yakoo are questionable for next week’s game at UNLV, coach Bryan Harsin said. Vallejo has been hampered for weeks, he said. Frazier is expected to miss the UNLV game. \nSophomore Joe Martarano of Fruitland replaced Vallejo — his second career start. Martarano made six tackles. \nYakoo’s absence forced the Broncos to play sophomore Archie Lewis at right tackle. Lewis struggled in the first two games of the year, which prompted coaches to move Yakoo from left guard to right tackle. \nTRUE FRESHMAN STARTS \nBoise State true freshman cornerback Tyler Horton made his first career start in place of senior Donte Deayon, who will miss about three games with a knee injury. Junior college transfer Raymond Ford also played. \nDefense’s shutout streak ends \nWyoming scored an offensive touchdown with 57 seconds left in the first half — the first time an opposing offense reached the end zone in Boise since Fresno State in the 2014 Mountain West championship game. \nThose touchdowns were scored 214 minutes, 34 seconds apart by game time. Washington (scored 13 points, including a punt return for a touchdown), Idaho State (shutout) and Hawaii (shutout) failed to reach the end zone on offense this season. \nThe Broncos also hadn’t allowed a point at home in 136 minutes, 32 seconds. \nUTAH STATE LOSS HELPS BRONCOS IN DIVISION \nSan Diego State crushed Utah State 48-14 on Friday in San Diego — a huge boost to Boise State’s conference-title hopes. \nUtah State fell to 3-1 in the Mountain West. The Aggies still must lose one more time for the Broncos to be able to win the Mountain Division. The Aggies’ remaining games: vs. Wyoming, at New Mexico, at Air Force and vs. Nevada. The Aggies are 1-3 on the road this season. \nBoise State is 2-1 in conference play going into Saturday’s game against Wyoming. San Diego State is 4-0 and holds a two-game lead in the West Division. \nQUICK HITS \nRight guard Steven Baggett and tailback/special-teamer Ryan Wolpin were the single-game captains. ... Senior DT Armand Nance carried the Hammer. ... Wyoming won the coin toss and deferred. ... Former Boise State offensive linemen Matt Paradis (Denver Broncos) and Charles Leno Jr. (Chicago Bears) served as honorary captains. ... The attendance was a season-low 31,946.
