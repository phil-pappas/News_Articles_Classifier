But I have not made up my mind as yet. I have not taken a final decision. I will review it all after the series against England,\" the 41-year-old, who has led Pakistan since late 2010 after the spot fixing scandal in England, told the media on Friday.\nMisbah will lead Pakistan in a tough three test series against Ashes winners England in the UAE from 13 October where he has achieved his most memorable victories and individual performances. Last year he equalled the world record for fastest test century against Australia in the UAE. \"I would like to ensure that my last Test innings whenever it comes is a memorable one for Pakistan. I would like to go out on a high note,\" said the right hander.\nEarlier in an interview on a television channel Misbah indicated he might accept the challenge of leading Pakistan on the tour of England next summer. He said his focus was right now on the coming series in the UAE but he remained fit and in form and if he continued doing well and the team performed well the tour to England was not far off and was a big challenge as a captain and batsman.\nMisbah said on Friday that England would not find the conditions in UAE easy but admitted that his team would feel the absence of champion off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, who took around 23 wickets the last time Pakistan routed England 3-0 in the UAE in 2012.\n\"Saeed's absence will be felt but the good thing is that Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar have done well since the onus of leading the spin attack fell on them last year. They bowled brilliantly against Australia and New Zealand and we hoping for a similar performance from them against England.\" Misbah said that Pakistan just needed to focus on its own performance instead of worrying about England's strengths and weaknesses.\n\"We just have to play the same way we have done in recent series against Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. We are going to play and think positively,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:04:50.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
