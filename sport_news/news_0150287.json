He will look across the line of scrimmage and see the familiar gold helmets of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and wonder what could have been. \nThe freshman offensive lineman out of Tampa (FL) Plant grew up in a family that pulled for Notre Dame, and even though his dad John played at Alabama, Jake also pulled for the Irish and dreamed of playing there. \nSaturday he will play against them. \n“It’s everything. I grew up a big Notre Dame fan as a kid, and this will be a big game for me,” Fruhmorgen told the media earlier this week. “It's one of those games that you circle on your calendar when I came to Clemson. My grandpa loved Notre Dame when I was a kid. My step-grandma went to Notre Dame. I'm Catholic, so it's a lot of that, too. It was a big school for me as a kid.” \nFruhmorgen’s grandfather played quarterback in the Marine Corps and in college and wore No. 63 – which is why he wears the number today – and married an ex-nun that became Jake’s step-grandmother. Jake’s grandfather was a big Notre Dame fan his entire life, and his step-grandmother continues to wear some kind of Irish attire even when she watches Jake play. \nJake went to camp at Notre Dame but didn’t receive an offer, and once the offer came it was too late for the Irish to make inroads. \n“They didn't recruit me too hard when I was getting a lot of my offers, and I kind of got mad about that,” Fruhmorgen said. “I was a little bitter, but they offered me later on. I wasn't interested anymore, really. Maybe I was a little immature, and I didn't understand why they didn't offer me, but it (the game) will be big for me.” \nIt was a visit from current offensive coordinator Tony Elliott Tony Elliott Co-OC / Running Backs View Full Profile that gave Clemson an edge over the competition. \n“I didn't really know too much about Clemson,” Fruhmorgen said. “They were my third offer, and I remember Coach Elliott came to see me in person. When they did that, it was kind of special to me. My perception as a kid was just that they were an average, good program, but never could reach the top.” \nFruhmorgen wound up feeling at home at Clemson, and as a result, didn’t take any official visits to Notre Dame for a game. Or anywhere else. \n“I've really only been to two college football games in my whole life,” he said. “I went to a Florida game and then Clemson. I went to the South Carolina game last year, and we were winning the game the whole time, so it wasn't anything crazy.” \nFruhmorgen is currently listed as the second-team right tackle, and was rushed out onto the field early in the win over Louisville. However, he was injured on his third play and is just now getting back to normal. \n“Today (Tuesday) I'll be full go. Yesterday I was running around getting back used to running,” he said. “It was the third play when I got in, and I got twisted up and thrown into a pile and landed on my knee. I got hurt there, and it just got stiff after that. I was telling myself that I just missed my chance. I was going in the game and probably going to play the rest of the game and show that I can do this. Things happen for a reason. I'm not mad about it. I just wish it didn't happen like that.” \nNow that he’s healthy, he is preparing to start in case Joe Gore Joe Gore", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:19:00.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
