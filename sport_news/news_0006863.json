It came after Eric Lins' 80-yard touchdown scamper had put the North Stars (3-1, 0-1) ahead 41-35.\n\"We kept getting closer and closer throughout the game, and I ended up getting through on the last one,\" Bellano said. \"When it happened, I knew it would help out somehow, but didn't know how much.\"\nBesides Chambers and workhorse running back Justin Taormina, the Vikings also benefited from a 57-yard first-quarter fumble recovery touchdown by defensive tackle Nicholas Schmook and interceptions from Bellano and Alec Keating.\nSchmook's score put Geneva (4-0, 2-0) ahead 14-0, but the North Stars' two quick touchdowns forged a 14-14 tie. The game's next six touchdowns alternated between Geneva's scores and St. Charles North's equalizers.\nPrep football: Marian Central shocks No. 11 Nazareth Mike Helfgot A 19-point halftime lead, a 17-game winning streak and a pair of Division I playmakers gave Nazareth every reason to believe it was on its way to another lopsided victory.\nThe improbable comeback Emitt Peisert engineered might have been the upset of the year.\nPeisert rushed for 306 yards and four...\nA 19-point halftime lead, a 17-game winning streak and a pair of Division I playmakers gave Nazareth every reason to believe it was on its way to another lopsided victory.\nThe improbable comeback Emitt Peisert engineered might have been the upset of the year.\nPeisert rushed for 306 yards and four...\n(Mike Helfgot) Then came Lins' go-ahead score for the North Stars, which came two plays after Geneva missed a 31-yard field goal attempt.\nSteve Reaven is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\nPlayer of the game: Sean Chambers, Geneva, 17-for-32, 295 yards, 4 TDs, 2 INTs.\nKey performers: Geneva – Justin Taormina, 32 carries, 143 yards, TD; Jack Wassel, 7 receptions, 164 yards, 2 TDs; Griffin Bellano, INT, blocked PAT.
