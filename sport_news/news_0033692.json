That’s how the Wolfpack feels heading into tonight’s game at Virginia Tech. It comes with one day less of preparation than normal, but that might be just as well. With both teams coming off home losses in their Atlantic Coast Conference openers, expect there to be a heightened sense of urgency. There’s also the matter of making sure there’s not another hiccup. “The word of the week is ‘focus’ so I’m going to continue to focus on the game plan,” defensive end Bradley Chubb said. “I know everybody else on the defense and everybody on the offense is going to do the same thing.” N.C.State will look to recharge its rushing attack because that stalled frequently against Louisville. Virginia Tech has been uncharacteristically soft in the middle, giving up 197.4 yards per game on the ground to rank 101st nationally in that category. “The ball has been run on them, but they are a very good defense,” Thuney said. “Once again, it comes down to the offensive line being physical.” Virginia Tech could have quarterback Michael Brewer back for the first time since the opener Sept. 7, when he suffered a broken collarbone against OhioState. He has been cleared to play, and he has taken part in practices this week. Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer was noncommittal on the scale of Brewer’s potential role. His return, though, has split the quarterback repetitions with neither Brewer nor Brenden Motley receiving a full dose of practice work for an offense that has been much-criticized to begin with. “It’s just the situation we’re in right now,” Beamer said. “So you got to do what you got to do.” Brewer’s presence would give the Hokies more of an element in the passing attack, something the Wolfpack is taking under consideration. “I don’t know if it’s real that he’s going to play or (just) talk,” N.C.State coach Dave Doeren said. “But we’re going to prepare like he is and the defensive kids just have to be ready for more.” It will be Doeren’s first game in Blacksburg, Va., and he said he looks forward to the atmosphere and the experience, while acknowledging Lane Stadium is known as a hostile environment. Page 2 of 2 - In many ways, it’s a fresh start and it should have been easy during the week for the Wolfpack to lock its attention on Virginia Tech after the undefeated aspect of the season went by the wayside. “Let the chips fall where they fall,” Doeren said. “Let’s not lose because of last week’s game.” N.C.
