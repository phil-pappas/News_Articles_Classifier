He was fined for striking a Bills player by the NFL and ridiculed by opposing defensive backs, including Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie, who called the NFL’s 2014 Offensive Rookie of the Year a \"one-year wonder\" during a television interview on ESPN.\nThen, a handful of plays before celebrating an incredible touchdown catch against the 49ers, Beckham felt a tug at his hamstring Sunday night.\nThe issue kept him sidelined until, at his urging and with the training staff signing off, the Giants put him back in the game with the offense in position to win.\nBeckham drew a pass interference penalty that set up Eli Manning’s game-winning strike to Larry Donnell with 21 seconds left for the Giants’ 30-27 comeback triumph.\n\"I love football and there is no way you can’t be a part of moments like that. That is what you play for,\" Beckham said. \"To watch that ball go up and see Larry go up and know he is going to catch it and literally watch the ball all the way down into his hands and see him hold onto it just like this … it was great to be able to get the win. He grabbed it, scored and we won, and it was a great feeling.\"\nThe Giants celebrated the victory, and why not – they are alone in first place in the NFC East thanks to it, and they head to Philadelphia having dug out of a 0-2 hole with three consecutive wins for a \"Monday Night Football\" showdown in five days.\nNow comes the uncertainty regarding the availability of Beckham and Rueben Randle, among others, for a game that could wind up shaping the divisional race.\nBeckham and Randle underwent MRIs of their hamstrings on Monday, and while neither is believed to have sustained a serious injury, they’ve got some work to do in rehabilitation in order to be ready to play at their expected level. \nThat’s not counting Victor Cruz, a long shot to even be considered as the Giants return to Lincoln Financial Field for the first time since he sustained his knee injury.\nThere remains a chance that Manning will step into the huddle for the opening drive against Philadelphia with the same receivers he did to start the final one against San Francisco: Dwayne Harris, rookie Geremy Davis and former Packer Myles White, who was promoted from the Giants’ practice squad a week ago.\n\"We do have a couple of days and we’ll take full advantage of that,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \"I did tell our team that the important thing on a weekly basis, week in and week out, is to play these really tough physical football games and come right back and do it again the next week. We need more of our guys on the practice field, we need some consistency with our weeks. I’m hoping that we can get Odell and Rueben at least on a limited basis for the entire rest of the week. I know that’s [optimistic], but I would hope we could do that.\"\nIf the last week is any indication, Beckham and the Giants have found a way to turn hope into optimism and confidence thus far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:16:07.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
