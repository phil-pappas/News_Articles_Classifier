Image 24 of 24 WATCH: 'Hilarious kid' dances his heart out at Spurs' preseason game 1 / 24 Back to Gallery He may not call the Silver and Black his team, but the dance moves of a young basketball fan at the Spurs-Kings preseason game on Oct. 8 is making an impression on the Internet.\nThe boy, only known as “hilarious kid” on a YouTube video posted on the team's channel, made an aisle inside the Sleep Train Arena his stage as he got “low” to the sounds of Flo Rida with all eyes on him.\nThough Spurs fans may not agree with the probable motivation behind his impromptu jig — the Kings’ 95-92 win — there’s no denying he dances better than most twice his age.\nRELATED: San Antonio Spurs Silver Dancers tear up the dance floor when their teammate gets hitched\nOther kids attempted to move up the ranks from backup dancer to center stage but the “Nae Nae” enthusiast continued to steal the show.\nThe Spurs’ preseason schedule continues on the road Monday evening against the Heat with a 6:30 p.m. tipoff. The team will return to their renovated home , the AT&T Center, on Oct. 18, when little Spurs fans can get their chance to give this kid some competition.\nmmendoza@mysa.com\nTwitter: @MaddySkye", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6341971/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6342006/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://twitter.com/MaddySkye", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/21/76/52/4713126/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/10/44/6326539/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6342003/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/26/6342022/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/75/22/7066803/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/34/60/6409247/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/11/8778319/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6341971/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/41/25/7738730/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/14/06/7127470/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/43/64/7486730/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/21/76/52/4713126/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/20/41/7407716/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/03/8777982/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/27/47/50/6191667/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/03/8777982/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/10/44/6326539/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/16/30/7398953/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://mysa.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20San%20Antonio%20Express-News&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/16/30/7398953/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6342013/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqykVwCtSeY", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6342013/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6341997/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/27/63/63/6241526/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/27/63/63/6241521/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/75/22/7066803/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/27/63/63/6241532/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/11/8778319/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/26/6342022/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/34/60/6409247/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6342006/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/22/24/45/4802925/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/27/63/63/6241532/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6341997/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/27/63/63/6241526/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/41/25/7738730/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6342000/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/22/24/45/4802925/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6342003/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/14/25/6342000/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/43/64/7486730/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/27/63/63/6241521/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/27/47/50/6191667/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/16/30/7398953/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/20/41/7407716/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/14/06/7127470/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqykVwCtSeY"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:18:05.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
