You have to nail it,\" said Anderson. \n\"We know we'll have to bowl very well to do that. It's an exciting challenge; the conditions, the heat, if we do perform well it will be very satisfying. And it is very important we start well.\" \nAnderson admitted facing a formidable Pakistan. \n\"We know they (Pakistan) will be challenging, the heat will be a tough ask for the bowlers and will make it difficult for us. But we've acclimatised well. \n\"We are excited for the challenge and we've done all we can do be ready for Tuesday. We are aware of how we performed last time we were here,\" said Anderson, one of four survivours of the 3-0 rout England suffered here in 2012. \nAnderson said England have improved in the last three years. \n\"We've turned things around a little bit, a change in personnel, and as we saw in the Ashes - we lost them in 2013 but then won them back - so it's all about how you prepare and play in that particular series. \n\"What happened in the past doesn't really matter that much.\" \nAnderson, the leading wicket-taker for his country with 413 in 107 Tests, said beating Pakistan would be a top achievement. \n\"Especially with Pakistan's record here, it's going to be a big ask and if we do manage to win it would be right up there (with Australia and India),\" said Anderson. \nAnderson reckoned Pakistan batsman Azhar Ali -- ruled out of the first Test with a foot infection -- will be missed. \n\"He (Ali) was the guy to get out for them even with their experienced players after him, I thought he was the key wicket for us so he'll be a big miss but they have plenty of other quality players who have made big runs out here.\" Copyright AFP (Agence France-Presse), 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:48:35.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
