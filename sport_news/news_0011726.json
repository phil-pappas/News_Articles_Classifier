Vista Grande falls to Tempe By MARC DAVID For the Dispatch   \nCASA GRANDE — Tempe set the tempo on the opening drive of the game. And its defense was well prepared for Vista Grande’s read-option offense. \nControlling the line of scrimmage as well as the clock, the Buffaloes made it two straight Division III/Section I wins Friday night by upending the host Spartans 12-7. One week after knocking off No. 13 Arcadia, Tempe took down another higher-rated team with its win over No. 9 Vista Grande. \n“We knew we had to play well in three phases — defense, running the ball and on special teams,” Tempe coach Brian Walker said. “Vista Grande has some great athletes. But we had to focus on what we do. At the beginning of the season, we didn’t focus well and lost some games because we beat ourselves.” \nTempe (3-4, 2-1 section) turned in another rock-solid defensive performance, holding VG to 144 yards of total offense. The Spartans (5-2, 1-2) had no answer for rangy junior My-King Johnson, who had two sacks, a tackle for loss and blew up several other VG plays. \n“My-King does a good job on the edge but he gets a lot of help from (tackle) Jordan Davis and other linemen,” Walker said. “And it helps when our secondary is working well downfield.” \nThe pass defense was so effective that Vista Grande completed just three passes for 37 yards. The Spartans weren’t able to establish the running game until the fourth quarter when Bryant Henderson came into the game at quarterback. \nTaking over on its own 44, Vista Grande used a seven-play, 56-yard drive to get its only score as Daniel Padilla leapfrogged the pile from the 1 with 5:40 left in the game. Henderson rushed for 32 yards during the drive and completed an 11-yard pass to Luis Palacios to set up Padilla’s TD. \nThe Spartans got the ball back twice after that but in poor field position each time thanks to punts inside the 20 by Bobby Manning. \n“That’s a good football team that has played good (opponents),” VG coach Tracy Stuart said. “55 (Johnson) is good — we knew that before the year started. We couldn’t block him. Their secondary played well. That’s a good, solid team.” \nThe Buffaloes controlled the clock during the first half. They went 67 yards with the opening kickoff, chewing up six minutes, 21 seconds. Aided by a roughing-the-passer penalty on third down, Tempe moved into the red zone and scored on Jonathan Ibarra’s 30-yard field goal. \nAfter a booming 50-yard Nik Halter punt that was downed at the 2 by Emilio Rizzo with five seconds left in the first quarter, the Buffaloes went to work again. They put together an impressive 16-play drive, completing three third-down plays and scoring on Manning’s 18-yard touchdown pass to David Johnson with 5:15 left in the second quarter for a 10-0 lead. Tempe enjoyed a 15:40-8:20 advantage in possession time in the first half. \n“They kept us from getting any (offensive) rhythm,” Stuart said. “They controlled the field position.” \nThe possession time was more equal in the second half, but penalties killed any offensive momentum Vista Grande had until the fourth-quarter drive. In fact, the third holding call of the half backed the Spartans inside their 10. Two sacks resulted in Tempe’s final two points on a safety. \nVista Grande played well enough defensively, yielding 192 yards of total offense. Deandre Walker and Adrian Leos had sacks, and Palacios and Leos had tackles for losses. But Manning did an excellent job of managing the Tempe offense, converting 8 of 16 third-down plays. He didn’t commit a turnover. Also, the senior came through with the clutch fourth-quarter punts. \n“Their punter had two great kicks,” Stuart said. “He knocked it away from our returner and got good bounces to pin us deep. We just didn’t play well. But that is the best defensive team we have faced this season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:17:30.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
