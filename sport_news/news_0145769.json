(Image Source: Brad Mills/USA TODAY Sports) \nPostseason baseball. Not many thought the New York Mets would get there. Not this season. There was hope for the future of the Orange & Blue prior to the season, mainly because of the slew of fireball-throwing young guns the Mets had in their organization. If they could stay healthy and pitch to their potential New York’s National League team would become contenders once again. Maybe, as soon as 2016. \nWell, the Mets have arrived a year early and while we don’t want to downplay the moves GM Sandy Alderson made in-season, it’s the starting rotation that is the foundation of the club and the biggest reason why many consider them a dangerous team this postseason. Here’s a look at the projected starters for Games 1-4 of the National League Divisional Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \n(Game 1) Jacob deGrom: Last year’s rookie of the year, Jacob deGrom , is set to take the ball in Game 1 in Dodger Stadium on Friday night. Statistically, deGrom was the Mets best starter this season, tied for the team lead with 14 wins (team-best plus six in W/L), with the most quality starts (23), strikeouts (205) and highest WAR (4.7), as well as the lowest ERA (2.54) and WHIP (0.98). \nInside the Numbers: Manager Terry Collins may have picked the All-Star ahead of Matt Harvey because the Mets want to limit Harvey’s innings in the Divisional Series, but make no mistake deGrom has earned it. Having said that, he’s been a better pitcher at home (1.99 ERA vs. 3.09 away), during the day (1.10 ERA vs. 3.44 at night) and September was his worst month of the season (4.50 ERA). After skipping a start, deGrom appears to have rediscovered his form allowing just one run and five hits while striking out 16 (2 BBs) over 10 innings in his final two starts of the season. \n(Game 2) Noah Syndergaard: A big part of New York’s acceleration from a team of the future to a team of the present was the promotion of Noah Syndergaard . The hardest of the hard throwers, Thor pitched like he belonged from Day 1. The 6’6” rookie went 9-7 with a 3.24 ERA and a WHIP of just 1.05. His 9.96 strikeouts per nine innings were the best among the starters. \nInside the Numbers: As the Mets approached the postseason there was much discussion regarding how New York’s starters should be slotted, with many making the case for pitching Syndergaard at Citi Field, where he is 7-2 with a 2.46 ERA and a .196 batting average against. His numbers away from the pitcher friendly confines aren’t nearly as good, as teams are hitting .258 against him leading to a 2-5 record and a 4.23 ERA on the road. Before you’re ready to write the Mets off for Game 2, note the club has won his past three road starts and the rookie is 2-0, having allowed just three earned runs over 14.2 innings (1.84 ERA) with 19 Ks (1 BB) in his final two road starts of the season. \n(Game 3) Matt Harvey: Despite Jacob deGrom’s slightly superior numbers most people consider Matt Harvey to be New York’s ace. Ideally, they’d have their bulldog set to go twice in the NLDS if it were to go five games, but that’s not the scenario the Mets find themselves in. However, if they are able to earn a split in LA, New York will feel very good about their chances of taking control of the series in Game 3 with Harvey on the hill. Coming off missing the entire 2014 season, Harvey was a question mark entering 2015 and he has returned to his ace-like form quicker than most, throwing a career-high 189.1 innings with a 13-8 record, a 2.71 ERA and a 1.02 WHIP, while averaging 8.94 K/9. \nInside the Numbers: Since the Mets skipped Harvey’s start in mid-September he’s been lights out, allowing just two earned runs over his final 17.2 innings (1.02 ERA) while striking out 24 (1 BB). As long as he has his command Harvey appears set up to dominate in this round. Like his teammates, Harvey is better at home (2.23 ERA vs. 3.42 ERA away) but he loves the bright lights (2.42 ERA at night vs. 3.42 ERA during the day). \n(Game 4) Steven Matz: Ideally the Mets would love to start rookie southpaw Steven Matz in Game 4, but that depends on his health, specifically his ailing back. Back spasms kept Matz from making his final start of the season and a torn lat muscle kept the Long Island native out of the rotation for two months (from July 5 – September 6). He threw what has been deemed a successful bullpen session on Tuesday, putting Matz in line to throw about 90 pitches in an instructional league game on Thursday and the Mets hope Game 4 next Tuesday. If Matz can’t go they have several options including veteran starters Barolo Colon (14-13, 4.16 ERA) and Jonathan Niese (9-10, 4.13 ERA), more likely Colon. Pitching deGrom on short rest (and then Syndergaard on regular rest in Game 5) is another possibility the Mets will consider if Matz is unavailable. \nInside the Numbers: In very limited duty (6 starts, 35.2 innings), Matz was supremely successful, going 4-0 with a 2.27 ERA. Even though he had the lowest ERA among the starters, Matz did suffer some command issue (10 BBs), which led to high pitch counts and a WHIP (1.23) that was closer to Colon than deGrom or Harvey. While he allows a .306 BAA with no one on, Matz knows how to bear down, allowing a .188 BA with runners on and .156 with runners on in scoring position. He pitched six scoreless innings against LA in his second MLB start. Why Colon over Niese? He’s pitched much better of late, posting a 3.81 ERA after the All-Star break (4.46 before) and at times has been dominant. Colon had a 2.83 ERA in August and 3.03 ERA in September. Meanwhile, Niese has been worse after the break (4.88 ERA vs. 3.61 before) and has been downright awful down the stretch of the season (5.17 August ERA, 5.64 September ERA). \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
