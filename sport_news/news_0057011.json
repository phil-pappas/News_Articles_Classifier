He just really dominates the middle for us and controls the game.\" \n\"(Conner) is a very skilled player, we tell our guys not to dive and to contain him,\" River View coach Mike Burr said. \"He is a very skilled player.\" \nRoahrig said he played off of the Black Bears aggressiveness and that led to some success. \n\"When you are getting ready to go one way they are biting so hard for it, so you cut it back the other way really quick,\" Roahrig said. \"The guys were talking to me and letting me know where the defenders were that made it easier for me as well.\" \nDespite Roahrig's success in the midfield, Burr said River View played better than it did last time out against the Redskins. \n\"We just kind of had two breakdowns that led to their goals, take those two breakdowns away, I thought we played as well or maybe even better than (Coshocton) did,\" he said. \nThe first breakdown, came with 5:37 left in the first half, when Roahrig dribbled down the middle of the field, through four Black Bear defenders and put a shot past goalkeeper Jorn Hocter, who finished with five saves. \n\"We kind of escorted him right into the six-yard box and let him shoot,\" Burr said. \nAt that moment, neither team's offense had gotten going, it was the defenses that were playing well. Coshocton had three shots on goal and River View didn't have any. \nBecause of the offensive lapses, Roahrig's goal was even more important. \n\"They had trouble getting shots the last time we played them and that's a credit to our defense,\" Dunlap said. \"They work really hard and we have really tried to improve that part of our game because the first part of the year we were really on a rollercoaster I didn't like.\" \n\"The defensive guys don't get enough credit because they don't score goals, but they save goals.\" \nThe second half was more of the same, as neither team could take full control of the game, but then River View's defense had its second breakdown, leading to Roahrig's second goal of the game and 17th of the season. This goal sealed the game with 9:46 left in the game. \n\"There were chances that we had to clear that ball and we just kept bouncing around inside the 18 and the six and good players are going to convert them,\" Burr said. \"I told them at halftime we have to keep (Roahrig) marked. He is who they go through.\" \nThe district draw for the postseason is Sunday and each team will be looking at where they sit in the bracket. Coshocton (4-5-4) have now won three of its last four, while River View (7-6-1) has done the same. \ncteaguerob@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:55:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
