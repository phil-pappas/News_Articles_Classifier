(AP) - A former maintenance worker at a New York tennis academy co-owned by John McEnroe says he and others weren't paid for overtime.\nJose Magalhaes says he and others routinely worked 10-hour days at the Long Island academy but were not paid overtime, as required by state labor law.\nNewsday ( http://nwsdy.li/1jq3hXG ) reports that the suit was filed against the John McEnroe Tennis Academy at Sportime NY in Kings Park. It also names McEnroe, a four-time U.S. Open champion.\nMagalhaes was a maintenance worker at the Kings Park facility from March 2011 to June 2014.\nThere was no immediate comment from the lawyer for Sportime NY. McEnroe's lawyer hasn't responded.\nMcEnroe has another tennis academy in Syosset (seye-AH'-siht). He is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time.\nThis story has been corrected to show that the lawsuit was filed against an academy in Kings Park, not Eastchester.\nInformation from: Newsday, http://www.newsday.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://nwsdy.li/1jq3hXG"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:34:12.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
