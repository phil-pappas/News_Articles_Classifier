It is a two-part rhyming saying, the first part ending with “eshtaddi” and the second part ending with “qaddi”. Use this proverb in reference to someone who’s so full of themself that they expect others to bend over backwards to please them.\nSource: Egyptian Proverbs, (Al-Ahram Center for Translation and Publishing, 1986) by Ahmed Taymour Pasha\nTranslated by: Nabil Shawkat\n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:59:27.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
