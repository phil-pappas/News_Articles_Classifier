(AP) - Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant has signed a warrant seeking to have a suspect in a sexual assault extradited from Florida to face charges in Ocean Springs.\nBryant spokeswoman Nicole Webb confirms to The Associated Press on Wednesday that the governor has signed the warrant to have 24-year-old Cameron May, of Biloxi, returned to Mississippi.\nJackson County District Attorney Tony Lawrence told the Mississippi Press ( http://bit.ly/1VRWCqc ) that transferring May could take two weeks. May was captured Sept. 21 in Florida and refused to waive his right to an extradition hearing. The governor's warrant eliminates the need for the hearing.\nIt was not immediately clear whether May has an attorney. He is accused of attacking a 33-year-old woman Sept. 10 in Ocean Springs.\nThe AP does not identify victims of sexual assault.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
