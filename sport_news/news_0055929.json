Photo: GENNA MARTIN, SEATTLEPI.COM Seattle Mariners hire Andy McKay as new farm director 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nSeattle Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto continued to rework the organization's infrastructure Wednesday when he announced the hiring of Andy McKay as the new director of player development. \nMcKay, who replaces Chris Gwynn, has spent the past three years as the peak performance coordinator for the Colorado Rockies' farm system after being hired in September 2012. Much of McKay's background, however, is in managing. \nBefore working for the Rockies, he spent 14 seasons as the head coach at Sacramento City College, where he went 427-205-2, won eight league titles and a state championship. He was an assistant coach at Sacramento City College the previous five years, which followed a one-year stint as a player/coach at the University of Tampa in 1993 during the school's run to a Division II national title. \nA Sacramento native, McCay attended Sacramento City College and Sacramento State. He's also coached in the Cape Cod and Northwoods summer leagues. \nHoldovers from former general manager Jack Zduriencik's regime include scouting director Tom McNamara and Tom Kissner, the club's director of international operations, along with assistant general manager Jeff Kingston. \nDipoto has yet hire a new manager after firing Lloyd McClendon earlier this month. \nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Mariners news .
