Lisa Ann Vilmur, 43, of the Groveland area, was arrested July 30 on suspicion of one felony count of recklessly causing a fire of a structure or forest land. No trial date has been set. She was released from Tuolumne County Jail Sept. 16 on $100,000 bond. Cal Fire officials said the blaze, which threatened 25 homes and prompted evacuations in the Hells Hollow area, was caused by an escaped debris pile burn. Edward Barrera, 74, of Big Oak Flat, who used to live by Vilmur and considers her a close friend, said Vilmur has done pile burns in the past and was conscious of fire safety. “She always charged the hose and had a shovel out here and made sure there was nothing around that would ever catch,” he said, adding that he witnessed 30 to 40 of Vilmur’s pile burns. “She’s not one of those that would leave any fire whatsoever.” But according to Matthew Gilbert, a Cal Fire battalion chief, Vilmur was less than careful. Prior to the Big Creek Fire, Vilmur had three campfires at her campsite that she failed to extinguish and the Forest Service had to be called out, according to a Cal Fire arrest report. “Given Vilmur’s past history regarding extinguishing campfires and debris fires, I am concerned Vilmur may again recklessly cause a fire,” Gilbert said in the report. The arrest report does not state when those incidents took place. In an investigation report, Gilbert said Vilmur admitted to starting a fire to dispose of trash between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. July 29. Vilmur had a California campfire permit that explained how to extinguish fires, the investigation report says. Barrera said Vilmur visited him one day after her release from Tuolumne County Jail. “(She said) she had subpoenaed several people regarding the matter,” he said. Barrera said he does not know anything about what occurred the day the Big Creek Fire started, but he believes Vilmur is innocent. “She has several others that feel the same as I do,” he added. “She’s not a bad woman.” Vilmur’s attorney, Charles Stoner, did not return calls seeking comment. The Big Creek Fire started July 29 off Highway 120 and Sprague Road, and burned 204 acres near Groveland before it was fully contained Aug. 4. Vilmur pleaded not guilty Aug. 7 in Tuolumne County Superior Court before Judge Eleanor Provost. Her trial setting conference is scheduled for Oct. 26.
