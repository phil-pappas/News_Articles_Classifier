Here are some highlights:\nThe Bautista bat flip - have you ever seen a bat flip like that?\nHolland: He's the most animated player I've ever seen. After watching him in the outfield cry about every single thing, it's unbelievable. I don't care if he hits a home run off me, that's fine, I give up home runs, I've struck people out, I do all that stuff, it's how baseball goes. But the way you do it - is he better than the game? Yeah, you lived in the moment, that's great. You hit a home run? Yeah, you can pimp it. That's fine. But the way he did it, I just think that one - that's a bit much. That's cool if you want to stare at the pitcher, because obviously the pitcher made the mistake. If it's me, I made the mistake; you hit the home run? Cool, stare at me. I'm going to be the one that's not actually staring at you, I'm going to watch and see how far you just hit it because that's how I am. I like to punish myself by seeing that. But the way he did it, I don't like it at all. I mean, personally, I don't like him, either. Especially after seeing more about him during the game, and being out in the outfield and seeing how he complains about every single thing. It's like, no matter what, if you throw anything close to the plate, and it's a ball, it's supposed to be a ball for him - no matter what. It's like we can't have any calls or anything like that, it's always his way. I just don't like that. I'm not a big fan of him.\nDid you have those feelings going into this series?\nHolland: Before, no. I actually respected the guy. I talked to him, I thought he was a fairly nice guy, and I've never really paid attention to him out in the outfield or the antics that he does because I'm always - either I had to pitch against him, so I'm studying up on what I need to do to get those guys out. I'm not sitting there watching him throw his arms up and throw his glove down on the ground and dance around in the outfield. I don't see that. And it's kind of a tired act.\nHow was the bat flip received by the rest of the team?\nHolland: Trust me, nobody likes it. I won't say anything else on those guys, but I'll speak on my own side of it. I didn't like it, and they don't like it.\nAre you still watching the playoffs? Do you have a rooting interest?\nHolland: Oh yeah. I'm rooting for Kansas City. Couple of my buddies play for Kansas City, definitely want to see them go out there. One of my closest friends, Eric Hosmer, is playing so I'm pulling for them. I know they don't seem to get along with Toronto either.\nRangers eliminated from postseason\nRangers loss reviewed Rangers offseason issue No. 2: Improving team balance could cost this key contributor\nRangers could have another major pitching free agent to deal with\nRangers offseason issue No. 1: Is there enough starting pitching?
