The popular star said he is surprised why Bafana Bafana are not dominating the African continent with the type of football they play. The mild-mannered goalkeeper who is a cult hero in this Central American country of around 5 million inhabitants said South Africans are talented, mobile and can destroy any team on a given day.Navas says: ‘Looking at how they competed here, I am still surprised that South Africa is not dominating Africa and even most top countries in the world. If they play this type of football on regular basis then surely they should be among the giants in the world. They are electric fast, can pass the ball with high tempo and hardly lose possession when they are in charge.’ The Real Madrid star said he was impressed by the South African culture of football: ‘It is quite different from either the European or South or Central American style. Their football is refreshing and exciting to see. I suppose they need to play against top sides in the world in order to express themselves more and dominate on regular basis.’The international star was beaten by a cheeky Andile Jali lob in the ninth minute but Navas said Jali was only among a myriad of great players in the Bafana Bafana squad: ‘I am not trying to impress anyone. If anything, no one normally praises your vanquisher but we need to give credit where it is due, South Africa are a good football playing nation and that is a fact.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:44:58.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
