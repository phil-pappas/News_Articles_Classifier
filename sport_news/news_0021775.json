Visit operasouthwest.org or call 243-0591 or 724-4771 Verdi’s classic captures roiling emotions of rejection and disloyalty set against the tumult of war.\nOpera Southwest will open its 43rd season with the tragic opera on Oct. 25 at the National Hispanic Cultural Center.\nWhile Verdi’s score is commonly thought of as the height of grand opera, its nucleus is an intimate human drama, said Anthony Barrese, conductor and OSW artistic director. Most of the scenes feature small duets and trios, but its heart beats to a deeply personal rhythm.\nIt all starts as the Egyptians capture and enslave Aida, an Ethiopian princess. The Egyptian military commander Radamés struggles to choose between his love for her and his loyalty to the Pharaoh.\nTo complicate the plot, the Pharaoh’s daughter Amneris is in love with Radamés, but he does not return her feelings.\nStage director Brian Robertson wants to make the grand opera that is “Aida” intimate within a cast of 60.\n“The great challenge of it is can we find the personal story inside the majesty?” he said in a telephone interview from Cincinnati, where he was working for the University of Cincinnati Opera Department.\nShana Blake Hill, left, portrays Aida and Clay Hilley is Radamés in the Opera Southwest production of “Aida” at the National Hispanic Cultural Center. (Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal)\n“It has the majestical potential. But there are sections that come together with small staircases,” he said. “Each of those sections can be closed off for more intimate scenes. We’re using architecture to isolate them.”\nFor Albuquerque native Kirstin Chavez, the role of Amneris represents the dream of a lifetime.\n“I always hoped I would be a Verdi mezzo,” she said in a telephone interview from her Dallas home. “I think now is the time.”\nChavez lived here until she was 4 years old, but spent most of her formative years in Malaysia, where her parents worked as English and music teachers.\nShe earned her bachelor’s of music degree from New Mexico State University. Her father gave her her first voice lesson when she was 16.\nChavez attended the Eastman School of Music, debuting at the Metropolitan Opera in 2005.\nAmneris can be played as a villain; a haughty, arrogant princess. But Chavez hopes to create a more three-dimensional character.\nHer character pleads with Radamés to renounce Aida; Amneris can save him from death when he is condemned for betraying his people.\nKristin Chavez portrays Amneris in the Opera Southwest’s production of “Aida” at the National Hispanic Cultural Center. (Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal)\n“She’s a very tortured soul,” Chavez said, “and I hope to get that across.”\nTenor Clay Hilley plays the caught-in-the-middle Radamés.\n“He’s a young, idealistic warrior who has his mind on one thing – his love for Aida,” Hilley said in a telephone interview from Baltimore.\nBut he is betrothed to Amneris.\n“Of course, one never likes the pre-arranged marriage,” Hilley said. “The Pharaoh wants me to marry his daughter and be the power couple.”\nFlush with Verdi’s opulent, high-altitude arias, “Aida” pitches a steep vocal climb.\n“The main melody puts unaccented syllables on accented beats,” Hilley said. “You have to jump up at the end of the phrase. The aria is very exposed, (then) it fades into nothingness. Learning how to do that without resorting to falsetto is a challenge. Then you breathe a huge sigh of relief and let the diva come out.”\nFamiliar to Albuquerque audiences as Leila in Bizet’s “The Pearl Fishers” and Violetta in Verdi’s “La Traviata,” Shana Blake Hill is returning in the title role.\nAida and Radamés fall in love while he transports her from the battlefield to the court.\nA stolen jewel, Aida is trapped between revealing herself to Radamés and concealing her identity from the Pharaoh. But she can’t reveal her gilded background for fear of becoming a pawn.\nShana Blake Hill portrays Aida in the Opera Southwest’s production of “Aida” at the National Hispanic Cultural Center. (Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal)\n“She was like a ghost,” Hill said.\nVerdi gave his leading lady her own distinctive voice.\n“Her music has always got this kind of foreignness to it,” Hill said. “There’s a grace note that is almost like a flute. It’s got a mournful, far away transcendent quality. She’s always reaching out to the gods for mercy.”\nBut Aida is no victim, Hill maintained.\n“She shows a great deal of internal fortitude and grace,” she said. “There’s this inherent, quiet nobility in her carriage.”\n“Aida” is Hill’s fifth performance with Opera Southwest.\n“It’s been wonderful to have an association with this company and watch it grow,” she said. “This kind of company is the future of this art form. This is a community that loves its artists.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life04_jd_18oct_3aida-640x486.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life01_jd_18oct_cover-e1445139553265-339x400.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life04_jd_18oct_2aida-336x600.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life04_jd_18oct_1aida-418x600.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:43:52.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
