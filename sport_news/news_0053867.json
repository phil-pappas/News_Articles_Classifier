Miller Lite and Techniques for Effective Alcohol Management (TEAM) Coalition partnered to promote responsible drinking and traffic safety at Talladega Superspeedway. \nBefore the race, 117 fans made the pledge to be a designated driver for their group. All of them had the opportunity to receive a free souvenir photo, instant prizes and a chance to be selected as the Designated Driver of the Race. One randomly selected responsible fan will win the Responsibility Has Its Rewards sweepstakes. The grand prize includes two tickets and two VIP experiences to the next NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Talladega Superspeedway. \n“We applaud those who signed the pledge to be a designated driver for their group during race weekend at DEGA,” said Grant Lynch, Chairman of Talladega Superspeedway. “It’s important for everyone to be responsible when choosing to consume alcohol while enjoying the race weekend.” \n“We believe that with great beer comes great responsibility, and we’re thrilled to partner with NASCAR, Richmond International Raceway and TEAM Coalition to help promote responsibility at the track,” said Diane Wagner, MillerCoors responsibility commerce manager. “For many legal drinking age fans, enjoying a beer on race day is part of the NASCAR experience, and we want to encourage fans to enjoy the race responsibly and plan ahead for a safe ride home from the track.” \n\"The success of the Responsibility Has Its Rewards campaign is a direct result of the commitment from our members and all the designated-driver program partners, including the tracks, beer companies and state offices of highway safety,\" said Jill Pepper, executive director of TEAM Coalition. \"Teamwork is what this campaign is all about. We are demonstrating that when everyone – including the fans – takes responsibility, everyone wins.\" \n\nAbout MillerCoors \nThrough its diverse collection of storied breweries, MillerCoors brings American beer drinkers an unmatched selection of the highest quality beers steeped in centuries of brewing heritage.
