The Coalers fell to the Lions, 7-3. By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nCOAL CITY — It was hard to find fault with Coal City's defense Friday night. After all, the Coalers only allowed seven points to Lisle while blocking two field goal attempts and recovering two fumbles.

Coal City must now win next week at Seneca, and then hope they have enough playoff points to qualify for the playoffs. \nCoal City caught a break early when Lisle's Mark McGrath made a 30-yard field goal, but a penalty nullified the play and the Lions had to try again from five yards back. This time, Coal City's Mike Chiarrapa blocked the field goal to keep the game scoreless. Coal City's Mike Pampuch later recovered a Lisle fumble and Coal City took over on the Lisle 39. Brad Littleton then kicked a 34-yard field goal to give the Coalers a 3-0 lead. \nCoal City's defense made that lead stand until halftime, and Lisle took the second-half kickoff and drove 80 yards on 12 plays, capped by a four-yard run by quarterback McGrath, whose kick made it 7-3. \nThe Coalers had the ball at their own 26 with 3:12 remaining, and got a 61-yard completion from Christian Johnson to Brad Littleton on a halfback option pass. However, a pass was later intercepted by Lisle in the end zone. \nLittleton caught five passes for 82 yards for the Coalers, while Nick Micetich went 7 for 23 for 53 yards and Johnson completed his only pass attempt. Joe Starkey had 54 rushing yards on 14 carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:14:51.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
