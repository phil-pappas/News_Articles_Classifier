The Royals lead the AL Championship Series 3-2. \nMurphy broke the postseason mark set by Houston's Carlos Beltran in 2004 with a two-run drive in the eighth inning. \nLucas Duda homered and drove in five runs. Travis d'Arnaud also connected as the Mets advanced to their first World Series since 2000. \nKris Bryant homered for Chicago, but a championship drought dating to 1908 continues. Joe Maddon's young team had many believing this might be the year, but the Cubs did little against the Mets' fresh aces. Blue Jays 7, Royals 1: Marco Estrada took the mound with one task: save the season for Toronto. He did it, pitching one-hit ball into the eighth inning to give Toronto's tattered bullpen a rest, and the Blue Jays beat Kansas City to close to 3-2 in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series. \n\"It's the start that we needed,\" shortstop Troy Tulowitzki said. \"They're a great team over there. We know that. But this guy kept them off balance and allowed the offense to settle in and get some runs.\" Advertisement \nTulowitzki provided three of those runs. He broke the game open with a bases-clearing double off Kelvin Herrera in the sixth, giving him seven RBIs in the series. Edwin Encarnacion had walked with the bases loaded against Edinson Volquez, who seemed flustered by a couple of close calls against the Royals. \nKansas City totaled 22 runs and 30 hits in the first two games in Toronto, but Estrada faced the minimum 20 batters before Lorenzo Cain walked with two outs in the seventh. Closer Roberto Osuna was perfect in the ninth. \nYordano Ventura will start for the defending AL champions on Friday in Game 6 against David Price, the Game 2 loser. \nToronto is trying to become just the 13th team to rally and win among 80 who trailed 3-1 in best-of-seven postseason series. It has happened four of 17 times in the LCS, including when the Royals bounced back against the Blue Jays in 1985 en route to Kansas City's only World Series title. In this year's best-of-five Division Series, Toronto fell behind 0-2, then won three straight against Texas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:06:37.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
