I crown Comment Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 7:01 PM Updated at 7:01 PM By The Leader staff Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 7:01 PM BATH | Bath Haverling scored all of the points it needed in the first half in its 53-0 win over Dansville Saturday. On Senior Day, the Rams (7-0) pitched another shutout and also laid claim to back-to-back LCAA Div. I championships. “It was a very special day for us today,” Bath head coach Wayne Carroll said. “We faced a brutal schedule this year with five of the seven teams being sectional teams last year. The seniors really came out to play today and they were rewarded. We won this title outright.” The Rams made a statement in the first quarter as Bath scored five touchdowns en route to a 39-0 lead. Patrick Brewer scored on runs of 15 and 40 yards. Connor DiDomineck added TD runs of six and13 yards, while Tyler Finch added a 41-yard scoring carry. Quarterback Michael Rice completed a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jake Taggart at the start of the second quarter, before Brewer closed the scoring with an 8-yard touchdown run. Brewer ran for 84 yards on five carries, while Finch tallied 49 yards on three carries and DiDomineck added 34 yards on four tries. On the day, Bath amassed 214 yards on the ground. Dansville carried the ball 33 times for 83 yards. “Defensively, we had a lot of takeaways today. Those four turnovers helped us get the ball in good field position,” Carroll said. “The defense played lights out today.” Bath will enter the Section V, Class C sectionals as the No. 2 seed, with the top spot going to East Rochester – which is also 7-0. The Rams will open the playoffs at home against Letchworth-Warsaw at 1 p.m. Saturday.
