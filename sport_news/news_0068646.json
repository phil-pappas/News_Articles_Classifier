This saying, now outdated, contains archaic words and references that may make it hard for the contemporary listener to understand. \"Dawaya\" is the clay bowl at the end of a smoking pipe, and belts used to carry heavy weights, although still in use, are less common now than was the case in pre-industrial societies.\nSource: Egyptian Proverbs, (Al-Ahram Center for Translation and Publishing, 1986) by Ahmed Taymour Pasha\nTranslated by: Nabil Shawkat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:51:05.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
