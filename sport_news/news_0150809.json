Bradford seems to be getting into a rhythm with Philly's up-tempo offense, passing for 603 yards and 5 TDs over the last two weeks. Next up: The NFL's most generous secondary.\nArian Foster, RB, Texans at Jaguars. He's gotten past his groin injury and reclaimed the workhorse role in Houston's backfield. Meanwhile, Alfred Blue is dealing with a turf toe.\nAntonio Andrews, RB, Titans vs. Dolphins. Though he's part of a committee that includes his running quarterback and Bishop Sankey, Andrews has reached the end zone in both of the games he's played. This week: Miami's league-worst run defense comes to town.\nMore coverage VOTE: Who will win Giants-Eagles game? Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone! FORUMS: Will the Eagles make the playoffs? Latest NFL odds SHOP: Eagles Training Camp sportswear Marvin Jones, WR, Bengals at Bills. Jones hasn't seen the end zone since Week 3, but he should have plenty of opportunities against the soft spot in the Bills' defense.\nDonte Moncrief, WR, Colts vs. Patriots. All signs point to the return of Andrew Luck, which is bad news for Andre Johnson and great news for the speedy Moncrief.\nMore thumbs up (excluding the no-brainers): QBs Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Andy Dalton, Joe Flacco, Blake Bortles, Cam Newton; RBs T.J. Yeldon, Dion Lewis, Lamar Miller, Frank Gore, Chris Ivory, DeMarco Murray, Melvin Gordon, Charcandrick West; WRs Mike Wallace, Jordan Matthews, Alshon Jeffery, James Jones, Kendall Wright, Allen Hurns, Keenan Allen, Allen Robinson.\nRoll 'em back Andrew Luck, QB, Colts vs. Patriots. Luck will be forced to drop back often, exposing his ailing shoulder to plenty of big hits behind Indy's porous line. New England's secondary has claimed as many interceptions (six) as the touchdowns they've surrendered. We haven't seen the 2014 version of Luck yet, and I don't expect him to re-appear this week either.\nRedskins RBs at Jets. This has turned into a three-pronged backfield with Chris Thompson contributing mostly as a receiver. Alfred Morris hasn't come close to 100 combined yards in a game since Week 1, and he hasn't reached the end zone all season. Matt Jones is fighting through a sprained toe. Leave them all alone against the Jets' stout run defense.\nGiovani Bernard, RB, Bengals at Bills. Though Bernard is the preferred option over backfield mate Jeremy Hill these days, both backs should have a rough day against the Bills' ferocious run defense. Travis Benjamin, WR, Browns vs. Broncos. John McCown will be harassed mercilessly by Denver's pass rush, leaving Benjamin little time to find a seam in their stingy secondary. Avoid all Cleveland players in this contest.\nSammy Watkins, WR, Bills vs. Bengals. The good news is that Watkins (calf) is expected to return this week. The bad news is he's returning to an offense in disarray. E.J. Manuel will be under center, the Bills' running game is a shambles and the Bengals are brimming with confidence.\nMore thumbs down: QBs Matt Stafford, Ryan Tannehill, Teddy Bridgewater, Jay Cutler, Kirk Cousins, Colin Kaepernick, Josh McCown, Mike Vick, Ryan Fitzpatrick; RBs Jeremy Hill, Rashad Jennings, Bishop Sankey, Ameer Abdullah, Ahmad Bradshaw, C.J. Anderson, Knile Davis, Duke Johnson, Isaiah Crowell, Andre Ellington, Jonathan Stewart; WRs Pierre Garcon, Doug Baldwin, Golden Tate, Andre Johnson, Michael Floyd, Marquess Wilson, Percy Harvin, Torrey Smith, Kenny Stills, Martavis Bryant, Jaelen Strong, Nelson Agholor, Markus Wheaton, DeSean Jackson, Rishard Matthews.\nTaking a flier Kamar Aiken, WR, Ravens at 49ers. With Steve Smith (back) highly unlikely to return this week, Aiken should again be Joe Flacco's main target in a matchup with one of the league's worst pass defenses.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:10:27.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
