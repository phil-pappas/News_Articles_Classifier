Few become public personas, known by fans or used by Nick Saban as the only identifier in a news conference.\nMeet Shank.\nHis given name is Alphonse Taylor, Alabama's starting right guard. Somehow the fun-loving offensive lineman got the moniker of a crude prison weapon. How'd that happen?\n\"I've had that nickname since park-league football, I'm talking like 10-years-old,\" Taylor said. \"My park-league coach gave me that name. I've never understood it, really. It just stuck with me all the way until now.\"\nRELATED: Guide to Alabama football player nicknames from 'The Sheriff' to 'Caveman'\nWell, Shank came to Alabama as a big kid back in 2012. On National Signing Day, the 6-foot-6 nose tackle said he weighed 360 pounds. On Tuesday, he said the weight was more like 385 pounds.\nEither way, he was getting a heavy dose of Alabama strength and conditioning coach Scott Cochran . Back in February 2012, Shank's called the routine the \"craziest workouts ever.\"\nThe first day was rough.\nHonestly, I almost died. But since then it's been great, it's been fun. I'm just enjoying the experience because if you look at 'Oh man, I gotta come in and work out every day,' you're not going to survive. You have to look at it, 'I have another day to get better. I have another chance to improve myself.' That's how I started looking at it from day one.\"\nAlphonse Taylor on his nickname, progression Alphonse Taylor on his nickname, progression\nMove ahead three years and Shank's well established on the offensive line. He's started all six games this season and weighs a more healthy 325 pounds. Cochran's workouts aren't so bad now that he's a veteran.\n\"Uh, I love it now,\" Shank said. \"It's all a part of the process. You just had to buy into it. Like, coming in as a freshman, that's just something new to you. It's something new to your body. It's something that you had to adapt to. And now I'm adapted to it. It's a part of my process, it's something I've bought into. And I'm all about the bigger, faster stronger. I'm all about the 'Bama way, so I'm really into it now.\"\nThat certainly helped Taylor win the starting right guard job after competing with Bradley Bozeman in the spring and into August.\n\"Shank has gone better and better every year,\" Saban said. \"I think it starts with his maturity and his approach in how he prepares and how he's learned to pay attention to detail. He's always been a very powerful guy, good run blocker, but balanced body control, pass protection, those kind of things is what he needed to work on.\n\"As he's gotten older, he's realized he has to do things a certain way to be successful. He's certainly matured as a competitor, very physical, loves to play and he's done a really nice job for us so far this year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:37:14.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
