Most of the things removed from a home near 31st Street and Lewis Avenue in northern Sioux Falls were construction materials. But a few vehicles were also towed away. \nAfter making court appearances, receiving citations and no action taken on his own, the city received a court order to remove the materials -- leaving Chad Carpenter to pay the bill. Carpenter has owned the home for almost three years, and he says on Tuesday, he lost thousands of dollars. \n\"There's a significant amount of violations here,\" LuAnn Ford with the City Health Department said. \nIt's a scene that looks similar to storm cleanup, but it was just one house. For four and a half hours, around a dozen dump trucks took away materials from the yard. Carpenter has received warnings and citations from the city to cleanup his yard for months. Two weeks ago, he received an order from the court to remove the materials or else the city will do it for him on his dime. \n\"I can't see paying $2,000 for a yard. They act like I had dead bodies here or something. It's building materials,\" Carpenter said. \nAccording to the city's website, having lumber and other construction materials outside can create a home for insects and rodents. It also devalues the property of the other homes in the neighborhood. \n\"It affects everyone when there's nuisance violations on a property. That's why the city has a code enforcement program to address issues like this. When a large number of nuisance violations are on a property, it affects an entire neighborhood and the city in general,\" Ford said. \nCarpenter, who works as a carpenter, says while he doesn't think the city handled it the right way, he does admit he collected too much stuff. \n\"If I got a good deal, I'd buy it and I got in over my head, and I just had too many projects going on at once and it was just me,\" Carpenter said. \nCarpenter was able to bring some of his materials into his garage, and a friend was able to tow away his racing car. His yard is clean now, but Carpenter doesn't know what's next for him. \n\"I didn't try to hurt nobody. I tried to better myself but I didn't. I tried to move forward and I went back,\" Carpenter said. \nFor more information about the codes and the enforcements you can visit the City's Website. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
