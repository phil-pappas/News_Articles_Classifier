It will soon become easier to get there, when Air India starts nonstop San Francisco-to-New Delhi service on Dec. 2, if you can call 16 hours of flying time covering 7,670 miles \"easy.\"\nA Boeing 777-200 LR will fly the route three times a week initially. This will be the only direct Pacific Ocean flight between North America and India.\nRepresentatives from India Tourism's Los Angeles office attended the Here and There Travel Fest , with runs through Sunday, Oct. 11, at the Oregon Convention Center, to spread the word. The show is an Oregonian Media Group event.\nIndia Tourism is looking at Oregon as a \"good market,'' according to show representative Sandhya Haridas, who comes from the far south of India but works in Los Angeles. She said Air India is part of Star Alliance, which makes getting between San Francisco and Portland easy on code-share partner United Airlines.\nShe also noted that India uses an eTourist Visa system, similar to the electronic travel authorization used by Australia, where U.S. passport holders can apply and pay online conveniently in the days before their trip. Can it get any easier to see the Taj Mahal?\nIndia Tourism doesn't operate at a travel show with a \"hard sell.'' Pretty much every traveler knows something about the sub-continent and has a good idea of whether they would like to see it or not. India Tourism instead works to get the word out about how easy India is to visit and lets the magic of the place take over from there.\nIndia Tourism was joined at the Portland show by California-based Sita Word Tours , which Haridas said is one of the best North American tour operators to the land of the tiger.\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": ["http://www.oregonianmediagroup.com/travel-show/", "http://blog.sfgate.com/cmcginnis/2015/09/29/air-india-confirms-sfo-delhi-flights/", "http://www.sitatours.com/"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:20:55.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
