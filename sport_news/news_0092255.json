The Aggies befuddled freshman quarterback Kilton Anderson. In his first start, he completed 10 of 20 passes for 112 yards. He threw three interceptions.\nBoise State also starts a freshman quarterback, but Brett Rypien & Co. will likely be far more difficult to stop. A four-star recruit coming out of high school, he is the nephew of former NFL quarterback Mark Rypien.\nSince taking over after early-season starter Ryan Finley broke his ankle against Idaho State on Sept. 18, Brett Rypien is completing 70 percent of his passes. He has thrown for seven touchdowns.\n\"He's done very well,\" Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said. \"I wouldn't call it a surprise, but you don't know what a freshman will do because you haven't seen him play. You haven't seen them get out there and actually play, so you never know how they will handle it.\"\nSaid Utah State coach Matt Wells: \"When you see some of the things he does, he's really good. … He can make all the throws. He's got a good head on his shoulders, he's very accurate and he's got a great supporting cast around him.\"\nAt Utah State, Rypien will try to keep producing against the best defense he's faced. One preseason publication ranked the Aggies' front seven among the top 10 in the country.\nCurrently, USU ranks 15th nationally in average rushing yards (102.2). The Aggies are 18th in total yards (297.4) despite the fact they have already played Utah and Washington — two Pac-12 teams.\n\"We've prided ourselves on stopping the run for some time,\" Ali'ifua said. \"It's not something we just decided, 'OK, this year we want to really focus on that. … We've built this program on having a very stout and solid defense, all the way back to when [current Seattle Seahawks linebacker] Bobby Wagner was here.\"\nThis season, Wells gives the credit to his players and first-year defensive coordinator Kevin Clune's ability to match their skills with his schemes.\n\"We've got good football players,\" Wells said. \"We've recruited well and we've developed them well. … When you recruit good players and you develop good players, usually you play pretty well.\"\nluhm@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @sluhm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:42:10.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
