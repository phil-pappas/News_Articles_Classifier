Manager takes fall for Nationals' demise 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Washington\nManager Matt Williams was fired by the Washington Nationals on Monday after a season in which the team went from World Series favorite to failing to make the playoffs.\nThe club announced the move a day after finishing the regular season barely above .500 at 83-79, second to the New York Mets in the NL East.\nWilliams is gone after only two seasons in his first job as a skipper in the majors. Last year, he was voted NL Manager of the Year after the Nationals finished with the best record in the league. In February, the Nationals exercised his 2016 contract option.\nBut he presided over a 2015 season filled with defeats, discord and a dugout dustup between NL MVP front-runner Bryce Harper and closer Jonathan Papelbon the day after the team was eliminated from playoff contention.\nWilliams said he had no idea of the extent of the skirmish until much later in the day. Even though he was, of course, in the dugout at the time, Williams said he hadn't been aware of exactly what happened â€” including that Papelbon grabbed Harper by the throat.\nThe Nationals also said Monday they will not renew the contracts of the seven members of Williams' staff: bench coach Randy Knorr , pitching coach Steve McCatty , hitting coach Rick Schu , third base coach Bobby Henley , first base coach Tony Tarasco , bullpen coach Matt LeCroy , and defensive coordinator Mark Weidemaier .\nAngels: Longtime Yankees executive Billy Eppler has been hired as general manager. The 40-year-old Eppler replaces interim GM Bill Stoneman, who took over after Jerry Dipoto quit his job at midseason following his latest disagreement with Mike Scioscia , the longest-serving manager in baseball, who will return in 2016.\nAthletics: The Oakland Athletics wanted to make sure they could keep David Forst in the front office after other clubs sought to hire him, so they promoted him to general manager Monday and elevated Billy Beane to executive vice president of baseball operations. Forst just completed his 16th year with the low-budget franchise and 12th as assistant GM. Beane had been GM since late 1997.\nBrewers: Only hitting coach Darnell Coles and third base coach Ed Sedar will return from the previous staff in 2016 under manager Craig Counsell . He was hired in May following the firing of predecessor Ron Roenicke . Pitching coach Rick Kranitz ; first base coach Mike Guerrero ; bench coach Jerry Narron ; bullpen coach Lee Tunnell ; and coach John Shelby will not have their contracts renewed.\nCardinals: Catcher Yadier Molina will try to play in the NL Division Series wearing a splint to protect his injured left thumb. He was hurt on Sept. 20 making a tag at the plate and hasn't played since then.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/67/8744446/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/67/8744446/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:53:06.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
