That is the question. \nLast week I answered that question poorly. \nThere were three games on last week’s schedule that I was torn about, Margaretta at home against St. Mary Central Catholic, Woodmore against Elmwood and St. Joseph Central Catholic at Crestline. \nI saw the case for and against each area team winning. SJCC and Woodmore were toss-up games between teams with identical records, while Margaretta, though an underdog, was at home against a team it defeated last season. \nI went with the upset, picking Margaretta. As it turned out, I missed it by just 44 points. I also went with SJCC to get its first win of the season but, knowing I was going heavy on local teams winning, I decided to go the other way with Woodmore. Wrong and wrong. \nThose games cost me greatly as I finished the week 7-for-10, and barely escaped a six-win week thanks to Michigan State’s miracle win over Michigan. \nThough my picks were less-than-stellar, four players nailed a perfect week. Fremont resident Dave Hartley, Clyde’s Scott Prunty and Catawba Island’s Jonathan Keegan each correctly predicted all of last week’s outcomes. News-Messenger sports correspondent Josh Morgret also registered a perfect week, which is why I’m not speaking to Josh. \nAnother 15 players correctly got 9-out-of-10, nearly all of whom missed out on either SJCC losing or Michigan’s punt-turned-catastrophe. \nIn all, 34 players beat Rich’s Picks last week, 19 tied my score of seven and five players finished with six or fewer correct. \nThanks to all for playing, particularly to those special six. What little self-esteem I have I owe to you. \nOn to Week 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:42:58.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
