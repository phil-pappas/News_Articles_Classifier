But there were some substitutes who shined, too. The most prominent were receiver Keshawn Martin, linebacker Jonathan Freeny and tackle Marcus Cannon. “That’s why you have depth,” coach Bill Belichick said Monday in a conference call. “That’s why you have as many good players as you can have because you never know when you’re going to need them. But when you need them, you need for them to answer the bell, and all three of those guys did a good job.” The Patriots acquired Martin and a sixth-round pick from the Houston Texans for a fifth-rounder on Sept. 16. The fourth-year receiver made his New England debut in Week Three, catching all three passes he was targeted for and turning them into 33 yards and a touchdown in a victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Patriots had their bye week after that, but it didn’t stymie Martin’s momentum in Dallas. The 5-foot-11, 194-pound Michigan State alum once again caught every pass thrown his way. This time there were two, good for 23 yards and a first down. With Aaron Dobson a surprising healthy scratch as the Patriots opted to go with just three full-time receivers, Martin made his third career start and played 50 of 59 offensive snaps (84.7 percent). That was just one snap less than Edelman. “Keshawn had an opportunity and I thought he stepped in there and did a good job,” Belichick said. “It wasn’t perfect — like everybody else — but he did a lot of positive things. I thought the catch he made on the in-cut there (for 16 yards) with Tom (Brady) kind of scrambling and extending the play a bit was a really good play.” Martin has five receptions in two games with the Patriots. He had six in 16 games last season. His career high is 22 receptions in 2013. It should be noted Martin was called for pass interference, negating a 33-yard reception by Danny Amendola. It came on a pick play and he’s not the first Patriot to get flagged for that illegal action. While Martin stepped up, Freeny stepped in. The Patriots were lauded for their aggressiveness and acumen when they acquired versatile linebacker Jon Bostic from the Chicago Bears in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick on Sept. 28. But Bostic was inactive Sunday, most likely due to a nagging ankle injury. So when Dont’a Hightower left the game with a rib injury in the first quarter and didn’t return, the Patriots turned to Freeny — along with longtime captain Jerod Mayo — to fill the linebacker breach. Page 2 of 2 - Freeny, who spent his first three seasons with the Miami Dolphins before signing with the Patriots in March, mainly contributed on special teams in the first three games. He didn’t play on defense at all in the season opener due to a defensive-back-heavy scheme and was on the field for 15 of 129 defensive snaps (11.6 percent) in Weeks Two and Three before playing 25 snaps against the Cowboys. “Dallas had a lot of two-receiver sets and some even one-receiver sets where they had three tight ends in the game or some two-receiver sets with a fullback and a tight end or two tight ends, so we were in some bigger personnel groups with three linebackers on the field instead of two,” Belichick said. “Some of that is just having an extra linebacker on the field, but also when High went out, Jonathan stepped in there and did a good job for us along with Jamie Collins] and Jerod,\" Belichick said. Freeny didn’t record a tackle, but he did recover a fumble forced by Collins in the fourth quarter. Cannon has been rotating with starting tackles Nate Solder (left) and Sebastian Vollmer (right) all season. He saw extensive action in a win over the Buffalo Bills in Week Two after Vollmer injured a finger and it was more of the same Sunday. Cannon, a fifth-round pick of the Patriots in 2011, played 40 snaps, including the entire second half after Solder suffered an elbow injury late in the second quarter that forced him out of the game for good. He was part of a unit that surrendered no sacks in the second half after allowing five in the opening 30 minutes. “Marcus stepped in there and, as he’s done many times in the past throughout his career, gave us a lot of quality plays,” Belichick said of Cannon, who has played at least 40 snaps in each of the past three games. “We definitely needed that. Certainly our protection in the second half and just our overall offensive efficiency was a lot better than in the first 20 minutes of the game or so.” By Rich Garven More Content Now The Bulletin By Rich Garven More Content Now Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 7:27 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:02:14.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
