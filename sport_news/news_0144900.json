South Carolina was struggling, and the gregarious and once innovative coach was a big reason why. Always one to do things his way, Spurrier believed he needed to step aside, and no one was going to change his mind. \nSpurrier resigned as Gamecocks coach Tuesday, resisting pleas from the university president and athletic director to stay through the season — accepting the harsh reality that the team’s awful first half was on him. \n“You can’t keep a head coach as long as I have (coached) when it’s heading in the wrong direction,” the 70-year-old coach said. \nSpurrier considered leaving several times during his 11 seasons at South Carolina, most recently after last year’s 6-6 regular season. But a win over Miami in the Independence Bowl re-energized him. \nThe Gamecocks, though, have struggled at 2-4 and are 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference for the first time in Spurrier’s 23 seasons in the league. \n“I’m responsible. I’m the head coach,” he said. “It’s time for me to get out of the way and let somebody else have a go at it.” \nSpurrier said he felt he needed to step down now because he doesn’t believe there is accountability with players if they know the coach won’t be back next year. He also said he would be a recruiting liability. \nSpurrier said it was unlikely he’d ever be a head coach in college again because of the recruiting aspect. He said he does hope to consult for a team one day. \nSpurrier had never had a losing season in 25 years as coach at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) or South Carolina. \n“I was the best coach for this job 11 years ago, but I’m not today,” he said. \nInterim head coach Shawn Elliott said his job was to help the team move forward. \n“Our team is not in shambles, as some might say,” he said after Spurrier left the podium. “Not sure the change is what they’ve needed, but the change is what they’ve got. Going to do everything we can to make the University of South Carolina proud of this football program.” \nAthletic director Ray Tanner said he would form a search committee and hire a firm to help identify candidates going forward. Tanner said Elliott would be a candidate to earn the full-time job. \nSouth Carolina will play at home against Vanderbilt (2-3, 0-2) on Saturday. \nFlorida: Starting quarterback Will Grier has been suspended for one year for violating the NCAA’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Grier, who gained 20 pounds in his first 18 months on campus, failed a drug test in the past two weeks. He said he took an over-the-counter supplement but did not specify which one, and he apologized to teammates before doing the same publicly. \nThe school said it will appeal the suspension. The Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC) are not facing a forfeiture of wins, and Grier won’t lose any eligibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:33:07.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
