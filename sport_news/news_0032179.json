The victory was Cirnu’s third in her last four matches. \nMillie Stretton and Maria Panaite each ended the weekend winning two straight matches, with Stretton defeating Mada Marianovic of Abilene Christian (6-4, 6-3) in the Black draw consolation final and Panaite downing Abilene Christian’s Alba Perny (6-4, 6-0) in the SMU draw consolation final. \nMeanwhile, Iva Bago beat UTEP’s Matilda Tench (6-4, 6-2) in an extra match of the Blue Singles draw. This was one of two wins for Bago on the day, as she and Stretton took down Erin Walker and Kaysie Harmsdorf from Abilene Christian 6-2 in the Red Doubles draw. \nAlso competing for K-State in doubles, Costamagna and Cirnu beat Louisiana Tech’s Alexandra Starkova and Zoe Chen 6-2 to earn their second win as doubles partners. \n“Liv and Iva both bounced back from yesterday’s tough losses to play great doubles and singles, while Millie and Maria both continued to show great improvements in their singles game,” Steinberg said. \n“Overall, we definitely improved as a team this weekend.” \nBago and Costamagna will be joined by Sara Castellano and Ana Garcia Navas at the ITA Central Regional Championships Oct. 15-18 at the Greenwood Tennis Center in Stillwater, Okla.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:01:11.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
