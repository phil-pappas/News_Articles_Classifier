I know Sticky (Stuart) is as well.” \nCroker looked forward to Sezer adding healthy competition to their incumbent halves combination – No.7 Sam Williams and Dally M Five-eighth of the Year Blake Austin. \n“I met Aidan so I know he is excited to get into it,” Croker said. \nWilliams was unfazed by Sezer’s arrival. \n“I am excited about the chance to challenge myself, learn about Aidan and his game and try and push each other so we can be in the best position we can be come round one,” Williams told reporters on Monday.
