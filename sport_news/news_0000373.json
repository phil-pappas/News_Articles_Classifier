The Warriors were up 27-21 and were looking to take a nine-point lead on a field goal, but the kick was missed, giving the Lobos one last chance. \nThe Lobos took the ball 80 yards in 10 plays in just 1:19, ending with a 28-yard Austin Apodaca touchdown pass to Dameon Gamblin and the PAT afterwards, giving the Lobos a 28-27 lead with 55 seconds to go. \nWarriors quarterback Ikaika Woolsey was intercepted with 10 seconds left, effectively ending the game. \nApodaca is the Lobos' backup quarterback behind Lamar Jordan. Apodaca was put in to march down the field due to his strong arm. He finished 6-10 for 70 yards and the game-winning touchdown. \nThe Lobos (4-3, 2-1) will travel to San Jose to take on the Spartans next week as the Warriors (2-5, 0-3) with take on the Wolf Pack. \nIt was an exciting weekend for the Mountain West Conference as the conference favorite, Boise State, fell to Utah State 52-26. The Aggies (4-2, 3-0) now take sole possession of first place in the Mountain division as the Broncos (5-2, 2-1) fall out of New Year's Six consideration. \nHere are the results of the other Mountain West games this past weekend: Fresno State (2-5, 1-3) 31, UNLV (2-5, 1-2) 28 \nThe Bulldog run offense was the difference in this close contest. The Bulldogs trailed 28-14 in the third quarter before giving the game over to their running backs. Marteze Waller carried the ball 21 times for 111 yards and two touchdowns and Kilton Anderson finished with 11 carries for 78 yards and two touchdowns to lead the running attack for the Bulldogs. \nThe Bulldogs will take on the Falcons next week as the Rebels will rest during their bye week. Colorado State (3-4, 1-2) 38, Air Force (3-3, 2-1) 23 \nThe Rams got their first signature win of the season over the Falcons. The Rams were led by sophomore quarterback Nick Stevens. He finished the day going 23-30 for 296 yards passing and three touchdowns. Stevens hit Joe Hansley for just three receptions, two of which were touchdown catches. Jasen Olden Jr. had a big game as well, finishing with 11 carries for 89 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe Rams will be on a bye next week, and the Falcons will welcome the Bulldogs. Wyoming (1-6, 1-2) 28, Nevada (3-4, 1-2) 21 \nThe Cowboys won their first game of the season behind quarterback Cameron Doffman and running back Brian Hill. Doffman finished 18-20 for 213 yards and three touchdowns. Hill had a monster game, finishing with 33 carries for 188 yards. The Cowboys finally showed they could generate offense outside of Hill with the emergence of the passing game. \nThe Cowboys will look to continue their winning ways in Week 8 on the Smurf Turf against the Broncos, and the Wolf Pack will host the Warriors. San Diego State (4-3, 3-0) 30, San Jose State (3-4, 2-2) 7 \nEven though the Spartans came in with the conference's leading rusher, it was the Aztecs' lead back who came away with the victory and the big game.

He also added three receptions for 55 yards and a receiving touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:08:00.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
