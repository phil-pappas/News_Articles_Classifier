They returned the aircraft to US control and there were no injuries, Warren said.\nThen on October 19, a different Predator \"crashed\" in southern Turkey, Warren said. Local media have said it came down in Hatay.\n\"The aircraft experienced mechanical failure. The Air Force in this case maintained positive control of the aircraft and brought it down safely in an unpopulated area,\" Warren said.\nAgain, the aircraft was returned to US control. Both incidents are under investigation.\nThe United States is leading a 60-plus member coalition targeting Islamic State jihadists in Iraq and Syria and has been carrying out frequent warplane and drone raids for more than a year.\nTurkey has permitted the United States to use a base at Incirlik in southern Turkey to conduct strikes against ISIS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:31:14.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
