Lincoln is far removed from the team that went 11-2 in 2013. But the Wolves at least are still in the playoff picture heading into the final three weeks of the regular season. \nLincoln (3-4, 2-2 4A-1 Conference) faces its biggest challenge tonight at Shiloh Christian (4-2, 3-1), which beat Gentry 42-14 last week. Lincoln likely needs another victory in its remaining games against Shiloh Christian, Gentry, and conference leader Prairie Grove to advance to the postseason \nGive Lincoln coach Don Harrison, his staff, and the Wolves credit for showing improvement after beginning the season with consecutive losses. Harrison doesn't see the speed or athletic ability on the field that he had at Newport, but he's molded together a bunch of battlers who've shown they can win tight games. \nThat was evident last week when the Wolves held on for a 27-26 victory over Huntsville. \n\"Our kids fought to the very end,\" Harrison said following the game. \"We preach attitude and effort all the time. They kept their heads up and gutted it out.\" \nLincoln will need plenty of attitude and effort to beat Shiloh Christian on its home field tonight. But fans expecting an easy victory for the Saints may be surprised at the fight in the Wolves this season. \nRICK'S PICK: Shiloh Christian \nOther games involving teams from Northwest Arkansas (selections are capitalized). \nCLASS 7A/6A \nSPRINGDALE HAR-BER at Fort Smith Southside \nBENTONVILLE at Rogers High \nFORT SMITH NORTHSIDE at Springdale High \nRogers Heritage at FAYETTEVILLE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:39:08.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
