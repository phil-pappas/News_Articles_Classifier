It also comes amid concerns about the structure of the tour calendar, particularly at the end of the season, and about the ability of players to stay healthy, despite the 2009 expansion of the off-season, which is now at eight weeks.

The one thing I don’t want to do is compress it so players are playing more in a lesser period of time, because that’s not healthy.” Simon is supportive of the WTA’s on-court coaching initiative, which has drawn mixed reviews. He also said the tour should continue to examine the so-called grunting issue, which has been polarizing, but he suggested that “it is best addressed in the development years.” After the WTA’s rapid expansion in Asia, chiefly in China, Simon sounds ready to focus on other regions. “We need to make sure we respect the region and don’t oversaturate it,” he said of the Asia-Pacific region. “We’ll continue to look at new opportunities around the world where it makes sense, but this truly is a global tour, and I think we need to have balance. You need North America. You need Asia. You need Europe. You need to be looking into some other markets, because there are obviously some big ones out there that we don’t have a lot of tennis in — South America, and India is another.” Simon’s arrival provides tennis — a sport hamstrung by its fragmented power structure — with a clear opportunity for greater cooperation on thorny issues like conflicts in commercial sponsorship and the Davis Cup and Fed Cup national team events. The major leadership posts in the professional game have all changed hands recently. Chris Kermode, a Briton, took over as head of the men’s tour in November 2013, and Dave Haggerty, an American, became president of the International Tennis Federation last month. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:23:54.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
