Will Allen, Tre Mason St. Louis Rams running back Tre Mason carries the ball against the Pittsburgh Steelers during an NFL game on Sept. 27, 2015, in St. Louis. (AP Photo) Comments \nMaybe the most telling detail of how the St. Louis Rams plan to use running back Todd Gurley now that he's healthy came in the third quarter of last week's game against the Arizona Cardinals. Gurley broke a run up the middle for 23 yards. Then the Rams handed him the ball on the next three snaps before throwing a touchdown pass. \n\"I think what everyone expected was, after he broke the first long one where we had the celebration and the delay, that you expected to see Tre go in,\" St. Louis coach Jeff Fisher said , \"and (Gurley) said he was fine. He goes, 'No I'm going. I'm going to finish this drive.' That's a really good indication of where he is right now.\" \n\"Tre\" is former Auburn star Tre Mason . And he didn't go in for Gurley at all in the second half. \nAt halftime against Arizona, Gurley had four carries for 2 yards and Mason had two carries for minus-1. Gurley finished the game with 19 rushing attempts for 146 yards (even though his first run of the second half lost 4 yards). Mason finished with two carries for minus-1 yard. \nLast season, Mason was St. Louis' leading rusher and made the NFL All-Rookie team. But the Rams used the 10 th pick in the 2015 NFL Draft to select Gurley out of Georgia, even though he had knee surgery in November after an injury ended his collegiate career early. \nGurley missed the first two games of the season before making his debut with 9 yards on six carries in St. Louis' 12-6 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sept. 27. Last week, he started against the undefeated Cardinals, who had the biggest scoring differential in the NFL through the first three games. Gurley gouged Arizona for 106 rushing yards in the fourth quarter of the Rams' 24-22 victory. \n\"I told you last week that he was really close and he was,\" Fisher said , \"and this week he proved it.\" \nRELATED: NFL WEEK 5 SCHEDULE, TV, ODDS \nFisher said Gurley had been everything the Rams hoped he would be, even while recovering from knee surgery. \n\"He's learned the offense. He knows exactly what to do. Learning hasn't been a problem,\" Fisher said at his Monday press conference. \"Workload has not been a problem. He's done all of the extra things. He's that complete back. That's the reason we drafted him, because we knew he was like that. All of the information we got out of the University of Georgia was all true. This is the kind of young man that he is. He's a real pro.\" \nSo where does that leave Mason? \nIn one way, he's ahead of where he was last year. In his rookie season, Mason entered the fifth week of the campaign without having played a snap for the Rams. But he ended up being St. Louis' leading rusher in each of the remaining 12 games on his way to 765 yards for the season. \nBut he didn't have Gurley to contend with for playing time last year. \nLike Gurley, Mason missed St. Louis' 2015 opener. He had a hamstring injury. Mason started the next two games, but got only 16 carries, good for 42 yards in a pair of losses. \nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE \nThe Rams visit the undefeated Green Bay Packers at noon CDT Sunday. The Packers are preparing their defense for Gurley. \n\"I think the biggest thing, particularly with ball-carriers or quarterbacks, you pay attention to their style,\" Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said . \"We have an opinion of his running style and really conceptually what they're doing on offense. He's going to be a big challenge, particularly with the commitment they have to the outside zone. They run that very well, and when you have a big, strong, instinctive runner like Gurley, that definitely plays to his strength. He'll be a big challenge for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:41:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
