In the vein of All The Presidents Men and The Insider, it is the incredible true story of Mary Mapes (played by Cate Blanchet), an award-winning CBS News Journalist and Dan Rathers producer, who broke the Abu-Ghraib prison abuse story, among others. The film chronicles the story Mapes and Rather uncovered that a sitting US president may have been AWOL from the United States National Guard for over a year during the Vietnam War. When the story blew up in their face, the ensuing scandal ruined Dan Rathers career, nearly changed a US Presidential election, and almost took down all of CBS News in the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:05:25.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
