She rose to fifth place on the second day, with a two-day total of 137 after an impressive 6 birdies and just one bogie. \nShe dropped back again on the third day, finishing at 7th after firing 6 birdies, 1 bogie and 2 double bogies, carding 69 and a three-day total of 206. \nOn the final day of competition, Tseng managed to take the lead at one point, scoring an eagle on the 5th hole and a birdie on the 8th without a bogie in the front nine. \nHowever, she suffered a setback when she hit a double bogie on the 10th hole, but went on to fire birdies on the 12th, 17th and 18th holes to end with a daily score of 68 and four-day total of 274. \nThompson, who finished the final round one stroke ahead Tseng, won the title in the tournament, which carried a total cash prize of US$2 million. \nBefore the final round of the tournament, Thompson, who was one stroke behind the leading player, said her plan was to make birdies, and she did exactly that. \n\"It's very satisfying,\" said Thompson. \"I always look forward to coming back to South Korea and playing in front of these amazing fans, and I love Sky 72 ... I always look forward to it, but getting a win, it means so much,\" she said. \nMeanwhile, for Tseng, who was the world's top female golfer for 109 weeks from February 2011 to March 2013, her second-place finish was proof that she could shake off her downturn. \nIt was the third time this year that Tseng finished a tournament in second place, and the third time in the top-five in her last four starts. Her last win was at the Kia Classic in March 2012. \n\"Just being back where I am. It's better where I am, I think,\" said Tseng. \"I'm just looking forward to win. I came to Asia for these five weeks and looking for a win. I know every week is getting close, and next week in Taiwan, it would be a great win in Taiwan.\" \nShe was referring to the Fubon LPGA Taiwan Championship, the Taiwan leg of the LPGA tour, which is scheduled for Oct. 22-25 in New Taipei. \nTo realize her hopes of win, Tseng will have to beat seven of the world's top 10 players. \nTseng, now 55th in the Rolex World Rankings, won the Taiwan tournament in 2011.
