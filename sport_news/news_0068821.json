QBs at USU, BYU and Utah have been either a revolving door, a story of whose up next, or dramatic performances on a national stage — and we're only a month into the season.\nUpcoming Games BYU Football BYU football stats & schedule East Carolina @ BYU Lavell Edwards Stadium, Provo Oct. 10, 5:30 p.m. 2 Days 8 Hrs 23 Mins 7 Secs Utah Football Utah football stats & schedule Cal @ Utah Rice-Eccles Stadium, Salt Lake City Oct. 10, 8:00 p.m. 2 Days 10 Hrs 53 Mins 57 Secs USU Football USU football stats & schedule USU @ Fresno State Bulldog Stadium, Fresno Oct. 10, 8:30 p.m. 2 Days 11 Hrs 23 Mins 23 Secs More Coverage Utah notebook: Fake punt return catching on elsewhere SUU pushes forward despite ‘difficult’ departure of Gary Crowton BYU football notebook: Running back position looking healthy entering game against East Carolina Utes back in the college football spotlight BYU football: This Nephi played a role in East Carolina starting a football program Utah Utes football: The California Golden Bears in 6 numbers Utes pleased with quality of Tuesday's practice This week is all about quarterbacks. Praise them, be wary of them, let them surprise or disappoint, but they will be front and center come this college football weekend on the local scene.\nBack in August the QB position was so much a part of the spotlight, and some say it was the big story of the season. You had the return of BYU ’s Taysom Hill, USU’s Chuckie Keeton and final hurrah for Ute Travis Wilson. These were seniors, bedrock pillars of their respective teams. They had experience, meaningful resumes and were on their way.\nBoy, how things have turned. Wilson’s the last man standing.\nThe big show will be at Rice-Eccles Stadium Saturday, where one of the nation’s top NFL prospects, Jared Goff of the University of California, faces Utah’s Wilson, whose comeback from injury has helped launch the Utes to a No. 5 ranking.\nHand it to Wilson. He’s had the wind in his face his entire career. He’s been banged up, turned end on end, endured injury and rehabilitation. He’s been benched, disrespected, challenged and retrained. He’s been criticized from A to Z. He’s been through more coordinators than any quarterback in the country. He’s as resilient as the cast of “The Walking Dead,” surviving one issue after another.\nDeceptive with his feet, dangerous with his speed, he’s settling in with Aaron Roderick designs, working confidently with a full toolbox. He’s playing like a seasoned senior. Wilson has the luxury of a workhorse running back in Devontae Booker. This makes him very effective and he doesn’t have to be Superman on every drive.\nThen there’s Kent Myers at Utah State. Wasn’t this guy like fourth or fifth string last year when called upon after Aggie QBs were falling like dominoes? I thought Colorado State would go into Logan and eke out a close victory last week because USU’s offense was struggling. Wrong. I underestimated Wells’ staff in reloading at that position. Should have learned that lesson in 2014.\nMyers chewed up CSU’s defense. He’s become Mr. Answer. A year ago Wells dialed his number and Myers delivered, all the way to an impressive bowl performance. He didn’t do all the dirty work, but when it counted, he stepped into the fray and didn’t blink.\nAgainst the Rams, Myers set the USU rushing record by a QB for a single game — and did so by halftime. It was storybook stuff. His nearly 200 yards rushing was Taysom Hill-esque, Keeton-esque. Or we should just leave it as Myers-esque. He’s got the feet, the breakaway speed and the athleticism to make pundits second-guess if Keeton should have been starting before he twisted his knee. That’s kind of football sacrilege, but Myers looked that good. His record is 6-1 as a starter, and that’s nothing to sneeze at.\nIn Provo, the Tanner Mangum show continues. He’s not supposed to be this poised and this good, this early. Back in June he was in Chile wearing a white shirt and tie while all the defensive linemen, linebackers and DBs he’s facing each week were pumping iron, running wind sprints, gulping down special nutrition dietary supplements under the direction of highly paid professionals. Mangum’s first priority was beating his companion to the showers at 6 a.m. and trying to share his faith.\nMangum has shown impressive pocket presence. He’s got big-play capabilities and a cannon for an arm. For the most part, he’s very accurate and became an instant national figure since his first Hail Mary in Lincoln, Nebraska. He’s still being fed bits and pieces of Robert Anae’s offense and hasn’t had the luxury of a seasoned running back. He just started breaking in Adam Hine before an injury forced a reset.\nWe just saw Mangum set school records for a freshman QB at BYU for completions and passing yards in one game Saturday against UConn. His “break-in period” came against Michigan’s No. 2-ranked defense; Boise State’s No. 7 defense; and UConn’s No. 24. Imagine what he’ll be like when he’s in shape and running the entire playbook.\nThese are great QB stories to follow. They’re bringing drama every week.\nI’ll also throw SUU’s Ammon Olsen into the mix. He’s had an incredible career so far in Cedar City for the Thunderbirds, evidenced by the blowout of Weber State he helped pile up in Ogden. Olsen has passed for nearly 1,000 yards and five TDs.\nYes, the QBs are front and center. They always are.\nSomebody pass the popcorn.\nEMAIL: dharmon@deseretnews.com .\nTWITTER: Harmonwrites", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:07:18.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
