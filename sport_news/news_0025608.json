As a Warrior, O’Neil was an offensive force of speed, power and will, burying 46 goals in her final two seasons on the high school soccer field. Now O’Neil’s job is to make sure the other team doesn’t score. “Whatever the team needs, so I’m back there,” O’Neil said, with a familiar quick laugh. The former flashy forward is now a sturdy, dependable center back for the University of New Hampshire women’s soccer team. She is also a senior captain. “It showed that my teammates had a lot of trust in me which is really nice of them,” O’Neil said. O’Neil spent her freshman season at San Diego State and enrolled at UNH for the second semester. She led UNH in scoring as a sophomore and played primarily in the midfield as a junior until an injury to center back Jackie Feraco prompted coach Steve Welham to move O’Neil one line further back. “KO is a very versatile soccer player and we’ve played her as a forward, we’ve played her as a holding (midfielder) and now we’ve played her this last year as a central defender and she’s been lights out there for us,” Welham said. “She’s one of our highest performers every match. We have an analytical statistical company we work with and she’s always one of the highest performers.” O’Neil will graduate next May after majoring in both international business and finance. She earned a spot on the America East Academic Honor Roll in both 2013 and 2014. She also has one more year of athletic eligibility but has not yet decided if she’ll play soccer after this season. “I’m going to make a decision after season,” O’Neil said. “I’m just trying to focus on this season and not get too sidetracked. If anything, if I stayed, it will be to (work on) a master’s degree.” UNH is 6-6-3 and currently atop the America East Conference with a 4-1 mark. UNH, which hosted Maine on Thursday, finishes the regular season on the road with games at University of Maryland Baltimore County on Sunday and then at Hartford next Thursday. The America East tournament starts Thursday, Oct. 29, with quarterfinal matches. Last season the Wildcats won the AE tournament for the first time to secure its first-ever NCAA tournament bid, where they lost to powerful Connecticut, 2-0. “That’s definitely the first goal, to win the conference again, and then to win (the program’s) first NCAA game,” O’Neil said. “The game that stands out in my mind was the NCAA game last year against UConn,” Welham said. “Kirsten was outstanding. She won everything that came her way and just a calming influence. She was great in the America East final (against Hartford). Those big games come around we know we can count on her.” “She’s very strong and definitely a solid block in the back,” said Feraco, who now plays side-by-side with O’Neil. “And as a teammate she always brings the team up; always positive, always trying to keep our spirits up.” Playing center back can be a thankless position. Mistakes lead to goals and it happened to O’Neil as time was winding down in the first half of last Thursday’s 4-2 win against University of Massachusetts at Lowell in front of a sparse crowd of 129 at Cowell Stadium. O’Neil had possession of the ball and was looking for passing options out of the back. Lowell’s Katelyn Veiras approached aggressively, took the ball away from O’Neil and scored the tying goal. “Those things will happen. That’s definitely my first experience with that happening as a center back,” O’Neil said. “That hasn’t happened before but my teammates told me that in that position things like that will happen and it’s how you react. We came out with a 4-2 win and that was awesome.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:36:52.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
