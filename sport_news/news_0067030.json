(Jack Boland/Postmedia Network) Farrell visits Red Sox day after announcing he has cancer \nTests performed Thursday display that Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell is in remission from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the team announced. \nFarrell, 53, completed chemotherapy treatments earlier this month. He took a leave from the Red Sox on Aug. 14 when doctors discovered the cancer while performing hernia surgery. \n\"I am extremely thankful for the outpouring of support I have received from the Red Sox, my family, friends, and fans throughout this process,\" Farrell said in a statement. \"I am also especially thankful for the talented doctors who cared for me in Detroit and here at (Mass General Hospital). I look forward to getting back to work and bringing another championship back to Boston.\" \nThe Red Sox announced earlier this month that Farrell would return to his post when healthy. Bench coach Torey Lovullo served as interim manager in Farrell's absence and recently decided to return to the club in his previous role for the 2016 campaign. \n\"We are thrilled to hear the great news about John today,\" Dave Dombrowski, Red Sox President of Baseball Operations said in a statement. \"Foremost, we are extremely happy for him and his family, knowing what he has gone through over the past two months. We all admire him for his strength and courage, and look forward to having him back as our manager.\" Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:19:45.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
