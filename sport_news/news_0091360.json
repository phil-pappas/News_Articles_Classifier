Jackson Memorial Bridge unites. The towering, subtly serpentine structure over the Columbia River connects Oregon and Washington, carrying Interstate 205's flood of traffic high above the states' borders.\nFor Brian Fletcher, a longtime Tidewater tugboat captain, the bridge is a dividing line.\nDownstream of the bridge, the Columbia River grows chaotic. There are boats, ships, bridge lifts and deliveries to think about.\nHeading the other way, gliding up the Columbia Gorge at a steady 7 mph, those distractions disappear once past the bridge.\nFletcher, 55, has spent most of his life around the water, shuffling wood chips, scrap metal and wheat between the Portland region and upstream ports as far away as Lewiston, Idaho. The water is where he's always made his living.\nOn long trips back down river, working on 15-day rotations, the bridge serves as a reminder of the life paused while away. Fletcher says he thinks about the cars overhead. From the water, he hears them swishing between the two states and wonders where their drivers are going.\n\"You're isolated,\" he says. \"You have to realize the world isn't stopping because you're on a boat for 15 days. Everybody's going to work, going back and forth, all the things we do every day.\"\nFletcher started his career in 1979 while the bridge was being built, watching its progress from the water. He was a deckhand back then, doing the kind of unseen hard work that makes the economy move every day.\nHe saw the bridge's segments come together, piece by piece. The builders used a European cantilever construction style that was relatively new in the United States and didn't impede river traffic during construction.\nAfter building mammoth piers in the river, bridge workers topped them with 592 precast concrete segments weighing 120 to 190 tons each. They were moved down the Columbia by barge and lifted into place by heavy cranes. One of those cranes toppled into the river during a high windstorm on Dec. 2, 1980, killing two bridge workers.\nFletcher was luckier when he fell into the water one day and was fished out by a team of bridge ironworkers.\nOnce built, the bridge gradually blended into Fletcher's consciousness. It's the perfect bridge for a tugboat captain: Wide, tall, and out of everybody's way.\n\"I don't bother the motorists,\" he says. \"And they don't bother me.\"\nAnd because the pedestrian/bike path runs down the bridge's middle, he never has to deal with those pesky, lean-over-the-edge salutations from the spitters.\nWhen the bridge was being built, Fletcher remembers wondering: Why are they putting it all the way out there? And yet now, the bridge has been subsumed by the region's growth.\n\"Looking back over 30 odd years on the river, I got to see a lot of the landscape changing,\" he says. \"The face of the river has changed so much.\n\"I should've taken more pictures.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:33:22.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
