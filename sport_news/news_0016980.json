You gonna be running things ’bout the time you a senior. \nGalloway-Velazquez: ’Preciate it man. \nIf two young men who just squared off on a field of play can show that kind of respect when it’s over, there’s hope for the world, folks. \nThat gorgeous weather we had last Friday was also a boost to my picking. I was 24-2, which lifted the record to 156-37, 80.1 percent. There were two bonus wins in there, rescheduled rainout games where Union beat Rocky Point Trask and North Moore beat South Davidson after I had originally picked both to win. \nPine Forest at Cape Fear \nI was worried about a letdown for Cape Fear after the big win at Seventy-First. But then I remembered Colt assistant coach Joe Grates is married to Pine Forest assistant principal Kari Grates, so that’s not happening after they’ve been picking at each other all week. Hope you still have a comfy couch for Friday night coach. Earl's pick: Cape Fear 28, Pine Forest 14 \n\nLee County at Gray’s Creek \nLee is fighting for a decent playoff seed. Gray’s Creek is fighting to keep pace with Terry Sanford in the Cape Fear Valley 3-A. I’ll take the home team. Earl's pick: Gray’s Creek 29, Lee County 22 \n\nSeventy-First at Overhills \nDon’t count this Falcons team out. It is far too good to go quietly into the night in the final weeks of the regular season. Earl's pick: Seventy-First 35, Overhills 12 \n\nE.E. Smith at South View \nSmith has to scrap its way to a piece of the last automatic playoff berth in the Mid-South 4-A. It should get closer with a win over South View. Earl's pick: E.E. Smith 32, South View 12 \n\nWestover at Douglas Byrd \nHas Douglas Byrd really turned a corner or is this just smoke and mirrors? Tonight’s game will be a good yardstick. Earl's pick: Douglas Byrd 22, Westover 20 \n\nTerry Sanford at Southern Lee \nAbout the only thing standing in Terry Sanford’s way now is a showdown with Gray’s Creek — and, of course, a dose of overconfidence. Earl's pick: Terry Sanford 30, Southern Lee 8 \nLumberton 29, Hoke County 20 Richmond Senior 39, Purnell Swett 6 Western Harnett 14, Smithfield-Selma 12 Fairmont 18, South Columbus 16 Red Springs 32, West Columbus 7 Whiteville 31, St. Pauls 8 East Columbus 22, South Robeson 21 Clinton 30, Union 8 East Bladen 29, Rocky Point Trask 12 Wallace-Rose Hill 32, Midway 7 West Bladen 29, Pender 13 Warsaw Kenan 27, Lakewood 14 Albemarle 17, North Moore 16 Trinity Christian 27, Village Christian 16 South Wake Homeschool 24, Fayetteville Christian 18 Harrells Christian 24, Raleigh Word of God 16 \nScholastic sports editor Earl Vaughan Jr. can be reached at vaughane@fayobserver.com or 486-3519.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:24:17.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
