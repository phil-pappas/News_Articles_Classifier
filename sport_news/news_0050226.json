Their physicality on defense is pretty good.” \nBut, the Oaks-Mission squad isn’t as big up front on the offensive line as it has been the past few years, the coach said. \nEngland said he’s hoping his Mustangs (2-3) will build on last week’s 54-8 rout of Welch. \nWhatever the Mustangs do the remainder of the season will depend largely on the production of their freshmen and sophomores. \nDuring the triumph against Welch, freshmen skill players scored almost all the points. The lone exception was sophomore Bradley Crawford, who also found paydirt. \n“Most of our skill players are young,” England explained. “It’s been a joy to see (freshman) Sheldon Woodward grab the runningback position by the horns. Jerrell Martin and Brad Crawford all bring something to the table at that position. Brad is our backup quarterback (behind freshman Travian Weems) and Sheldon could probably play some quarterback so, so we have some options.” \nWeems continues to grow into his role as the triggerman for the Mustang offense. \n“He’s had a baptism under fire,” said England. “His numbers have been a little better each week.” \nOverall, the Mustangs’ ability to utilize its speed and athleticism to attack the edges has forced opposing defenses to spread out, he added. \nTwo of WCS’ key seniors have been linemen Sam Phillips and Jacob Pate. \n“Sam really helps carry our offense and defensive lines,” England said. \nSenior Dusty Shull has made two major impacts — with his work at defensive end and with his foot. \n“He’s punted the ball really well,” said England. “He’s allowed us to flip the field at times. … His punting has been phenomenal.” \nA Mustang stalwart who may not be available this week is lineman Arron Holcomb, who is still recovering from injury. \n“We’re kind of waiting for clearance,” explained England. \nFriday’s outcome could have much to do with WCS’ postseason opportunities. \nThe Mustangs are ranked No. 4 in the Oklahoma Christian Secondary Athletic Association. With only four teams advancing to the postseason, WCS has very little room for a major stumble. \n“It will probably come down to our game with Immanuel Lutheran. They’re No. 5,” said England. “They’ll be here (in Bartlesville) in three weeks. That will be a real big week.” \nThe one constant for the remainder of the season will be trying to play at a level to honor Hamm, England said. \n“He was such a loved guy, a dynamic guy,” England said about Hamm, a junior who had started at runningback and linebacker. “His dad spoke at the memorial service last Saturday and he said that if God raised Ben and he sat up in his coffin the first thing he would say is, ‘Did we win?’ He hated to lose at anything.” \nEngland recalled a preseason team party in which he and Hamm battled each other in Ping Pong. \n“I got the best of him in one game and he didn’t like that,” said England. “He was such a competitor.” \nEngland said the sad events of the past three weeks have helped his players put football in perspective and helped in building a team culture.
