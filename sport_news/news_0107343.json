Senior running back Travis Dean gained 243 yards and scored three touchdowns. With two games left in the regular season, Dean has already rushed for 1,331 yards and 16 touchdowns. \n“We don’t talk a lot about records, but for him it’s a career high and with each game he gets closer and closer to a lot of different records,” Kelley said. \nEven with Dean’s success, Kelley noted he strives for a balanced playbook by keeping a run-to-pass ratio around 60-40. Junior quarterback Devin Masek has passed for 965 yards and 12 touchdowns, with only four interceptions, and has also picked up 284 yards rushing and five scores. \nMasek threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns against Boonville, and also ran for a pair of scores. Kelley plans to continue a balanced attack tonight in order to find success against Mexico’s stingy defense. \nThe Bulldogs — ranked No. 9 in Class 4 — have won three in a row and are coming off a 54-14 NCMC rampage at Kirksville last week. Mexico’s defense has shut out four opponents this season and surrendered just 48 points. \n“They’re really good,” Kelley said. “We’re going to have to make sure that we get them off the line of scrimmage and hopefully use our speed to our advantage. But you know it’s definitely a very tough task running against their defense.” \nPart of the Hornets’ success last week came from their time of possession in key moments of the game. After giving up a score as a result of a turnover on the previous series, Fulton’s second possession of the second half took almost five minutes off the clock. \nKelley knows time of possession will be especially important tonight. Of its 293 offensive plays this season, Mexico has only attempted 23 passes. \nKarsten Ekern, a 6-foot, 195-pound senior, leads the Bulldogs in rushing with 1,058 yards (9.0 average) and 16 touchdowns, while fellow senior D’Milo Nunnelly (5-11, 183) has gained 383 yards (6.3 avg.) and scored five times. \nSenior Spencer Thomas (6-0, 160) has rushed for 221 yards and three touchdowns, while sophomore Avion Williams (5-9, 175) has 188 yards and three scores. \n“It’s no secret that they line up to run the ball,” Kelley said. “They have a lot of motion with the double wings. They’re going to try to get the ball to Nunnelly or Karsten. \n“In a lot of their games they don’t put up huge numbers, score-wise, but they put up huge numbers yard-wise just because they are grinding it out. They have the seven-, eight-, nine-minute drives and get 3, 4, 5 yards each play.” \nFulton remains in second place in the Class 3 District 6 standings with 46.63 points. Blair Oaks (7-0) — ranked second in the state — is in first place with 50.62 points. Owensville (4-3) and Southern Boone (4-3) follow the Hornets in third and fourth place, respectively, with 37.98 and 36.14. \nFulton at Mexico - Updates on Twitter: @FultonSunSports .
