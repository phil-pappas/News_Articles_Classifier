The orange-clad Astros now advance to the AL Divison Series, where they will face the defending AL champion Royals. Game 1 is Thursday night in Kansas City. Keuchel worked 16 scoreless innings against New York in the regular season, and the bearded 20-game winner was just as tough pitching on three days' rest for the first time in his career. He struck out seven while walking one. Rasmus sent Masahiro Tanaka's first pitch of the second inning soaring into deep right field. Gomez, who only had five plate appearances after missing nearly two weeks with a strained chest muscle in mid-September, connected on the first offering of the fourth. American League hits leader Jose Altuve had an RBI single off Dellin Betances in the seventh. Luke Gregerson pitched a quick ninth for a save. capecodtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:25:39.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
