The Bengals won 27-24 in overtime. happened. Anxiety is a feeling likely shared by fans as well after the Seahawks fell to 2-3 with a surprising meltdown in the fourth quarter and overtime in a 27-24 loss to the Bengals. Adding to the nervousness is that Arizona rebounded from last week’s home loss to the Rams to beat the Lions in Detroit, 42-17, six days after Detroit almost stole a win at CenturyLink Field. Arizona is 4-1 and back to holding a two-game lead on the Seahawks. And though it’s early and the Seahawks overcame a three-game deficit to catch the Cardinals last season, there’s not much evidence to suggest Arizona will collapse. The Seahawks, though, have to fix themselves first, and there were plenty of flaws Sunday, as our grades reveal. Like everything about this game, there was a lot of good until there suddenly was almost nothing but bad. After a week of criticism, the offensive line (with a lineup that remained the same as it has been all season) played some of its best football early in the game, helping Thomas Rawls gain 169 of what was a season-high 200 yards rushing for the Seahawks. Players said blocking on outside zone plays was markedly better. Quarterback Russell Wilson hit 11 of 15 passes through three quarters for 176 yards and a 106.5 passer rating, and the Seahawks had 338 yards entering the fourth quarter. But in the final 15 minutes and overtime the offense was non-existent, with just 27 yards on 10 plays in the fourth quarter and 32 on nine in overtime. Rawls didn’t get a carry on either of the two overtime series, which was somewhat mystifying. Wilson was sacked twice on 10 attempts in the fourth quarter and overtime after being sacked just twice in the first three quarters. Through three quarters, the biggest offensive mistake came when Wilson threw an interception in the third quarter when he tried to force a pass to Jimmy Graham in double-coverage. Graham, though, was never targeted again, going the final 37:38 of the game without a target. He finished with three receptions on five targets for 30 yards, which won’t do anything to quiet the talk about how the team is using him. The Seahawks defense held an offense that had been averaging seven yards per play to 5.3. And they held a passing offense that was averaging an NFL-best 10.2 per attempt to 6.5. And the defense also came up with its first interception (by Earl Thomas at the goal line in the second quarter) and a forced fumble returned for a touchdown in the third quarter. But it wasn’t enough, as the Bengals shifted from their big-play mode early in the game to dinking and dunking down the field and converting in the red zone. Cincinnati quarterback Andy Dalton was 10 of 11 for 105 yards in the fourth quarter with a passer rating of 136.7 and then 3 of 4 in overtime for 30 yards. The Bengals also gained 71 yards rushing on 15 carries in the fourth quarter and overtime in scoring on four of five possessions — two touchdowns and two field goals. Safety Earl Thomas said there was some uncommon miscommunication in the back end that led to the early Bengals touchdown and some of the big gains late. “We were off,” Thomas said. “We wasn’t in sync.” The breakdowns at the end seemed shared, but Cary Williams had a noticeably tough day. First, he was taken off duty of covering A.J. Green, as the Seahawks made the uncommon move of having Richard Sherman shadow Green instead of just lining up on the left side. Then Williams had a pass-interference penalty called that keyed Cincinnati’s drive that tied the score late. Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert also had eight receptions for 90 yards and two touchdowns (one coming against Kam Chancellor). Five of Eifert’s receptions and 59 yards came in the fourth quarter and overtime, pretty much equally beating Seattle’s safeties and linebackers.
