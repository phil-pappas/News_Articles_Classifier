Sevier County boasts a fast-paced spread offense, led by Vanderbilt quarterback commitment Deuce Wallace. The Smoky Bears average 37.3 points per game. Morristown West, led by star safety Calvin Smith, has a sturdy defense that has surrendered just 5.9 points per game. Expect to see the Trojans use the passing game to open opportunities for Chattanooga running back commitment DeAndre Delaney. Sevier County has turned in a handful of spotty defensive efforts this season, but has improved as it has become healthier. Defensive tackle Desmond Pancotto (knee) is expected to return for the Smoky Bears, whose run of five consecutive district championships ended in their regular-season finale in 2014. They’ve had a year to let that feeling simmer.\nPrepXtra Pick: Sevier County 31, Morristown West 28\nLast Week: 28-8 (77.8 percent); Overall: 239-70 (77.4)\nNick Carboni’s Pick\nMorristown West over Sevier County\nLast Week: 29-7 (80.1 percent); Overall: 232-77 (75.1)", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=z5zYVwtTUCrs.kENf5e9O2Y3I&z=16"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:25:24.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
