(AP) — A Cranston man who weighs nearly 800 pounds has been kicked out of a hospital for ordering pizza.\nWLNE-TV reports 33-year-old Steven Assanti says he is addicted to food and has been enrolled in a weight loss program at Rhode Island Hospital for the past 80 days. He says he’s lost more than 20 pounds.\n WJAR-TV reported Tuesday that Assanti ordered a pizza as a reward for his progress but violated the rules of the plan in doing so. He was asked to leave Tuesday.\nHis father now says social workers are trying to arrange for Assanti to stay at Kent County Hospital through the weekend. He says he cannot afford to put Assanti in a hotel and that they’re considering an apartment complex in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:12:19.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
