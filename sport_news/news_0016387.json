(AP) - Democratic New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan's career in public service began as a fight to ensure her son Ben, who has cerebral palsy, could participate fully in society.\nIt led to runs for state Senate and governor, and now for U.S. Senate against Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte.\nIn the journey from parent advocate to Senate candidate, Hassan's home life has shaped her political philosophy. Her colleagues see that philosophy come through in policies she pursues, from supporting same-sex marriage to fighting for Medicaid expansion.\nRepublicans criticize Hassan for taking credit they don't believe she deserves on the state budget and say she's in lock step with her party. But in Hassan, Democrats see a fighter prepared to take on what will be one of the country's most closely watched Senate contests.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
