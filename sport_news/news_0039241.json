Theo Foster also scored a short rushing touchdown and gained 103 yards on 13 carries to give the Jaguars another offensive spark. \nCentral built a 22-0 lead before Ozen scored on its final possession of the first half and its opening possession of the second to trim the margin to 22-14. Foster's touchdown countered Ozen's early second half touchdown, and a later Panthers touchdown that pulled them back to within eight points was immediately answered by Whaley's fourth touchdown. \n\"(Playing Ozen) is a lot of motivation,\" Whaley said. \"We had a great week of practice to get ready. We worked hard all week and came in pretty confident.\" \nTURNING POINT \nCalvin Tyler, Jr. hauled in a 37–yard scoring strike from Josh Boyd to pull Ozen within 29-21 on the first play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, but in Central's next series, Whaley and Foster ripped off their longest runs of the game on successive plays to propel Central into the red zone. \nWhaley's 3-yard touchdown run one play after Foster's run essentially gave Central control of the game. \nMOST SPECTACULAR PLAY \nCentral kept focusing its offense around straight forward handoffs to Whaley and Foster that sent them into the heart of their offensive line. \nThe results weren't dramatic, with Whaley's 37 yard run in the fourth quarter the only Jaguars rush of more than 20 yards, but yardage gained after contact by Whaley and Foster consistently kept Central's drives alive. \n\"If you have a good week of practice, it's real easy to execute,\" Whaley said. \"I've got to give it all up to my offensive line for creating holes.\" \nBY THE NUMBERS \nTyler has been explosive all season, so his 84 yards and one rushing touchdown on 24 carries was well below average for him. \nBoyd threw for 266 yards and two touchdowns, but most of that was when Ozen was in desperate comeback mode. \nThe numbers that stood out most, however, were four Panther turnovers compared to zero by the Jags. Ozen's only two punt attempts were both blocked by Central. \n\"We didn't turn the ball over for the first time this year and that's big,\" Central coach Toby Foreman said. \"I think the difference in the game, though, was special teams.\" \nRECORDS \nCentral 3-4, 3-1. Ozen 3-4, 1-3. \nHE SAID IT \n\"(Friday night) was one mistake after one mistake after another mistake after a mistake,\" Ozen coach David Suggs said. \"Those are the things we did and we've got to take responsibility for them.\" \nNEXT UP \nCentral plays at Vidor at 7 p.m., Friday. Ozen plays host to Port Neches–Groves at 7 p.m. Friday.
