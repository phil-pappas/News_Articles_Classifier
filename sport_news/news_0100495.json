(AP) - A brawl that cleared the East Mississippi Community College bench when it was ahead 48-0 has also barred the school from this year's playoffs for community and junior colleges.\nThe Commercial Dispatch ( http://bit.ly/1Nuplu7 ) reports that Jim Southward, commissioner of the Mississippi Association of Community and Junior Colleges, confirmed the postseason ban Friday.\nHe says each player who left the bench area was suspended for two games - and so many players left East Mississippi's bench that it cannot field a playoff team.\nItawamba replaced East Mississippi in the playoffs.\nAn East Mississippi news release says it's considering an appeal.\nSince the game was the season's last for Delta, returning players will sit out next year's first two games, with returning East Mississippi players out of the season opener.\nInformation from: The Commercial Dispatch, http://www.cdispatch.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
