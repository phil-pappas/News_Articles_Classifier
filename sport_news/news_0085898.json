Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: What's happened to Ricky Seals Jones, seems to hardly get any passes thrown his way. I know Kirk and Reynolds have been the top two wideouts, but it seems like the offense would benefit by spreading the wealth a little more\nHairopoulos : Agree. He's got 10 catches for 94 yards and no touchdowns. Had 1 catch last week. Seems like Texas A&M has been using him more in the blocking schemes than anything. I know Kevin Sumlin wants to get the other receivers involved more, as they'll need to as defenses key on Kirk and Reynolds. The TD pass in overtime was originally designed to go to Seals-Jones over the middle, but Kyle Allen went with Kirk, who was in man coverage.\nQuestion: Using your best guesstimate, when do you think the Ags will take on tu again?\nHairopoulos : Lordy. I don't know. Not for a long time. It will happen, but it will take a meeting in a big bowl game or the right situation with the right TV money and an immense thawing to return as a scheduled nonconference meeting.\nQuestion: Dave South butchered the potential game-winning field goal call. Any idea if he gets replaced or if we just have him forever?\nHairopoulos : I was listening to the ESPN announcers, so not sure what happened. I can ask around. Aren't Dave and Dave an A&M tradition?:)\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/chats/2015/09/23/kate-hairopoulos-answers-texas-amsec-questions-3-pm-wednesday-sept-30-ask-now?hootPostID=6a3da5c44a6a9fe3981fd7def88d217c"], "published": "2015-10-01T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:48:47.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
