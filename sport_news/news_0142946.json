Unlike Ray Rice, though, he isn't apologizing for his acts of domestic violence. No, he's telling jokes that he thinks are funny. He's talking about Tom Brady's wife. And other wives. And he's calling his time away from the game \"the most awesome period of my life, man. I'm a Dallas Cowboy. Dream come true.\" If there's one man in professional sports who should be contrite, it's Hardy. Clearly, he doesn't have it in him. ... Hardy, 27, had not spoken publicly about this, or anything else, since signing with the Cowboys in March. So when reporters showed up at his locker Tuesday, every word was a revelation. ... I'd like to close by giving Hardy an example of what an apology actually looks and sounds like. \"Domestic violence is real,\" Rice told ESPN's Jemele Hill in an interview over the summer. \"It happens every 12 seconds as we speak. I made a life-long commitment to my wife and to my daughter, to the survivors of domestic violence, to go out there and not only help but share my story so that men can make better decisions. That was the worst decision I've ever made in my life. To the survivors of domestic violence, I understand how real it is, and I don't want to ever take that for granted because this is a real issue in our society. My video put the light out there. If you have never seen what domestic violence looks like and you look at my video, I could understand why some people would never forgive me.\" Remind me again why Rice is considered persona non grata in the NFL, while Hardy will be welcomed back with open arms on Sunday. \nKevin Manahan may be reached at kmanahan@njadvancemedia.com .
