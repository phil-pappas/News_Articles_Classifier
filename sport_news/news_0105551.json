She trailed 5-3 in the final set but took the last four games to close out the win. \nFriedsam was ranked a career-high 73rd in July when she sprained her ankle and was out for six weeks. She failed to win another match until reaching the quarterfinals in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, two weeks ago. \nThe 59th-ranked Larsson won her maiden WTA title in Bastad, Sweden, in July.
