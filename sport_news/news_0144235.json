He further stated, “Carbon Sports’ carbon fiber material has passed 1,000,000 cycle tests, meaning that the AirBlade will never lose its ‘pop’ like other composite sticks on the market today.”\nWhen it comes to puck feel, users describe the AirBlade as “an extension of your hands.” The solid carbon fiber blade and patented micro-grip technology provide a large sweet spot and better connect a player’s hands to the puck, providing incredible puck feel and increased shot accuracy. Due to the AirBlade’s perforated construction, air flows freely through the blade, reducing drag, increasing swing speed, and maximizing shot power.\n“If you’re looking for the best hockey stick for the money, the AirBlade is the ideal choice,” stated Mr. Fucillo.\nThe AirBlade can be tailored to player specifications by choosing curve, flex, grip and orientation. All sticks come with an industry-leading 30-day money-back guarantee and a 60-day general warranty.
