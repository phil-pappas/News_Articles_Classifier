Estrada pitched one-hit ball into the eighth inning, giving Toronto's tattered bullpen a rest, and the Blue Jays beat the Royals 7-1 Wednesday to close to 3-2 in the best-of-seven series. Troy Tulowitzki broke open the game with a three-run double off Kelvin Herrera in the sixth, giving him seven RBIs in the series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:33:29.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
