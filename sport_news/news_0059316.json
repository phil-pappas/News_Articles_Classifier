Combining award-winning waterproof protection with the digitally enhanced, life-sized natural elements of Break-Up Country brings a truly unique product to whitetail hunters at the Midwest’s largest retail sporting goods chain. \nSince RIVERS WEST introduced their proprietary waterproof fleece to the outdoor industry 15 years ago, their products have adorned the backs of mountain guides, law enforcement, hard-core hunters, and offshore fishermen and camera crews on the deadly Bering Sea. As strong as the brand has been in the harsh conditions of the West, the brand has only seen moderate success in the Midwest and Eastern U.S. \nAccording to RIVERS WEST Executive Vice President, Matthew Ryan: \n“Just because the terrain, weather patterns, and hunting style is different in the western U.S. doesn’t mean Midwestern and Eastern hunters should be deprived of the absolute protection and virtual silence our products provide. In the West, staying warm, dry, and silent is a necessity as you stalk miles of wilderness chasing herds of elk and mule deer. Using quality gear when you’re isolated in the back country literally becomes a safety issue. The farther east you hunt, this necessity becomes less of a life-threatening issue. While the weather is still harsh and unpredictable for those hunters, they are often nestled in a tree stand on a smaller parcel of land not too far from safety of their vehicle. Even still, staying warm, dry, quiet, and concealed is a standard every hunter needs to achieve to increase their odds.” \nIt is that concept which led RIVERS WEST to approach Dunham’s Sports and Mossy Oak to develop a waterproof and breathable system specifically designed for the Midwestern and Eastern whitetail hunter. \n“As the pioneer of waterproof fleece, we thought we would ask the pioneer in true-to-life camouflage patterns if they would introduce their newest pattern on our virtually silent waterproof technology to Dunham’s Sports,” said Ryan. “Industry leaders collaborated to allow this exclusive product to be offered at an attractive price point that doesn’t require a trip to the bank.” \nAt a value price of $59.99, the Mackinaw Jacket and Pant are made from lightweight Advanced Waterproof Fleece with a comfort range of 38–58 degrees F. Not just lightweight and quiet, but they are extremely packable as well. The top and bottom conveniently pack into the jacket hood making them easy to store and exceptionally portable. The Mackinaw Jacket features a stow-away hood with built-in visor, which disperses rain away from your face and 3-way adjustability for maximum protection without sacrificing visibility. Neoprene Sling-Gripper shoulders provide hands-free convenience at angles up to 30 degrees while a double-storm placket and comfort cuffs help keep water from entering the jacket. With two cargo pockets and two handwarmer pockets, the Mackinaw Jacket has plenty of room for all the essentials. \nThe matching pant features six suspender buttons, a full zip fly, an elasticized back waist, and seven belt loops to provide a comfortable fit with several options to prevent any slippage. There are two rear snapped pockets, two handwarmer pockets, and a Taffeta lining which helps the pants easily slide over base layers without hiking them up your leg as you put them on. Both products are exclusively available in Break-Up Country and sold exclusively at Dunham’s Sports. \n“In all honesty, there isn’t a better waterproof hunting outfit on the market at this price,” said Ryan. “In my 15 years at RIVERS WEST, this is the best value we have ever delivered; and it wouldn’t have been possible without help from Mossy Oak and Dunham’s Sports.” \nVisit www.dunhamssports.com for coupon and to find a store near you. \nBased in the Seattle area, RIVERS WEST introduced its Original Waterproof Fleece TM to the US hunting market in 2001 to rave reviews. In 2013, the award-winning brand improved upon its lineup with Advanced Waterproof Fleece TM . To date, it is the only waterproof/breathable, fully seam-sealed genuine fleece product within the hunting market. Instead of using a brushed Tricot fabric which is commonly referred to as a ‘fleece-like’ substitute by several hunting brands, RIVERS WEST believes the soft hand, exceptional stretch, and virtual silence of genuine fleece is second to none. \nFounded in 1937 as Dunham’s Bait & Tackle, the Michigan-based corporation has grown to become the Midwest’s largest sporting goods chain. With over 200 locations in 19 states, Dunham’s Sports specializes traditional sporting goods, athletic equipment, and a wide variety of active and casual sports apparel and footwear.
