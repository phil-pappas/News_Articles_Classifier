I’m totally responsible for that.” \nIs Snyder really to blame for the Wildcats' collapse, or were there other mistakes made leading up to the fourth-and-1 play call? The Topeka Capital-Journal's Ken Corbitt, Kevin Haskin and Tim Bisel debate this on the latest edition of the KSU CatZone Podcast. Also discussed: whether injuries affected K-State's second-half strategy, the decision to abandon the running game in the second half, and the Wildcats' next game against reeling Oklahoma.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:14.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
