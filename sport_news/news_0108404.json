(Photo: MICHAEL ROLANDS/RECORD-HERALD) Buy Photo 16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMost playoff spots are secure, but there's a lot of work left to do in the final week of Iowa's high school football regular season. \nDistricts across the state in all six classes still have places up for grabs. The top four teams in each district advance to next Wednesday's first round, totaling 32 teams in each classification. First- and second-place teams have mostly separated themselves in district play and earned home-field advantage as a result. \nThat leaves Friday night's biggest games for teams on the fringe. \nDoes fourth place feel flimsy? Are you worried about the Iowa High School Athletic Association's 13-point tiebreaker? \nThe breakdown on your district's tight and exciting race is below. Teams in bold are playing for the positions listed. CLASS 4A \nSix out of eight districts have a team in sole possession of first place. Ten teams enter Week 9 with one win or less. That means the middle class in the state's largest classification has mostly fallen into place. \nDistrict 1: Des Moines East (4-4, 1-3) has the head-to-head advantage over Council Bluffs Thomas Jefferson (1-7, 1-3) for fourth place. And the Scarlets will be favored in Week 9 against Sioux City North (1-7, 0-4), which has been outscored in district play by 123 points. \nDistrict 3: Des Moines Hoover (5-3, 2-2) holds the key. Currently sitting third, the Huskies play at fifth-place Sioux City West (2-6, 1-3) on Thursday. Des Moines Lincoln (4-4, 2-2) has to sit idly by until Friday, hoping Hoover wins or needing a victory over No. 4 Valley. Two of those three teams will earn first-round road games. \nDistrict 4: The simplest solution for fourth-place is head-to-head. The winner of Indianola (4-4, 1-3) at Marshalltown (3-5, 1-3) moves on to the postseason. Both teams picked up their lone district wins over Mason City. Prep football: Hoover, Lincoln linked in dual playoff push CLASS 3A \nIt's looking convoluted in the class that has played the closest playoff games over the last three seasons. A couple districts — one in north-central Iowa and the other south-central — still have to figure out their third and fourth spots. \nDistrict 2: Four teams have three district losses, and only two can get into the playoffs. To make it even tougher, none of them play each other in Week 9. Greene County (4-4, 2-3) holds the slightest edge in the tiebreaker, but has to take on second-place Carroll. Boone (2-6, 2-3) has an even taller task at unbeaten and third-ranked Webster City. More likely to sneak in is Humboldt (3-5, 2-3), playing at winless Perry, or Algona (5-3, 3-3), which has already completed its district slate. All are separated by less than 2.3 tiebreaker points. \nDistrict 7: Carlisle (5-3, 3-2) is alone in third place. Unless the Wildcats are upset at Oskaloosa (2-6, 2-3) , fourth place will likely come down to the tiebreaker. Knoxville (5-3, 2-3) plays No. 6 Norwalk, while Chariton (5-3, 2-3) has to take on top-ranked and defending champion Pella. Toppling a ranked rival is a sound strategy to get in, but otherwise Chariton (-0.4), Knoxville (-3.2) and Oskaloosa (-5.8) have to worry about those point-differential margins. High School Pick 'Em: Predict the winners of this week's big games CLASS 2A \nFond of three-way ties? Look no further. The tangle of teams should be separated after Friday night's finals, but plenty of spots are still up-for-grabs in 2A. \nDistrict 1: Three teams with identical records are vying for one spot. Sioux Center (4-4, 2-3) versus Okoboji (4-4, 2-3) should decide fourth place in the northwest, because MOC-Floyd Valley (4-4, 2-3) has to host unbeaten No. 3 Spirit Lake. And the Dutchmen lost to both squads head-to-head. \nDistrict 3: It's a knot at the top. Defending champion North Fayette Valley (6-2, 4-1) beat Waukon (7-1, 4-1) by 40 points in Week 5, but lost to Dyersville Beckman (5-3, 4-1) in Week 6. So, of course, Waukon already sealed the three-way tie by beating Beckman in Week 4. NFV holds the first-place tiebreaker, but also has the toughest challenge this week at fourth-place New Hampton (4-4, 3-2). Any win or loss from those teams would shuffle the order, with Center Point-Urbana (4-4, 2-3) attempting to sneak up on Beckman. \nDistrict 6: Eyes will be on the district title game between No. 2 South Tama and No. 4 Aplington-Parkersburg, and rightfully so. But a showdown should decide fourth place as well: Roland-Story (3-4, 2-3) at Iowa Falls-Alden (3-5, 2-3). One fewer non-district game — the result of a Week 1 rainout — won't affect the Norsemen's resume. It all comes down to one win. \nDistrict 8: Placements would fit fine if the season ended last week. Carroll Kuemper (3-5, 3-2) and Shenandoah (6-2, 3-2) sit third and fourth, but have to play each other. The loser will have three losses, prime to be picked off by Red Oak (4-4, 2-3) or Clarinda (3-5, 2-3), two teams searching for mild upsets over East Sac (4-4, 4-1) and Southeast Valley (6-2, 4-1), respectively. Every spot is open. Super 10 rankings: Nine new spots after wild Week 8 CLASS 1A \nEveryone is chasing five-time defending champion Iowa City Regina — the first two were in 2A — and the field of contenders is almost full. A few familiar squads are still slugging it out to join in before it's too late. \nDistrict 2: A three-way tie for first will be split after Friday night. Ridge View (7-1, 4-1) plays at No. 9 Western Christian (6-2, 4-1) and the winner will have a head-to-head tiebreaker with No. 10 Hinton (7-1, 4-1). Western beat the Blackhawks two weeks ago; Ridge View fell to them way back in Week 3. Last year's runner-up, West Lyon, is back in fourth. \nDistrict 6: Fourth is all that's available in Iowa City Regina's district, and four teams are fighting for it. Highland (4-4, 2-4) has the edge, having finished its district schedule. The winner of Columbus Junction (2-6, 1-4) vs. Eddyville-Blakesburg-Fremont (1-7, 1-4) would like to have a say — Highland lost to the former but beat the latter — but West Marshall (2-6, 1-4) could get involved, too, with an upset of third-place Sigourney-Keota. \nDistrict 7: Fort Dodge St. Edmond (4-4, 2-3) has made back-to-back trips to the UNI-Dome, but it needs help to even have a shot of making it three straight. Madrid (6-2, 3-2) and Manson-Northwest Webster (3-5, 3-2) are currently third and fourth and play against each other on Friday night. So, the Gaels need to win and have Madrid lose to win the head-to-head tiebreaker of 3-3 teams. The Cougars beat St. Edmond in Week 3 and would hold the unlikely edge. \nDistrict 8: A top-heavy district has left four teams playing for two spots at 2-3. A winner is guaranteed from Woodward-Granger (4-4, 2-3) at Des Moines Christian (3-5, 2-3). That means either Interstate 35 (4-4, 2-3) needs to snap a three-game district skid at Southwest Valley or Central Decatur (3-5, 2-3) has to upset No. 6 Van Meter to join in. Two of the four need to win, or the tiebreaker could get crazy; they're all separated by 1.4 points in the differential average. CLASS A \nThe class with the most teams and most district games has, fittingly, the most straight-up matchups for playoff berths on Friday. All eight districts currently have or will have one outright leader. \nDistrict 1: It's a fourth-place tie for now. Maple Valley-Anthon-Oto (4-4, 3-3) is right at .500 with Westwood (4-4, 3-3) entering Week 9, but not all district finales were created equal. MVAO will try and win a playoff spot against winless Riverside, while Westwood is stuck with defending champion Logan-Magnolia. There's only space for one. \nDistrict 2: It's one game for the final spot with Sioux Central (4-4, 3-3) playing at Woodbury Central (4-4, 3-3). The clubs are currently tied for fourth and have lost two of their last three, but all that matters: win and you're in. \nDistrict 6: Pekin and Winfield-Mount Unionhave clinched playoff spots at 6-0 and faceoff Friday to decide first-place. Lone Tree (5-3, 4-2) is in too, but it has to join the fray and fight for third or fourth, traveling to New London (4-4, 3-3) while WACO (3-5, 3-3) hosts Danville (2-6, 2-4). WACO holds a 1.1-point lead on New London in the tiebreaker. \nDistrict 8: Mount Ayr and Pleasantville have blown out everyone, but Bedford (5-3, 3-3) and Nodaway Valley (4-4, 3-3) have hung in and now have a chance to qualify with a win. The two squads will meet in Greenfield with the fourth and final playoff spot on the line. EIGHT-PLAYER \nFor all the excitement and scoring of eight-player football, parity isn't usually part of the equation. Every first-place team is undefeated and owns a double-digit tiebreaker differential. \nDistrict 3: Riceville (5-4, 2-4) has a Week 9 bye and will sit and watch the race for fourth-place unfold. Tripoli (4-4, 2-3) can secure a spot with a win at Clarksville, which has lost all five of its district games by a combined 275 points. \nDistrict 6: Another one-sided tie for fourth-place gives Twin Cedars (4-4, 3-3) a regular season finale at winless Harmony, while Lamoni (3-5, 3-3) has to play at dominant and second-place Wayne. The two challengers are separated by a mere 0.5 tiebreaker points, but the margin likely won't matter after Friday. \nDistrict 8: It's up to Nishnabotna (3-5, 2-4) to make this race messy. The Blue Devils need a win to force a fourth-place tie with Week 9 opponent Stanton (5-3, 3-3). That could involve CAM (4-4, 3-3) too, which wraps up its regular season at No. 5 Lenox. <a href=\"//8115148.polldaddy.com/s/high-school-insider-pick-em-week-9\">View Survey</a> 16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1LJ8iVP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:27:57.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
