The West Indies players, who were to play a T20 International and three Tests, decided to return home after the fourth ODI in Dharamsala due to failure of talks between West Indies Players Association and WICB.\n\"WICB president Dave Cameroon met BCCI president Shashank Manohar a few days ago and stressed that the WICB was not in a position to pay the amount BCCI filed in the legal suit. To compensate the loss incurred by the\nBCCI, they (WICB) are willing to send their top team to India,\" a source told mid-day yesterday.\nWith the conflict of issue being strongly dealt with, the BCCI will take a call on whether to continue with the Cricket Advisory Committee, which consists of legendary Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, in the November 9 Annual General Meeting in Mumbai. While Ganguly is president of Cricket Association of Bengal, Tendulkar and Laxman are part of IPL teams.\nIt is learnt that Manohar and BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur stressed on the need to take good care of sponsors and provide the best seats to them in the stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:49:23.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
