Ervin finished with 147 yards from scrimmage, 74 through the air and 73 on the ground.\nUNLV (2-4, 1-1) had the first overtime turn and settled for a 43-yard field goal attempt after going nowhere on three plays. But the Spartans' Isaiah Irving blocked Nicolai Bornand's kick.\nBornand's 49-yarder with 11 seconds left in regulation forced overtime when it glanced off the right post and through.\nThe Rebels erased a 20-10 deficit in the fourth quarter as Kurt Palandech threw TD passes to Andrew Price and Devonte Boyd for a 24-20 lead with 3:49 remaining.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
