Line of demarcation The Seattle offensive line has been a topic of conversation since the offseason, and its performance through four games has done nothing to alleviate concerns that the unit might be the team's Achilles heel. The group -- consisting of Russell Okung, Justin Britt, Drew Nowak, J.R. Sweezy and Garry Gilliam -- has allowed Russell Wilson to be sacked 18 times, which ties for a league high with Kansas City. That puts the Hawks on pace to challenge the single-season record of 76, set by David Carr and the Houston Texans in 2002. Things won't get easier against a Bengals front that features standouts Geno Atkins (second among defensive tackles with 3.0 sacks) and defensive end Carlos Dunlap (3.5 sacks).
