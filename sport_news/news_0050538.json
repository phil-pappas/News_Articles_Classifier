Park skipped her title defense at Miramar to play in a Korea LPGA event, where she tied for second Sunday. \nKo took the top spot from Park with a second-place tie in January in the season-opening event in Florida, and Park moved back in front with her major victory in the Women's PGA Championship in June in New York. \nAt 18 years, 6 months, 1 day, Ko is the youngest player to win 10 events on any major tour. Horton Smith set the PGA Tour mark of 21 years, 7 months in 1929, and Nancy Lopez set the previous LPGA Tour record in 1979 at 22 years, 2 months, 5 days. Ko won her first LPGA Tour title as an amateur in the 2012 Canadian Women's Open at a record 15 years, 4 months, 2 days. \nKo broke ties with Park for the tour victory lead and the No. 1 spot in the player of the year points race, and earned $300,000 to increase her tour-leading total to $2,716,753. \nKo finished at 20-under 268 after opening with rounds of 69, 67 and 67 to take a four-stroke lead into the final day. South Koreans So Yeon Ryu and Eun-Hee Ji tied for second. \nKo birdied four of the six holes, bogeyed the par-3 seventh, and opened a seven-shot lead with the eagle on 12. She added birdies on the par-3 14th and par-5 18th, chipping to a foot on the last. \nThe South Korean-born teen has three victories in her last five starts. She won in Canada and France — where she became the youngest major champion — in consecutive starts, tied for second two weeks ago in Malaysia and tied for fourth last week in South Korea. \nIn addition to her 10 LPGA Tour titles, Ko has four other worldwide victories, including a 2013 KLPGA tournament at Miramar and a Ladies European Tour event this year in New Zealand. \nRyu shot a 68, and Ji had a 70. England's Charley Hull was fourth at 10 under after a 70. \nThe tournament was the third in the five-event Asian Swing. The Blue Bay LPGA is next week in China, followed by the Japan Classic. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:17:46.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
