The defense forced a three-and-out and the offense went 72 yards in five plays, capped by wide receiver Shane Williams-Rhodes 53-yard TD pass to fellow wide receiver Thomas Sperbeck on the double pass. It was a new twist on a Boise State favorite because Sperbeck usually is the thrower on that play. Safety Darian Thompson forced a fumble two plays later to set up a Tyler Rausa field goal for a 10-0 lead. After another three-and-out, tailback Jeremy McNichols broke a 56-yard touchdown run for a 17-0 lead. The Rams offense finally got untracked on the ensuing possession. They marched 75 yards in 16 plays, converting two fourth-and-1s along the way. On third-and-12 at the Boise State 13-yard line (actually the first play of the second quarter), wide receiver Joe Hansley broke free in the front of the end zone for an easy TD pass from backup QB Coleman Key. In-game analysis: This was one of those games that would test the Broncos focus more than their ability  and the hot start showed they were ready to play. Boise State scored on the opening drive for just the second time this year. Colorado State did take advantage of the one weakness in the defense, third-and-long, on the TD. \nSecond quarter: The Broncos answered the Rams touchdown in one play  a perfect throw by Rypien to Sperbeck on a deep crossing route. Sperbeck ran away from the defense for an 85-yard TD. The Broncos missed chances to expand their 24-7 lead when Rausa missed a 55-yard field-goal attempt and McNichols was stuffed on fourth-and-1. Colorado State made it 24-10 on a 62-yard drive that ended with a field goal. The Broncos pulled ahead 27-10 on a field goal on the final play of the half. In-game analysis: The Broncos probably should have scored more than 27 points in the first half but too much pass rush on Rypien and the fourth-down failure  short-yardage offense has been a problem all season  got in the way. Colorado State was able to drive the ball in the quarter but the Broncos were tough around the red zone. Cornerback Jonathan Moxey made an acrobatic interception. Halftime stats: Boise State outgained Colorado State 383-177. Rypien was 16-for-24 for 245 yards and a TD with one sack and no turnovers. Sperbeck made five catches for 178 yards and two touchdowns. McNichols had nine carries for 65 yards and a TD. The Broncos threw for 298 yards. Colorado State backup QB Coleman Key was 4-for-14 for 46 yards and a TD with an interception. Starter Nick Stevens was pulled after going for 0-for-1. Star wide receiver Rashard Higgins had two catches for 32 yards. The Rams rushed for 96 yards against the Broncos second-ranked rush defense. \nThird quarter: Rypien threw his first college interception on the opening drive of the second half. The defense held when Thompson grabbed an interception of his own with Colorado State in scoring position. The Broncos put together their best sustained drive of the night later in the quarter for a 34-10 lead. The 10-play, 82-yard march was keyed by McNichols 40-yard catch on third-and-5. Rypien had a long time to throw and spotted McNichols running down the sideline. McNichols finished the drive with a 1-yard TD run but took a hit to the head at the goal line that kept him on the field for a minute or two. In-game analysis: The Broncos offense struggled all night to sustain drives, relying on the big plays, until the third-quarter TD drive. The defense continued to come up big when needed. \nFourth quarter: Rypien scored his first college touchdown on a 4-yard run with 12:18 left in the game. Then the Broncos emptied the bench. \n• • • \nNOTEBOOK \nUnforgettable week for Thompson \nBoise State senior safety Darian Thompson welcomed his daughter into the world Wednesday in Boise and tied a Mountain West record with his 18th career interception Saturday at Colorado State. \nThompson missed practice Wednesday so he could be with his girlfriend, Chelsey, as Novah Rosemarie was born. \nPretty cool week, Thompson said. ... (The birth) was absolutely nuts. I cant even really explain it. Its something Ill never forget. Im truly blessed for the family I have. \nThompson also forced a fumble and finished with five tackles against the Rams. \nJust an uncommon person, coach Bryan Harsin said. Theres a reason hes a captain, theres a reason hes on the side of our stadium. Hes just a guy whos got a maturity about him at practice, even on the sideline during games, whether were up or not. Its not about motivating him; its just about whats next. \nThompsons interception in the third quarter tied former Utah defensive back Eric Weddle, who is a longtime member of the San Diego Chargers. Thompson, who is one ahead of teammate Donte Deayon, also tied the Boise State FBS-era school record of 18 set by cornerback Gabe Franklin (2001-04). \nThompsons continued playmaking is bolstering his resume for the NFL Draft. He is one of the nations top safety prospects. \nDefinitely there was a different feeling, he said of Saturdays game. Im a father now and thats something I keep in the back of my mind. I have to go out here and try to provide for my family. \nA new spin on an old trick \nBoise State used its double pass  a lateral to a wide receiver with a second throw to follow  in a new way Saturday night. \nSenior wide receiver Shane Williams-Rhodes threw the first pass of his career in the first quarter. His target: junior wide receiver Thomas Sperbeck, who usually is the passer on the Broncos trick plays. \nThe defense was so fooled that Sperbeck was wide open. The play resulted in a 53-yard touchdown.

His average per catch: 27 yards. \nRausa tries another long one \nBoise State junior kicker Tyler Rausa missed a 55-yard field-goal attempt wide left in the second quarter. He also has missed from 54 yards this season. \nHes 11-for-11 on his other attempts with a long of 51. He hit from 27 and 35 yards in the first half against Colorado State. \nQB change for Colorado State \nAfter two drives without a first down to start the game, Colorado State switched to freshman quarterback Coleman Key. Key played the rest of the first half. \nStarter Nick Stevens was 0-for-1 before he was removed. Key finished 5-for-19 for 56 yards and a TD with two interceptions. He also rushed for 25 yards and proved elusive as a scrambler. \nStevens came back late in the game and was 8-for-10 for 60 yards overall. \nQuick hits \nThe Broncos wore blue pants, white jerseys and blue helmets. ... The single-game captains were linebacker Ben Weaver and tight end Holden Huff. ... Nickel Chanceller James carried the Hammer. ... Boise State won the coin toss and deferred. ... It was 84 degrees at kickoff. ... Deayon returned a punt 67 yards in the first quarter. The play was completely wiped out by a holding call on defensive end Jabril Frazier. ... Attendance: 26,117. ... Boise State had a shutout streak of 108 minutes, 13 seconds before Colorado State scored in the second quarter. ...
