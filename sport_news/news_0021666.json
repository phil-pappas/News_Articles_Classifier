The Mets’ fans would turn on him. His peers in the baseball fraternity would regard him with disdain.\nWhen he and Boras even brought up the possibly in September, Mets fans became unglued, and he was torched by the tabloids. He was called everything from a hypocrite to a traitor, with columnists demanding the Mets trade him during the winter.\n“I’ll be the last person to ever bring that one up again,’’ Harvey said. “I think everybody kind of had enough talk and discussion about that whole ordeal.’’\nReally, it’s nobody’s fault what has happened.\nThe plan all along, talked about last November, and agreed to in spring training by Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, Harvey and agent Scott Boras, was that Harvey would have a 185-inning limit.\nNo one envisioned what would happen next.\nUSA TODAY\nThe Walkoff Podcast: Previewing the NLCS between the Cubs, Mets\nThe Mets got good, the Washington Nationals turned bad, and before anyone knew it, Mets won the NL East, reaching the postseason for the first time since 2006.\nSo they put those original plans were put in the shredder, and the revised version was to have Harvey pitch one game in the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Harvey was good enough to beat the Dodgers 13-7, and three nights later, the Mets won Game 5, too, eliminating the Dodgers.\nNow, with 194 1/3 innings under his belt, the Mets are calling upon him again. This time, for Game 1. And, if needed, again for Game 5.\nAnd if the Mets knock off the Cubs in the NLCS, guess who’ll be asked to make at least two more starts in the World Series?\nThat just so happens to be Harvey, who would be the first known pitcher in baseball history to not having thrown a pitch in a single season after undergoing “Tommy John’’ surgery, to eclipsing 200 innings.\nAnd you wonder why he’s taken an insurance policy out on his arm, knowing that if something dramatically goes wrong, and he suffers a career-ending injury, he at least will have a few bucks in the bank account.\nThe Mets, of course, could stop him themselves, just like the Washington Nationals did three years ago with ace Stephen Strasburg, who was coming off Tommy John surgery. The Nats’ front office shut down Strasburg, who was 15-6 with a 3.16 ERA, after 160 innings in September.\nA month later, they were whisked out of the playoffs in the first round by the St. Louis Cardinals.\nNo one blamed Strasburg, because the Nationals didn’t give Strasburg a choice.\nThis decision, the Mets say, solely, belongs to Harvey.\nFOR THE WIN\nHow they're built: The construction and contributions of the MLB's four LCS teams\nSo what’s he going to say, no?\nHe’s left with no choice, and the Mets know it.\n“There was a little tumult along the way, and I think he's learned a lot from the experience,’’ Mets GM Sandy Alderson said, “and he's probably a much better pitcher and person as a result.\n“I can understand a certain reservation on his part as he got closer to what some people felt was a large number, and he got through that, and I think he has confidence now in his physical capacity, which is important for his mental approach.\n“So I think he's come through it really well, and I'm very proud of what he's been able to accomplish this season.’’\nThen again, that’s what Alderson, and every Mets fan wants to hear, right?\n“Physically, I think he’s fine,’’ Collins said, “and I think right now, mentally, he’s fine.’’\nTranslation: You go until you drop.\nIf Harvey can help the Mets win a World Series championship now, perhaps exposing himself to greater risk, that flag won’t be flying any less proud from Citi Field, and those rings won’t lose any luster.\nMaybe, the Strasburg situation is the worst thing that could have happened to Harvey.\nThe Nats believed they were at the infancy of a dynasty when they shut down Strasburg.\nUSA TODAY\nNL Championship Series capsule: Cubs vs. Mets\nYet, while Strasburg’s elbow has remained healthy, the Nats have yet to win a playoff series. They’ve been baseball’s biggest underachievers the last three years. And a year from now, they may not have Strasburg either. He’ll be eligible for free agency.\nThe Mets see this. They’re supposed to have a great future themselves with their quartet of young pitchers with Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Steven Matz, Zack Wheeler, and of, course, Harvey.\nYet, this game can be cruel.\nThe future guarantees nothing.\nThe Oakland A’s were a powerhouse in the late ‘80s, too, and were supposed to be a dynasty, and the only World Series they won was in 1989. The Atlanta Braves went to the postseason 14 consecutive years, and came away with just one title.\nMaybe there’s an urgency to win right now.\n“I wouldn't describe it as urgency,’’ Alderson said, “but this goes back to before the trade deadline. You recognize you're in a position to do something. You try to do your best to take advantage of it.\n“I mean, we understand that dynasties don't develop that often. You know, we like how we're set up for the future, but there's no guarantee going forward.’’\nIf the Mets were solely, worried about their future, Harvey wouldn’t be pitching now.\nIf they were guaranteed of future success, Syndergaard wouldn’t have warmed up three times in the bullpen Thursday, throwing more than 100 pitches, and pitched in relief for the first time in his career.\nIf they were promised tomorrow, closer Jeurys Familia wouldn’t be summoned for his first six-out save.\nThe Mets are going for the jugular.\nThey’ll worry about the future, along with Harvey’s inning and pitch limits, next spring.\nThey’ve got more important things to worry about.\nThey’ve got a World Series to win.\nIt may be Harvey’s future, but this is the Mets’ present.\nGALLERY: New York's potent young arms\nNew York's four postseason starters have an average age of 25. In the division series, they combined for 42 strikeouts. And don't forget about the Mets' electric closer.
