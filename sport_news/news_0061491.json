The former New Orleans mayor is serving a 10 year prison sentence for taking bribes from contractors seeking city work.\nHis appeal claims the judge gave the jury incorrect instructions which may have led to a different outcome.\nIn February of 2014, a jury found Nagin guilty on 20 of 21 counts of bribery, fraud and money laundering.\nProsecutors say contractors gave Nagin things like lavish vacation trips for he and his family, and in return those contractors were given multi-million dollar city contracts.\nProsecutors also say Nagin used his leverage to try and drum up business for his son's granite counter-top company.\nNagin's former technology chief and deputy mayor was also sentenced to two and a half years in prison for his role in the scheme.\nNagin has been serving his ten year sentence in a minimum security facility in Texas about three hours from his family's home.\n\"The way they do things, they break you down. You're nobody in jail. You are definitely a number. You get a menial job to do it 's not in any way an easy thing to do. You're not behind in a cage 24 hours a day, but in a camp, so you can walk around like on an army base. But its still jail, don't make any mistake about it. It is a difficult time,\" said FOX 8 legal analyst Joe Raspanti.\nOral arguments begin later this morning.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
