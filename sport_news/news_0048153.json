Marchand is out indefinitely. Julien also announced that defenseman Matt Irwin, the former San Jose Shark who signed a one-year, one-way contract worth $800,000 as a free agent, had been placed on waivers. Marchand, a four-time 20-goal scorer who led the B’s last year with 24, was hurt with about five minutes left in Saturday’s third period in a collision with Montreal’s Dale Weise. “We’re going about it through the (NHL’s concussion) protocol,’’ Julien said. “We have no timetable for him.’’ With Marchand unavailable, the Bruins moved linemate Loui Eriksson from right wing to left wing in Sunday’s practice, and pushed Brett Connolly up from the third line to skate at right wing with Eriksson and center Patrice Bergeron. Chris Kelly moved up from the fourth line to the third line, joining Ryan Spooner (center) and Jimmy Hayes, who moved from left to right wing. Irwin, 27, struggled in both of Boston’s losses, logging a minus-3 in a 6-2 loss to the Jets on Opening Night, and a minus-2 against the Canadiens. He had a different partner each game. Irwin’s absence left the Bruins with seven defensemen at Sunday’s practice, including captain Zdeno Chara, who hasn’t played yet because of an upper body injury. Chara, hurt in a Sept. 24 preseason game, has practiced since last Tuesday, and got a little extra work in on Sunday with Irwin gone. Julien wouldn’t definitely say if Chara will make his 2015-16 debut in Monday’s matinee against defending Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay at TD Garden (1:05 p.m., NESN, WBZ-FM/98.5). “I would say questionable,’’ Julien said. “We haven’t made that decision yet; a decision will probably be made (Monday). It’s not pain, more than it’s risk (of re-injury).’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:04:05.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
