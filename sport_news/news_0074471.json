Penn got down 21-0 to them because of turnovers and they were able to chip away, but it wasn't enough. We have a chance to score some points. Will it be enough?\"\nLast year as a freshman, Edmonds, a Central Dauphin East product, had 1,838 yards (the fourth most in a Patriot League season) and scored 23 touchdowns (tied for second-best in league history). Included in that breakout season was a 197-yard effort against Lehigh.\nThis year, Edmonds has 1,046 yards rushing, an average of 6.7 yards per carry and 149.4 per game.\n\"The defense has to continue to do what it did in the second half of the Yale game and at Bucknell,\" Coen said. \"At Bucknell, we had a good pass rush the whole game and it was the most passionate I've seen our team play.\n\"We were really plugged in and excited to play. Even after we gave up a scoring drive on the first possession of the game, we came back and didn't really give up anything the rest of the way even when the offense made some mistakes.\"\nLehigh is ranked sixth out of the seven Patriot League team in defense, allowing 434.8 yards per game, including 190.7 on the ground.\nRobb said the defense is definitely improved from 2014, but isn't where it wants to be yet.\n\"We've still got a lot of work to do and we're still working hard on getting better every single time we step on the field,\" Robb said. \"We've made a lot of progress, even from two weeks ago. We're getting there.\"\nAnd, certainly Robb is right where he needs to be as a key cog in the defense from his outside linebacker spot. He has been moved around position-wise throughout his Lehigh career, but has found a home and is making the most of it with 34 tackles, the third most on the team. He had seven tackles, including a sack, at Bucknell.\n\"Noah was our defensive player of the week last week and he keeps playing really well,\" Coen said. \"We've found a good fit for him with the scheme we're in.\n\"We thought he would be a good inside linebacker for us, but he never gained the weight we thought he would, but he's in a good spot for us now. He has to do a lot of pass coverage for us and he's athletic enough to be able to do that, but he's also very physical. I'm happy for him after what he went through and I'm happy he's playing so well as a senior.\"\nRobb, listed at 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, will be happy if Lehigh can finish this season strong.\n\"It was one of the best decisions I've ever made to come here,\" Robb said of staying in the Lehigh Valley. \"I like being close to home but I only go home on the weekends to have my mom do my laundry. I've received a great education and couldn't ask for a better place to spend the best four years of my life. But I don't want to leave Lehigh without a [championship] ring.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:17:16.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
