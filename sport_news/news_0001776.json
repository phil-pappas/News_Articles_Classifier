And while Thailand remains a backpacker’s haven, with development has come an onslaught of hotels, meaning that outrageously luxurious lodgings are never too far away wherever you might be. 1. Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok The Thai capital of Bangkok teems with luxury hotels but the heart of its hospitality heritage lies in the Mandarin Oriental , which was awarded five stars by the Forbes Travel Guide for both hotel and spa earlier this year , a first for Thailand. And indeed, with such unrelenting dedication to excellence, but also to maintaining its unique buzzy ambience and cherishing its history, you would be hard-pushed finding a better place to stay in Bangkok.Celebrating 140 years next year, the landmark hotel was the kingdom’s first when it opened up to foreign trade. Still the top choice for royalty, politicians, and celebrities, the hotel has welcomed everyone from Ray Charles to Michael Jackson.Situated on the Chao Praya River, the River of the Kings, the Mandarin Oriental is slotted between two artfully crumbling Italian renaissance influenced buildings reminiscent of Bangkok’s trading past. In a city that has a rich heritage but where most of it has been replaced by glass-clad high-rises, Siam’s golden era hotel is one of the city’s last pockets of history, making it a Bangkok must – even if it’s just for afternoon tea at the atmospheric Author’s Lounge within the Heritage wing that still boasts the original white nineteenth-century hotel façade.Today, the hotel has two new wings that are just finished being renovated, and counts the French Ambassador as its neighbour. The landmark hotel lies in two parts. While the rooms and outdoor pool are on the city side of the river, the signature Thai restaurant and spa are on the opposite bank and can be reached within minutes via wooden boat.Many of the rooms have wonderful river view and to ensure you book one of the best, ask for room 704, a lavishly decorated yet very cosy corner room that affords a double view upriver without having to move from your bed. In terms of rooms though, guests are spoilt for choice with 393 rooms and 14 suites, the latter of which have all been individually decorated – for instance, stay in Thai silk magnate Jim Thompson ’s favourite suite, a cosy atmospheric and arty room with dazzling river views.The hotel comes with a leafy outdoor riverfront pool that runs into the all-day Riverside Terrace restaurant. While the hotel has a flurry of outlets to choose from including renowned Le Normandie French restaurant, in the evenings guests should start with a signature 1953 ‘Tahito’ at the atmospheric Bamboo Bar followed by contemporary Thai gourmet cuisine at restaurant Sala Rim Naam. Here, elaborately bejewelled and costumed Thai folk dancers put on an impressive show to accompany a set menu of seafood, fish and meat dishes washed down by some of Thailand’s best wine originating in Hua Hin’s Monsoon Valley. Another highlight not to miss is the spa for a traditional Thai massage where the therapist will pummel away even the fiercest jet lag in your own private Thai style villa.With its stellar service and facilities, along with its unrivalled soul, the Mandarin Oriental may have been built way back in 1876 but it has nothing to envy other hotels in the city. And for those who find it just too hard to leave, good news is on the horizon: the hotel will be inaugurating its private residences across the river in 2018. 2. The Peninsula, Bangkok The only hotel that could rival the historical Mandarin Oriental, The Peninsula is an urban oasis that offers an understated luxury experience preferring a subdued mix of modern Chinese and colonial Thai styles with discreet service.A hotel for business and pleasure, The Peninsula Hotel has everything you could imagine (even a rooftop helipad). Established in 1998, the riverside hotel stands on the Chao Praya River just across from the Mandarin Oriental, in the quieter, more residential Thon Buri area. The highlights here are many-fold. To start with, all of the high-rise building’s 370 rooms boast splendid river views hard to find elsewhere. I could have stayed curled up on the plush sofa of my suite watching the boats glide gracefully across the waters backed by the skyscraper-studded skyline. Ask for a corner room like room 1704, which appears to overhang the river and has triple river views from the living room and double views from the bedroom, giving the space an unexpected serene appeal.The second highlight is the beautiful Thiptara (meaning ‘heavenly river’), the hotel’s signature Thai restaurant is laid out along the riverfront, the breeze a welcome break from the sweaty city. The four restored antique teak salas (traditional Thai huts) brought from the ancient Thai capital of Ayutthaya, give the space an authentic historic feel. Headed by Koh Samui-born chef, the cheerful Chamnan Thepchana, the cuisine here is focused on home-cooked natural and healthy goodness and is among the best in the country; and with stellar service offered by Tuky and her team, Thiptara should be top of your Bangkok dining wish list.Start with the restaurant’s signature Thai cocktails served in a coconut shell, followed by a defilé of tender chicken satay, spicy green mango salad, parcels of shrimp wrapped in pandan leaf parcels, followed by spicy lemongrass and prawn Tom Yum Goong Mae Naam soup. Continue with the slow roasted duck in red Thai curry sauce and basil or the pandan chicken with sesame and sweet soya sauce with healthy brown rice – and even if you’re completely full at this stage, don’t miss the moorish banana fritters with homemade coconut ice cream and honey. A dining experience that unarguably comes close to otherworldly.Other highlights include the exotic three-tier pool that looks right out onto the river and Bangkok’s skyline; perfect for doing laps or for relaxing in one of the poolside salas. However, the ultimate highlight has to be the spa.The setting of the three-floor spa is magnificent. Massage suites are located at the end of a bridge jutting out across a small bucolic mangrove forest, transporting you far from the Bangkok frenzy to an elegant countryside sanctuary. Book the contemporary Thai colonial style Riverside suite, which has an oversized sunken bathtub for two, a private steam room and balcony looking out to the pool and the river beyond. Candle-lit, the spa is focused on aromatherapy, and smells wonderful. An all-round top-of-the-range experience, The Peninsula provides a much-needed pocket of refined serenity among the relentless Bangkok bustle. 3. Soneva Kiri, Koh Kut, Northeast Thailand Not many travel north-east, but it’s here that Thailand’s real soul hides. For a below-the-radar beach getaway, head to Koh Chang, an archipelago of 50 or so islands located a five-hour drive from Bangkok – or a quick hop on board an eight-seater plane if you’re staying at the meticulously designed Soneva Kiri on the island of Koh Kut (also spelled ‘Koh Kood’). To sum up, it’s quite simple: if I were giving the award for the Best Hotel in the World, the luxurious castaway chic 35-villa eco-conscious hotel would be a serious contender.Pioneering luxury eco entrepreneurs Sonu and Eva Shivdasani, also behind Soneva Fushi in the Maldives and formerly behind Six Senses hotels, opened this hideaway in 2009. However, unlike the Maldivian island resort, there is no risk of getting island fever here as Koh Kut brims with scenic beaches and waterfalls as well as local life, including the picturesque stilted fishing village of Ao Salat.Spread across several hectares of lushly forested grounds lined by a magnificent powder white sandy beach, the hotel boasts sumptuous all-timber tented villas of up to six bedrooms that come with private pools as well as your own Mr or Mrs Friday to attend to your every need. Behind the rustic luxury are all the creature comforts one could ask for including a surround sound system, Wi-Fi, and an electric buggy you can drive throughout your stay. For the best of all worlds, choose villa number 8, said to also be Sonu’s favourite. A spacious one-bedroom villa with a pool, cosy outdoor lounge area and outdoor bathroom, as well as private access to the ocean, it’s perfect for unwinding.In terms of facilities expect everything and more, like a candle-lit outdoor jungle lake cinema experience at nightfall complete with homemade popcorn, an entire room full of every type of chocolate you could imagine at main hotel hub The Living Room, a breakfast buffet big enough to feed a small country, and best of all, lunch up in a tree pod hoisted over the ocean waters with your waiter who brings your food via zip wire. And the food here never fails to impress. Gabriel Le Roux, a well-travelled wonderfully inspiring and passionate South African chef, oversees all seven dining outlets, including The View, where guests dine outside on a wooden deck overhanging the sea – get here in time for sunset. Try the delicate rice paper spring rolls, perfectly grilled calamari, melt-in-the-mouth sea bream and snapper caught that morning, which Gabriel buys from neighbouring fishing villages. Like in all outlets the food is fresh, usually organic, where the vegetables are often from the kitchen garden run by the very personable Khun Khem who is in charge of the hotel’s sustainability area ‘Eco Centro’. Impressive, the unit works to reinforce seven slow life concepts including rubbish and wastewater recycling.At Soneva Kiri, the level of service is impeccable where the staff goes beyond just providing good service – they actually takes initiative. Hard to rival in terms of location but also facilities, service and green values, as well as guest experience, Soneva Kiri is a real game-changer that has succeeded in redefining the luxury hotel concept, and that places the bar unpredictably high indeed. 4. Four Seasons, Chiang Mai The Four Seasons Chiang Mai is all about setting, which will have you glued to your camera the whole time. However, do resist the temptation and soak up the 20 acres of leafy tropical gardens and its tangle of streams, and the hotel's rice field and picturesque lake with roaming water buffalo backed by the mountains in the distance – a real gem that's set in the ancient Lanna kingdom, the land of a thousand rice fields. Situated in the Mae Rim valley, it is under an hour’s drive to Chiang Mai's busy city centre. And for something even more out of the way, try the Four Seasons’ tented luxury nature lodge northwards in the Golden Triangle area where Thailand meets Myanmar and Laos.Back to the Four Seasons Chiang Mai, opt for a comfortable and spacious private pool. Listen to the monkeys and birds going about their daily lives while sitting on your swing bed out on the terrace lined by water basins and stepping stones that lead to your infinity pool surrounded by jungle, a small stream and mini waterfall as the backdrop. For families or groups looking for a more private luxury experience, the hotel has lofty residence villas with up to four bedrooms, complete with a kitchen, butlers, wine cellar, pools and all decorated in the ancient Lanna kingdom style with intricate carvings and paintings punctuated by dashes of bright Thompson silk.In the evenings, the hotel restaurant offers high-end Thai food at signature restaurant Sala Mae Rim, including an upmarket take on the local Khao Soi noodle soup – an absolute feast. Alternatively opt for a Mediterranean style experience at Terraces, the romantic candle-lit Italian restaurant set on an open colonial style deck above the rice field and lake.The best way to start the day is with the breakfast buffet served on the Sala Mae Rim restaurant terrace while looking out to the views. For help or for any queries, look out for Mary from Chengdu who can usually be found here; she sets high standards for top service that could otherwise be a little sketchy.In between excursions, unwind on a cosy day bed at the wonderful main infinity edge pool that comes with glorious views of the lake and rice field below, or at the royal Lanna style spa hidden among the trees. Here the treatments are inspired by ancient Thai rituals using local herbs, spices and aromatic oils produced through traditional methods. Among the various chakra and blessing rituals, try a signature Royal Lanna signature treatment, which begins with silk strokes and silk glove massage, followed by an exfoliation using a blend of seven flowers, and a fruit and rose tea wrap finished with a massage and a touch of gold leaf on the hands and third eye (forehead). A heavenly fragrant experience that will leave you floating between consciousness and sleep for the treatment’s entire duration.Overall, the Four Seasons Chiang Mai provides a wonderful experience immersed in nature just a short drive from Chiang Mai’s crowds and tourist traps; and what the hotel lacked in service, it made up with its delectable Thai cuisine, bucolic pool villas, and glorious views. 5. 137 Pillars House, Chiang Mai The website doesn’t do justice to this refined and cosy colonial style boutique hideaway of 30 rooms. A slick and comfortable base for exploring Chiang Mai, the hotel is best suited to couples looking for peace and quiet while being a short tuk-tuk ride from the city centre. Set on a backstreet of the up-and-coming upscale riverside Wat Gate district, 137 Pillars House is far from the girl bars, cheap western restaurants, and endless weekend night markets. Instead, the quiet streets surrounding the hotel are dotted with a handful of trendy coffee shops and juice bars, smart boutiques and art galleries. The hotel comes top for location, style, and unique 19 th century ambience that is deep-rooted history.The original house was actually built in 1889 and was once owned by Louis Leonowens, son of Anna (of Anna and the King ). It was part of the headquarters for the East Borneo Company, which exported teak to the rest of the world, including the old Kingdom of Siam. And while Thailand was never colonised, the hotel boasts a tasteful colonial style in its open plan teak bungalows that lie where elephants once walked carrying logs to the river.Black and white photos illustrating the property’s trading past hang in the chic rooms, which come with four-poster beds, an outdoor shower and free-standing bath tub, as well as a wooden vintage tiled veranda looking out over the landscaped lawn below – the Louis Leonowens suites also have their own private plunge pools.Tucked away in a corner of the tiered garden dotted with elegant days beds, a high vertical garden wall provides the backdrop for the striking slab of turquoise pool perfect for unwinding; the hotel also has a small spa offering Thai massage. The restaurant is located in the centre of the compound in the original house, a beautiful raised bungalow (with 137 pillars) brimming with glorious soul from a time passed. Smart and cosy, it is adorned with ancient artefacts and the breezy lounge and library here will make you want to spend the day curled up in one of the sofas with a good book.Adjoining the lounge are the signature upscale dining room, and the all-day restaurant with Lanna accents in the wallpaper, lanterns, columns and baldaquin banquettes. The restaurant also has a central outdoor terrace where breakfast is served each morning. The staff, like personable waitor Khun Wittaya, is extremely friendly as is the Thai-born citizen of the world Chef Tithi. His hybrid east meets west cuisine blends the myriad influences he has come across in his numerous travels, providing a fresh culinary perspective. The 137 Pillars House is a laid-back boutique real sanctuary among the Chiang Mai furore, and is our top choice in the city for atmosphere, style, quality and comfort that comes with plenty of soul. 6. Six Senses, Koh Samui, Southeast Thailand Now 11 years in the running and one of the first properties in the growing eco-conscious luxury Six Senses collection, the Six Senses Samui was totally overhauled last July, ‘Even all the trees (all 20 acres of them) had to be uprooted and replanted them’, the staff told me when I visited. Located off the east coast of Thailand on Koh (island) Samui is no stranger to travellers looking for a cheap fix of sun, sea and Singha, however, with many five-star hotels having set up here it’s also a well-known haven for luxury lodgings. Far from the madding crowds, the Six Senses is located at the northern tip of the island hidden among the greenery, providing a perfect escape for guests in need of some down time between visiting cultural sites.Perched up above the sea in a jungle garden, with its villas staggered on a hillside, Six Senses Samui isn’t on the beach, however, each of the 59 villas comes with a pool and outdoor living area for sunbathing and taking in the marvellous vistas. For the utmost luxury and best view, we recommend an Ocean Front Pool Villa suite, which measuring all of 300m2, is big enough to get lost in. Each guests also has their own personal ‘gem’ (guest experience maker) on hand to satisfy their every whim.Sparkling new, the villas defintely have the wow-factor. Spacious and wrapped in windows boasting splendid jungles and ocean vistas, the space is extremely pleasant to lounge about in, making it hard to step outside. What's more, the adjoining bathroom comes with a huge sunken tub and outdoor shower, a space perfect for pampering with more of those wonderful views.For a change of scene and to get guests together, every Tuesday and Thursday the hotel staff host a complimentary cocktail by the main infinity edge pool, which boasts some of the area’s best views of the karst studded landscape draped with wispy clouds of pinks and purples at sunset. The hotel also has a wonderful Six Senses spa hiding among the trees, where each cabin boasts yet more of those superb ocean views. The staff are all Thai and know how to work any tired body back into shape.Being a little out of the way, the hotel has several dining options including Dining on the Hill (the all-day dining restaurant) and Dining on the Rocks, which is exactly that – dining on a wooden deck overhanging the sea. While the former serves Thai and Western cuisine, the latter focuses on Mediterranean with wine pairing. Where the food is concerned, it’s not the hotel’s strong point, but what the hotel lacks in the kitchen, it fully makes up for with its rooms and mesmerising ocean views. Six Senses Samui is overall a great romantic getaway for a few nights before getting back on the road and exploring the rest of the country. 7. Anantara Rasananda, Koh Phangan, Southeast Thailand Koh Phangan might be synonymous with Full Moon shenanigans, but far from party central in Hat Rin, a new kind of tourism has emerged. Located on the north east coast of the island on Thong Nai Pan Noi’s white sandy beach is upscale Anantara Phangan Rasananda . And while the service needs a little work and the layout can make things feel a little cramped at times, it’s on a sandy beach with transparent turquoise waters, has a gorgeous spa, and beautiful beachside villas that come with their own pool, making it the island’s best hotel.Anantara packs in 64 villas and suites with private plunge pools along a buzzy beach, so it’s not for those looking for utter seclusion, but it’s great if you like to keep things lively. It also backs onto a small pleasant village of shops and restaurants. And beyond that, it’s just glorious jungle than runs into secluded beaches.The rooms are arranged over two storeys and in two rows along the beach on either side of the main hub where the restaurant and beautiful main infinity edge pool are found. For the best experience, ask for a villa on the front row and on the ground floor so you have direct access to the beach. Inside, the villas are spacious, comfortable and well-appointed with all the usual mod-cons. And unarguably, being able to roll out of bed and step out onto the beach or lounge on your private poolside day bed while looking out at the iridescent waters, is a real point-scorer.The restaurant, where you literally eat with your feet in the sand, offers a varied menu of Thai and Western food – for something a little special though, book (in advance) a private dinner on the beach. After releasing your own lantern into the starry skies, the staff will guide you to your candle-lit nook set up on the beach where a special three-course menu is served. Try the Yam Mamuang Poo Nim appetizer of green mango and crisp soft shell crab, followed by stir fried king scallops with roasted sweet chili and basil alongside steamed coconut jasmine rice. And finish off with Kanon Mo Geang, a must-try baked yellow bean cake scented with jasmine and palm sugar with coconut sorbet.And what Anantara hotel would be complete without a spa? And what a beautiful, albeit compact, spa it is. Set on a small manmade pond of lotus flowers, the massage rooms are scattered across a cliff face – and while the higher ones do take a walk to get to, you are rewarded by better sea views. Go for a signature Thai massage, of which the local therapists make a grand job that will have you dozing off in no time. 8. Six Senses, Koh Yao Noi, Southwest Thailand If you ever wanted to feel like James Bond, then book yourself into the Six Senses Yao Noi , where the experience begins with an exhilarating high-speed 30-minute ride on board a slick white speedboat with super-comfortable daybeds - the hotel also has its own helipad for those who have a penchant for grander entrances. Set on one of Thailand’s most beautiful and less overrun islands, Yao Noi is a wonderful unadulterated mix of rice fields, fishing villages, small rubber plantations and wild seascapes. In fact, outside the hotel, you’d be hard pushed finding other tourists, making it the ideal beach getaway for guests wanting the best part of seclusion but local atmosphere too.Set in 24 acres of luxuriant leafy gardens, the 56 villas including two residences with jaw-dropping views, wind around a hill with the spectacular Hilltop Reserve – you’ve guessed it – at the top. The hotel, which we were told provided the template for Soneva Kiri, flew into our top three, first for its sustainable values and top-notch facilities as well as its rustic-chic timber villas and picture-perfect karst studded sea vistas. Ask for a villa with a private pool and ocean views on the sunset side of the island for the best experience.All rooms have a wonderfully comfortable king size bed, indoor and outdoor living areas as well as a beautiful open plan bathroom complete with sunken bath tub from which you can admire the views, and an outdoor shower. Meticulously designed, the villas have everything you need from [entity display=\"Bose\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"bose\" natural_id=\"fred/company/12694\"]Bose[/entity] surround-sound to a fresh lime, should you like to make yourself a gin and tonic or two.The hotel doesn’t just look good, service is also impeccable. Not only was our ‘gem’ (guest experience maker) Alice, friendly, efficient, and good at anticipating our needs, she could even finish off our sentences. Without being omnipresent, she made our experience seamless. And the stellar service is matched by the hotel facilities. Guests can book anything from Thai boxing lessons to exploring the spectacular Phang Nga Bay and its scenic islands like Koh Hong and its magical interior lagoon.After morning Pilates, indulge in breakfast at castaway chic The Dining Room – and make sure you come hungry. Lively with a relaxed ambience and those splendid views, the restaurant serves western and local cuisine (and mouth-watering Indian curries) in the evenings, as well as a magnificent spread for breakfast – expect a whole room just for freshly baked goodies. Guests can also go and collect their own eggs from the chicken coop where the hens run around listening to jazz music – that’s right, jazz. ‘It helps them to feel relaxed and therefore produce the freshest eggs,’ says a passionate and inspiring Pimmy, who runs the hotel’s sustainability and community work units.Sunbathe off breakfast at the beaches, where an open-air cinema is set up in the evenings, before lunch at the Hilltop Reserve where the sleek infinity edge pool boasts mesmerising panoramic views of the bay’s islands scattered across the horizon. After lounging by the pool, swing by the picturesque spa that’s suspended above luxuriant jungle – if you do only one thing, make it a Dream Catcher massage by therapist Jan. And it will probably be the best massage you’ve ever had. Focusing on the head, shoulders and back, the treatment - along with everything else at the hotel - was so good that it had us considering becoming live-in guests. 9. Amanpuri, Phuket, Southwest Thailand The first brick in the Aman hotel empire, Amanpuri ’s 27 years hardly shows. A landmark hotel for Phuket, where since a number of more contemporary rivals have emerged, it’s still the top choice for A-listers including none other than Beyoncé, who come for the privacy of Amanpuri’s enormous high-security lavish private residence villas. The 70-acre property actually encompasses two very distinct worlds: one of supersized villas and the other comprising the actual hotel of 40 pavilions.The hotel was pened in 1988 by Indonesian-born Adrian Zecha, and with Thailand and Indonesia’s seasons being opposite, Amanpuri was a haven where he could entertain his guests during Indonesia's rainy season. The 45 high-walled residence villas are staggered up a hill and situated away from prying eyes for the utmost intimacy; the staff on hand is even sworn to secrecy and prohibited from carrying mobile phones while on duty. Each villa belongs to a different owner, which is reflected in the décor of varying tastes. The views and space are the main highlights.The resort was entirely designed by Paris-based American designer Edward Tuttle, who blends ascetic chic with a luxurious traditional Thai style. Seemingly a little austere at first, the neutral palette grows on you and gives way to a still tranquillity. While it has been a multiple award-winning property over the last two decades, the hotel does however rest on its laurels, sadly letting service slide a little at times.The all-day Thai (I highly recommend the Thai breakfast) and Italian restaurants, and bar, are located around a cool slab of dark turquoise pool, while the pavilions branch off a concrete walkway that runs at tree top level. The best room? Number 105 without doubt. As it sits right at the end of the path it is the most private. Overhanging the sea, it has unobstructed dazzling views of Phuket Bay, which can be appreciated while lounging in your own private sala, the waves crashing underneath.The pavilions vary in décor but 105, which was part of the first batch of rooms to be built, is an ode to Thai craftsmanship. A medley of highly polished teak and rose wood teamed with mirrors, the open plan bedroom runs into the bathroom, the focal point being the large bath tub and the artefacts dotted around the room.Rather daunting, the main pool is almost just for show, while the two pools at the beach club and on the hotel beach are where guests like to have a dip when the sea is a little too rough. The hotel also boasts a Japanese restaurant as well as tennis courts, a large state-of-the-art gym, a library and a small spa where an expansion is on the cards.Sleek and chic Amanpuri has the best of both worlds for jet-setters who like to be seen and those who don’t, and while the hands off service can be off-putting, the serene ambience and top end facilities keep guests coming back for more.", "external_links": ["http://www.mandarinoriental.com/bangkok/", "http://www.soneva.com/soneva-kiri", "https://www.aman.com/resorts/amanpuri?gclid=CM-KsYvPlMgCFQ4rjgodm5gB1g&gclsrc=aw.ds", "http://www.fourseasons.com/chiangmai/", "http://www.sixsenses.com/resorts/yao-noi/destination", "http://www.137pillarshouse.com/", "http://phangan-rasananda.anantara.com/", "http://bangkok.peninsula.com/en/default", "http://www.sixsenses.com/resorts/samui/destination"], "published": "2015-10-01T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:17:12.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
