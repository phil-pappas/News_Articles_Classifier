Addazio considered using Gowins in the Eagles’ 9-7 loss at Duke on Oct. 3 but elected to hold him out.\nBut Addazio had run out of backfield options as the team prepared for Wake Forest.\n“We just felt going into this game that we had to get some power back in the backfield,” said Addazio. “It is like every other darn thing and we put him in there and you saw some of that and then he puts the ball on the ground.”\nGowins’ first carries came early in the second quarter and went for 6 and 4 yards to move the chains. He finished with 33 yards in eight carries with a fumble that ultimately cost BC the game.\nGowins gave up the football on the BC 5-yard line early in the third quarter. The Eagles defense stoned Wake Forest quarterback John Wolford , but kicker Mike Weaver delivered a 25-yard field goal for the only points in this ACC clash.\n“We had to get a bigger back in there and quite honestly I thought about putting him in at the end of the game,” said Addazio. “It has been awhile getting him ready to play and we played him and we are going to live with it.\n“We saw some good things and some freshman things and we have to get him ready to roll.”\nDouble down on ‘D’\nThe BC defense, which entered the game ranked No. 1 in the country, limited Wake Forest to 33 rushing yards on 28 carries. BC held the opposition to less than 100 yards rushing in every game this season.\nIn the passing game, Wolford completed 11-of-25 throws for 109 yards with an interception.\nBC recorded 11 tackles for a loss of 34 yards and has 54 stops for minus-217 yards on the season.\nMiddle linebacker Connor Strachan recorded his second interception of the season and free safety Justin Simmons recovered a fumble with 56 second remaining.\nDefensive end Mehdi Abdesmad had a career high 2.5 tackles for a loss while senior tackle Connor Wujciak had the Eagles lone sack.\nReal false start\nThe Eagles’ first drive of the game was truly an exercise in futility courtesy of the offensive line.\nKick returner Michael Walker did his part with a 41-yard return that gave BC the ball on the 42.\nQuarterback Troy Flutie ’s first pass attempt was batted down. Outlow followed with an 8-yard run to set up a manageable third-down situation. BC lost 15 yards without taking a snap on three consecutive false starts. The drive ended on a 14-yard scramble by Flutie.\n“I’m seeing a lot of things I haven’t seen before to be quite honest with you,” said Addazio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:37:26.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
