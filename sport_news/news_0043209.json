(AP Photo/Alan Diaz) Veteran NFL coach Al Saunders — who was head coach of San Diego from 1986-88 and offensive coordinator for Kansas City, St. Louis, Baltimore and Oakland — will serve as a senior offensive assistant.\nHe will assist Lazor, who’s overseeing a struggling offense, while working heavily with Miami’s receivers.\nBut Campbell, promoted from tight ends coach to head coach on Monday in place of the fired Joe Philbin, said he’s still getting a feel for the defense and is undecided on Coyle’s fate.\nAlan Diaz Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle watches the players as he walks on the field during NFL football practice Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015, in Davie, Fla. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz) “I’m in the evaluation process right now,” Campbell said. “I am looking at everything I can look at. I feel like I’m turning over every stone I can turn over at this point with where we’re at.\n“I’d love to say that, ‘Hey, we’re going to have this thing done immediately.’ That’s just not reality. I understand that I have to. We’re running out of time. But I can’t rush with it either. I’ve got to make sure I’m making the best decision I can for the Miami Dolphins.”\nA report from NFL.com said that the Dolphins have discussed hiring former head coaches Greg Schiano, Jim Schwartz and Mike Smith to help out on defense. It’s unclear if the Dolphins envision them as defensive coordinator or a consultant.\nMiami’s defense has regressed this year, despite the addition of All-Pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. The Dolphins are giving up 25.3 points per game (19th of 32 teams) and have one sack. No other team has fewer than five sacks.\nThe Dolphins are on their bye week and won’t play until Oct. 18 at Tennessee. At 1-3, they likely would need to finish 9-3 to earn a playoff berth.\n“I’m still trying to figure out the staff, I’m still trying to make sure that I’m making the right decision there,” said Campbell, at 39 the youngest head coach in the NFL.\n“At some point, I’ve got to go through X’s and O’s obviously and we’re going to have to walk through that stuff and make sure that anything that needs to be cleaned up, that’s happened over the last four weeks, gets addressed. But that’s on the back burner right now.”\nMiami’s offense has struggled over the first four games.\nLazor entered his second season with Miami as a hot commodity. The Dolphins were 11th in the NFL in scoring last year and quarterback Ryan Tannehill appeared to be on the rise.\nBut through four games, the Dolphins are 30th of 32 teams in scoring (16.3 points per game), 31st in rushing (69.3 yards per game) and last in rushing attempts (65).\nSaunders was assistant head coach in Washington a decade ago when Lazor was a young quarterbacks coach.\nCampbell said Saunders, 68, will work primarily with the receivers but will be involved in the overall offensive plan.\nReceivers coach Ken O’Keefe was re-assigned to work with the quarterbacks.\n“Al is a guy that brings a ton of energy, which you wouldn’t think that — it’s not like he’s the youngest man alive or anything,” Campbell said. “But he has a ton of experience. He has a ton of energy. He understands what this offense, particularly the pass game, is supposed to look like.\n“The other thing about having Al in, it’s only going to help Bill Lazor be a better offensive coordinator. There’s little things that he’ll be able to help him on.”\nWhile Saunders will work with the receivers, Campbell said assistant receivers coach Phil McGeoghan will run the receivers room. But the team hasn’t removed his assistant title.\nBen Johnson, previously Campbell’s assistant, was promoted to tight ends coach.\nMike Wahle, a former Pro Bowl offensive lineman with Carolina, was promoted from sports performance assistant to assistant tight ends coach.\nTannehill said the early season offensive woes are on the players, and not the coaches.\n“Of course there will be tweaks,” Tannehill said. “But no matter what the tweaks are — you can draw up the best play on paper — and if you don’t go out and execute it and block it or throw it and catch it the way it’s supposed to be done, then you’re back at square one.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/07/22/22/Dolphins-New-Coach-Football.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/07/9d/03/coyle-1007.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:54:52.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
