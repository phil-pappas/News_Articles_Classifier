Nine signature shoes entering your 11th NBA season​ will do that. ​ So will staying intimately involved in the design process all along the way. For Paul every signature Jordan shoe does more than tell a story. Each sneaker tells all kinds of stories, in all kinds of colors, with all kinds of nuances. That’s the joy of having a signature sneaker.\nAhead of the launch of Paul’s ninth signature shoe from Jordan Brand—and the L.A. Clippers preseason trip to China—the All-Star guard took a break from Southern California training to speak to SI.com about all things sneakers.\n• MORE NBA: Jordan unites Clippers' Paul, yellow dragon\nSI.com: What do people see when they look at the lineup of all nine shoes?\nChris Paul: “I think, obviously, if I looked at nine shoes, I see the difference. I see my career. I can see the different things I was going through. Every shoe tells a story. I can look at the fours and remember where I was. I remember the entire process of making the shoe: the threes with the names and stuff, the fours and fives and (going) low and talking about getting quicker. Over the evolution of the shoe, I also pay attention to the materials. Even the ones—the very first shoe I ever had—at the time I thought it was God’s gift to man to have a pair of shoes like that and now I think about the materials that go into a shoe and how far it has come.”\nSI.com: What part of process do you get most involved in?\nPaul: “I’m really big into the comfort aspect of my shoe. I wear a different pair of shoes every game. When I was a kid people used to say, ‘I gotta break them in.’ I try to design a shoe that is wearable straight from the store—take them out of the box and go play.\n“The thing I get most excited about in the design phase is the cool little nuances of the shoes. I’ve been into sneakers and shoes for a long time. The coolest thing was the Jordan 23s, on the inside of the tongue—nine of 10 times the first thing you do is pull up the tongue—was MJ’s thumbprint on the inside of the tongue of the 23s. Even though it seems like a small aspect, every time you tied up the pair, even for a split second, when you touched that thumbprint you felt like Michael Jordan. Little nuances are why I feel so blessed and fortunate to have my own shoe. I put little things that represent my family and me and who I am. There are a lot of times in a shoe you see a design and for most people it may be a symbol, when I see it, I see my college coach who passed away—Skip Prosser—on one of my shoes, my kids’ birthdays, my wife and my anniversary.”\nNBA Harden's superstar summer: $200M shoe deal, NBA 2K16 cover and more by Jeremy Woo", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/tdnewcomb"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:39:26.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
