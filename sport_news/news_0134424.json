The league experimented with distributing coverage primarily through streaming for the first time for the matchup from London. Yahoo said Monday that 15.2 million unique viewers watched for any length of time. About a third of the audience was international. Because Sunday's experiment was the first of its kind, there isn't an easy comparison between the streaming numbers and any previous sports broadcasts. Jacksonville's wild 34-31 win over Buffalo on Sunday, which started at 9:30 a.m. EDT, was available only through Yahoo worldwide everywhere other than the two home markets, where it was televised on CBS.
