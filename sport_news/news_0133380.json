Michel Platini might never even get there.\nTwo of the most powerful men in soccer were handed 90-day suspensions by the FIFA ethics committee on Thursday, essentially ending Blatter’s 17-year reign as president and likely stunting Platini’s chances of replacing him.\nSepp Blatter\nBoth Blatter and Platini, former allies who turned into rivals in the buildup to the most recent FIFA presidential election, have become embroiled in a Swiss criminal investigation. Blatter has been labeled a suspect and questioned by authorities, while Platini was said to be somewhere between a witness and a suspect.\nBoth maintain their innocence.\n“President Blatter looks forward to the opportunity to present evidence that will demonstrate that he did not engage in any misconduct, criminal or otherwise,” Blatter’s lawyer, Richard Cullen, said in a statement.\nPlatini also pledged to fight the decision, calling the allegations against him “astonishingly vague” in a statement sent from UEFA hours after the Frenchman was banned from working as the body’s president.\n“I want everyone to know my state of mind: More than a sense of injustice or a desire for revenge, I am driven by a profound feeling of staunch defiance,” Platini said. “I am more determined than ever to defend myself before the relevant judicial bodies.”\nThe statement from UEFA, which stressed “its full confidence” in Platini, has exposed the body’s officials to potential action under FIFA ethics rules. According to UEFA statutes, Platini should have been replaced by Angel Maria Villar, the highest-ranking vice president.\n“(Platini) is currently suspended and will therefore not perform his official duties for the time being,” UEFA said in a statement, still referring to Platini as president. “UEFA is fully aware of its responsibilities under the relevant provisions of the statutes.”\nUEFA’s 54 member nations are due to meet in Nyon, Switzerland, next Thursday to discuss the worst crisis in its history and the bid by Platini to succeed Blatter.\nThe 90-day suspensions for Blatter and Platini were imposed after the Swiss authorities started investigating a payment from FIFA to the former France midfield great in 2011 for work carried out at least nine years earlier.\nAnother presidential hopeful, Chung Mong-joon, was suspended for six years in a separate case and FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke was banned for 90 days.\nThe suspensions can be extended by up to 45 days.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:44:22.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
