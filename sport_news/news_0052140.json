The Sand Lizards followed that with their longest drive of the game with their starters in, capping a six-play drive with a 14-yard toss from Elyas Carter to Kershner that made it 17-0. \nDardanelle held the ball for only 2:02 in the second quarter but still managed four touchdowns, with Kershner turning two short dump-offs into long scores and scooping up a fumble that he returned 29 yards for another score. \nThe first-team defense held the Baptist Prep (0-6, 0-3), formerly Arkansas Baptist, to minus-3 yards rushing while giving up 230 passing yards but held the Eagles to six points. \n\"We needed a game like this against a spread team to get our D-backs, linebackers and those guys some reps against a live deal,\" Price said. \"I was very pleased with those guys.\" \nPULASKI ROBINSON 55, \nSUBIACO ACADEMY 0 \nSUBIACO — Quarterback Brennen Johnson passed for three touchdowns and running back Myles Fells added two more scores on the ground as Pulaski Robinson (6-0, 3-0 4-4A) shut out Subiaco Academy (2-4, 0-3). \nJohnson’s scoring throws went to T.J. Hammonds, Tonda Bullock and Trenton Dunn. Fells scored on runs of 25 yards and 16 yards and finished with 130 yards on 9 carries. \nHammonds, Nick Harper and Shumar Blair also had rushing touchdowns for the Senators. \nNASHVILLE 69, WALDRON 7 \nWALDRON — Trent Harris accounted for three touchdowns as Nashville (6-0, 3-0 7-4A) rolled over Waldron (0-6, 0-3). Davion Holmes had two rushing touchdowns, and Leonard Snell passed for a touchdown and rushed for another. Darious Hopkins added a touchdown for the Scrappers. \nASHDOWN 20, MALVERN 14 \nASHDOWN — Tre Green scored with 17 seconds left in the game to lead Ashdown (5-1, 3-0) to a 7-4A conference victory over Malvern (4-2, 2-1). \nIn the first quarter, Ashdown took a 6-0 lead after Jaden Hill ran for a 1-yard touchdown. After a missed PAT, Malvern answered with a 35-yard touchdown pass from Trace Collie to Amari Reed to take a 7-6 lead. \nIn the second quarter, Hill threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Northcross to put Ashdown ahead 12-7, then threw a two-point conversion pass to Cameron Solomon to make the score 14-7 at halftime. \nIn the third quarter, Malvern tied the score at 14-14 after Devin Shaw scored on a 1-yard run, and the Leopards’ PAT was good. But Green’s 13-yard run in the fourth quarter sealed the victory for Ashdown. \nWARREN 63, DUMAS 34 \nDUMAS — Junior running back Dennis Daniels rushed for five touchdowns and junior quarterback Hayden Lassiter threw for three more scores as Warren (5-1, 3-0 8-4A) defeated Dumas (3-3, 0-3). \nThe Lumberjacks set the tone early with Daniels running 50 yards for his first touchdown and Lassiter throwing his first touchdown pass, which went 23 yards to Franklin Gilmore, to give Warren a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. \nLassiter’s 22-yard touchdown pass to Treylon Burks to open the second quarter built the lead to 21-0. The Lumberjacks and Badgers traded touchdowns the rest of the half with Daniels rushing 29 yards and 6 yards for scores and Lassiter throwing a 28-yard touchdown pass to Keemontrae McKnight. \nWarren led 42-21 at halftime. \nDaniels scored two more touchdowns in the third quarter, both on 1-yard runs. Desean Jackson wrapped up the scoring for the Lumberjacks with a 55-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. \nHAMBURG 24, STAR CITY 16 \nHAMBURG — Stetson Selby passed for two touchdowns and John Wilson rushed for another to help Hamburg (5-1, 3-0 8-4A) defeat Star City (3-3, 1-2). \nHamburg’s Allen Lemus kicked a 30-yard field goal, which was the only points for either team in the first half. \nSelby finished the night with 123 yards through the air, including a 19-yard touchdown pass to Lorenzo Walker. Wilson’s 149 yards on 14 carries included an 82-yard run. \nJaylen Mallett scored on a 3-yard run, Blake Wynn returned a punt 41 yards for another touchdown and Andy Magana kicked a 31-yard field goal to account for Star City’s points. \nTye Brown had 359 yards passing for the Bulldogs. \nSports on 10/10/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:07:38.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
