(AP) Pinkman cruised at the start and took over in the stretch to win the $527,000 Kentucky Futurity for 3-year-old trotters at The Red Mile on Saturday. \nThe winning margin was 1 1/4 lengths over long shot Crescent Fashion, with Pinkman covering the mile in 1:51.2. French Laundry was third. \nThe triumph gave trainer Jimmy Takter's Pinkman wins in two of the three trotting triple crown races. Pinkman won the Hambletonian at the Meadowlands, but Habitat won the Yonkers Trot, the second leg. \nPinkman raced in third for nearly three-quarters of a mile before challenging leader Crazy Wow on the final turn. He pulled away from the field in the stretch before holding off Crescent Fashion to win. \nSent off at 2-1 odds, Pinkman paid $6.20 to win. Pinkman has won 11 of 15 races this year and earned $1.75 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:56:33.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
