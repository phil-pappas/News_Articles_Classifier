He is a New Orleans native whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina a decade ago. \nThe NCAA quickly erased questions about whether it would be a violation and said on its verified Twitter account that Fournette would be permitted to offer the jersey for charity. \nLSU treated South Carolina like the home team after severe flooding forced the game to be moved to Tiger Stadium.
