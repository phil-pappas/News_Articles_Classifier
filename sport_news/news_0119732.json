Held annually on the first Sunday in November, the race features the world's top professional athletes and a vast range of competitive, recreational, and charity runners.

In 2014, a record 50,530 runners from 130 countries toured New York City's five boroughs, including the one-millionth finisher in the history of the event, starting on Staten Island at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and running through the neighborhoods of Brooklyn , Queens , and the Bronx , before ending in Manhattan at the iconic Central Park finish line. More than one million spectators line the city streets to cheer on the runners, while millions more watch the live television broadcast in the United States and around the world. The race is part of the Abbott World Marathon Majors, a series featuring the world's top marathons-Tokyo, Boston , London , Berlin , Chicago , and New York-and crowning the top professional male and female marathoners of the series.
