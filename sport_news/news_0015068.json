Enemy camp: 5 questions with an ASU beat writer “ Arizona State seems to be hitting its stride. They're coming off of a couple nice wins and they're playing well right now. They have good athletes. It should be a great ballgame.”\nUte coach Kyle Whittingham\nSALT LAKE CITY — Before the start of the 2015 season, big things were expected of the Arizona State football team. Many experts picked the Sun Devils to win the Pac-12 South Division and a few even had them making it to the College Football Championship playoffs.\nThen the season began and the Sun Devils quickly knocked themselves out of any playoff consideration with big losses to Texas A&M and USC . They also looked shaky in non-conference wins over Cal Poly and New Mexico.\nHowever, the Sun Devils appear to have righted their ship with impressive victories the last two weeks over UCLA on the road, and Colorado at home and they'll present a big challenge to the No. 4-ranked Utah football team Saturday night (8 p.m.) in Rice-Eccles Stadium.\n“Arizona State seems to be hitting its stride,’’ said Ute coach Kyle Whittingham. “They're coming off of a couple nice wins and they're playing well right now. They have good athletes. It should be a great ballgame.\"\nASU is one of just two teams (Washington is the other) that the Utes have yet to beat since joining the Pac-12 Conference four years ago. Not only that, the Utes haven’t beaten the Sun Devils in 11 tries, dating back to 1976.\nThe Utes came very close the last two years, losing 20-19 in 2013 when the Sun Devils scored two touchdowns in the final quarter and last year when they lost in overtime at Tempe 19-16 when usually-reliable Andy Phillips missed a field goal.\nASU coach Todd Graham knows what he’s up against in facing the Utes in Salt Lake after barely surviving the past two seasons.\n“I’m so impressed, I am every year,’’ he said. “This game has come down to the last series, and last year the last play. We went into overtime and won on a field goal. Coach Whittingham does a tremendous job. They're very disciplined. (I like) the desire and the heart that they play with and how hard they play.’’\nThe Sun Devils started off with that 38-17 loss to Texas A&M and found themselves tied with Cal Poly midway through the fourth quarter before winning 35-21. The next week they led New Mexico just 3-0 in the final minute of the first half, before breaking away for a 34-10 win.\nThen came the 42-14 beatdown by USC in Tempe when ASU trailed 35-0 at halftime. However, the last two weeks the Sun Devils looked much better with a 38-23 road victory at UCLA and a 48-23 home win against Colorado.\nQuarterback Mike Bercovici, who started several games last year, has improved as the season has gone along and ranks 11th in the country in passing touchdowns and 15th in completions and passing yards. He’s also getting better protection from his offensive line, which after allowing nine sacks in the season opener, has given up just seven sacks the past five games.\nThe defense is led by junior linebacker Salamo Fiso, who leads the Pac-12 in sacks and tackles for loss. Fiso is second on the team in tackles with 50, one behind Jordan Simone, a senior safety who has two of the team’s six interceptions this year.\nOne place the Sun Devils excel is in defending the rush. They have allowed just 138 yards per game, which is fourth-best in the Pac-12 and 45th in the nation. In the win over UCLA, they held Paul Perkins, considered one of the two best backs in the league along with Utah’s Devontae Booker, to just 63 yards on 18 attempts.\nOn the other hand, ASU has been vulnerable through the air as it showed last week when Colorado threw for 401 yards with plays of 68, 67 and 42 yards. The Utes might be relying more on quarterback Travis Wilson’s passing this week to go along with the running of Booker, who is ninth in the nation in rushing at 133 yards per game.\nNOTES: Next week, the Utes head down to Southern California to take on USC, Saturday at 5:30 p.m. MT, while the Sun Devils have a bye before facing Oregon at home in a Thursday night game on Oct. 29 . . . Demario Richard leads the ASU rushing attack with 529 yards on the season . . . Utah’s last victory over Arizona State came during the 3-8, 1976 season when the Utes knocked off the Sun Devils 31-28 in Tempe.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team91.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:16:14.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
