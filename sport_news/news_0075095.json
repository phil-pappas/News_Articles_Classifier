Now, led by a new head coach and a new attitude, the Bucs find themselves atop the Henlopen South Division at the halfway point of their schedule. On Friday night, Milford improved to 4-1 on the season defeating Seaford going away, 41-0. The Bucs found ways to score on offense, defense, and special teams in their first divisional matchup of the season. Sophomore back David Bowman led the way for the Bucs against Seaford, finding the end-zone four times in the victory. Freshman Rahshawn Price scored the only other offensive touchdown for Milford, scoring from close in from the goal line. On defense, senior Michael Holstein intercepted a Seaford pass returning for a long score. Meanwhile, not to be left out of the mix, the special teams chipped in with a punt-return touchdown from senior Rakwon Williams. Milford’s offense continued to click on Friday night; the Bucs have scored 36 points or more in three of their four games (67, 42, and 36). Defensively, Milford posted their second shutout of the season against Seaford. They’ve allowed just 21 points total this season, and just seven over their last two games. The win Friday night makes it three victories in a row for the Bucs who go on the road next week to take on Indian River. The Indians sit at 2-3 on the year fresh off an upset win over Laurel Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:21:47.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
