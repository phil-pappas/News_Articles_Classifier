Williams, a junior from Flossmoor, Illinois, redshirted in 2014-15 after transferring from Samford University. As a sophomore, he earned All-SoCon first-team honors while leading the Bulldogs in points (17.6) and rebounds (7.5). Williams shot 60.3 percent from the field, a figure that ranked seventh nationally. In his first collegiate season, Williams earned SoCon Freshman of the Year honors after averaging 14.2 points and 7.1 rebounds per contest. In two seasons with the Bulldogs, he scored in double digits in 58 games. The Lobos finished 15-16 overall in 2014-15 with a 7-11 conference record.
