No. 1 Circle (28-10) El Dorado- The Cats’ are led by first year head coach Chelsea Helena who has changed the mindset of a program that has struggled in recent years. The Wildcats field a varsity roster of 11 and all seem to step up at different times. El Dorado relies on seniors Kayln Beel and Destiny Smith along with junior Caedyn Reinhardt, however the whole team seems to contribute each game. Senior Olivia Peiffer has emerged as a strong right side hitter while junior Colbi Phillips leads the Cats’ defensively. Others to keep an eye on include Braylon Daniels, Morgan Owens and Sydney Scanlon. Circle- The T-Birds are coached by future Hall of Famer Shelly Nibarger who has amassed over 700 wins in her 26 seasons at Circle. She has led 10 teams to state and will rely on a core group to try and get back for the 11th time. Andie Nibarger, Reagan Wilson, Caylie Kifer, Haleigh Trumpp, Emily Dennison, Kaityln Tosh and powerful middle Ashley Warehime have led Circle to 28 wins and dominated for much of the season. Circle has defeated top teams Andale and Collegiate this season. The T-Birds won the only matchup with El Dorado this season in two sets (25-18, 26-24). Andover Central (20-19) v Augusta (20-17) Andover Central- The Jaguars have played a tough schedule this season loaded with 5A competition. Head coach Rachel Tyner will rely on Brooklyn Strobel, Beth Schulte, Hannah Cole and Amanda Kakoulias to advance the Jags’ to state. Augusta- The Orioles are peaking at the perfect time this season. After early struggles, the O’s rattled off several wins to claim the two-seed including an upset over Collegiate Tuesday night. Augusta is led by Sophie and Clarice Dalziel, Faith and Maddie Hallmark and libero Riley Zerr. The Orioles have played in several three-set matches, so they’ll be ready for that situation if need be.
