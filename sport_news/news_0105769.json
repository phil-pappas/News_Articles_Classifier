You have to want to be the guy that wants to be out there, whether it’s late in the game or in overtime or in shootouts,” said Calgary Flames winger Joe Colborne, one of the heroes of Friday night’s 3-2 overtime triumph against the Detroit Red Wings at the Saddledome. \n“If you don’t want to be that guy, then I think you’re in the wrong sport.” \nOn this night, Colborne was one of those guys. \nWhen Flames netminder Jonas Hiller beetled to \nthe bench with just 90 seconds remaining in regulation time and the locals trailing 2-1, Colborne got the tap. \nHe made the most of it. \nThe 25-year-old forward rubbed out Red Wings defenceman Niklas Kronwall on the forecheck then retrieved the puck behind the net and slid a pass to Flames captain Mark Giordano at the blueline. \nWhen Giordano fired a wrister, there was Colborne again, parked in the perfect spot to tie it up with a deflection. \nHis first goal/point of the season — Colborne missed the first five contests due to a broken thumb — couldn’t have come at a better time. \n“I was fortunate enough \nfor the coaches to throw \nme over to take Hills when he changed, but it could \nhave been one of about nine or 10 guys on the bench \nthat brought their best \neffort of the year,” Colborne \nsaid. \n“I’m expecting that there’ll be someone else coming up big next game.” \nAROUND THE BOARDS \nHere’s some encouraging news for the Flames, who earned their second victory of the season against the Red Wings: One year ago, on Oct. 24, the Winnipeg Jets were 2-5-0. They rebounded from that sluggish start to claim the final wildcard playoff berth in the Western Conference. During the 2013-14 NHL campaign, both the New York Rangers and Columbus Blue Jackets opened at 2-5-0 but clawed back to earn invites to the spring dance. In fact, the Rangers advanced all the way to the Stanley Cup final … Flames LW Micheal Ferland retreated to the locker room in obvious pain after bumping Red Wings C Tomas Tatar along the boards in Friday’s second period and did not return. It’s a lower-body injury, but we don’t yet know the severity … Now that wasn’t very Lady Byng-like! Flames RW Jiri Hudler, who was saluted for his sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct — and lost his shoes — at the NHL’s awards gala last season, scrapped with Red Wings LW Landon Ferraro in Friday’s opening period. In 610 previous NHL contests, the 31-year-old Hudler had never had a fighting major, although he did skirmish once during his campaign with Dynamo Moscow of the KHL in ’09-10. \nOFF THE GLASS \nFlames LW Johnny Gaudreau had a pair of assists in Friday’s win. With nine points so far, he’s factored in on 60% of the Flames’ 15 markers this fall. Impressive stuff … In his first game in 277 days, Flames D Ladislav Smid registered four blocked shots in 8:05 of action against the Wings. “I thought that he was very effective,” said Flames head coach Bob Hartley of Smid, who had neck surgery last winter. “It’s a great way to come back”… A testament to both the patience of the organization and the training-camp performance of this youngster, C Dylan Larkin is the first teenager to crack the Red Wings’ opening night lineup in a quarter-century. He’s the first teen to play for the Wings, period, since Hudler suited up for a dozen contests as a 19-year-old back in ’03 … Friday marked Hockey Fights Cancer Awareness Night at the Saddledome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:34:18.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
