Tilton/NASCAR via Getty Images (NEW YORK) — Kyle Busch and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were not happy with how the \"Contender Round\" of the Sprint Cup Series' Chase began over the weekend.Both believed that remnants of a Justin Allgaier oil spill on lap 182 during the race at Charlotte caused them to strike a wall.Busch targeted NASCAR, sarcastically saying, \"You can't pass anybody — it's a single-lane race track and then [a driver] put oil on the top lane [where we] to try to make anything happen and then you put yourself in the fence — so thanks to NASCAR for cleaning that up,\" ESPN.com reports .\"I've raced this [stuff] for 20 years,\" Earnhardt said. \"I know what oil and [the absorbent] Speedi Dri is. We hit fluid, flew into the freaking wall hard. That's not Speedi Dri. There was oil up there....I hit the f***ing wall.\"I know I hit oil. I hit it. I promise. I'll argue with them all day long because I know I'm right.\"A NASCAR executive said cleanup workers felt no oil in the area in question.Busch is now 10th in the standings, Earnhardt 11th.Copyright   Tuesday, October 13, 2015 at 5:25AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:18:53.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
