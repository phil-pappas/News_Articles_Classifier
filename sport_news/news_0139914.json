I think that is the bigger thing. \n“I have confidence we will be on the grid, but the concern is can we be competitive? \n“This year, we have got a couple of podiums which is nice, but certainly not enough to keep us extremely happy. \n“We want to be competitive again and I think that is just as important as being on the grid.” Daniel Ricciardo says there is no point being in F1 if you’re not competitive. \nRed Bull has said it may pull out of F1 next year if it does not have a competitive engine after being frustrated by current supplier Renault’s poor power units. \nIt served notice on ending its agreement with Renault in July, but may consider continuing with the French company after failing in bids to secure a supply of power units from Mercedes and Ferrari. \nAll the teams will be watching the weather this weekend, with the potential for heavy rain that could disrupt practice and qualifying Friday and Saturday. \nSome forecasts also call for rain Sunday. \n“If we can start toward the front, I think we can stay there ... if we’re not floating down the river,” said Ricciardo, who drove his Red Bull car to third place in Austin a year ago. \nLewis Hamilton has been handed a boost in his quest to be crowned a three-time world champion in Austin after Sebastian Vettel was hit with a 10-place grid penalty for Sunday’s race. \nHamilton needs to outscore Ferrari driver Vettel by nine points and his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg by two points to become the first Briton to win back-to-back championships. \nIndeed if Hamilton wins — at a circuit in which he has triumphed in two of the last three seasons — and Vettel is third or lower, the 30-year-old will win the title with three races to spare. \nAnd on Thursday, Hamilton’s path to glory was made easier after it was revealed that Vettel and his Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen will be demoted 10 places on the grid after taking on a new engine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:01:46.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
