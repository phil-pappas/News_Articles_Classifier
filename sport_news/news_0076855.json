Every club has to face that.”\nYet for all of RSL’s attrition — and despite the fact that Salt Lake will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2007 — the Sounders’ regular-season finale is tricky for a number of reasons.\nMost Read Stories The veteran core that remains in Utah is a stubbornly prideful group. \nRSL won four of six matches down the stretch, even as its postseason hopes began to flicker. Kyle Beckerman’s control of the midfield has waned since Salt Lake phased out its trademark diamond formation, but there’s a reason he continues to earn national-team call-ups. Goalkeeper Nick Rimando has improbably allowed fewer goals this season than in any campaign since 2010.\n“Nobody is going to expect Salt Lake to roll over and play dead,” Schmid said. “Their character and their history is too good for that to happen. Our guys are aware of that and know we have to come to play.”\nReal Salt Lake has nothing to gain with a win Sunday, but that also means it has nothing to lose.\nDifferent teams have handled elimination in varying ways these past few weeks. Eastern Conference also-rans Philadelphia and Chicago gave up four goals apiece last weekend, the Union surrendering the opening goal just seven seconds into its match against the Red Bulls when it knocked the kickoff into Mike Grella’s path to set up a breakaway.\nYet last-place Colorado again underlined the league’s inherent unpredictably Wednesday, when it stunned playoff-chasing Sporting Kansas City 2-0 despite finishing the game with 10 men.\nThe plot of Wednesday’s match at Sporting Park was instructive as a blueprint that RSL will try to emulate.\nKansas City controlled the match from start to finish but failed to net the all-important first goal. Colorado gradually grew more ambitious on the counter. The opening goal came on the break, multiple Rapids sprinting through an overwhelmed back line.\nThe opening half hour of Sunday’s match will set the tone. If the Sounders can go in front early and force Salt Lake to commit numbers, maybe the visitors will wilt. If the Sounders start to labor, though, they’ll leave themselves open to a goal that could knock them out of the playoffs.\n“You can’t say, ‘This is a big game, so just turn it up,’ ” Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei said. “You’ve been trying to get points all along. With Kansas City, they were at home, they knew that had to put on pressure. But when you pressure and pour men forward, then you leave space behind.”\nPlayoff scenarios Though a win guarantees a seventh consecutive postseason berth and might lead to a drastic improvement in seeding, the Sounders could qualify even if they lose Sunday.\nSan Jose must win at first-place Dallas to retain any chance of leapfrogging the Sounders and entering the playoff picture. Depending on results elsewhere, the Sounders could finish anywhere from second and seventh place.\nFor the first time in league history, all the regular-season finales are kicking off simultaneously and are divided by conference. \nFull squad Though some players will be limited to less than 90 minutes, Schmid said all of the Sounders should be available Sunday in some capacity.\nStarting left back Oniel Fisher and winger Marco Pappa have been dealing with hamstring injuries, and forward Nelson Valdez is recovering from a calf strain. \n“We’re still being cautious with (Valdez), but he’ll definitely be part of the group,” Schmid said.\nMatt Pentz: 206-464-3184 or mpentz@seattletimes.com .
