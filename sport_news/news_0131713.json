He botched two makeable field goals, and his team dropped a 23-20 game in overtime to the Ravens when their kicker showed him how it's done. It is likely that many Steelers fans were less than pleased with his performance, but not many Steelers fans have an outlet to express their anger to a large audience. Snoop Dogg happens to be a Steelers fan who has a large audience, and he took to his Instagram account (along with its 6.7 million followers) to let his uncensored thoughts on Scobee be known. It remains to be seen if Steelers brass also believes Scobee to be a \"sorry motherfucker,\" but if they do it's likely they too will say \"Bye bye, bitch\" to him just a month after they acquired him from Jacksonville for a draft pick.\n[via Instagram ]\n ", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/8UeP5WP9Gq/?taken-by=snoopdogg"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:24:11.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
