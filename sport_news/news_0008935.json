Clay, recently. \n“He said we are 3-0 when we have all our linemen. We are 0-4 with those linemen hurt,” Clay said. “That’s what we’ve had to deal with.” \nStaying healthy always involves a bit of luck for high school football teams and Heritage hasn’t had much of it while trying to defend its GISA Region 1-AAA title. A 12-10 loss at Loganville Christian had one standout senior — linebacker Cody Chastain — out of the lineup and another — end Cole Jones — leaving the game due to a separated shoulder. \nThe Hawks still managed to take a 10-0 lead only to watch Loganville put together a late field-goal in the closing seconds. \nHeritage now takes a 2-1 region record into Friday’s homecoming game against Holy Spirit (3-4, 2-2), which was also off last week following a 28-7 loss to Trinity Christian. Following a tough loss, the Hawks’ bye week might have come at a perfect time, with games against Holy Spirit, Dominion and Trinity Christian remaining. \nA chance to host a state playoff game, as well as grab a share of the region title is still possible for Heritage, though it will need help on Oct. 23 from Trinity when it hosts Loganville. \n“It gave us a time away from football a little bit to clear your mind, which was was good for me as well,” Clay said. “We have the longest preseason and once the season starts, it goes so fast.” \nThe bye week also gave Chastain, Jones and some other injured players like sophomore Hays Burns, a chance to rest up. Jones was diagnosed with a separated shoulder, but could be back by Friday’s game with a two-week recovery window according to Clay. \nA positive, though, has been the role that freshmen and sophomores — many of whom played on successful middle-school lineups at Heritage — have played while gaining valuable playing time through the first seven games of the season. \n“The thing is you have inexperienced players out there and that’s the negative, but the positive is, those guys are getting action and they’re more comfortable,” Clay said. “I’ve seen it this year. Most of our seniors played in the state championship game two years ago for us. I’m excited to be able to play as many guys as we’re able to play. It just increases our chances each week.” \nHoly Spirit’s offense has been hit or miss. The Cougars scored at least 30 points in wins over Bethlehem Christian and Griffin Christian. But in losses against Loganville and Trinity, Holy Spirit managed just one score combined. \n“They’re a triple-option team. I’m a fan of Georgia Tech and I played at Georgia Southern, so I know what the option can do to a team if they fail to play assignment football,” Clay said. “We’re playing defense [in practice] without a football so we’re making sure where they need to be at, and who to tackle. They run a 4-4 on defense and they like to do a lot of blitzing. They try to take you out of rhythm.” \nDespite being unable to hold a lead against unbeaten Loganville in a game that could have decided this year’s region champion, Clay knows there’s still plenty left to play for starting this week. \n“I told those guys are you going to go into the tank and lose three in a row, because we’ve seen teams do that in college,” he said. “[I told them] ‘What are you going to do? Are you going to go and make this season count? Because right now we still have a chance to host a playoff game.’” More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:47:13.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
