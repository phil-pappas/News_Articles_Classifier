(AP) — Deshawn Salter ran for a career-high 233 yards and two touchdowns and Yale beat Lehigh 27-12 on Saturday. \nYale (3-0) took its opening drive 66 yards in nine plays, culminating in Salter’s 2-yard touchdown run. They added a pair of Bryan Holmes field goals and led 13-0 at the half. \nLehigh (2-3) opened the second half with a 9-play, 77-yard drive, capped by Nick Shafnisky’s 24-yard touchdown scamper. But Yale benefited from a Lehigh mistake — punter Austin Devine couldn’t handle a snap in his end zone and the ball dribbled out the back for a safety. \nLater in the third, Salter broke out for a 42-yard touchdown run to put the Mountain Hawks up 21-7. Then in the fourth, Lehigh’s Troy Pelletier fumbled a punt, giving Yale the ball at the Lehigh 7. Three plays later, Morgan Roberts hit Ross Drwal from 5 yards for a touchdown. \nShafnisky was 26 of 45 for 211 yards and carried 19 times for 78 yards.
