Ireland to make splash at Euro 2016 Source: AFP | October 10, 2015, Saturday | Print Edition \nNORTHERN Ireland manager Michael O’Neill pledged that his side would “make an impact” at the 2016 European Championship after securing a historic qualification for the tournament. \nCaptain Steven Davis scored twice as O’Neill’s men beat Greece 3-1 at Windsor Park in Belfast on Thursday to qualify for their first major championship since the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. \nIt will be the first time Northern Ireland has ever appeared at a European Championship, but O’Neill says it will not travel to France to make up the numbers. \n“We’re not just going to go to France and enjoy it,” said O’Neill, whose side has risen from 88th to 35th in the FIFA world ranking during his tenure. “We’re going to go and try to make an impact. I genuinely believe, fitness and availability willing, we can go there with a real optimism. \n“I’m very proud of what we’ve achieved. This is certainly the highest point of my career, either as a player or a manager.” \nO’Neill reserved special praise for Southampton midfielder Davis, who netted either side of a Josh Magennis header before Christos Aravidis claimed a late consolation for the Greeks. \n“Steven’s performance was out of this world. He is a magnificent captain,” said O’Neill, a former player with Newcastle United and Wigan Athletic, who succeeded Nigel Worthington as manager in December 2011. \nNorthern Ireland’s greatest player, George Best, made 37 appearances for his country between 1964 and 1977, scoring nine goals, but the Manchester United winger never played at a major tournament. \nThe ‘Green and White Army’ reached the quarterfinals at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, losing 0-4 to France, and made successive appearances at the tournament in 1982 and 1986. \nMore recently, a team spearheaded by record scorer David Healy enjoyed famous wins over England and Spain in qualifying for the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008, but failed to reach either tournament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:20.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
