FOOTBALL: North Quincy gets first win Aidan Brown rushed for 215 yards and three TDs Friday night as the Raiders beat Pembroke, 41-6, at home. Comment By David Konowitch The Patriot Ledger   10:50 pm Updated at 11:29 PM QUINCY – On Senior Night, it was North Quincy senior running back Aidan Brown who showed up to play for the Raiders. In a battle of teams each seeking their first win of the season on Friday, Brown rushed 23 times for 215 yards and three touchdowns to lead North Quincy to a 41-6 victory over Pembroke at Veterans Memorial Stadium. North Quincy (1-3, 1-1 Patriot League Fisher Division) dominated the first half, forcing three turnovers and hitting three big plays for scores to go into the half up 20-0. Both teams lost fumbles on their opening drive, but Brown was able to break a 50-yard run on the second play of North Quincy’s second drive to open the scoring at 7-0. Raiders quarterback Joe Fallon (4 of 4 passing, 123 yards, two TDs) took advantage of the Titans through the air, hitting Tom Whooley for 51-yard touchdown and Jake Grady for a 30-yard score to put North Quincy ahead 20-0. Fallon hit four different targets throughout the night to bring balance to the Raiders offense. Brown added two more scores in the second half, and junior Liam O’Connor (four carries, 79 yards, TD) tacked on a score late in the fourth to give the Raiders more than 300 yards on the ground. Pembroke (0-4, 0-2) was able to come alive offensively late in the fourth quarter to avoid the shutout. Senior Brendon Sheehan (9 carries, 52 yards) scored on a 33-yard run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:16:58.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
