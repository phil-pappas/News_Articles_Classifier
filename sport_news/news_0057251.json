Park officials at Great America and the Six Flags Great Adventure in New York/New Jersey agreed to a bet before the start of the Cubs vs. Mets series. If the Cubs win, Great Adventure will be renamed Six Flags Great Cubs for the duration of its Fright Fest celebration. Likewise, its record-breaking Kingda Ka roller coaster would be renamed Kindga Cubs. Fright Fest at both parks runs through Nov. 1. On the flip side, that's how long Cubs fans could have a visible reminder of a Met's victory. If the Cubs lose, the large Six Flags Great America sign on Grand Avenue will read \"Six Flags Great Mets.\" Inside the park, the Goliath roller coaster would be renamed \"GoMets.\" Cubs fans in St. Louis are already basking in the glory of the division series win. Six Flags St. Louis has renamed its American Thunder ride as Cubs Thunder. That bet followed a taunt on the entrance sign of Six Flags St. Louis that read: \"No worries. It's just the Cubs\" prior to the two teams matching up. With the win, Six Flags St. Louis also sent Six Flags Great America pork steaks with Maull's BBQ sauce and toaster ravioli.
