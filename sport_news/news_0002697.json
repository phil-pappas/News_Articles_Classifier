Steven Ruiz , USATODAY 6:42 a.m. EDT October 1, 2015 Sep 27, 2015; Charlotte, NC, USA; Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton (1) celebrates after a touchdown during the fourth quarter against the New Orleans Saints at Bank of America Stadium. Carolina defeated the Saints 27-22. Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Jeremy Brevard, Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports) \nLost in all the talk about what Ed Hochuli did or did not say to Cam Newton during the Carolina anthers' 27-22 win over the New Orleans Saints was how good the franchise quarterback has looked in leading his team to a 3-0 start. \nOne of the more scrutinized quarterbacks in the league, Newton has slowly developed into much more than just a mobile threat. His play from the pocket has steadily improved, as has his command of Carolina's offensive system, of which he is most certainly the driving force. \nThe biggest development we've seen over the last year is Newton's ever-growing confidence before the snap. Because of his physical talents, Newton typically has been written off as athletic freak who struggles with the mental aspects of the game. He's never going to get the credit, say, Andrew Luck gets for being a student of the game, even if he's earned it. \nHere's is just one of many examples of Newton's underrated football IQ at work. \nMore so than any other quarterback, Newton is his team's offense. He's carrying an underwhelming supporting cast to offensive competence - Carolina ranks 15th in points per game. \nHe threw for more than 300 yards and two touchdowns against New Orleans with a wide receiver corps of Ted Ginn, Corey Brown, Devin Funchess, and Brenton Bersin. \nThe 26-year-old signal-caller is playing in a less-than-ideal situation, but is it the worst in the league? \nWe tried to figure that out with a metric we'll call QB Situation Grade, which factors in the three elements most conducive to quarterback success: An offense that keeps him in favorable down-and-distances; a group of receivers who will make plays when given the opportunity; and a good offensive line. We created three statistical measures to capture those factors as best we could. \nThe first, called \" Favorable D+D ,\" is how often the QB throws on non-passing downs (second- and third-and-long) The second, called \" Plays made ,\" measures the number of accurate throws a QB makes that are caught by his receivers. And the third, \" Pass blocking ,\" is a measure of the offensive line's protection, using Pro Football Focus' Pass Blocking Efficiency metric. \" Situation Grade \" is an average of those three categories. \nEach figure has been adjusted to the league average, with 100 being the average for each category. Above 100 is good; below is bad. \nUnsurprisingly, the Panthers rank last in \"plays made,\" but it's actually Nick Foles who has been put in the worst situation so far in 2015, followed by Chicago and then Carolina. \nOakland finishing 2nd is a little surprising, but RB Latavius Murray has been good on first down, and the pass blocking in Oakland has been superb for two years running. It's not shocking in the least bit that the Cowboys finished atop the list with that offensive line and a solid group of receivers, even without Dez Bryant playing two games. \nWith that in mind, let's get to this week's rankings... \n(Note: Injured QBs will not be included in the rankings until they are back healthy, so no Ben Roethlisberger, Tony Romo or Drew Brees for now) \nLast Week vs. KC: 24-35, 333 yards, 5 touchdowns, 0 interceptions \nI could go on and on about how good Rodgers has been over the last year-plus, but I'll let his numbers do the talking: Aaron Rodgers stat line from last 18 games at home (excluding that Bears game)394 of 572 (68.9%), 5,212 yards (9.1 Y/A), 48 TDs, 0 INTs. â€” Football Perspective (@fbgchase) September 29, 2015 \nLast Week vs. JAX: 33-42, 358 yards, 2 touchdowns, 0 interceptions \nThe Patriots are looking very much like the 2007 outfit that finished the regular season 16-0. Brady can lean on a solid running game (the Pats rank fourth in Favorable D+D) and his receiving corps will only get better when Brandon LaFell returns from injury. The 38-year-old may not be a mobile threat, but he can certainly buy time with his legs when he needs to . \nLast Week vs. MIN: 21-34, 246 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception \nWith top-level guys dropping due to injuries, Old Man Rivers has managed to climb to the No. 3 spot despite playing in the 26th-ranked situation, according to our metrics. The Vikings pass rush abused the Chargers front, giving Rivers little time to work his pocket magic. His one interception bounced off Keenan Allen's hands right to Chad Greenway . \nLast Week vs. DAL: 24-36, 285 yards, 2 touchdowns, 0 interceptions \nWhat a difference a year makes. If we had done these situation rankings a year ago, Ryan's Falcons would undoubtedly finish near the bottom. In 2015, they're in the top 10 thanks to offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan's scheme , which Ryan is a perfect fit for. With the Atlanta running game finding early success, Ryan has been deadly on play-action, particularly to the league's best receiver, Julio Jones. And don't sleep on his ability to move . \nLast Week vs. SF: 20-32, 311 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception \nBruce Arians loves a pro-style quarterback, and Palmer might be the prototype. He's big, strong and unafraid to take chances downfield. His willingness to take chances may start to hurt catch up with him when the Cardinals start to play more opportunistic defenses; but, for now, Palmer is playing like a top quarterback. \nLast Week vs. DET: 31-42, 324 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception \nManning has no running game (Denver ranks 30th in Favorable D+D) and a green offensive line, but he and Kubiak have made their adjustments , and the 38-year-old has looked better every week. This may not be the record-breaking Manning we've grown accustomed to, but he's still a very good passer. \nLast Week vs. CHI: 20-30, 235, 1 touchdown, 0 interceptions \nWorking behind one of the league's worst pass-blocking lines has been difficult for Wilson in 2015, but the Seahawks haven't found themselves in a lot of second- and third-and-long situations and Seattle's receivers have made most of their opportunities. Against the Bears, Wilson wasn't asked to do too much with the Seahawks defense and special teams turning in spectacular performances. But when Seattle needed a play, he came through more often than not. \nLast Week vs. NO: 20-31, 315 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception \nNewton finally cracks the top 10 after a do-it-all performance against the Saints. The Panthers dropped only one pass on Sunday, which explains the uptick in Newton's statistical performance. \nLast Week vs. WSH: 23-32, 279 yards, 2 touchdowns, 0 interceptions \nManning is another passer who is carrying a big load in 2015. The Giants running game has been hit or miss, and Preston Parker single-handedly offset Odell Beckham Jr.'s awesomeness before being cut. Despite all that, Eli is on pace for a career-high passer rating and has yet to throw an interception. \nLast Week: vs. TEN, 18-30, 260 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions \nThere was just something off about Luck's performance in Tennessee in Week 3, and it makes a lot more sense with the Colts announcing he's dealing with a shoulder issue . Until his shoulder heals (and he stops turning over the ball so much) we'll keep him in the bottom of the top 10. \n11. Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens; 12. Ryan Tannehill, Miami Dolphins; 13. Andy Dalton, Cincinnati Bengals \nFlacco is still the same guy he's been for the last three years, but with so many quarterbacks going down, he moves up by default. \nTannehill had a rough game against the Buffalo Bills, but his offensive line did not do him any favors. He was pressured on nearly 50% of his dropbacks on Sunday, and two of his three interceptions were hardly on him. It is, however, concerning that we haven't seen much growth from Tannehill this year. \nDalton, meanwhile, has shown some growth in the pocket. He looks more comfortable with bodies around him, but, at the same time, he hasn't faced much adversity in the Bengals' three games this season. The jury is still out on Cincinnati's franchise quarterback. \nCarr very nearly cracked the \"On the Cusp\" group after an impressive display in Cleveland. He's drawn some comparisons to Aaron Rodgers from some of No. 12's former teammates . And you can certainly see some similarities. Carr is smooth in the pocket and gets rid of the ball quickly - which is part of the reason the Raiders don't give up many sacks - but, unlike Rodgers, he has to get a better sense of timing when throw the ball deep. He certainly has the arm strength to throw it long, but he'll make throws after the receiver has made his break . We'd also like to see him stop throwing the ball flat-footed , a big problem he had in his rookie season . \nA week after we celebrated his improvements, Colin Kaepernick repaid us with a stinker. He reverted back to all of his bad tendencies: backfoot throws, impatient play in the pocket and not going through his reads before starting to scramble. Let's hope this is an expectation and not the rule, because Kaepernick is fun to watch when he's on. \nMariota turned in his best performance of the season against the Colts. He looked more comfortable in the pocket, and we even saw him get to his second and third reads on multiple plays. This is easily the best throw he's made all season: \nWinston only led the Buccaneers to nine points against the Texans, but he played a solid game. His interception was another welcome-to-the-NFL moment . He tried to anticipate an opening in the defense, but Quintin Demps had no trouble breaking on the ball - NFL defensive backs are too good to make these throws. Winston made a number of impressive touch throws , so it wasn't all bad. Best throw of the week \nWe haven't given Tyrod Taylor enough love here, so let's take some time to admire this nice deep ball with pressure bearing down on him. The most impressive aspect of Taylor's start to the season is how well he's dealt with pressure . Worst throw of the week \nCarson Palmer made a nice run at this , but Colin Kaepernick was always going to be the choice. He gave us a lot to work with, but we'll go with his second pick -- a late backfoot throw right to Tyrann Mathieu for a pick-six. 25 CONNECT 77 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:45:00.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
