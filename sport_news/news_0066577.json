He will need more luck than that if he is to clinch his seventh MotoGP title - and 10th in all - in Sepang. \nRossi will take the title if he wins the race and Lorenzo finishes no higher than fifth. Should Rossi be second, he needs Lorenzo to be outside the top 10, while if Rossi is third, Lorenzo must be no higher than 15th.
