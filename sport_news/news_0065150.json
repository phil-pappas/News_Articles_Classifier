Fort spikers advance Jacob Onak | Union sports writer Daily Jefferson County Union \nThe Fort Atkinson High School girls’ volleyball team had to fight off some late momentum from Kenosha Bradford in order to keep its season alive. \nThe Blackhawks did just that, winning 3-0 and taking a couple close sets during their WIAA Division 1 Regional match ­at PremierBank Gymnasium on Thursday.. \n“We’re switching around some of our middle and outside hitting, just trying some different offensive options. Just kind of preparing for anything in a game,” said Fort head coach Liz Colver. “We still are coming back off some injuries here and there and just trying to stay prepared so we can put our best team on the court come Saturday.” \nA slower start to the first set was quickly erased by Fort, moving a 2-4 score to 8-6 by taking advantage of some Bradford miscues. The Blackhawks never looked back and took that lead all the way to a 25-15 first set win. \nThe start of the second set was as close as it can get, as the two teams traded points with Fort still holding a one point lead until Bradford briefly took charge at 10-9. \nHowever, senior Julia Hanson had a couple kills to help Fort get out and create some space between from Bradford. Fort got out to a 14-11 lead and a couple blocks from Miah Garant helped make it 16-12. Eventually the Blackhawks won 25-17. \nHanson led Fort with 18 kills and 23 digs while Garant had a team high four blocks and four aces. \nThe third set, Bradford was clearly playing for its season, making some strong defensive plays, and stifling the Fort attack. Kenosha did its best, forcing some long rallies until Garant continued her blocking at the net and Hanson hit some kills to help earn a 25-19 third set win. \n“I preach to them that you can never underestimate the power of a little momentum and I think that Bradford did a great job, I commend them on that,” Colver said. “They were getting some great ups and it’s just one of those things, we have to terminate the ball when we have the opportunity.” \nSarah Pfeifer had 15 assists in the match, while Grace Mans added 14 of her own to help out the Fort offense. \nWith the win, the Blackhawks will face off against Badger South Conference champ Milton on Saturday. Colver hopes that Fort can take some momentum and confidence into Milton, despite having a five set regular season loss to the Red Hawks. \n“I think it’s always tough, especially in post-season, playing any team in your conference,” Colver said. “Milton’s a good team, they took our conference this year and I think we are eager getting to play them in their gym, a little change of pace on that. (We have to) just play confident.” \nSaturday’s game is at 7 p.m. at Milton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:27:53.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
