Looking back I remember all the hotel stays, plane trips, tough practices and other things we went through. That’s what it’s all about — the ups and downs we experience that creates an indescribable bond.\nQ: On a scale of 1 to 10, what was your personal confidence level that you guys would beat Wisconsin in the Big Ten game with a first-time starting quarterback? \nA: 10. We have a next-man-up mentality and Cardale (Jones) was surrounded by great players. I believed in him and the players around him.\nQ: Same question — 1 to 10 on the confidence scale — about beating big, bad ’Bama? \nA: 10. The way we played in the Big Ten championship I felt like we would beat anyone. We were on a mission.\nQ: Now that you’re a senior, have you reflected on your time here? Has it been gratifying? \nA: Yeah, it’s been different going through my senior year. Everything is always “my last” — team run, opening game, etc. I look back on all the great things I’ve experienced here. I’ve learned so much and met great people. I feel prepared for the next chapter of my life.\nQ: You came to OSU with your friend Armani Reeves, who has since given up football because of concussions. How is Armani doing? \nA: Armani is doing well! He has found his niche in coaching. He’s doing a great job for us and helping with the defensive backs. He seems to really enjoy it. He’s also beginning to train for American Ninja Warrior, which seems to be his next physical challenge!\nQ: When you see something like that happen to someone so close to you, does it give you pause about the sport? \nA: It definitely makes you pause. You don’t want to take anything for granted. Doing what you love — football for us — is a blessing. And it can be taken away any day or second.\nQ: I read that your father (Brent) helped Armani reach this decision; with him being a former NFL player, have you guys had conversations about safety? \nA: We have. It is less concerning these days because people are more cautious of concussions and head trauma. So my dad is less concerned with the awareness, but it is always important to be smart and communicate if something’s wrong. Football is a sport that we love but it doesn’t last forever. Both of my parents always expressed that there are other things more important in life than football.\nQ: You’re fairly obvious out there on the field as the up back on the punt team; what is your role? \nA: I’m the middle shield of the punt team, and it is a pretty significant role. It’s something I take really seriously as way to help the team. Coach Meyer is the punt team coach and he only puts someone in there that he trusts. It truly is an honor to fill this role.\nQ: Are you sort of a traffic cop, in terms of making sure everyone is lined up properly for their blocks? \nA: That is mostly what I do. I get us in the right formation and scheme so the opponent won’t block the punt. If you get a punt blocked you lose the game 90 percent of time. The punt is something Coach Meyer and the team take very seriously!\nQ: It’s been a while since OSU has had a punt blocked. When it does happen, do your coaches get angry? \nA: The last time we got a punt blocked was in 2012, my freshman year. Coach Meyer went crazy!\nQ: As the quarterback of the punt team, does that mean you can audible to a fake where you get to run the ball? \nA: I could audible a fake! That’s why Coach Meyer puts someone in there that he trusts, because I’m too scared if we didn’t get the first down! We have run a few fakes since I’ve been on punt and it’s always fun.\nQ: You will graduate in December; what do you plan to do with your degree? \nA: I have been all over the place on my career after football. I’ve talked about sports broadcasting, law school to become a sports attorney, and a few other ideas. During my time at OSU, I’ve learned that I have a passion for football. And I want to be heavily involved in that, not just around it. I want to be an NFL scout, in hopes that one day I can be a general manager for an NFL team. That is my dream.\nQ: You are a major-college football player and a scholar-athlete. Has it been difficult to balance athletics, academics and still maintain a social life? \nA: It has been tough. But you learn how to manage your time well. This rigorous schedule has been a great lifestyle in preparation for the real world. Long hours and days won’t bother me because that’s what I do now!\nQ: Your Twitter account shows some deep thoughts, my favorite being: “Darkness cannot drive out darkness. Only light can do that.” Do you enjoy bringing that thinking-man’s perspective? \nA: Absolutely. On the football team we get a ton of “nuggets,” as we call them — thoughts and messages that can be life-changing. I’ve journaled tons of messages because I want to have them forever. During my time at OSU I’ve become a really deep thinker. We are always growing and always learning. It’s always great to hear messages that help make us better.\nQ: Do your teammates appreciate that side of you? \nA: They do, and we feed off each other. We talk deep with each other frequently. We push each other to be better. They are great relationships.\nQ: Let’s talk New England. Rank them in order: Bruins, Celtics, Patriots, Red Sox. \nA: PATRIOTS, PATRIOTS, PATRIOTS and, oh yeah, the Pats! I don’t care about any other sports team in Boston!\nQ: What is your stance on the whole Deflategate scandal? \nA: Tom Brady is the best ever! That’s my comment!\nQ: Would you agree that Bill Belichick is the NFL’s Darth Vader and Brady is his little spawn? \nA: Yes. Bill has proven that he is arguably the best ever, both as a head coach and general manager. I would love to work with him someday! And as long as Tom is playing, the Patriots will always be successful.\nrstein@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:54:39.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
