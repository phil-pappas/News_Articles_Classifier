He has been limited to shooting and individual drills. The Cavs open Tuesday night in Chicago, and James says he'll play if \"everything goes right.\"\nThe four-time MVP said Friday he is listening to the team's medical staff and \"not be hardheaded.\" James received a similar anti-inflammatory shot early last season.\nGeneral manager David Griffin expects James to play in the opener, but \"if something happens and he doesn't, it's not going to be the end of the world.\"\nJames is entering his 13th NBA season and has logged nearly 44,000 minutes in the regular season during his career.\n All rights reserved.
