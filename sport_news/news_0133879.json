The decision to add sergeants to the list of officers wearing them is the second major revision since the department's draft policy was released in September.\nThree weeks ago, White pledged his commitment to require officers working off-duty security assignments to wear body cameras, another change that had been recommended by Independent Monitor Nick Mitchell.\nThe mayor and City Council, along with multiple civic organizations, agreed with Mitchell's recommendations.\nWhite told the safety committee, \"I'm now of the opinion that sergeants should have body cameras.\" He did not elaborate on why he changed his mind.\nAdvertisement Adding more cameras to the department will be expensive, and commanders are still trying to develop a policy that off-duty police would have to follow. In off-duty assignments, officers are hired to work private security details, but they wear their uniforms, use department equipment and are bound by department rules. Off-duty details include everything from Red Rocks concerts to LoDo bars to weddings in public parks.\nThe city signed a contract in July for $6.1 million with Taser International to provide 800 body cameras and store data for five years.\nThe first 200 body cameras will be fielded in November to officers in District 6 and the traffic and gang units. Cameras will be rolled out in the remaining five districts throughout 2016, White said.\nSWAT officers will not wear the cameras because the footage could compromise tactics, White said.\nIn 2014, the department ran a body camera pilot program for patrol officers in District 6, which includes downtown Denver. Afterward, Mitchell and his staff evaluated the pilot project and concluded that about one in every four use-of-force incidents involving District 6 officers was recorded during the six-month trial run.\nThe report angered police commanders, but they have warmed to Mitchell's recommendations in the past few months.\n\"Sergeants are essential to the DPD's patrol operations, and I am pleased that the department is giving them this tool to enhance accountability and community/officer safety,\" Mitchell said Tuesday in a statement.\nThe department's body camera policy remains a work-in-progress, especially the piece that would govern the off-duty usage. The City Council would have to fund the additional cameras and data storage, which could cost hundreds of thousands more. There are officers, including 202 detectives, who would not wear the cameras as part of their regular police duties but would need them to work the special security details.\nA camera costs $660 and data storage is $192 annually, according to White's presentation.\nThe council's public safety committee appeared receptive to the changes. They did not vote on changes or increasing the budget.\nOne of the challenges is figuring out how off-duty officers would upload the footage from their cameras when finishing work. If they drive back to their district offices, they would have to be paid by the city, White said. It also would be inconvenient.\nWhite is considering buying docking stations for each officer's house. That would cost an estimated $250,000, White said. But that plan opens questions about evidence security in legal cases.\nThe camera footage also will generate more work for detectives, internal affairs investigators, prosecutors and defense attorneys who will want to review it.\nThe department also is considering charging those who hire off-duty officers a fee to help pay for cameras and docking stations, White said.\nOnce District 6's patrol officers start wearing the cameras, they will be involved in developing the policy for off-duty usage, White said.\n\"There are some challenging questions, but I think we can get our arms around them,\" White said.\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or @Noelle_Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:03:28.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
