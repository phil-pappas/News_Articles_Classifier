Spartans close league schedule against winless Vikings By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nThe Emporia High football team’s word of the week — discipline — will play a large part in whether the Spartans return from Friday’s road game against Seaman with a win. \n“You got to be assignment sound,” EHS running back/linebacker JeMarcus Morehead said. “Everybody just needs to do their job and we should be fine.” \nThe Spartans (2-3) have been disciplined each week in preparing for every opponent the same, regardless of record or ranking. That focus should be tested especially this week against a winless Seaman team, which has lost five games to teams with a combined record of 22-3. \n“Our kids don’t care,” EHS head coach Corby Milleson said of opposing teams’ records. “I make more of the schedule than they do. They’ve done a great job all season long of buying into what we do, and they say the next game is the most important game because it’s the next game and then we move on to the next one. \n“They’re not practicing any different for Seaman than they did for Topeka High. People don’t believe me, but it’s true.” \nThe Spartans enter Friday on a strong three-game stretch that includes blowout wins against Topeka West (72-14) and Shawnee Heights (42-14), with a close loss to ranked Topeka High in between. \n“I think we’re pretty up there,” Morehead said of the team’s confidence. “We still haven’t hit our peak yet, but we’re pretty confident in ourselves. I know the running backs are confident in the line and the line’s confident in the running backs.” \nIn the last three games, Emporia’s offense has put up just under 45 points per game, a significant increase from the Spartans’ 14 total points in the first two weeks of the season. \n“We get pretty hyped, as you can see sometimes,” Morehead said of when the offense is clicking. “We get on each other a lot, but we know we’re brothers so we pick each other up again.” \nMorehead, whose 122 yards receiving rank second for the Spartans, brings a dual-threat on offense as well as a versatile presence to their defense. He also brings the type of effort Milleson loves to coach. \n“JeMarcus, just his confidence is a big thing,” Milleson said. “This year he’s been really, really good on offense and defense. If he’s getting the ball, he’s good. If he’s not getting the ball, he’s good. He’s a nice kid to coach.” \nJunior quarterback Dalton Cowan, who’s thrown for 535 yards this season, leads Seaman’s offense. Senior running back Colton Moranz adds another threat for the Spartans to contain, as he’s accumulated 356 rushing yards this year on more than four yards a carry. \n“(Cowan’s) got a great arm. That in itself is a great challenge,” Milleson said. “Offensively, Moranz can run and if he gets loose we’re going to have a hard time catching him. So those two challenges for us defensively are massive.” \nDefensively, Milleson said a few talented linemen anchor the Vikings, which will be a key battle in the Spartans’ final Centennial League matchup before district play next week. \nUltimately, Emporia’s ability to get back to .500 hinges on nothing different than any other game. \n“It’s a little bit of what all games come down to: who controls the ball, who controls the clock and who makes less mistakes,” Milleson said. “That’s our game plan going in anyway, to keep their offense off the field and be assignment sound.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:52:51.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
