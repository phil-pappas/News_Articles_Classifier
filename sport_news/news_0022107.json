The Touche boys, 16, are now all-state juniors at Albuquerque Academy. Charles plays defense, while Alex — the older twin by a minute — is a midfielder.\nThe Chargers, who improved to New Mexico-best 14-1-1 on Tuesday with a district win over Moriarty, are after their first state championship since 2001.\nAcademy has been in the finals six times since 2004, including each of the last two years, without winning a blue trophy. Academy has won 11 games in a row this season, and surrendered just eight goals. La Cueva, at the metro championships, was the only team to solve the Chargers.\n“I think this year, all the expectations will be on us,” said Alex. “But we’re more equipped to handle that pressure this year.”\nThe Touche matriarch, Alicia, is herself an Academy alum, which is how the family came to move from England to New Mexico.\nTheir parents met at the Cannes Film Festival in France, as both worked in the movie industry. She once worked for Disney, while Peter, their father, worked at Ingenious Media.\nAlicia hankered to move back to the States, closer to home, and now her boys are following in her Academy footsteps.\n“We came back quite a bit (to Albuquerque) for holidays,” Charles said. “It wasn’t much of a surprise. It wasn’t as difficult as adjusting as one might think. It’s more spacious here, more relaxed.”\nWhether the same could be said for soccer is more difficult to ascertain.\nThey didn’t play the equivalent of club soccer in England; rather, they simply played for their school.\nBut soccer was their passion.\n“In the countryside on the weekend, the two of us would play in the backyard for six hours a day,” Alex said.\nWhen they moved here, they immediately played up a year.\n“That was good for us,” Alex said. “All the players here were at a really good level.”\nAsked what the level of soccer athlete was here compared to England, Charles said, “It wasn’t much lower.”\n“Athletically,” Alex chimed in, “players were probably better here. But they hadn’t grown up with a soccer ball, like people in England had.”\nThe brothers admit they call it football when they’re in England, but have become accustomed to referring to the sport as soccer. They rooted for the U.S. women at the World Cup, but not the men. Their hearts still belong to the English national team.\nBut Charles said it is obvious that the sport is growing in popularity in America.\n“Definitely,” he said. “And it’s good for the development of the country’s soccer.”\nAdded Alex: “For U.S. soccer, the past few years the landscape has shifted. Now they realize they’ve gotten so much higher.”\nAlex said a country’s performance in a World Cup should be the barometer for how it is judged by other nations.\n“But,” he said, “they base it on the raw talent they have at a young age.”\nAnd the Academy, the brothers say, has been beneficial to their development.\n“I think it’s really been very good for us as players,” Charles said. “To fit in at this level, this technical level, is very demanding.”\nBut will it all end happily next month at state? After two straight losses in the finals, there might be room for doubt.\n“Anything other than a win this year would really feel disappointing,” Charles said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:25:27.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
