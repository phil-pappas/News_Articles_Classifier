Senior quarterback Ben Clark tossed three touchdowns passes -- each within a span of 4 minutes and 30 seconds of game clock -- to ignite Horseheads in a 37-6 rout of Ithaca. Although the Blue Raiders had two drive starts begin deep in Ithaca territory during the first quarter, Horseheads had only a 25-yard field goal from Taner Melez and a 3-0 lead to show for it. In the second quarter, after Horseheads stymied an Ithaca drive on downs at the Blue Raider 28 yard line, the team’s no-huddle spread offense finally got into a rhythm. A 10-play, 72-yard scoring drive that followed was capped when Ben Clark hooked up with Andrew Clark on a 30-yard touchdown strike that converted a fourth-and-10 play. Melez’s extra point gave the Blue Raiders a 10-0 lead with exactly 6:00 left before halftime. On just the second play of Horseheads’ next possession, Noah Bosket caught a screen pass from Ben Clark and motored 90 yards to the end zone to up the lead to 17-0 with 2:56 left in the second quarter. The Blue Raiders made it 24-0 when Ben Clark connected with Garrette Briggs for a 25-yard touchdown pass with just 1:30 left before halftime. The TD toss came one play after Ithaca punted the ball away. Horseheads’ Casey Miller and Clai Wood each scored on one-yard touchdown runs in the third quarter. Miller’s score capped a 15-play, 63-yard drive on the opening possession of the second half. Wood scored after Ithaca averted the shutout to get on the scoreboard. Horseheads (3-2, 1-1) snapped a two-game losing streak with the win and will play at Johnson City at 7 p.m. Friday.
