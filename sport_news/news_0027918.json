His execution, now set for Jan. 12, 2017, had previously been scheduled to take Jan. 21 of next year .\nMany of the 24 other inmates on death row also had their execution dates postponed, some by more than three years.\nThe Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said in a statement that its need to extra time to procure supplies of sodium thiopental and pentobarbital, Ohio's execution drugs of choice, from overseas or from small-scale drug manufacturers called compounding pharmacies.\nState officials obtained an import license from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to buy execution drugs from overseas. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration subsequently warned Ohio that attempts to import such drugs from overseas would violate federal law.\nOhio lawmakers passed an execution secrecy law last year designed to encourage compounding pharmacies to make lethal-injection drugs. But the American Pharmacists Association , as well as many compounding pharmacists in Ohio , have voiced reluctance to make and sell such drugs.\nExecutions have been on hold in Ohio since January 2014, when murderer Dennis McGuire took an unexpectedly long 25 minutes to die from a previously untried two-drug cocktail of midazolam and hydromorphone.\nState officials defended McGuire's death but switched to sodium thiopental and pentobarbital – both of which have previously used in Ohio executions – in hopes they could find a new source of the drugs.\nRevised Ohio execution dates\nName Old Execution Date New Execution Date Ronald Phillips Jan. 21, 2016 Jan. 12, 2017 Raymond Tibbetts Feb. 19, 2016 Feb. 15, 2017 Gary Otte March 15, 2017 Same Jeremiah Jackson March 22, 2017 Same Alva Campbell, Jr. March 23, 2016 May 10, 2017 Donald Ketterer May 17, 2017 Same William Montgomery Aug. 15, 2016 June 13, 2017 Mark Pickens July 19, 2017 Same Robert Van Hook Oct. 19, 2016 July 26, 2017 Jeffrey A.
