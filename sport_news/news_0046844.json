Taylor Gonzales looms large in rain, Warwick's 1-0 victory over Manheim Township DAN MARSCHKA | Staff Photographer \nSoccer balls at LMHS practice. \nIn her two-and-a-half seasons as Warwick's starting keeper Taylor Gonzales has been called on to make, and has made, many a save. \nTuesday night, in a driving rain at Grosh Field, she saved the Warriors' 1-0 victory over the visiting L-L Section One leading Blue Streaks, and turned the section race on its ear with 12 saves. \nTwenty minutes after freshman Emma Oberholtzer's first career goal gave Gonzales a lead to protect, with four minutes left in the game, Gonzales began a last stand that saw her make her final three saves in a frenetic flurry in the last 90 seconds. \n“It was chaotic,” she said, “ but awesome!” \nAwesome was her denial of the Streaks, who suffered their first loss of the season, falling to 5-1-1 in the league, 9-1-1 overall. \nArising from a half-long slumber with 11 minutes to play, the Streaks picked up where they'd left off at intermission, bringing pressure in the offensive third. \nAfter six scoring opportunities fizzled in front of her, things got hot for Gonzales when she stopped Madi Kohl with 4:06 left. \nKohl was far from through as she rifled a shot at Gonzalez from point blank range with 1:30 left. \nThe shot bounced off Gonzales' chest back to Kohl, who unleashed another blast. \nAgain Gonzales made herself big, and the rebound came to Aubrey Suydam, a “managable” six feet away. Gonzales covered it and the crucible passed. \n“You definitely have to come out and be bold,” she said. “Go for it.” \nTownship owned the first half with 11 scoring opportunities, leading to nine shots on goal. Gonzales stopped seven — the other two on frame but not dangerous. \nThe Warriors (3-4, 5-5) tilted the field in their favor after halftime, taking over long portions of the game. \n“We definitely stopped their momentum,” said Gonzales. “We calmed down, tried to focus more and we achieved that.” \nJust after Sam Machin chipped over the crossbar, off Kate Martin's corner service, the ball came out to the midfield, where it was directed to Sam Springer. \nShe chipped the ball ahead to Oberholtzer, running into the box. \n“I touched it forward with my knee and saw an open corner,” Oberholtzer said. “I went to take a shot, off my shinguard, and it went right by the goalie.” \nWith its 4-0 victory over Penn Manor, and the Township loss, Conestoga Valley (6-1, 8-2) takes over sole possession of first place in the section. \nFalling to Cedar Crest 1-0, Hempfield (4-2-1, 6-2-2) drops into third place, just a point ahead of the Falcons (4-3, 6-4-1).
