Seasons remain open on Great Lakes feeders for lake trout on Lake Erie, its tributaries and the upper Niagara River. Anglers can keep one laker measuring 12 inches or more. The lake trout season closed on other Great Lakes Sept. 30.\nLaunching options\nBuffalo Harbor State Park launching procedures will be about the same as when the site was the Small Boat Harbor. Slip holders must have their vessels out of the water by Thursday and work crews will be removing dockage thereafter. Officials noted that anglers will be able to use the launch ramps during and after dock removal work and access will be allowed until weather condition block access as in the past.\nAt Sturgeon Point, starting Thursday park facilities will be closed (gas dock, lavatories, bait dispensers), but the ramps will be open until weather bars access.\nDocks at all launch ramps in lower Cattaraugus Creek remain in place (Town of Hanover, Hidden Harbor and the state launch). Rick Miller at Miller’s Bait & Tackle in Irving notes the state launch has yet to pull the floating docks and most sites keep at least one side dock in place until about Nov. 1.\nDocks remain in place at Dunkirk Harbor, Barcelona Harbor and all access ramps along Lake Ontario from Fort Niagara to Oak Orchard Point.\nLake Erie\n“We need more water,” is a Quote: from feeder-stream anglers and bait dealers along the Erie and Ontario shore. The last round of drenching rain left a brief staining in the Cattaraugus Creek and not enough water feeding into Erie’s smaller streams to draw good runs of trout.\nRainbow/steelies have moved up the Catt from the mouth all the way past Gowanda. Miller says most casters up stream go with egg sacs or flies while shore casters near the mouth or on the breakwater go with spinners and spoons.\nEven better news is that when the bite is on, the action can be all hours of the day and from all appearances the dredging operations have stopped for the season.\nOn most other Erie feeders, the best trout option has been casting into open waters near creek mouths.\nPerch fishing is the biggest gambling casino in Western New York. Before the latest wind whacking a sizable school of perch began showing west of Sturgeon Point at depths of 52 to 55 feet. An odd catch of good numbers and impressive sizes showed at Cattaraugus Creek, but the bite site did not produce the next day and boaters might see active schools at 40-foot depths at the same time that 72-foot depths west of the Catt were promising if not productive. Perchers might try dice-shaped sinkers. It’s a gamble out there.\nNiagara River\nCasino-like conditions prevail in the lower river. The king salmon run has neared if not hit its peak and some boaters are getting bigger fish. On average, catch numbers are down, but many successful outings include kings at and over the 40 inches.\nCapt. Randy Lingenfelter, with First Choice Fishing Charters, had a client hook into a 27-pound king salmon caught on Pro Cure Wizard. Lingenfelter notes that each day out is a different catch count but better sizes.\nMost of the salmon bite has been on either cured skein or salmon eggs. The shore bite is in line with the boaters’ catches – few but bigger kings so far this season.\nLake Ontario\nShore anglers may have to do a rain dance to see the best conditions for a trout and salmon run, according to Wes Walker at Slipper Sinker Bait & Tackle in Olcott.\nWalker has had good reports of browns and steelies moving into Wilson Harbor, Olcott Harbor and Oak Orchard Creek, with a nice mix of panfish, both perch and bluegills/sunfish showing as well.\nDock casters have done best at Wilson, Olcott and Oak Orchard casting to the deeper waters. The bite can be good upstream. Lower current levels have drawn trout and salmon, but have yet to move into extremely shallow stream waters.\nCasting spoons sent in the right direction from docks, piers and breakwaters near feeder mouths have been the most effective approach. A silver spoon body is basic. Overspray colors vary between green, red or orange. Being there at the right time has been more important than lure-body color. Mornings have been slightly better than evenings of late.\nemail: odrswill@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:31:08.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
