To score goals, we have to attack.\" \nWenger acknowledged a repeat of the start against United would be \"ideal\", but conceded: \"That is difficult to plan - we did not plan to be 3-0 up after 20 minutes\". \nThe Gunners boss accepts no matter what the challenge in front of them, his players must just focus on delivering another high-calibre performance of their own. \n\"What we want to do is play up to our level, because that will be needed because we play against a big team,\" he said. \n\"We feel a bit that the pain inflicted (following disappointing European results) was a bit by ourselves, maybe subconsciously we thought, 'Anyway we will win these'. Now to correct that we need a great performance.\" \nStriker Giroud, who came off the bench to net with almost his first touch against Watford, will be available for selection having served a one-match Champions League suspension following his red card away to Dinamo Zagreb. \nWenger must also decide whether to give veteran keeper Petr Cech his first European start or keep faith with David Ospina, whose handling mistake led to one of the goals in Arsenal's disappointing 3-2 home defeat by Olympiacos.
