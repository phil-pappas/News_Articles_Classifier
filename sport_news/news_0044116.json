We had a lot of opportunities but sometimes you have days like these where you don’t take them,” Georgia captain Gorgodze told reporters.\nAll Namibia’s points came from flyhalf Theuns Kotze with a dramatic late try, three penalties and a difficult conversion of his own try to set up a grandstand finish.\nThe African side had hung in through the first half despite being overwhelmed by Georgia and through much of the second period, even when down to 13 men. It also lost inspirational captain Jacques Burger to a head injury after 10 minutes and picked up three sin-binnings.\nNamibia finally had its defenses breached after 50 minutes when Gorgodze crashed over for Georgia’s first points after being repeatedly thwarted in a frustrating first half.\nFive minutes later Georgia scored its second try as Giorgi Tkhilaishvili peeled off the line out to feed the ball for stand-off Malaguradze to run in from close range.\nSeeking to put more distance between itself and Namibia, Georgia extended its lead to 17-9 with Kvirikashvili’s penalty.\nBut a last burst of energy from the plucky Namibians sent Kotze over in the corner. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:25:24.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
