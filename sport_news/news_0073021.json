Kela, a rookie, dealt with elbow inflammation in the final month of the season and will probably have a light offseason. Tolleson threw in five straight games in the final week of the regular season, and it was clear his arm was impacted. Dyson, a former starter, surpassed his previous professional high by 31 appearances.\nIt was amazing work. But given the nature and the stress of the job, the Rangers can't expect the quartet to be as resilient in 2016. It simply means the Rangers can't afford to overlook the bullpen in putting together the roster.\nLuke Jackson gives the Rangers one enticing option as an insurance policy. Though Tanner Scheppers had a miserable season, the Rangers will have to think long and hard about whether to non-tender him in salary arbitration. Two years out from the failed experiment as a starter, he might be back to where he once was. And there will be a handful of attractive veterans on the free-agent market.\nOn Twitter:\n @Evan_P_Grant", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Evan_P_Grant"], "published": "2015-10-22T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:39:46.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
