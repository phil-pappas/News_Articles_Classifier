A commission team was also due in Turkey later Monday to assess co-operation on the ground.\nIn France on Sunday, Erdogan accused European nations of “confining refugees into the depth of the Mediterranean” in a reference to refugees who drown trying to reach Europe.\nHe was speaking at a rally in Strasbourg attended by hundreds of Turks, before Turkey’s Nov. 1 elections. The speech was televised live in Turkey.\nCritics accuse Erdogan of organizing rallies in Turkey and Europe to drum up votes for the ruling Justice and Development Party, in breach of laws that require him to be neutral.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:28:21.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
