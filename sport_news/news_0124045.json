Filed: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 22:50 UK Last Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 22:50 UK \nLeeds United have dropped plans to stage a protest against fixture changes that would have seen the club take up no more than their minimum allocation of 2,000 tickets per away game. \nSo far this season, 13 of the Yorkshire club's matches have been altered from their original start time, 10 for television coverage on Sky Sports. \nOn October 16, Leeds owner Massimo Cellino issued a press release highlighting his intention to take up the reduced amount of away tickets \"to make the Football League take notice\" of their \"right to play [at Elland Road] in front of our fans at the traditional time\". \nOn Tuesday, however, the club released a joint statement alongside Leeds Fans Utd which read: \"We will be working together to come up with a mutually beneficial solution that ensures supporters are no longer being unfairly penalised by fixture changes. \n\"Following discussions today between the two parties it has been agreed that the 2,000 tickets restriction for away supporters will be lifted with immediate effect. The club maintains its position that it can determine the number of tickets that can be sold to its supporters for away games.\" \nLast season Leeds averaged a league-high away attendance of 2,774 per game.   match previews newsletter!
