They were heavy favorites against Oregon State, expected to finish as the Pac-12’s worst team, and won accordingly.\nSo where does that leave Arizona?\nThe next few weeks will go a long way toward figuring out where exactly the Wildcats (4-2 overall, 1-2 Pac-12) stand in the Pac-12’s pecking order. The most critical stretch of Arizona’s season begins Saturday, when the Wildcats take on Colorado in another game that they’re expected to win.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats XTRA app: Get latest news, scores\nFor the first time in weeks, the team feels good.\nLast week’s rout of the Beavers has given the Wildcats a pep in their step, a confidence and happiness that had briefly disappeared.\n“You get a little bounce in your step and more than anything you get your confidence back,” coach Rich Rodriguez said. “You have another bad outing, you lose that.”\nColorado (3-3, 0-2) is currently on a two-game losing streak, but that doesn’t tell the whole story.\nThe Buffaloes played Oregon even through the first half of their Oct. 3 game, and were within a touchdown as late as the fourth quarter. Some late-game mistakes ultimately led to a 41-24 loss.\nAZCENTRAL\nUA football turning to backup RBs\nThat’s a far cry from the Colorado team that came to Tucson in 2012 and watched as UA’s Ka’Deem Carey ran for 366 yards and five touchdowns on the way to a 56-31 Wildcats win.\nIn 2013, Arizona led 24-13 at halftime before pulling away 44-20.\nArizona led last year’s game 21-17 at halftime, and 24-20 after three quarters before pulling away with a 38-20 victory.\nColorado’s “way better” this season, safety Will Parks said.\n“I’ve been telling a lot of people that,” he said. “This isn’t Colorado; this is a new team.”\nAdded Reggie Gilbert: “They’re a good team. They’re going to fight you until the end, and they’re definitely one of the teams that you can’t sleep on. It’s going to be a good game.”\nThere are eight Wildcats left who played in the 2012 blowout at Arizona Stadium, including Parks and Gilbert. Another is Jared Baker, a backup running back who might start against the Buffs in place of the injured Nick Wilson.\nAZCENTRAL\nLinebacker Jake Matthews is next man up for UA football\nColorado’s best offensive player was on the field that day, too. Wide receiver Nelson Spruce started as a true freshman, and led the Buffs with 36 receiving yards. Now, he’s a star for Colorado, an All-Pac-12 selection last year and the school’s all-time leading receiver.\nSefo Liufau, a 6-foot-5, 240-pound junior, might be Saturday’s ‘X’ factor. Though he struggled in his previous two games against UA, Liufau has the size and skills to torment the Wildcats on Saturday.\n“He’s confident, and he can make all the throws,” Rodriguez said. “He reminds you of (former Oregon star Marcus) Mariota in that he’s hard to bring down.”\nPlus, Colorado’s rushing attack is top-notch, fifth in the conference in yards and third in touchdowns.\nThis, clearly, is not the Colorado of recent years.\n“They’ve improved every since I’ve been here,” UA safety Jamar Allah said. “They're definitely not what other people think they are; they’re a very good football team.”\nThere are no “cupcake” games in Pac-12 play anymore.\nAZCENTRAL\nPac-12 football power rankings - Week 7\nIn beating Oregon State, the Wildcats might have proved, at minimum, that they are not the conference’s worst team. The next few weeks will go a long way toward figuring out just where Arizona stands.\nThe Wildcats are favored, and might be the bettors’ choice in their next two games, a homecoming matchup with Washington State and at Washington.\nNone of those will be easy — just last week, the Cougars upset Oregon, and Washington beat USC. Both games were road wins.\n“From here on out, they get tougher and tougher,” Parks said. “Washington State beat Oregon, there’s so many teams that can play football now. That’s the conference we wanted to be a part of.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/65261cd0c95d3cee97be65499911b65e056bd5c6/c=721-0-3922-3201/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635803416484692899-numbaone.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c47d660a401556d2cda0cdf550493e6d1fa9b13/c=87-0-612-525/local/-/media/2015/08/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635762183712997114-arizonawildcats.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e47265371f176e1ca60045acf5227a963f0f1c0e/c=500-0-2500-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635803689974581132-Jake-Matthews.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/831e95a35ea452a38f2118a8117a0d8d99529895/c=1600-0-3643-2043/local/-/media/2015/10/15/Phoenix/Phoenix/635805390910709483-080915-spt-uafb-p8.1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:54:53.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
