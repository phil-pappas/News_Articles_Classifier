An Angels Camp Police Department Officer pulled over the driver of a Chevrolet HHR for expired registration about 11:15 a.m. The officer said he smelled a strong odor of marijuana coming from inside the Chevrolet, an Angels Camp Police Department press release said. A passenger said he had marijuana inside the vehicle and did not possess a valid physician’s recommendation to possess marijuana, the report said. The officer searched the driver and found a slungshot, a maritime tool with a weight knotted into a ball attached to the end of a cord. Edmund Santos, 40, of Angels Camp, was arrested on a charge of possessing the weapon, the report stated. Upon searching the HHR, a concealed loaded handgun was located, which the officer determined had been stolen in a burglary reported to the Calaveras Sheriff’s Department on Sept. 9, the report said. Santos was arrested and booked into the Calaveras County Jail on suspicion of possession of an illegal weapon, being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle, carrying a loaded stolen firearm, being a gang member carrying a loaded firearm and participating in a criminal street gang. Michael Airola, 67, of Angels Camp, was arrested and booked into Calaveras County Jail on suspicion of possession of marijuana for sale. A search warrant for Santos’ residence was attained at 11:30 p.m. Thursday. Angels Camp Police Department officers and Calaveras County Sheriff’s deputies searched a residence on the 600 block of Copello Drive in Angels Camp and discovered additional stolen firearms and narcotics. Santos was still being held Tuesday afternoon at Calaveras County Jail on $37,500 bail. Airola was released on Monday on his own recognizance.
