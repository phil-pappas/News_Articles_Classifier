RIDGEWOOD — Jimmy Conboy’s eyes lit up when the ball ricocheted from the goalie’s right hand to the forward’s right foot.\nA howitzer shot from George Edwards was knocked down by Emerson keeper Jake Leara, but he couldn’t control the rebound.\n\"[Edwards] rocketed it right at the goalkeeper and he played it right to me,\" Conboy said. \"It was definitely a lucky break.\"\nConboy calmly buried the shot for his second goal of the game midway through the first half, more than enough support for the impenetrable Ridgewood defense. Conboy scored the only goals of the game and the Maroons hung on for a 2-0 victory over Emerson in the opening round of the Bergen County tournament.\n\"We worked a great possession game in the first half that helped us in the final third,\" Ridgewood coach Joe Gyulay said. \"Offense and defense seems to be clicking right now and we’re looking forward to continuing in the tournament.\"\nThe Maroons (5-2-2) had a losing season in 2014 and missed the county tournament in each of the past two years. But Ridgewood has only allowed one goal in its past four games and now moves on to the Round of 16 to face third-seeded Tenafly on Sunday.\n\"I think we, being out of the tournament for two years, had a little incentive to play,\" Gyulay said. \"Being at home is a huge incentive to play. And I think our senior leadership is really starting to come through.\"\nRidgewood’s senior captain Luke Eckels helped the Maroons’ defense do something no other team has been able to do this season: shut out Emerson. The Cavaliers came into the game averaging just over four goals per game and midfielder Matt Nedilsky’s 11 scores rank among the best in North Jersey.\nBut the Maroons dominated possession in the midfield and spent most of the game in the offensive half.\nWhenever the Cavs ventured up the field, they were quickly turned away by the seasoned Maroons back line. Eckels and Charlie Cardew are returning starters while outside back Tyler Porfido returns after missing last season because of a concussion.\nThomas Benson, Ridgewood’s sophomore goalie, didn’t have to do much Thursday other than scoop up ground balls and bat away corner kicks. His only save came on a long shot from Nedilsky with 27 minutes left in the game.\n\"He definitely likes the four in front of him to make his life a little bit easier,\" Eckels said. \"But on his own, he’s a fantastic goalie and he’s made some really good saves this season.\"\nThe Maroons kept the pressure going throughout the game rather than settling for a 2-0 lead. Conboy caused havoc near the goal with his combination of size and speed and had several good chances to get a hat trick. He pounced on another juicy rebound late in the first half, but volleyed the ball right into the hands of Emerson’s keeper.\nConboy didn’t get a third goal, but it didn’t matter for the Maroons.\nTwo goals were all they needed.\n\"A third would have been nice but the clean sheet by the defense was amazing,\" Conboy said. \"We got the win and that’s all that matters.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:01.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
