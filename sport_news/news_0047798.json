(FILE - In this April 24, 2007, file photo, Los Angeles Lakers' Lamar Odom sits on the bench in the fourth quarter of a Western Conference playoff basketball game against the Phoenix Suns in Phoenix. Odom, who was embraced by teammates and television fans alike for his Everyman approach to fame, was found face-down and alone Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, after spending four days at the Love Ranch, a legal Nevada brothel. Lamar Odom is reminding us how difficult the end can be.\nAdChoices Sports often are said to build character and prepare athletes for \"real life,\" but the character being built can be good or bad, dependent on varied factors. What is less discussed is how athletes prepare for life after their sports careers are over. There have been numerous cases where athletes do not transition well after their careers are over.\nNot even 30 months after his last NBA game, Odom is on life support in a Las Vegas hospital after losing consciousness in a legal brothel. His story is one on the extreme end of a long line of tales of athletes struggling to leave behind the games they loved.\nMORE: Odom's career in photos | Odom just needs 'something to hold on to,' says mentor\nOdom played in the NBA from 1999 to 2013, a remarkably talented player and beloved teammate. He shined in the Los Angeles spotlight, first as a star with the Clippers, then as a two-time NBA champion with the Lakers. He found even more fame as the former husband of Khloe Kardashian, becoming a regular on \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" and getting a spinoff, \"Khloe & Lamar.\"\nOne of Odom's first coaches and long-time mentors, Alvin Gentry, told Sporting News that Khloe was a positive influence on Lamar, whose life has been full of turmoil. Odom's father had been addicted to heroin, his mother died when he was 12 and he lost a son who was only 6 1/2 months old, as chronicled in a 2009 Sports Illustrated feature . Odom certainly has had his challenges, the turmoil that helps us understand the bouts with depression and drug abuse in the years after his career ended.\nWhile some athletes imply they are ready for life after sports, when the time actually comes, coping with the new life is usually not easy. Predicting athletes' responses to the end of their careers is almost impossible, yet in some cases similar reactions occur. Still, responses can be as varied as the athletes involved. Many athletes experience a typical grief response similar to dealing with other catastrophic life events such as a death in the family or loss of the home due to a fire.\nSometimes a crucial factor is the reason for the end of the athlete's career. For athletes who choose to retire on their own volition, there is a greater likelihood being able to better handle the retirement scene. Having a sense of being in control of one's own destiny is an important psychological factor that should not be overlooked and can have a lasting impact on the early years of the athlete's new life.\nIf, as with Odom, an athlete is cut or has to retire due to injury or illness, it can be common for the athlete to experience resentment, depression, and a \"life is not fair\" outlook in the time following the end of the career. The athlete was not allowed to stop playing on his or her own terms, which can feel like unfinished business.\nA common reaction for athletes at the end of their sports career is to experience a sense of a loss of identity. Being an athlete has been an important part of his or her everyday life, and now that part of their personality or lifestyle is gone. The sometimes imposing challenge is to try to find another life endeavor to help fill that void. In most cases, the new adventure will not enjoy the media and fan attention or status that comes with being a popular athlete.\nSome former athletes have been successful in business ventures (Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan) or as sports announcers (Charles Barkley, Doug Collins) that \"keep them busy.\" Yet these endeavors usually do not provide the same adrenaline rush experienced while playing sports. In attempting to find action exciting and exhilarating as playing sports, sometimes athletes will make risky choices to re-live those feelings.\nIn my work with current athletes, they often experience difficulties during the offseason because of the lack of a required, structured schedule. Once a career has ended, this problem can be more magnified. Now athletes have more time on their hands and more freedom to use that time as they see fit — which can be positive or negative depending upon the athletes' choices. Having been involved in a very structured environment for numerous years, then to suddenly have a lot of time available, can be overwhelming, scary, or at least difficult transition.\nAs is true in non-sport contexts, even though one may look forward to retirement, it can still be a tricky time in anyone's life. For athletes whose careers are experienced within a condensed time-frame and in high-profile style, the challenge presented may be the truest test of sports' reputation for preparing participants for real world experiences.\nDr. Kevin L.
