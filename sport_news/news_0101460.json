And his Louisville teams could not get past Pitt for three straight years since the school joined the Big East in 2006.\nBut the fifth-ranked Cardinals got to celebrate Saturday night. They finally wore out a courageous Syracuse team, 76-66, with suffocating pressure in the second half to win the championship before a sellout crowd at the Garden. The Louisville pep band played \"My Old Kentucky Home.\" The players cut down the nets. But Pitino was nowhere to be found, disappearing into the locker room. \"It's their time to be in the spotlight,\" he said. \"They do all the work. I just went in, wrote a couple things on the board. But, my insides are just gushing with pride.\"\nThe victory should lock up a No. 1 seed for Louisville (28-5) and reaffirmed what everyone connected with college basketball already knows.\n\"Rick definitely belongs in the Naismith Hall of Fame,\" retiring Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said. \"He's taken three different teams - Providence, Kentucky and Louisville - to the Final Four, won a national championship at Kentucky (in 1996) and was the first coach to really embrace the 3-point shot after it was introduced (in 1986).\"\nThe Cards, who have won 10 straight, got 15 points from 6-8 freshman Samardo Samuels - a former St. Benedict's of Newark star - and put six players in double figures. They shot 61% in the second half when they outscored Syracuse, 46-28, putting a end to the Orange's quest to create one of the great fairy-tale endings in Big East history.\nPitino has always been a student of history, but after he left the Celtics in 2001, he wanted to shy away from the type of tradition that can strangle you.\n\"I don't think I would have this job if Louisville had been in the Big East,\" he said. \"I wanted to do something different, not that I had a secret desire to coach in Conference USA . When it all happened, there was a fear some of our football schools might defect and our AD Tom Jurich asked me to call Mike Tranghese to help us get into the Big East for football.\n\"I forgot what I was getting into in basketball.\"\nPitino made a trip down memory lane during a return to the Garden, where he spent time as an assistant to Hubie Brown with the Knicks and later as their head coach. \"Walking in, I always remember when I was an assistant with the Knicks because we had to park across the street, at a place called Park-n-Lock,\" Pitino recalled. \"We would always stay at the Park-n-Lock. We would go (past) about 180 (cars) before we could leave the building and I always remember the people, if we were lost, yelling at us, so we were walking so fast. Then, we finally got a chance to park inside.\n\"I have so many memories of Bernard King and winning the Atlantic Division championship and coaching a young team.\n\"I can really go back to when I was just an average basketball player and signed my letter of intent with UMass on the Garden floor the day Julius Erving lost to Marquette by 30 in the NIT.\"\nPitino got his first big coaching break from Syracuse's Jim Boeheim , a longtime friend who hired Pitino as an assistant in 1976. The night Pitino got married, Boeheim approached him at the reception and broached the question about recruiting a key prospect the next day. Pitino cut his honeymoon short, flew to Cincinnati and helped sign Louis Orr , a skinny 6-8 forward who became a huge star for the Orange in the late '70s.\nPitino went on to become Brown's assistant with the Knicks before leaving to cut his teeth in the Big East with Providence. He returned to the Knicks in 1987, then took over a scandal-plagued Kentucky program two years later, bringing one of the most storied programs in the country back to life as the Wildcats reached the Final Four three times between 1993 and 1997.\nIf he had stayed at UK instead of leaving for the Celtics, he would have had the same aura surrounding him as Mike Krzyzewski and might have won more NCAA championships than Adolph Rupp , who won four.\nRupp was always known as \"The Man in the Brown Suit.\" Pitino prefers Armani. In this city, it definitely works.\ndweiss@nydailynews.com Live NCAA scores Related News Air Force star overcomes depression to soar for Falcons Syracuse Orange falls to Louisville Cardinals in Big East title game End Zone: Rice stars find college is no slam dunk Syracuse's 6-OT win remains talk of town Louisville tops 'Nova and reaches Big East title game Syracuse needs just one OT to top West Virginia, reach final Weiss: Syracuse lore keeps growing at the Garden", "external_links": ["http://nydailynews.pa-sportsticker.com/site/ncaab/schedule/"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:21:41.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
