Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 11:17 AM Updated at 11:26 AM Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 11:17 AM Updated at 11:26 AM Most sports are the same: Do something good and you get to celebrate. You see football players create extravagant touchdown dances, baseball players perfect \"the bat flip\" after a home run and basketball players talk trash after a dunk. Volleyball is no different. After each point, the rewarded team usually comes together to celebrate as loud as possible. Amid the fans yelling inside a small, compact gymnasium, there are players doing the same. Choctaw's Evelina Teran is at the top of the volume scale. \"I'm pretty high on the loud scale,\" the junior hitter said. \"I get pretty excited. I love how everyone gets excited but I feel I'm one of the loudest on the team.\" She had plenty of reason Thursday to be loud, too. Choctaw swept Fort Walton Beach in the District 2-6A championship, the fifth meeting between the rivals after the sides split the first two encounters. Teran finished with 13 kills in the match -- after 11 in the semifinals against Crestview -- and gets the honor of Athlete of the Week. Part of it is because, well, she's definitely the most celebratory of the Indians group. What is the team's pre-match routine? \"After we do warmups, we pray in the middle of the huddle and then do 'Tribe on three' and then go out and play. When we have time, we play a game called 'Zoo.' Everyone has an animal and it's hard to explain but we laugh and have a good time.\" How much did playing Crestview help against Fort Walton Beach, which hadn't played in a week before the championship? \"I felt it helped keep our energy up. If you lose it, it's hard to get it back. Having that game helped us think, 'We want this. This is the most important game.' Without this game, it was over.\" If you could spend an entire day binge-watching an entire series on Netflix, which would you pick? \"I would want to watch 'Friends.' I remember watching it as a kid and getting so upset when the last season ended.\" How did you become a volleyball player? \"I went into school my sixth-grade year (Liza Jackson), because I was home-schooled before. They said I had to do one sport for field day activities. I decided to do volleyball. I just randomly picked volleyball. No family past or anything. I scored one point and liked it. I went into seventh grade and did volleyball again at field day. I went into eighth grade and decided I liked the sport enough to try out for the team. I look at volleyball and think, 'How did this happen? Me in this sport?' I get that all the team.\" Page 2 of 2 - If you could pick your last meal, what would it be? \"I'd probably want some mac 'n' cheese. I'm someone who judges based off your mac 'n' cheese. If you don't have good mac 'n' cheese, my respect for you goes down. I'd probably want a hamburger. And then for dessert, I'd want chocolate cake.\" Is there any sport you want to try? \"I always liked baseball as a child. Not softball, baseball. I'd always ask for a baseball or something as a child, so each year I'd get a baseball or a bat. I'd definitely want to try baseball.\" How much fun is it playing in the Choctaw-Fort Walton Beach rivalry? \"The first time we played them my freshman year, I was shaking so much. As time went on, it became so exciting. You have the student sections going wild and two great teams. Sometimes I have to remind myself to breathe because it's so exciting. I don't know how to explain that feeling.\" If you could only go to one restaurant for the rest of your life, which would you go to? \"I'd probably choose Golden Corral. We went there as a child and I loved it. They also have good mac 'n' cheese and like I said, I'm big on mac 'n' cheese. So that's probably my choice.\" Athlete of the Week finalists Daniel Orcutt, Fort Walton Beach : The swimmer won two District 1-2A championships Thursday. He took the 200-yard individual medley and the 100 backstroke, the only local swimmer at the event to claim a district title. Jeffrey Sober, Rocky Bayou : Also a swimmer, Sober won the 100 butterfly and 500 freestyle events at the District 1-1A championship. The young athlete moves on to the Region 1-1A meet, where he can add to his accomplished season. Kaide Farne, Niceville : The golfer tied teammate and usual-suspect on this list, Lauren Miller, with a 1-under-par 70 at the Region 1-3A tournament. That helped the Eagles take the crown and qualify for the state tournament next week. Brady Ooten, Fort Walton Beach : The sophomore quarterback tossed five touchdowns in a 41-40 loss to Bay. Despite the defeat, Ooten helped rally the Vikings from a 28-7 deficit in the second quarter. He finished with 293 passing yards.
