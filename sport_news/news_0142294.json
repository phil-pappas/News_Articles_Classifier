The older man would give the boy methamphetamine, the teen told investigators, and force him into sex acts with house guests.\nThe teen told investigators he \"even went so far as to not bathe for a couple of days so he would smell bad in hopes Martin-Croft would not want to be with him sexually,\" the warrant says.\nLocal and federal authorities say Martin-Croft's case is emblematic of a trend eliciting more attention in the Denver area in which boys have fallen victim to older men who offer shelter in exchange for sex. These perpetrators, police and activists say, are known as \"sugar daddies.\"\n\"The flip side is you'll typically end up (sexually exploited),\" said Denver police Sgt. Daniel Steele, a supervisor for the FBI's Rocky Mountain Innocence Lost Task Force.\nMartin-Croft pleaded guilty in August to contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Prosecutors dropped 13 other counts, including child sex assault and child prostitution, court records show.\nMartin-Croft, who has said in Facebook postings he is innocent, is free on bond ahead of an Oct. 23 sentencing.\nAdvertisement \"My client, as far as he knew, was dealing with an adult,\" said Charles Leidner, Martin-Croft's attorney. \"As far as I'm concerned, this case is being prosecuted based on Mr. Martin-Croft's lifestyle and nothing more.\"\nBut Steele says perpetrators of this type of exploitation seek out vulnerable children and lure them in with promises of help. Drugs are often involved, Steele says, and sometimes even physical violence.\nThe dark pattern has stepped into the public eye over the last several weeks after the Sept. 16 arrest of 48-year-old Sean Crumpler, who is accused of sex trafficking teen boys out of a rented, upscale southeast Aurora home. Crumpler faces 12 counts , including charges of child sex trafficking and child sex assault.\nCrumpler allegedly told one of his teen victims, according to an arrest affidavit, that he finds \"young boys to bring back to the house\" and that he calls his efforts \"hunting.\"\nTwo 16-year-olds — including one recruited from California — were living in Crumpler's Aurora home, according to the affidavit, along with about a dozen men between 18 and 21.\nNew arrivals would earn housing and food through sex, the document said.\n\"We've never seen this before,\" Anne Darr, the FBI Denver division's victim specialist who worked on the case, said of the scale in Crumpler's case.\n\"I think the whole community is very hidden,\" Steele said of boys exploited by so-called sugar daddies.\nThe FBI's Denver task force says it has recently seen a Texas boy trafficked in Aurora and another in Conifer.\n\"Trafficking is about exploiting vulnerabilities,\" Steele said. \"Regardless if it's a boy or a girl, vulnerable populations can be exploited.\"\nAmanda Finger, executive director of the Denver-based Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking, said she has been hearing more and more about sugar daddy cases \"over the past few years.\"\n\"I think there tends to be a lot of attention focusing on pimping and trafficking of young girls,\" she said. \"When we talk about young boys, that tends to look a little bit different.\"\nFinger said boys are often exploited by a single perpetrator who is much older than the victim.\nMary Durant, who runs Prax(us), a nonprofit in Denver that helps boys vulnerable to human trafficking, said sugar daddies are nothing new in the Mile High City.\n\"It's not that we are seeing more of it, it's just that some folks are more aware of it,\" she said.\nDurant explained that the exploitation usually starts out as an exchange for sex and then matures into a controlling relationship.\nRecently, Durant says she has been seeing boys — some of them underage — being offered and accepting $100 to film pornography in Denver.\nSeveral of the men living in Crumpler's house were active on social media posting nude photos and videos of themselves having sex.\n\"There's a big demand for boys,\" she said. \"We just don't talk about it as a community. We just don't want to talk about it.\"\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or @JesseAPaul", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:02:44.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
