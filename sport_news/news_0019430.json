He is a good man. He is a good coach and we cannot wait for the day when he’s back on the field doing what he loves. And that’s coaching football.” \nHelton mentioned a couple of times that this is his second stint serving as interim coach. He took over for prior interim coach Ed Orgeron in 2013, who did not stick around after Sarkisian was announced as successor to fired coach Lane Kiffin, and coached the Trojans to a 45-20 victory over Fresno State in the Las Vegas Bowl. \nThe interim coach then took care of some laundry, like listing off player injuries and noting that tight ends coach Marques Tuiasosopo will become the new USC quarterbacks coach and that offensive administrative assistant Lenny Vandermade will assume the vacant role of tight end coach. \nHe thanked the players for accepting him in the new role and his staff for enabling a smooth transition. \n“The professionalism that they’ve shown in this situation blows me away,” Helton said. “Their care and concern for our players and their want-to for them to succeed is staggering and I think they’re doing a tremendous job.” \nOther Pac-12 coaches expressed sympathy for Sarkisian and expressed their well wishes. \n“I can’t really imagine what it would be like to do that. Especially to go through it publicly, like he has,” California coach Sonny Dykes said. “My thoughts and prayers are with his family and coaches and players.” \nThere is still some turmoil surrounding the USC program. Athletic director Pat Haden has come under fire for not addressing earlier signs of Sarkisian’s struggles with alcohol more forcefully, with many Los Angeles and national media members suggesting or outright declaring that Haden should also be dismissed. \nOn Tuesday, school president Max Nikias expressed his “unwavering support” for Haden. The athletic director then said that while he takes responsibility for Sarkisian’s short, unsuccessful tenure at USC, he still believes hiring the former Trojans assistant under Pete Carroll was the right choice. \nThe best way for Helton to cope with that turmoil would be to win, frequently and immediately. When Kiffin was fired in 2013 the team was galvanized under Orgeron, going 6-2 under the former Mississippi head coach. \n“We’re very excited about what the future holds here at USC,” Helton said. “It’s still an extremely special place that is not only one of the top academic universities in the world, but also has a tradition of excellence on the football field and we plan to continue that happening.” \nAdams’ status a mystery \nOregon is taking a “wait-and-see” approach with starting quarterback Vernon Adams’ availability for this weekend’s game at Washington, coach Mark Helfrich told reporters. \nAdams, a transfer from Eastern Washington, has a broken index finger that makes him unable to make a football spin when he throws. Washington coach Chris Petersen said he expects Adams to play on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:05:11.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
