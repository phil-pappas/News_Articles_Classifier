Returning after missing two games with a calf injury, Cyprien made 14 tackles and had one fumble recovery. These were encouraging steps for a player we’ve maligned for not being around the football enough and not consistently making the open-field tackle. “He made some plays,” coach Gus Bradley said. “You saw him down in the box more and at the line of scrimmage more. I thought he did pretty well.” The Jaguars’ coaches may have unlocked the secret for Cyprien being productive. Keep him close to the line of scrimmage. \nCLOCK MISMANAGEMENT \nWhy were the Jaguars seemingly settling for a field goal late in the first half? In a 10-10 game, a drive that started at their 20-yard line with 6:04 on the clock had snaked its way to the Indianapolis 16 with one minute remaining. The Jaguars had two timeouts remaining. Certainly time for plenty of work. Unless you’re the Jaguars. On first down, Blake Bortles threw incomplete, stopping the clock with 55 seconds remaining. On second down, Yeldon carried up the middle for one yard. But the clock ran … and ran … and ran. By the time Bortles threw incomplete on third-and-nine, nine seconds remained. Had he converted the situation, chances are Bortles would have had just one chance at the end zone. Jason Myers’ 32-yard field goal was good. This falls on Bradley. Why be so concerned about giving the Colts possession with time remaining? Extend the game with the timeouts to give the offense maximum opportunity to score a touchdown. \nCALLING ALL KICKERS (OR JUST ONE) \nThe Jaguars vowed to be patient with Myers when they decided Aug. 31 to trade Josh Scobee to Pittsburgh for a sixth-round pick. But, wow, how much more can Bradley and general manager Dave Caldwell see — or in this case, not see — before moving on? Myers is 7-of-10 on field goals and 5-of-6 on extra points. His missed point-after against Carolina was a deflator (it meant the Jaguars went into halftime down 10-9) and his two missed field goals on Sunday were of the game-costing variety. Bradley ignored a question about his patience level with Myers (right). We grant Scobee’s troubles with the Steelers (he was cut this weekend), but what about calling him in for a tryout on Tuesday? And the same goes for any other kicker the Jaguars feel is worth a call. At this point, everything should be considered. \nMORE RYAN DAVIS, PLEASE \nThe Jaguars view Ryan Davis as a situational player. His playing time in the first three games bear that out — 14, 23 and 16 snaps. We’re guessing the Jaguars think the more he plays, the less effective he’ll be. But it’s time to test his limits. His play-time total won’t be known until Monday, but what we do know is he had 11/2 sacks and a forced fumble that was recovered by the Colts. Is Chris Clemons really better than Davis? It’s time to find out. \nMUST WIN IN TAMPA \nIf asked, our goal for the Jaguars in Weeks 1-7 would have been two or three wins. They have one win — against getting-more-dreadful-and-dysfunctional-by-the-week Miami — but are 1-3 entering the second quarter of the season. The goal for this outfit was to play meaningful games in late November and December. Be good enough so the Times-Union doesn’t have to resurrect our annual “Race To The Top Pick,” chart. To avoid that, the Jaguars must beat Tampa Bay. The Jaguars couldn’t beat gray-beard quarterback Matt Hasselbeck on Sunday so they have to find a way to beat rookie Jameis Winston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:35:59.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
