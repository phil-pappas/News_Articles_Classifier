The Tigers now sit at 6–0, and have a very real chance to make a run at an undefeated regular season. Here are three takeaways from Memphis’s afternoon upset.\n1. Memphis has become a dark-horse College Football Playoff threat\nBefore we get too far ahead of ourselves, keep in mind that it’s only mid-October, and plenty can change between now and Championship Saturday. The American Athletic Conference is surprisingly deep this season, with Houston , Temple , East Carolina and Navy all boasting strong outfits.\nStill, this Memphis team is very good. And with its toughest matchup suddenly in the rearview mirror, it now seems like a real possibility that the Tigers could spark an outpouring of playoff debate come November and December.\n• NIESEN: Justin Fuente, Paxton Lynch and Memphis's rise into a contender\nLet’s start with what they did well Saturday. Quarterback Paxton Lynch , the 6’ 7”, 245-pound redshirt junior who was overlooked as a recruit coming out of Deltona, Fla., went 39 of 52 for 383 yards with three touchdowns and only one interception that came on a deflection in which his pass bounced straight up in the air. Lynch was at his best when it mattered most: He went 4 of 5 during the drive that pushed Memphis’s lead to 24–14 before the half, and completed two third-down attempts on the opening drive of the third quarter to help make the score 31–14.\nCollege Football Iowa trounces Northwestern, opens path to Big Ten title, playoff berth by Chris Johnson", "external_links": ["http://www.campusrush.com/justin-fuente-paxton-lynch-memphis-tigers-1402465438.html?xid=si_social"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:57:40.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
