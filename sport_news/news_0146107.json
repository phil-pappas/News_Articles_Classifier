Long way to go.” \nDull, who is trying to become the first caddie to qualify for the Masters since 2000 Mid-Am champ Greg Puga, sank a 10-foot birdie to halve the 17th hole. He also made a key par save on the 18th hole, nearly chipping in from a difficult lie in front of the green. \n“I didn’t play well this morning at all,” Dull said. “He gave me the first couple of holes. I hit some loose shots and didn’t take advantage of any opportunities. \n“I missed a couple of short putts inside 4 feet. The match should be tied. We’re still within striking distance, so it’s there to be had.” \nSchmidt, who used to play recreational hockey left-handed, says the key for him is to concentrate on his score. \n“I want to shoot under par,” he said. “Just get a good start; that’s my focus.” \nThe final 18 holes start at 12:30. \nThe winner receives an invitation to the Masters, a 10-year exemption into the Mid-Am, a two-year exemption into the U.S. Amateur and is exempt from local U.S. Open qualifying for the next three U.S. Opens. \nThe runner-up gets a three-year exemption into the Mid-Am, a spot in next year’s U.S. Amateur and is exempt from local qualifying for next year’s U.S. Open.
