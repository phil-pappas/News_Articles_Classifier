The Hillbillies' used a 42-point first half to put the Roughriders away early. \nVerona rushed for five touchdowns in the game, and added three scores through the air. Senior receiver John DeMartinis was responsible for two of the three receiving touchdowns and said it was nice to see the offense throw the ball more often. Zach Gewelb/Staff photographer Senior running back Mark Riggio breaks a tackle in the first quarter. \n\"I think we played well. We passed the ball a little bit more than we usually do and threw it pretty well,\" he said. \"I think it can be a good weapon for us, alongside running the football.\" \nVerona took the lead on its first possession when senior running back Mark Riggio found the end zone from 18 yards out. Sophomore CJ Lavery added to the Hillbillies' advantage when he scored on a long touchdown run, which increased Verona's lead to 14-0. Junior quarterback Zack Zaccone capped off the first quarter scoring with a 48-yard touchdown pass to DeMartinis. Zach Gewelb/Staff photographer Senior receiver John DeMartinis hauls in a pass along the sideline in the second quarter. \n\"I ran a corner route and I was open,\" DeMartinis said. \"I caught the ball and saw I had some space and just ran down the field.\" \nLavery replaced Zaccone at the beginning of the second quarter and increased Verona's lead to 28-0 when he found junior receiver Collin Kiernan through the air for a 23-yard touchdown with 9:48 remaining in the half. The Hillbillies' scored about three minutes later when senior running back Sean Crawford dashed for a 40-yard score. \nAfter the defense forced a turnover with about one minute remaining in the half, head coach Lou Racioppe elected to put Zaccone back in the game. The veteran coach pushed the right button, as the junior quarterback hit DeMartinis in stride along the sideline. The senior receiver reeled in the pass and beat the West Side defense for a 60-yard touchdown, which gave the Hillbillies a 42-0 lead heading into halftime. \n\"It was nice to see,\" Racioppe said of Verona's strong passing attack. \"We haven't really had to throw the ball very much... and for them to be able to get opportunities to throw and hit the receivers, I think it opens up a whole new avenue for us and makes teams prepare for our passing game a little bit.\" \nAfter forcing West Side to punt on the opening possession of the second half, Verona went back to work and scored its seventh touchdown of the game. Riggio ran for a 20-yard touchdown - his second of the game - and gave the Hillbillies a 49-0 lead with 55 seconds left in the third quarter. Riggio was quick to divert credit to his teammates for his strong rushing performance. \n\"Every single run I had was because of the [offensive] line,\" he said. \"Every game, they deserve a bunch of credit for what they do. They work very hard in practice and it shows during games.\" \nRacioppe was also impressed with the way the offensive line has played, not only in the game against West Side, but throughout the course of the season. \n\"That's really our strength,\" Racioppe said. \"Those guys have been around for a couple of years now and they do a great job of opening holes.\" \nMost starters exited the game in the fourth quarter and the younger players had a chance to garner some game experience. Verona increased its lead to 56-0 when sophomore running back Matt DiDia found a hole in the West Side defense and crossed the goal line with 2:47 left to play. \nThe Hillbillies surrendered their only touchdown on the following kickoff, when the coverage team allowed the West Side returner to run the ball back for a touchdown. The Roughriders missed the extra point and the 56-6 score would hold until the end of the game. \nDespite allowing the late score, Racioppe said he was pleased with the way the defense played, specifically the first-stringers. \n\"They haven't given up a point all season,\" he said. \"I think we're pretty good, but we'll find out Friday [against Shabazz].\" \nVerona will travel to Newark Friday, Oct. 16 to take on Shabazz in a key showdown that could have playoff implications. Racioppe noted how Shabazz has more talent than some of Verona's recent opponents and said his team needs to play better moving forward. \n\"We had way too many penalties today. I think we were a little sloppy coming off the bye week and maybe we were looking ahead to Shabazz, so we just need to tighten things up a little bit,\" Racioppe said. \nRiggio said the Hillbillies can't be satisfied with their performance yet and expects his teammates to work hard in practice before their showdown with Shabazz. \n\"We played well today. Obviously, there were a few mistakes on offense and defense, but there's nothing we can do about it now,\" Riggio said. \"We have to look past it and focus on our next game. We're prepping hard for them and it's going to be a good game.Hi \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:58:12.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
