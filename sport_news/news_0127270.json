Melbourne hosted the World Cup of Golf in 1959, 1972, 1988 and 2013. \n\nIn 2013, the event was a 72-hole stroke play tournament held at The Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Jason Day shot a final-round 70 to win the individual tournament, and he paired with Adam Scott to claim the team prize. In 2016, the World Cup will return to its original team format. \n\nBoth events will be played in the November timeframe in 2016 and 2019 on one of Melbourne's premier Sandbelt Golf Courses. The venue and exact dates will be announced at a later time. \n\n\"The PGA TOUR and the International Federation of PGA Tours are elated to partner with the State of Victoria and bring The Presidents Cup and World Cup of Golf back to Australia,\" said Finchem. \n\n\"Australia is home to some of the best golfers on the PGA TOUR - not to mention some of the world's most passionate fans - and we know Victoria will stage wonderful events for the competitors, as well as fans visiting and watching around the globe. The success of the recent 2011 Presidents Cup and 2013 World Cup of Golf has reinforced Victoria's stature as a global golf destination.\" \n\n\"I'm very, very happy that we're returning to Melbourne, where I won the World Cup,\" said Day, one of four Australians competing in The Presidents Cup 2015. \n\n\"It's exciting news, anytime Australia gets big events\" said Scott, a seven-time Presidents Cup participant. \n\n\"Obviously with the World Cup going back and Jason and I having won it the last time it was played in Melbourne, I look forward to hopefully playing again, and the same for The Presidents Cup.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:23:20.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
