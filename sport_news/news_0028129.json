The rally was attended by activists, labor unions and members of the pro-Kurdish party, and came just weeks before Turkey holds a new election Nov. 1.\nA group of about 70 mourners were eventually allowed to enter the cordoned-off area outside the capital's main train station Sunday to briefly pay their respects for the victims.\nThe group of mourners then began to march toward a central square in Ankara, chanting slogans against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom many hold responsible for the spiraling violence that has plagued Turkey since the summer.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Kurdish rebels and Islamic State militants were the most likely culprits.\nYeni Safak, a newspaper close to the government, said investigators had determined that one of the bombers was a male about 25 or 30.\nThe attacks came at a tense time for Turkey, a NATO member that borders war-torn Syria, hosts more refugees than any other nation in the world and has seen renewed fighting with Kurdish rebels that has left hundreds dead in the last few months.\nTurkey agreed to take a more active role in the U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State group. Turkey opened up its bases to U.S. aircraft to launch air raids on the extremist group in Syria and carried out a limited number of strikes on the group itself.\nCritics have accused Erdogan of inflaming tensions and re-igniting the fighting with the Kurds in the hope that the turmoil would rally voters back to the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP. Electoral gains by the pro-Kurdish party caused the ruling party, founded by Erdogan, to lose its parliamentary majority in a June election after a decade of single-party rule.\nErdogan condemned the attacks which he said targeted the country's unity and called for solidarity.\nVideo captures suicide bombings that killed 95 people at Ankara peace rally Tribune wire reports Nearly simultaneous explosions targeted a Turkish peace rally Saturday in Ankara, killing at least 95 people and wounding hundreds in Turkey's deadliest attack in years — one that threatens to inflame the nation's ethnic tensions.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility but Prime Minister...\nNearly simultaneous explosions targeted a Turkish peace rally Saturday in Ankara, killing at least 95 people and wounding hundreds in Turkey's deadliest attack in years — one that threatens to inflame the nation's ethnic tensions.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility but Prime Minister...\n(Tribune wire reports) Associated Press\n Middle East Turkey Europe Recep Tayyip Erdogan Islamic State", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619143a/turbine/la-fg-blasts-rock-ankara-turkey-pictures-20151010", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619013c/turbine/ct-turkey-bomb-attacks-20151010", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561957bb/turbine/la-fg-blasts-rock-ankara-turkey-pictures-20151-005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561a4dbe/turbine/ct-turkey-bombing-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561957b2/turbine/la-fg-blasts-rock-ankara-turkey-pictures-20151-008"], "published": "2015-10-11T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:00:09.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
