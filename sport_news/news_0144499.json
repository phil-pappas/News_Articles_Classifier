The East Face project, which is designed to reduce the risk of large wildfires, includes almost 50,000 acres of public land, mostly Forest Service with about 1,200 acres of BLM ground. The area is along the east side of the Elkhorns, mainly from the Anthony Lakes Highway north toward the Grande Ronde Valley. The East Face project, which also involves the Oregon Department of Forestry and the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, also is designed as a guide for similar work on adjacent private lands. The environmental assessment is available for a 30-day public comment period. The agencies’ preferred alternative — one of five strategies analyzed in the assessment — calls for commercial logging on 6,700 acres, with a total volume of 16.4 million board-feet. The preferred alternative — No. 2 in the study — also proposes building 5.3 miles of new, temporary road, rebuilding 53 miles of existing roads, and temporarily re-opening 107 miles of closed roads.
