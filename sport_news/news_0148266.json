The Bulldogs haven’t missed a beat. They won their 10th match in a row on Monday night. “The culture of our program and our expectations are very high,” Lyman coach Marty Gomez said. “They love playing volleyball. A lot of them play a lot of club. I’m happy. They want to uphold that culture and they come to practice to compete.” Matched up against the defending Class M state champions, Granby Memorial, the Bulldogs did just that. After falling behind early in the first set, they rallied and captured a hard-fought 3-2 decision. The victory was the 100th in Gomez’s six years as head coach of the Bulldogs. That’s a little behind his 448 career wins as the school’s baseball coach. “I’m so glad I got involved with this when I gave the (athletic director’s) job up nine years ago,” Gomez said. “When I was the AD, I was around when the program started and I said, if the opportunity ever presented itself, this is a sport that I might like to coach.” Steve Lewis asked him to become the assistant coach, which he accepted, nine years ago and three years later, Gomez took over when Lewis resigned. “I have had tremendous assistant coaches — volleyball people — (former assistant) Beau Lucas and (current assistant) Amanda Nappi are special people and special coaches who work hard at the game of volleyball,” Gomez said. It was Nappi who identified the key on Monday against the Bears. According to Gomez, Nappi told him early on to be concerned about Granby’s attack and service, but its defense might its weakness. If Lyman could also get the Granby setter moving, it would also be beneficial. But it took a little while. The Bulldogs (10-1) fell behind in the first set, 14-4, and Gomez noticed his team was very tight on the floor. “We were concerned, but we work together. We have fire and energy and work well together,” said junior setter Katy Konow who finished with 27 assists. “It’s hard to explain Katy,” Gomez said with a shake of his head. “She’s a tremendous competitor and very athletic, makes a lot of plays for us. She has got a lot better in her fundamental approach to being a setter. She’s something to watch.” Page 2 of 2 - Lyman settled down and began to attack and that helped Konow and Lyman’s passing game. Two kills and a block from Andee Bender (12 kills) cut the Granby lead to five, 19-14. Katee Meese and Meg Verizzi then helped serve Lyman back into the match with Verizzi getting five consecutive points, two on aces, to tie it at 20. Bre Boutin added a pair of nice serves and an illegal hit on the final point gave the Bulldogs a 25-22 win. “We were starting to let it get to our heads and then we just went on a run. It was great. We were all so excited and pumped that we just ran with it,” said senior Kristina Olenick. But it was still an up-and-down match the remainder of the way. Granby (8-1) rallied to take the second set, 25-21, only to see Lyman roll to a 25-10 victory in the third. “That was surprising,” said Olenick, who finished with nine kills and three blocks. “We did not expect to go out there and do that so easily.” Gomez almost expected what came next, a 25-21 Granby win in the fourth set. “It’s a game of runs and you just trade them back and forth,” the Lyman coach said. That momentum flipped back to Lyman in the tiebreaker as five straight service points by Mackenna Jordan (16 service points) gave the Bulldogs a lead they would not relinquish. Gomez said just because Lyman beat the defending Class M state champion doesn’t mean it will be easy the rest of the way. “I think we’re going to be one of those teams capable of making a real strong run in the state tournament and these types of games (will help),” Gomez said. The names of the Granby players were not available as the Granby head coach refused to provide a physical copy of his team’s roster.
