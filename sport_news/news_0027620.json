The Israeli was moderately wounded and the attacker was apprehended and beaten by local residents before he too was taken to a hospital.\nSince the Jewish New Year last month, five Israelis have been killed and dozens wounded in a shooting, a stoning and a series of stabbings. At least 26 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire, including 10 identified by Israel as attackers and the rest in clashes between stone-throwers and Israeli troops. Hundreds of Palestinians have been wounded in such confrontations.\nOn Monday, Palestinians carried out three stabbings in Jerusalem, leaving a teenage Israeli boy in critical condition.\nThe unrest began last month with clashes at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site and quickly spread across Israel and into the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nThe stabbings have rattled Israel. The attackers, many of them teenagers, have had no affiliation with militant groups, and the seemingly random nature of the stabbings has made it difficult to predict or prevent them.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under heavy criticism for failing to stop the violence, and an opinion poll this week showed that more than 70 percent of the public is dissatisfied with his handling of the crisis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:14:13.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
