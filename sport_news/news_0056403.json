(AP Photo/Kathy Kmonicek) Sponsored Links The Associated Press NEW YORK â€” \nWashington Nationals ace Max Scherzer is pitching a no-hitter through eight innings against the New York Mets. \nScherzer already has thrown a no-hitter this season, in June against Pittsburgh. \nThe NL East champion Mets haven't come close to a hit off Scherzer. He has struck out his last seven batters and 15 overall without a walk. \nThe Mets' only runner reached on a throwing error by third baseman Yunel Escobar on Kevin Plawecki's leadoff grounder in the sixth. \nScherzer has thrown 93 pitches on a brisk, blustery night at Citi Field in the second game of a day-night doubleheader. Washington leads 2-0. \nThis was the fifth time this season that Scherzer took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning. The 2013 AL Cy Young winner with Detroit is in his first year with the Nationals.
