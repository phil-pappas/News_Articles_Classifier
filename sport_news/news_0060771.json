We are playing against a big team. \n\"We know we have put ourselves in a bad position in the Champions League. And we want to make something special against Bayern because that's the only way we can stay in the race.\" \nWenger admitted he had been tempted to rest Sanchez as the forward had travelled to South America and back to play two games for Chile, which saw him score two goals. \n\"Yes, I was,\" he said. \"But yesterday, in the training session, he looked quite sharp and the medical people told me he had no problem at all.\" \nSanchez opened the scoring with a shot that went in off a post after Ozil had seemingly been brought down in the box by Nathan Ake. \nOzil then set up Giroud for the second and Sanchez and Ozil were both involved for Ramsey's third. \nThe setback does not leave Watford in any relegation danger but manager Quique Sanchez Flores was disappointed that his players wilted in the second half. \n\"In the first half we played well and in the first 15 minutes of the second half but when Arsenal found space it was different. We will have to analyse why this happened.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:27:09.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
