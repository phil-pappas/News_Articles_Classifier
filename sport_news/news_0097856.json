It shattered the old record set by 42 flyers in June.\nWeiss said the record was verified by a panel of judges from Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the international group that keeps track of skydiving and other aviation-related records.\nOne judge on the ground witnessed the jumpers leap from three separate aircraft at 13,500 feet, create the formation and then break apart at 5,500 feet. Two other judges reviewed photos of the jump later and confirmed Monday it was official.\nMost Read Stories Pair split; now can she divorce nickname?

After 50 people went out for a first jump there was time for a second one, so 11 more joined in.\nSkydive Perris was the site of another record earlier this month when 202 divers linked up to form the world’s largest sequential skydiving formation.\nWingsuit diving differs in that skydivers wear special suits with pressurized wings attached to their bodies, allowing them to glide horizontally while they fall at a slower rate than regular skydivers.\nJOHN ROGERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:35:32.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
