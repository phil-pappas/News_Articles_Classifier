He later scored on a two-out single by Logan Schafer, and Luis Sardinas -- called up at the same time as Ashley -- delivered an RBI hit later in the inning.\nIn a game that depleted both bullpens, former starting pitcher Kyle Lohse came on to pitch the bottom of the 13th for Milwaukee and record his second save. It was the seventh consecutive victory over the Pirates for the Brewers, who have not helped the playoff cause of their divisional foe one bit.\nThe Brewers took the lead in the top of the 12th on Ryan Braun's two-out, run-scoring single, their first run since the initial inning of the game. That left it to closer Francisco Rodriguez, who had blown only one of 35 save chances for the season.\nNo. 2 came quickly as Gregory Polanco led off the bottom of the inning with a home run to right, blasting a 2-1 changeup into the elevated seats. Rodriguez escaped further damage and the teams played on.\nThe Brewers scored three runs in the first inning but then went into a 10-inning offensive funk, failing to score while producing only five hits over that span. That drought gave the Pirates time to peck away at the lead, finally drawing even in the eighth on Andrew McCutchen's home run.\nPittsburgh veteran right-hander A.J. Burnett was making his first start since July 30, having missed nearly six weeks with an elbow issue. The Brewers gave him a rude welcome back by putting three runs on the board in the first.\nScooter Gennett led off with a double to right-center, moved to third on a grounder to second by Elian Herrera and scored when Braun did likewise.\nAdam Lind kept the inning going with a single to center, and Khris Davis followed with a booming home run far over the center-field wall. It was the 19th homer of the season for Davis, who got all of a 1-0 fastball from Burnett.\nBurnett settled in after Davis' homer and didn't allow another hit during his five-inning stint. He issued a couple of walks and struck out three before departing.\nBrewers starter Wily Peralta stranded a runner at second base in the third inning and used a double play to keep the Pirates off the board in the fourth. But he found bigger trouble in the fifth when Pedro Alvarez led off with a walk and Francisco Cervelli laced an opposite-field hit to right.\nBoth runners advanced on Jordy Mercer's fly to left, taking advantage of Davis' weak throwing arm. Neil Walker batted for Burnett and lifted a sacrifice fly to left to put the Pirates on the board and cut the lead to 3-1. Maldonado shut down that rally by picking Cervelli off second base to end the inning.\nThe Brewers blew an excellent scoring opportunity in the sixth inning after Herrera's single and Braun's double put runners on second and third with no outs. All Lind had to do was ground out into the Pirates' infield shift and Herrera would have scored with Braun moving to third but instead he struck out.\nDavis, a fly ball hitter, couldn't deliver one that would have scored Herrera. Instead, with the contact play on, he hit a grounder to third baseman Jung Ho Kang, who threw to the plate for an easy out.\nDavis stole second to put runners on second and third again but Domingo Santana took a curve ball for strike three and the scoring chance evaporated.\nPeralta found himself in a sticky situation in the bottom of the inning when Josh Harrison singled with one out, bringing McCutchen to the plate. With Harrison going on a 3-2 pitch, McCutchen struck out and Maldonado threw out the runner at second.\nKang led off the bottom of the seventh with a single off Peralta and moved to third on consecutive wild pitches. When Starling Marte drew a walk to put runners on the corners with no outs, the Brewers were in big trouble and Peralta was done.\nJeremy Jeffress took over and struck out Pedro Alvarez but walked Cervelli to load the bases. Pinch-hitter Aramis Ramirez went down swinging but pinch-hitter Travis Snider worked Jeffress for a walk that forced in a run and cut the Brewers' lead to 3-2.\nLefty Will Smith, who has had issues retiring left-handed hitters and suffered another rough outing Wednesday night in Miami, came on to face lefty-hitting Gregory Polanco. Smith whiffed him on a 1-2 fastball but the ball momentarily eluded Maldonado, who retrieved it to get the out at first and keep the Brewers on top.\nThe lead finally slipped away in the bottom of the eighth. With one down, McCutchen sent a curveball from Corey Knebel the other way and into the elevated stands in right for his 22nd home run of the season and a 3-3 tie.\nThe Brewers had a chance to break through in the 11th when Jason Rogers legged out an infield hit with two outs and Domingo Santana followed with a double but Jean Segura bounced into the third out. Earlier in that inning, Braun thought he had stolen second but the call was reversed on video replay.\nThe Pirates had their chance to win in the 11th slip away via some bad luck. With two down, Cervelli walked and Chris Stewart singled to right to leave runners on the corners.\nWith Pedro Florimon batting, reliever Cesar Jimenez uncorked what would have been a game-deciding wild pitch but the ball struck umpire Fieldin Culbreth's leg and stayed close enough to the plate for Cervelli to retreat to third base. Florimon then struck out.\n(c)2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\nVisit the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel at www.jsonline.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735870&h=Brewers+escape+Pirates+in+13+innings%2C+6%2D4", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735870&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735870"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:27:24.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
