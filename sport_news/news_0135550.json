The Quartet was formed in 2013 when the democratization process was endangered due to political assassinations and widespread social unrest. It paved path for an alternative, peaceful political process at a time when the country was on the brink of civil war, The Norwegian Nobel Committee said in a statement. The Quartet mediated peaceful dialogues between the citizens, the political parties and the authorities which helped to find solutions to many challenges in spite of the wide political and religious divides, The Guardian reported. The Arab spring was originated from Tunisia in 2010-11 when thousands of the citizens protested against the dictatorial regime of Ben Ali which later led to his ousting. With the Quartet winning the peace prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee hopes it to be an inspiration to all who are working for the peace and democracy in different parts of the world including the Middle East, the Committee added.(ANI)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:41:54.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
