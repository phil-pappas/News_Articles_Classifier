Steve Markle brought her onstage and asked her the biggest tip she'd ever received.\nShe said about $10.\nThat's when Markle told her the teaching at the church had been about generosity so the congregation had taken up an offering for the driver. She broke into tears.\nThe Columbus Dispatch reports that the congregation was wrapping up a sermon series on \"I was Broke. Now I'm Not.\" The church draws about 500 to 600 people each week.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:07:54.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
