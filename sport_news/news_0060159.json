Not enough to get him out here on the field. But he's moving in the right direction,'' Flood said following his team's practice session in preparation for an 8 p.m. clash with the top-ranked Buckeyes. \"Whether that means it'll be fast enough to get him on the field Saturday, we won't know that until later in the week.'' \nCarroo left Saturday's 55-52 win over Indiana with an ankle injury late in the third quarter and never returned, walking with a boot on his right foot after the game. While Carroo said he would \"definitely\" play against Ohio State, the senior wide receiver was listed as questionable on the injury report Flood released on Monday . \nHere's a look at some of the highlights from practice: \nLocation: Practice field F-3 \nDuration: 1 hour, 50 minutes \nPads: Helmets and shoulder pads \nWeather: 75, sunny. \nFirst word Kyle Flood's post-practice opening statement: \n\"Good two days work to start the week. I like how the team's moving around, I like the attention to detail, I like the energy at practice. I think all those things are good.\" Rutgers’ Kyle Flood looks ahead to Ohio State game Rutgers head coach Kyle Flood fields questions about their preparations for their Saturday game against Ohio State. (Video by Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nTake two A pair of notable comments from Flood \nOn whether there are moral victories in college football: \"We don't put our mind on any of those things. All we're trying to do is come out here on Saturday night and play to the best of our ability, to win the situations that we know ultimately create a 1-0 situation for us on Saturday. All our focus goes on the things like drive start, turnovers, explosive plays. There's no moral victories in major college football. It's not something we ever talk about.'' \nOn whether he plans to stick with the running back rotation or ride the hot hand: \"I'll let it play out as the game goes. We'll start the game the way we've been starting it. I believe that as great as those runs were, whichever running back we had in the game at the time would've been able to make them. I think we've seen that over the last season and a half. I think we've seen games where Paul James has been the dominant player, games where Josh Hicks has been the dominant player, games where Robert Martin has been the dominant player. So certainly if a guy seems to have a better feel you want to give him a few more touches. I think when we got to the fourth quarter last week we did that. But when we start the game they're going to get the opportunity to touch the ball.'' Three takeaways \nA trio of impressions from Flood, Dan Duggan and Keith Sargeant \n1. Flood: At the midway point of the season, five true freshmen have a role for Rutgers. Blessuan Austin is a starting cornerback, Jarius Adams is in line to start if Austin (listed as questionable this week) can't play versus Ohio State, Jon Bateky is in the defensive line rotation and Deonte Roberts and Trevor Morris are contributing to the special teams. \nFlood says he wouldn't hesitate to play others if he believes they will make his team better. \n\"Experience always helps,'' Flood said. \"The more experience you have, the less they play like freshmen. We've seen that with some of the guys who have played early. A guy like Jon Bateky, he's getting better every week. So he's had the advantage. \n\"But as we continue to go forward, if some of these other freshmen can get activated and have to play for us, there's going to be a little bit of a learning curve. You understand that any time you put a young guy in a game, there's going to be some things that happen that aren't going to be perfect. And you just have to keep coaching them through it. You're putting him in the game because ultimately you think he's going to make the team better.'' \nSargeant: On a third-and-1 with the scored deadlocked at 52-apiece with five minutes to play against Indiana on Saturday, Sebastian Joseph stepped up to make a crucial third-down stop. \nThe redshirt sophomore tackled Indiana running back Devine Redding three yards behind the line of scrimmage, forcing the Hoosiers to punt. The Scarlet Knights never relinquished the ball, marching 59 yards in 12 plays before Kyle Federico drilled the game-winning field goal with no time remaining. \nJoseph's tackle-for-loss wasn't lost on Flood, who called it \"an excellent play.'' \n\"It was a movement up front and he started out on the center and he actually came around the right guard, and then got into the backfield and made the play more importantly,'' Flood said. \"It's not just enough to get there and be disruptive. You want to get there and make the tackle. And it becomes a TFL in a crucial situation, a three-and-out that gets us the ball back.'' \nDan Duggan: It's a challenge for Rutgers' scout team offense to replicate explosive Ohio State playmakers J.T. Barrett and Braxton Miller. \n\"It's really hard,\" Flood said. \"We've got Chris Parker back there playing some quarterback. We've got some guys rolling through playing all those positions. But it's not easy to do. You're talking about two of the more dynamic players in all of college football. So to take guys on your team who aren't starting or playing a lot and to think you're going to be able to simulate it completely is hard.\" \nFourth down Additional notes from the day \n• Rutgers' game against Ohio State is officially a sellout, according to chief marketing officer Geoff Brown. \nTweet of the day Celebrate the huge comeback in person at the @KyleFloodRU Radio Show tomorrow night @QSLEdison at 7:30! pic.twitter.com/oLbIxK2Fpf \nKeith Sargeant may be reached at ksargeant@njadvancemedia.com .
