The Seahawks dominated from start to finish, staying in the NFC playoff hunt in the process.\nAdChoices But the shine from the victory is false. The win is fool's gold. Yes, the Seahawks won the game, but in doing so, they put the problems that have dogged them in recent weeks on display.\nBOX SCORE: SEAHAWKS 20, 49ERS 3\nAnd once again the team hammered home a message, even in victory.\nThe Seahawks' run of dominance in the NFC is in serious trouble.\nRight now, said 12th Man (and woman) is headed to the comments section to light me up—to point out the positives from the game.\nAnd there were some, outside the obvious fact that the Seahawks ended the night with more points than the 49ers.\nFor the first time in 2015, tailback Marshawn Lynch eclipsed the 100-yard mark, picking up 122 yards on 27 carries and finding the end zone for the second time this year.\nAs Eric Branch of the San Francisco Chronicle pointed out, hitting that benchmark against the NFC West rivals is becoming old hat for Beast Mode:\nMarshawn Lynch rushing yards in last 8 games vs. #49ers : 91, 104, 109, 72, 98, 111, 103, 107.\n— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) October 23, 2015 And Seattle's defense was absolutely dominant in limiting the 49ers to a pathetic 142 yards of total offense. The Legion of Boom forced 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to spend most of the night either flat on his back or running for his life.\nAs Michael David Smith of Pro Football Talk tweeted, defensive end Michael Bennett had himself quite a game:\nAn hour ago Michael Bennett was tied for 35th in the NFL with 3.0 sacks. Now he's tied for second with 5.5 sacks.\n— Michael David Smith (@MichaelDavSmith) October 23, 2015 Actually, make that 6.5 for the season and a career-best 3.5 on the night.\nQuarterback Russell Wilson also provided fans with a highlight-reel play, finding wide receiver Tyler Lockett for the rookie's first career receiving score on this 43-yard connection:\nOh. You want to see a pretty deep ball? Then you want to watch this 43-yard TD from @DangeRussWilson . #TNF #SEAvsSF https://t.co/pwbmPBiJ7e\n— NFL (@NFL) October 23, 2015 So what's the problem?\nWell, why don't you ask Wilson after he gets done soaking in the cold tub. Because he got pounded. Again.\nAs Jeff Dooley wrote for the Washington Post before the game, the Seahawks offensive line has been, well, what comes after abysmal in the metaphorical Rolodex?\nRight now, the Seahawks own the worst offensive line in the league. They are PFF’s third-worst run-blocking unit, and rank dead last in pass-protection. None of their five starters has earned a positive grade this season in either facet of the game, and Wilson has been under pressure more than any quarterback in the league. (To his credit, he’s our sixth-ranked quarterback despite getting little help up front.)\nAs John Boyle of the team's website reported, just over a week ago head coach Pete Carroll was lauding the progress the offensive line was making, even as the Seahawks were losing games:\nI really like the way we came off the football. I really felt like our style was where it’s supposed to be. You saw us attacking the line of scrimmage, and the stuff that we live by showed up and was successful, so we want to keep going, keep doing that so it’s important that we stay with it and keep growing.\nThe only movement the Seattle line managed against San Francisco was backward movement. The 49ers sacked Wilson five more times on the night. That makes 31 times this season Wilson has been taken down, the most in the National Football League (his 26 sacks taken were tops in the league before Thursday as well). He's on pace to be sacked a staggering 71 times in 2015.\nAnd Wilson incurred that damage from a 49ers team that entered the night 24th in the NFL in sacks.\nLet's put it this way:\nSeahawks offensive line pic.twitter.com/ehaY3yF8ET\n— kb18964 (@kb18964) October 23, 2015 It's that bad. And whether Wilson and the Seahawks want to admit it or not, the hits are getting to the young quarterback.\nWhether the 26-year-old Wilson is actually under duress (which is just about always) or just hearing footsteps, he's bailing sooner and sooner. Taking risks with the football. Forcing throws, including a pair of drive-killing interceptions against San Francisco:\nDangerous throw by DangeRuss. Kenneth Acker makes him pay. #SEAvsSF #TNF https://t.co/h6nHJTm6AS\n— NFL (@NFL) October 23, 2015 Against the woeful 49ers, it didn't cost them. Against the likes of the Green Bay Packers , Carolina Panthers or Cincinnati Bengals , it's going to get them beat.\nOh, wait. It already has.\nYes, there were positives Thursday night, chief among them the straw that stirs the Frappuccino that is the Seahawks offense:\nICYMI: Marshawn Lynch designed a Frappuccino (\"Beast Mode Frap”) for Starbucks. And it’s available starting today. https://t.co/jWkuRtl64t\n— Seattle Met Magazine (@SeattleMet) October 22, 2015 Gotta love Marshawn Lynch. He's having fun being him.\nBut the notion that this is some sort of springboard win, that this Seahawks team is set to go on a tear that will launch them into the playoffs and possibly to a third straight Super Bowl appearance, is at best wishful thinking and at worst nonsense.\nAccording to Curtis Crabtree of KJR, that's essentially the spin Carroll tried to put on the victory after the game:\nPete Carroll: \"It felt like a really normal Seahawk night tonight.\"\n— Curtis Crabtree (@Curtis_Crabtree) October 23, 2015 With an offensive line whose favorite blocking technique is the matador (OLE!)?\nNot a chance.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 5 NEXT SLIDE > Russell Wilson #3 of the Seattle Seahawks scrambles with the ball against the San Francisco 49ers during their NFL game at Levi's Stadium on October 22, 2015 in Santa Clara, California. © Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\nGary Davenport is an NFL analyst at Bleacher Report and a member of the Fantasy Sports Writers Association and the Pro Football Writers of America.
