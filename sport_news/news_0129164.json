The ball traveled so far that it not only cleared the centerfield wall, but it hit the Home Run Apple. \n— Anthony DiComo (@AnthonyDiComo) October 18, 2015 \nThe poor Apple is supposed to pop up when a Mets player hits one out of the park, not actually be the target of batting practice. While New York beat Chicago in Game 1, its Apple took a bit of a beating in its own right. \nSo on Sunday, ahead of Game 2, the Mets made a display of concern for its long-ball accessory, which is a newer, bigger version of the Apple that celebrated homers in Shea Stadium. \"X\" marks the spot. We pranked Travis d'Arnaud by putting a bandage on the apple where he hit his HR last night. pic.twitter.com/zD2Zcstj60 \n— New York Mets (@Mets) October 18, 2015 Ha! The #Mets just placed a \"bandage\" where Travis d'Arnaud hit the Home Run Apple last night. pic.twitter.com/mbVr3bQeh0 \n— Anthony DiComo (@AnthonyDiComo) October 18, 2015 \nOf course, the Mets would be delighted if d’Arnaud, or any of their other players, hit the Apple again on Sunday. If so, it might be the Cubs looking for some first aid on their way back to Chicago. Des writes for the Early Lead and the D.C.
