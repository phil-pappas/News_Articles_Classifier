And there's a reason for that. The Americans haven't lost in these matches since 1998, and the last four have not been particularly close.\nThey walk taller. They worry less.\nJordan Spieth has played in one of each in his short but already stellar career, and it was hard not to notice the contrast between the two cups.\n  \"It seems there is a bit of a difference in the two teams rooms in the Presidents Cup experience I've had and the Ryder Cup last year,\" Spieth said Wednesday. \"Almost like we put too much emphasis on the Ryder Cup instead of just freeing up to play our own game.\"\nRyder Cup practice rounds felt like dress rehearsals. Presidents Cup practice rounds feel like a Tuesday money game on tour.\n\"We feel like the favorites,\" Spieth said. \"We're walking around with cockiness in our step, and often that can bite you if you're not careful, but we're aware of that. But the point is, we're out there smiling because we believe whatever matchup we want to put together, we believe we can beat the other team.\"\nThe Americans, who have won the Ryder Cup only one time in the last 16 years, go after their sixth straight victory in the Presidents Cup when the matches get started Thursday at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea.\nAdam Scott, who has yet to play on a winning Presidents Cup team in six previous tries, and Hideki Matsuyama lead off the foursomes session against J.B. Holmes and Bubba Watson, two of the longest hitters in golf.\nSpieth and Dustin Johnson are in the anchor match against Marc Leishman and Danny Lee.\nA lively opening ceremony Wednesday night, which featured South Korean President Park Geun-hye and former President George W. Bush, began with great suspense when a secret box was carried onto the stage. It was carefully opened to reveal the shiny gold Presidents Cup trophy.\nBut there really hasn't been much suspense at all.\nThe last time it was close was in 2003 at South Africa when it ended in a tie after Ernie Els and Tiger Woods matched pars in three sudden-death playoff holes before it was too dark to continue. Jack Nicklaus was the captain that year, and he mentioned that Presidents Cup in a speech Wednesday night. Nicklaus referred to it as the greatest sporting event in which he had ever taken part.\n\"We have that opportunity again this week,\" Nicklaus said.\nThe Presidents Cup has lacked the rancor of the Ryder Cup, which is inevitable when it's a competition between two tours (PGA and Europe) instead of the Americans against an International team in which all but one player — Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand — is or will be a PGA Tour member.\n\"They're all Americans, they were just born in a different country,\" U.S. assistant captain Fred Couples said.\nThis is the first Presidents Cup without Woods since 1996 when he was a 20-year-old playing on sponsor exemptions to avoid going to Q-school. Els didn't qualify and didn't feel worthy of a pick, so he is out for the first time since 2005.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:07:59.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
