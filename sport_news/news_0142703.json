Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Hurricane Joaquin could impact Maryland's game plan against Michigan. \nThe rain from Hurricane Joaquin that’s expected for Maryland’s game against Michigan on Saturday is nothing new for coach Randy Edsall and the Terps. They’ve already experienced a weather delay in a loss to Bowling Green on Sept. 12. Quarterback Caleb Rowe led Maryland to a rain-soaked win over Virginia two years ago. Even Edsall’s Terps debut more four years ago against Miami was a dreary affair. Byrd Stadium didn’t even have turf then, either. \nBut the main difficulty from Joaquin, which has a variety of uncertain tracks and projections for its landfall, will probably come from a combination of the elements. And that’s what Edsall and his staff have been trying to get the Terps ready for. \n“If it’s just kind of a steady rain, I think you can combat that,” Edsall said. “The thing that makes is tough is if you have the rain and it looks like they’re calling for anything from 15 to 25 mph winds, so I think you get the wind, you get the rain and you get the cold, that could make it a little bit difficult to throw the football.” \nEdsall said he’d been keeping an eye on the weather all week long. With the game being moved from its expected 8 p.m. kickoff to noon , Edsall said the biggest change is a loss of some meeting time before the game. But the Terps have already played two noon games at home this season, so they know the routine and timing of things well. \nThe Terps have shown in the past that they will pass the ball in the rain. The top two passing performances of Edsall’s tenure came in the two aforementioned rainy contests, with Danny O’Brien throwing for 348 yards in a win over Miami and Rowe throwing for 332 yards in a one-point victory over Virginia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:36:30.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
