If the winner of tonight's Auburn (5-1) at Harlem (5-1) game were to stumble in the next two weeks, there is a decent possibility the NIC-10 football race would end in a five-way tie at 7-2. The only time the league champ has ever had two losses was when Jefferson, Boylan and Hononegah all finished 6-2 in 1984. \"That would be special, wouldn't it?\" Auburn coach Dan Appino said. \"It reminds me of 1985, my first year in the league.\" This isn't the same quality as 1985, where East tied for third in the league at 6-3 yet easily won the Class 5A state title, Hononegah, also 6-3, took second in Class 4A and league champ Jefferson reached the second round in 6A, then the state's largest class. But it's even more jumbled. Just when something looks like a given, things change overnight. Harlem's Brenton Shaw was averaging almost 200 yards rushing before Belvidere held thim to 53 yards on 20 carries. Auburn has had the league's best run defense all year — except when the Knights gave up 315 yards on the ground in their one loss, to Belvidere North. A year ago, Auburn held the Huskies to an average of 1.3 yards on 40 carries, even though the Knights lost 14-13. They could possible force the Huskies to become one-dimensional tonight and rely on quarterback Trent Willey. \"We'd like to be balanced, but if we have to rely on the pass game, we would,\" Harlem coach Jim Morrow said. \"We're ready to do both. The opportunity hasn't really come yet just to air it out. We haven't executed consistently enough where we could go pass heavy, but this might be a game where we have to rely on that. \"They have so much size and speed and (Alphonso) Lambert is a tackling machine. They have so much speed and athleticism on defense, as well as size up front. It's a tall order to run on Auburn. It's a lot like last year. We had trouble moving the ball against them last year, and they have a lot of the same guys back. We have our work cut out for us.\" The two NIC-10 leaders are in a rare place. Auburn hasn't won the NIC-10 in more than 50 years. Harlem has two titles in its history. The winner tonight will be the outright leader with two games to play. Auburn lost last year when the snap on a two-point try in the final seconds went over the quarterback's head. Three such snaps almost undid the Knights last week, and they've been a problem all year. \"You've seen our ball security issues; we don't take anything for granted,\" Appino said. \"We can't count on them beating themselves,\" Morrow said. \"We want to take advantage of any opportunities they want to give us, but we have to create opportunities for ourselves.\" Page 2 of 3 - Matt Trowbridge: 815-987-1383; mtrowbridge@rrstar.com ; @matttrowbridge Auburn at Harlem Season record: Auburn 5-1, Harlem 5-1 Last week: Auburn beat Hononegah 7-6; Harlem lost 21-14 to Belvidere Last meeting: Harlem 14, Auburn 13 Fast facts: Auburn is ranked No. 10 in Class 7A. ...
