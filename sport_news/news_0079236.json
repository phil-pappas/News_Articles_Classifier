Three plays later, senior Javion Harris kicked a 25-yard field goal to extend the lead to 17-0.\nAfter a three-and-out from Colts Neck, Schleifer fielded a punt at the Brick 44-yard line, cut across the field to left sideline and turned down field for a 56-yard punt return touchdown that put the Green Dragons up 24-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:07:49.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
