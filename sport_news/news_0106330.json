Harding credits only having to wait six months to fight at home again for the high turnout. \n“Right now our fight team is very solid,” he said. “We have a lot of individuals who are registered boxers with Manitoba Boxing. The 10 fighters on the card, they’re from Westman area but they’re calling Brandon their home club. It will be a great event. All the guys we were trying to get matched up we got matched up.” \nThe card, which begins at 7 p.m., is scheduled to have 14 fights in total, with nine of them featuring locals. Doors open at 6 p.m., and there will be a social after the final fight. \nThere was a long break between events in the Wheat City prior to April. Harding was focusing on his professional boxing career and went 30 months without putting on a card. \nHe feels he’s got his career off the ground and can spend more time trying to promote boxing in the community again, which includes this event. \nHe’s also planning a few more in the next 12 months. \n“If I had it my way, I’d do it every weekend,” he said. “I’m excited. I know we have all the guys ready and that’s all we can ask. Winning or losing is important but really it’s all about teaching these kids life lessons and preparations. \n“The more they put in, the more they’re going to get out. If people prepare properly, the truth always comes out in the ring and that’s a positive life lesson right there.” \nAlthough his boxers are stepping up and ready to fight more often at home, Harding is hoping for more support from the community. He picked today for the card so he didn’t have to go head-to-head with Wheat Kings or Brandon University Bobcats games, but tickets aren’t selling as well as he would like. \nHe’s hoping for a decent walkup crowd. \n“I’m hoping to get a really good turnout, but I know Brandon’s a very last-minute community,” Harding said. “We’re going to get a lot of walkups, definitely. \n“Right now, we have some really entertaining fighters down there. We’ll put on a great show and I have faith the community will come forth and support our club and these fighters.” \nRush seating tickets for the event are $15 each or it’s $250 for ringside tables of eight. Tickets may be purchased at the door or by calling Harding at 204-570-2634. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:07:24.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
