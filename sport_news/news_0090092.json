The Redgals answered so quickly that Stonington coach Jenna Tucchio didn’t even see it. “I didn’t even see it happen. I couldn’t even tell you how they scored,” Tucchio said. The game-tying goal sent a message: Killingly would not be a pushover in Stonington’s quest for a seventh straight ECC title. The Bears took everything the Redgals could throw at them, but emerged with a 2-1 win, staying unbeaten (10-0-3, 10-0-2), after Trinity Lennon scored the eventual game-winning goal midway through the second quarter, just seconds after the Redgals (10-2-2, 9-1-2) called a timeout. Lennon corralled a ball that was rolling and put it in the back of the box. It was the second meeting of the season between the two Class S semifinalists from a year ago, after a 1-1 tie in Killingly earlier in the season, and they have built a good rivalry over the last few years. “You look forward to these games,” Lennon said of the budding rivalry. “You know they’re the hard games but they’re the most rewarding wins. I feel like we play our best when we play them.” Said Killingly coach Souki Syharat: “It’s good for the conference and good for the sport of field hockey in this region to have two strong teams go at it.” Arruda got Stonington on the board with 13 minutes, 27 seconds left in the first half when Arruda put home a rebound. Almost exactly a minute later, Killingly’s Alyssa Rainey broke free and found Heather Vogt by the corner of the goal for the game-tying score. “As soon as (Stonington) scored, all my players had their heads down,” Rainey said. “I was like, ‘No guys, we have to pick it up and do this.’ The only way to stay in a fast-paced game like that is to answer right back.” Rainey had a couple of nice chances in the last 10 minutes, but Stonington’s Cameron Dreher was able to make two impressive saves to keep the lead. “I told the girls this was not going to be a one-goal game,” Tucchio said. “Do not expect them not to score. That’s hockey, that’s sports, points are scored and you have to answer back.” Page 2 of 2 - Stonington has won all but two ECC titles since 1985. “There’s a lot of pressure on these guys,” said Tucchio, whose team won the Class S state championship in 2013 and was runner-up in 2012. “Especially after the teams we’ve had the last few years. If it wasn’t expected before, it is now.” Killingly was held to just five shots on goal. “They have amazing placement,” Rainey said of the Bears. “They do a great job placing those girls where they need to be. We didn’t really have anywhere to go. It wasn’t because we weren’t cutting and it wasn’t because we weren’t where we needed to be. They make themselves big and they take up the space and know what to do.” After their Class S semifinal run last season and playing in some big games this season, the Redgals are getting used to playing in more stressful situations. “It helps you build experience,” Rainey said. “These circumstances are foreign to us but you do something one time and the second time you’re obviously going to be a little better.” By Owen Poole The Bulletin The Bulletin By Owen Poole The Bulletin Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 10:41 PM Updated at 10:46 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:22:12.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
