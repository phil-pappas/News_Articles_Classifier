There is one notable absence, world number one Serena Williams who ended her campaign after her bid for the calendar year grand slam was stopped in the semi-finals of the US Open. \nBut fortunately another top player, Maria Sharapova, is back after inuries kept her out since Wimbledon and she would face Agnieszka Radwanska in a red group match. Sharapova, serving in the far court, first picked up a foot injury but returned only to hurt her wrist which led to more time off. The drop shot is easily chased down and the Russian tries a lob but Radwanska counters with a backhand overhead for a winner.It's now set point for the Pole, and Sharapova is going to send this backhand well long as Radwanksa takes the frame 6-4.Maria turns it around in the second and now has set point herself. A booming forehand and her trademark screech seals it 6-3 for the lanky blonde.After fighting off multiple break chances early in the decider, Sharapova is now facing two more, but the quick lob saves another with the Russain leading 5-4. On match point, Sharapova hammers a forehand to the corner the Radwanksa can't handle and then shrugs suggesting she was not expecting the result in her first complete match back, but she will certainly take it, a three set win to start off the tournament. \nUS Open champion Flavia Pennetta from Italy in the near court taking on the top seed, Simona Halep of Romania in another red group match. The two exchange a series of cross-court backhands in a long rally until Halep picks out the corner with a sublime winner as she dominates the first set 6-0.Pennetta would get on the board in the second but can do little to slow down the diminuative Romanian who simply outplays her.We go to match point, as Halep, who later professed her confidence at this tournament, shows exactly why as the totally outclassed Italian finally sends a weak shot long as Halep brushes her aside while losing only three games.
