Source: News Corp Australia\n“It’s a different format, but you’ve seen players picked from one-day cricket for Test squads before so it does carry over,” Waugh said.\n“It’s a different game obviously, you’ve got to bat for long periods in Test cricket, one-day cricket the most you can bat is 50 overs, but I think just the form, you can see if guys are batting and bowling well.\n“If you’re not doing well it can count against you more so. You want to see all your players performing well.\n“There’s only one Shield match before the first Test, we get two days to look at the first Shield round and then we pick the squad for the first and second Tests.\n“You don’t have a lot of red-ball cricket, but there’s still a lot of cricket to be played, whether that’s better than going to Bangladesh in foreign conditions, whether that’s a better warm-up is questionable.\n“But players are playing a lot of cricket these days, they’re used to swapping and changing formats, so whilst it’s probably not ideal we didn’t play the two Tests in Bangladesh it gives as a chance for some players to freshen up.”\nDavid Warner and others will return to the Australia squad to face the Kiwis.

Source: News Corp Australia\n“The squad from Bangladesh, it’s going to look different for New Zealand, there is no doubt about it because you didn’t have [David] Warner, [Josh] Hazlewood and [Mitchell] Johnson, so there’s three players straight away you’d imagine would come back into the reckoning for the first Test.\n“And different conditions, you’re not going to have two spinners at The Gabba in the first Test.\n“There’s going to be some guys picked for that tour who are probably going to get shuffled back down the order a little bit, but you can’t do anything about it.\n“At least their names are there, they got picked for an Australian tour, they can take comfort from the fact they’re definitely in the reckoning, but the reality is it will be a different 12 for the first Test in Brisbane to what would have been picked in Bangladesh.”\n Picking Test squad on one-day form?
