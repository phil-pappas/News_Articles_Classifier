Pleasant Oct 05, 2015 \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nTIFFIN — The Mt. Pleasant football team held another first-half lead on Friday night in their district game at Clear Creek-Amana, but a 6-0 halftime lead wasn’t enough to hold off the Clippers, who scored the last 20 points of the ballgame, including two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, to get past the Panthers, 20-6. \nThe two offenses struggled early to get anything going. Mt. Pleasant played a balanced game offensively, while CCA came out with a run-heavy offense and only attempted five passes all game. \nAfter almost an entire half finished without any points, the Panthers punched in their only touchdown with 1:21 left in the second quarter. Pat Canby finished the drive with a four-yard touchdown run. Korte Maddy’s extra point was blocked, but the score put MPCHS in the lead, 6-0 at halftime. \nThe Clippers fought back in the third quarter, and Anthony Akers capped off a drive with a three-yard touchdown rush with 7:07 left in the quarter. CCA had the chance to go ahead, but their extra point was no good and the teams were tied 6-6 for the rest of the quarter. \nThe CCA rushing game was able to wear down the Mt. Pleasant defense in the fourth quarter. Akers continued to push the ball on the ground and scored on another short run, this time for two yards. This time, the kick was good, and the Clippers led 14-6. \nMt. Pleasant was unable to score on the next drive and needed to stop CCA to have another chance at tying the ballgame. The Clippers’ running game, however, was too strong down the stretch, and CCA pounded the ball to the end zone with a three-yard touchdown run by Jared Eckrich. The extra point made it 20-6, and MPCHS couldn’t cut the lead anymore. \nCanby led the team offensively with 113 yards rushing with one touchdown, and 39 yards receiving on two catches. Quarterback Joe Hess finished 13-24 with 126 yards and one interception. \nJack Davis caught two balls for 32 yards receiving. DShundric Foster had four catches for 18 yards. Zac Ebeling and Brady Sartorius caught two passes each for 16 and 12 yards respectively and Kieran Kohorst caught one pass for nine yards. \nThe Panthers fell to 0-6 overall this season and 0-3 in the district. They sit in sixth place and will need to win at least two of their last three games to sneak into fourth, which is the last playoff spot. \nMt. Pleasant will host Fairfield for homecoming this Friday. The Trojans are 3-3 overall and 2-1 in the district with a 23-0 loss to Washington, a 33-29 win at Ft. Madison and a 41-23 win over Keokuk last week at their homecoming game. \n3A D5 standings (overall record in parenthesis) \nT-1. Washington 3-0 (5-0) \nT-1. Davenport Assumption 3-0 (4-2) \n3.
