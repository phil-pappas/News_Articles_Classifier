Taylor Gray scored on a 1-yard touchdown plunge on 4th and goal with 3:45 left in the game. \n\"It's always a battle when we hook up,\" Cy-Fair head coach Ed Pustejovsky said. \"Both teams try to play physical football. We were fortunate to come out on top and our kids rose and played well there at the end.\" \nCy-Fair (4-1 overall, 4-0 in 17-6A play) will sit atop 17-6A after the week ends. \nPenalties and fumbles were as prevalent as touchdowns in this game for both teams but for even moreso for Cy Ridge. \nCy Ridge (3-2, 2-2) lost two of five fumbles with 14 penalties for 135 yards. Cy-Fair only lost one of two fumbles with six penalties for 44 yards. \nThe teams only traded a pair of field goals before half, but the fireworks started in the third quarter. \nCy Ridge quarterback Cody Canady found Kevin LeDee for 14 yards down to the Cy-Fair 4. Trelon Smith later reached the end zone for the night's first touchdown - a 4-yard score with 7:55 left in the third. \nAll Cy-Fair did was respond. Trent Kennedy set the stage with a 47-yard gain on the first play of the drive. \nFaced with a 4th and 10 from the Cy Ridge 27, Gray connected with B.J. Chambers for 22 yards. Kennedy finished the drive with a 1-yard score. \n\"We had some things going offensively and defensively we created a few things as well,\" Pustejovsky said. \"Left them in some long yardage situations. Like I said, I was proud of both sides of the ball.\" \nThe penalty problem reared its head again for Cy Ridge on the ensuing drive. \nBack-to-back false starts stunted the drive and a punt that would've pinned Cy-Fair at its own 3 was erased by a facemask call. \nCy Ridge still was opportunistic when it needed to be. \nCy-Fair gave up its lone turnover and Cy Ridge's D'Angelo Ellis recovered. But Cy Ridge was flagged for two unsportsmanlike penalities after the play that pushed the Rams back to their own 41. \nThe one penalty not against Cy Ridge on that next drive helped. Cy-Fair was flagged for holding that extended the Rams' effort. \nCy Ridge, however, later fumbled with Cy-Fair's Nelson recovering his first one. \nCy Ridge head coach Gary Thiebaud won't gripe over the bevy of penalties. \n\"We'll look at the video,\" he said. \"It is what it is. We never blame anything on officials. There's a bunch of plays out there that happened where there were no flags on the ground.\" \nCy-Fair was forced to punt after the first fumble recovery, but Nelson was in the right spot once again. \nHe recovered another Cy Ridge fumble at the Rams' 3. On 4th and goal, Gray punched in the winning score. \n\"We knew they were going to come out and be physical like they were,\" Gray said. \"Their defense played hard. Their offense is dangerous. I think our team did a good job.\" \nCy Ridge had another shot to tie the game late but a safety ended those hopes as the Bobcats then ran out the clock to win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:10:28.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
