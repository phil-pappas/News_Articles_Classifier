He came on the biggest stage in a big game against a good opponent.\" \nAfter injuries to the quarterbacks ahead of him, Jensen was asked to lead the offense for most of the second half. \nConway (3-4, 2-2) took its first lead when quarterback Breylin Smith scored on a 20-yard touchdown run that made it 35-34 with 8:12 left in the fourth quarter, but Alma answered as Jensen led a 71-yard scoring drive that he capped with a 3-yard touchdown that made it 40-35 with 4:26 left in the game. \nConway marched downfield on its last drive, but it failed to convert on fourth and 6 at the Airedales 16 with 2:27 left, allowing Alma to hang on for the victory. \n\"We had our chances and just couldn't get them off the field,\" Conway Coach Clint Ashcraft said. \"We just didn't make enough plays at certain times when needed. We didn't play well enough to win the game.\" \nAlma (5-2, 3-1) jumped out early and held a 28-10 halftime lead as quarterbacks Noah Dotson and Alex Beneux led the offense to touchdowns on four of the Airedales' first five possessions. \n\"We had some busted coverages and some dropped passes that helped us get in a big hole,\" Ashcraft said. \"We just weren't able to climb out of that in the second half. It was a team thing. Both sides were unproductive early. We made plays in the second half.\" \nConway forced three turnovers in the second half and turned all three into touchdown. The Wampus Cats also helped themselves on special teams in the second half when Marquise Pleasant returned a kickoff for a 100-yard touchdown to cut the lead to 34-23 with 4:59 left in the third quarter. \nAlma lost 27-24 last week to Bryant after missing a 26-yard field goal with 29 seconds left in the game, but the Airedales took advantage of a second chance to beat a Class 7A opponent Friday. \n\"We have been a part of these crazy games since we've moved to this conference,\" Loughridge said. \"We feel we came out on the wrong end last week and in the past. We hurt ourselves. But when it came down to the end, our guys made it happen.\" \nJensen finished with eight carries for 61 yards. Dotson completed 18 of 22 passes for 240 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Beneux had 19 carries for 89 yards with 2 touchdowns and 5-yard touchdown pass. \n\"We play him in junior varsity at quarterback and he is one of our best defensive players,\" Loughridge said of Jensen. \"He had to step up for us. A lot of sophomores would have panicked in that spot.\" \nRunning back Landon Brigance finished with 12 carries for 77 yards for Alma. Brayden Johnson added 5 catches for 117 yards with 1 touchdown, and Heath Friddle added 2 touchdown receptions and 33 yards on 4 receptions. \nSmith completed 13 for 32 passes for 202 yards with 1 touchdown for Conway. He also rushed for 88 yards and 1 touchdown on 8 carries. \nConway running back Mark Odom finished with 97 yards and 1 touchdown on 11 carries . McCall Dail added 1 touchdown and 40 yards on 9 carries. \nLITTLE ROCK CATHOLIC 31, SILOAM SPRINGS 21 \nSILOAM SPRINGS — Lance Harville-Thomas carried 25 times for 151 yards and 2 touchdowns to lead Little Rock Central (3-4, 2-2 7A/6A-Central) past Siloam Springs (4-3, 1-3). \nHarville-Thomas rushed for a 10-yard touchdown in the second quarter and hauled in a 16-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Andre Sale as Catholic built a 24-7 lead going into halftime. Sale also hit Justin Temple with two 31-yard touchdown passes. Sale completed 9 of 18 passes for 151 yards and 3 touchdowns as Catholic finished with 345 yards of offense. \nSiloam Springs quarterback Jordan Norberg hit Ricky Hughes with a 15-yard touchdown pass, and Hughes added another touchdown on a 5-yard run. \nRUSSELLVILLE 32, \nVAN BUREN 31 \nRUSSELLVILLE — The Cyclones scored on a two-point conversion in overtime to beat Van Buren (2-5, 0-4). Quarterback Cale Fulsom completed 20 of 36 for 215 yards and 3 touchdowns for the Cyclones, while Jackson Hickey ran for 81 yards on 12 carries. Caleb Stokes also ran for two touchdowns. \nVan Buren had the ball first in the overtime, and quarterback Jordan Barlow scored on a 10-yard scramble on third down as the Pointers took a 31-24 lead after the extra point. \nFulsom answered with a 10-yard touchdown toss, then connected with Hickey for the two-point conversion and the victory. \nSports on 10/17/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:08.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
