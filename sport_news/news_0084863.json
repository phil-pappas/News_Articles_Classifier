(Photo: Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Toronto Maple Leafs $50 million coach Mike Babcock must feel as if he is trying to win a NASCAR race driving a 2015 Ford Focus.\nNo matter how hard he pushes on the throttle he's not going to get this vehicle up to speed enough to win in the foreseeable future. Here's what you need to know about the rebuilding 0-2 Maple Leafs heading into tonight's home game against the Ottawa Senators:\nCritical players in Toronto's rebuild aren't here : The Maple Leafs have skillful youngsters Mitch Marner, William Nylander, Kasperi Kapanen and Connor Brown who could probably be playing now. But the Maple Leafs are opting to use the crock pot, not the microwave, in building this team. They are exercising patience when it comes to developing players.\nFan base accepts the pain : Toronto fans are passionate and vocal, but they are also among the most knowledgeable NHL fan bases. They understand the route to long-term success is to rebuild from the chassis up. After years of complaining about the team's lack of success, they are willingly supporting president Brendan Shanahan rebuilding efforts. Their attitude: it's about time we did this.\nBabcock is making a difference : While the Maple Leafs have been out-scored 7-1 in their first two games, it feels as if this team is playing with more pride than what we saw last season. The Leafs played a solid game in the opener against Montreal, and Babcock's return to Detroit on Friday had too many mitigating factors to be used for any meaningful analysis. But anyone familiar with Babcock knows that he will not accept anything less than this team's best.\nUSA TODAY\nMike Babcock returns to Detroit: Eight reasons Red Wings will be fine without him\nGoalies have something to prove : Babcock will put pressure Jonathan Bernier and James Reimer to perform at a high level. He historically doesn't have patience for sub-par goaltending. More importantly, he knows quality goaltending is the only way his team can stay competitive this season. Bernier is under contract this season and next season. If he wants to be in Babcock's master plan, he must play splendidly.\nEntering Auston Matthews Sweepstakes : Arizona native Matthews has scored six goals in his first seven games playing in the Swiss Elite League. Scouts view him the same way they viewed Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel last season. Matthews is the star every rebuilding team needs. However, NHL draft lottery rules have changed.\nStarting this season the last place NHL team is guaranteed only to pick no later than fourth overall. Lottery balls will be pulled for the first three picks. But the worst team still has a 20% chance of picking No. 1 overall. Toronto fans all know that. The Leafs lack scoring. They may not average two goals per game this season. Even Babcock can't spin yarn into gold when it comes to creating offense.\nPHOTOS: Best performances of October\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn October's NHL stars: Best performances of the month Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
