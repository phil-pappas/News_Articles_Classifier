When we get better, we’re not going to do that. That shows no class at all, in my mind. There’s no reason to do that.” Chester was Leonetti’s favorite target, as the two connected on four completions for 113 yards. Mac-Hi’s junior quarterback ended up completing 6 of 23 attempts for 142 yards and the touchdown, but Ontario intercepted three passes. The Pioneers tried alternating passes with runs, led by Manny Calvillo’s 44 yards on 16 carries, but they also turned the ball over on three fumbles. “You’ve got to keep looking at effort,” South said. “That’s all you can do. We’re a good (junior varsity) team playing a varsity schedule.” Ontario used the turnovers to mount a 42-0 lead before Mac-Hi finally got on the scoreboard moments before halftime. The Pioneers had started from their 28-yard line with less than three minutes left, and Calvillo soon brought fans to their feet by converting a fourth-down gamble. On the very next play, with the second quarter down to its final seconds, Leonetti hit Chester with a deep throw around the sideline at midfield. The junior wideout eluded his coverage and raced another 40 yards, crossing the goal line with three second left. Mac-Hi’s Danny Flores split the uprights for the extra point. “We started off slow, but once we got to the second quarter and we got some nice passes in, and they started to set in, we played good,” Leonetti said. “We worked as a team to make that push for the touchdown.” The Pioneers wrap up their season Friday at home against Baker.
