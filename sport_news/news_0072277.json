Catherine Muccigrosso cmuccigrosso@lakewyliepilot.com i Order Reprint of this Story LAKE WYLIE \nThe new Publix grocery store in Lake Wylie will open at 7 a.m. Nov. 11, company spokeswoman Kim Reynolds said Wednesday. \nIn keeping with the Veterans Day opening, shoppers with military or veteran ID, or a driver’s license with a veteran designation, will receive a 10 percent discount on groceries. \nThe 49,000-square-foot Publix will offer similar features to other stores nearby, including a full-service bakery, deli, and meat and seafood department. \nThe company held a three-day hiring session last month for 60 part-time openings in all departments. \nThe new store will be the fifth in York and Lancaster counties. \nThe opening comes two years after Publix announced it would open at The Landing Station plaza on S.C. 274 – the one-time home of a Bi-Lo and Winn-Dixie store. The old store was rebuilt and expanded. \nThe Lake Wylie store was one of the final openings planned when Publix announced 11 new Charlotte-area stores in 2013. Those plans have grown to 18 stores opening through 2017. \nPublix bought The Landing Station plaza from Rivercrest Realty in 2014, and demolition and construction of the new store began in January. \nConstruction of the Publix led to the relocation of several businesses in the shopping center, and months of limited parking access for the half-dozen remaining businesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:58:28.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
