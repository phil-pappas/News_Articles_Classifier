And with no obvious juggernauts heading into the 2015-16 season, Kentucky looks like one of the best teams in America yet again. \nIncredibly, Las Vegas was taking bets on another undefeated run this summer. \nCalipari was not. \n\"Last year's team was an anomaly,\" he said. \"That should be thrown out. Don't ever look at it, don't compare. If you tell me about that team, stop, just don't tell me, because that may never happen again.\" \nSophomore point guard Tyler Ulis hopes it doesn't. \nAs much fun as that ride was, he was inconsolable after UK came up two wins short of college basketball's first 40-0 season – and more notably to him, just shy of claiming the program's ninth national championship. In the losing locker room back in April, Ulis said that single smudge ruined the whole picture for him. \nTime supposedly heals all wounds. So all these months later, has he gained some perspective? \n\"Still feel that same way,\" Ulis said. \"I've thought back a little bit like, 'We still went 38-1,' but I still feel like it doesn't matter. Our goal was to win the national championship, not go 40-0. We wanted to do that, of course, but at the end of the day we wanted to win a national championship. \n\"It eats at me so much. I hate it. I still think about it almost every day, like, 'I can't believe we lost.'\" Buy Photo UK's Marcus Lee and Alex Poythress Michael Clevenger/The Courier-Journal (From left) UK's Isaiah Briscoe (13), Tyler Ulis (3), Skal Labissiere and Jamal Murray (23).

For Poythress, a 6-foot-8, 230-pound freak athlete who never expected to be in college two years, much less four, it's even more urgent. \nInconsistent play delayed his NBA dream through last year, and a torn ACL in December forced him to come back again, becoming the first Calipari recruit to stay four years at UK. The injury also cost Poythress a chance to help the Wildcats in their Final Four rematch with Wisconsin, a game he greatly impacted the year before. \nHe's experienced almost everything – a rare NIT appearance for the Cats his freshman year, an NCAA title game as a sophomore, major injury and an historic run his junior season – except cutting down the one net that matters most. \n\"It's going to drive me a lot,\" Poythress said. \"We were so close. So close two years ago, so close last year. So close you can taste it.\" \nThe veterans hope their fire and Calipari's annual infusion of fresh talent, which included five-star freshmen Skal Labissiere, Jamal Murray and Isaiah Briscoe, can propel UK to the only thing that will soothe the disappointment: banner No. 9. Q&A: Calipari breaks down 2015-16 Cats \nThis team won't be as deep and likely not as dominant, and a non-conference schedule that includes Duke, UCLA, Arizona State, Ohio State, Louisville and Kansas could deliver a few early speed bumps, but the blend of proven veterans and elite newcomers looks like a recipe with which the Cats' Hall of Fame coach can cook up a contender. \n\"He's up there right now just scheming,\" said Murray, pointing to Calipari's office overlooking Kentucky's practice gym. \"It's going to be interesting to see what he has for us.\" Buy Photo UK's Marcus Lee and Alex Poythress Michael Clevenger/The Courier-Journal (From left) UK's Isaiah Briscoe (13), Tyler Ulis (3), Skal Labissiere and Jamal Murray (23).

His stock skyrocketed this summer after he dominated against grown men and led the Canadian national team to its first medal at the Pan-Am Games. Now a projected NBA lottery pick, Murray was widely viewed as the missing piece in Calipari's fast-tracked rebuilding plan when he signed in late June. \n\"They needed one more guy,\" he says, shrugging off that distinction, \"but they have enough guys on this team to do something really special anyways. When you look around the room, and you just look at everybody individually, we have a lot of talent. We have so many weapons, everybody's so good, it's hard to point to one piece.\" \nSound familiar? There won't be enough for a repeat of the platoon system, but there are elite players at every position and in all shapes, sizes and skill sets. There's a trio of point guards – 5-9 Ulis, 6-3 bulldog Briscoe and Murray – which Calipari plans to play all together at times. \nThere's Poythress and the springy 6-9 Lee, plus 6-11 Labissiere (the possible top pick) and another late recruiting addition, 7-foot, 260-pound Australian freshman Isaac Humphries. Junior-college transfer Mychal Mulder (6-4) is a sharpshooter and top-100 freshman Charles Matthews (6-6) is a lockdown defender and high-flying finisher. Sullivan | Calipari, Brown: Apples & Oranges? \nThat's enough talent to leave homegrown juniors Dominique Hawkins and Derek Willis scratching for whatever's left of the playing time. Calipari won't force the issue on sharing minutes this time around. \n\"This isn't the eighth-grade league. I did what I did last year because I had no choice. Everybody deserved to play,\" Calipari said, but \"some of my best teams, I've played five guys, six guys. I mean, my best teams.\" \nLike the one that did what last season's remarkable team could not. His 2012 national champions had six guys play 26-plus minutes per game, and those Cats also won 38 games – just in a more satisfying order. Of course, those six guys all bolted for the NBA, and Kentucky nose-dived the next season. \nThese Cats hope to avoid a similar fate, but it does beg an interesting question: Why would anyone want to follow an act like that? \n\"I'm always up for a challenge,\" Murray said. \"It's great to see what they did last year, but we're trying to create our own story and hopefully win a championship. That's our goal. I don't see why this team can't go all the way.\" \nKyle Tucker can be reached at (502) 582-4361.
