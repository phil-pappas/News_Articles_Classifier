The Bronx school still led by 9 points to begin the fourth quarter but Fearless/Matrix was building momentum by the play as they began to more than match FDA's offensive output.Desinor (13 points) was a one-man wreck crew and eventually tied the game at 35 midway through the final stanza. Travis Cox briefly put FDA back in charge as the lead swayed back and forth in the final minute. It would be efforts by Shaquille Ricks (17 points) that would put Fearless/Matrix over the finish line by a nose.
