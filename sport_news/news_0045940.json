The defense has performed reasonably well at times, but only if it is not left on the field for exceedingly long periods. With the Giants in the no-huddle offense most of the time, if the offensive line does not block well, the Giants frequently give the ball back quickly, which again only amplifies the pressure on the defense.\nEli Manning has been effective leading the offense if given time to survey the field. If not, as was the case in the Giants’ loss to the Eagles last week, the offense fizzles. But for the first time Sunday against Dallas, the Giants’ young and revamped offensive line will be facing the Cowboys ’ two best defensive ends. Keeping them out of Manning’s face will be essential. If Hardy and Gregory can disrupt Manning’s rhythm, Dallas has a chance for an upset victory.\nNumbers to watch\n9 and 1\nNine is how many touchdowns Manning has thrown in his last four games against the Cowboys. He has thrown one interception.\nQuotation of the Week\n‘I wish I knew.’\nCoach TOM COUGHLIN , when asked where the Giants stood with defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul. Pierre-Paul has not signed a contract with the team, which retains his rights. Nor has he visited the Giants more than once since his Fourth of July fireworks accident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:11:46.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
