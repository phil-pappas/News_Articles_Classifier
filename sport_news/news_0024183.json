Seales stepped down at the end of the season after 40 years as Raiders’ head coach. Josh Russell was announced as his replacement recently. By Troy Hyde Newton Daily News \nNeil Seales thought the day would come when he no longer related to the athletes that he coached. \nHe even expected it to maybe come this past spring when a new crop of freshmen came into the program. \nIt just didn’t happen. \nSo he had to make a tough choice. And that choice was to step down as Collins-Maxwell/Baxter’s boys’ track coach after 40 seasons at the helm. \n“It was mixed emotions,” Seales said. “We had 50 kids out last year and I could have easily signed the contract and came back for another year. But I felt like the program maybe needed a change.” \nSeales said he made up his mind about three-fourths of the way through last season. But he kept it pretty quiet, not even telling his wife about his plans. It became official at Baxter’s June school board meeting. \nSeales wanted to leave the program in good hands. Josh Russell has those hands. He served as a Raiders’ assistant coach under Seales for the past 10 seasons and ran on Seales’ 4x800 relay team that won the state title in 1997. \n“It’s an honor to be the next CMB boys track coach,” Russell said. “We have a good base going right now. We are definitely not starting from scratch.” \nSeales admitted that he recommended Russell highly to CMB administrators. Russell embodies what program has been about since Seales took over. \n“He was a guy who embodied what we wanted our student-athletes to be,” Seales said. “He was an average athlete, and I have told him that many times. But he had the desire and the will to do it the right way. It was great to have him as an assistant. He’s a team guy and he brings everything we want our guys to have.” \nCMB’s teams under Seales had plenty of fantastic athletes and many state champions. But the philosophy behind the Raiders’ success involved a team-oriented approach where they pile up double points in several events to finish with team title after team title. \n“That’s our calling card,” Russell said. “That’s what I want to keep going when I take over. I like the team aspect.” \nRussell wasn’t surprised Seales decided to step down, but he also said his former head coach could have coached another 20 years. \n“Some people just connect with kids, and he had the ability to do that,” Russell said. “There is no one more driven than Coach Seales.” \nSeales coached football and track during his time at CMB. He retired as Baxter High School Superintendent a few years ago. He will continue to work as real estate agent at Baxter Realty. \nRussell also is the current Baxter Elementary Principal. After his high school career ended in 1998, he competed in the sport at Simpson College. \n“It will be important for me to continue to build relationships with the kids,” Russell said. “It will be important to continue developing our kids into men that we can be proud of.” \nRussell said he was offered the boys track coaching position two weeks ago. The hire will become official at Baxter’s monthly board meeting on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:26:25.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
