The Friday night assault is drawing comparisons with the horrific beating of a San Francisco Giants fan in 2011.\nBryan Stow suffered permanent brain damage from his beating at the hands of Dodgers fans Marvin Norwood and Louie Sanchez , who are both serving long prison sentences for the attack. Stow, a Northern California paramedic, sued Dodgers ownership and a civil jury awarded him $18 million in 2014.\n  bryan stow ,  crazed fans ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:27:56.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
