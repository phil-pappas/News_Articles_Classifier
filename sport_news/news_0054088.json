Making the trip on the ferry for the presentation were Lower Township Mayor Michael Beck and Lower Cape May Regional (NJ) Athletic Director Mark Schiffbauer. \nOn Sept. 12, the Cape Henlopen Vikings bested the Lower Cape May Regional Caper Tigers 41-8 in a varsity football game to claim the 2015 DRBA Commissioners Cup. The game took place at Steven Steger Field, the home of the Lower Cape May Regional Caper Tigers. Separated by the Delaware Bay and a short trip aboard the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, the schools renewed their football rivalry in 2010. The Cape Schools hadnâ€™t played in the regular season since the early 1980s. The host Caper Tigers beat the Vikings 25-3 in that first meeting while Cape Henlopen has won the last three clashes. The Vikings now lead the series, 3-1. The DRBA Commissioners Cup back in the possession of Cape Henlopen High School.
