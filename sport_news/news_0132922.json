Two doctors on the flight rendered immediate aid, and the pilot returned the plane to Shannon airport, where the iconic, red-headed right fielder is recovering in a hospital.\nHe told The Post he has “no recollection of anything” that happened on the flight.\n“When you wake up in a bed in a hospital, I guess it’s confusing,” he told The Post. “I’m doing fine, will probably have to stay another two or three days. I’ll be getting home to New York next week.”\nThe 71-year-old fan favorite — also a Cajun-influenced chef who owned a Midtown restaurant for years — played 23 seasons in the majors, including two stints with the Amazin’s, from 1972 to 1975, and from 1981 until his 1985 retirement.\n“The prognosis is good and Rusty and his family ask that we respect his privacy during this period. He is in the thoughts and prayers of the Mets organization,” the team said in a statement.\nHis friend, Stephen Marro, has launched a Go Fund Me campaign to raise $60,000 for a medical plane to get Staub home to Florida.\nStaub said he was unaware of the fundraiser but called Marro “one of my closest friends.”\nStaub also played for the Montreal Expos, where he was dubbed “Le Grand Orange.”\n  heart attacks ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:23:09.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
