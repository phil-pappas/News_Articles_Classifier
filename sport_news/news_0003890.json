And I feel like they’re supposed to protect the players, and I have a certain shoe that feels the best with my foot — I’ve had foot problems over the last two years.\"\nBy July 1 every year, each team must designate white or black as its dominant shoe color, according to the 412 words in the subsection devoted to shoes in the NFL's rulebook. The Bears' is white, but Bennett said the Air Jordan brand cleats that help his ailing feet come only in black.\n\"I black out the logo so I don’t get fined for wearing something that's not official or whatever, but they’re too black,\" he said. \"Maybe I’m going to have to paint them white.\"\nThe NFL fines first-time offenders for a uniform violation $5,787, and a second infraction triggers a fine of $11,576. Would Bennett be willing to pay that every week so he can wear his cleats?\n\"No, I've got a kid at home,\" he said. \"She's smart, too. I'm going to have to pay for Harvard or something. But, nah, I can't afford the fine every week. It's about my health, though.\"\nPrivacy Policy Martellus Bennett NFL Chicago Bears", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d3549/turbine/ct-martellus-bennett-pissed-nfl-fine-20150930"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:06:47.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
