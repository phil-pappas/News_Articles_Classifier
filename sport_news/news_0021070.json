Michigan State trailed by two points with 10 seconds left on the clock. All Michigan had to do was execute a punt and the game would be over. ESPN calculated the Spartans' odds of winning at 0.2 percent. \nWhat happened next was a play that will go down as one of the most memorable in Michigan State history to cap off a 27-23 win at Michigan Stadium on Saturday. \nThe snap Special teams had been a disaster for Michigan State to that point, with a fake punt that came up short, long returns allowed, and miscues on the team's own returns. \nBut Michigan State knew Wolverines punter Blake O'Neill was a rugby-style punter, meaning he had a longer than normal process between catching and punting. He had also bobbled a snap earlier in the game. \n\"We knew coming into this game we had a chance to block one,\" Michigan State freshman Grayson Miller, a member of the punt block team, said. \"We had a really good chance to block one.\" \nThe fact that there were 10 seconds on the clock also meant there was no reason to put a return man back. The 11-man punt block is rarely used, but Michigan State practices it three times per week for just such a scenario. \nAs the Wolverines snapped the ball, Miller took off running from the edge, head down. \nWhen he looked up, he saw that O'Neill running forward to pick up the ball, after a low snap had bounced off his hands. \nMiller veered left and got to O'Neill just saw he was turning with the ball in his right hand. The hit he and two others delivered jarred the bar from O'Neill's hands. \nWithout bouncing, the ball popped right into the hands of Jalen Watts-Jackson, a redshirt freshman defensive back who had never touched the ball in a college football game before. \nThe run When Watts-Jackson caught the ball, Mark Dantonio hoped he would go down quickly. \nThat would have been the sensible thing to do, anyway. Six seconds remained on the clock, and Watts-Jackson was on the 38-yard line. He could have run into field goal range and gone down, or gone down immediately and let the offense run a lateral play it had already devised on the sideline. \nBut Watts-Jackson didn't stop after he picked up the ball. He ran. And as he did, Dantonio looked up toward the clock. \n\"I saw the zeroes go up, I knew we had to score,\" Dantonio said. \nWhen Watts-Jackson gained possession, Michigan's Wayne Lyons was a yard in front of him, and two more Wolverines were within five yards. \nAs he streaked down the sideline, Spartans cornerback Jermaine Edmondson provided the key block, spinning Lyons out of the way until he was behind the play. \nAs Watts-Jackson neared the goal line, the two other Wolverines converged, but not until he was falling over the goal line in front of a stunned Michigan student section. \n\"All of a sudden, life gets flipped upside-down,\" Dantonio said. \"We come out on the top end of it.\" \nThe celebration As Watts-Jackson crossed the goal line, Safety Demetrious Cox ran from the sideline and jumped onto the growing pile of players in Michigan Stadium's north end zone. Then he flopped down onto the field by himself, still in a state of disbelief. \n\"I was like 'I can't believe it. I seriously can't believe it,'\" Cox said. \nThe most exciting single play any of the players on Michigan State's sideline had ever seen drew a range of reactions. \nConnor Cook ran toward his parents, jumping up the brick wall to celebrate with his crying family. Next to him, wide receiver Macgarrett Kings sat on the edge and cried, as fans gathered around him. \nByron Bullough, the seventh member of his extended family to play for the Spartans, cried at midfield. \n\"That family, it means a lot more to them than some people,\" Michigan State offensive lineman Brian Allen, Bullough's roommate, said. \"I was happy to see that.\" \nDantonio joined the stampede toward the end zone -- \"I was just sort of chasing everybody in white,\" he said -- before he got pulled away for interviews. But he got his chance to celebrate, when he danced in the locker room afterward. \nWatts-Jackson wasn't able to celebrate, at least not in the usual way. A cruel twist to the iconic play left him with a hip injury at the bottom of the pile, and headed to the hospital while his teammates celebrated. \nTeammates offered their thoughts and prayers afterward. But the pain from that injury will end long before the memories from those 10 seconds do. \n\"It just felt like in a dream,\" Cook said. \"Completely crazy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:19:17.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
