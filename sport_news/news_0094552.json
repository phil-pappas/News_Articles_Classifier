Gates will open two hours before kickoff, which is 30 minutes earlier than usual, and general parking will be available at 5 a.m.\nAs of Thursday morning, there were roughly 2,000 tickets remaining, according to deputy director of athletics Mark Alnutt, who added that the department had been selling close to 1,000 tickets per day.\n\"We could be close to a sellout,\" Alnutt said. \"Do we think it's going to sell out? We don't know. But it's going to be very, very close.\"\nThe official capacity of the Liberty Bowl is 59,308, according to the team's media guide.\nCrowds of that size can create operational challenges, before and after games. Alnutt said the university and city studied traffic habits from previous home games this season, most recently a nationally televised Thursday night contest against Cincinnati, and devised a plan to better direct traffic flow with assistance from the Memphis Police Department.\nBefore Saturday's game, general game-day parking will only be available at two access points: on Southern Avenue, near the Mid-South Coliseum, and on East Parkway, just south of Tiger Lane. Pedestrian traffic on South Hollywood Street will be funneled to the east side of the road to prevent congestion.\nAfter the game, some portions of adjacent streets will become one-way to minimize delays. South Hollywood Street, for example, will become a one-way northbound road north of the railroad tracks. Southbound traffic south of the railroad tracks will largely be funneled to Southern Avenue.\n\"Working with the city, we have a lot of ideas that we're going to put into action this game that hopefully help alleviate some of these pressures,\" Alnutt said. \"I'm not saying there's going to be zero issues at all, but we're just trying our best to be able to reduce them.\"\nAlnutt said that on Saturday, there will be more staffers at stadium gates and about 300 points of sale, which is nearly 100 more than the team's last home game. More vendors will be walking the steps of the Liberty Bowl, for example, and more points of sale will accept credit and debit cards.\n\"(It's) flow into the game, getting into the gates, getting to your seat, concessions, restrooms, when you exit the game,\" Alnutt said. \"Just (trying) to minimize those difficulties that people have been having.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:38:15.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
