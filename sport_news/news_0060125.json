Nothing less.\n\"I told the team before that final drive, 'If we break a long run, get a first down,' and for Johnny to then go down,\" Winiecki said.\nThen 21 Option was called, and Fisher found himself staring at nothing but open space and the end zone.\n\"A hole opened up and I ran through it and I clearly broke away and was going to score but around the 25-yard line, I decided to slow down because I already had the first down,\" Fisher said. \"I was running and debating because I knew I should go down and run out the clock and win the game for my team, so I kind of just slid.\"\nFisher admitted his slide wasn't highlight-worthy, but he already managed to grab the spotlight with his running.\nFootball recruiting notes: Marist QB Brendan Skalitzky right at home throwing to Liam Keffer Bob Narang Marist senior quarterback Brendan Skalitzky has made a habit of throwing passes that Liam Keffer can take to the house.\nThe Skalitzky-to-Keffer connection dates back to a very young age, when they grew up two houses away from each other.

Winiecki hopes Friday's breakout performance helps colleges realize that Fisher is a quality back deserving of more attention. Due to a win by forfeit in Week 1, the Warriors (3-2) have played only four games. Fisher has 100 carries for a team-high 713 yards and eight touchdowns this season.\n\"Barrington Wade gets all the press and deserves it, but Johnny was the best running back on the field Friday night,\" Winiecki said. \"Johnny is playing with a chip on his shoulder. He's not a surprise. He's a very good running back, and our offensive line is starting to come around.\"\nFisher said he attended camps at Princeton, Harvard, Dartmouth and Yale this summer. His grades are another positive: He scored a 34 on his ACT.\n\"My recruiting started off better, but now kind of like stopped,\" Fisher said. \"There hasn't been much progress. I was really interested in Dartmouth.

He never stops working. It made me want to have that same drive as him and my big brother, and how they go after it and compete. I try and do the same thing as they do with my team.\"\nLandon, a 6-1, 175-pounder, orally committed to Southern Illinois last week, but admitted he wants to leave the door open for other schools.

I was very comfortable down there and I really like the players.\n\"I'm still interested in Illinois State, Western Illinois, Illinois and Indiana. Those are the top schools I'm looking at right now.
