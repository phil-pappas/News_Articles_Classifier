And it turns out the orchestrated hysteria from some quarters about the trauma of testing and the evils of educational accountability were just that. Orchestrated hysteria.\nClasses continued in grades 3-12, and students and teachers now have a baseline to measure not only individual student progress, but student progress across state lines. Don’t our kids and their parents deserve to know how they stack up against students in other states when it comes to subject matter mastery and college readiness?\nIndeed they do, and this provides much-needed positive momentum.\nKatarina Sandoval, academic officer for Albuquerque Public Schools, says, “These results are very pleasing. I think that’s a testament to the hard work of our teachers, our principals and our students.”\nAnd Santa Fe Superintendent Joel Boyd points out PARCC sets “a new proficiency guideline” and if PARCC results don’t improve in the future, then and only “then we should be concerned. What it tells us is that we have work to do.”\nAbsolutely. But there are also extremely bright spots from the first round of PARCC results that deserve a minute in the spotlight:\n• Seventeen percent of high school math students are in classes so advanced, i.e. calculus and trigonometry, they were not tested by PARCC. That automatically skews the results down.\n• Eighth-graders who took the Algebra I, Algebra II and geometry PARCC tests rocked it, scoring better than their high school counterparts.\n• English students scored better as they advanced, with tenth-graders performing better than ninth-graders, and eleventh-graders performing best of all.\n• Some districts and schools turned in good to great performances – APS and Rio Rancho students outperformed the state average on all tests; close to 70 percent of Rio Rancho eleventh-graders scored career and college ready in English; and the vast majority of the students at the Albuquerque Institute of Math and Science state charter school scored college or career ready in math, English and science.\nWith the help and perseverance of dedicated teachers, it’s fair to say that many of New Mexico’s high school students showed right out of the gate they can rise to higher expectations, and mechanisms are in place to help the rest get there as well.\nEducation Secretary Hanna Skandera says the bottom line of switching to the Common Core curriculum and the PARCC exams that better align with it is “we want our students to be competitive, not just in New Mexico, but across this nation. It’s about raising expectations for our kids at every single grade level.”\nIt is important to note that despite the small in number but vocal PARCC doomsayers, most of the class of 2016 will not have to re-take the PARCC English or math exams to graduate; students who did not pass the tests can re-take them and, if they fail again, can still qualify for graduation more than 15 other ways; the tests will be streamlined next year with just one window and shorter testing times; and academic leaders in two of the state’s largest districts are already embracing the data to move students forward.\nAs results for students in grades 3-8 are released next week, and individual student reports are made available next month, it is essential to ignore the call to return to the soft bigotry of low expectations and instead focus on these types of successes and build on them.\nThis editorial first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal.
