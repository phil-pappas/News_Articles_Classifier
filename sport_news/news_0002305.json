The 29-year-old running back has battled injuries through the first seven games, but he put in easily his best performance of the season Thursday while rushing 27 times for 122 yards and a touchdown. According to ESPN Stats & Info, it was Lynch's 25th 100-yard rush game as a Seahawk. That's second behind only Shaun Alexander, who had 37. Lynch's first 100-yard game of the season was impressive, considering he spent a portion of the first quarter leaning over a trash can and puking with a towel draped over his head.

That was back in September, before the start of the regular season. The hope was Justin Britt's move from right tackle to left guard, inserting Garry Gilliam at right tackle and breaking in Drew Nowak at center would get better as the season progressed. That isn't happening, at least not in pass protection. Wilson was sacked five times by a mediocre San Francisco pass rush. At times, he held on to the ball too long. But there's no denying this ugly statistic: In seven games, Wilson's been sacked an NFL-high 31 times.

The oft-penalized, outspoken veteran was a force Thursday night on his way to 3.5 sacks, the second most by any player in the NFL this season. That moved Bennett's season total to 6.5 a year after he finished with seven. The rest of the Seahawks' defense was just as good, holding the 49ers to 142 yards and forcing more punts (nine) than first downs allowed (eight), but Bennett and defensive end mate Cliff Avril (1.5 sacks on Thursday) were particularly impressive.

However, it wasn't entirely smooth sailing for Wilson and the Seattle offense. The Seattle signal-caller threw two interceptions on the night, both on ill-advised throws to receivers that were far from open. Wilson has now already been picked off five times this season after throwing just seven all of last season. Fortunately for Seattle, it didn't end up affecting the outcome of Thursday's game, thanks in large part to a vintage, shutdown performance from the defense. However, if Wilson's turnover-prone ways continue, it won't bode well for Seattle as they try and regain the form that eluded them during the team's 2-4 start.

Photo-8837011.119205   6 The 49ers are the worst team in the NFC West The Thursday night victory was certainly a much-needed step in the right direction for Seattle after the rough start, but the excitement should be at least somewhat tempered considering the shortcomings of the opponent. San Francisco's Colin Kaepernick-led offense was utterly listless on Thursday, generating just 142 total yards on the evening. Kaepernick was particularly ineffective, going 13-24 for 124 yards. Yes, the Seahawks defense is a difficult matchup for any team, particularly one that experienced as much turnover as San Francisco did this offseason. But Thursday's game was still indicative of precisely how far the 49ers have fallen since the Jim Harbaugh glory days when they were a perennial NFC contender. San Francisco is now clearly a tier below its NFC West competition, which includes the 2-3 St. Louis Rams and the first-place Arizona Cardinals (4-2). Seattle did what they needed to do on Thursday, but they'll have to do the same thing against much tougher competition if they want to proclaim themselves fully resurrected into the Seahawks of old.

But with Thursday night's victory, Seattle finds itself squarely back in the mix in the NFC West. The division-leading Cardinals still have a Monday Night matchup with the Baltimore Ravens to try and pad their cushion, but either way the Seahawks have nine more games to close the gap and make a run at a division title -- plenty of time to make their move. If Seattle can manage to bag another road victory over the Tony Romo-less Dallas Cowboys next week and even their record at 4-4, they'll be in decent shape headed into their bye week before playing host to the Cardinals in Week 10. Seattle and Arizona also meet in both team's regular season finale in Week 17 on January 3, a matchup that could very well decide which team takes home the NFC West title this season.
