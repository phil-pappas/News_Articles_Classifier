She was diagnosed just after her first birthday. \nKellenberger began dreaming of completing a 5k this past summer and quickly decided that being unable to use her legs was not an excuse to fulfill her dream. \nThat led Kellenberger to the starting line for the Flavor Run on Oct. 3, 2015 at the Hoover Metropolitan Stadium. \n\"I was nervous and anxious before the race,\" she said. \"I just wanted to be able to finish strong.\" \nWith the help of a college friend, Kellenberger finished strong and completed her first race. She began training earlier this summer at the Lakeshore Foundation, a facility in Homewood designed to enable people with disabilities to live healthy lifestyles. \nKellenberger folled through the finish line after 46 minutes of pushing herself around the Hoover Met course. Kellenberger pushed herself over half of the way and a college friend ran with her the rest of the course. \n\"My disability is the single best thing that tests me continually and reminds me daily that I need Jesus,\" Kellenberger wrote in a recent blog post. \"I need him because he knows me better than I know myself. He allows my pain, not because he doesn't care, but because he knows it is temporary.\" \nShe said she expressed feeling a great amount of joy after finishing the race and knows that it will be only the first of many races in her lifetime. \nKellenberger encourages others to not hold back with excuses. She said she believes that sometimes the most uncomfortable things bring the most joy, and wants to see more disabled people see the reward of well-deserved finish line. \n\"I don't see myself as being disabled, but rather enabled differently to further the kingdom of God,\" she said. \n-- Contributed by Kara Young, Samford senior", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:16:10.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
