(AP) - Kentucky guard Dominique Hawkins will miss four weeks after breaking his right hand in practice over the weekend. \nThe junior will have surgery Tuesday to repair a broken bone in the hand and is expected to return in early November. A defensive specialist who provides energy off the bench, Hawkins has played in 56 career games. \nCoach John Calipari expects the Richmond, Kentucky, native to be in his rotation this season and said Monday he felt bad for Hawkins’ injury, adding in a release, “He was so much more confident, so much more skilled. … Now he’s got to get back and stay in shape.” \nKentucky opens the season Nov. 13 against Albany. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:45:37.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
