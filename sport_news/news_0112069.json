Family spokesman Bob Gunnell also stressed that Ali wants to show his support for coach Rick Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich.\n\"That is very important to Muhammad and his family,\" Gunnell said.\nAli, 73, received the Grawemeyer Spirit Award from Louisville last month for helping inspire others, and he occasionally attends Cardinals football games. His son Assad played baseball at Louisville.\nThe school, and more specifically Pitino, has come under fire after an escort alleged that a former men's basketball staffer paid for prostitutes to strip and have sex with recruits and players at an on-campus dormitory. Pitino has denied any knowledge of the parties, but the NCAA, University of Louisville police and the school are all investigating the allegations made in the book \"Breaking Cardinal Rules\" by Katina Powell.\nEarlier this week, five players confirmed to Outside the Lines that the women did come to strip and that some had sex with the players and recruits, all paid for by former director of basketball operations Andre McGee.\nPitino told ESPN.com and Yahoo! Sports that McGee is the only person who knows the truth and that \"he needs to come out and tell the truth to his teammates, to the University of Louisville, to his fans and to his coaches.\"\nIn a blog post Thursday, the Hall of Fame coach wrote that he would not resign.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments \"\nMuhammad Ali calls to unite Louisville, backs Rick Pitino \"\nMonster Hurricane Patricia Makes Landfall in Mexico \"\nHoneymooners Stranded as Hurricane Patricia Hits Mexico \"\nTrump Slams Carson as 'Super Low Energy' \"\nRoyals Return to World Series, Beat Blue Jays in ALCS Game 6 \"\nTwins Denied Learner Permits for Being Too Much Alike \"\nTiny Preemie Kept Warm With Plastic Bag After Birth \"\nRoad Rage Killing Shows Broken System, Albuquerque Officials Say \"\nSee Bystanders React to a Child Being Bullied \"\nA Look at Deadly Category 5 Hurricanes That Made Landfall \"\nWhy Did Hurricane Patricia Become a Monster So Quickly? \"\nTexas to Get More Heavy Rain, Heightened Flood Threat Colorado Theater Shooter James Holmes Assaulted in Prison \"\nAuthorities: 1 Killed, 3 Wounded in Tennessee State Shooting \"\nSoldier Killed in Iraq Raid Belonged to Delta Force \"\nFBI to Help Investigate Fatal Police Shooting of Florida Man Feds Fine San Francisco Zoo Over Death of Young Gorilla \"\nPhiladelphia 76ers Throw Shade at John Kasich After Insult \"\nHundreds at Candlelight Vigil for Swedish School Stabbings \"\n43 Killed in Fiery Bus-Truck Collision in French Wine Region Fire Destroys Historic Synagogue in New Jersey \"\nAhmed Mohamed Gets His Clock Back \"\nKaty Perry Isn't Only Musician in Iowa This Weekend for Campaign \"\nFeds Seize Lethal-Injection Drugs Imported by Texas, Arizona \"\nK-9 Dog’s ‘Last Call’ Captured in Heart-Wrenching Video \"\nArk.
