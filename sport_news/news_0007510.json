(AP) - Miami has lost leading tackler Raphael Kirby for the remainder of the season with a right knee injury. \nThe senior linebacker and captain was injured in the Hurricanes’ 30-20 win over Virginia Tech on Saturday. He is the third Miami linebacker lost this season, joining Darrion Owens (knee) and Marques Gayot (neck) and leaving the Hurricanes extremely thin at that position. \nHurricanes coach Al Golden says Kirby’s “commitment to our team and our goals has been unquestioned over his career and he will be sorely missed.” \nKirby had a team-best 44 tackles this season for Miami, and had made 19 consecutive starts going back to the beginning of the 2014 season. He was also a preseason candidate for the Butkus Award, which will be given to the nation’s top linebacker. \nThe Hurricanes (4-2, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) play host to No. 6 Clemson (6-0, 3-0) this Saturday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:35:08.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
