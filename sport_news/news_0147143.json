The Crusaders lost their edge in the first half. \nIn the fourth quarter, they found it. \nFor the third straight week, the Delsea High School football team found itself in a fourth-quarter hole. And like they’ve done in the past, the Crusaders found a way to get it out of it. \nAfter surrendering 27 unanswered points, they rose from the dead. \nDelsea rallied with three touchdowns in less than eight minutes – capped by Taj Summiel’s 24-yard TD run with 1:24 left and Brad Dobzanski’s fifth PAT kick – to escape with a 35-34 victory over Paul VI in a West Jersey Football League interdivision game Saturday. \n“I’m just trying to get the touchdown. I’m reading the blocks,” said Summiel, who got an outstanding block from left tackle Mark Chaney on his way to the end zone. “We’re tough. We’re not going to lay down and let you beat us.” \n“Every kid can hurt you,” Paul VI coach John Doherty said. “At halftime, our kids knew there was going to be a battle in the second half. We just couldn’t do enough. \n“They don’t quit. They were down to Camden and Timber Creek late and came back. I was seeing visions of that.” \nDelsea (4-0), No. 1 in the Courier-Post Mean 15, needed just seven plays to take a 14-0 lead less than seven minutes into the game. But that’s when the wheels started to come off as No. 7 Paul VI (3-1) would build a 24-14 halftime lead. \n“We scored twice and I’ve seen it happen before. … We let down. We lost that edge, that killer instinct,” Delsea coach Sal Marchese said. \nMatt Vitale (13-of-26, 284 yards, three TDs) hit Lonnie Moore on touchdown passes of 12 and 19 yards. Vitale would add a 1-yard keeper for a score, while Anthony Moran hit a 24-yard field goal with 24 seconds left. \n“The mistakes we made … We shouldn’t have had to make a comeback,” said Delsea senior quarterback Quinn Collins, who rushed for 185 yards and touchdowns of 59, 14 and 11 yards. \nMoran added a 25-yard field goal midway through the third quarter and the host Eagles owned a 13-point lead. At that point, it looked like an upset was in the works and South Jersey would have its fourth No. 1 team of the season. \n“We were up 14-0 and there was no reason why we should have been in a battle,” Chaney said. \nBut following an interception by Summiel with 3:19 left in the third, the Crusaders began to get their edge back. \nThey would march 95 yards on 14 plays, with Collins scoring his third TD of the game to cut the deficit to 27-21. \nPaul VI would temporarily regain momentum when Vitale hit Stefone Moore-Green on a 61-yard TD strike, only to see Delsea put together a 12-play, 60-yard scoring drive. Rashaad Williams capped the series with a 1-yard TD run. \nAnd after forcing Paul VI to punt on the ensuing possession, Collins would direct a quick, 4-play, 80-yard drive to complete the comeback. The Crusaders got a 10-yard run from Charles Walker, a 20-yard run from Chris Bascomb and a surprising 26-yard pass from Collins to Bascomb to set up Summiel’s dramatic TD. \n“It’s tough to defend everything they can do, so you kind of pick your poison,” Doherty said. \nSix different players carried the ball as Delsea rushed for 393 yards on 64 carries. \nSaid Marchese: “They work extremely hard and showed a lot of heart. They are never going to quit, and I’m proud of them for that.” \nKevin Minnick; (856) 486-2424; kminnick@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1LaL2Q6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:13:26.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
