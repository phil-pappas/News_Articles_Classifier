More from KOTA Territory Chiefs RB Charles out with knee injury \nQuarterback Andy Dalton passed for 331 yards and two touchdowns and tight end Tyler Eifert had eight catches for 90 yards and two TDs helping Cincinnati improve to 5-0 for the first time since 1988, when they last reached the Super Bowl. \nStarting in place of injured Marshawn Lynch, rookie Thomas Rawls rushed for 169 yards and a touchdown for Seattle (2-3), which for three quarters on Sunday looked more like a two-time Super Bowl participant. \nQuarterback Russell Wilson was sacked four times and picked off once while passing for 213 yards and a touchdown. Several mistakes seemed destined to haunt Cincinnati. In the first half, the Bengals had a 72-yard TD catch by receiver A.J. Green negated by a holding penalty and Dalton threw an interception with his team in field goal range. \nRunning back Rex Burkhead's third-quarter fumble was returned 23 yards for a touchdown by linebacker Bobby Wagner to put Seattle ahead 24-7 in the fourth quarter, \nIt was a seemingly insurmountable deficit against a Seattle defense allowing only 17.8 points per game. \nBut Dalton orchestrated a rally. He tossed a 10-yard TD pass to Eifert then engineered a methodical five-minute, 49-second drive capped by his five-yard TD run to make the score 24-21 with 3:38 left. With no timeouts remaining, Cincinnati regained possession at its own 18 with 2:17 left and drove for a game-tying 31-yard field goal by Nugent on the final play of regulation. \nThe Seahawks allowed one touchdown over 20 possessions before the Bengals marched 84 yards on their first possession and scored on a 14-yard TD pass from Dalton to Eifert. \nThe drive was highlighted by a 44-yard pass to Marvin Jones, the longest gain of the season against Seattle. The anticipated low-scoring game didn't materialize until later. But Wilson's 30-yard TD pass receiver Jermaine Kearse capped an 80-yard drive and tied the score 7-7 with 6:32 left first quarter. It was the second first-quarter TD this season for Seattle. Seattle's first interception of the season came late in the first half when free safety Earl Thomas picked off a Dalton pass intended for Green deep in Cincinnati territory. S \nteven Hauschka put Seattle ahead 10-7 at halftime with a 24-yard field goal on the final play of the half. It was the first time this season Cincinnati has trailed at the half. Rawls shook off several would-be tacklers during a 69-yard TD run putting Seattle ahead 17-7 with 8:38 left in the third quarter. \nNOTES: It was the second 100-yard rushing game for Thomas Rawls who had 104 yards in Seattle's 26-0 win over Chicago on Sept. 27. … Seahawks RB Marshawn Lynch missed his second straight game with a hamstring strain. Prior to missing last week's game against Detroit, Lynch had played in 60 consecutive regular-season games. … Rookie RB Thomas Rawls started in Lynch's place and his 169 yards. … To add some depth at running back, the Seahawks signed Rod Smith off their practice squad. … Bengals DT Wallace Gilberry played despite being questionable with a calf injury.
