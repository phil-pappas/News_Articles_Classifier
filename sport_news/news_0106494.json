By Aaron Portzline The Columbus Dispatch • Friday October 23, 2015 5:18 AM \nST. PAUL, Minn. — Upon his hiring, coach John Tortorella stressed that the Blue Jackets’ reclamation project wouldn’t happen overnight. \nBig ships, run horribly off-course, need a wide berth to turn around. On Thursday night in Tortorella’s debut, the Blue Jackets lost 3-2 to the Minnesota Wild before 18,650 at the Xcel Energy Center. \n“There were a lot of good things that went on with our club here,” Tortorella said. “We played hard. We won battles. We played the way I think we’re going to have to play to get us out of this. \n“But we’re 0-8. Moral victories aren’t going to help us right now.” \n>> Sign up for our free, daily newsletter on the Blue Jackets, get a chance to win tickets! \nThe loss dropped the Blue Jackets to 0-8-0 and gave them their own dubious category in the NHL record book. They have the longest regulation losing streak to start a season in NHL modern-era history and the longest streak since the 1943-44 New York Rangers — their roster decimated by World War II — lost 11 straight. \nThe Jackets couldn’t hold a 2-1 lead after the first period on goals from Alexander Wennberg and Brandon Dubinsky. Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky had 20 saves. \n“It’s hard when the result is the same,” Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno said. “We need a bounce right now. We need to get that confidence. You create your own luck playing like we did. There are still areas we have to clean up, but it was a good game to start getting the confidence back.” \nBefore the game, Tortorella said that, beyond the score, he was looking for the Blue Jackets to rediscover their swagger. \n“I want us to play with arrogance,” he said. “I don’t want us testing the water. I want to see some signs that we feel good about ourselves. That’ll turn into a good performance if that stays consistent.” \nMostly, the Blue Jackets did that. But a sloppy stretch in the second period — keyed by a double-minor penalty to Jackets defenseman Cody Goloubef — caused them to fritter away their lead. The Jackets, however, kept their shifts short, played with a physical presence and put together their most competent 60 minutes. \n“I’m not down about it,” Tortorella said. “We’re 0-8, we need to find a way to get a win, but I thought we took a step in the right direction to get us out of this.” \nThe Wild took a 1-0 lead 5:04 into the game when defenseman Ryan Suter jumped on a Jack Johnson turnover and fed Zach Parise for a goal in the crease. \nThe Blue Jackets responded at 10:16 on Wennberg’s first goal of the season. He chased after a rebound from a Goloubef shot, gathered it in the left circle and snapped off a shot that eluded Wild goaltender Devan Dubnyk. \nThe Jackets went ahead with a power-play goal with 21 seconds remaining in the first. Dubinsky scored into an open net after Cam Atkinson redirected a pass across the goal mouth. \nThe Wild pushed back in the second. Nino Neiderreiter jumped on a big, looping rebound by Bobrovsky, shooting from the mid-slot through the goalie’s pads at 5:41. At 11:12, the Wild took a 3-2 lead on Thomas Vanek’s goal on a power play. \nThere were early signs that life for the Blue Jackets will be different under Tortorella. \n“I like the fact that if he sees somebody going and playing well, he’s going to keep sending them out,” Atkinson said. \nIt works the other way, too. \nAt the start of the third period, No. 1 center Ryan Johansen was pulled off his line with wings Brandon Saad and Nick Foligno. By the end of the game — for the final 6:10 — Johansen didn’t play. \n“With Joey in the middle of that line, I didn’t think it was that effective,” Tortorella said. “I tried to stay with it during the game, so we switched the centers. When Dubinsky went and played there, I thought it was much more effective as far as getting pucks to the net and spending more time in the end zone.” \nDubinsky played 21:22, his most minutes this season. Johansen played 13:57, nearly five minutes below his season average. \nThe Blue Jackets pulled Bobrovsky with 1:26 to play but couldn’t tie the score. \naportzline@dispatch.com Wild 3, Blue Jackets 2 Columbus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:15:58.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
