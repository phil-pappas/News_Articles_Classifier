Ask the experts! \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. — If it hasn’t been the most entertaining way to spend the first 2 1/2 months of the season, monitoring the quarterback derby between Cardale Jones and J.T. Barrett has at least given Ohio State fans something to do while waiting for Michigan State.\nWhen the world puts the first 10 games on the schedule in the win column before a snap is made, everybody has to find a way to stay engaged. You can try to celebrate seven-point wins over Northern Illinois and Indiana, but it’s not easy. Worrying about why the offense hasn’t been humming the way it did at the end of last season — and debating which quarterback is or isn’t the answer — just feels like a better use of your time.\nUnder those parameters, Ohio State’s 49-7 win over Rutgers was a milestone game. For the first time this season, J.T. Barrett started at quarterback. It’s not like Jones hasn’t been a productive QB — the Buckeyes were 7-0 — but with Jones back there the high-powered OSU offense sometimes seemed like a Ferrari in need of a tune-up.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nRecent evidence pointed to Barrett as the answer, and Saturday night’s game seemed to confirm it.\nBarrett was 14 of 18 passing for 223 yards and three touchdowns and carried the ball 13 times for 101 yards and two TDs.\n“J.T. is a great leader, a great player, and he made those around him better today,” coach Urban Meyer said.\nBarrett had failed to impress when he replaced Jones and played the final three quarters against Northern Illinois in the third week of the season. But OSU’s struggles when it got close to the goal line opened an opportunity for Barrett two weeks ago, when Meyer decided to make him the red-zone quarterback and take advantage of his skills as a runner. The team responded by going 12 of 12 in those situations the past two weeks with 11 touchdowns.\n“Just sheer production” is how Meyer initially explained the move to Barrett, although it seemed clear to everyone Barrett’s explosive runs helped make OSU offense more efficient. And in fact, it took two offensive plays on Saturday night to offer proof he should be starting.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards \nThe third-year sophomore took the second snap in an empty backfield and rocketed 39 yards down the left sideline on a quarterback keeper, precisely the kind of lightning bolt Meyer sought when he moved Barrett ahead of Jones this week.\nWhen Barrett went 11 yards around the right end two plays later, you could almost see the nods of approval from Buckeye Nation. Then on a third-and-2 scramble from the 20, Barrett ran into his own teammate, receiver Michael Thomas, and fumbled.\nWhat? For a few fleeting moments, the belief that Barrett would make everything right with the Ohio State offense seemed like false bravado. But it was the last time anyone felt that way.\nIn part because of Barrett completions of 11 yards to Ezekiel Elliott and 20 yards to Thomas, the Buckeyes scored easily on their next possession. And after a three-and-out, they scored on two long, four-play drives the next two times they had the ball to go up 21-0 at halftime.\nFrom there, it was all downhill. They led 42-0 by the end of the third quarter, a bit of a surprise given that the Scarlet Knights had beaten Indiana 55-52 the week before.\nWhen the rout reached 49-0, Meyer summoned Jones for mop-up duty with 12:46 to go. The Ohio State coach said he feels some peace of mind entering the bye week knowing that he has the quarterback position settled.\n“I don’t want to admit it, but it does,” he said.\nThat would seem to answer all of the questions everybody had been asking. But when the opposing defense is ranked 104th in the nation and is especially bad against the pass — 124th in passing yards allowed out of 127 teams — it’s not always easy to assess the success.\nIt’s not easy to let go of this. The Buckeyes still have games against Minnesota and Illinois before the real schedule begins on Nov. 21 against the Spartans.\nUntil then, everybody has to do something.\nBob Hunter is a sports columnist for The Dispatch. \nbhunter@dispatch.com \n@dailyhunter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:17:55.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
