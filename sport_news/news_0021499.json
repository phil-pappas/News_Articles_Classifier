One snap. One play. \nAs Jim Harbaugh says: \"Welcome to football.\" \nOnto this week's grades. \nQUARTERBACKS: C- If you're going to beat a really good defense, you have to be able to make plays. And, for the most part, Jake Rudock just couldn't do it Saturday night. He over-shot a wide open Jehu Chesson on a 2nd and 9 in the fourth quarter that should've been a 79-yard touchdown pass that put the game on ice. In the quarter, he under threw a wide open Amara Darboh on another play that should've been a touchdown. Darboh adjusted and made the catch, but still, it should've been more. That's not timing or not understanding the playbook. Those are just poor throws. \nThere should've been more. That's the theme. He's leaving yards on the field and leaving points on the field. You can get away with that sometimes. You can't get away with it against a top 10 team. He didn't turn it over, but he didn't make plays either. Rudock finished 15 of 25 for 168 yards, 28 of them coming on a \"pass\" that was basically a forward handoff to Jabrill Peppers. He's the best quarterback on the team, and Harbaugh has to roll with him. Again, the situation isn't ideal. But when your coaching staff is drawing up three to five plays every game that pop wide open down field, you've got to hit on at least one or two of them. All of this aside, he was still 10 seconds away from a win. But there should've been more. \nRUNNING BACKS: C Credit Michigan State's defensive front for taking away the run (33 carries, 62 yards -- though -15 comes from Blake O'Neill's dropped snap), as there didn't seem to be much room up front at all. De'Veon Smith was the only player who had anything close to success, rushing 19 times for 46 yards. Sione Houma gets the 27 yarder on the fullback trap. And no one else really contributes anything. \nDrake Johnson did play, but didn't receive any carries. Freshman Karan Higdon saw more playing time, and had a big hole in the fourth quarter that could've been a chunk play, but he fell down. Derrick Green didn't receive a single touch, and Ty Isaac only had 2 carries for five yards. Not much opportunity for these guys, but no one really stood out with individual effort either. \nWIDE RECEIVERS/TIGHT ENDS: B- These guys did what they could, I think, for the most part. Chesson dropped a ball in the second half, but also got himself open more than enough times. Darboh, too. He made two really nice adjustments down the field on iffy throws to create positive plays. A.J. Williams made a nice catch in the first half that setup points, and continues to strive forward. \nMSU did a nice job of taking Jake Butt out of the game, though, as he has just 1 catch for 4 yards. Again, guys got open enough. Chesson's the fastest guy on the team, he out-runs MSU's corner in the fourth quarter and sets Michigan up for a game-ending play ... but he doesn't have a jet pack on his back. There's only so much he can do there. \nOFFENSIVE LINE: C Not good enough. Take out the minus-15 on O'Neill's play, and Michigan ends with 77 yards on 32 carries. Again, not good enough. This group had done a better job this season at limiting tackles for loss and negative plays, but allowed nine TFL on Saturday after giving up eight a week ago. Rudock was sacked three times, and hurried twice more. \nBut the real letdown for these guys comes on the final offensive possession. Michigan's defense plays its heart out to get the ball back and basically drive the final nail 9/10 of the way into the coffin. All the offensive line has to do at that point is find a way to gain 10 yards. One first down. Get one first down and the game's over. Couldn't do it. This is a veteran group, and they'll take ownership of that. They'll also bounce back, because if anyone knows about adversity, it's these guys. Expect a better performance out of this unit in two weeks at Minnesota. \nDEFENSIVE LINE: A They did enough to win the football game. Willie Henry did enough to win the football game on the final drive of the game, when he sacked Connor Cook twice and forced the Spartans into a long-yardage situation. Chris Wormley also had a sack, and Michigan's front four won the line of scrimmage battle all game long. From start to stop. MSU rushed 33 times for 58 yards. Its longest run of the day was L.J. Scott's 11-yard touchdown run, a play where the official misses a hold on Royce Jenkins-Stone right on the edge. \nMichigan's rushing defense still hasn't allowed a 100-yard rusher all season, and it's only allowed more than 100 yards once (opener vs. Utah). An outstanding unit with emerging stars. Henry suddenly has six sacks through seven games, and is just playing dominant football. He's not alone up here either. \nLINEBACKERS: A Michigan had to play most of the first half without two starters due to a targeting penalty, and the entire second half without its defensive captain Joe Bolden. But it really didn't matter, as Desmond Morgan held down the fort with help from Ben Gedeon and Allen Gant. \nMichigan State got nothing over the middle, nothing inside. Nothing. The rush defense was outstanding, and again, was more than good enough to win a football game. Also, for those who have asked, Bolden will be back for a full four quarters against Minnesota. He was only forced to miss the second half due to the targeting penalty. \nSECONDARY: B- Jourdan Lewis and Aaron Burbridge put on a 1-on-1 exhibition that you might want to go back and watch again. Cook threw at Burbridge 19 times ... 19. Lewis covered him all game. Burbridge made some fantastic plays, racking up 9 catches for 132 yards. But Lewis also registered six (SIX) pass breakups in this game. He had eight coming into the game on the season, and was in the top 10 nationally in that category. He now leads everyone. Both of these guys are All-Americans, no question about it. \nThat said, there were some issues Cook was able to exploit. His 74-yard pass to fullback Trevon Pendleton completely changed the game, and looked like a botched coverage where Delano Hill just missed the back coming out of the backfield. Jeremy Clark was also victimized by Macgarrett Kings Jr. on Cook's first-half touchdown. Cook threw for 328 yards, but he had to earn it. He was 18 of 39 on the day. \nSPECIAL TEAMS: A ... until the final play This is what makes this game even more weird. For 59:50, Michigan had itself in position to win a football game solely because of its specialty units. The offense was basically non-existent, and Jabrill Peppers' return game was just about all Michigan had going for itself. Peppers finished with 130 return yards on the day, and might've set a Michigan record (unofficially, I'm guessing) for most time on the field. What an effort from him. Kenny Allen was perfect on field goals (3-for-3) in a high pressure environment. \nAnd then there's O'Neill, who was absolutely outstanding throughout the entire game until the final snap. O'Neill had an 80-yard punt in this game. He put three of his seven kicks inside the 20, two inside the 10. He was a huge reason why Michigan was in position to win the football game. And then, suddenly, he's a huge reason why Michigan lost a football game. The team's punt formation on the final play was a bit of a mystery to me, as I'm not sure why there were two gunners out wide with 10 MSU defenders on the line. But either way, all O'Neill has to do is catch it and kick it. He bobbles it, and then panic ensues. O'Neill's played American football for just two years, and instinct just didn't kick in. A brutal mistake that turned what should've been the finest hour of his career into the worst moment of his athletic life. \nI've had a lot of people ask me if I agree or disagree with Harbaugh's decision to punt in that situation, on 4th and 2 at the MSU 47 with 10 seconds left. You can make the argument that it's only two yards, and even if you don't get it, it's a hail mary for MSU. But still, I'd have done the same thing he did. Snap it to the guy who punted like an All-American for 59 minutes and let him finish the game for you. O'Neill was one of the best offensive weapons Michigan had all day. You just can't write/predict an ending like that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:46:36.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
