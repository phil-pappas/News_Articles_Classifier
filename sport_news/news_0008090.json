According to ESPN.com, Philadelphia native Chaim Bloom, currently in the Tampa Bay Rays' front office, is one of the three candidates who could succeed Ruben Amaro Jr. as the next general manager.\nAlthough MacPhail has done an admirable job of conducting his search in secrecy, it would not be surprising if one of the other finalists is the name most often floated in reports since Amaro was fired last month: Los Angeles Angels assistant GM Matt Klentak.\nKlentak, 35, has been the closest thing to a favorite mostly because of his history with MacPhail. The Dartmouth grad was hired by MacPhail to be the Baltimore Orioles' director of baseball operations in 2008. Klentak was a candidate for the Angels GM job, which went to Billy Eppler earlier this month.\nMore coverage Final season stats for Phillies Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone!

The Yale grad has worked in the Rays' front office for a decade and is currently their vice president of baseball operations.\nKansas City Royals assistant GM J.J. Picollo, a Cherry Hill native, was labeled a \"heavy favorite\" earlier this week by USA Today. But, on Friday, ESPN.com reported that Picollo was no longer in the running.\nOther potential candidates whose names have surfaced are Dan Kantrovitz (Oakland), Thad Levine (Texas), Kim Ng (commissioner's office), Matt Slater (St. Louis), Ross Atkins (Cleveland) and Ben Cherington (formerly of Boston). Kantrovitz, who went in for a second interview recently, according to foxsports.com, is an intriguing candidate: He spent the last year as an assistant GM in Oakland after succeeding current Houston GM Jeff Luhnow as the St. Louis Cardinals' director of amateur scouting.\nMacPhail and company probably would like to have their hire in place by early next week: The Phillies' annual organizational meetings begin Monday in Clearwater, Fla. Baseball's general manager meetings begin on Nov. 9 in Boca Raton, Fla.\nThere's a fairly high probability the Phillies could make their hire Monday: The World Series begins Tuesday, and Major League Baseball is not a fan of teams making major announcements or news during the sport's most signature of events.", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/mlb/teamstats.asp?team=22&type=stats", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FMLB_Philadelphia_Phillies"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:53:23.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
