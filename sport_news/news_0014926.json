Show Caption Previous Next \nTennessee began its two-day swimming and diving road trip with a sweep of the Missouri Tigers on Thursday at the Mizzou Aquatic Center in Columbia, Mo. \nThe UT men beat Missouri 176-124 while the women won 164-136. Both Tennessee teams improved to 2-0. \nThe Vols hopped on a plane shortly after the meet. The team competes at Virginia on Friday with diving scheduled for noon and swimming at 3 p.m. \nVersatile sophomore Sam McHugh led the way for the Vols by winning three events, the 200-yard freestyle (1 minute, 38.76 seconds), the 200 butterfly (1:47.78) and the 200 IM (1:49.29). His endurance and recovery was tested early, getting only about an eight-minute break between his freestyle and butterfly wins. \nThe Tennessee men and women trailed early to start the meet after both teams narrowly lost the 200 medley relays, races the teams rarely lose in dual meets. The loss did not derail the Vols. Both teams rebounded to win the next three races. \n\"I knew it would be a test for us, and we didn't seem rattled at all,\" Tennessee coach Matt Kredich said in a school release. \"In the next two or three events, we were pretty outstanding.\" \nThe Tennessee women won nine of 16 events, pulling away from Missouri thanks to roster depth. The Vols had two 1-2-3 finishes during the meet (50-yard freestyle and 100 butterfly) and took the top four spots in the 500 freestyle, won by Madeline Tegner. \nTegner won both the 500 freestyle (4:54.21) and 1,000 freestyle (10:03.07). On the shorter end of the freestyle events, senior Faith Johnson won the 50 freestyle (22.81) and the 100 freestyle (50.39). \n\"We had a lot of people step up for the women, but what impressed me most was our depth,\" Kredich said. \"We have a lot of depth in a lot of events. They're pushing each other in practice and in meets. They were challenged today by Missouri and by each other.\" \nMen's Tennis: Four Tennessee men's tennis players won two matches apiece to advance to the third round of the USTA/ITA Ohio Valley Regional Championships at Tennessee's Goodfriend Tennis Center. \nJunior Jack Schipanski and sophomores Igor Smelyanski, Luis Valero and Preston Touliatos all moved on to the round of 32 on their home court. \nAll four of Tennessee's doubles teams also won to reach the second round. \nTwo rounds of main draw doubles and one round of singles will be played Friday. Admission is free. \nSophomore Jess Jones and freshman Marshall Sullivan lost second-round matches. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
