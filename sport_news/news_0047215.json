Well put together. Highly efficient. Largely unstoppable.\nNorth Jersey’s highest scoring team was at it again Friday night, churning out 38 unanswered first-half points en route to a 38-14 victory over Indian Hills in Big North National Division action.\nThe win gives the Golden Knights (5-0), No. 1 in The Record public football Top 20, sole possession of first place in the National Division. The loss snapped an eight-game winning streak for the No. 12 Braves (4-1).\nSo, what’s the secret to this offense, which is averaging 47.4 points per game?\n“We have experienced kids in the skill positions,” said NV/Old Tappan coach Brian Dunn. “Our line has come a long way, and we have a lot of different places we could go with the ball.”\nThe game was delayed 65 minutes because of lightning, but the delay didn’t seem to bother the Golden Knights. Senior defensive back Jordan Fuller recovered a fumble on Indian Hills’ third play from scrimmage and, four plays later, senior quarterback Kevin Martinez scored on a two-yard run to make it 7-0.\n“That’s a high tempo team, and you want to dominate from the start,” Martinez said. “We never gave them a chance to get comfortable.”\nFuller scored on an 80-yard run and Martinez threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to senior tight end Jedh Downey, and it was 21-0 after the first quarter. Martinez threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to Joseph Alsharif, and Zach DeNike scored on a three-yard run to make it 35-0 in the second quarter.\nSenior kicker Yanni Mitropoulos added a 33-yard field goal to round out the first half scoring.\nSo, can anyone stop this offensive machine?\n“Sure they can,” Fuller said. “But if we keep blocking the way we do, and we keep clicking on all cylinders, it’s going to be extremely difficult.”\nAnd while the offense gets all the attention, the NV/Old Tappan defense has been pretty special in its own right. The Golden Knights did a nice job corralling Indian Hills senior Tim O’Brien, one of North Jersey’s most productive quarterbacks, sacking him four times and picking off two passes.\n“We’ve only been playing one half every week,” said senior defensive lineman John Piccinich. “The first team defense has only given up 28 points, all against Ramapo.”\nFuller had a typical day at the office, carrying three times for 122 yards, catching a pass for 15 yards and picking up an interception. Martinez completed 10 of 13 passes for 128 yards and two touchdowns, and DeNike carried 11 times for 104 yards.\nO’Brien threw for 202 yards and a fourth quarter touchdown and also scored on a two-yard run.\nAnd now comes the moment of truth for the Golden Knights. They face No. 2 Pascack Valley, a team that beat them twice last season, next week in a game that could go a long way toward defining the season for both teams.\n“That’s a pride game for both of us,” Piccinich said. “They are not in our [state bracket] anymore, so this is the last time we’ll ever play them. It’s payback for last year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:36:05.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
