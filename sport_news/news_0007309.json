UH defender Sarah Lau had tied it up at 2 with her second goal of the game, and the season, in the 79th minute.\nGonzales struck back with her second goal of the game, keeping the Rainbow Wahine (3-13-1, 0-7 Big West) without a result in league play.\nLau, a freshman, scored in the fifth minute off a UH corner kick. It was UH's first lead of the Big West season, but it was short lived as the 49ers (10-5-3, 5-2) scored in the 29th and 33rd minutes.\nThe Wahine's last chance at a conference win is against UC Irvine on Thursday's senior night.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:44:59.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
