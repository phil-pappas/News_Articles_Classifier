And both times, Marco Estrada has pitched like an ace.\nEstrada doesn’t have the megawatt star power and the future $200 million bank account of David Price or the electric personality and medical-marvel narrative of Marcus Stroman. Nor does he have the Cy Young and knuckleball of R.A. Dickey or the career resume of Mark Buehrle.\nWhat he does have are the two season-saving wins of the Jays’ season.\nIn Game Three of the division series in Texas, with his team in a 2-0 hole, Estrada pitched 6∑ innings to start Toronto’s climb back to three straight wins and its first postseason series victory since the 1993 World Series. The Jays were in a similar spot Wednesday in Rogers Centre, in a 3-1 funk and coming off an humiliating 14-2 loss to the Kansas City Royals. And Estrada was just about unhittable.\nHe went 7 2/3 innings and gave up only three hits in a dominating performance that sparked a 7-1 Toronto win. The Blue Jays thus get the American League Championship Series back to Kansas City, where Price and Stroman await the Royals on Friday and Saturday.\nEstrada got the first two men in the eighth before giving up an opposite-field home run to Salvador Perez and a single to Alex Gordon. Manager John Gibbons ascended the dugout steps to go to his bullpen and the crowd of 49,325 didn’t wait to salute its hero of the night. Before Gibbons even got to the mound, the fans were roaring and waving their white towels.\nAs Estrada left and walked back to the third-base dugout, the noise was deafening. Back on the mound, his infielders were standing and applauding as well.\n“I can’t say enough about this guy, he was obviously special tonight,” said shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, whose three-run double in the sixth broke the game open. “It’s the start we needed.”\nEstrada’s adrenlin was still pumping but he said he was able to step back and appreciate the moment.\n“I put my head down, walked out and just tried to take it all in, how loud the stadium got,” Estrada said. “It was an incredible feeling walking off the mound seeing all the support this team has gotten the entire year, not just today. But it was extremely loud and it was a great feeling.”\n“That outing was spectacular,” said first baseman Chris Colabello, whose solo homer in the second gave Estrada the only run he would need. “You can’t ask for more than that.”\nThrough 6∏ innings, Estrada pitched to the minimum 20 batters, with the only Royal to reach base coming on Alcides Escobar’s fourth-inning single. That was quickly erased on Ben Zobrist’s double-play ball.\nWant some perspective on that dominance? It was the deepest any American League starter has gone into a postseason game pitching to the minimum number of hitters since Don Larsen’s perfect game for the Yankees in 1956. Wow.\nEstrada, 32, spent the last five years toiling in anonymity on the fringes of Milwaukee’s rotation, never winning more than seven games in a season. This has been the right-hander’s breakout year after the Jays got him in a deal for first baseman/DH Adam Lind. Estrada went 13-8 in the regular season and, counting the postseason, has thrown 200∑ innings for the Blue Jays this year.\nToronto got the worst start in its postseason history from Dickey in Game Four. Estrada gave them perhaps its best one in Game Five.\nEstrada’s fastball command was impeccable. In and out, up and down. Pitching gets so overanalyzed at times but it’s often pretty simple. You command your fastball and you can work to your offspeed stuff, like Estrada’s crushing changeup. He struck out five, walked one and had no one on base past first until the Perez home run.\n“The first game I couldn’t locate that down and away pitch,” Estrada said of his fastball. “Today I threw a lot of good ones. Changeup and curveball were there, threw a few good cutters. But the key for sure was being able to locate that fastball.\n“He used all of his pitches, throws strikes with all of them,” said Dioner Navarro, who has become Estrada’s personal catcher. “People have the misunderstanding of him as fastball-changeup guy but he’s got his curveball and cutter and he did a magnificent job for us. We’re really happy about it. We knew we needed a big outing from him and he did more than we could ask for.”\nAnd who was this against? The Royals were batting .331 and had 33 runs in the first four games. They had back-to-back 15-hit games, something that had never happened since the ALCS began in 1969.\nAs he did after the game Wednesday, Estrada continues to deflect questions about his future. He was an interesting mid-level free agent through the regular season but his price has gone up big-time in October.\n“Tonight was his night,” Gibbons said. “Everything he threw up there was right where he wanted it.”\nThere some interesting food for thought in the wake of Game Five. The series continues to be the exact opposite of the 1985 affair between the teams, with all five games mimicking the first matchup. Thirty years ago, Danny Jackson pitched a Game Five shutout for the Royals to pull them within 3-2 going on the road to old Exhibition Stadium a couple miles up the road here. Estrada was in the Jackson role Wednesday to get the Blue Jays back to Kansas City.\nThe Royals are just the third team to post 33 runs over the first four games of an LCS. All three teams built 3-1 leads. The previous two lost. The roll call: The 2003 Cubs who Bartmaned away the NLCS to Florida and the 2004 Yankees who dropped four straight to the Red Sox.\nThe Royals insist they’re OK with how things are going. The ‘85 Blue Jays felt the same way. Now we found out if Estrada was the catalyst for another comeback or just delayed the Royals’ coronation for another game.\nemail: mharrington@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:32:16.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
