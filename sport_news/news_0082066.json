And yet, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao might jump back into the ring for a rematch.\nIn an interview with Agence France Presse on Thursday, Pacquiao gave the clearest indication yet that he’s trying to fight Mayweather one last time before calling it quits. Pacquiao reportedly said he “is in negotiations” with Mayweather and second choice Amir Khan in hopes of setting up a fight for next May.\nFew would be surprised to see this rematch actually happen. Sure, Mayweather is officially retired , but he’s never been one to turn down a paycheck. And could you imagine the paycheck for a fight billed as the last for the two greatest boxers of the 21st century?\nIt would be enormous, as would fan interest. What’s less clear is if the fight would be any good. The first time around, Mayweather and Pacquiao put on a methodical display that had fans falling asleep into their guac. But don't get confused: Big-time fights aren’t about entertainment value anymore, they’re about making a few people a lot of money. There’s no question that a Mayweather/Pacquiao rematch would do that — which is why you should count on it happening.", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pacquiao-says-talks-mayweather-khan-151559263--box.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:39:29.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
