It really brings back a lot of trauma for everybody who has been attacked by a shark,” she said.\nThe real deal: Mick Fanning was attacked by a shark in July during a surf competition. Source: News Corp Australia\n“Some families have had fatalities and some people are still absolutely scarred without limbs. It’s disrespectful to them and Mick is not at all happy with that.\n“Their (World Surf League) lawyers were getting in touch with KFC to get it off [the air].\n“The comment that Mick made [was] that it’s disrespectful to anyone who has been attacked by a shark and he wants it off as well. We’re very upset about it.”\nAfter emerging from the water in July with just a scratch on one hand, Fanning told awaiting media he felt lucky to be alive.\n“I literally just jumped away and it just kept coming at my board and I was kicking and swimming,” Fanning said.\n“I just saw fin — I didn’t see the teeth, I was waiting for some teeth to come at me as I was swimming. I punched it in the back.\n“I was about to start paddling again and I had this instinct someone was behind me. I saw the whole thing just thrashing around. I punched it a couple of times, but I felt like it was dragging me under.\n“Then all of a sudden my leg rope broke and I was swimming and screaming.\n“I was swimming in and I had this thought, what if it comes for another go at me?\n“So I turned around, so I could at least see it, and before I knew it the boat was there, the jetskis were there.’’\nNot quite the reality we witnessed on live television in July.\n####\n Fanning ‘upset’ by KFC’s shark attack ad", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/sport/were-very-upset-mick-fannings-mother-attacks-kfc-ad-parodying-shark-attack-20151018-gkc82r", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F19%2FDVU_KFC-PARODY_AD.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0741ecd56fe643e7590b6879ed2c1647", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dd4f3521247d5725143f606e3d83fb02", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/kfc-shark-commercial-spoofs-mick-fannings-j-bay-final-attack/story-fnig5e6l-1227573817830", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/84f4a5fb3470b53f474fba49eed88340", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/more-sports/mick-fanning-shark-attack-australian-continues-his-recovery-with-a-surf-at-snapper-rocks/story-fni2frsp-1227458672136?sv=2de7f908d945f5d4a30739a851abe5b1", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/mick-fanning-a-badass-hero-an-aussie-champion/story-fni0cx12-1227449869202"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:29:06.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
