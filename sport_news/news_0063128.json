(Ozarks Sports Zone) -- Scott Bailey didn’t need to say much to set the stage for Friday’s Big 8 championship. His Lamar team was well aware of what was at stake and the history of the budding rivalry with Carl Junction well before Week 9. It is no secret that Lamar has been the most dominant program in Missouri over the last four years, claiming four straight Class 2 state title and turbo clocking nearly every team in its way. But, despite the recent success, the Tigers have never won the Big 8 Conference outright. And, considering the heartbreak of the last two meetings between Carl Junction and Lamar, Bailey didn’t need to hype the matchup any more than the media already had.\"I didn't speak much about it during the week; I didn't do very many interviews during the week,” said Bailey. “And I'll tell you, what we talked to our kids about is it's just another game. If we win this game, we're going to take a couple days off, and we're going to go back to work on Monday. And to be honest with you, I've really got myself to the point, where I was okay with it either way. Carl Junction is an outstanding football team. You look at their coaching staff and to see the amount of experience they have, they're coached extremely well. By the time the game rolled around, I was okay with it either way. I had kind of made my peace with it.” But, his players hadn’t. Sparked by a 24-yard pick-6 by junior Tanner Phipps, Class 2 No. 1 Lamar ripped off 28 unanswered points during the second and third quarters, shocking Class 4 No. 2 Carl Junction 56-34 to claim the Tigers first-ever outright Big 8 Conference championship. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS “Between winning state and winning conference there’s a huge difference, but it was really important for us to get this for Coach Bailey,” said senior running back Danny Embry. “I wanted to get it for my team, but coach is the one I really wanted to get it for. He does so much for us and is such a great guy, and it just feels good for him.\" Phipps interception came on the heels of scoring explosion that saw the two teams combine for 49 points in the game’s first 19 minutes. When Carl Junction senior Dominic Burnett found the end zone on a nine-yard run, the Bulldogs had seemingly regained the momentum of a back-and-forth first half, cutting Lamar’s lead to just seven, 28-21. Lamar thought it had a response on a Luke Hardman touchdown run, but it was called back due to a holding penalty. That drive would end in a Tiger punt. Phipps would change the entire complexion of the game just two plays later.\"That was a huge deal,” said Embry. “Once we start getting that, we always talk about how we feed off of each other. The underclassmen make plays for the seniors, get us the ball back and we score, and it was a big, big, momentum booster.\" That momentum would build when junior Matt Whyman hit classmate Anthony Wilkerson on a 14-yard touchdown strike. Known for having the best running attack in the state, Lamar passed from 120 yards in the first half, making the Bulldogs play for loading the box.\"We run the ball so much that defenses just get continuously closer and closer to the line of scrimmage,” said Bailey. “Mel Tjeerdsma at Northwestern told me one time, 'Scott, throw the ball when you want to, not when you have to.' I've had people around town here say, 'When are you going to throw the ball?' I tell them, ‘When I want to.’ Stuart McKarus is a sophomore for us, but he's a baseball player. He's got an arm. He can throw a lot of those routes to the sideline. He can make throws. He made a couple nice throws for us. He got us good field position with a couple pass plays.” Lamar's lead would grow to 56-21 entering the fourth quarter. Wilkerson would finish with 115 yards and a touchdown on just three receptions. McKarus and Whyman combined to complete all four passes for 156 yards. Lamar was still potent on the ground, with Embry rushing for 126 yards and four touchdowns and Hardman adding 115 yards and a pair of scores. He also had a 46-yard reception and an interception defensively. Carl Junction seemed poised to take the game over after an opening drive took just five plays for the Bulldogs to cover 85 yards and the game’s first touchdown. The Tigers would answer with an Embry touchdown, but the Bulldogs came right back with another scoring drive that took just 1:40 off the clock.\"We needed to get used to the speed,” said Bailey. “You practice against your guys all week and all the sudden you're not practicing against your guys anymore. You're playing against varsity level guys that can run. So all the sudden you've got to get in another gear. I think it took us a little while defensive-wise in the game to get used to playing at that level of speed.\" Burnett finished with 144 yards and three touchdowns for the Bulldogs, while senior quarterback Ryan Devore completed 23 of his 42 attempts for 193 yards. After searching for years, Lamar finally has the elusive Big 8 championship and now can move forward with a chance at a perfect season, something they haven’t done under Bailey. While Bailey knows the true brevity of Friday night’s win won’t sink in for years, he understands just how big the win is for his program, especially with it being the final meeting between the two schools for the foreseeable future.\"You carry it; I'll tell you that,” said Bailey. “It’s a weight that you carry. And I'm just glad that we got to a point today where we finally got a win over them, now we don't have to carry it anymore. I won't know what it really feels like until years down the road when I look back and see it. You start to reflect on it and see what it means to us. 1932, last time a Lamar High School football team won a conference championship outright. So if that’s 1932 to 2015, that’s a lot of football being played.\" Filed Under :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:30:28.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
