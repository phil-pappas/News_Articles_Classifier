A defeat could’ve been devastating. \nLuckily for Vinemont, though, the junior turned what almost certainly looked like a season-deflating letdown into a ferocious comeback that had the Broncos playing a miserable game of Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda. \nBoland rushed for a touchdown, completed a clutch fourth-down pass during a desperation drive and hauled down a huge interception that all but preserved the Eagles’ 29-25 homecoming triumph over Holly Pond. \nShortly afterward, he took a couple of knees in the victory formation before celebrating justly with his teammates as the clock ran to zeroes. \nNot a bad way to end the evening. \n“It felt amazing,” Boland said. “We knew how big this one was to us. That’s why we were so emotional when it was over. Holly Pond has an excellent team, but we did the things we had to do to win. We had this mindset coming into tonight. We had to win.” \nThe exciting victory was the Red and White’s (1-6) first of the season, while Holly Pond fell to 0-7 to extend the state’s longest active losing streak to 27 games dating back to 2012. \n“We’ve gone through a lot this year,” Eagle coach Matt Norris said. “I have seen us go through the bumps and bruises and struggles. I’m truly happy the kids got a taste of victory tonight, but I feel real bad for those kids at Holly Pond. I know how difficult it is. I told them after the game, just keep fighting and playing for coach (Mike) Bates.” \nVinemont struck first in the opening quarter on a 5-yard scoring jaunt from senior John Michael Dye to take a 7-0 lead. \nThe Green and White didn’t stay down long, however, as quarterback Michael Lambert tied it up on a 1-yard sneak early in the second. \nTwo turnovers — downs and a fumble — turned into two Caleb Jones’ touchdown runs later in the frame to give the Broncos a 19-7 advantage. \nA 30-yard scamper by Boland just before halftime cut into the cushion, but Holly Pond responded in kind with a quick drive to open the second half — punctuated by a 10-yard run from Jones — to make it 25-13. \nThen the skies let loose a torrential downpour of rain and crazy things started to happen. \nDifficult snaps, fumbled balls and slippery grass led to a cacophony of messy, sloppy football for both teams. \nOn the ensuing Vinemont possession, Boland coughed it up and Holly Pond’s Luke Wisener raced some 70-plus yards down the sideline for an improbable touchdown. \nUnfortunately for the Green and White, the play was called back to the spot of the fumble due to a holding penalty. \nThe Broncos had two additional game-changing plays — a pick-six late in the first half and a fourth-quarter touchdown jaunt by Lambert erased on penalties as well. \nTough to win when those things happen. \n“That hurts,” Bates said. “Those are three touchdowns gone. But they made plays against us when they had to.” \nThe Eagle defense allowed just 39 yards of offense after the Green and White’s first possession of the second half. Norris and Co. rode that fine effort to cut the deficit to four late in the third quarter on a Dye 4-yarder and put themselves in position to win it with less than two minutes left. \nFaced with a fourth-and-10 in his own territory, Boland threw a bullet pass to Cody Stewart right at the sticks to convert and move the chains. \nTwo plays later, he found Colby Nicholas for a huge gain of 40 down to the Holly Pond 10-yard line. \nDye waltzed into the end zone shortly afterward for his third score of the evening. \n“No matter how much we might have given up on ourselves during a game like this, coach Norris didn’t,” Nicholas said. “It’s outrageous the way we came together and won this one. I couldn’t have made plays if not for my teammates. We’re all just excited right now.” \nAdded Boland: “We knew how important that drive was. If we didn’t make a first down, it’s over. Fortunately, we got that big play by Colby, which set up that last touchdown.” \nHolly Pond’s bid for a comeback was cut short when a trick pass play from Jones to an intended receiver downfield fell into Boland’s waiting, eager arms. \n“They ran that same play to start the game,” he said. “I was thinking, ‘What if they try it again?’ And they did. I just saw the formation, and I tried to make a play.” \nDye carried the ball 23 times for 154 yards and three scores. Boland’s day ended with 125 total yards. Nicholas and Stewart hauled down two passes apiece. \nJones finished his night with 145 yards and three scores on 25 carries, while Lambert notched 60 total yards and a touchdown. Alex Corneglio contributed an interception. \nIt was no doubt a bitter loss to swallow for the Broncos, as many of the players donned in Green and White left the playing field with tears easing their way from eye to cheek. \nBates could offer up only so much comfort. \n“I’m real proud of the kids — they made plays and all that good stuff — but I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired,” he said. “Everything in this life happens for a reason. You’ve got two choices, you fight or you don’t.” \nFor Norris, who earned his first triumph as a head coach, the hope is a win such as this can only serve as a motivator for his team to work hard and keep improving down the line. \n“We did a lot of showing why we are what we are record wise tonight,” he said. “We’re going to try to overcome those things moving forward. If we can do that, we’re going to be fine.” \n% Jake Winfrey can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 136 or at jwinfrey@cullmantimes.com.​ Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:44:51.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
