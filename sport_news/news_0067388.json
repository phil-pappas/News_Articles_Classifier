(AP Photo/Brandon Wade) IRVING, Texas (AP) Dez Bryant has been ruled out for the Dallas Cowboys' game at the New York Giants on Sunday, delaying the All-Pro receiver's return from a broken right foot at least another week.\nAdChoices Bryant was downgraded from doubtful Saturday, a day after he didn't travel with the team to New York. He hasn't played since getting injured in the opener against the Giants.\nThe Cowboys (2-3) have lost all three games without Bryant and quarterback Tony Romo, who broke his left collarbone a week after Bryant went out. After the game against the Giants (3-3), Romo will miss at least three more games.\nReceiver Brice Butler will be available for Dallas after missing a loss to New England with a strained hamstring. The Cowboys traded for Butler after Bryant's injury.\n---\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:35:29.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
