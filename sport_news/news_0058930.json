Van Emst/Auburn University) \nAUBURN — Different. \nThis is the word Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn chose to describe a trip back to his home state of Arkansas this Saturday and that one word is about as emotional as the Tigers third-year coach will get about it. \nWhile knowing it’s nearly impossible to avoid the questions, Malzahn has refused to acknowledge the importance of winning in his home state more than any of the other remaining five Southeastern Conference games on Auburn’s 2015 schedule. \n“It’s always different,” Malzahn said of going back to Arkansas. “That’s where I grew up. I spent 15 years coaching high school football there.” \nIn a roundabout way, one of those jobs is not allowing Arkansas coach Bret Bielema have any instant talking points for next year’s matchup as the Razorbacks coach acknowledged this week what a win against Malzahn and his never-ending presence in the state would do for the Arkansas program. \n“As you become acquainted with the Arkansas fan base and everything else, everybody always wants to beat certain teams and I probably hear it more about that game than anything,” Bielema said. \nAt this point in 2015, the quotes and stories have been well documented, something Bielema was well aware of Monday during his weekly press conference. \n“I don’t have a problem with him,” Bielema said about Malzahn Monday. \nArkansas coach Bret Bielema traded barbs with Missouri's Gary Pinkel on Wednesday.

The list of Bielema’s 2015 targets also includes Malzahn, Ohio State coach Urban Meyer, Texas coach Charlie Strong and Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury. \nLast month, Arkansas athletic director Jeff Long told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette at a meeting of the Little Rock Touchdown Club that \"Bret speaks from his heart.” \n“That’s one thing media folks and our fan base enjoy,” Long said on Sept. 21. “He has opinions. He shares those opinions. He’s truthful. He’s honest and he is who he is. Bret, to my knowledge, hasn’t done anything embarrassing to me or the university.\" \nOne of Bielema’s opinions that he may have flipped on was on the player dangers of the no-huddle tempo offenses, something that new Arkansas offensive coordinator Dan Enos is now utilizing in spurts with the Razorbacks offense. According to Arkansas is still 103rd in the country in adjusted pace of play but they have more explosive plays than Auburn this season. The Razorbacks have nearly twice as many plays over 20 yards as Auburn (28 to 17) this season. \n“I think around college football people are looking for advantages to help their team and people do think it's an advantage,” Malzahn said Tuesday on the hurry up offense that Arkansas is using at times.

Malzahn was the head coach at Springdale High School from 2001-2005 and led the program to two state championship game appearances and won the title in 2005. \n“My family’s there, Kristi’s family is there (and) a lot of my best friends are there but you have a job to do,” Malzahn said Monday on his ‘Tiger Talk’ radio show about playing at Arkansas. \nMalzahn, offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee , running back coach Tim Horton and offensive line coach J.B. Grimes all have ties to the state of the Arkansas. \n“Everybody does try to make something of it,” Lashlee said Sunday of the Arkansas connection on the Tigers staff. “It’s where we are from and I went to school there. You always want to put your best foot forward when you go back home. We just want to get another SEC win and that’s the honest truth.” Auburn coach Gus Malzahn talks about facing Arkansas in the second of back-to-back road games Saturday.
