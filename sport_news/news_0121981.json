(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) By KEVIN FISHBAIN — kfishbain@chicagofootball.com \nHow to watch/listen: Noon kickoff on Fox (Sam Rosen, John Lynch, Pam Oliver); can be heard on WBBM 780 AM and 105.9 FM (Jeff Joniak, Tom Thayer, Zach Zaidman) \nLast time they met: 12/4/2011: Chiefs win 10-3 at Soldier Field \nKey matchup to watch: Bears defense vs. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — Yes, Jamaal Charles is one of the best backs in the league and will attract plenty of attention, but Kelce is a matchup nightmare. Unlike the other very good tight end the Bears faced this season (Jimmy Graham), Kelce is a big part of his team’s offense. He has 21 catches for 293 yards, averaging 14 yards a catch. He has four catches for 20 yards or more and 13 of his receptions have gone for first downs. Kelce, at 6-5, 260 pounds, is more than just a safety valve for Alex Smith. Shea McClellin has been close in coverage this season when asked to cover, but he hasn’t made a play on the ball. Adrian Amos may be asked to show what he can do in pass coverage if Kelce gets up the seam. \nThe Bears will win if…: The pass rush rattles Alex Smith the way the Bengals’ defense got after him (10 QB hits, five sacks). The weakness on the Chiefs is their offensive line, but Pernell McPhee and Jarvis Jenkins will need some help. The Bears have to get production from the other edge rusher spot, whether it’s Sam Acho, Lamarr Houston or Willie Young. On offense, a patchwork offensive line must handle the Arrowhead Stadium noise and prevent Justin Houston and Tamba Hali from getting to Jay Cutler. Adam Gase has put together some nice game plans, and if the Bears execute, they’ll find opportunities against the other worst scoring defense in the league. \nThe Chiefs will win if…: They protect Smith. If he has time to run Andy Reid’s offense, the Chiefs will be able to move the ball against the Bears’ defense. Smith avoids mistakes better than most quarterbacks around the league and has three game-breakers — Charles, Kelce and Jeremy Maclin — to utilize. On defense, the Chiefs have the talent to exploit the Bears’ issues up front, they just have to actually pressure the quarterback, which they haven’t done the past two weeks. That’ll help physical corners Sean Smith and Marcus Peters, who are ball hawks and will be waiting for any Cutler mistake. \nFishbain’s pick: Chiefs 30, Bears 27", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:05:09.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
