Not when you lose a winnable game 6-4 in 14 innings as the Jays did on Friday.\nNot when they have two hits in their final 32 at-bats (.063) — one a Ben Revere infield single in the eighth inning, the other a Chris Colabello single leading off the 12th.\nThe rest of the time: P tt.\nBlame plate ump Vic Carapazza — as both teams did for 13 innings.\nOr blame the replay officials in New York. But the fact remains the Jays are hitting a lusty .146 (12-for-82) after two games.\nWho woulda thunk a week ago that the Jays would have their backs against the walls of Six Flags over Arlington?\n“There is less margin for error now, but we still have to win three games,” Jose Bautista told reporters. “We played great but they outplayed us. Yes, I saw the play at second and I saw the replay on the board.”\nWith two out in the 14th, Rougned Odor singled off LaTroy Hawkins, then so did Chris Gimenez. Bautista came up throwing behind Odor and Troy Tulowitzki applied the tag at second. Even though Odor’s foot seemed to come off the bag, he was ruled safe. Jays manager John Gibbons asked for a replay, but the call stood.\n“I’d like to get an answer from the replay booth in New York. I know it’s not protocol,” said Bautista. “But Toronto fans deserve an answer.”\nHanser Alberto, the back-up infielder who took over for injured Adrian Beltre at third, then singled home the speedy Odor with the game-winner.\nBautista like a lot of other Jays players, wasn’t touching any questions about the strike zone, which appeared in some innings, as one player said, as if it were on wheels.\n“We made some errors in the first,” Bautista said “The ball hit my glove as I hit the wall (on a leadoff Delino DeShields drive). I should have made the play.”\nThe first four Rangers reached before Colabello tagged out Josh Hamilton at first, then ran to third to tag Prince Fielder for a not-so-routine double play.\n“You can’t look back at one moment,” said Colabello. “It’s a collective thing. If we field the ball in the first, if the ball stays in Jose’s glove, if the ball doesn’t come off the turf, skip off Ryan Goins’ mitt, if Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion don’t hit balls home-run distance that are 3-5-7 feet or whatever foul, it’s a different game.\n“You have to make your own breaks. The task is to win three games, not two. We still have a chance.”\nTOUGH ODDS\nTeams losing the first games at home and heading on to the road are 2-27 in best-of-five series. The 2012 San Francisco Giants rallied to beat the Cincinnati Reds and the 2001 New York Yankees came back to beat the Oakland A’s — Derek Jeter making that back-handed flip, that perhaps you saw on the highlights.\nStill, 2-27 is not a good ratio if you are charting and rooting along at home.\n“It’s been a bit crazy,” said reliever Aaron Sanchez, who recorded the final two outs in the 12th, then pitched a scoreless 13th. “I would have liked to have gone out a third time, too. Now? Now we’ll have to go down there and win two and get the series back here before our fans.”\nCOULDN'T HOLD IT\nThe Jays had a 4-3 lead with four outs remaining when Mike Napoli singled off Brett Cecil to force extras.\nAs late-season ones-that-got-away go, this reminded us of Game 160 on a Friday night at old Exhibition Stadium in 1985. Tom Henke had two out, fans were ready to celebrate Toronto’s first American League East Division title when Yankees’ Butch Wynegar hit a homer and, three batters later, Lloyd Moseby dropped a ball in the rain as the Jays lost.\nThey won the next day, Game 161 a Saturday afternoon, by hitting three homers.\nNow, the Jays need to have three Saturdays from 1985 in a row ...\nOr they can begin slapping line drives to right field, which is likely pretty tough at this stage.\nYou live by the three-run homer ... and you know how the rest goes ... you get eliminated when you don’t have the three-run homer.\nThe only other remaining option: See y’all next season.\nIt’s up to them.\nHOUSE HUNTING\nRealtors say incoming president Mark Shapiro, who is leaving the Cleveland Indians to take over for Paul Beeston as Blue Jays president, has purchased a home in Leaside. That would be different than former general manager J.P. Ricciardi, who lived in Oakville one year at Glen Abbey golf course and then spent the rest of his tenure as Jays GM living in Worcester, Mass.\nEMPTY THE BENCHES\nReliever Keone Kela quick- pitched Donaldson to lead off the 13th. Donaldson hit a ball home run distance but it was foul and then began yelling at Kela, who walked toward the plate ... On-deck hitter Bautista became involved in the shouting match, too, as benches emptied, but only insults were exchanged.\n“I’m not going to let Josh stand out there defenceless,” said Bautista. “(Kela) began to walk toward the plate and their dugout began to empty.”\nBRIEFLY\nMarie-Claude Pelland-Marcotte was the official scorekeeper for this one and had about enough ink for one more inning, recording 19 hits, including three doubles and a homer, 25 strikeouts, six walks, three stolen bases, 15 pitchers and 423 total pitches ... The headline on ESPN jars you: “Hanser Alberto’s RBI single in 14th puts Rangers up 2-0 on Jays” Two days ago, I knew only of Alberto Callaspo of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Alberto VO5 ... Scout Tim Conroy of the Kansas City Royals has been scouting the Jays for the past 34 games but now has help. One of the Royals heavy hitters, and most respected scouts in the game (as his father was) Jim Fregosi, Jr. rolled into town to evaluate the Jays.\nTELEVISION TALK\nSportsnet picked up the MLB Network feed with Jim Kaat, Ken Rosenthal and Bob Costas in Game 2, after carrying FOX for Game 1 ... Costas paid Tom Cheek, the former Jays broadcaster and Ford C. Frick Award winner a nice tribute ... MLB Network archivists unearthed footage of John Gibbons’ one and only home run in the majors on Friday. Gibbons went deep to left against Philadelphia Phillies reliever Michael Jackson leading off the eighth in a 9-5 New York Mets win at Shea Stadium. Gibbons hit .220 in 57 plate appearances in parts of two seasons with the Mets.\nTOO MUCH REST\nDavid Price hit Yankees’ Jacoby Ellsbury with a 3-2 pitch on April 22 at Comerica Park and it took 200 innings later until he hit another left-handed hitter in Rougned Odor leading off the third inning of Game 1. And two innings later, he hit Odor again. Odor saw four Price pitches. He took a pitch, was hit twice and hit a solo homer. The only other hitters Price hit in his 200 innings were right-handed hitters Jose Abreu of the White Sox and Billy Burns of the A’s. Price was working on 11 days rest ... The Rangers’ Nos. 2-through-7 hitters, were a combined 1-for-21 (.048) with three walks and seven strikeouts against Price. The one hit was Beltre’s run-scoring single in the third inning. Yet, the 8-9-1 portion was a combined 4-for-10 (.400) with a double, two homers and four RBIs. Odor (the No. 8 hitter), Robinson Chirinos (No. 9) and DeShields (No. 1) did most of the hitting in Game 1.\nPRE-GAME PITCHING\nOn the ceremonial opening pitch, Pat Hentgen threw a strike — if Galen Cisco were umping — to Mark Buehrle. Hentgen won 19 games for the 1993 Jays who beat the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nMLB PLAYOFFS\nBlue Jays can't just rely on home runs to win games in post-season\nBy Bob Elliott , Toronto Sun First posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 12:24 AM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 10, 2015 01:14 AM EDT\nThe thing about teams that live and die with the home run: They don’t always hit home runs in the post-season.\nStrike-throwers are a different animal in October, not pitching as long, so they are throwing harder and pitching staffs eliminate back-end guys due to the off days.\nThe Texas Rangers have hit two home runs in 23 innings over two games of this best-of-five American League Division Series.\nAnd Your Toronto Blue Jays have hit just two home runs, as well.\nUnless Jays hitters suddenly find a better two-strike approach — maybe over Arkansas on Friday’s charter, or during Saturday’s workout — it will be: See you in Dunedin, have a nice winter.\nA 93-win season doesn’t get you far in the post-season.
