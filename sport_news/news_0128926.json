Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 4:24 PM Updated at 7:20 PM Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 4:24 PM Updated at 7:20 PM In Jimbo Fisher’s six-year tenure as Florida State head coach, the Seminoles have had more than their fair share of blue chip defensive players. From Tim Jernigan to Lamarcus Joyner, Bjoern Werner, Mario Edwards, Eddie Goldman, P.J. Williams, and Ronald Darby, the Seminoles have no shortage of guys who came in and made a big mark on the program before heading off to the NFL. Despite FSU’s impressive collection, such talents are rare commodities on most college teams. What has become perhaps even rarer in recent years is the college player who sticks it out despite early setbacks or adversity and becomes an impact player after four or even five years in the program. The Seminoles have a handful of players this season that fit that bill with fifth-year senior defenders Tyler Hunter, Terrance Smith, Lamarcus Brutus, Nile Lawrence-Stample, and Giorgio Newberry. That core group has played an important role on a strong FSU defense that is currently ranked No. 13 in the country, accounting for five of the team’s top 14 tacklers so far this season. Several are playing bigger roles than they have played in past seasons and Fisher said at Wednesday’s ACC Football Coaches Teleconference that they have stepped up to the challenge. “It’s a great group of guys that, whether it’s been through injuries that they haven’t played or had other great players in front of them, they’ve bided their time and now they’re playing significant roles,” he said. “They’re not just being a part of it, but being great players and having a chance to go to the next level.” After playing on the scout team early in his career, Brutus has emerged as a steady force at safety, starting all four games and ranking fourth on the team with 18 tackles and an interception, helping fill the void at safety after All American Jalen Ramsey’s move to cornerback this season. Brutus’ defensive backfield mate Hunter also has nine tackles and an interception. Smith is fifth on the team with 16 tackles and 3.5 tackles for loss at linebacker, while the defensive tackle Newberry has added 10 tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss, and 1.5 sacks. Lawrence-Stample, who missed last season due to injury, has started all four games at defensive tackle and has 11 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, and a sack. While they have produced numbers on the field, Fisher said the maturity and experience of those fifth-year seniors off the field is just as valuable for the Seminoles, especially given how much the landscape of college football has changed over the years. “In the old days, you really counted on those fourth and fifth year guys,” he said. “In today’s time, you don’t get that many because guys are in and out or they transfer, so (it’s good) to have that in our team with some very unique guys who are good football players, but they’re more mature and they’re men. Page 2 of 2 - “We talk about wanting guys to be men, but when you’re 18, 19, 20 (years old), it’s hard to be a man. When you get to 21, 22, 23, you start to understand it. You look back on things you did and start to realize, ‘what I did back then was silly. I don’t need to do that.’ Then you prepare better, you do better, and you set an example for the other guys and there’s a precedent and a toughness mentally, physically, and psychologically that they bring.” They also bring a personal experience with adversity that many of the younger Seminoles – some of whom have only dealt with defeat once in their college careers – don’t have and might not appreciate. “It’s not all peaches and cream. It’s not all roses,” Fisher said. “You’ve got to work for things. Adversity will happen and you’ve got to keep fighting through it. It’s a great example. They can keep reminding those guys, some of the younger guys who are not playing as well or not getting as much playing time, and say, ‘hey listen, keep working like I did and look what’s gonna happen here.’ “It’s a great example. I wish we could have a throwback to 20 years where we have more of those guys on the team. It’s fun to coach those guys because you watch what they’ve overcome, but you see how mature they are.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:03:21.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
