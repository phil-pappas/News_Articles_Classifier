There were questions as to when officers should and shouldn’t record, and whether they would be able to view the videos before writing their reports.\n“Since it’s just like a black box for most of us lay people, it seems like there still might be room for people to fool around with the images,” said Karen Mitzner, who spoke up several times during the meeting.\nOther audience members raised the question of an officer intentionally choosing not to record an encounter. A member of PPB’s command staff responded that any officer who does so would “have a lot of explaining to do.”\nThe Police Bureau will host two more public meetings, seeking input about its policy. The agency plans to equip 600 officers and with body cameras by Spring, 2016.\nCopyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
