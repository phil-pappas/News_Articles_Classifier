No David Silva? No Problem By Kudzai Mahwite (columnist) 19 Oct 2015 09:46:02 \nreads \ncomments \nMost Manchester City fans, pundits and even opposition fans were of the opinion that the Citizens would find life at least a tiny bit difficult without their two best players in Aguero and Silva. However, what happened on Saturday seemed to be quite the contrary. \nInstead of exhibiting a dip in confidence and an obvious depletion in fluidity, creativity and tenacity, Manchester City managed to put five past a seemingly hapless AFC Bournemouth side. Raheem Sterling was undoubtedly the star of the show as he breezed to a first half hat trick. Wilfried Bony was also on target with Kevin de Bruyne also at his creative best. \nBefore the match, the prognosis had been that Manchester City would struggle even to score without their talisman Sergio Aguero but Bony seems very much sufficient for their goal scoring needs. Summer signings Sterling and de Bruyne had to step up to cover for their injured counterparts and step up they did. \nThose who thought points would be dropped at the Etihad received a clear message that the Blues are in no mood to relinquish their hold on top spot now or under any circumstances. It definitely will not be injuries that stop the City juggernaut or will it be Manchester United in the upcoming Manchester derby.
