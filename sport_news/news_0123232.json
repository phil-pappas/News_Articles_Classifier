Yards, first downs, yards per play. The Bills and Bengals stayed even. \nYet, little drama existed in the 34-21 win. Much of that had to do with hidden yards. \nSunday the average Bills drive started at the 15-yard line. The average Bengals drive started at their own 41. Both teams had 10 meaningful possessions, basic math says that’s a 260-yard advantage. \nConsider the game changed. A game the Bengals have played better than any in football all season. \nThey are tied for first in best average drive start in the league with their own 34 and also tied for the league lead in best defensive drive start with the opponent's 21. That’s an average of 130 yards in head start yards per game. \n“Our big rallying cry has been being able to control field position,” special team coordinator Darrin Simmons said. \nConsider this: 11 times this year a Bengals opponent was forced to start a drive inside their own 10-yard line. Those drives resulted in one field goal. Only three times did an opponent even cross their own 30 before giving the ball back. \nThose momentum swings often start on the left foot of punter Kevin Huber. For the second consecutive season he ranks in the top five in net punting. Coming off his first Pro Bowl appearance last year he continues to prove his craft spans far beyond seeing how far the ball can travel. \nHe’s shown versatility in directional kicks as well as mastering the end-over-end punts pinning the ball inside the 20-yard line. Cincinnati Bengals specialists Mike Nugent, Kevin Huber and Clark Harris on Cincinnati.com's Beyond the Stripes, presented by JosephAuto.com from The Moerlein Lager House. The Enquirer/Glenn Hartong \nFor the second straight season he ranks in the top five in the league in net punting average. He also has 12 kicks downed inside the 20 compared to only two touchbacks. \n“My part is giving them the best opportunity possible and giving (the gunners) a chance,” Huber said. “There’s guys a lot of time when they have a higher touchback number they don’t really have the touch to get it down there. Whether it comes from lack of practice or don’t know how to do it. Fact we can do it, with the gunners we have this year and last year … guys that know how to tackle, are fast and have good ball skills is huge. I know if I put the ball anywhere down there they are going to get on the ball. Put the ball down close to the end zone and give them a chance to make a play.” \nDre Kirkpatrick manned the gunner position last year along with Darqueze Dennard. Two former first-round draft picks specializing in special teams made for an elite group pinning punts. Josh Shaw and Brandon Tate have both stepped into the role of Kirkpatrick, who moved to starting corner. \nThe transition continues to evolve, but results have not fallen off. Toss in a game-changing threat at punt returner like Adam Jones and the equation for dominating field position stands in place. \n“Our guys take a pride in it,” Simmons said. “Making a tackle inside the 20 or downing a punt inside the 5, those are big plays in the game. Whenever we are able to see plays in advance, looking plays ahead, we make the tackle inside the 20 gives our defense a chance to pin their ears back and come after them. When that happens it gives us a chance vice the gunners up and go after a long punt return.” 10 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1RWGSwB TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:46:09.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
