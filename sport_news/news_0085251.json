(Nati Harnik / AP) FAU staying confident despite struggles \nAt this point, Florida Atlantic football coach Charlie Partridge could easily start thinking of wholesale changes. \nThe Owls are 1-5, with their lone win coming against a team (Charlotte) in its first year competing at the Division I-A level. Even with the struggles, the staff is thinking more tweaking than overhauling personnel or the playbook. \n\"It's really just to continue to fight and execute at a higher level,\" Partridge said Monday. You may tweak a thing here or there.\" \nThe Owls lost 33-17 to Marshall last Saturday, dropping to 1-2 in Conference USA.

Rodriguez, who rushed for 72 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts, took the carries from starter Buddy Howell. \n\"We'll continue to do some things like that, but all of our focus is on UTEP,\" Partridge said. \nA new name in QB mix \nWith quarterback Jaquez Johnson still ailing from a high ankle sprain, there is a chance the Owl start their third player at the position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:53:50.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
