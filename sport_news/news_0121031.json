The Warriors won, 1-0, snapping the Patriots 27-game winning streak.\nIt only counts for one victory on the record, but for Hosford, it was a performance that showed that his team is better prepared for the challenges it faces in the Div. 1 North tournament, after two consecutive years of early exits.\n“Concord-Carlisle has gotten the best of us at least the last six times we’ve played them,” Hosford said. “It was a good win against a very good program, and I do think there are teams that you try and emulate and teams that you try and match up with and be as good as, and Concord-Carlisle has been that over the years.\n“To be able to beat them was a good measuring stick at that point in the season. If you can play with the class of not only the DCL but also the state, you’ve done well at least for that game. Hopefully, we can keep that momentum going because the level of competition we see in the DCL is what we will see in the tournament.”\nWhile getting off to a 7-1-1 start, the Warriors are still searching for additional ways to put the ball in the net, and that begins with senior captain and goalkeeper Bobby Hurstak. Called the heart-and-soul of the team by his coach, Hurstak has been a fixture since his freshman year. His leadership on and off the field has done wonders for a team that has some unfinished business.\n“He is a very good goalie with good instincts and a player who is fearless,” Hosford said. “I’ve been impressed with him because ever since ninth grade he hasn’t been afraid to lead in a positive way. He is the identity of this team in a lot of ways, and the guys respect what he brings to practice and to games.”\nSenior midfielder and captain Zach Beyloune anchors the midfield while senior Noah Corin and talented junior Ryan Donlan lead a defensive corps that has shut opposing offenses down in their tracks. Add in the spirited play of sophomore forward Rory Bordiuk, and the Warriors have the makings of being a serious state championship contender.\nSaid Hosford: “This is a team we hoped would be as competitive, if not more competitive, than teams from past years. We are good defensively, but we are still looking for ways on offense, but we have balance and that has put us in a good spot.”\nEye on the prize\nIf a recipe for a successful season leans toward programs that have players with big-game experience, then the Bishop Fenwick girls are in good shape.\nA year after losing in the quarterfinals of the Div. 3 North tournament, the Crusaders returned eight seniors and 13 juniors this fall, and the results speak volumes as Fenwick got off to a 7-0 start in the ultra-competitive Catholic Central League.\n“We have a large group of returnees and we have great senior leadership,” coach Karen Guillemette said. “There is a bigger goal, and I laid it out there to the girls at the beginning of the season that I think we have a team that could win a state championship, or go far in the state tournament.”\nAt the top of the list of seniors providing leadership and production are captains Merry Harrington (goalie), Colleen Corcoran (forward), Danielle DelTorto (forward), and Ellen Fantozzi (defender). Each of these players, as well as the rest of the senior class, epitomize the school’s motto of being a family.\n“This team is close and everybody gets along, and they love spending time together, but it always comes back to senior leadership,” Guillemette said.\nAnd with a junior class headlined by Allyson Charette, Emily Charette, Emily Smith, Abbey Rocker and Mikayla Porcaro, the Crusaders have the foundation for continued success. But, as is always the case, Fenwick will continue to improve each day.\n“The kids really believe in themselves, but we will still take it one game at a time.”\nWillis collects 100th\nCongratulations to Cohasset boys coach Jim Willis, who earned his 100th career win as coach of the Skippers last week.
