The header beat goalkeeper Hope Solo and was the earliest goal allowed by the U.S. in more than two years. \nThe Americans extended their home unbeaten streak to 101 matches, their last loss coming on Nov. 6, 2004, against Denmark in Philadelphia during a post-Olympic victory tour after the 2004 Athens Games.
