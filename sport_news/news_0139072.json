(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) more > By -   \nLAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) - Sport’s highest court has rejected Brazil’s attempt to overturn Neymar’s ban from two World Cup qualifiers. \nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport issued a fast-track verdict Friday ahead of Brazil’s away game against Chile on Oct. 8. \nThe court’s ruling means Neymar will miss that game and the Oct. 13 home qualifier against Venezuela. \nNeymar is completing a four-match sanction imposed at the Copa America in June. The Confederation for Brazilian Football had wanted the ban enforced only at the next Copa America. \nCAS says the reasons for its decision to reject the CBF appeal will be published at a later date. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:20:13.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
