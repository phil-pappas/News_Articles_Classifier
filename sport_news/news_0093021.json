(lehighvalleylive.com file photo) By Kyle Craig | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 22, 2015 12:30 PM \nNo one can accuse Parkland High School’s girls volleyball team of ducking a challenge. \nThe 2015 Trojans will go anywhere for good competition, even if that means traveling across the United States. \nEarlier this month, Parkland, which had a perfect season last fall en route to a PIAA Class AAA title, trekked to Phoenix for the Nike Tournament of Champions, an event filled with defending state champions from across the country. \nThe talented field and the reputation of West Coast volleyball had the Trojans dealing with the unknown. \n“We knew it would be really, really good competition,” said senior libero Avery Perosa , a University of Pittsburgh commit. “We weren’t really sure how we’d measure up to it.” \n“We always go into any game thinking we want to win, but we were definitely excited to see how we compared to the rest of the country,” said senior setter Kristin Krause , who is headed to Penn State. “I think we were a little nervous going in, thinking that these teams were going to be really scary and really intense.” \nA lot of those nerves dissipated when Parkland crushed Flagstaff (Ariz.) 25-3 in the opening set of pool play. \n“They want to play the best,” Parkland coach Mike Krause said. “I think, as athletes, that’s an exciting challenge. And these kids love challenges.” \nThe Trojans went unbeaten in pool play and – two wins later – rolled into the semifinals before falling to P.K. Yonge (Fla.), currently the fourth-ranked team in the country by MaxPreps. Desert Vista (Ariz.) rallied past Parkland in its next game, sending the Trojans to a fourth-place finish. \nThe defending state champs completed a stretch of 35 sets in 11 days across 5,600 miles and returned with valuable knowledge, despite the unfamiliar sensation of losing. \n“That was amazing experience,” said senior opposite hitter Siena Salvaggio , a state champion swimmer also headed to Penn State. “It definitely brought us closer together.” \n“They came back with a personal pride that we represented Pennsylvania and we represented our league,” Mike Krause said. \nIt also prepared the Trojans to defend their Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, District 11 and PIAA crowns. \n“I think that was the most important part of the whole thing, bringing it back now to our play here in Pennsylvania,” Perosa said. \nParkland defeated Whitehall last Friday to improve to 16-0, meaning the Trojans have now won 99 consecutive regular-season match play contests – a mind-boggling streak that goes back to 2009. \nParkland defeated Freedom in the EPC quarterfinals Tuesday and plays Central Catholic 7 p.m. Thursday in the semifinals at Whitehall. \nIt would be understandable if the Trojans lost their edge, considering the accolades they’ve already added to their resume. Their five senior captains, however, won’t tolerate a letdown. \n“I think we’re definitely still hungry (to win),” Kristin Krause said. “We’re a very competitive group. Even at practices, it gets pretty intense and we always want to win.” \nKristin Krause, Salvaggio, Perosa, Erika Foose and Sam Webber provide the leadership that keeps the team on track. \n“That’s something that’s special about these girls,” Perosa said. “Everybody here, not only the seniors, we’re so competitive — with each other especially.” \nPracticing with their team managers, members of the defending PIAA boys volleyball championship squad, only increases the internal battle for the Trojans. \n“Practices are always very fun,” Salvaggio said. “It’s very competitive and a great way to get better.” \nThe national tournament, unforgiving practices and another dominant regular season have geared Parkland for its ultimate goal: protecting its spot on top of the PIAA mountain. \nAnd there’s no time to bask in success at the moment. \n“We’re going to reflect on this when the season ends,” Mike Krause said, “but we’ve got to prepare for our next competition.” \nThat grand reflection might have to wait a while.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:09:17.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
