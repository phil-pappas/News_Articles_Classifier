(Photo: Rod Sanford/Lansing State Journal) Buy Photo MSU OL/RBs VS. Michigan DL/LBs \nAll-America center Jack Allen became the latest to join MSU's injury casualty list Saturday against Rutgers. He hurt his ankle playing left tackle, replacing Jack Conklin, who missed his second straight game with a knee injury, after backup Dennis Finley broke his leg against Purdue. Kodi Kieler (knee) returned but appeared limited physically. The Spartans generated 489 yards against the Scarlet Knights, including 122 on the ground. With the status of Madre London (ankle) unknown, LJ Scott, Gerald Williams and Delton Williams should split the carries. Michigan’s defense, ranked No. 2 overall and among the top 5 in six categories, is coming off three straight shutouts for the first time since 1980. It hasn’t allowed a 100-yard rusher in the past five games. Defensive end Willie Henry has four of the Wolverines’ 15 sacks and six of their tackles for a loss. \nEdge: Even MSU QBs/WRs VS. Michigan DBs \nThe Spartans opened up their passing game against Rutgers for the first time in three weeks, with quarterback Connor Cook and receiver Aaron Burbridge doing the bulk of the damage. Cook set a career high with 367 yards, including touchdown passes to Macgarrett Kings Jr. and DeAnthony Arnett. Burbridge caught 10 passes for 156 yards as Cook spread his 24 completions among six receivers. MSU continues to await the return of tight end Josiah Price (ankle). Cook went 12 of 22 for 227 yards and a touchdown against U-M a year ago. Safety Jabril Peppers (21 tackles, five pass breakups) and cornerback Jourdan Lewis (17 tackles, eight PBUs, two interceptions) are the anchors of the Michigan secondary, which has matured dramatically from a year ago. The Wolverines allow just 115.5 yards a game through the air, lowest in the Big Ten and second-fewest nationally. \nEdge: MSU MSU DL/LBs VS. Michigan OL/RBs \nRutgers ran for 141 yards against MSU’s front seven last week, including a 72-yarder by Paul James that continued a three-game trend of allowing a run of 40-plus yards. The Spartans sacked quarterback Chris Loviano three times, with Malik McDowell and Lawrence Thomas each getting one. MSU’s linebackers also continue to thrive, with Riley Bullough (55), Jon Reschke (38) and Darien Harris (37) the top three on the team in tackles. Michigan has given the bulk of the carries to De’Veon Smith, who has 398 yards and four touchdowns on 77 carries. However, the Wolverines aren’t afraid to hand the ball to other players while building their 201.3 yards per game on the ground. The continually improving line, the same group of five through the first six games, has allowed eight sacks. \nEdge: MSU MSU DBs VS. Michigan QBs/WRs \nRutgers receiver Leonte Carroo took full advantage of the Spartans’ deficiencies and depleted depth chart at cornerback last week for seven catches for 134 yards and three touchdowns against Arjen Colquhoun, Darian Hicks and Jermaine Edmonson. Hicks’ status for this week is unclear after he suffered a head injury. That could mean shuffling the secondary, perhaps forcing Demetrious Cox to slide back over to the corner and youngsters Khari Willis, Grayson Miller or Matt Morrissey to join struggling Montae Nicholson at safety. Michigan quarterback Jake Rudock has gradually become much better as a game manager after throwing three interceptions in a Week 1 loss at Utah. The fifth-year senior transfer from Iowa hasn’t cracked the 200-yard plateau since passing for 279 in that game, averaging 189.2 per game, and he now has five touchdowns to six picks. Receiver Amara Darboh and tight end Jake Butt have become his go-to targets, combining for 47 catches for 554 yards and three scores. However, Rudock has spread his 106 completions around among 18 different Wolverines. \nEdge: Michigan SPECIAL TEAMS \nPunter Jake Hartbarger and kickoff specialist Kevin Cronin were pulled from last week’s game at Rutgers, but coaches wouldn’t say if it was performance- or injury-based. Backup quarterback Tyler O’Connor stepped in for Hartbarger, whose two first-half punts went 11 and 24 yards. Michael Geiger had one field goal attempt blocked and the other barely hit the upright and banked in from 30 yards away. Michigan’s Jehu Chesson returned the opening kickoff against Northwestern for a 96-yard touchdown in earning last week’s Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week honors. Peppers, who returns both punts and kickoffs, also is dangerous. Punter Blake O’Neill is averaging 40.2 yards, with five of his 26 punts going more than 50 yards and 14 of them landing inside the 20. Kicker Kenny Allen is 7 of 9. \nEdge: Michigan COACHES \nMark Dantonio barely extended his MSU-best streak of 11 straight road victories a week ago, and his program’s 10 straight wins rank as the second-most in school history behind the 11 straight won between the loss to Notre Dame in 2013 and the loss to Oregon in 2014. He’s won six of the last seven meetings with Michigan. Yet for 9 1/2 months, Dantonio rarely has been able to escape the shadow of new U-M coach Jim Harbaugh. The former Wolverines quarterback left a successful stint with the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers to return to his alma mater, sending a shot of energy through the fan base and resurrecting a muddling program faster than many expected. Harbaugh is the first alum-turned-coach in this series since MSU’s George Perles and the first at Michigan since Bump Elliott and Bennie Oosterbaan. \nEdge: Even INTANGIBLES \nThe team that has run the ball for more yards has won in this battle in 42 of the last 45 meetings, with U-M entering Saturday averaging 28 more yards per game through six games. MSU is 6-0 in Ann Arbor all-time with both teams ranked in the Associated Press Top 25. The Spartans have won two of the last three at Michigan Stadium, with their only loss to the Wolverines in the past seven seasons a 12-10 defeat there in 2012. The past two meetings were in East Lansing, which means none of the fifth-year seniors were on MSU’s roster the last time they won in “The Big House” back in 2010. Dantonio will leverage that legacy-making opportunity this week as a motivator. However, Harbaugh understands what this rivalry means and how it’s played on the field. \nEdge: Even Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1RMPHc6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:54:21.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
