It doesn't mean they shouldn't be put out of their misery. One of those traditions that's outlived its usefulness for Alabama: #TennesseeHateWeek. \nWhy in the name of Paul Bryant and Bob Neyland would Alabama hate Tennessee in 2015? \nAlabama has won three national championships since the last time the Vols won the SEC East. The Crimson Tide has been ranked No. 1 in the country at some point every single year since the Vols last finished a season with 10 wins. \nAlabama has yet to climb to the top of the polls this season, but the way the running game is rolling and the defense is stifling at every level, it seems just a matter of time . \nThere was a time when it was right and proper for Alabama fans to send a little clean old-fashioned hate Tennessee's way, but that time should be studied in elementary schools from Mobile to Mentone as a segment of American history. \nRELATED: Philip Doyle kicked Alabama past UT 25 years ago \nUT hasn't been the same since the man Alabama fans used to call the Great Pumpkin, Phillip Fulmer, was ushered toward the door because he wasn't getting it done anymore. Little did the Tennessee administration know at the time that its status as a championship contender would end with Fulmer's tenure. \nSince Fulmer's last year in 2008, Tennessee has four losing seasons and two winning ones, and the winning records were 7-6 in both 2009 and 2014. Lane Kiffin gave the program a pulse in the first year after Fulmer, then bolted for his dream job with the nightmare ending at USC. \nIt should be noted that the only competitive game during this eight-year Crimson Tide run was Alabama 12, Tennessee 10 in 2009 with Kiffin running the Vols. Who knew he was auditioning for a job as Nick Saban's future offensive coordinator? \nCurrent Tennessee coach Butch Jones should be commended for removing much of the debris from the Derek Dooley era, but he's still trying to prove he can lift the Vols to the next level. \nIf it weren't for Fulmer moonlighting as an NCAA investigator to help put Alabama on probation, the Crimson Tide could empathize with its proud former rival. Alabama wandered in the woods for years from Mike DuBose to Dennis Franchione to Mike Price to Mike Shula. The Vols won eight of 10 against the Tide during that lost decade in Tuscaloosa. \nSaban and the revolving door in Knoxville combined to flip the series this way. Nick Saban Press Conference Video, Oct. 19, 2015 Watch Nick Saban's Monday press conference during Tennessee week, Oct. 19, 2015. \nTennessee will cross the state line this weekend with more hope than it's had in years. Beating a wounded Georgia team the week after Alabama walked all over the Dogs was a nice win for the clearly improved Vols, but it wasn't at the top of the bucket list for most UT fans of a certain age. What they'd like to see is another win over Alabama in their lifetimes. \nDon't hold your breath. When it does happen, then you can call this a rivalry and get angry at the color orange. Until then, the operative emotion for Alabama fans to direct toward the UT program isn't hate. \nIt's pity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:32:52.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
