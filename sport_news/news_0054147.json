By ROB OESTERLE roesterle @shawmedia.com \nMORRIS – With one game remaining on the schedule, the Morris football team wants to end on a high note Friday when they visit LaSalle-Peru. The IHSA playoffs are no longer a possibility for the Redskins, who suffered their fifth loss of the season Oct. 16 at Sycamore and will be ineligible for postseason play. Related Links Turnovers key in Morris’ loss to Kaneland \nLaSalle-Peru sports an identical 3-5 record and will also miss the playoffs, but that doesn’t mean Friday night’s game will be just two teams going through the motions to end the season. \n“There’s pride on the line here,” Morris coach Alan Thorson said. “We’re all disappointed with how things have gone, and we’re not happy about where we are at right now. \n“But, we have one game left, and we want to finish the season on the right note. We want to send the seniors out on a high note. It’s their last game, and they don’t need any help getting fired up for it. For the juniors, this is a way for them to take a right step toward getting ready for next year.” \nMorris started the season with a 3-1 record, the only loss coming to Washington, which is currently 8-0, and the Redskins handed 7-1 Sterling its only loss of the year. But consecutive losses to Yorkville, DeKalb, Kaneland and Sycamore have eliminated Morris from the playoffs for the second time in the past three years. \nLaSalle-Peru. meanwhile, had been 1-17 over the previous two seasons entering 2015. The Cavailiers won two of their first three games, and their other win is against Ottawa, who is 4-4. They lost to Kaneland. 31-12, last week. \n“LaSalle-Peru is better than they have been,” Thorson said. “On offense, they have a quarterback that throws the ball well and they have some good skill position players. Their defense is aggressive and flies to the ball. \n“We are certainly in no position to overlook anybody. Even though we are out of the playoffs, we still have something to play for. L-P is improving. This group of juniors they have was 8-1 or 7-2 as sophomores last year, and they have been waiting for this group and expecting big things. I know that this is a big game for them.” \nMorris will be hoping to see improvement from an offense that has struggled in its recent four-game losing streak, having scored just 35 points in those four games. \n“Like I said, this game is about Redskin pride,” Thorson said. “We’d better come ready to play, because I can guarantee that LaSalle-Peru is going to be ready to play.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:47:21.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
