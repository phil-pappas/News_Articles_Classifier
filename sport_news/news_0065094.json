Dickey called it. \nWhen asked prior to Game 3 on Sunday if it felt weird talking about a start that might not even materialize, Dickey feigned a look of shock. \n“In my mind, it’s a certainty,” he said. \nThe Blue Jays’ knuckleballer has been pencilled in as the Game 4 starter — despite debate all weekend that manager John Gibbons might go back to David Price. \nThe trouble was, Dickey wouldn’t have gotten the chance to pitch in the post-season if the Jays lost Game 3. And if they did lose Sunday, his playoff experience with the Blue Jays would have amounted to nothing more than being a glorified cheerleader. \nBut when asked about the uniqueness of the situation and the fact that he might not have gotten the chance to pitch in the playoffs — but had to sit in front of the media and talk about a start that was not certain — Dickey pretended he didn’t understand the premise of the question. \n“Why wouldn’t it happen?” he said, with a smile. \n“I’m just pulling your leg,” he continued a moment later. “You know, I really don’t consider that option (not going to Game 4). I mean, I don’t think anybody in there does, you know. In my mind, it’s a certainty. That’s how I have to behave for the sake of being fully prepared, so I don’t really consider the alternative.” \nFortunately for Dickey, and the Jays, Toronto pulled off a 5-1 win over the Rangers in Game 3 of the ALDS. He’ll go up against Texas lefty Derek Holland (4-3, 4.91 ERA) in Game 4. \nGibbons said prior to Game 3 on Sunday that Dickey would be his man for Game 4 if the Jays made it that far simply because veteran pitcher deserves the start. Dickey went 3-8 the first three months of the season, but finished the last three 8-3. He finished the year with a 3.91 ERA and threw a team best 214.1 innings. \n“He’s had a great year,” said Gibbons. “Maybe a little bit of a slow start and then he really kicked it in. He’s that one guy early on who got zero run support. As many runs that we were scoring, he’s the one guy that was a victim of that. That usually happens to one guy. But you look over the last few months, he’s been great. He’s been on a nice little roll, he’s been one of the better pitchers in baseball. If we get to the point (Monday) and he throws that knuckleball and he’s on, he’s awfully tough to hit.” \nDickey and Gibbons were put in the awkward position Sunday afternoon, being asked to talk about a game that might not happen. It was like walking a tightrope. Gibbons, especially, had to be careful with what he said. Somewhat surprisingly, though, they both seemed sincerely upbeat, despite the club facing elimination after a regular season of great success. Many insiders picked the Jays to win the World Series. Dickey insisted the club was relaxed heading into Game 3, despite the circumstances, joking that everyone was loose and sticking to their routines and “people aren’t meditating in the corners”. \n“I think (Munenori) Kawasaki might help with that a little bit,” he said. \nThe 40-year-old right-hander smiled again when asked about possibly pitching in the playoffs at a place where he started, facing the Texas club that drafted him in the first in 1996. He picked up his first major-league win as a member of the Rangers in 2003. \n“You know, it’s special for sure, and that seems like such a cliche word but it’s funny how it’s come full circle for me personally, having learned the knuckleball here in 2005, and now potentially with a chance to take the series back to Toronto with a Game 4 start,” he said. “It’s poetic, is what it is for me. It’s a neat narrative.” \nDickey said that one of the reasons that he agreed to sign an extension to allow his trade from the New York Mets to the Jays in 2012 was the chance to pitch in the post-season. Imagine how he would have felt if the Jays went to Game 4 and Gibbons chose Price, the Game 1 starter, over Dickey, who heaped praise on Game 3 starter Marco Estrada, who went 61/3, giving up five hits and only one run to get the win on Sunday, basically giving Dickey the chance to pitch in the post-season. \n“I said in Spring Training, in order for us to win a championship, any championship ... you’re going to have to have guys step up that you weren’t necessarily starting on,” said Dickey. “I mean he was close to being a cut in Spring Training and here he is probably one of our top two starters. Then there’s others, though, you’ve got Ryan (Goins) — the list is pretty long on our team which is why I feel like we’ve had so much success. I think Marco has proven to be an incredible asset for us in more ways than just pitching. He’s been so consistent in the clubhouse, you can count on him all the time, he works his tail off, it rubs off on the younger guys, he’s the total package, that’s been fun to be a teammate of his and to get to know him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:38:25.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
