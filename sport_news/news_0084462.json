The move followed the May indictment of 14 soccer officials and marketing executives in the United States for bribery, money laundering and wire fraud.\nPlatini, who like Blatter denies any wrongdoing, was the early frontrunner before the investigation was launched last week. Some European soccer associations backing Platini are also adopting a more cautious approach, awaiting the outcome of that inquiry.\n\"In this time of uncertainty surrounding soccer's world governing body FIFA, it is clear that what is needed, more urgently than ever, is a firm hand to run the world body competently and with a determination to conduct its affairs professionally and with maximum transparency,\" Sheikh Salman said in his statement.\nSTRONG ASIAN CANDIDATES\nThe lack of reference to Platini stands in contrast to Sheikh Salman's fulsome praise for the former French international in August when he said FIFA needed \"experience, wisdom and ability to bring back stability to FIFA.\n\"Mr. Platini boasts such characteristics and has an ambitious vision to renew belief in the organization,\" he said at the time.\nSheikh Salman, a close ally of influential Kuwaiti Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, said his current priority was the AFC.\nAsia already has two hopeful candidates with Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein and South Korean Chung Mong-joon, the 63-year-old billionaire scion of South Korea's Hyundai industrial conglomerate, also bidding.\nUEFA president Platini says the nine year gap between his work for FIFA, which concluded in 2002, and the payment made in 2011 was due to FIFA lacking the funds to pay him.\nPlatini would have to pass an Ethics Committee 'Integrity Check' after submitting his nomination by October 26.\n(Reporting By Simon Evans; editing by Ralph Boulton )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:32:30.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
