The Hornets debuted their ombre pink breast-cancer awareness uniforms on Thursday, and just pulling on the special jerseys was exciting. \nBeing seeded so closely didn't hurt either. The upset seemed tantalizingly close. Senior outside hitter Chino Anukwuem ensured it happened, leading Hanover Park to a 26-24, 27-25 comeback MCT victory. \nAnukwuem quickly became Hornets setter Brittany Monahan's target, finishing with 10 kills, two blocks and five digs. But her mere presence was a source of concern for the host Mustangs. \nFaced with an unfamiliar MCT opponent, they had looked up Hanover Park's past results on the Web â€” which nearly always featured the athletic, 6-foot-2 Anukwuem. A long jumper in the spring, Anukwuem got plenty of air on the court Thursday. \n\"She's super-talented,\" Montville senior middle hitter Riley Henderson said of Anukwuem. \"She jumps, she swings super-hard. I have the utmost respect for her as a player and as an athlete.\" \nDespite all the Hornets' enthusiasm, it was the Mustangs who started out strong, building a quick 15-6 lead. Montville used a diverse offense, as Henderson had nine kills and two blocks, and senior Lexi Goldberg five kills. \nBut youth caught up with the Mustangs, who frequently have four sophomores on the court. Hanover Park, meanwhile, went back to Anukwuem for three of the final four points, plus an ace by senior Nicole Rothenberger. \n\"We came out so strong, so confident, so energetic,\" Henderson said. \"We have trouble keeping up that charisma and that energy. It makes it tough for us to close.\" \nIn the second game, Hanover Park was able to capitalize on a string of Montville errors to close a six-point deficit and take the lead for the first time. After that, the score bounced back and forth, with Goldberg closing out a pair of rallies with kills. \nGoldberg also served an ace that tied the second game at 22, then Hornets coach Megan Wilson called a timeout. Anukwuem responded with a kill, but Henderson tied the score again. Monohan faked a pass and earned her only kill of the match. Anukwuem ended things with an ace. \nMonhan finished with 11 assists. Wilson said Rothenberger, who had three kills and three digs, had her best game based on \"hustle and the way she kept her composure.\" \nHanover Park will play top-seeded and defending champion West Morris in the second round next week. \n\"We realized we were down, but we wanted to win,\" Anukwuem said. \"We hustled more. We were positive. We were loud. We wanted to come back so badly.\" \nStaff Writer Jane Havsy: 973-428-6682; jhavsy@gannettnj.com; www.dailyrecord.com/writerjane/ 37 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dailyre.co/1KQf4HG TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:11:10.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
