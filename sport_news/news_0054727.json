She joins Agnieszka Radwanska, who pulled out Sunday saying she wanted to recover after winning the Tianjin Open. \nIn the men's competition, seventh-seeded Joao Sousa of Portugal went out in the first round, losing 7-6 (2), 4-6, 7-5 to Spain's Daniel Gimeno-Traver. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:00:35.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
