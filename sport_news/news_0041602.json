(Photo: Evan Siegle/Press-Gazette Media) \nSUAMICO — The De Pere football team found the secret to success in the Fox River Classic Conference. \nHis name is Cole Runge. \nThe senior quarterback led the Redbirds to a 26-7 win over Bay Port on Friday night, clinching the outright conference title and completing a perfect regular season. \nThe win continued what started in Week 3 last season, when Runge took over at quarterback for an injured Emmett Kulick. \nHe has gone 16-0 in the regular season since, leading the Redbirds to their first conference championship since 2007 and likely helping to deliver them a No. 1 seed for the WIAA Division 2 playoffs when brackets are released on Saturday. \nDe Pere (9-0) often found a way to beat the weaker teams in the FRCC during Chad Michalkiewicz’s first few seasons as coach, but it could never beat a good one. \nThis year, they beat every single one of them. \n“I’m so proud,” Michalkiewicz said. “You come in with a vision, weight room expectations, offseason 7-on-7 in the summer. These guys answered the bell. Community service, in the classroom, it’s no mistake these guys are champions. They will be champions the rest of their life.” \nRunge, meanwhile, would be the first to point out that De Pere isn’t just his team, which was evident against a Pirates squad that had been 19-0 in true home games in Bay Port coach Gary Westerman’s first four seasons. \nIt also was the first time any FRCC team coached by Westerman lost at home, including the one season he spent at Pulaski in 2011. \nWhile Runge scored two rushing touchdowns, senior running back Nik Ohuafi continued a dominating season by rushing 42 times for 232 yards. \nHe started the year at his customary defensive end position, only to be moved to running back after early-season injuries. This performance, which also included a 10-yard TD pass to Zack Rabas to close out the scoring in the fourth quarter, only helped his FRCC player of the year candidacy. He finished as the league’s rushing champion with 1,639 yards. \nOhuafi put De Pere up 6-0 in the final seconds of the first quarter on a 14-yard touchdown run, which capped a 13-play drive in which every play was either a run by Ohuafi or Runge. \nRunge took his turn in the final seconds of the second quarter after Bay Port missed a 36-yard field goal attempt earlier, running around the left end for an 8-yard TD and then completing a pass to tight end Max Huddleston for a 2-point conversion and a 14-0 lead. \nThe score was set up thanks to an interception by De Pere defensive back Connor Kupsh, who jumped a route and picked off a Quinn Pierner pass attempt at the Bay Port 34. \nThat came just two plays after a big hit by Bay Port defensive back Jake Weber forced an Ohuafi fumble to give the Pirates the ball. \n“We had a bunch of mistakes early,” Westerman said. “We had the ball down on the 20 or 15, and we get a holding penalty. Went to kick a field goal and it was long. We moved the ball, and then we had a turnover. \n“We just struggled to get consistency and we made too many mistakes to score.” \nDe Pere added to its lead with 2 minutes, 46 seconds left in the third quarter on a 1-yard TD run by Runge that made it 20-0. \nBay Port (7-2) finally got something going with backup quarterback Brett Frieder, who replaced Pierner in the second half. \nFrieder completed a 35-yard pass to the De Pere 1 on his second drive, before Evan Bindas scored on a TD run with 1:33 remaining in the third. \nIt would be as close as the Pirates would get, because they hardly got the ball back. \nDe Pere started a possession with 10:05 left, and took the next 7:30 off the clock on a 16-play 65-yard drive that featured two fourth down conversions and ended with the TD pass from Ohuafi. \nGame over. \nDe Pere will now prepare for what it hopes is a strong postseason run led in part by a quarterback who almost never loses. \n“If you have got guys like the guys we have, I don’t know, I feel like it was possible,” Runge said of his team’s impressive regular-season winning streak. “The way we came together last season, that translated so well this year. \n“We have got a team that just never quits.” \nDe Pere 6 8 6 6 – 26 \nBay Port 0 0 7 0 – 7 \nFirst quarter \nDP: Nik Ohuafi 14 run (run failed). \nSecond quarter \nDP: Cole Runge 6 run (Max Huddleston catch). \nThird quarter \nDP: Runge 1 run (run failed) \nBP: Evan Bindas 1 run (Josh Jennerjohn kick). \nFourth quarter \nDP: Zack Rabas 10 pass from Ohuafi (run failed). \nRushing – BP: Pierner 13-36; DP: Ohuafi 42-232. \nPassing – BP: Pierner 3-11-69.
