Here's five things that A&M fans should know about Mississippi State.\nRecord: 3-1, 1-1 in SEC\nLast: Defeated Auburn, 17-9, on Sept. 26\nKey number: Zero: Mississippi State has allowed zero touchdowns in the fourth quarter so far this season and a total of just six points. Texas A&M has allowed 27 total points in the fourth quarter this year.\n1. Last time out: The No. 21 Mississippi State Bulldogs got their first win in conference play last week with a victory over the Auburn Tigers at Jordan-Hare. Senior quarterback Dak Prescott completed 29 of his 41 passing attempts for the Bulldogs for 270 yards and two scores.\nJunior running back Brandon Holloway took five carries for 42 yards, however the Bulldogs managed just 56 yards total on the ground on 21 carries. Fred Ross caught a team-high seven passes in the victory over Auburn while Junior De'Runnya Wilson and sophomore Gabe Myles accounted for the touchdown receptions.\nNow ranked fourth in the SEC West, a victory on Saturday would keep Mississippi State on track after dropping its opening conference contest to LSU.\n2. Dak will be key: Dak Prescott scored five total touchdowns (2 passing, 3 rushing) against the Aggies last season in a 48-31 victory in Starksville.\nThis season, he has yet to throw an interception, but has managed 1,069 yards and seven touchdowns through the air. With 33 career rushing touchdowns, he is always a threat to pull it down and run should the defense leave some daylight.\nThe A&M secondary hasn't truly been tested to this point in the season, but most certainly will be Friday as the senior QB attempts to pick them apart.\nThere is plenty of talent on the Bulldog roster, but stopping Dak will go a long way in claiming victory. Failure could represent the main reason why the Aggies suffer defeat.\n3. Speeding things up: Last week, Texas A&M managed just 16 snaps in the first half against Arkansas and stand at a total of 282 snaps on the year.\nBoth Auburn and LSU, Mississippi' State's previous conference opponents this year, also have favored the run over the pass. The Bulldogs have gotten off 263 plays in 2015 to this point, and like A&M, rely heavily on the passing game. Both teams should see a noticeable jump in the plays called this weekend and you can expect to see plenty of passing.\nDefenses will need to remain on their toes, especially in the secondary. Both quarterbacks possess the ability to take advantage of mistakes with both their arm as well as their legs and will be looking for any opportunity they can to score.\n4. Texas ties: When the Bulldogs and No. 14 Aggies kick off at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, a couple players as well as coaches will be returning home to the Lone Star State.\nFred Ross has a team leading 219 yards and 22 receptions and arrived at MSU out of John Tyler High School in Tyler. Also from Tyler is redshirt freshman defensive end Will Coleman.\nTexas ties exist with the coaching staff as well. MSU quarterback coach Brian Johnson is a native of Baytown while RB coach Greg Knox is a native of Rosebud.\n5. It's been a while: The last time Mississippi State entered College Station and left with a victory was in 1913 after a 6-0 victory.\nSince the Aggies arrived in the SEC, they claim a 2-1 series advantage, but the Bulldogs have an opportunity to even things up on Saturday. A&M hasn't defeated a ranked opponent at home since 2011 (Baylor) as a member of the Big 12.\nA victory on Saturday will be Mullen's 50th with MSU, good for third-all time with the program. Former A&M coach Jackie Sherrill ranks first with 75 and is trailed by Allyn McKeen with 65.\nMullen has managed just a 6-26 mark against ranked opponents during his time with the Bulldogs, and claims a 3-10 mark on the road.\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland"], "published": "2015-10-01T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:44:00.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
