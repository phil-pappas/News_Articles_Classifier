Comment By Jared Keene/Daily News Staff MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA By Jared Keene/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 11:36 PM Updated at 11:37 PM By Jared Keene/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 11:36 PM Updated at 11:37 PM LOWELL — If you blinked, or happened to look away for a brief second, you easily could have missed it. In front of a primarily pro-Danny O’Connor crowd, Gabriel “Tito” Bracero sent the Framingham resident to the ground with a vicious overhand right counterpunch just 41 seconds into the first round. O’Connor was knocked out by the blow, giving the Brooklyn, New York-based fighter a knockout victory in the 147-pound Welterweight Main Event of the Premier Boxing Champions on Saturday night at the Lowell Memorial Auditorium. “That was the plan,” Bracero (24-2, 5 KOs), who handed O’Connor his first professional defeat back in 2011, said of going after his left-handed opponent with an early right hand. “In my last fight, I fought a southpaw and I felt like I made a few mistakes and didn’t prepare properly. So I’ve been in camp specifically working on these punches. “With him being a southpaw, I had to step out to the left side and come with the right hand and while I come with the right, I’m leaning more on my outer foot. (The punch) landed and it worked. I’ve been training day in and day out and I’m just so humble and grateful.” After the fight was called, O’Connor laid on the mat for several minutes as medical personnel attended to him. O’Connor was communicating with the medical personnel and briefly stood up before leaving the arena and heading to a local hospital. O’Connor did not speak with the media following the fight. O’Connor drops to 26-3 with 10 knockouts in his career. The Framingham pugilist was coming off a TKO victory over Michael Clark in May at Agganis Arena, his third straight win since a brief retirement. With O’Connor set out to try and redeem himself against Bracero, he threw a couple of punches prior to the knockout, but never made significant contact. Then, after O’Connor tried throwing a left, Bracero threw the right that ended the match. And according to Bracero, he felt no sense of pressure, especially knowing that O’Connor was the one fighting in front of his local crowd. “I knew coming in here that all the pressure was on him,” Bracero said. “I had no pressure. My pressure was just to come in here and make noise and being that it was a home crowd for him, that home crowd just brought the beast out of me. I already knew from the beginning that all the pressure was going to be on him. “I had my last fight in front of my hometown crowd and took a loss. After I took that loss, I was depressed because I lost in front my home crowd. I knew I was coming in here to win.” Page 2 of 2 - Bracero certainly didn’t plan on beating O’Connor the way he did, but beyond that, the win meant a lot to the 34-year old. “I’ve been through so much in life and this today was a dream,” he said. “It was a vision I had for a very long time, so it was a dream come true. I sacrifice so much year-round. Sometimes, I’m not able to be with my two kids because I’m always working, training, and sacrificing. Again, I’m just grateful and I’m humbled.” The victory was big for Bracero, who has high aspirations about his boxing career moving forward. “The win still really hasn’t sunk in yet,” he said. “I feel like I just walked in there and walked right back out. I’m happy and I’m ready to climb the ladder from here to whatever is next. I want to chase a world title, you know. I want to become champion of the world, that’s my dream.” In the night’s first two televised bouts, Quincy’s Ryan Kielczewski won by unanimous decision over Rafael Vazquez and Jonathan Guzman knocked out Danny Aquino in the ninth round.
