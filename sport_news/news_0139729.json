(NBA Preview)", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "There's a video floating around the internet of Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James turning his ankle. \nThe injury looks brutal, like most ankle sprains — James takes a bad step toward Derrick Rose, brings his left foot down on Rose's foot and crumples to the floor. The replay shows the damage, as James' ankle bends like rubber and most of 249 pounds came down on an ankle facing the floor. James, understandably, crumples and holds his leg. \nThen, impossibly, James gets back up. He limps toward the bench and finishes the game, playing his requisite 43 minutes and nearly putting up a triple-double with 25 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists. \nThe performance appeared barely human, which frankly makes sense, since James is barely mortal. \nThat resilience to injury has been part of what has made James so incredible over the years — injuries that would sideline a lesser player (and might hospitalize the everyday pick-up player) seem to slide off his back. Sure, at times, reports trickle out that he \"needed treatment\" or that he is \"questionable\" for some reason or another, but to this point, James' body has never given out on him. \nThe hope of every NBA fan — at least, every NBA fan who enjoys watching professional basketball at an incredibly high level — is that James will be healthy throughout this season (and if you hope something else, sincerely, re-evaluate how and why you watch sports). But at some point, physics will begin to take their toll. The list of LeBron's knicks and bruises is lengthy , and after a while, those bruises will become more and more serious. It's well established that James has a lot of miles on his 30-year-old body, and even a finely tuned body like James' will break down eventually. \nWill that break down happen this season? One hopes not. It's a real question, however: How long can James continue to hold off challengers for his crown as indisputably the greatest player in the world? Stephen Curry and James Harden were both better MVP candidates during the 2014-15 regular season, but as James demonstrated in the playoffs, nobody can drag a team further single-handedly than he can. \nThat might not be the case for much longer. Anthony Davis led the league in PER (30.8) and blocked shots last season, while putting up 24.4 points on 53.5 percent shooting in addition to 10.2 rebounds... all at just 21 years old for most of the season. Davis led the Pelicans to a first-round playoff appearance, and while they were bounced pretty easily by the eventual-champion Warriors, NBA observers might remember when Oklahoma City made a precocious first-round playoff appearance, lost to the eventual-champion Lakers, and advanced to the Western Conference Finals the year after. \nThe Thunder, of course, had more than just Kevin Durant — they also had Russell Westbrook, Harden and Serge Ibaka. Playoff experience matters, however, and if the Pelicans learned anything from their first taste of real success, they'll be able to apply it this season. \nMeanwhile, Oklahoma City will once again have the opportunity to make a deep playoff run. It's been more than a year since we've seen a truly healthy Durant — he played 27 games last year but was clearly limited throughout the season — so it's easy to forget just how deadly he is. \nForgetting would be a mistake. Durant is finally at the age where he should be entering his prime — one year removed from putting up an absolutely absurd 32 points per game while nearly accomplishing the difficult 50/40/90 (50 percent from the field, 40 percent from 3, 90 percent from the free-throw line) milestone that is rarely accomplished by a volume scorer. As worrisome as foot injuries are, especially for a near 7-footer like Durant, his skill is undeniable. \nDurant and Davis are just the peak of the wave, but a host of talented players trail them. Westbrook, Curry and Harden were all MVP candidates last season (and Curry, of course, was the MVP winner). Young guns like Andrew Wiggins are looking to break through. Chris Paul and Blake Griffin might be the two best players at their respective positions and — frighteningly — also happen to play on the same team. DeMarcus Cousins and John Wall are two of the best prospects at their own position, and they are approaching their primes as well. \nAnd yet, Durant, Davis, Westbrook, Curry, Harden, Griffin, Paul and Wiggins are all still chasing LeBron. He remains the benchmark for every NBA player — an 11-time All-Star in his 12 th season, a four-time MVP and a two-time champion. He dragged otherwise bad teams to the Finals, survived focused hatred from fans and overcame the ridiculous \"but is he clutch, though?\" narrative that hounded him, and through it all, to many fans' consternation, he remained the most dominant player in the league. \nThe starpower in today's NBA is overwhelming, and as a result the league is in an excellent place. But for as long as James is the greatest, it's worth remembering to appreciate exactly what we are watching: A seemingly indestructible player with a combination of speed, strength, skill and basketball IQ previously unheard of in professional basketball. \nAt some point, someone — Durant, Davis or someone nobody saw coming — is going to overtake LeBron James, and when they do, they'll be overtaking one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history. Cheer for or hate him all you want, but if you enjoy basketball, that makes this year's edition of LeBron James eminently worth watching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:11:23.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
