And guaranteed a minimum of 39 points (opponents’ combined wins), the climb back from a 2-4 record to a postseason spot is nearly complete. \n“The last three weeks have been playoff weeks for us because it’s do or die,” Trojans coach John Wander said. “I see us getting better. We have a lot of young kids on defense, and that’s what we’re going to preach – keep getting better and who knows what can happen.” \nMaking things happen offensively is the alternating quarterback tandem of Brandon Bancoro and Quinn McAnally. The strategy started three weeks ago with Bancoro’s return from injury and reached new heights Oct. 16 as Bancoro scored on touchdown runs of 3 and 4 yards. \n“Quinn McAnally can throw, I’ll run, and it’s just a great duo we have going,” Bancoro said. \nBancoro’s first touchdown put the Trojans up 10-0, but York seized momentum late in the first half. \nThe Dukes’ 64-yard drive was highlighted by Lucas Alexander runs of 23 and 18 yards and capped by quarterback Johnny DiCanio’s 2-yard touchdown dive that made it 10-7 with 1:54 left before halftime. \nThe Trojans couldn’t answer before intermission, and York opened the second half with a drive to the North 29-yard line. \nA blitz by North’s Joseph Ward resulted in an interception by Tyler Wicks, whose 35-yard return to the York 40 set up the deciding score. \n“Our coaches were telling us we needed a turnover, a big play,” Wicks said. “I was spying the quarterback. I saw the lineman coming up, and the tight end I believe was coming around. I took an opportunity and I got it.” \nConnor Olson caught passes of 20 yards from Bancoro and 15 yards from McAnally on the drive, which ended with a Bancoro touchdown run and a 17-7 lead with 4:20 left in the third quarter. \nIn a must-win game of its own, York again responded. A 77-yard drive was capped by a DiCanio to Matthew Reicker 10-yard touchdown pass that made it 17-13 with 10:06 to play. \nThe Dukes’ defense twice stopped Downers North drives inside the 30, and Sam Rasnic’s fumble recovery at the York 20-yard line with 1:06 left gave York one last chance for a win. \nOn fourth-and-1 with 25 seconds left, an interception by the Trojans’ Zack Figura sealed the verdict. \n“It’s teamwork,” Bancoro said. “I believe our offense kind of carried the first half. We were very dominant. I think York had like six minutes of offense [possession time]. But it was all about the fourth-quarter stands by our defense. I really messed up fumbling the ball, but our defense bailed me out. I can count on them to do that.” \n“If we want to keep going, we have to keep winning, so it’s a huge win,” Wicks said. “Now we have to focus on the next one.” \n– \nWho: Downers Grove North at Proviso West \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Oct. 23 \nWhere: 4701 Harrison St., Hillside \nRecords: DGN 4-4 (1-4 WSS), PW 1-7 (0-5) \nOutlook: A win in this West Suburban Silver game would give the Trojans a fifth win that would make them eligible for the playoffs. The Panthers have struggled much of the season. They have been shut out three times and their only win came against winless Proviso East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:13:49.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
