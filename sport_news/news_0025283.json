Speaking to reporters Wednesday, defensive coordinator Billy Davis did not sound optimistic he would play against the Giants.\n\"Kendricks is day-to-day,\" Davis said.\nAgholor, meanwhile, missed his first practice since being drafted by the Eagles in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft. The rookie is suffering from a muscle injury in his left leg , an injury Agholor said is causing him pain in his shin.\nAgholor was sporting a noticeable limp as he walked onto the practice field without his helmet.\nBRADFORD: Report card from win over Saints Offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur did not have an update for the media on Agholor prior to practice. His status for the team's game against the Giants seems very much up in the air. If the rookie can't play, the Eagles will likely give increased snaps to receivers Josh Huff and Miles Austin.\nIn addition to Kendricks and Agholor, defensive end Brandon Bair (quad) and inside linebacker Kiko Alonso (knee) were also both out. It is unclear how close either are to returning, but it seems unlikely they will play against the Giants.", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCIQqQIwAmoVChMI7rH16rLCyAIVQxk-Ch0qgQ4X&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nj.com%2Feagles%2Findex.ssf%2F2015%2F10%2Feagles_nelson_agholor_to_undergo_mri_on_left_leg_m.html&usg=AFQjCNH112RJHq9FDvVsK2cnPf7MYJvYKg&sig2=V2yMLjMEup7g5GRYProquA&bvm=bv.104819420,d.cWw"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:13:02.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
