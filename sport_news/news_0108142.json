(Mike Stobe / Getty Images) Dylan Hernandez and Bill Shaikin Contact Reporters \nDon Mattingly will no longer be the manager of the Dodgers, The Times confirmed on Thursday. \nWith Mattingly as manager, the Dodgers won three consecutive National League West championships for the first time in franchise history, but even with baseball's biggest payroll the club never advanced to the World Series, losing in the division series twice and league championship series once. \nA person with knowledge of negotiations between the Dodgers and Mattingly, who still had one year remaining on his contract, said the parting was amicable and mutual. \nMattingly managed the Dodgers for five seasons, accumulating an overall record of 446-363, a .551 winning percentage. \nMattingly wishes to continue managing, a person close to him said Thursday morning. The Miami Marlins are looking for a manager and are known to be interested. The San Diego Padres, Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners also have managing vacancies.

Chicago Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez and former Padres manager Bud Black are also considered possibilities. \nThe details of his split with the Dodgers are unclear. The team is expected to officially announce the decision later today, according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports, who first reported the move. \nMattingly was known to have a good relationship with controling owner Mark Walter and he seemed to go along with the analytically based decisions made by first-year baseball boss Andrew Friedman and general manager Farhan Zaidi. \nContrary to media reports that Mattingly turned down the club's offer of an extension, a person with knowledge of the situation said no formal offer was ever made because the sides agreed to part ways before the negotiations went that far. \nMattingly received a contract extension in 2014 after he expressed frustration about the possibility he would have to guide the team as a lame duck. \n\"Really what it does, it puts me in a spot where everything I do is questioned because I'm basically trying out or auditioning to say, 'Can he manage or can he not manage?' To me, it's at that point where, three years in, you either know or don't.\" \nMORE ON THE DODGERS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:06:30.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
