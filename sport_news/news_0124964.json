The Houston-based developers plans, as outlined last month to Invest Atlanta at the time, call for more than 380 apartments, 20 townhouses, nearly a quarter-million square feet each of office and retail space, a grocer and 250 condominiums. The Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center will be razed as part of the redevelopment.\nRenderings of Weingarten Realty’s design concept for the redevelopment of the Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center in Midtown includes apartments over retail, townhomes, office space and a park with an amphitheater.

The updated site plans could include different configurations of the buildings and additional office space.\nA park with events space remains central to the project.\n“The site plans are evolving,” Coats said. “The green space/park area is central to our plan and will be in the center of the project.”\nRenderings of Weingarten Realty’s design concept for the redevelopment of the Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center in Midtown includes apartments over retail, townhomes, office space and a park with an amphitheater.
