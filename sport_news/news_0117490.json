Its Eli even though he sucks — John Turner (@QBTurner7) October 21, 2015 @RealSidSaraf @NFLonFOX Has to be Eli Manning right? beat em in 2 superbowls... #FoxMailbag — mike jordan (@mjordan1000) October 21, 2015 @RealSidSaraf @NFLonFOX has to be Eli. The only one to best Tom in the SB's — SR (@Rigzard) October 21, 2015 \nLet's break this down. Eli Manning differs from Luke Skywalker in many ways. Eli was raised by his real parents in a stable home and never made out with a sibling (that we know of). He doesn't skip his chores to waste time with his friends at the Toshi station and never gets cocky. \nBy the way, did I mention that Eli never made out with a sibling?! Why does everyone gloss over this? LUKE MADE OUT WITH HIS SISTER. AND ENJOYED IT! EWWWW! \nEli Manning has also never suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of his main rival. Luke Skywalker had his hand chopped off by Darth Vader before he was ultimately victorious. \nHowever, there is one thing that can bond Eli and Luke together. If the Giants were to reach the Super Bowl and somehow beat the Patriots again, I can guarantee that Tom Brady (Darth) would pick up Bill Belichick (Emperor) by the neck and throw him down a giant shaft like so: true \nLet's face it, that's the only way this Patriots dynasty is going to end. It has to collapse from within. Maybe Eli is the man to do it. \nWE PAUSE THESE PROCEEDINGS . . . \n. . . For the nerdiest (and most awesome) conversation that has ever lived on FOXSports.com. It started innocently enough, when I posted this week's topic on Twitter and two dudes began to have a conversation. true", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:13:53.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
