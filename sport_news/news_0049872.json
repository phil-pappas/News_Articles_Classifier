Every week in NBA 2K16’s My Team mode, there are Throwback Thursday cards released with highlight seasons. Each week here on Operation Sports, I’ll be showing you stats, badges, individual attributes, and everything related to each player. If you pull one of these cards, you’ll know what to do with them. Let’s get to it. 2002 Jason Terry, Atlanta Hawks Jason Terry switched from point guard to shooting guard and found his niche as a young starter with the Atlanta Hawks, and what a transition it’s been! Terry averaged 19 points per game on 43 percent field goal shooting and 38 percent from deep, proving his mettle as a scorer. You should use Terry on your My Team the way he’s used now in the NBA—a fantastic spark plug for your second unit. You may find some players that are better all-around, but “The Jet” will get your offense going in a hurry, especially if the opponent doesn’t remember his card. 2003 Caron Butler, Miami Heat Butler’s rookie season brought solid numbers for a first year, with 15 points and 5 rebounds per game, albeit on 41 percent shooting. This card won’t be in high demand, and unless you’re familiar with Butler as a player, may not be the most useful. Butler’s better days were with the Wizards. In the game, there are better options at Butler’s tier, although he does have a pretty simple jump shot to learn. 2008 Carmelo Anthony, Denver Nuggets One of the most highly anticipated cards of My Team arrives this week in the form of Denver's Carmelo Anthony. Anthony averaged 25 points and 7 rebounds per game for the Nuggets in 2008, earning an All-Star appearance for his efforts. His card is a 90 overall rating, putting him in the Amethyst class and making him one of the best players available. If you’re lucky enough to pull this card, remember that Melo’s strength is in his shooting and size. He won’t posterize opponents, but if he’s left open, he’s deadly. 2012 Brandon Jennings, Milwaukee Bucks Jennings is most remembered for his 55-point outburst during his rookie season. He’s followed that with mixed results and is currently on the injured list while recovering from a torn ACL. Jennings can score and has speed, and this version of the card reflects that. Beware, however, as Jennings averaged 19 points and 5 assists per game during the 2012 season reflected on this card. The number that is a bit concerning is his 41 percent field goal mark. Jennings is a volume shooter and scoring point guard. He may be a sneaky value as a Silver player, but make sure you get him for cheap and head to Freestyle mode with him first. That’s it for this week. If you’d like to see the players in-game, be on the lookout for more videos, and if you have any questions I can be reached on Twitter @twobrosgaming .
