(AP Photo/Bruce Crummy, File) \nFARGO, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota State on Tuesday confirmed that starting quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a wrist injury during Saturday’s game against South Dakota. The extent of the injury was not immediately known. \nWentz had a medical appointment scheduled, and the school planned to release more details later in the day, Bison athletic department spokesman Ryan Perreault said. \nPerreault said Wentz suffered the injury in the team’s 24-21 loss to USD on Saturday in Fargo, but he did not elaborate. \nNDSU is the four-time defending Football Championship Subdivision champion. The Bison are 4-2 this season and ranked No. 8 in both national polls after the upset loss to the Coyotes ended NDSU’s 26-game home winning streak. \nWentz, a 6-foot-6, 235-pound senior from Bismarck, is a two-year starter. His backup is redshirt freshman Easton Stick of Omaha, Nebraska. \nIn six games this season, Wentz has thrown for 1,454 yards — an average of about 242 per game — with 16 touchdowns and two interceptions. He also has rushed for 215 yards and four scores. \nLast season, he threw for 3,111 yards and 25 touchdowns, with 10 interceptions, and set NDSU single-season records for passing attempts, completions, yards and total offense. He scored the winning touchdown in last season’s FCS championship game in which the Bison downed Illinois State 29-27 and was named most valuable player. \nNDSU travels to Indiana State (4-2) on Saturday. The Sycamores are ranked No. 18 and No. 21 in the two national polls.
