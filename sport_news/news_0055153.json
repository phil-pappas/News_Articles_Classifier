Golf fans and even professionals were quick to take to social media to criticise the rules. \n\nFormer US team member Keegan Bradley said on Twitter: \"How can you lose a hole twice???! #ussgarules #wow\" \n\nOne Twitter user, Ari Marcus, said: \"So apparently you can lose a hole twice now... How can any match be closed out early now? i.e. How can you lose 2&1 if this is possible?\" \n\nAnother, Matt Blackly, tweeted: \"Yet again the rules of golf are as clear as mud and destined to turn people away from the game! #Simplify it.\" \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:54:12.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
