I think the language is prettier sounding than Spanish.\nQ: Could you carry on a conversation with someone from France?\nA: Definitely. We’ve had speaking tests and my French teacher says I’ve been phenomenal. I have apps on my phone to learn more every day. I’m on the trial version of Rosetta Stone for French. In French IV, we’re required to speak solely French. I would be interested in becoming a translator for a career. I would be happy teaching, too. Translating, though, would be more lucrative.\nQ: What other courses are you involved in?\nA: I’m in pre-calculus, AP biology, symphonic choir, honors English 12 and sociology. I’m challenging myself. Sometimes I can go home and relax, but most of the time I just continue schoolwork.\nQ: You have a job, too?\nA: I’m a crew leader at Dairy Queen. Technically, I’m a manager. I’ve been working there for two years. I oversee what is happening. Most of the time I’m in the back (where food is being prepared), but I can do any job. My older sister, Brin, worked there eight years. Another sister, Abby, worked there. They were good workers, and that helped me get a job. Brin is 24 years old and Abby is19. Another sister, Stefani, a freshman, works there right now. We could open a franchise (smiling). Stefani is great. She listens. I’m not scared of being firm with people. I can’t let people slack off. It’s a great environment. I’m used to leadership because I’ve been track captain for three years. This is my first year as a cross country captain.\nQ: What has been the strangest order at Dairy Queen?\nA: A man came in and got an extra-large Blizzard. He put so many things in the cup — Snickers, M&M’s, Butter Fingers, strawberries, pineapple — the strangest things every. He told me to surprise him, and I did. It cost him about $18. There was ice cream in there, but it was mostly candy. I think he enjoyed it.\nQ: What goes into being a good sports captain?\nA: You must motivate people. There are teammates who might get down, and you must bring them up. I lead stretching. I guess you are the mom of the team in making sure everybody is where they need to be. There’s a lot of leadership by example. One day the younger girls will be leaders, and right now they are looking at what I do.\nQ: Why running?\nA: I used to play soccer as a freshman, but broke an arm when I got pushed down. I wasn’t allowed to play with a cast on, so I concentrated on running. I enjoyed it and just decided to make it my sport. I run to feel better. I do think it helps make me a better person.\nQ: Are you involved in any other activities?\nA: I’ve been in symphonic choir since sophomore year. I’m a soprano. We have two concerts a year at school and have contests. We qualified for state last year. I’m an aide for the French I class. If the teacher needs help, I do it. I grade papers and tutor students who need instruction.\nQ: Where does your seriousness come from?\nA: My dad, Steve Dillon. He’s a carpenter. He told me to get your work done first and to play later. He’s amazing at what he does for a living. My father is strict, but he has our trust. (Smiling) he just knows when you are being honest with him. It’s just expected to get your homework done first. There are six in our family. Ramah is 30 and Bob is 22. I’m right in the middle. We’ve never really had a full house (because of the age disparity). I enjoy having a big family. There’s a large support system.\nQ: Do you volunteer?\nA: I used to volunteer with our church. I also was a coach for fourth, fifth and sixth-graders in track.\nQ: You have 11 varsity letters?\nA: Cross country, academics and track this year will make 14 letters in all. I have two for symphonic, choir and three each for cross country, track and academics. I’m No. 12 academically in my class. I don’t have a letter jacket, but I’m going to frame the letters after I graduate.\nmznidar@dispatch.com\n@MarkZnidar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:43:40.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
