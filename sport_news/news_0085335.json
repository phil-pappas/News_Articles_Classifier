And yes, it had playoff implications for both teams. \nBut that’s not why it was the biggest game of the season for Ricky Scott and Javante Alexander. \nIt was bigger to those two because it was the first time the former Carver stars faced their old team since transferring to crosstown rival Park Crossing. Selected as captains for the game, the pair shook hands with players they shared a locker room with last year. \n“As soon as I got to Park Crossing, from Day 1 everybody was talking about this game,” Scott said. “Seeing it all unravel today, it’s like a dream. I couldn’t picture another way.” \nWith Scott laying big hits at linebacker, and Alexander paving the way on the offensive line, Park Crossing defeated Carver 48-27 on Friday night, winning the first Crosstown Showdown trophy. \n“It was very emotional. It was kind of an uncanny feeling seeing those guys from the other side,” Scott said. “It was a night that I’ll never forget.” \nThe Thunderbirds (7-1, 5-0 Class 6A, Region 2) bounced back from an early touchdown deficit to break the game open with 27 straight points. The 330-pound Alexander helped the Park Crossing offense rack up 547 yards, a product of coming in with something to prove. \n“I had butterflies at first. But I just came out, played my game, kept the team up the whole game and came out victorious,” Alexander said. “I knew guys were going to come at me hard. So I had to come out even harder.” \nPark Crossing quarterback Malik Cunningham threw four touchdowns and ran for another in the victory. He completed 15 of 25 passes for 241 yards, and added 63 rushing yards on 14 carries. \nThree of Cunningham’s touchdowns went to Memphis commit Jahod Booker, who caught eight passes 162 yards. Running back Kavaris Thomas and Akeem Dudley each added rushing touchdowns. Ladarian Field caught an 18-yard touchdown. \nSouth Carolina commit P.J. Blue grabbed an interception to halt Carver’s comeback effort. After the Wolverines cut the deficit to 34-27, Blue’s pick set up a Thomas touchdown to give the Thunderbirds some breathing room. \nIt was a sigh of relief for Park Crossing coach Smitty Grider. \n“We know how to make it interesting, that’s for sure,” Grider said. “This game has been looming since last year, and we put ourselves in a position to make this game important. Not just a rivalry game. To get it behind us, and to get a win, it’s a big relief.” \nCarver’s three-star receiver Xavier Lane led the offense, grabbing nine passes for 213 yards and a touchdown. Justin Lewis had 17 carries for 102 yards and two touchdowns. \nCornerback Addison Coleman returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown. \nThe Wolverines (3-3, 3-2) host Dothan next Thursday with their playoff lives in the balance. \n“It’s a must-win game for us Thursday. We control our own destiny, which is always good, talking about the playoffs. We just have to get back to the drawing board and get our guys ready for Thursday night,” Carver coach Billy Gresham said. “It’s a must-win situation for us, and we’ve been here before. Last year, we were in a similar situation with the Dothan game. We reminded the guys after the game. Either we’re going to be all in, and let’s get to the playoffs, or are we going to kind of lay down and end the season?” Buy Photo Park Crossing players hold their trophy for winning the first-ever Heritage Crosstown Showdown, sponsored by Heritage Barbershop.
