Competitors include Latvia’s Maris Strombergs – who clinched the men’s gold medals at the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Games – and Colombia’s Mariana Pajon, who won the women’s gold medal in London, reports Xinhua. Also present will be current world champions Niek Kimmann of the Netherlands and Stefany Hernandez of Venezuela. “All of the leading competitors in the world will be here,” said Jorge Vasquez, Rio 2016’s BMX sport manager. “We will have all of the top 10 in the men’s world rankings and nine of the top 10 women. And they will need all of their ability because this course we have built is the biggest in the history of the sport in the Olympic Games and is extremely technical.” Located at Deodoro Olympic Park, the 400m course was designed by American Tom Ritzenthaler, who was also responsible for the Beijing and London tracks. The qualifying rounds will be held on Saturday before the knockout stages and medal races on Sunday. It will be the 12th Rio 2016 test event and the first at Deodoro’s X-Park, which will also host mountain bike on October 11 and canoe slalom on November 26-29.
