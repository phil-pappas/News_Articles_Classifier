But football is still king, and there will be plenty to feast your eyes upon, with five matchups of top-25 college teams Saturday and an NFL Sunday quadruple-header starting at 6:30 a.m., when the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets square off in London.\nThe 10 a.m. games will feature the Kansas City Chiefs at Cincinnati Bengals and the Philadelphia Eagles at Washington Redskins, followed by the Green Bay Packers at San Francisco 49ers at 1 p.m. and the Dallas Cowboys at New Orleans Saints on \"Sunday Night Football.\"\nTODAY\nLos Angeles Angels at Texas Rangers (5 p.m., ESPN (30), FSW (49)): The Rangers on Thursday clinched a postseason bid and reduced their magic number to one to win the American League West. The Angels are a game behind Houston in the race for the AL's second wild-card berth.\nBEST OF REST: College football: Connecticut at Brigham Young (7:15 p.m., ESPN2 (31)), Memphis at South Florida (4 p.m., ESPN2 (31)); NBA preseason: Denver Nuggets at Los Angeles Clippers (7:30 p.m., Prime (50), NBA (318)).\nSATURDAY\nNo. 13 Alabama at No. 8 Georgia (12:30 p.m., CBS (8)): The Crimson Tide is an underdog for the first time in six years, but the Bulldogs, favored by 2½ points, can't be too confident heading into this Southeastern Conference showdown between the hedges. Georgia was ranked No. 1 in 2008 when it was whipped by Alabama at home and, more recently, it suffered a heartbreaking loss to the Tide in the 2012 SEC title game.\nNo. 6 Notre Dame at No. 12 Clemson (5:05 p.m., ABC (13)): The Irish, who are 4-0 despite losing six key players to season-ending injuries, had lost five straight road games before pulling out a last-second 34-27 victory at Virginia in September. The Tigers have won 11 straight in Death Valley.\nBEST OF REST: College football: No. 23 West Virginia at No. 15 Oklahoma (9 a.m., FS1 (329)), No. 3 Mississippi at No. 25 Florida (4 p.m., ESPN (30)), No. 21 Mississippi State at No. 14 Texas A&M (4:30 p.m., SEC (335)).\nSUNDAY\nKansas City Chiefs at Cincinnati Bengals (10 a.m., CBS (8)): The Bengals are one of the NFL's seven remaining unbeatens — and one of only three perfect AFC teams, along with the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos — and are trying to go 4-0 for the first time since 2005.\nQuarterback Andy Dalton (eight touchdowns, one interception) is off to his best start, and A.J. Green had 227 yards receiving and two TDs in Sunday's 28-24 win at Baltimore.\nGreen Bay Packers at San Francisco 49ers (1 p.m., Fox (5)): The Niners have ended two of the Packers' past three seasons and won four straight in the series but are coming off their most lopsided loss in 10 years, a 47-7 defeat to the Arizona Cardinals. Green Bay (3-0) is rolling behind Aaron Rodgers (10 TDs, 0 INTs), who fired five touchdown passes in Monday's 38-28 win over Kansas City.\nBEST OF REST: MLB: Los Angeles Angels at Texas Rangers (noon, TBS (7), FSW (49)); NFL: New York Jets vs. Miami Dolphins (6:30 a.m., CBS (8)), Philadelphia Eagles at Washington Redskins (10 a.m., Fox (5)), Dallas Cowboys at New Orleans Saints (5:20 p.m., NBC (3)).\nContact reporter Todd Dewey at tdewey@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0354.
