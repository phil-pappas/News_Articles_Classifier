It's also illegal in Washington, D.C.\nBut it still happens. Leelah Alcorn , the transgender 17-year-old from Ohio who committed suicide in December, is one of the more public — and tragic — examples.\nThe goal of the report, Wolff said, is threefold.\n\"One is to inform further research on this, in terms of trying to study family factors to learn why parents take their child for conversion therapy and how we might work with parents and guardians around this issue,\" he said. \"The second, from a policy perspective, is to get more states to make it explicitly illegal to use conversion therapy on minors. The third is for clinicians and individuals who work with families to have a better grasp on why this is harmful.\"\nSupport and acceptance from family members is directly linked to greater self-esteem, fewer instances of substance abuse and lower rates of depression in LGBTQ adolescents, the report states. Conversely, young adults who experience family rejection have higher rates of depression, substance abuse, sexually risky behaviors and suicide attempts.\nSending your child to conversion therapy is, quite obviously, neither supportive nor accepting.\n\"Now we can communicate that message with the backing of scientific literature, as well as an official government document,\" Wolff said.\nIt can be tempting, he noted, to assume conversion therapy — indeed, rejection of LGBTQ adolescents in any form — is largely fading into the distance.\nIt's not.\n\"Much of society is more tolerant and affirming,\" he said. \"But that is not true in every part of this country, and it's not true even in the more progressive parts of this country. Kids who are gender nonconforming are still targets for bullying and victimization, and their parents are often not on board with how they're expressing their gender or sexuality.\n\"That can really catch kids off guard,\" he said, \"when they expect their peers and family to be accepting and they get active rejection or bullying instead.\"\nMaybe this report will be another step away from such madness.\nhstevens@tribpub.com\nTwitter @heidistevens13\n Medical Research Mental Health Research Mental Health Family", "external_links": ["http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA15-4928/SMA15-4928.pdf", "http://time.com/3655718/leelah-alcorn-suicide-transgender-therapy/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56266a82/turbine/ct-lgbtq-conversion-report-debunks-balancing-20151020", "http://www.newsweek.com/illinois-bans-gay-conversion-therapy-lgbt-minors-364782", "http://www.adler.edu/"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:01:29.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
