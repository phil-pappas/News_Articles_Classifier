This proverb, now extinct, is perhaps related to times of slavery, forcible conscription, or forced labour, when victims were rounded up and tied, then marched out of their villages into an unknown future. Corvee, or forced labour, was abolished in Egypt in the mid nineteenth century. Slavery disappeared shortly afterwards.\nSource: Egyptian Proverbs, (Al-Ahram Center for Translation and Publishing, 1986) by Ahmed Taymour Pasha\nTranslated by: Nabil Shawkat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:23:59.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
