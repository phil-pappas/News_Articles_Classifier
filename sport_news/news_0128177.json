Suzuki pitched the eighth inning of the Miami Marlins' 7-2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, giving up a run and two hits, but hitting 87 mph on the radar gun.\nThis likely represents Suzuki's final season, as he batted .229 in 398 at-bats with the Miami Marlins. But Sunday's show ensured Suzuki did not go out as a .229 hitter. It meant he went out like he played most of his major league career - surprising and entertaining countless fans.\nGALLERY: POSITION PLAYERS PITCHING\nMop up duty: Position players pitching\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:29:30.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
