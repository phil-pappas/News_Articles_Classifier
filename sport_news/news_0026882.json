We’re waiting to see and we’re trying to secure that,” said Dunkin.\nA title eliminator between the two seems logical since the 24-year-old Juarez (17-3, 13 knockouts) is the number one-ranked challenger while Donaire (35-3, 23 KO’s) is the second-rated boxer of the WBO’s 122-lb division.\nDonaire’s December schedule in a lot of ways lessened his frustrations after his camp and representatives of Quigg supposedly came close to sealing a deal that would have made the two face each other next month in Manchester.\nQuigg’s camp however backed off from the negotiating table by claiming that a bout opposite fellow British world champion Carl Frampton is their main target.\n“Nonito was so excited and to go do it on the road and everything. But this is a great opportunity because he’ll get to fight on TruTV and he’s excited about the new network,” said Dunkin.\nDonaire’s last bout happened July of this year in Macau where he stopped Anthony Settoul of France inside two rounds.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:40:34.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
