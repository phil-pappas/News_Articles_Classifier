Remember, the conditional start players' place in your individual lineup will depend on your specific roster and league parameters. Use those rules and this guide in conjunction with our weekly sortable position rankings to build your best possible lineup. • Join this FREE money 1-week fantasy football league. Top half of teams win cash on Sunday! Sponsored by FanDuel New York Jets at Miami Dolphins\nMust start: Chris Ivory (quad), Lamar Miller (ankle), Brandon Marshall, Jarvis Landry, Jordan Cameron, Jets DST, Dolphins DST\nIvory was active last week but didn’t play a down, and the Jets' offense suffered. The fact that he was made active, however, augurs well for this week. The Jets have been a nightmare for opposing backs, but the Dolphins have to figure out a way to get the run game going. As disappointing as Lamar Miller has been this year, I believe he will ultimately be fine. He’s a strong buy-low candidate, even if he struggles against the Jets. Marshall is up to 33 targets on the season, and the Jets have thrown the ball 59% of the time. He’ll likely draw Brent Grimes on Sunday. Landry has also turned into a matchup-proof player, racking up 35 targets, including seven in the red zone, in Miami’s first three games.\nFantasy Video Fantasy football Week 4: Complete player rankings for every position by Michael Beller", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Mbeller", "http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_8361b_1143c_&affid=5767&siteid=8361&adid=1143"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:51:10.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
