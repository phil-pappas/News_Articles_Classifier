By TRAVIS JAUDON Jenkins used a variety of weapons to beat Islands 35-0 in a Region 1-AAA (B) game Friday night at Memorial Stadium.\nPlaying without injured star running back Arkeem Byrd, the Warriors had no problem using other playmakers to down the Sharks. Most notably, running backs Melvin Smalls Jr. and Ameen Stevens carried the load in Byrd’s absence.\nSmalls scored on the second play from scrimmage to put Jenkins up 7-0\n— taking an inside handoff and bouncing it to the outside before outrunning the Shark secondary 36-yards to the end zone.\nEarly in the second quarter, it was Smalls again who lifted the Warriors’ offense. The 5-foot-9 junior took the ball at the Islands’ 40-yard line and exploded up the gut all the way down to the 5 for a quick 35-yard gain.\nOne play later, Smalls rumbled up the middle for a touchdown to finish what he started. Smalls completed his night with 102 rushing yards on 10 carries.\nWhile Smalls did the majority of his damage in the first half, Stevens shouldered the bulk of the carries after intermission. Stevens racked up 98 of his 101 rushing yards after halftime while Smalls got all but two of his yards before the break. Stevens, a sophomore, logged two rushing touchdowns on his ten carries.\n“Arkeem is Arkeem,” Jenkins coach Tim Adams said after the game. “But with Smalls and Stevens, we’re blessed to have some good athletes to step in for (Byrd).”\nIt was a sloppy start for both teams as each side had two turnovers in the first quarter. Islands fumbled twice, while Jenkins fumbled on its second possession before turning the ball over on downs on its third series.\nJenkins quarterback Javonte Middleton started slowly before turning it on midway through the first half. Middleton, just a sophomore, missed on his first two attempts, of the game but then completed his next seven passes. He finished with 107 yards on 8 of 14 passing with a touchdown and an interception.\nOn the receiving end of the seventh consecutive completion was fellow sophomore Jamonte Roberts, who hauled in a 12-yard touchdown pass from Middleton with under a minute left in the second quarter after running a beautiful route to get open in the back corner of the end zone.\nRoberts, who finished with two receptions for 36 yards, was one of four receivers to catch a pass from Middleton in the game. Senior Kenneth Morman had 55 receiving yards on three catches while senior Timothy Leeks chipped in two catches for 12 yards.\n“These guys knew what was at stake,” Adams said of his team rebounding after a slow start. “Sometimes we just have to remind them a little harder than other times, but they knew it was a sub-region opponent ... They knew it was a game we had to win.”\nIslands 0 0 0 0 - 0\nJenkins 7 14 7 7 - 35\nJ-Melvin Smalls Jr. 36 run (GodGreat Setoh kick)\nJ-Smalls 5 run (Setoh kick)\nJ-Jamonte Roberts 12 pass from Javonte Middleton (Setoh kick)\nJ-Ameen Stevens 13 run (Setoh kick)\nJ-Stevens 14 run (Setoh kick)\nRecords—Jenkins 3-2, 1-0 Region 1-AAA (B); Islands 1-4, 0-2.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:03:06.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
