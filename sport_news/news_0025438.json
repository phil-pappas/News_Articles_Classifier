She has been a part of six women championship eights at the Head of the Charles Regatta. The Sacramento, Calif., native also holds five golds from world championship races. So, when it comes to navigating the winding, twisting tribulations of the three-mile Charles River course, Whipple has a font of experience on which to rely.\nAs a member of the U.S. Rowing Eight, Whipple coxed the team to Head of the Charles victories in 2001-02, 2005-07 and again in 2012. The 2007 crew raced to a course-record time of 15:26.5. Despite all her success, Whipple claims the Boston regatta tests the willpower and mental acumen of a coxswain like no other race.\n“It’s iconic. For a coxswain, it’s probably the No. 1 race in the world because you’re navigating all the turns,” said Whipple, who will coxswain the New York Athletic Club crew in the championship fours this afternoon.\n“It’s basically a time-trials race. So, decisions have to be made. Is someone not going to yield like they are supposed to? Will I get caught up in someone’s wake? The biggest decision that a coxswain has to make is to tell the team to ease off. Not a lot of coxswains are brave enough to make that call. You have to ask yourself, ‘How do I make that decision?’ But, a coxswain definitely has to be the leader in the boat.”\nCompounding those decisions is the necessity to assimilate the often difficult wind conditions along the Charles that can raise havoc with any crew, no matter how experienced and resilient.\n“The conditions can be challenging. But that’s something that you have to expect when you row in these ‘head’ type races. It does change. But at the end of the day, you’re going to go as fast as you can within the conditions,” she said. “But it’s a fun experience. Everyone wants to race here in the fall. It’s the last chance to race before the winter. Everyone has something to prove.’’\nIn the boat today with Whipple (who’ll be using her married name of Mary Murray) will be NYAC members Lindsay Shoop, Sarah Zelenka, Sara Hendershot and Esther Lofgren.\nAlthough Whipple is retiring from competitive Olympic rowing, she will continue to row in future regatta events. Whipple also has a new endeavor called, “The Ninth Seat” (so-named because the coxswain is the ninth person in a boat) and plans to provide clinics for young rowers.\n“It’s my way of giving back to the rowing community,” Whipple said. “It’s a leadership role. It gives me a chance to help the next generation of rowers.”\nAnd, if she ever needs a doubles partner for subsequent Head of the Charles events, she can always call twin sister, Sarah, an assistant coach for women’s crew at the University of California-Berkeley.\nWhipple, who will perform analyst duties at rowing events for NBC, was also promoting the USOC’s ‘Road to Rio Tour’ as American athletes gear up for the next Olympic Games in Brazil in 2016. Sponsored by Liberty Mutual Insurance, the company has also insured medals previously won by Olympic athletes like Whipple.\n“They did it for Sochi, too,” she said. “It’s great because once you lose it, they (International Olympic Committee) don’t replace them.’’\nWhipple would just have go out and win more gold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:25:49.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
