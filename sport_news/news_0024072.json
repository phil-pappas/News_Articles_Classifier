Even though MacPhail was front and center at a September press conference announcing former general manager Ruben Amaro Jr.’s dismissal , and the fact that he has been searching and conducting interviews for the new general manager, Pat Gillick still had the title of president.\nThat’s no longer the case.\nThe Phillies made it official, effective Wednesday, that MacPhail is assuming the role of president.\n“As the Phillies begin this new chapter in the club’s history, we are confident that Andy is the right person to lead the organization,” ownership partner John Middleton said in a press release from the team. “Speaking on behalf of the ownership group, we are pleased with the input that Andy has provided over the past few months. His years of baseball knowledge, combined with his passion for the game, are important as he moves forward with his primary objective of developing a championship-caliber team.”\nGillick, who became interim president of the Phillies in August 2014 while David Montgomery was on medical leave, had the interim label removed in January when Montgomery returned as the club’s chairman.\nMiddleton thanked Gillick for his “invaluable leadership to the Phillies for the past 14 months,” in the release and said the former president will assume an advisory role assisting the front office.\nsmgross@mcall.com\nTwitter @SteveGrossMCall", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SteveGrossMCall"], "published": "2015-10-14T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:37:10.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
