Despite being the underdogs, the Falcons were never out of striking distance against the Cougars (6-2, 4-1 3 ) who secured a playoff spot with the win.“We’re getting where we want to be,” Falcons coach Kevin Saunders said. “I saw it this week in practice a light switch went on, our offensive line came together and physically, and I think we outplayed them tonight.” Pebblebrook started strong as Tre Wright broke a 55-yard run on the third play of the game to give the Falcons first-and-goal at the 8-yard line. Pebblebrook couldn’t take advantage though as quarterback Jacobe Burke was blitzed and fumbled on third down to negate the early opportunity.Marquis Hill’s 40-yard touchdown run put Newnan ahead two possessions later. A short punt on Pebblebrook’s next possession gave the Cougars great field position at the 36 and they would score six plays later when Darryel Hines bulldozed his way for a 5-yard touchdown. Newnan had a chance to add more points in the second quarter, but a defensive stand forced Newnan into a 41-yard field goal attempt that was short and preserved the two score difference at half.“That was a huge stop — that gave us some momentum, then we messed up the kickoff.” Saunders said.Newnan silenced the home crowd at the start the third quarter when Kadarius Satterwhite returned the kickoff 76 yards to give Newnan the 20-0 lead. Pebblebrook’s offense came to life in the second half, scoring twice while gaining 154 yards. The Falcons had a chance to get on the board early in the third quarter with a first-and-goal at the 4. But they were stopped twice from the 1 yard line to end what had been a 12-play, 42-yard drive.“We fought tooth-and-nail and played hard,” Saunders said. “This was the best we played all season.” Pebblebrook would finally get on the board when Gianni Montgomery ran 13 yards for a touchdown 6 minutes into the third quarter.The Falcons would score again when Burke found Montgomery again for a 22-yard touchdown with just over 3 minutes remaining in the game.Tre Wright finished the game with 16 carries for 112 yards for the Falcons, while Gianni Montgomery accounted for 87 total yards and two touchdowns.
