The agreement with ICC, which runs through 2023, confirms Nissan as a global sponsor of cricket's international tournaments, including the ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy and ICC World Twenty20, as well as under-19 and women's cricket and qualifying events. Although officials were tightlipped about the size of the deal, they said it's \"a double digit figure in millions of dollars and a big part of our marketing focus\".\nSaid Roel de Vries, corporate vice-president and global head of marketing and brand strategy for Nissan: \"We are targeting 5% market share in India by 2020. We believe India is a strategic part of the automotive future and our future. This investment in cricket is big and a majority of the impact will be felt in India which shows our focus on India.\" Nissan has not had a great run in India in recent months with a 58% drop in sales in September alone.\nAs a global partner, Nissan will have extensive in-venue activation, broadcast and digital rights at all ICC events. Nissan is already associated with a number of sporting events which includes the Champions League, the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Olympic teams of Great Britain, Mexico and Brazil among others.\nAlthough the partnership is with the Nissan brand, the auto major can and will use its sister brands too as part of its promotional efforts.\nMore money for best Test team\nThe ICC board has decided to double the prize money of the top-ranked Test team to $1 million from its existing $500,000 from April 1 next year and also increase investment in women's crick et five-fold. A media release said, \"The board approved an increased alloca tion of $65 million as the prize money for the top-ranked Test sides and for men's and women's ICC events during the period 2016-2023. This represents a 41% in the total prize money paid to players compared to the previous eightyear cycle. In a decision to better re ward the best performing Test teams, the board has doubled the prize money for sides that top the ICC Test championship table each year at the 1 April cutoff date.\nBCCI-ICC relationship won't be affected, says Richardson\nMumbai: ICC CEO David Richardson has said N Srinivasan being ICC chairman and Shashank Manohar being BCCI president will not affect relationships between the BCCI and the world governing body . \"At the moment Mr Srinivasan is the BCCI representative to the ICC and we have no issues with that,\" Richardson said.
