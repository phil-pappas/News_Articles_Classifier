(AP) â€” A woman arrested on a DUI charge crashed into a crowd of spectators Saturday during the Oklahoma State University homecoming parade, killing three people and injuring nearly two dozen others, police said.\nStillwater police Capt. Kyle Gibbs said the woman's sedan plowed into an unoccupied motorcycle of an officer who was working security at the parade, then into the crowd. The driver of the sedan was taken into custody on a driving under the influence charge, Gibbs said.\nGibbs said three people were killed and 22 were injured in the crash Saturday morning, including eight who were airlifted to hospitals with critical injuries.\nPolice said Adacia Chambers, 25, was taken into custody on the DUI charge. Her hometown was not released.\n\"We treat these like we would any homicide investigation,\" Gibbs said. \"It'll probably take several days to get additional information as to the cause of the accident\"\nOklahoma State University President Burns Hargis said there had been discussion about canceling the homecoming game Saturday afternoon against Kansas but that it would be played. The victims were expected to be remembered with a moment of silence.\nDave Kapple of Houston told the Stillwater News Press that he and his son were about 10 feet away when they saw the vehicle barreling into the crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:05:41.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
