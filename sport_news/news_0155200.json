(Photo: Jose Juarez / Special to Detroit News) \nBeverly Hills — Detroit Country Day shut down Omar Salih and Detroit Cesar Chavez’s high-scoring offense, 70-6, on Thursday night to kick off Week 6 of the high school football season.\nCountry Day, ranked No. 1 in Division 4 by the Associated Press, would have nothing of Salih having a huge night.\nCountry Day (5-1) turned one of Salih’s passes into a 30-yard interception return for a touchdown by Kone Bowman less than a minute into the game.\nIt led 22-0 3 minutes, 35 seconds into the game, forcing Salih to misfire on his first 10 attempts. Country Day’s defense put tremendous pressure on Salih, and when he did throw on target, his receivers dropped the ball.\nSalih’s lone bright spot in the first half was a 64-yard touchdown pass to Chris Goodley with 10:05 left in the half to pull Cesar Chavez (4-2) to within 29-6. He was 9-for-35 for 115 yards in the first half, but had two of his passes intercepted.\n“I played in between the slot and receiver to bait the quarterback and once he let the ball go I jumped the route and brought it back,” Bowman said of his touchdown. “Our scout offensive gave us a great look all week and they just threw the ball all week against us. I enjoyed playing them tonight.”\nCountry Day led 50-6 at halftime and put the running clock into play with Larry Penson’s 75-yard kickoff return for a score to start the second half. Country Day intercepted Salih five times.\nSalih, a 6-foot, 170-pound senior, entered the night on pace for a 4,000-yard passing regular-season, throwing for 2,344 yards and 26 touchdowns.\nHe had consecutive games totaling 543 yards and seven touchdown passes, and 615 yards and eight touchdowns this season.\nSalih, however, had yet to face the type of defense Country Day showcased.\nSoccer \nBirmingham Roeper 2, Oakland Christian 2 : Andy Reed for Roeper.\nOther soccer scores \nAllen Park Cabrini 3, West Bloomfield Frankel Jewish Academy 0\nLutheran Westland 3, Newport Lutheran South 0\ndavid.goricki@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/DavidGoricki \nDetroit News staff contributed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:52:07.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
