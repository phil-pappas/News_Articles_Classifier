(Jim Middlekauff | lehighvalleylive contributor) \nSalisbury’s 39-29 defeat of Northern Lehigh Friday night felt like a playoff football game. \nThe calendar read mid-October, not mid-November, so it could not have been a playoff game, officially. It was just a Colonial League game. \nBut it sure seemed like a playoff – and to the Falcons, it was. \n“That was what we said,” said Salisbury (4-3) senior Devin Irwin , who scored three touchdowns in the win. “This is a playoff game.” \nSalisbury, football, and playoffs have not been often used in the same sentence lately; the Falcons have not been to the District 11 postseason since 2009. Salisbury went 4-6 last season. \nBut these are not the same old Falcons. \n“We knew we were a good team all along,” said Salisbury senior quarterback Tevon Weber (11-for-17 passing, 97 yards, 2 TDs; 44 yards rushing). “We know people think it’s Salisbury, we’re not that good and that’s why we don’t pay attention to the press much. If the reporters want to think we’re not a good team, they can, but we’re going to change that.” \nThe Falcons may already have done so. \n“This is a huge win for us,” said senior captain tight end/defensive end Kyle Hartzell , who caught one of Weber’s TD passes on a hitch pattern from 6 yards out. “We’ve had had some hard times at Salisbury, and we wanted to show we could beat a team like Northern Lehigh. We want to show what we can do against some pretty good kids.” \nConsider that done. \nSalisbury was hardly perfect against the Bulldogs (4-3), who led at three different points in the game. But, as Weber noted, desire won out. \n“After we lost to Northwestern last week (30-22), we knew we had to win this game if we wanted to go the playoffs,” he said. “We know how good we could be if we put it all together. And tonight we had too many turnovers (three) and we still got the win.” \nThere were on-field reasons why that was so, but the off-field reasons might have been bigger. \nFirst, as Irwin noted, the Falcons had fallen behind 14-0 to Pen Argyl two weeks and rallied for a 35-14 win, and learned from that game to be confident playing from behind. \nSecond, Salisbury never once seemed even remotely bothered Friday even when plays went against them. No finger-pointing or shouting or helmet-slamming followed Bulldog successes. Just calmness and determination filled the air. \n“It’s all about the team,” Weber said. “We’ve been in tough situations, and now we’ve finally won one of these games.” \nThird, Salisbury’s team is unusually close even in a sport that can engender really tight bonds, \n“We’ve known each other for so long, I think we’re more than a family, whatever that would be,” Hartzell said. “We have an amazing bunch of kids.” \nThat’s all music to head coach Andy Cerco’s ears. \n“Our theme this year is ‘Together’,” he said. “We know there’s going to be ebbs and flows in games and we have to face them together.” \nAnd maybe get ready for a playoff run together as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:56:09.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
