Well, he said the same for losing too. But our man here, seems to have heard one side of the story, and you bet he has heard it pretty well. Jagmeet Gill doesn’t make his words rush, to match up the time, speed, distance parameters. There are no sudden hair pin turns in his conversation; in fact each word glides smoothly on the tarmac. Hear this articulate and soft spoken man talk and you would definitely want to look at the real medals that he has won in car rallying. This time it is a hat-trick! Jagmeet is yet again the overall winner in the adventure category of Maruti Suzuki Raid De Himalaya 2015, being the proud driver to be declared the winner in overall six categories of adventure. Winning definitely seems to be a habit with this one, and there are no ‘almosts’ in his road book. And, I did it again I started rallying almost seven years back, and after this hat-trick, I definitely feel each and every moment, every risk was worth it. So, you want to be like me Being a good rallyist doesn’t mean driving full throttle, to be one you actually have to work hard. Personal fitness plays an important role here. I play squash at least five times a week; I take healthy food, and keep my mind active. Apart from this, one has to maintain consistency in rallying which comes through focus. Also, a driver, like me should know the navigation part as well. If I know navigation, I can be a good 30 per cent help to my navigator. My car & I\nUndoubtedly, rapport with my machine is the most important thing in the rally. This means, I need to know my machine in and out since I have to make it run for six days without service. I can’t just fasten the safety belt and say I am ready to rally. I have to be there when it is being modified for the rally. And lastly, I have really trust the vehicle, and trust me it doesn’t betray. Well, mostly… Hurdles…I must cross\nOne, rallying whether it is Raid De Himalaya or Mughal or Desert Storm happens in extreme weather conditions. In Raid De Himalaya, we have to drive through in zero degree temperature, a condition where only 6-7 per cent of the active brain functions. To stay focused in this condition is the biggest challenge. Facing fear\nOh yes, we all face fear, and it is the fear of the machine breaking down. But then a good rallyist is always prepared for it. Mind games\nIt is but natural for my mind to wander especially on stretches where there is no ‘time control’ put. I really don’t know what I think about at that time, however, I do know that I successfully manage to bring it under control. The man I look up to Vijay Parmar, I have always looked up to him for any kind doubts, and he is a damn good motivator. Make & break moments\nThis year’s Raid, day three is what I would zero in on my make and break moment. On this day, I was supposed to go from Dalhousie to Srinagar wherein I had to cross the Saach Pass. This is the same route I took in 2011. Unlike, that year this time I managed to get an edge over the other rallyist in my segment. Next is what\nI am not opening any rally driving school, I am though willing to teach anyone who has the passion and the will to learn. At the same time, I might try extreme rally driving in SJOBA and also do some international rallying events. jasmine@tribunemail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:13:13.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
