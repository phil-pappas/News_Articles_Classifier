(Photo by Greg Macafee) Greg MacAfee Reporter CAMP VERDE- Last week at Camp Verde both the girls and boys soccer teams took on the Chino Valley Cougars on Thursday in a double header and turned around to take on the Grand Canyon Phantoms on Saturday. It seemed as though both teams mirrored one another in the results against both opponents. On Thursday, the girls lost a stunner to the Cougars losing by one goal with a 3-2 final. In the boys game, it seemed as though the Cowboys had found a way to keep the #1 ranked team at bay. Nathan Schultz netted a goal within the first two minutes of the game, and the Cowboys stayed on top for most of the first half. In the second half it seemed as though a sleeping giant had awoken in the form of Chino Valley's striker Arturo Gomez as he did not stay quiet for much of the second half netting one goal towards the end of the first half and added four more after the break. With the final score 6-1, Chino Valley sophomore Elijah Desmond netted the final goal for the Cougars as they remain on top of the Division V rankings, sporting a 9-1 record.Both Camp Verde teams were able to get the sour taste of loss out of their mouth on Saturday though as the Grand Canyon Phantoms came to town. With the girls playing first they were able to set the tone for a strong showing from both Camp Verde teams. The girls came out strong and went on to win 7-0. The boys were next to play, and though they weren't able to replicate the shutout that the girls were able to pitch they went onto victory with a final score of 8-1. The next matchup for the boys is against Arizona Charter on Saturday at 2 p.m. The girls will take the field right after and face off with Northland Prep at 4 p.m. -- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:51:08.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
