The Pirates set up next week’s home showdown with Jacksonville by taking care of business against the Wildcats, defeating Richlands 55-13 in a Coastal 3-A Conference game. “Our offense clicked all week,” Swansboro coach Tim Laspada said. “We had a good mix.” The Pirates, who surpassed last year’s win total, are now 5-3 overall and 2-1 in the conference. They play host to Jacksonville (5-2, 3-0) next week in a game that could play a big part in conference seeding. Meanwhile, Richlands fell to 1-7, 0-3 and will visit state power Havelock (8-0, 3-0) next week. After the game against Swansboro, Richlands coach Justin Snider had to take a seat . Surrounded by confetti thrown by students during the game and the homecoming festivities at halftime, Snider had little to say after his team dropped its fourth consecutive game. “It started on the first play from scrimmage,” Snider said, referring to a screen pass from Swansboro senior quarterback Eli Frantz to junior Isaiah Bailey. That play saw Bailey catch the pass and sprint up the sideline , going 74 yards for the game’s first touchdown that gave the Pirates a 7-0 lead just 19 seconds left into the game. “It was a deflator,” Snider added. Swansboro scored the first 34 points in the first half, mixing it up with three touchdown passes and two runs. Bailey added an 11-yard touchdown run to make it 14-0. Frantz would throw three more touchdowns passes to go along with 343 yards while Khalil Stewart had two touchdown runs for the Pirates. Frantz entered with an area-best 1,047 yards and 12 touchdown passes. Markuise Hemby, Marquis Hodges and Taylor Signorelli all had touchdown catches for Swansboro. Hemby entered as the area’s top receiver with 31 catches for 526 yards and six scores. Hemby added six receptions for 174 yards. The Wildcats prevented the Pirates from registering their second shutout of the season with 2:52 left in the first half as quarterback Ben Jackson hit Shayvon Kornegay on a slant for a 90 - yard touchdown pass. It cut Swansboro’ s lead to 34-7. It was one of the few bright spots for Richlands. Jackson finished with two touchdown passes and 125 yards .
