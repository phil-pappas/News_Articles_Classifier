Dipoto was hired by the Mariners in late September after stepping down as Angels general manager earlier this year. \nServais, 48, and Dipoto shared a working relationship in Los Angeles, where Servais oversaw scouting and player development. \nServais doesn't have any experience as a manager, but he recently interviewed for the vacant San Diego Padres managerial position. He was a catcher in the majors from 1991-2001. \nThe Mariners also interviewed Tampa Bay Rays third base coach Charlie Montoyo, Red Sox special assistant Jason Varitek and minor league manager Phil Nevin.
