The similarities of views were exchanged during talks between President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour on the second day of his visit on the first-leg of his three-nation tour of West Asia. The five broad areas both sides touched upon were counter-terrorism, Syria, Palestine, UN reforms and way forward and steps to increase economic engagement between India and Jordan. With problems in Syria within, on one hand, and its battle with Islamic State on the other, India emphasised the need to find a political solution asserting that it cannot be solved through military means. However, it sought to draw a distinction over the Russian air strikes to check advancement of IS in the area as against the crackdown by the current Bashar al-Assad regime. “There was a meeting of minds on a long term solution based on Geneva-1 accord and inclusivity in transition to new phase with parties in current government and those outside sit down to negotiate and come to an agreement…and fresh elections,” Secretary (East) Anil Wadhwa said briefing the media after the talks. On Palestine, the President said India’s traditional support to the Palestine cause remains steadfast and unwavering. New Delhi supports a negotiated solution resulting in a sovereign, independent, viable and united state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognised borders. Jordan shares a similar vision. On terrorism, both sides favoured a comprehensive solution to the problem and not a piecemeal approach with India advocating the early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:10:25.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
