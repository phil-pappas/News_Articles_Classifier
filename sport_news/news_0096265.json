They were unsure what happened other than seeing Greg Olsen standing in the end zone celebrating a winning touchdown. \nAfter a week of vowing the fourth-quarter collapses were over, the Seattle Seahawks crumpled once again. \n\"It's very frustrating, especially when you know we had them,\" Thomas said. \"We don't (stink). We know who we are. We're not finishing. We know we're going to be in those pressure situations every game.\" \nCam Newton was the culprit this time, leading a pair of long fourth-quarter touchdown drives and capping Carolina's rally with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Olsen with 32 seconds left in the Panthers' 27-23 win over Seattle on Sunday. \nIt was the second straight loss for the Seahawks (2-4), who, heading into Thursday's road game against the improving 49ers, are facing a climb beyond just correcting their continued problems in closing out games. \nAccording to STATS, since 1990 only 14 of 168 teams to start the season 2-4 have reached the playoffs and none have ever reached the Super Bowl. That was the expectation for Seattle before the season. And now, it's just getting the problems fixed. \n\"To be where we are right now, it puts us in a position of tremendous adversity for a team,\" Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. \"It calls on you a lot of stuff, but it calls on us to believe in the guys in the locker room and believe in what we're doing and hang together until we get things right.\" Advertisement \nCarroll noted that Seattle believes it should be 6-0 considering in all six games the Seahawks have held a lead in the fourth quarter. But the claim stands hollow when the results don't match the statement and the track record continues to be mostly failure. Seattle held fourth-quarter leads of at least seven points against St. Louis, Cincinnati and Carolina and lost all three. \nThis time, Seattle led 23-14 with 11:46 left after Steven Hauschka's third field goal. The lead was still nine when Carolina took possession at its own 20 with 8:08 remaining. Over their final two drives, the Panthers ran 17 plays, rolled up 160 total yards and scored 14 points. \n\"It's frustrating only because I know we're not playing up to our potential,\" offensive tackle Russell Okung said. \"We're going to make our mistakes, but the best thing we've done in the past is overcome them. We haven't done that yet, but we will.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:32:17.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
