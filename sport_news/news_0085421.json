But the Redskins have so many injuries, that they had no choice but to make RG3 active against the New York Jets . Among Washington's inactives: left tackle Trent Williams, wideout DeSean Jackson, cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver, and tight end Jordan Reed — all starters. \nIn other quarterback news: Buffalo's EJ Manuel starts in place of the inactive Tyrod Taylor (sprained left knee) against Cincinnati, while Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger (sprained left knee) sits against Arizona, his third game in a row on the sideline. \nBoth the Browns and Broncos were missing key defenders: Denver's pass rusher DeMarcus Ware (back), and Cleveland's cornerback Joe Haden (concussion) and safety Tashaun Gipson (ankle). \nHouston star J.J. Watt was active despite an illness and expected to start at Jacksonville, which was without running back T.J. Yeldon (groin). Toby Gerhart was going to start in Yeldon's place. \nFor the Bears, the good news was that wide receivers Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) and Eddie Royal (ankle) and tight end Martellus Bennett (quadriceps) were back from injuries and active after all three were listed as questionable. \nThe Vikings had a surprise inactive in defensive end Everson Griffen, the team's leader with three sacks, who was out with an illness. Rookie Danielle Hunter filling in with his first career start. Another key defensive player out Sunday was Titans linebacker Avery Williamson (hamstring), who normally wears the coach/player communication device calling out plays. \nAll of the inactives: \nCHICAGO AT DETROIT \nBears: CB Terrance Mitchell, S Antrel Rolle, RB Antone Smith, LB Shea McClellin, OG Nick Becton, OT Jermon Bushrod, DT Bruce Gaston. \nLions: S James Ihedigbo, RB Joique Bell, LB DeAndre Levy, OT Corey Robinson, TE Eric Ebron, TE Brandon Pettigrew, DT Haloti Ngata. \nKANSAS CITY AT MINNESOTA \nChiefs: QB Aaron Murray, CB Marcus Cooper, OT Jah Reid, WR Frankie Hammond Jr., TE Brian Parker, LB Josh Mauga, NT Dontari Poe. \nVikings: QB Taylor Heinicke, WR Charles Johnson, CB Jabari Price, C Nick Easton, TE Chase Ford, DE Justin Trattou, DE Everson Griffen, \nMIAMI AT TENNESSEE \nDolphins: CB Tony Lippett, LB Chris McCain, C Sam Brenner, OL Jeff Linkenbach, WR Matt Hazel, DT A.J.
