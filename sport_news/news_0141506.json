For Marlborough and Valley Tech it came in the first week of the season. For Uxbridge, a week later. But they were received by all. And for these three teams, it appears early losses are paying major dividends as we head toward the midway point of the high school football season. Each team appears to be rounding into form, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Case in point, each won by shutout this weekend, the three squads combining for a 110-0 point differential. And, at 3-1, each is charting a remarkably similar path. Kicked up It was a field goal off the foot of Milford kicker Sean Lehane as the clock ticked down that dealt Marlborough its only loss of the season, a heartbreaking 22-21 defeat on opening night. It wasn’t an ideal start to the season for the Panthers. Surely, their goal was to start the year with a victory, using that momentum to propel themselves into a critical Week 2 matchup with Midland B rival Algonquin. The loss, however, might have served a similar purpose, albeit by a different route. “We just knew we needed to improve,” said Marlborough coach Sean Mahoney. “I think we didn’t panic, we just realized we needed to get better. “Algonquin is a talented team so I think Week One emphasized that we need to reduce mistakes and tackle better and be more physical. The kids understood that and each week we’ve gotten better in those areas.” Marlborough responded with a 28-14 victory over the Tomahawks. The Panthers have been even better the past two weeks, beating Groton-Dunstable 35-7 before shutting out Westborough 41-0 on Saturday. And this was the team Mahoney imagined when the Panthers returned to the field earlier this summer. “We have high expectations,” said Mahoney. “We want to win the league, make the playoffs, beat Hudson. The loss to Milford didn’t interfere with any of those goals. We’d like to be 4-0 but we feel good about our potential.” Reality check There was significant turnover for Valley Tech this season. The Beavers brought back just four returning starters from last year’s 10-1 team. That did little to diminish their confidence, though, which may have been this problem. “A lot of these kids hadn’t played varsity football before and thought that just because we’ve had success the last couple years that we would go out and win,” said Valley Tech coach Jim Archibald. “And for us as a program, we realized that wasn’t the case.” Page 2 of 3 - That became abundantly clear after the Beavers were smacked by Maynard in their season-opener. Valley Tech was clearly overmatched, turning the ball over seven times in a 46-20 loss. “They came out right away and took it to us a little bit,” said Archibald. “They beat us up up front, and every time we tried to get back into the game with a long run we seemed to fumble it away. They outplayed us and out-physicaled us.” According to its coach, it was a lesson Valley Tech needed to learn. “I think anytime you lose by 25 it causes you to take a step back and reevaluate things,” said Archibald. “We were at a point with our senior class, we said either you guys are going to fix it or we're going with the younger guys. They came back and worked hard. So far they’ve been executing very well. “We challenged them, and credit to them they kept fighting and we're very proud of the way they’ve led us the last few weeks.” The Beavers responded with a 35-12 victory at Monty Tech and have posted two straight shutouts, a 47-0 victory over Assabet and a 28-0 win over Worcester Tech on Saturday. “We’ve been creating turnovers on defense,” said Archibald. “We’ve been getting good field position and we’re very happy with progress the defense has made since Week One. They’re playing as a whole unit whereas in week one everyone was running around trying to do everything on their own.” Getting personal The Uxbridge defense takes pride in what it does. “They take it as a challenge amongst themselves as a group,” said Uxbridge coach Bob Martellio. “They want to be as stingy as possible.” So Martellio knew, after losing to Grafton 21-13 in the second game of the season, that the unit was going to take it personally. \"The next day at practice the kids said, ‘This isn’t going to happen again,’” said Martellio. “And they’ve stepped up. They’re making sure whatever they can do to make sure we win, that’s what we’re doing.” The loss dropped the Spartans’ record to 1-1 after a win over Worcester North in the season-opener. Since then, Uxbridge has refocused on putting points at a premium for opposing offenses. The Spartans responded with a 49-6 thrashing of David Prouty, and this past weekend dominated Bartlett 41-0 in an important SWCL matchup. “The kids understand that when opportunities are presented to you, you have to go out and execute,” said Martellio. “Defensively, we’ve done that the last two weeks. We’ve had players step up.” Page 3 of 3 - That includes middle linebackers Brent Whitlock and Kyle Suchanek, defensive tackle Dan Petrillo, safety Cam Stewart, and cornerback Oliver Sawyer. And that unit will be challenged again this week when Uxbridge hosts Southbridge on Saturday (2:30 p.m.), a matchup Martellio counts among the most challenging this season. “They’re going to come out and go right at you,” said Martellio. “It’s the most important game of the year so far. The kids have to be ready. They’re going to come out and they’re going to want to play smash-mouth football. That’s how Southrbidge always is and we don’t expect anything else.” Craig Gilvarg can be reached at 508-626-4405 or cgilvarg@wickedlocal.com . Follow him on Twitter @CraigGilvarg.
