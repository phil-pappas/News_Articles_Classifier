I'm pumped to see everybody fight,\" he said. \"It's an honor to be out here to do an open workout with everybody. I'm very thankful for this. I've trained my whole life and I've had the UFC as a goal of mine. I've always visualized this. I've always seen myself being able to fight in the UFC. And here it is. I'm excited.\"\nThe wide-eyed teenager will fight in his hometown against Francisco Trevino, who has a 12-1 professional record and is 1-1 in the UFC.\nParticipating in UFC Open Workout\nA photo posted by Sage Northcutt (@supersagenorthcutt) on Sep 30, 2015 at 12:43pm PDT\nNorthcutt acknowledges that his career is moving at an extremely quick pace, but he says he can adjust since he's been fighting since he was six or seven years old in countries like Russia, Croatia and Ireland.\n\"I've been in front of large crowds when I was little. I guess that's part of it. I guess the bigger the crowd is, the more I feel comfortable.\"\nThe Aggie also says he'll be able to balance his excitement about his UFC debut while knowing he has to take care of business.\n\"I never underestimate anybody,\" he said. \"Everybody who fights in the UFC is in the UFC for a reason. They're all good. I'm looking forward to the fight. I can't wait for the fight. I know that I've trained my hardest. It's going to be an awesome fight.\"\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://instagram.com/p/8RFLniKGl9/", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-02T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:58:04.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
