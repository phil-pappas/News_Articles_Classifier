This study assesses the ability of cardiac MRI (CMR) to distinguish between physiological LVH (so-called athlete's heart) and HCM. Methods 45 patients with HCM (71% men and 20% athletic) and 734 healthy control participants (60% men and 75% athletic) underwent CMR. Quantitative ventricular parameters were used for multivariate logistic regression with age, gender, sport status and left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV) to ED ventricular wall mass (EDM) ratio as covariates. A second model added the LV EDV : right ventricular (RV) EDV ratio. The performance of the model was subsequently tested. Results LV EDM was greater in patients with HCM (74 g/m 2 ) compared with healthy athletes/non-athletes (53/41 g/m 2 ), while LV EDV was largest in athletes (114 ml/m 2 ) as compared with non-athletes (94 ml/m 2 ) and patients with HCM (88 ml/m 2 ). The LV EDV : EDM ratio was significantly lower in patients with HCM compared with healthy controls and athletes (1.30/2.39/2.25, p<0.05). The LV EDV : RV EDV ratio was significantly greater in patients with HCM (1.10) than in healthy participants (non-athletes/athletes 0.94/0.93). The regression model resulted in high sensitivity and specificity levels in all and borderline-LVH participants (as defined by septal wall thickness). Corresponding areas under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.995 (all participants) and 0.992 (borderline-LVH participants only). Adding the LV EDV : RV EDV ratio yielded no additional improvement. Conclusions A model incorporating the LV EDV : EDM ratio can help distinguish HCM from physiological hypertrophy in athletes. This also applies to cases with borderline LVH, which present the greatest diagnostic challenge in clinical practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:01:42.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
