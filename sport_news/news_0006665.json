The Buffaloes hadn't won a Pac-12 game in almost two years, were beat up at linebacker and missing deep-threat receiver Shay Fields.\nEven when healthy, the Buffaloes have been the Pac-12's tackling dummies since joining the conference in 2011.\nNow, the baton has been passed. OSU is 2-5, 0-4. This is shaping up as the Beavers' worst season since Jerry Pettibone's last team went 2-9 in 1996.\nUtah is waiting next weekend, followed by UCLA and then California. All three have winning records and will factor into the postseason.\n\"It's going to get a whole lot tougher now,\" OSU coach Gary Andersen said. \"That team we're playing next week, we all know how good of a football team that is. The next week, we all know how good of a football team that is. And the next week.\"\nSo the Beavers' downward spiral goes.\nIt's not as if there weren't glimmers of hope.\nThe Beavers played well enough defensively to win on Saturday, holding Colorado to 328 yards total offense and mounting a pass rush effective enough to harry CU quarterback Sefo Liufau.\nOSU held the Buffaloes to three successive three-and-out possessions in the fourth quarter with the game hanging in the balance.\nBut the offense sputtered into ineffectiveness despite a gritty night by Ryan Nall .\nThe 255-pound redshirt freshman from Portland's Central Catholic High School hit between the tackles like a battering ram, finishing with 122 yards rushing.\nAside from him, though, the Beavers seemed to be operating without a road map.\nThey yo-yoed quarterbacks Nick Mitchell and Seth Collins on and off the field, a tactic Andersen said to expect for the rest of the season.\n\"We will play two quarterbacks, and will consistently roll those two kids through the game,\" Andersen said. \"We'll get them in a position to help the offense move forward. Especially with the injuries we have right now and where we're going, we're going to need both of those kids to help us.\"\nIt's one way of saying neither is the complete product.\nCollins is a dazzling runner. Mitchell throws a better ball.\nIn the fourth quarter against Colorado, Mitchell was the guy operating the offense and trying to bring the Beavers from behind.\nMitchell is a redshirt freshman who hadn't played a down of college football before Saturday's game.\nPutting the game on his shoulders is either a sign of the OSU coaches' confidence or their desperation.\nAnd, if Andersen and offensive coordinator Dave Baldwin have that much confidence in Mitchell, where has he been through the first half of the season?\nMitchell shows a world of potential, but played like a guy getting his first taste of the college level.\nHe completed 9 of 24 passes for 122 yards, albeit with a couple of unfortunate drops that would have made those numbers look a lot better.\nThe final five games of the season apparently will be like that. A sort of a shakedown cruise for 2016, to figure who has a place in the new program and where they fit.\nIn the future, Andersen promised, \"it's going to be a lot of fun. Right now it's not. It's tough. It is what it is.\n\"But we'll remember these days. We'll look back one day with a big smile on our face when we're winning games and taking care of business. We'll remember when.\"\nIt's hard to know how far away that is. The Pac-12 is a tough place for on-the-job training. Colorado has been on the bottom of the pile since 2011.\nBut no longer.\nOn Saturday night the Buffaloes wriggled free, leaving the bottom to Oregon State.\n– Ken Goe\nkgoe@oregonian.com\n503-221-8040 | @KenGoe", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KenGoe"], "published": "2015-10-25T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:15:56.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
