He’s thinks an adjustment is in order. \n“I personally feel we need to stuff the box,” DeRamos said. \nAn extra defender or two near the line of scrimmage to help stop the run would have been helpful in the team’s first two meetings this season. Both times out, the Cowboys essentially stuffed the ball down Ka’u’s throat. \n“There is always room for improvement,” DeRamos said. \nThe Trojans better hope so if they want to have chance at holding on to their title. \nWhile 11-man teams are just gearing up for the postseason in Week 7, unbeaten Kohala can wrap up the BIIF eight-man title when it welcomes the Trojans at 2 p.m. Saturday in Kapaau. \nIn their second year of eight-man, the Cowboys (3-0) have been the class of the three-team league, outscoring the Trojans (2-2) and Pahoa by a combined 99-28. \nAfter acclimating itself to the wide-open aspects of the eight-man game in 2014, the Cowboys have favored a physical approach this season. In a 30-8 victory at Pahala on Sept. 19, Kohala ran for 245 yards. In a 42-14 win at Pahoa a week later, the Cowboys ran for 155 yards. \nThe Trojans hoped they turned the corner defensively last week in slowing down the Daggers’ passing attack in 42-22 victory. \nWith Evan Manoha wracking up his second 200-yard plus game on the season on the ground, the effort was more what coach DuWayne Ke expected to see at the start of the season before inclement weather interrupted the practice schedule. \n“It’s always hard when we miss practice,” DeRamos said. “We need practice.” \nEspecially when preparing for Kohala’s rushing attack. \nKeaau (0-6 Division I, 0-7) at Hilo (4-2 Division I, 4-4), 7:15 p.m. Thursday \nNeither matchup in Division I carries any playoff significance. \nAhead of its semifinal next weekend against Waiakea, the Vikings could be ripe for a letdown coming off an overtime loss to Kealakehe – or they could be out to prove a point, \nHilo has been susceptible to giving up big gains this season, but the Cougars haven’t generated many big plays since falling behind against Kamehameha in Week 4. \nHonokaa (2-4 Division II, 2-6) at Konawaena (5-1, 7-1), 7:15 p.m. Friday \nUnless Honokaa pulls off the upset – and Hawaii Prep beats Kamehameha – the Dragons and Wildcats will match up again next weekend in the BIIF semifinals. \nSophomore quarterback Austin Ewing’s return (270 yards and two passing scores) spurred Konawaena to a 41-6 win against Hawaii Prep last weekend as the Wildcats performed like one would expect a good team would coming off a loss. \nHonokaa and quarterback Nainoa Falk have been stifled since a 2-1 start in league play, combing for just 12 points during a three-game losing streak. \nWaiakea (2-4, 2-7) at Kealakehe (5-1, 6-3), 7:15 p.m. Friday \nQuarterback Marcus DeGrate played a full game against Hilo, and the positive result was two-fold for the Waveriders. DeGrate not only showed a knack for coming up with big passes even when the Waveriders had poor field position, but Anthony Trevino’s move from QB to wide receiver gave Kealakehe another playmaker. Add in running backs Riggs Kurashige and Kobe Antolin, and the Waveriders could be on to something. \nWhile the Waveriders await a visit from Keaau in the semifinals, the Warriors expect to get back quarterback Makoa Andres. That will in turn allow Gehrig Octavio to play wide receiver, adding to the list of Waiakea’s playmakers. \nHawaii Prep (2-4 Division II, 2-5) at Kamehameha (4-2, 7-2), 7:15 p.m. Saturday \nIn a likely playoff preview, the Warriors are working on a shutout streak that extends to 10 quarters. In fact, Kamehameha has yet to give up a touchdown to a league Division II opponent. \nKa Makani has turned to Kekoa LeBlanc at quarterback in recent weeks, allowing Justin Perry to switch to wide receiver, but the passing game struggled to produce in the loss to the Wildcats.
