(Photo: Al Goldis/For the Lansing State Journal) \nHASLETT — ShonQuise Trainor’s opportunities have been limited this season with opponents focusing on him. \nDeWitt found an opportunity with the senior receiver Friday and it made a difference. \nTrainor rushed for two scores to help the Division 3 No. 4-ranked Panthers continue their dominance of rival Haslett with a 27-10 victory in a CAAC Red contest at Jamie Gent Stadium. \n“It felt great just because it’s a great rival and great game,” Trainor said. “This is all DeWitt wants right here is to win.” Box Score \nThe victory allowed DeWitt (6-0, 4-0 CAAC Red) to clinch a spot in the state playoffs for the 10th consecutive season. \nTrainor ran for scores in the first and third quarters as DeWitt posted its 14th consecutive win over the Vikings (3-3, 1-3). \n“(ShonQuise) got hurt at Waverly and hasn’t been full strength until this week,” DeWitt coach Rob Zimmerman said. “It was great to get him going again because he adds a whole different dimension. It makes us a lot harder to defend when we have ShonQuise rolling like that.” Week 6: Live prep football updates \nQuarterback Will Nagel connected with tight end Evan Conn for two scores for the Panthers, who have won 37 straight league games and 25 consecutive regular-season contests. \n“We’re trying to win football games week after week and win a conference championship — that’s our number one goal,” said Zimmerman, whose team will have an opportunity to capture a 10th straight league title when it hosts St. Johns next week. \nQuarterback Jake Tahaney had a 25-yard touchdown run and Luke Ezzo added a field goal for Haslett, which dropped its third straight and needs to win out in order to reach the playoffs. \n“It’s pretty much the start of playoffs for us,” Haslett senior lineman Blake Roe said. “We need to win these games to make the playoffs. Next week we’re, in our minds, thinking it’s Week 1 of the playoffs.” \nTahaney was having a big night on the ground before leaving the game in the fourth quarter after a hit that some on the Haslett sideline weren’t happy with. \n“It was a head-to-head collision,” Haslett junior running back Mykal Stinson said. “Everybody saw it. \n“Coach was fired up about the head-to-head collision and it should have been a flag on the play. The refs didn’t call it and we’ve just got to bounce back.” \nTahaney didn’t return and there was some frustration following the game with Haslett coach Charlie Otlewski venting his frustration toward DeWitt following the post-game handshakes. \n“He obviously was not very happy and had some things to say that probably he shouldn’t have said,” Zimmerman said. “This is all about the kids and that’s what it should be left with. The kids did a nice job and it was a great win for us. It’s a bitter rivalry and I guess you saw it right there.” \nContact Brian Calloway at bcalloway@lsj.com.
