Despite the movie’s rapidly approaching release date of 17 December in the UK and the following day in the US, Disney has not unveiled any new footage since debuting a behind-the-scenes featurette at Comic-Con in July. A new trailer is rumoured to debut this autumn.\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens has been expected to become 2015’s highest-grossing film since the first teaser trailer for the film appeared in November last year. Abrams’s film is also predicted to smash the world record for biggest global box-office opening weekend , currently held by Jurassic World after the dinosaur disaster epic’s $524.4m opening weekend in June .\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.
