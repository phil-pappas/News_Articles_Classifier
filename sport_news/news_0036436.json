Dave Reichert is expected to announce his intentions in the governor’s race on Friday, his Congressional Chief of Staff, Jeff Harvey, said.\nReichert, who is serving his sixth term in the House representing the 8th Congressional District, was elected to Congress in 2004. He has long been rumored to be a potential challenger to Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, who is seeking a second term.\nRepublican Port of Seattle Commissioner Bill Bryant announced earlier this year his entry into the race, and he was recently endorsed by two prominent Republicans, former U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton and former Gov. Dan Evans.\nBefore running for Congressional office, Reichert was King County Sheriff from 1997-2004. He started as a deputy in 1972. For a time he led the Green River Task Force that worked for years to catch Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer who confessed to 71 homicides.\nHe expressed outrage last month, when it was revealed that Ridgway was moved to a federal prison in Colorado, where he could have been held under more lenient conditions than the state prison at Walla Walla.\nAfter Reichert and the victims’ families complained, Ridgway was returned to Washington.\nInformation from The Associated Press is included in this report.\ncomment (13)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:32:45.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
