October 7th 2015 a day ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/Socceroos/ \nSOCCEROOS fans who have made the trek to Jordan for Friday morning’s World Cup qualifier are being forced to pay twenty times as much as locals for a ticket to the game. \nA ticket to the match at the 18,000 seat Amman International Stadium costs the equivalent of five Australian dollars for Jordan supporters and $100 for entry to the Australian section. \nCharging a premium for entry to “away fan” sections is permitted under FIFA regulations. \nAn Australian team official said the FFA put a “small extra charge” on away fan tickets but was shocked when informed of the massive mark-up in Amman. \nNon-Jordan fans can buy tickets to the general section but it is believed they would be ejected if they barracked against the home team. \nThe last time the Socceroos played a World Cup qualifier in Amman, in 2012, it was at the 25,000 seat King Abdullah Stadium. Australia lost 1-2 in what was described as a hostile environment.
