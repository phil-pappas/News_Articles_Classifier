The teams have a fierce rivalry, with Brandon beating Calgary in last season’s Eastern final. \nThe Brandon Wheat Kings entertain a familiar foe tonight in the Calgary Hitmen, a team they’ve met in the playoffs five times in the last decade. \nThe Wheat Kings (1-0-0-1) and Hitmen (2-0) tangled in the Eastern Conference final last spring, a hard-fought series that Brandon won in five games. \n\"Rivalries like that make it real exciting to come to the rink for those games,\" said Wheat Kings goalie Jordan Papirny, who boasts a Western Hockey League-leading 0.96 goals-against average and a .952 save percentage after two games. \nWhile Brandon won the last playoff series, Calgary has actually dominated the regular-season series in the last five years, posting a record of 12-3-0-1 against the Wheat Kings in that timespan. Last season, Brandon won three of the four meetings between the teams. \nCalgary forward Taylor Sanheim of Elkhorn said playing in Brandon is always special for the Hitmen’s Westman contingent, which includes his brother Travis and Jordy Stallard of Brandon. \n\"It’s always exciting coming home and playing in front of friends and family,\" Taylor Sanheim said. \"It’s always a good game against Brandon because they are always a good team. It will be a good game for the fans; it’s good to watch and it’s good to play in.\" \nWheat Kings head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon said the teams have created a rivalry through a number of playoff series through the years. \n\"Both franchises have had a lot of success for an extended period of time,\" McCrimmon said. \"Most recently we played last year in the Eastern final and based on that, it’s a big game for our players and you know it’s going to be the very same for Calgary.\" \nThe teams have forged an impressive rivalry since Calgary entered the league in 1995-96. \nThey met for the first time in the playoffs in the 1997-98 Eastern final (Brandon won in five). Since then, they played in the 2004-05 Eastern semifinals (Brandon in seven), 2006-07 Eastern semifinals (Calgary in six), 2008-09 Eastern final (Calgary in four), 2009-10 Eastern final (Calgary in five) and 2011-12 Eastern quarter-finals (Brandon in five). \n\"They’ve been a really good team,\" Papirny said. \"They have a really strong back end. For us, we’ve done a really good job of keeping it simple and sticking to our game and that’s worked out. I think we’re more worried about ourselves than the other team.\" \nVeteran Wheat Kings defenceman Colton Waltz said both teams know what to expect tonight. \n\"Calgary is always a strong team and we’re a strong team so we always have good battles with them,\" Waltz said. \"You saw that in the playoffs last year. They’ll be a motivated team.\" \nICINGS: The Hitmen entered the Canadian Hockey League rankings at No. 4 this week, while the Wheat Kings retained their No. 1 spot … Brandon practised on Thursday without C Tim McGauley, who is out week-to-week with an upper-body injury. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:25:32.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
