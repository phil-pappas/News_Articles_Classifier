Ask any Trojans football or basketball fan about that.\nLOS ANGELES — Pat Haden hasn’t had much luck hiring coaches at USC. Ask any Trojans football or basketball fan about that.\nHowever, he has become an expert at firing. Too bad Donald Trump no longer has a reality show.\nSome people still erroneously think Haden is to blame for hiring Lane Kiffin and then setting him loose with his plastic play sheet. Kiffin was the last hiring act of former athletic director Mike Garrett.\nHaden wasn’t afraid to finish Kiffin off, though, jettisoning him not far from where the jets land at LAX after a lopsided loss.\nIf that seems like only yesterday, well, it almost was. It was 2013.\nMonday, under entirely different circumstances, Haden terminated Kiffin’s successor, Steve Sarkisian, another Pete Carroll protege.\nIt was not Haden’s fault that Sarkisian turned out to have a very serious personal issue. Yes, Haden could have more vigorously vetted the coach’s behavior while Sarkisian was the coach at Washington, but nothing in any court document precluded the hire.\nJim Harbaugh and Gary Pinkel survived very public drunken-driving charges to become very successful major college coaches.\nDrinking doesn’t have to interfere with good coaching. Bear Bryant was a drinker and won six national titles at Alabama.\nUSC’s greatest coach, John McKay, held daily court at Julie’s, an establishment near the campus. He was joined between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. on most weeknights by members of the coaching staff and local sportswriters.\n“McKay was a moderate drinker,” said John Hall, a former Los Angeles Times columnist who attended many pub sessions with McKay.\nSarkisian’s problem was different because it could not be controlled or contained. And that necessitated Monday’s move.\nSo, two years after the Kiffin fiasco, USC finds itself looking for a new coach before Halloween.\nMany of the questions then are the questions now: Where does USC turn?\nStarting a search this early is problematic, as many potential candidates are locked in with teams, some with multiple-year contracts.\nThe same old names continue to be the same old names: Mack Brown, Mike Bellotti, Jon Gruden — you know the drill.\nOne thing seems clear: USC needs to break, once and forever, from the Carroll era.\nA major problem with the Sarkisian hire was that he was seen as a knockoff of Kiffin. The two served as co-offensive coordinators during the Carroll heydays.\nUSC needs a clean start.\nChip Kelly raises Twitter noise and might sound like a good idea if the Philadelphia Eagles collapse in the coming weeks. But Kelly is also said to love the NFL, and one reason he left Oregon was he didn’t like dealing with boosters.\nSome people good at reading the Pac-12 Conference standings from top to bottom have suggested Utah’s Kyle Whittingham.\nEveryone loves a winner, right? It’s also no secret Whittingham has had issues with Utah Athletic Director Chris Hill.\nLet’s set this bar: If Utah goes undefeated and wins the national title, USC should definitely give him a call.\nTopping my list this very second would be Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin, a guy many Trojans fans wanted instead of Sarkisian.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:18:51.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
