Happy as heck that we got the win. \n“Probably not the most entertaining (game), but we’ll take the darn win.” \nTennessee fell to 1-3. \nTaylor and co. had as horrendous a first half against the Titans as they did last week at home against the New York Giants. \nLast week: Two first downs, 1-of-8 third-down conversions, 78 total yards, three points. This week: Four first downs, 1-of-6 third-down conversions, 51 total yards, zero points. \nAt least this time the defence kept the Bills in the game. \nThe Buffalo offence finally snapped out of its funk late in third quarter. \nOn a third-and-four from the Buffalo 48, Taylor squeezed out of the pocket on a desperation scramble up the middle and juked his way 26 yards for a first down — the first time the Bills crossed into Tennessee territory all day. \nThat was the ticket: Taylor’s mobility. \nTwo plays later, on a designed quarterback draw, Taylor broke into the clear, cut left, got a great block from receiver Robert Woods — who wiped out two Titans defensive backs — and tight-rope-walked down the left sideline for a nifty 22-yard TD run. \nAfter an ensuing Tennessee field goal, the Bills trailed 13-7. The game’s crucial momentum-changer came a few plays later. \nBuffalo faced third-and-23 at its own seven-yard line, with 8:17 remaining. Bills offensive coordinator Greg Roman then called a great play against Tennessee’s dumb-for-the-situation press-man defensive coverage. \nWith all of his receivers running deep and wide, Taylor dropped as though to throw, then burst up on another designed quarterback draw, into acres of open space. Titans defensive backs had no idea, with their backs to the line of scrimmage, following their receivers. \nTaylor gained 24 yards on the play, just enough for a first down. Even worse for Tennessee, the Titans were flagged for a horse-collar tackle on Taylor, the yank-back of which seemed to injure Taylor’s right leg. \nEJ Manuel came in for a play and handed off to newly acquired Bills back Boom Herron for a yard. Then Taylor returned and promptly dropped a perfectly thrown 46-yard pass into the arms of receiver Chris Hogan flying down the right sideline, down to the Tennessee seven. \nTwo plays after that, Hogan on an end-around threw a little high and wide to Taylor, who’d broken free in the left flat on a trick play. Taylor stuck out one arm and snared the ball one-handed for a four-yard gain. \nOn the next play, third-and-goal at the two, Taylor returned the favour — hitting Hogan for what turned out to be the game-winning pass. \n“Our quarterback’s got the biggest heart,” Ryan said. “Man, it was tough sledding. But, man, he’s got guts, he’s got heart … He’s got such resolve, and that’s the mark of a great one. \n“Now, is he a great quarterback yet? No. But I’m telling you, he’s got those kinds of characteristics that give him a chance to be great.” \nTaylor barely eclipsed the century mark through the air — 109 yards — on 10-of-17 passing, but wasn’t intercepted. He led all rushers with 76 yards. \nUp 14-13, the Bills defence stiffened, forcing a punt and then, with 1:41 left, a game-sealing interception by cornerback Stephon Gilmore of Tennessee’s talented, but finally overwhelmed, rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota. \nNext up for Buffalo: 5-0 Cincinnati at Ralph Wilson Stadium next Sunday. \nEAGLES ROMP \nThere’s no antidote in today’s NFL to a slump, or a struggling offensive line, like the New Orleans Saints defence. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles offence got back on track with a 39-17 homefield smashing of the Saints. \nPhilly improved to 2-3. \n“I have to credit our offensive line, in opening up some things for our guys, and letting our running backs get (space),” Eagles head coach Chip Kelly said. “It started up front. \n“We ran the ball better. And then we converted on third downs.” \nThis is not to say the Eagles were anything like an offensive juggernaut. Quarterback Sam Bradford again had bad moments — badly missing on a pair of fourth-down throws, and tossing two interceptions. \nBut the Eagles’ trio of talented running backs gained 183 yards — DeMarco Murray had 83, Ryan Mathews 73 and Darren Sproles 27 — as the Eagles rang up 34 first downs. \nDrew Brees, achy throwing shoulder and all, passed for 335 yards and two TDs for the Saints (1-4). \nEXTRA POINTS \nLucky for Atlanta PK Matt Bryant his Falcons won in OT. He clunked two field-goal misses off the uprights — first the right, later the left … The Titans safety who was late coming over to break up Hogan’s long late pass from Taylor, in Buffalo’s 14-13 win? Da’Norris Searcy, the former Bill who signed with the Titans in March … Ravens head coach John Harbaugh on the team’s 1-4 start: “We’ll compete, and we’ll fight and we’ll practise and we’ll prepare, and we’ll put the best football team out there we can. And we will expect to win the next time we play.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:05:00.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
