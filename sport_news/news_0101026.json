WALKERAP Pro Football Writer \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Tyrod Taylor threw a touchdown pass, ran for another and even caught a pass in rallying the Buffalo Bills to a 14-13 win over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday. \nWith their top two running backs and top wide receiver out injured, Taylor ran for 77 yards as the Bills (3-2) snapped a five-game skid against Tennessee. \nTaylor ran for a 22-yard TD late in the third quarter after a 26-yard run that was Buffalo's biggest play of the game. Taylor also scrambled for 24 more on third-and-23 from the Bills 7 jumpstarting an 80-yard drive he capped with a 2-yard TD pass to Chris Hogan. Taylor caught a 4-yard pass from Hogan to set up that TD. \nStephon Gilmore intercepted Marcus Mariota's pass with 1:32 left to seal the win. \nThe Titans (1-3) blew a second straight double-digit lead at home. \nOnline: \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nFollow Teresa M.
