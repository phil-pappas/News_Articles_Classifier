Jeff Hackett also did it in the 2003-04 season.\nThe Flyers' last regular-season home loss to Chicago was Nov. 9, 1996, a 4-1 defeat. John LeClair scored the Flyers' goal. Garth Snow was the losing goalie, and Ron Hextall, now the team's general manager, was flawless in nearly 25 minutes of relief.\nYeah, it's been a while.\nNeuvirth's 120 consecutive scoreless minutes at home are the longest ever by a Flyers goalie at the start of the season. Overall, he has a scoreless streak of 132:05.\nWith about 8 1/2 minutes left, Neuvirth made perhaps his best save of the night, denying Jonathan Toews on a rebound while Chicago was on a power play. The Hawks outshot the Flyers, 14-3, in the first 16 minutes of the final period, but Neuvirth had all the answers.\nRead iced the win by scoring on a rebound with 2:35 remaining.\nGiroux knocked in a rebound after Michael Raffl's wraparound was stuffed by goalie Corey Crawford, giving the Flyers a 2-0 lead with 3:39 left in a second period dominated by the home team.\nGiroux didn't score his first even-strength home goal until the 36th Wells Fargo Center game last season, also against Chicago. This year, he did it in the second home game.\nWith the Flyers on a power play, Gagner scored his first goal as a Flyer to give the hosts 1-0 lead with 14:25 left in the second. From just above the right circle, Gagner beat Crawford with a well-placed wrist shot.\nFour minutes later, Neuvirth stopped Marian Hossa on a shorthanded breakaway, keeping the Flyers ahead.\nNeuvirth, coming off a 1-0 win over Florida and making his second straight start because Steve Mason was dealing with a personal matter, made six saves in a scoreless first period, including close shots by Artem Anisimov and Patrick Kane.\nKane was booed and/or serenaded with unflattering chants every time he touched the puck. The star winger is under investigation for his role in an alleged sexual assault but has not been charged.\nThe Flyers nearly took an early lead while on a power play, but Giroux's one-time blast from the left circle caromed off the right post with about 10 1/2 minutes left in the opening period. Giroux's line, with wingers Raffl and Jake Voracek, entered the night with no goals in the first three games and just one point combined.\nGiroux changed that in the second period.\nBefore the game, rookie coach Dave Hakstol, whose team managed just four goals in the first three games, said he was unconcerned by the first line's struggles.\n\"They've started to create a lot of opportunities ... especially the last game and half,\" Hakstol said. \"They're doing a lot of the right things.\"\nIt was the first time Chicago captain Toews had played against a team coached by Hakstol, his college coach at North Dakota.\n\"You could feel his eyes on the back of your head when you were sitting on the bench if you knew you did something wrong,\" Toews joked after the morning skate. \"I think he was always fair and did whatever it took to win.\"\nChicago slipped to 2-2. The Flyers have won two straight since a 7-1 spanking in Florida.\nThanks to the NHL's quirky schedule, the Flyers will have a five-day break before their next game, Tuesday against visiting Dallas.\nThey go into that break feeling good about themselves.\n(c)2015 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1737852", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1737852&h=Flyers+defeat+Blackhawks+as+Neuvirth+posts+another+shutout", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1737852&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:04:33.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
