That is a good question.\nIn my twenties, I was diagnosed with beriberi, which caused nerve and muscle abnormalities due to a vitamin B1 deficiency. Vitamin B1 is important for our bodies to maintain metabolism of sugars and proteins and plays an important role in improving cardiovascular function and maintaining our central nervous system.\nA few years later, I started volunteering for a local hospital that later became my employer. People often think that volunteering is something that nice people do but volunteers are not that important in the scheme of things. This couldn’t be further from the truth.\nWhether you are an active volunteer or just give a few hours of your time; volunteers are critical partners for organizations to operate.\nAs you can see, vitamin B1 is essential for our health . To experience the\nbenefits of volunteering, B1!\nSchools, churches, shelters of all types, athletics (the list goes on and on) would not run as smoothly without volunteers. If the organization runs completely by volunteers, it would not exist.\nIf you paid for the services provide by volunteers, your budget would take an enormous hit. The impact on the health and well-being of communities worldwide would suffer if there were no volunteers.\nI am reminded of being a small child and going Trick-or-Treat for United Nations International Children's Emergency, “UNICEF founded in 1946 to help children suffering in the aftermath of World War II, UNICEF provides children and families with disaster relief whenever emergencies strike.” Worldwide, volunteers are there to repair infrastructures.\nVolunteering has surprising benefits. “With busy lives, it can be hard to find time to volunteer. However, the benefits of volunteering are enormous to you, your family, and your community. The right match can help you find friends and… can also help protect your mental and physical health.” ~~~ from Volunteering and its Surprising Benefits--Helping Others While Helping Yourself\nWith fall around he corner and winter on its way, is a time when many start to give thought about those less fortunate than they are.\nNovember 14-22, 2015, “ National Hunger & Homelessness Awareness Week is held each year the week before Thanksgiving. This is a time for us all to start to think about what we are thankful for, a perfect time to share our compassion with our neighbors who are experiencing homelessness, and work toward a world where no one has to experience Hunger and Homelessness.\nBefore re-igniting LIGHTFEST, We Survive did an annual Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week event. LIGHTFEST Re-Ignited took the place of the event, believing that communities need to be educated on what exactly hunger and homelessness means and its impact on communities.\nLIGHTFEST Re-ignited has become a worldwide movement. There are many ways people can become involved with this people power-driven effort.\nWouldn’t it be wonderful if we could eradicate hunger and homelessness!!\nBecome a volunteer. Take the first step and \"brighten impoverished lives by displaying a Light of Hope wherever you are on November 7, 2015 at 6pm Eastern Time, It can be a porch light, candle, cell phone, or flashlight. Join others around the world in celebrating the LIGHTFEST Re-Ignited movement!\" LIGHTFEST Re-Ignited Invitation Video\nFYI---\nAct Out for Kids is setting LIGHTFEST Re-Ignited AGLOW with their video.\nSharon Cecil, RN", "external_links": ["http://www.helpguide.org/articles/work-career/volunteering-and-its-surprising-benefits.htm", "http://lightfestreignited.info/", "http://www.unicefusa.org/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY4JddoY_lo", "http://nationalhomeless.org/about-us/projects/awareness-week/"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:49:59.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
