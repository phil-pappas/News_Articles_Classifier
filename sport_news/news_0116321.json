Her fiance is turned off when she cuddles with her mom Abby, I have been with this man for 12 years. I had suspected affairs before, but he always came up with convincing answers and fooled me into thinking it was nothing.\nI guess I'm naive - or him being a cop has taught him how to lie and cleverly manipulate.\nI have two children, and, of course, I left him. I haven't told my son why I divorced his dad because I don't want him to have a bad opinion of him.\nI need advice. I'm now struggling and barely making ends meet. My son is mad at me because I can't fix my relationship with his father.\nWe are having a hard time, but my ex isn't. He's living it up while staying with relatives. He cancels visits with his son at the last minute to spend time with other women.\nI try not to get angry, because no matter how I'm hurting I know I'm better off without him.\nHow do I let the anger go?\nRomantically, I feel I have moved on, but another part of me feels he should suffer too.\n- Angry in the South\nDEAR ANGRY: Nobody likes to be played for a fool, and you wouldn't be human if you didn't have these feelings.\nHowever, resist the temptation to be vengeful. Your ex may suffer when your son is old enough to realize that he can't count on his dad to keep his word or be there for him.\nBide your time. While you shouldn't poison the children against him, do let them draw their own conclusions.\nHer past follows her DEAR ABBY: Ten years ago, while I was still in college, I dated and fell in love with a married man I'll call \"Jon.\" The split was messy in the end, but since then we have had our closure and moved on with our lives - divorce for him, and marriage for me.\nI recently learned that Jon may be taking a position in my small company (only nine people). I believe we can be cordial, but should I approach the subject with him, or pretend it never happened?\nDo I tell my husband (who knows about the affair) that Jon will be working with me, or keep quiet?\n- Conflicted in California\nDEAR CONFLICTED: Of course you tell your husband. If you don't and he finds out Jon will be working with you, he will assume that you had something to hide.\nAs to bringing up the past with Jon once he shows up, if he doesn't broach the subject, I don't think you should.\nKeep the relationship strictly business, for both your sakes.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.
