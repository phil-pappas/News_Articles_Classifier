The fact that most of them don't drink (alcohol) was really refreshing. \n\n\"You didn't get anybody screaming out 'You da man' or 'get in the hole' like they do in the States when they've had too much to drink. It made it very pleasant for the players. \n\n\"They were appreciative of both teams and applauded good shots. Of course, you could tell who they were supporting, but it never once stepped over the line.\" \n\nHaas said hosting the Presidents Cup had been like a test event for Asia, and it had passed with flying colours. \n\n\"Whether it's here, Japan or wherever they go, it should come back. This week has been a great proving ground for all of Asia to say we can do that, we can do it better.\" \n\nAnd Haas would like nothing better than for it to return to the same venue in eight years time. \n\n\"Just the logistics of it -- the hotel is right there we can see it (from the course) -- the city, the food and the people have been fantastic. \n\n\"But I do understand that if it comes back to Asia there are going to be other countries that will want to give it a try.\" \n\nThe close encounter and thrilling denouement breathed welcome new life into the Presidents Cup after a succession of runaway victories for the US. \n\nIt was played in the true spirit of the game without the rancour or rampant jingoism that so often mars the Ryder Cup between the US and Europe. \n\nChris Kirk \"hated\" when he won his pivotal match when Anirban Lahiri missed a tiny putt on 18. And Bill Haas said he really felt for the crestfallen local hero Bae. \n\nPlayers shook hands instead of slapping high fives and the sense of mutual respect was palpable.
