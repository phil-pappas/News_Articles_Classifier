They lost the first two games of their AL Division Series against the Texas Rangers before storming back to win the final three.\nThe Blue Jays will send David Price, their number one starter to the mound, for Game Two while Kansas City will start right-hander Yordano Ventura.\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:31:19.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
