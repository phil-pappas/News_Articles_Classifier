Football Super 10 stays stagnant ahead of huge Week 8 \nFollowing Friday’s home game with Washington, City High will wrap up the regular season at No. 10 Muscatine (6-1, 2-1). \n“It’s a fun thing and we have to take one at a time, but we have two 6-1 teams here to finish out our district,” Sabers said. “The cream should come to the top that is for sure.” \nThe Little Hawks have been perfect following back-to-back losses to Cedar Falls and Bettendorf to open the season. \nCity High turned in its most complete effort of the season on Friday against Burlington. \nThe Little Hawks rolled up season highs of 469 yards of total offense and 38 points in the win while posting its first shutout in 33 games. \nCity High’s last shutout, a 38-0 win over Cedar Rapids Jefferson, came Sept. 14, 2012. \n“I feel good about where we are at and what we are about as a team and how we care about each other,” Sabers said. “We are playing the game right now with a lot of enthusiasm and those are all good things.” \nCity High will now prepare for the regular-season stretch that begins with defending Class 4A runner-up Cedar Rapids Washington on Friday. \nThe Warriors have won five straight games since a Week 2 loss to Cedar Rapids Kennedy and have outscored three district opponents 127-42. \n“They know what winning championships is all about, they did it last year in the district,” Sabers said. “They present a lot of problems for you, but at the same time I like where we are at.” \nOFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE WEEK: West High senior Oliver Martin caught five passes for 164 yards and two touchdowns and also returned a punt 67 yards for a score in a 63-27 win over Dubuque Hempstead . \nMartin had touchdown grabs of 65 and 75 yards and averaged 34.5 yards on four punt returns. \nRUNNER-UP: Jared Taylor keeps clicking as the City High starting quarter. The junior completed 11 of 16 passes for 191 yards and two touchdowns in a 38-0 win over Burlington. \nTaylor threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to Charles Johnson and a 34-yarder to Jason Jones as the junior quarterback notched his fourth game of at least two touchdown passes. \nDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE WEEK: Erick Fletcher, Charles Johnson, Brady Bigley and every member of the City High defense can share the honor this week. \nThe City High defense limited Burlington to 72 total yards and five first downs in a 38-0 win. \nFletcher, a senior captain, led City High with 3.5 tackles, including one for loss. \nJohnson had two tackles for loss and Bigley picked off a pass for the Little Hawks. \nRUNNER-UP: Lone Tree senior defensive lineman Caleb Feldman had three sacks among his nine tackles in a 35-20 loss to No. 10 Pekin. \nReach Ryan Murken at 319-339-7369 or rmurken@press-citizen.com and follow him on Twitter at @rmmurken.
