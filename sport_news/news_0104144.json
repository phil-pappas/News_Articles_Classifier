(Photo: Anne-Marie Sorvin, USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE CALGARY, Alberta (AP) â€” Mark Giordano scored his second goal of the game in overtime and the Calgary Flames came back to end a four-game losing streak with a 3-2 win over the struggling Detroit Red Wings.\nJoe Colborne tied it for Calgary with 1:12 left in the third period. Giordano scored 3:12 into overtime to give Calgary its first win in five home games this season.\nGustav Nyquist and Brendan Smith scored first-period power-play goals as Detroit lost its fourth straight. Jimmy Howard had 37 stops for the Red Wings (3-3-1).\nGiordano tied it 1-1 with a goal 11:02 into the first. He also had an assist and seven shots on goal.\nJohnny Gaudreau assisted on each of Giordano's goals, and Jiri Hudler also had two assists.\nJonas Hiller made 27 saves for the Flames (2-5-0).\nNyquist opened the scoring at 7:38 of the first period when he converted a feed from Henrik Zetterberg to finish off a great passing play during a Detroit man advantage.\nGiordano answered shortly after with his second goal in as many games when he took a pass from Gaudreau and wired a point shot past Howard.\nUSA TODAY\nNHL Eastern Conference: Why your favorite team will win the Stanley Cup\nJust 8 seconds after his goal, Giordano took a costly delay of game penalty. The Red Wings regained the lead on the ensuing power play when Smith's point shot snuck past Hiller, who was screened by Detroit forward Riley Sheahan on the play.\nDespite outshooting the Red Wings 16-4 in the second period, the Flames weren't able to get any pucks past Howard.\nCalgary forward Mason Raymond had the best chance in the second, but his wrist shot ricocheted off both Howard and the post. The puck then landed on Howard's left pad and he was able to cover it up before Mikael Backlund could get his stick on it.\nThe Flames kept pouring on the pressure in the third period, when Howard stopped a breakaway attempt by Josh Jooris.\nUSA TODAY\nNHL Eastern Conference: Why your favorite team won't win the Stanley Cup\nNot to be outdone, Hiller made a pair of nice blocker saves on scoring attempts by Dylan Larkin and Tomas Tatar to keep the Flames in the game.\nColborne was able to tip a Giordano point shot past Howard.\nNotes: Defenseman Ladislav Smid made his season debut with the Flames after sitting out Calgary's first six games with a neck injury. . Prior to Friday, the last time Smid dressed for the Flames was last season on Jan. 19 when the Flames had a 2-1 overtime victory over the L.A. Kings. . Flames goalie Karri Ramo cleared waivers on Thursday and was assigned to the AHL's Stockton Heat, making way for Joni Ortio to dress for his first game this season as Hiller's backup. . Red Wings forward Brad Richards missed Friday's game due to a back injury, meaning that fellow center Joakim Andersson drew into Detroit's lineup for his second game this season.\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
