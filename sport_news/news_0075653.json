As noted in the story, moose are a “north woods” species that require a good deal of room. Only bad things happen when these giant ruminants move into populated areas with highways. Moose are the largest member of the genus Cervidae, a branch of the hoofed mammal clan that has antlers derived from bone, that are shed and regrown on an annual basis. Cows and their cousins — sheep, goats and buffalo — grow horns derived evolutionarily from hair that grows continuously throughout their lives and are not shed. Hunters, hikers, naturalists and nature lovers will go out late in the fall and early winter looking for shed antlers from deer and moose to collect for various reasons ranging from proof of the big buck they saw during the hunting season to practical uses such as bone handles for knives. In the case of the moose, to provide a canvas on which to paint. Moose are huge animals that can weigh more than half a ton. That influences the number and location of hunting permits issued in northern New England. They have to monitor the number of moose living near highways to keep people safe. Shooting moose near roads is to a large degree what must be done. Regulations often require bringing the entire animal in to check stations, so they have to be killed in places accessible to vehicles and quads. Every so often a moose wanders down into this region in search of territory or possibly for a mate during the rut. During the 1970s, a moose showed up on Route 32 near Connecticut College and the Coast Guard Academy in New London. Because of the high volume of traffic in that area, it was quickly tranquilized in order to move it to a remote part of the state where it would have a chance to survive. Unfortunately, the stresses on the animal combined with a possible overdose killed it. Historically, moose and wild turkey were preyed on primarily by wolves, bobcats and the occasional black bear or mountain lion. All of these mammals created a balance and thrived in New England’s woodlands. Over the past few centuries, that has changed. Early settlers eliminated predators and land use practices since has changed the landscape. Our woodlands now support deer, wild turkey and coyotes, with a growing population of black bear and an occasional wandering moose. In 2013, I drew a Vermont moose permit via a lottery system after decades of nonrefundable, failed attempts at New England moose hunting. I took a small yearling that weighed 427 pounds. It was interesting because there were more than a hundred people in the parking lot to see these gigantic animals as they were brought to the checking station. Page 2 of 2 - Over the years, while traveling and fishing in some very remote places in Maine and Canada, seeing a moose was always a thrill. A couple of incidents stick out in my mind. While musky fishing on Baker Lake in Maine during the early 90s, Eric Covino and I were at one end of the 1,000-acre lake when Eric said, “I didn’t think there was anyone else on the lake.” I looked where he was pointing and didn’t see anything. He said they were in a small boat or canoe. Then I saw a dark form at water level that did look like the stern of a small boat. It turned out to be a huge bull moose that was wading neck deep while feeding on lily pads. When it faced in our direction, it’s huge antlers — probably 4- or 5-feet across — made it resemble the back of a boat. We made a run across the lake in an effort to get a photo of the giant moose. Unfortunately, the photos were blurry, due to what I call “self wake-ulation”, when the wave action from a running boat catches up and rocks the boat just in time to ruin photographs. Years later while fishing in Ontario, Canada, my son Jared and I saw a cow and calf swim across the lake. We putted over to take a photo or two from a safe distance for all concerned. When we got in the wake of the rapidly swimming animals, we were instantly covered by a huge swarm of hungry biting flies that moose were seeking refuge from. We slapped at the flies with our hats, revved up the tiny outboard and employed a trick that a Canadian guide named Chopper showed me. When the flies and/or mosquitoes become too much to bear, run the boat. The bugs that don’t get left behind seek refuge under the seats and bow. When they hide, take a can of Raid Flying Insect Killer and hit those pockets under the seats to eliminate the biting insects. After a half quart of lost blood via dozens of bites, we resumed casting for the pike we were targeting in that remote lake until the float plane came in to retrieve us for the evening.
