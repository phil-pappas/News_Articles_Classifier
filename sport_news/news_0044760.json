They now head to Owensville, who beat Eldon in the district standings by the narrowest margin, after taking down Southern Boone last week. Eldon’s defense has now been the defining factor of two straight victories and head coach Shannon Jolley has loved what he’s seen the last two weeks. \n“We didn’t have any real big monster plays on offense, so I think the defense stepped up a little bit and kind of dictated the tempo of the game and made some key stops and made it really tough on them,” Jolley said of the Southern Boone game. \nThe Mustangs have been hitting home runs offensively all season long, but in the last two weeks teams have slowed them down. This offense has adjusted well to not having the big play to rely on. \n“You have to, sometimes you have to figure it out,” Jolley said. “You have to get a rhythm of what the other team is doing defensively so you can react to what you’re going to call offensively.” \nThe defense will need to step up again in the first round of district play as the Mustangs travel to Owensville. The Dutchmen have a high-powered offense built around their quarterback Wyatt Ellis. Ellis has thrown for about 1,600 yards and has added 722 on the ground. He has a total of 24 touchdowns and hasn’t turned the ball over often, as he has only thrown two interceptions. It will be important for the Mustangs to slow him down. \n“Coming into Week 10, Owensville has an effective passing game,” Jolly said. “So that will be another challenge, a team that’s more pass heavy. We’ve been pretty fortunate to be strong against the run. This week we really have to step our game up in the secondary and keep getting better.” \nThe challenge Eldon will have is Ellis doesn’t lock in on one receiver, he has a number of players that he spreads the ball around to in order to stretch out the defense. Ellis has also been extremely successful running the football, so he can beat you in several different ways. But at the end of the day, he’s just one guy. \n“The good thing about that is he’s one person,” Jolley said. “He’s got some good receivers and things like that, but when you take a talented kid like that, you can kinda zero in a little bit on him and you know making sure he’s a priority that you either get to or you’re defending well.” \nAnd that pass defense will be crucial. If the Mustangs want to keep up with Owensville’s offense, they’ll need to improve in the secondary. If this team has had one weakness defensively, it would be defending the pass. Jolley sees his secondary as the key to winning this game. \n“I think the one area is going to be pass defense,” said Jolley. “If we can defend the pass and put pressure on the quarterback, then we’ll be in good shape (tonight), but those two things have to happen.” \nThe Mustangs will have to play on the road. In an exciting playoff atmosphere this can be seen as a big disadvantage, but Jolley thinks his team is as prepared as any team to compete on the road in an elimination game. \n“They travel well, we do okay,” he said. “I just don’t think that’s part of the distraction.” \nWhile Owensville has a 4-5 record, Jolley knows it is a talented opponent. In an elimination game, you have to be prepared for anything. \nThe Mustangs are looking forward to that challenge tonight. \n“I think Owensville is a great football team, I think they’re better than a 4-5 team and I think we’re gonna find out (tonight),” Jolley said. “And like I said, any time you’re in an elimination situation, anything can happen.” \nEldon at Owensville - Updates on Twitter: @EldonMustang , @owenathletics and @GCRepublican \nPodcast", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:38:26.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
