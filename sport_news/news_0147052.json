Jordan’s Week 7 Recap Record last week & overall record: 26-5, 186-40 Missed on: Willard over Republic Camdenton over Waynesville McDonald County over Seneca Ava over Thayer Do over of the week: Ava over Thayer. Every week I pick against Thayer and every week they win. I probably should just stop picking against them. The Bobcats are for real. Whiff of the week: Camdenton over Waynesville. I’m not sure too many people saw this coming, but moving Seth Hedrick to wide receiver has been a huge move. Ethan Brown has played lights out at quarterback and those sophomores aren’t playing like it anymore. Waynesville will be scary come district time. Best pick: Mount Vernon over Cassville. The ‘Neers got out of the gate with Carl Junction and Lamar, which is just brutal, but they are much better than their record indicates. The offense is balanced and sneakily explosive; they could be a darkhorse in Class 3. Joboo’s Week 7 Recap Record last week & overall record: 26-5, 183-43 Missed on: Willard over Republic Camdenton over Waynesville Glendale over Rolla Lebanon over Joplin Do over of the week: Cassville over Mt. Vernon. Tough call here. Willard/Republic was really a tossup. And no one could foresee 6 turnovers from Glendale. The Cassville offense has been anemic against solid teams and Mt. Vernon is solid. Should have backed off from picking the Wildcats on the road. Whiff of the week: Lebanon over Joplin. #1 – I thought it would be a close game. It wasn’t. #2 – While I didn’t think the Yellowjackets were a lock, I thought homecoming night would help give them the edge. I was wrong on both counts as Joplin rolled. Best pick: Thayer over Ava. These two teams have been waging war ever since Thayer reentered the SCA for football with almost every game tightly contested. Thayer scored twice through the air, 3 times on the ground, and their defense was nails after falling behind 12-6. VIDEO: Top Plays of Week 7 Week 8 Picks Jordan’s Bold prediction: Central over Reeds Spring. To be fair, Reeds is good. But, this just an awkward matchup for them. The Wolves have given up a total of 53 points in seven games, but they haven’t seen an offense like the one Central will bring on Friday. It’ll be another tight one, but Central ends Reeds’ unbeaten start with their fourth consecutive win. Joboo’s Bold prediction: Glendale over Waynesville – The Tigers are making progress in bursts as last week’s win over Camdenton shows. And Seth Hedrick is a definite playmaker on offense. But the Tigers have been vulnerable through the air. I think the Falcons passing attack will be too much. Jordan’s Toughest call: Skyline over Marionville – Marionville is banged up and on the road, but for some reason I’m still drinking the Kool-Aid (see what I did there?). The Comets rolled last year, 48-21 and even 40-26 the year before. But, with multiple two-way starters out and the status of Tanner Wright unknown, I have to go with the Tigers. They’re super athletic and have a ton of weapons, but they’ll have to take care of the ball against a fundamental Jamie LaSalle team. But, if both teams were at 100%, I would have to give the edge to Marionville. Joboo’s Toughest call: Hollister over Rogersville – It’s not always the high profile games that are tough to pick. What to choose from here? Rogersville pitched a shutout in getting their lone win, but has given up 54 points per game in their 6 losses. Hollister has scored twice as much as the Wildcats, but 75% of it came in their 2 wins. I think the Tigers get better line play and get the W. VIDEO: In the Zone - Week 8 Preview Full Week 8 Picks Ash Grove at Fair Grove Jordan’s Pick: Fair Grove – The Eagles are huge upfront and coming off of a narrow loss to Marionville, I think they are starting to realize how good they can be. I love Jackson Bagley, but keep an eye on this Dalton Cloyd kid. Joboo’s Pick: Fair Grove – A big game for district positioning. The Eagles need to keep pace with Diamond. The Pirates could pick up the inside track to the #3 seed with a win. Bolivar at Springfield Catholic Jordan’s Pick: Bolivar – Bolivar. Lance Roweton. Points. Wins. Joboo’s Pick: Bolivar – The Liberators reward if they finish 8-1 and win the COC Small will likely be a #4 district seed and a semifinal matchup with Webb City. Cabool at Ava Jordan’s Pick: Ava – The Bears hit a rut, playing Grove, Liberty and Thayer so close together. They’ll get back on track this week. Joboo’s Pick: Ava – No game is truly a lock, but the Bears look like they’ll be able to cruise into districts well rested. Cabool is hoping to avoid the 0-fer. Camdenton at Joplin Jordan’s Pick: Joplin – The Lakers have struggled with spread attacks and the Eagles come at you in waves and have some big-time weapons in the passing games. Darrian Guillory is averaging 30 yards per catch and is a game-changer. Joboo’s Pick: Joplin – The Eagles are playing well right now and their offensive attack is custom fit to some points up against the Laker defense. It could be a high scoring affair, but Joplin should prevail. Midway at Lighthouse Christian Jordan’s Pick: Lighthouse Christian – At this point we’ve establish that LC is a pretty good team. Midway hasn’t seen many lines as big as the Chargers and they likely won’t see a Ben Friend type this year. Joboo’s Pick: Lighthouse Christian – The Vikings have 3 shutouts in the last 4 games. But also lost 36-20 to Butler 2 weeks ago. This should be a battle, but I like how the Chargers match up with Midway better. Clinton at Monett Jordan’s Pick: Monett – Clinton has scored more than 20 points once all year. Monett has given up more than 20 twice (Lamar and Carl Junction). This has shutout written all over it. Joboo’s Pick: Monett – While Clinton is not a pushover, they do struggle to score and that will not fly against the Cubs defense. Diamond at Liberal Jordan’s Pick: Diamond – This team has played phenomenal football all year long. They should end the season with a pair of wins. Joboo’s Pick: Diamond – Only Lockwood and Jasper have defeated the revitalized Wildcats who are in a dogfight with Fair Grove for the second seed in their class 2 district. DISTRICT FOOTBALL STANDINGS - CLICK HERE East Newton at Cassville Jordan’s Pick: Cassville – The Cats have dropped four straight. But, East Newton at home is just what the doctor ordered. Joboo’s Pick: Cassville – This is now a must win if the Wildcats want to host a district game. And with some help they could still jump up to the No. 3 seed. Kickapoo at Lebanon Jordan’s Pick: Kickapoo – The Jackets aren’t bad, but playing one of the best teams in Class 4 on the road, followed with back-to-back games against two of the state’s biggest schools is tough. Kickapoo just has too much. Joboo’s Pick: Kickapoo – The Chiefs have shown they are the cream of the Ozark Conference. Lebanon can still give them a good game, but Kickapoo looks dialed in. Lamar at Aurora Jordan’s Pick: Lamar – Lamar wins this game, but Aurora has some pieces that could give the Tigers some problems, especially in the passing game. Scott Bailey loves playing man-to-man and Peyton Evans is out here throwing darts, with Billy Meredith and Skylar Cahill, as well as tight end Logan Bader all being great targets. But, have you seen Jed Stahl play defense? Joboo’s Pick: Lamar – With losses to Monett & Cassville, Aurora seems doomed to fall in the district standings. While Lamar wants another shot at an elusive Big 8 championship. Lockwood at Miller Jordan’s Pick: Lockwood – Even with a banged up Kyle Bouldin, Lockwood has more than enough to win this game. But, the Tigers better keep an eye on Dylan Hill or this one could get tricky. Joboo’s Pick: Lockwood – Pick your poison with Lockwood. Ben Schnelle or Kyle Bouldin. Either one can beat you, and combined they are brutal. Marionville at Skyline Jordan’s Pick: Skyline – She Jordan’s Toughest Call above. Joboo’s Pick: Marionville – A great matchup. Skyline brings more weapons than the Comets have faced all year. Marionville brings more physicality on both sides of the ball than the Tigers have seen all year. Marshfield at Buffalo Jordan’s Pick: Marshfield – Their offense isn’t bad at all and the Buffalo defense has struggled with spread teams. Jays win. Joboo’s Pick: Marshfield – The Jays have shown some encouraging signs, and with a win over Buffalo and next week over Springfield Catholic, they can finish 3rd in the COC Small. McDonald County at Mount Vernon Jordan’s Pick: Mount Vernon – They are finally starting to put it together. That offense will help make it three straight wins this week. Joboo’s Pick: Mt. Vernon – If they can avoid a letdown after beating Cassville, a win for the Mountaineers could secure their best Big 8 finish since 2010. STATEWIDE MEDIA FOOTBALL RANKINGS - CLICK HERE Mountain Grove at Houston Jordan’s Pick: Mountain Grove – The Panthers have struggled in the last few weeks and going to Houston won’t be easy, especially if they’re looking ahead to Thayer. Joboo’s Pick: Mountain Grove – It’s been a good season for Houston, but they finish with the twin titans in the SCA. We’ll find out how far they’ve really come. Neosho at Republic Jordan’s Pick: Neosho – Devin Hames and Jerney Jones are two of the best in the conference. I’m not sure either defense will be able to stop the other, but this Neosho team has figured out how to win this year. Wildcats win a close one. Joboo’s Pick: Republic – How good is the COC Large this year? The loser of this game could finish as low as 6th in the standings and still end up in the state semifinals. And next year Carl Junction is coming aboard. Yikes. Nevada at Warrensburg Jordan’s Pick: Nevada – This has been an impossible team to figure out, but Warrensburg hasn’t won a game since late August. Chaden Brandt is still pretty good. Joboo’s Pick: Nevada – This is a tight matchup any way you cut it. But Nevada has been solid on the road and is playing better ball right now. I’ll take the Tigers. Nixa at Carthage Jordan’s Pick: Nixa – The Eagles haven’t looked good lately, and Carthage has no shortage of motivation considering Nixa’s won three of four. But, Nixa gets a big road win here. Joboo’s Pick: Carthage – Even with a healthy Logan Tyler, I’ll take the Tigers. They continue to prove that they have a program in place that is bigger than the players they have. Coach Jon Guidie doesn’t get enough press. Osceola at Cole Camp Jordan’s Pick: Osceola – Here we are again late in the season and Osceola is playing meaningful football again. I like Marek Thompson to plug the run against a Cole Camp team that can’t throw it. Indians win. Joboo’s Pick: Osceola – The Indians are WEMO co-champs after beating Adrian last week and seem pretty locked in to the 5 seed in their district. But they’ll want to keep their momentum going. Cole Camp will be a challenge. Parkview at West Plains Jordan’s Pick: West Plains – I think this one is much tighter than it may seem on paper, specifically with the injuries West Plains has suffered defensive and how well the Vikings are running the football. But, I like the Zizzer offense to keep Parkview off balance. Joboo’s Pick: West Plains – Yes, the Vikings are playing well. And yes, the Zizzers have some injuries on defense to deal with. But I think they have enough offense to still win this game. Rolla at Hillcrest Jordan’s Pick: Rolla – The Bulldogs may be on to something with this passing game. Look for Brown to Chrisco to be the difference for Rolla. Joboo’s Pick: Rolla – The Bulldogs haven’t won a road game since 2013. But the Hornets have been very suspect on pass defense. MAKE YOUR PICKS FOR WEEK 8 FOR A CHANCE TO WIN FREE ANDY'S - CLICK HERE Salem at MV-BT/Liberty Jordan’s Pick: MV-BT/Liberty – The Eagles are just better than everyone in the SCA. I like Salem, but not this week. Joboo’s Pick: Mt. View-Liberty – With only 2 games between them and another SCA title and undefeated regular season, I can’t see the Eagles slipping now. Sarcoxie at Butler Jordan’s Pick: Butler – Sarcoxie has lost four straight and playing one of the best teams in Class 2 won’t help. Joboo’s Pick: Butler – Butler made things interesting against Lamar for a while. I can’t see Sarcoxie being able to handle them. Seneca at Carl Junction Jordan’s Pick: Carl Junction – It’s senior night, the Bulldogs’ final in the Big 8, and they’re going to go out with a bang. Joboo’s Pick: Carl Junction – After turbo clocking Monett, Carl Junction looks primed to exit the Big 8 with 3 straight conference titles. Central at Reeds Spring Jordan Central: Central – See Jordan’s Bold Prediction above. Joboo’s Pick: Reeds Spring – Last season’s game was a 13-6 win for Reeds Spring so I don’t think the Wolves will be looking past Central. Neither team has been in a close game since the first 2 weeks, but if it comes down to the wire, I think Reeds Spring has a slight edge. Stockton at Pleasant Hope Jordan’s Pick: Stockton – I don’t think this team is nearly as bad as the record indicates and the schedule has done them no favors. I like the Tigers to get back on track here. Joboo’s Pick: Stockton – Since beating Strafford in week 4, the Tigers have been in free fall mode. But they’ve played better each week and should get back in the win column. Strafford at El Dorado Springs Jordan’s Pick: Strafford – Lance Molz returning to form makes this one much more interesting than it would have been a month ago, but Strafford is starting to figure things out, especially defensively. Plus, Sam Morton and Jacob Eden are great against the run. Joboo’s Pick: Strafford – I’m going with who needs this more. The Bulldogs seem locked into the #5 spot in their district. While Strafford has a very real shot to climb to the #4 spot. Plus they’ve been playing better the last 3 weeks. Webb City at Ozark Jordan’s Pick: Webb City – There’s a reason that the Cards haven’t dropped a COC Large game. That won’t change this week. Joboo’s Pick: Webb City – The Tigers go from facing their bitter rival to facing the best team in Missouri. And with Tyson Roderique back, they keep getting better. Willard at Branson Jordan’s Pick: Willard – Branson is playing much better football as of late, but with Willard coming off of a tough loss to Republic and needing the district points, I like the Tigers. Joboo’s Pick: Willard – Even in a losing cause last week, Hunter Yeargan was huge. The Tigers should get back on the winning track against the Pirates. Willow Springs at Thayer Jordan’s Pick: Thayer – I am done Thayer. Bobcats roll. Joboo’s Pick: Thayer – Marionville and Skyline are drawing the attention in class 1 locally. But if you look at how they each performed against Strafford, the Bobcats are just as good. Windsor at Jasper Jordan’s Pick: Jasper – I’ve been high on this team all year and they’ve done nothing to shake my confidence in them. They got in the rankings this week, and they’ll be undefeated entering next week’s game with Lockwood. Joboo’s Pick: Jasper – Windsor is better than their 2-4 record, but Jasper should still be able to take care of them easily. Hollister at Rogersville Jordan’s Pick: Rogersville – The Cats haven’t played well and have just one win all year, but I like Rogersville to get things going this week. Joboo’s Pick: Hollister – See Joboo’s Toughest Call above. Waynesville at Glendale Jordan’s Pick: Waynesville – These Tigers are finally becoming the dangerous team I thought they could be entering the year. They have enough athletes to defend the perimeter passing game and will have no problem scoring points. It’ll be a shootout, but Waynesville wins. Joboo’s Pick: Glendale – See Joboo’s Bold Prediction above.
