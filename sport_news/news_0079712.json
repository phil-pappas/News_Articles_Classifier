The Cougars favor the pass, while Stanford (6-1, 5-0), which has a 1ï»¿1/2-game lead in the division, prefers the power running game with a complementary passing attack. \nStanford's balance was on display Saturday as it topped the 30-point mark for the sixth consecutive game and churned for 478 yards against the league's stingiest defense. Its point total was the highest Washington has allowed this season. \n\"We're getting into a rhythm offensively,\" quarterback Kevin Hogan said. \"We're hard to predict right now.\" \nFresh from a record-breaking performance against UCLA, Stanford sophomore tailback Christian McCaffrey finished with 300 all-purpose yards. The total included 109 yards rushing and a 50-yard touchdown catch. \nMcCaffrey has five consecutive 100-yard rushing games, tied for the second longest streak in school history. (Toby Gerhart holds the record, with seven.) \n\"It all starts with the guys up front,\" McCaffrey said. \nHogan was intercepted late in the fourth quarter but was otherwise sharp, completing 17 of 24 passes for 290 yards and two touchdowns. Advertisement \nThe Cardinal possessed the ball for 40 minutes, averaged 6.6 yards per play and successfully converted 8 of 16 third- and fourth-down opportunities. \n\"They don't give up a lot of big plays,\" Stanford coach David Shaw said of the Huskies. \"We knew it would have to be eight-, nine-, 10-play drives. We would have to be methodical.\" \nStanford's defense, which faced an inexperienced quarterback for the sixth time this season, was equally dominant. \nThe Cardinal overwhelmed UW's K.J. Carta-Samuels, a freshman from Bellarmine College Prep-San Jose who replaced injured starter Jake Browning. \nCarta-Samuels completed 9 of 21 passes for 118 yards, the majority of which came long after the outcome had been determined. \nStanford wasted no time taking control, ripping off an impressive opening drive that covered 62 yards in six plays. It featured two runs by Hogan, who looked to have full strength in his left ankle for the first time since suffering a sprain in the Week 3 win at USC. He never hesitated to tuck and run and was willing to take on would-be tacklers. \nThe final play of the drive was one of Stanford's most creative of the season, with Hogan rolling right, faking a pitch to McCaffrey and then stepping back to throw a strike to tight end Austin Hooper for a 21-yard touchdown. \nThe Cardinal added to its lead early in the second quarter, when Remound Wright plowed into the end zone to cap a 15-play, 90-yard drive -- Stanford's longest of the season. \nIt included a 24-yard catch-and-run by McCaffrey on second-and-19 and a pass interference penalty on the Huskies. Stanford also converted a fourth down, as McCaffrey charged for 7 yards around left end. His 19-yard dash moved the Cardinal to the 3-yard line. \nMeanwhile, the Huskies were helpless on offense. Stanford sold out to stop the run on first and second down, putting UW in long-yardage situations. At that point, the Cardinal blitzed Carta-Samuels, who had no answers and inevitably threw incomplete. \nThe Huskies were 0 of 5 on third-down conversions in the first half and headed to the locker room with a mere 58 yards of offense. \nStanford added to its lead late in the half. After a drive stalled in the red zone, Conrad Ukropina made a 28-yard field goal to push the lead to 17-0. \nWashington added a bit of drama to the proceedings when it took the opening kickoff of the third quarter and carved up Stanford in five plays -- all of them runs by Myles Gaskin -- for a total of 57 yards and a touchdown. \nThe intrigue lasted three minutes -- the amount of time it took Stanford to respond with a touchdown of its own. It followed another fourth-down conversion (by Wright) and came on a 50-yard play-action pass from Hogan. After faking a handoff to Bryce Love, he hit McCaffrey down the right side to give Stanford a 24-7 lead.
