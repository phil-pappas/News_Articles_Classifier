But Klopp is a much better fit for the FSG model.\" \nFormer midfielder Danny Murphy, however, favours the experience of Ancelotti. \n\"Reading the CVs and what they have done and where they have done it and how many times they have done it, it is a no-brainer really,\" he told talkSPORT. \n\"You can't guarantee success with either guy because you are competing with Manchester City, United, Chelsea and Arsenal. \n\"Ancelotti has done it as a player, he has done it as a coach, and he has done it in different countries. He has done it here already with Chelsea. \n\"He has won the league here, he has won the [FA] Cup here, so he knows this league. That in itself gives him a head start on Klopp.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:49:59.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
