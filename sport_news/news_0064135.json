That mark was set in 2012 when the Union went 10-18-6 in their third MLS season.\nOn Sunday, the Red Bulls' Mike Grella scored the fastest goal in MLS history when he hit the back of the net just seven seconds into the game.\nMore coverage Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone!

Orlando (12-13-8, 44 points) needs a miracle to qualify. The top six teams in the Eastern Conference qualify and sixth-place New England has 47 points with one game remaining.\nOrlando needs to beat the Union and have New England lose at New York City FC. That is only the beginning. The first tiebreaker is wins and that would be even, so it comes down to the second tiebreaker - goal differential. New England has an eight-goal advantage.\nSo Orlando, led by sensational rookie forward Cyle Larin, will be a desperate team.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ml&ti=458194&pw=159355&ctc=worldcuparticle"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:46:09.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
