(AP) — Dalton Easton threw for 330 yards and four touchdowns — each to a different receiver — as Bryant upended Duquesne 38-17 on Saturday. \nThe Bulldogs (3-3, 1-1 Northeast Conference) grabbed a 10-0 lead after their first two possessions and led from start to finish as they broke a three-game losing streak. \nEaston capped an eight-play opening drive with a 3-yard touchdown toss to Chad Ward, and Bryant’s next drive ended with a 24-yard field goal from Ricky Perez. Just 25 seconds before the half, Easton fired a 14-yarder to Taylor Barthelette . In the second half, he found Jose Depadua for a 22-yard score and closed the game with a 26-yard throw to Hunter Taute after Duquesne failed to convert an onside kick. \nThe Dukes’ (4-3, 1-1) Sam Martello intercepted Easton and ran it back 42 yards. \nCoaches had predicted the teams would finish 1-2 in the Northeast.
