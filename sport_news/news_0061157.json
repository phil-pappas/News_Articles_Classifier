We tend to achieve more finesse, perfection, ethics, morality and honesty. On the contrary when we are alone, we may often be casual, callous and even dishonest at times.\nThe presence of a human being around us changes our attitude. But, we forget that there is someone over and above all mortals, that immortal supreme being, watching us all the time. When we change ourselves for the better in front of a human being for want of a better opinion, why can't we deliver our best to impress the ultimate authority who is the all-powerful judge ?\nThe author is a reader of dna\nHave a spiritual message?
