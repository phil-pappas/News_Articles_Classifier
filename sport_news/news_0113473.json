His dad, Frank Kmet, was a defensive lineman for Purdue after helping Hersey win the Class 6A state football championship in 1987.\nHe was a fourth-round pick of the Bills in 1992 but didn’t play in the NFL.\n“He’s going to Notre Dame, not many 16-year-olds get to say that,” Frank Kmet said of his son via email Friday morning.\nKmet’s commitment comes on the eve of one of the biggest games of the No. 6 Irish’s season at No. 12 Clemson.\nKmet, a 6-foot-5, 230-pounder, is rated a four-star prospect who also had offers from Baylor, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State and Tennessee among others. He joins tight end Brock Wright and offensive tackles Josh Lugg and Dillan Gibbons as commitments from the Class of 2017.\nThis season he has 18 catches for 214 yards and four scores for the 1-4 Lions.\npskrbina@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChiTribSkrbina\n Notre Dame Fighting Irish NFL", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560eccbc/turbine/ct-notre-dame-commit-cole-kmet-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:48:02.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
