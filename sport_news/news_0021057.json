A mountain biker, skier, alpinist and a celebrated chieftain of the outdoor tribe. And now, as the boss of the freshly minted Colorado Office of Outdoor Recreation Industry — the second position of its kind in the country — he's with the government and he's here to help.\nHis perch is paradoxical, but Benitez is making it work.\n\"The outdoor industry doesn't really need government. It's filled with passionate people who get it done without reliance on government help,\" he said. \"But we can help find connections and solutions, and hopefully the state can find some incentives to help grow this industry.\"\nHe has spent the first 90 days of his new gig touring the state, visiting with business owners, conservationists, athletes, advocates and industry groups, formulating a plan for how he can connect a notoriously independent industry with government assistance that will establish Colorado as the national capital of the outdoor industry.\nHe calls the past three months a listening tour. \"Our tribe is really a collection of stories.\"\nAdvertisement Benitez, 42, has galvanized the state's myriad, sometimes conflicting outdoor interests. This month, he announced an advisory board that includes the state's top players in nearly every aspect of outdoor recreation . Advocates for hunting and fishing, outdoor-gear design, motorized use, land conservation, nonprofits, education, ski resorts and wilderness are all at the table.\n\"He's bringing a voice to outdoor recreation, which sometimes has a hard time getting legitimized,\" said David Leinweber, the owner of Angler's Covey fishing shop in Colorado Springs and who is working with Benitez to unite recreation interests in the Pikes Peak region. \"We are too often not perceived as a business. We are seen as fun or play. But we are a major part of tourism.\"\nEconomic activity More than 90 percent of Coloradans participate in outdoor recreation every year. Most every visitor to the state joins in that outdoor play. Outdoor recreation stirs $34.5 billion in economic activity across the state, supporting 313,000 jobs, according to the 2014 Colorado Statewide Outdoor Recreation Plan .\nFrom his listening tour, Benitez identified four pillars of his office's focus: economic development; stewardship and conservation; industry anchors; and education.\nIt's a monumental quest for Benitez, the sole employee of the Office of Outdoor Recreation Industry who will soon move his home in Eagle to metro Denver with his wife, Katie. (He likes Morrison because, he said, \"I need to touch dirt once a day.\")\nHis mission is not just economic development, but protecting the vital playgrounds and landscapes that lure businesses to Colorado and keep them anchored.\n\"Even if you don't work in the outdoor industry, how important is it to be able to go hiking with your kids on the weekend or go bike your favorite trail? It doesn't matter what sector or what industry you work for, there is some component of the outdoor industry that touches your life in Colorado,\" he said.\nConservation, growth, economic and recreational development, stewardship and sustainability don't have to be conflicting notions, he said.\nHis summit is a long way off. Utah, which established its Office of Outdoor Recreation two years ago , has a good head start, as evidenced by the emergence of Ogden, Utah, as an outdoor recreation hub.\nBut Benitez, an accomplished mountaineer who first summited Mount Everest with blind athlete Erik Weihenmayer in a historic 2001 ascent , is no stranger to patient perseverance. As an expedition leader who has led climbers up the highest points on each continent, he has the trained focus to push a diverse group on a tight timeline and tighter budget toward a shared goal.\n\"Nothing is going to get done if you don't get off the couch. You have to be willing to get up, understand the adversity and embrace the risk,\" he said. \"That is what is unique about Colorado. I think people are willing to look at challenges in that light and really start to ask what's possible.\"\nHis ideas do break the mold.\nWhen his boss, Gov. John Hickenlooper, announced last month at Las Vegas' Interbike gathering a plan to spend $100 million on new bicycle and pedestrian trails — by redirecting existing federal and state funds, not new taxpayer money — Benitez huddled with bike and hike advocates. They needed more than a plan to build new trails. They needed a strategy for maintaining trails without relying, as trail advocates always do, on volunteers.\nThat conversation involves state and federal land stewards and thorny issues regarding access and permitting.\nHe talked to a guy in Kremmling who wants to open a mountain bike guide service. The wait on a Forest Service review of that bike proposal could stretch several years, but a film permit for a Subaru commercial on the same land takes a couple weeks.\nFinding efficiencies in an overburdened, cash-strapped federal land agency could come with a new sort of permit system, not unlike the licensing process for hunters, anglers and motorized users, he said.\n\"We need to think about a new way to have this pay-to-play conversation,\" he said.\nAccelerator spaces Another potential idea addresses the establishment of accelerator spaces for growing manufacturers. The state has done a good job of fostering new businesses with an array of incubators, but keeping employers in the state when they reach a certain size is becoming a critical issue.\nHe's talking with universities and aerospace businesses about using machinery that can be retooled at certain points in the year to allow an outdoor business to manufacture with new-school technologies such as 3-D printing, advanced molding and sonic welding.\nFrom his first day, he has labored to keep growing businesses from looking across the state border.\nOn a balmy Monday in August, Benitez was standing on the banks of the Yampa River outside Steamboat Springs, studying a dilapidated motel. Next to him was Bill Gamber, who employs 98 workers in several dispersed buildings that make up his Steamboat Springs empire of Big Agnes, BAP and Honey Stinger .\nGamber needs a new home — a campus, where all his workers can gather in one place. He wants to buy the shuttered motel the city bought a few years ago. The city is torn. It needs workforce housing, which a developer is proposing.\n\"What are your options if this doesn't happen?\" Benitez asked.\n\"We are losing our options,\" Gamber said.\n\"Is it Ogden?\" Benitez asked, noting that leaders from Ogden spend lots of days in Colorado, hunting for outdoor businesses that could move to Utah's expanding base of outdoor industry companies.\nCortez-based Osprey Packs recently moved 21 distribution jobs to Ogden. In August, Gamber had an employee go scout the new Osprey space. It was big and cheap.\n\"We don't want to throw that threat out there because we love Steamboat,\" Gamber said. \"But it forces us to, at some point, keep a small core of people here and send people somewhere else. It's pretty expensive for us to run our business here. Ogden is a great distribution center. So is Cheyenne.\"\nGamber's mention of those two out-of-state cities spurred Benitez to action.\nHe went to the Steamboat Springs City Council meeting that night, pleading with municipal leaders to support the outdoor industry and recognize the importance of Gamber's brands in Steamboat. He sent notes to city leaders on Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade letterhead supporting Gamber's plan.\nThe city is pursuing the workforce housing option, addressing a critical issue for Steamboat. But Benitez has other solutions for Gamber, whom he appointed to his advisory board. He's urging Gamber to take a look at places such as Grand Junction, Pueblo and Windsor for expanding his nearly 20-year-old businesses.\nYou don't have to move away from your beloved mountain towns when your business grows, Benitez said.\n\"The last thing I want to say is 'Hey, to have what you want, to scale like you want, you are going to have to give up your quality of life,' \" he said. \"That is BS. Who would ever do that? I'm telling everyone in Colorado you can have your cake and eat it too.\"\nThe rush to Ogden Benitez champions towns that have been overlooked in the outdoor industry rush to Ogden, which has lured almost 40 outdoor companies, including heavyweights such as Rossignol, Salomon, Atomic, Scott USA and Descente with tales of its railyard, proximity to the airport, new River Parkway trail system and nearby ski resorts.\nGrand Junction, he reminds, has a railroad through town, as does Pueblo. Both cities have a vibrant recreational scene.\n\"We really believe we can go toe-to-toe with Ogden,\" said Kristi Pollard, the head of the Grand Junction Economic Partnership, which has elevated outdoor recreation as a target industry for growing the Grand Valley's economy.\n\"We are the outdoor Mecca. We have the trails, the rivers, skiing at Powderhorn,\" Pollard said. \"We have a number of businesses already here. We have a great workforce, and the cost of doing business is reasonable here. We really feel like we are the full package. We are thrilled to be working with Luis to amplify our message.\"\nThe city of Pueblo is building warehouse space on spec, preparing for manufacturers to move south. The idea is to expand Pueblo's rich industrial manufacturing heritage to include outdoor business.\n\"We have manufacturing in our blood. So it's not hard to really pivot to any type of manufacturing,\" said Jeff Shaw, vice president of the Pueblo Economic Development Corp., noting the city's nearby reservoir, Arkansas River whitewater park and growing collection of bike trails as incentives for outdoor employers. \"It really fits into our community and our mission perfectly. Luis is just such a dynamic guy. We've had some fascinating conversations.\"\nHighlighting outdoor-business destinations comes down to focused messaging, Benitez said.\n\"That's what Ogden did and we didn't. But now that we are paying attention to it, I think we will skyrocket past what any other state has done up to this point,\" he said. \"We are trying to have a more focused conversation, and I think you will see a lot more significant short-term gains from that.\"\nThere is a sense of urgency.\nHickenlooper leaves office in January 2018. A new administration might not embrace an outdoor recreation office, even though Washington just formed the third-ever state outdoor recreation office and other states seem poised to follow.\nSo Benitez is aiming for both near- and long-term goals. On the close horizon, it's all about economic development, luring new businesses and keeping established outfits happy.\nBenitez said he soon will announce some big companies and organizations from the East and West coasts that will be relocating to Colorado .\nOn Thursday, the Colorado Economic Development Commission approved $556,346 in job-growth tax incentives for an unnamed East Coast outdoor recreation company that is considering moving its headquarters and 33 jobs to Denver.\nThe company told the commission that it began considering Colorado when Hickenlooper created the outdoor recreation office. But the company also said it's considering Utah as well, a reflection of Benitez's competition from the Beehive State.\n\"They are seeing the momentum that Colorado is creating both with this job and this office, but also announcements like the governor had around biking,\" Benitez said. \"When he made that announcement at Interbike, people started calling and saying, 'Hey, we'd like to talk about Colorado as our new home.' \"\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or @jasonblevins", "external_links": ["http://cpw.state.co.us/Documents/Trails/SCORP/SCORPOnlineReport.pdf", "http://www.deseretnews.com/article/590039800/Small-businesses-help-resort-town-weather-slump.html?pg=all"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:05:57.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
