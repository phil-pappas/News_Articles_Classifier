The #6 seed Mustangs will take on #2 seed Livonia next Saturday afternoon (Oct. 31) at Caledonia/Mumford High School. It will be the second straight year the Mustangs have made it to the semi-final game. Penn Yan scored a touchdown in every quarter to jump out to a 28-0 lead. Geneva scored late to avoid the shutout. Senior Quarterback Tanner Irwin tossed 4 touchdown passes in this game to pace the Mustang offense. Sean Emerson caught 2 TD passes, while Chris Rossi and Sam Voak pulled in one touchdown pass each. The Penn Yan defense was stifling in this contest, totally shutting down the normally potent Panther offense. It was a great team effort, both of offense and defense, by the Orange and Blue gridiron forces. The Mustangs improve their season record to 5-3 with the win.
