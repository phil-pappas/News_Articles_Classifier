I spoke to Sourav Ganguly and he is very upset that his name has been dragged in the matter. We will never accept anything against Sourav Ganguly,\" Tiwary said.\n\n\"Gautam Gambhir is not saying the truth. If I had done what Gambhir is saying why have I been fined 40 percent and him 70 percent,\" the Bengal cricketer added.\n\nGambhir and Tiwary had nearly came to blows on Day 3 of the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Bengal at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium here yesterday and umpire K Srikanth had to step in to defuse the situation.\n\nThe two players were summoned for a hearing after the day's play by Match Referee Valmick Buch.\n\nBuch has said that detailed report has gone to BCCI and they will now decide the quantum of punishment.\n\n\"I don't mind sledging but abusing someone's mother is not right,\" Tiwary said.\nThe incident happened in the eighth over yesterday when Partha Sarathi Bhattacharjee got out of Manan Sharma's bowling and Tiwary came in to bat at No.4 wearing a cap.\nTiwary first took guard and was about to take strike. But he stopped the bowler and signalled at the dressing room to bring his helmet as a pacer was operating from the other end.\n\nDelhi players felt that it was a deliberate time wasting tactic.\n\nManan ticked off Manoj and he told him to lay off. All of a sudden, Gambhir, at first slip, got into the action and started abusing the Bengal skipper, who then retaliated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:04:18.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
