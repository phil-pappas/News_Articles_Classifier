He scored his first goal from open play since last April over the weekend as Lyon beat Reims 1-0.\nAs host, France has automatically qualified for Euro 2016 and must rely on friendly matches to get ready for the tournament. The team hosts Armenia on Thursday before a trip to Denmark three days later.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
