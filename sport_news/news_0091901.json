Detroit fell to 1-6 with a 28-19 loss to Minnesota on Sunday. Matthew Stafford was sacked seven times. \nBlocking problems have plagued the Lions all season, limiting Stafford's effectiveness and the running game's productivity. \nQuarterbacks coach Jim Bob Cooter is taking over as offensive coordinator. \nDetroit plays in London next weekend against the Kansas City Chiefs. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:49:23.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
