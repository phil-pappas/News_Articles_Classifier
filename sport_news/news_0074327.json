We have to deal with it.\" \nOrange Lutheran's other standout sophomore, Hannes Daube , also played for the national team in Northern California but avoided the two-game suspension because he was yet to be declared eligible because of his transfer from Newport Harbor, Carrera said. Daube's sit-out period ended Monday and he will make his debut Thursday when the Lancers play host to Mater Dei at Santiago Canyon College at 4 p.m. \nCarrera said the CIF-SS indicated that Molthen needed to get approval to play to play for the U.S. national team. The section's bylaw 600 states that players become ineligible if they play for an outside team, in the same sport, during their season of sport. \nUSA Water Polo declined to comment Wednesday. The CIF-SS also declined comment, citing privacy laws. \nPlease send water polo news to Dan Albano at dalbano@ocregister.com More from Blog: OC Varsity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:01:09.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
