Vernon tennis wins first district title in 28 years By Rodger Wheeler stories@ky3.com The first district girl's tennis championship for the Mt. Vernon Lady Mountaineers since 1987 ended up being a nail-biter, something Lady Mt'neers head tennis coach Christine Maddocks was hoping against.\"I really hoped we would win all three doubles matches and that would take some pressure off our singles,\" said Maddocks after the win. \"It was a little touch-and-go there at the end.\" CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE MATCH The end she is referring to is the final two singles matches between Mt. Vernon's Abby Rinker and Makayla Simmons and Carl Junction's Ashley Houser and Taylor Niemeyer, respectively. All the Lady Mt'neers needed was one of those two to win and the Class 1 District 11 championship would be theirs. Rinker finished first, defeating Houser 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, and that gave Mt. Vernon a 5-3 win over the Lady Bulldogs. In doubles action to open the match against the two Big 8 conference schools, Mt. Vernon won two out of three. Winners included Rinker/Dannie Wilson over Houser/Sarah O'Hanahan 8-5 and Simmons/Alane Cordray 8-1 over Niemeyer/Hannah Hudson. Carl Junction's Chase Boyd and Annie Adrian defeated Mt. Vernon's Whitney Wiehe and Emily Reyelts 8-4. Three singles victories gave Mt. Vernon the title and a trip to the state sectional tournament Saturday, Oct. 10, at the home of the District 10 champion. Winners were Rinker over Houser, Wilson over O'Hanahan (6-0, 6-1) and Cordray over Hudson (6-2, 6-1). Carl Junction's Boyd defeated Wiehe 2-6, 2-6, while Adrian edged Reyelts 7-5, 6-4. Simmons of Mt. Vernon was leading Niemeyer when Rinker's clinching match ended the night's battle.\"It shows the true meaning of a team,\" Maddocks said. \"Our lower flights really came through for us today. This group likes to be together, cheer one another on and just be together. They are most definitely a team.\" The last time the Mt. Vernon girl's tennis program won a conference and district title, Maddocks, who was named this year's Big 8 Coach of the Year, was a member of that team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:05:58.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
