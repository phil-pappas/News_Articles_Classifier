With 1:06 remaining, Lundqvist somehow stopped Matt Read's backhander from in front. \nLundqvist made key saves in front to rob Scott Laughton with 6:22 left in regulation and Pierre-Edouard Bellemare with 3:30 to go. He also made two stops on a late Flyers power play. \nThe Flyers outshot the Rangers, 48-39, including 5-3 in overtime. \nThe Rangers' Jarret Stoll thought he had scored on a rebound with 8:15 remaining in the second period, apparently giving New York a 3-2 lead. The refs ruled no goal, and it was upheld after the Rangers challenged the on-ice call and the video was reviewed. \nThe NHL ruled Stoll made incidental contact with Mason before the puck crossed the goal line, preventing the goalie from making the save. \nEarlier, the Rangers had tied the score at 2 on Derick Brassard's power-play goal, scored when his point drive deflected off the right skate of the Flyers' Ryan White with 15:12 left in the second period. \nThe Flyers had taken a brief, 2-1 lead less than three minutes earlier thanks to Laughton's first goal of the season, a wrist shot from the left faceoff dot that went past goalie Henrik Lundqvist's lunging glove. \nA little over 11 minutes after 12-year-old cancer patient David Gibson dropped the ceremonial first puck on Hockey Fights Cancer night, defenseman Mark Streit scored on a point drive to give the Flyers a 1-0 lead. It marked the fifth time in their seven games that they had scored first. \nStreit finished off a nice passing play with Wayne Simmonds and Gagner, and Matt Read set a screen in front of Lundqvist. Streit's one-timer deflected off the Rangers' Viktor Stalberg. \n\"We had a great forecheck . . . and I just tried to get it on net,\" Streit said. \nJust 2:15 later, J.T. Miller got behind defenseman Brandon Manning and, from the doorstep, swatted a puck out of midair and past Mason, knotting the score at 1. \nBoth goalies made eye-opening saves later in the period. \nMidway through the period, Mason - who stopped Zuccarello on a two-on-one chance early in the game - did a complete spin-around and, at the last instant, got his stick on the puck just as it was about to cross the goal line, courtesy of Oscar Lindberg's deflection from out front. \nWith 2:23 to go in the first, Lundqvist denied Simmonds, who had come out of the penalty box and went in on a two-on-one with Giroux. Lundqvist got his right pad on the shot after the play started on Brassard's turnover. \nFlyers coach Dave Hakstol didn't view the matchup against the gifted Rangers as a way to gauge how far his team has developed. \n\"They're a quality opponent, but we're not looking for measuring sticks,\" the rookie coach said before the game. \". . . We have to worry about ourselves; we know we're playing a quality opponent, but we have to have the focus on the things we do and how we do them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:35:04.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
