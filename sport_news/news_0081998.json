I do not expect there to be further punishment just because he's been charged. Fresno State already lost two of its four scholarship quarterbacks to season-ending injuries. I would expect Greenlee and Kilton Anderson to both play Saturday.\nWhat's the morale of the team after combining the Zack Greenlee situation, the dismissal of linebacker Michael Lazarus on Tuesday and the losing streak the Bulldogs are experiencing? \nMW: I'm not in the locker room, but you've got to think morale is less than stellar considering the 1-4 start and quarterback mess. (I) Have not seen any outward signs of dissension or lack of effort. Still a little early for that.\nWhat do they need to do to start righting the ship on the field? \nMW: That's a tricky one because this team has so many weaknesses. More than anything they've been beaten in the trenches -- on both sides of the ball. There's no easy fix when you're getting physically manhandled up front.\nAre there any team strengths the squad will focus on to try to bring some success? \nMW: Tailback Marteze Waller is expected to play Saturday after leaving last week's loss to San Diego State with concussion symptoms. Even if he doesn't, Fresno State will try to establish some sort of running game. There's talent at receiver, if someone can get them the ball with more consistency.\nIs there anything in particular with the matchup against Utah State that players and coaches are talking about as points of emphasis? \nMW: Fresno State is expecting a physical game, especially from the Aggies' front seven, which doesn't bode well. The Bulldogs get good crowd support (by MW standards), but if Utah State builds an early lead while the offense continues to sputter, the environment won't be much of a factor.\nRyan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com .
