That's my goal,\" the world number three said.\n\"Everything else I just have to take the positives out of because I feel I've committed myself to being here and done everything possible.\n\"If I can stay healthy and work my way through the matches no matter who I'm playing, in this particular situation I have to worry about myself a little bit more than who I'm playing against.\"\nThe five-times grand slam tournament champion won the WTA Finals for her first and only time back in 2004 but she does not see herself as the player to beat when the tournament begins at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Sunday.\n\"That's not the way that I think. I don't think it would be fair to myself if I thought that way,\" she admitted. \"I'm one of the eight players. I did something to be in the field. I want to take my opportunity and that's how I see it from my side.\"\nGarbine Muguruza, Petra Kvitova, Angelique Kerber and Lucie Safarova are the quartet who make up the White Group.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:37:14.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
