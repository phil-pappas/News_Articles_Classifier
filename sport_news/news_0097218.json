Xi and Prince William also discussed Britain-China cooperation on football. \nSport has formed a recurring theme in Xi’s diplomacy. \nIn Ireland, he kicked a Gaelic football, while in the United States he accepted a jersey from David Beckham. \nThe Chinese national team’s poor performance in international football has long been a sore point with the Chinese public. \nThe country is ranked 81 st in the world, according to FIFA, the global football governing body. \nBut Xi’s affection for “the beautiful game” has moved it up the list of national priorities, with plans to expose more children to the sport. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:46:21.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
