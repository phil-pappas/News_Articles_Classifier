The Toronto Blue Jays yelled, hugged and jumped for joy around the mound after clinching their first AL East title in 22 years.\nTwo months earlier, such a celebration was almost impossible to imagine. Yet, with their 15-2 rout at Baltimore on Wednesday, the Blue Jays brought an appropriate conclusion to their unstoppable, late-season run.\nToronto entered the doubleheader needing only one victory to eliminate the Yankees and claim its first title since 1993. The suspense ended quickly as the Blue Jays built a 4-0 lead in the fourth inning before adding four unearned runs in the fifth.\n\"You're on the road, but it felt like a home game,\" said Marcus Stroman, who pitched eight innings. \"I thought the majority of the stadium was Blue Jays fans. So that just goes to show how excited people are to take the trip down from the North to see us clinch. It's been special.\"\nBecause there was a second game to be played, the Blue Jays opted to put off the champagne celebration until after the nightcap — which they lost after Baltimore's Chris Davis hit his 44th and 45th homers, 8-1.\nStroman (4-0) allowed one run and five hits with eight strikeouts in his fourth start since returning from left knee surgery.\nJose Bautista hit his 40th home run, Edwin Encarnacion delivered No. 37 and Justin Smoak also connected for Toronto. Ryan Goins had a career-high five hits to help the Blue Jays win their sixth straight.\nTroy Tulowitzki (back, shoulder) could return before the postseason, Toronto manager John Gibbons said.\nCARDINALS CLINCH: Jason Heyward's third-inning grand slam sparked St. Louis to an 11-1 victory over the Pirates to clinch the NL Central in Pittsburgh.\nThe Cardinals have won three straight division titles and 11 since 1994.\nFrancisco Cervelli hit his second career grand slam and Pittsburgh seized an 8-2 win in the opener.\nThe Cardinals' Adam Wainwright (Achilles) returned from a five-month stay on the DL and gave up one run in the eighth, his first appearance out of the bullpen since 2006.\nTWINS, INDIANS SPLIT (at Cleveland) — Jose Ramirez had four RBI, highlighted by a three-run homer, and Cody Anderson fired seven scoreless innings of two-hit ball as the Indians rolled in the nightcap, 10-2.\nIn the opener, Kyle Gibson pitched six shutout innings and Torii Hunter had a three-run double and Minnesota won, 7-1.\nA's 8, ANGELS 7 (at Anaheim, Calif.) — Los Angeles pinch hitter Collin Cowgill grounded out to end the game with the tying run on third. Mike Trout belted his 41st homer.\nRANGERS 6, TIGERS 2 (at Arlington, Texas) — Mike Napoli's two-run homer capped a four-run third inning for Texas.\nBRIEF: Mariners ace Felix Hernandez (18-9, 3.53) is done for the season, manager Lloyd McClendon said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:43:39.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
