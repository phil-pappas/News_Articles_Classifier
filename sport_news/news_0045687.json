Combine their success on returns with four SJSU turnovers, and the Tigers' average starting field position was their 47 yard line -- essentially midfield. \n\"It continues to be addressed,'' Caragher said. \"We haven't cleaned that up like I thought we would. I like the scheme. There's a point where the players have to shed the defenders and make tackles.'' \nSo bad was the kickoff coverage that it played a role in Caragher's decision to attempt an on-side kick with five minutes left and SJSU down by seven. \nOnce Auburn realized the on-side kick was coming, it called timeout to get proper personnel on the field. Despite losing the element of surprise, the Spartans went ahead with their plan. Advertisement \nAuburn recovered at the Spartans' 45 and scored the game-sealing touchdown two plays later. \n\"I don't have any qualms with it,'' Caragher said. \"We were playing to get the ball back to tie the game.\" \nLinebacker Christian Tago suffered what Caragher described as a stinger and is questionable this week, but there were no major injuries. \n\"Those games can have a devastating effect on the rest of the season, but we held up well,'' Caragher said. \nTailback Thomas Tucker, the primary backup to workhorse Tyler Ervin, will be \"down for a little while\" with an ankle injury suffered weeks ago, Caragher said. \nStarting quarterback Kenny Potter (ankle), who missed the past two games, continues to recover. Caragher declined to project whether Potter will play Saturday. \nThe Spartans' Oct. 17 Homecoming game against San Diego State will start at 7:30 and be televised by ESPNU.
