(Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) Jon Meoli Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Crockett Gillmore has a 'chance' to return as a weapon for Joe Flacco this week, John Harbaugh said. \nTight end Crockett Gillmore and defensive end Chris Canty, who suffered game-ending calf strains in back-to-back games in the first month of the season, both have a “chance” to play Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, coach John Harbaugh said. \n“They both have very similar calf strains,” Harbaugh said. “[Gillmore] missed the second half two weeks ago, was out for Pittsburgh. He has a chance for this week. We’ll see how it goes.” \nHarbaugh categorized Gillmore as “week-to-week,” and though Gillmore didn’t take an offensive snap against the Cincinnati Bengals in the second half, he was used some on special teams in the second half before missing all of last week. \nGillmore had three receptions for 40 yards in the first half against the Bengals and was on pace for another big day after his career performance in Week 2 against the Oakland Raiders. In that game, Gillmore had five catches for 88 yards and two touchdowns. \nIncluding the playoffs as a rookie last year, Gillmore had 17 catches for 151 yards and two touchdowns. He matched those yardage and touchdown totals on 10 catches through two-plus games this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:29:45.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
