AL DIAZ adiaz@miamiherald.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nThey’re back on track. \nThe Miami Hurricanes forced four turnovers, scored 10 points off two of them, and rode Brad Kaaya’s right arm Saturday to a 30-20 victory over Virginia Tech at Sun Life Stadium. \nKaaya threw for 296 yards and two huge touchdowns – both to Rashawn Scott near the end of each half. \nOutside linebacker Trent Harris recovered a fumble, cornerback Artie Burns had two interceptions – the last one with 2:29 remaining in the game – and linebacker Juwon Young had an interception to secure the victory. \nRunning back Joe Yearby scored a touchdown after Harris’ fumble recovery, and Michael Badgley added three field goals, including a career-long 49-yarder for the Hurricanes. \nAfter consecutive losses at Cincinnati and Florida State, the Canes got their first Atlantic Coast Conference win and first in the Coastal Division to raise their record to 4-2 and 1-1. \nVirginia Tech fell to 3-4 and 1-2. \nThe win was not without a loss. Starting middle linebacker and team captain Raphael Kirby left the game with an apparent knee injury, one that could be serious, in the third quarter. \nThe Hurricanes meet No. 5 Clemson next Saturday at Sun Life. The Atlantic Division Tigers, who haven’t been to Miami since 2009, was set to host Boston College on Saturday night. \nSusan Miller Degnan: 305-376-3366 , @smillerdegnan Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:23:00.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
