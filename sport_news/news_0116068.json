The consensus opinion is the offensive line has underperformed. Dallas' average gain per carry is ranked 15 th in the NFL and FootballOutsiders.com, with its advanced metrics, says the Cowboys are in the bottom half in the NFL in pass protection. But is that because former offensive line coach Bill Callahan is no longer there, the running back-by-committee setup hasn't worked according to plan or because defenses are stacking the box with the threats of Bryant and Romo removed?\nThat's not clear either.\nMany would claim the Cowboys' ground attack is weaker this year. Dallas has the 18 th -highest game average for rushing yards. But can that be attributed to DeMarco Murray's exit, the offensive line playing erratically or the quality of running backs used by the Cowboys in their rotation they continue to modify?\nIt's difficult to draw a definitive conclusion.\nThere are some who say the Cowboys' passing game has been betrayed by Linehan's lack of creativity and aggressiveness. Dallas has produced the fewest completions of 20 or more yards in the NFL. But is the lack of an explosive element in the Cowboys' offense the result of a void left by Bryant not being filled, shoddy quarterback play in wake of Romo's broken collarbone, or pass protection breakdowns forcing checkdowns underneath the coverage?\nThat's also not easy to answer.\nWhen there are problems like the ones the Cowboys are experiencing, the knee-jerk reaction is to do something radically different. Yet it's impossible to determine if the Cowboys' offense is fundamentally flawed or if it's just hindered at the moment without its two top talents -- Romo and Bryant. The running game may really be bankrupt and the offensive line depreciated. No one will know for sure until Romo and Bryant get back in the mix.\nWith so many variables introduced by the departure of Murray and the injuries to Romo and Bryant, all we know is what we don't know.
