Greg Walden, Oregon's sole Republican member of Congress, will head back to the Capitol next week in a moment of high-stakes policy and politics.\nWalden has offered himself as a fall-back candidate for speaker if Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan – the current favorite in the Republican caucus – decides not to seek the job.\nAt the same time, Walden this week revealed that he is abandoning his opposition to dam removal to support a wide-ranging plan for managing water in the Klamath Basin. He said he'll soon unveil legislation he hopes he can sell to key GOP members who have long been wary of ripping out dams.\nWalden, who chairs the House Republican campaign committee, said in a telephone interview Friday from Hood River that he's confident his party will maintain its strong House majority next year despite the the schisms that led House Speaker John Boehner to announce that he would leave Congress.\n\"Would I rather have us unified and marching in the same direction? Yeah,\" Walden said. But favorable district lines drawn after the 2010 census and numerous strong incumbents give Republicans a \"very strong built-in advantage right now,\" he argued.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was the favorite to replace Boehner. But McCarthy's doubts about whether he could win a clear governing majority led him to announce Oct. 8 that he would withdraw his candidacy.\nThe names of many potential candidates were floated in the wake of McCarthy's announcement, with Walden telling Capitol reporters he would consider serving as interim speaker while the caucus considered a permanent replacement.\nWalden said Friday that he wasn't out campaigning for the job.\n\"I said, 'Well, I have never turned down a tough job and, sure, if people wanted me to do that ... of course I'd do it. ... All of that is sort of water under the bridge because I'm still hopeful that Paul will do this and I would fully support him.\"\nRyan, who was Mitt Romney's running mate in the 2012 presidential election, has said all along that he prefers staying as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and is not so interested in being speaker.\n\"The problem with Paul is that he is a wonk, a policy wonk,\" said Walden. \"He enjoys his time deep in spread sheets and economic policy papers.\"\nIn contrast, the job of speaker is to \"manage big egos,\" said Walden, adding that Boehner has often said that his main job is \"managing member disappointment.\"\nWalden said he doesn't know what will happen if Ryan decides not to run. \"We're in uncharted territory\" if that happens, he said.\n\"But will we continue to pass bills and govern? Yes,\" Walden said. \"The sun will rise and we will continue. John Boehner will stay as speaker until we elect a new one.\"\nWalden's new legislative hope involves legislation ratifying a plan for managing water in the Klamath Basin, which straddles Oregon and California.\nA 2010 Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement aimed at resolving longstanding water conflicts among tribes, farmers, environmentalists and others still needs to be implemented by Congress.\nWalden has never fully embraced the agreement because it envisions the removal of four hydroelectric dams, which the conservation group American Rivers said would be the largest dam removal project in the world. PacifiCorp, which owns the dams, backs removing them, but many GOP lawmakers worry about the precedent it could set.\n\"I've never been an advocate of the dam removal,\" said Walden. \"I'm still not thrilled about it.\"\nWalden announced his change of mind Wednesday in Klamath Falls, where he told the Herald and News that he didn't see any alternative to keeping the entire agreement from blowing apart.\nIn his interview with The Oregonian/OregonLive, Walden said the \"clock is running on whether the parties will stay at the table.\" And he said the tribes \"hold the keys to the car\" because the courts have upheld their upper hand on water rights.\nWalden said he is working on legislation he plans to introduce soon to provide a path \"to save irrigated agriculture in the basin and provide water for fish and all the other things.\"\nWalden said he is not ready to discuss the details of his legislation, but he said he has been working closely with Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who is taking the lead on a Senate Klamath Basin bill.\nStill, getting anything passed in Congress remains difficult. As Walden signed off on the phone, he joked about the tumultuous week to come on Capitol Hill if Ryan decides to stay put as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.\n\"He may just come back Monday and say, 'Nope. Good luck. Have a nice life. I'm going to go look at the tax code.'\"\n-- Jeff Mapes\njmapes@oregonian.com\n503-221-8209\n@jeffmapes", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/08/majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-quits-speaker-race/73583652/", "http://www.heraldandnews.com/news/local_news/walden-to-push-basin-water-pact/article_b4560862-4e40-57d2-a5c9-8285278ea6ac.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:24:04.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
