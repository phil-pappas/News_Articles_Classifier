The Colts are not a good football team, and the Patriots (who are hyped to be worthy of an undefeated regular season) won by a seven-point margin. It could have been more.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The Colts exposed the Patriots secondary. A week earlier, the Cowboys exposed New England’s offensive line. It’s clear the 5-0 Patriots are excellent, but they’ve yet to be tested. There are players that need developing, positional groups that need improvement, and questions that need answering.\nHere are five things we still don’t know about the Patriots.\n1. Can the secondary shut down an excellent quarterback?\nImagine a scenario where Tony Romo and Dez Bryant were healthy for the Dallas Cowboys’ matchup against the Patriots in Week 4. Imagine if that version of the Cowboys passing offense had faced the Patriots secondary, while the Cowboys defense sacked Brady five times in the first half.\nIt’s not a pretty picture, is it?\nWithout Le’Veon Bell or Martavis Bryant, Ben Roethlisberger had 351 yards and a touchdown, as Antonio Brown burned the Patriots for 133 yards and a touchdown. Sure, they won, but it doesn’t take much imagination to realize it was a bad defensive outing for the Pats.\nIn Week 6, no Colts receiver surpassed 75 yards against the Patriots, and yet Andrew Luck passed for 312 yards and three touchdowns. Before Luck missed two games with a shoulder injury, he was averaging 251 yards, 1.7 touchdowns and 2.3 interceptions. Against the Patriots, Andrew Luck found a rhythm on the opening drive, spread the ball around, and lost by the closet margin in his career verses New England.\nThe solution to the problem involves improved play from five players: Malcolm Butler, Logan Ryan, Chandler Jones, Jabaal Sheard (who is injured), and Rob Ninkovich. It’s surprising when a Patriots pass-rusher a 2.5-sack performance, like Jones did against the Colts. It’s surprising when Malcolm Butler shuts down a No. 1 receiver.\n“Bend don’t break” be damned—those are bad standards for a defense that hopes to win a Super Bowl.\n2. Can Dominique Easley and Malcom Brown become every down players?\nThe Patriots have spent consecutive first-round picks on the same position. Belichick has never done that before, and it’s likely because the players have vastly different skills sets.\nEasley is agile and evasive with quick hands and feet—his fast jump off the line allows him to penetrate the backfield for sacks and tackles for loss. And he can dance.\nThat sack and dance by @DominiqueEasley though... pic.twitter.com/jqu31x1Z75\n— Twelve (@MisterPatriotic) October 20, 2015 Easley had an injury history, and fell to the Patriots in the draft, but (seemingly because of his injury history) had a slow rookie season and played only 24 percent of snaps . This season, he’s starting to be the disruptive force Belichick touted him to be.\nThe rookie, Brown, is a strong, pocket-pusher with the ability to shed blocks and consume gaps in the center of the line. Consistency, however, has not been either player’s strong-suit. Brown has gotten discarded by blockers in a few games. And Easley hasn’t provided consistent pressure in passing situations. As a result, the Patriots have gone by committee at defensive tackle, playing Sealver Siliga 141 snaps, Brown 115, Alan Branch 104, and Easley 88.\nEasley and Brown have the talent to transform an underwhelming position group into one of the most versatile defensive tackle tandems in the league. Perhaps it’s only a matter of time.\n3. Are the Jets legit? Can the Patriots beat them?\nJets Pro Bowler and 2013 first-round pick Sheldon Richardson is a backup, according to the team’s website .\nSo, yes, this team is legit.\nThe defensive lineman’s four-game suspension has something to do with his “backup” title. Still, the Jets also have 2011 first-round pick Mo Wilkerson and 2015 first-round pick Leonard Williams. They’re elite without Richardson.\nTheir roster looks like an AFC Pro Bowl roster but with outstanding chemistry and communication. The arrival of head coach Todd Bowles has done wonders for an already elite pass rush. And the revamped secondary is one of the NFL’s stingiest, with cornerbacks Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie.\nRunning back Chris Ivory is leading the NFL with 115 yards per game, and former Patriot Stevan Ridley could return from injury to provide additional depth in the already deep backfield.\nThe only question is at quarterback, which—as it turns out—is the most important position in football.\nRyan Fitzpatrick’s mobility has been his saving grace, and the quarterback has a knack for efficiently picking up first downs with his legs in a way that parallels Aaron Rodgers. Of course, he can’t throw like Rodgers. But wide receiver Brandon Marshall has been a monster—displaying power and finesse . Eric Decker has been a reliable redzone target, catching a touchdown in each of the games he’s been active.\nThe Jets could—and perhaps should —beat the Patriots at least once.\n4. Can the offensive line improve in pass protection?\nBrady has been mobile in the Patriots’ first five games.\nBrady? Mobile?\nIt’s not by design, and it’s not a Cam Newton impression. Because his offensive line is struggling, Brady is buying time in the pocket by stepping up and giving wide receivers a “second window” to get open, Belichick said in his weekly film breakdown .\nEven before injuries to Nate Solder and Marcus Cannon, the offensive tackles were consistently getting beat by defensive ends. Brady’s quick release has been partially a product of the Patriots’ quick passing attack, but it has also been a product of necessity. Despite his fast release, Brady has been sacked 13th-most in the NFL. And consider, too, the Patriots have played one fewer game than all but two of the teams with more sacks allowed ( the Vikings and Titans had also had byes ).\nThe awaited return of center Bryan Stork and guard Ryan Wendell may shore up the interior, but that hasn’t been their biggest problem. Solder is out for the year, and Volmer doesn’t look like he’s got the makings of a left tackle anymore. If healthy, Cannon will be tasked with Brady’s blindside—and it’s unclear if he’s capable.\nBrady may not need the extra time, but imagine what he could do with it.\n5. How does Brandon LaFell fit into the offense?\nLaFell figures to return as the Patriots’ third pass-catcher, behind Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman. He’ll be sharing time with Danny Amendola, who in Week 6 had his first 100-yard game since 2013. Scott Chandler and Keshawn Martin have been solid but unspectacular.\nWhile Edelman works underneath, LaFell will take control of the deep-middle of the field. During the 2015 season, LaFell was a reliable receiver with 74 receptions for 953 yards and seven touchdowns. He also caught a pair of touchdowns in the Patriots’ three playoff games. With so many options in the passing offense, his average of .4 touchdowns per game will fall. But he can still expect about 60 yards per game.\nHe’s a big-bodied, sure-handed target. Most important, Brady seems to like throwing to him.\nBelichick yourself before you wreck yourself\nPrevious -- of -- Next 10. Drew Bledsoe: It’s not Bledsoe’s fault that his injury cost him his job in 2001, but Belichick set a precedent for doing what was best for the team, regardless of prior history, when he kept Tom Brady in the starting lineup after Bledose returned. John Bohn/Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next 9. Wes Welker: Belichick benched Welker for the first series of a 2011 playoff game after his snarky comments to the media leading up to the game.

Eric Mangini: Belichick feuded with his former pupil Mangini, who left New England to become the Jets’ (and later the Browns’) head coach. Mangini ratted on the Patriots to ignite the Spygate scandal in 2007. Barry Chin/Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next 6. Fumblesome Running Backs: Laurence Maroney was benched in 2009 after a bad case of fumblitis. Stevan Ridley was relegated to the Belichick doghouse in 2013 with the same problem.

Adalius Thomas: Thomas was deactivated on two occasions during the 2010 season, a season in which his play struggled, his attitude soured, and he showed up late to a practice.

The Bucs went 2-14, and the Patriots won the Super Bowl. AP/Brian Blanco Previous -- of -- Next 2. Richard Seymour: The Patriots shocked the world by trading Seymour prior to the 2009 season, jettisoning a defensive cornerstone Belichick didn’t anticipate being able to re-sign after the season.
