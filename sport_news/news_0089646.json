The discovery was made near Dunkirk on France's northern coast. A three-year-old child was among the group. All but one of them were described as “safe and sound” despite the fact the temperature inside was “less than a degree”, they said. Most of the group said they were Syrian nationals but one was Vietnamese, the police said. The driver, a Spanish national, was apparently unaware of their presence, telling police he had pulled over when he heard “noise coming from his trailer”. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:12:40.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
