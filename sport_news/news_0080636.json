There was just too much of a body of work for Fuente, a former college quarterback and ex-TCU offensive coordinator, to dissect.\nBut sometime early this week, when Fuente has watched and re-watched the U of M's 37-24 victory Saturday over 13th-ranked Ole Miss at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, he might soften his stance.\nOn yet another big stage — this time against a ranked opponent on national television — Lynch delivered, much like he did a year ago directing a late two-minute drive to beat Temple that made the Tigers bowl-eligible for the first time in six years.\nOr like he did earlier this year in a 53-46 win against Cincinnati. Or like last December, when he willed the Tigers to an improbable overtime victory against BYU at the Miami Beach Bowl.\nSaturday's big numbers reflect what has become normal for Lynch. There were 39 completions, 53 attempts, three touchdowns. There were laser throws with pinpoint accuracy. Even his first interception of the season was a quality throw, one that bounced off his receiver before landing in the arms of Ole Miss' Mike Hilton.\nLynch, whose breakout season is attracting national attention and NFL scouts, had his fifth-straight multi-touchdown game of the season. And his three TD passes Saturday moved him past Martin Hankins into second place on the career list with 44.\nYet the throws he probably shouldn't have made were foremost on Fuente's postgame checklist.\n\"He definitely — on a couple of those across-the-field throws — said 'You know, you've made a couple of plays now' and then I finished (Fuente's) sentence with 'but don't be ignorant,' \" Lynch said. \"I knew what he was trying to say.\n\"I know that. You can't run around and throw the ball across the field. I know I had a couple of dangerous passes, but luckily they ended up in (our) receivers' hands.\"\nWhile Fuente found some aspects of Lynch's day to critique, he found more areas to praise. His quarterback has been impressive during a stretch of three straight nationally televised games.\n\"He was incredibly calm and composed,\" Fuente said. \"I talked to him at halftime and told him 'I don't want you to feel obligated every time you get out of the pocket to throw the ball back across the field. That's not really what you're supposed to do.'\n\"But if you are smart with it, you can occasionally make some plays doing that. He was judicious with the ball, tried to keep us in front of the chains and just, overall, had a very calm demeanor.\"\nIt is that calming influence Lynch wants to impart.\n\"Coaches always talk to me about how important it is for a quarterback to be a leader, especially how big I am. People are looking to me all the time. Even when I can't see them, they can see me.\n\"The biggest thing for me is to just be the positive guy when things aren't going well. And when things are going well, make sure everyone stays even-keeled.\"\nLynch and his receivers were particularly successful on third down, where the Tigers were 12 of 20, including multiple third-and-long opportunities. The U of M converted on third-and-16 from its 10-yard line in the second quarter (a 36-yard completion to Anthony Miller) and on third-and-13 from the Ole Miss 37 seconds before halftime (again Miller), a completion that extended the drive and led to a 6-yard TD pass to Miller for a 24-14 Tiger lead.\n\"Whenever an offense converts a big third-and-long against us, it breaks your heart,\" Lynch said. \"When you do it to another team, they are feeling the same thing. You have to huge those big gains as momentum starters.\"\nWith Lynch and the offense making those conversions — against a Rebel defense that lost potential All-America defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche in the first half to a concussion — the Tigers gradually escaped from an early 14-0 deficit to score 31 straight.\n\"We knew we could move the ball; we just had a couple of penalties against ourselves,\" Lynch said. \"We knew that once we stopped hurting ourselves we could move the ball.\n\"On those drives where we scored, we didn't have big drive-stopping penalties and we had a couple of receivers make plays and the running backs made plays as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:11:36.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
