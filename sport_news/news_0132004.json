It was Pat Hentgen and company shutting out the Brewers 2-0 en route to winning the second of back-to-back World Series. Every other clincher has been secured at home, north of the border.\nThe Jays found themselves on the horns of a champagne-swilling, cigar-smoking dilemma in the minutes following Wednesday’s victory. Given just a 30-minute turnaround prior to competing in Game 2, what are the proper rules of celebratory etiquette when only half the team can whoop it up while the scrubs and September call-ups prepare to play? The team’s decision was made to hold off until the end of Game 2 and then cut loose with the clubhouse spray-a-thon.\nBut that does not mean they did not celebrate the moment on the field just as the final out was made. At 7:25 p.m., umpire Kerwin Danley signaled a foul tip strike three on Jimmy Paredes and 158-games worth of emotion was released by the victors.\nThe Blue Jays vaulted over the dugout rail and charged 42-year-old reliever LaTroy Hawkins on the mound. Out of the bobbing pile of humanity that soon included relievers on the sprint came Russell Martin’s mask and several gloves. The coaches and staff stood respectfully in foul territory.\nWhen the pile started to unravel, Martin spotted the coaches on the sideline and waved them into the fray. Perhaps the happiest man on the field and usually its most guarded emotionally when it comes to public displays was general manager Alex Anthopoulos. He high-fived, low-fived, did Tie Domi goal celebrations and hugged every staff member and player down to the bat boy.\nWhen the last player had headed to the clubhouse to prepare for Game 2, the 500 Jays fans that had drifted down to celebrate began chants of “Al-ex, Al-ex, Al-ex.” He will never say how much that meant to him, but you know it did as he is a free agent in a month and has been oft-criticized in the past for being cheap and not spending enough money.\nThis is not the last laugh for Anthopoulos, but he can see it from here.\nThe Jays have secured home field for the ALDS and for the World Series. They need to tie the Kansas City Royals to gain the extra home game in the ALCS.\nThe Orioles approached Game 1 of the doubleheader like they thought they had ended their season five days earlier. Over the past five games, the O’s have scored five runs, three of them on one swing by Ryan Flaherty against the Jays’ Marco Estrada. Steve Pearce homered against Wednesday’s starter Marcus Stroman. The O’s were shut out three times by the Red Sox and have been outscored 36-5 in their five straight losses heading into the second game of the doubleheader. The Jays played well enough to win anyway, even if the O’s had been trying, but met with little resistance from the home side.\nFor the Blue Jays, this has been an unusual run to the playoffs in terms of belated celebrations. On Friday night they beat the Rays and, elsewhere, the Twins lost to the Tigers. The Jays believed when they left the ballpark late that night that they needed to wait for the result of the Angels game to know if they had clinched a post-season spot. The Angels won, but since the AL West’s Rangers, Astros and Angels were playing each other intra-division all through the final week, it turned out the Jays had already clinched, mathematically. Even then, they waited until they won on Saturday to celebrate.\nAfter Tuesday’s rainout, the Jays awoke Wednesday morning with a magic number of one, because the Yankees had lost to the Red Sox Tuesday night. Just as it had been with the wild-card clinch that resulted in a delayed celebration, so it was with the AL East.\nBut in this case, the Jays showed it’s always better late than never.\nMore on thestar.com\nA lookback at the other 5 Blue Jays AL East titles", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:39:40.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
