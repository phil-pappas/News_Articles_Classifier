(AP) - As part of the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the office of top federal prosecutor in South Dakota is sponsoring a one-day event to raise awareness about the rights of people with disabilities. \nThe office of Acting U.S. Attorney Randolph Seiler says the conference is meant to educate the public about its role in protecting those rights. \nThe event is scheduled for Oct. 21 at the Sioux Falls Convention Center. The agenda is geared toward health care professionals, law enforcement officials, educators, tribal leaders and government officials. \nThe speakers will include Boston Marathon bombing survivor Heather Abbott and state Sen. Billie Sutton, who will talk about his journey in learning to live with a disability as a result of a rodeo injury in 2007. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:31:47.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
