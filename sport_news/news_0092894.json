Alabama overwhelmed the 15-point underdogs from there. \nQuarterback Jake Coker moved Alabama downfield thanks to athletic catches by ArDarius Stewart and Calvin Ridley. Then he turned it over to Henry. \nDobbs and Tennessee managed a first down before the sacks. Anderson jarred the ball loose and A'Shawn Robinson recovered on the second one. \nAlabama has won the last nine meetings, and the Vols have dropped 24 straight against Top 10 teams. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:24:28.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
