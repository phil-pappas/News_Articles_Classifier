They have the top two Belgian defenders in Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld. \n\"With the draw of the group with Monaco and Spurs, we are very close to the Champions League level.\" \nAnderlecht will know plenty about Thursday's opponents as Mauricio Pochettino's squad boasts four Belgium internationals, although the Spurs boss may rest a number of his key men with one eye on Sunday's Premier League trip to Bournemouth. \nThe Argentinian has not rotated his side to the extent he did in this competition last season and, no matter what team he puts out, counterpart Besnik Hasi knows they will pose a threat to his Anderlecht side. \n\"Whatever they put out there, 50/50 from the starting team and the bench, they are still a very big team,\" the Albanian said. \n\"Europe is different from the domestic league. We always play high and offensive as possible - in Europe we take less risks but try and win the game. \n\"Spurs are a very strong team with a lot of power in central areas and the defenders come very high and they are very dangerous in the last quarter of the pitch. They have quick players and we will need to be careful with our organisation.\" \nDefeat could leave Anderlecht five points off the top two in Group J with three games remaining and Hasi is under no illusion that his side need a result against their Premier League visitors. \nAsked if the game against Spurs was there last chance to get out of the group, he replied: \"No, but it is a very important game. The loss we had in Baku against Qarabag hurt us. \n\"It is still possible and tomorrow we will probably have to win to have a chance because more of our games are away and that is more difficult.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:20:11.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
