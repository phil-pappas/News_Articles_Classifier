He should have been released on August 21.\"\nEarlier this week Pistorius's family accused officials of bowing to \"political and media hype\" after the star's release was again delayed.\nIn a trial that made headlines around the world, Pistorius was jailed last year for killing his girlfriend, model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine's Day 2013.\nHe was found guilty of culpable homicide -- a charge equivalent to manslaughter -- after saying he shot Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door because he mistook her for an intruder.\nEven if he is released, Pistorius faces a further test on November 3 when prosecutors appeal to South Africa's supreme court for a murder conviction and a harsher sentence.\nA champion Paralympian and once a poster boy for sport, Pistorius, known as the \"Blade Runner\" for the prosthetic legs he wore on the track, rose to global fame when he raced against able-bodied competitors in the 2012 London Olympics.\nReeva Steenkamp's parents, who are convinced Pistorius murdered their daughter in a rage, have strongly opposed the athlete's possible parole.\nThe latest parole review on Monday ordered him to undergo further psychotherapy treatment and recommended he must be put under firearm restrictions if allowed out.\nThe trial revealed the world-famous athlete to have a volatile personality and a penchant for guns.\nHe was accused of firing a gun through the sunroof of an ex-girlfriend's moving car in 2011 and, weeks before he shot Steenkamp, he accidentally discharged a gun at a Johannesburg restaurant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:32:02.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
