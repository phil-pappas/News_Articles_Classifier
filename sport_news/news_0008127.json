He opened the scoring by hitting Shondel Connerton on a 13-yard pass. Then, with a 14-0 lead in the second, Nehring connected with Conner Cross on an 11-yard touchdown. \nCole Visser ran into the end zone from the 3 for the Tigers’ third touchdown and a 21-7 lead at intermission. \nNehring plowed in from the 1 with less that two minutes remaining in the third for a 21-point lead. Connerton added a 19-yard rushing touchdown with four minutes left, but the Bulldogs made a late charge. \nTwo running touchdowns in about one minute gave Broadwater hope, but Manhattan hung on. \nBELGRADE 55, BROWNING 26: The Panthers won their second game of the year in dominant fashion to move to 2-5 overall. No further scoring information was reported, and head coach Eric Kinnaman did not return a phone call before press time. \nBelgrade will host one-win Park next week in its regular-season finale. \nLONE PEAK 74, ALBERTON 12: Bridger Babcock scored five touchdowns in the first quarter to lead a 54-point opening-frame outburst. The Rams added 20 more points in the second before easing up. \nBabcock scored on runs of 38, 12, 14, 34 and 39 yards. Eddie Starz added two rushing scores from 21 and 5 yards out. Starz also passed to Devin Quinn for touchdowns of 28 and 16 and Chase Samuels also hauled in a 10-yard score. \nAfter giving up a 78-yard kick return touchdown and a 27-yard passing touchdown in the first, Lone Peak’s defense shut down the Panthers for the final three quarters. \nCORVALLIS 61, PARK 6: The Blue Devils tallied 42 points by halftime en route to a blowout. Park’s Rydell Floyd hit Dalton Walker for a 10-yard score in the fourth quarter to breakup the shutout. \nCorvallis’ Wyatt Haldorson ran for five touchdowns, including a 95-yard score. He also found the end zone on runs of 5, 3, 49 and 20. \nThe Blue Devils earned their first win of the year, while Park was denied its second straight victory at home after beating Browning last week. \nMichael Appelgate can be reached at mappelgate@dailychronicle.com or 582-2670.
