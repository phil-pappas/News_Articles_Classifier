All Arizona has done so far is outscore its opponents by a combined 100 points thanks in part to a rejuvenated Carson Palmer and Larry Fitzgerald and a playmaking defense that has forced 13 turnovers. These trends could pan out well this week against a Steelers squad (still without Ben Roethlisberger) that is off a short week following a last-second win at San Diego on Monday night.\nBengals (-3) over BILLS: The Bengals have proved to be pretty resilient so far in their 5-0 start, including a come-from-behind win a week ago against Seattle (trailed 24-7 in the fourth quarter). Buffalo has alternated wins with losses. While the Bills do have the home-field edge, keep in mind that injuries to some key members of their offense (Tyrod Taylor, Sammy Watkins, LeSean McCoy and Karlos Williams) has seen them in a downward spiral following a 209 total yard performance a week ago.\nLast week: 2-0, Season: 8-2\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide ,  steele trap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:56:18.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
