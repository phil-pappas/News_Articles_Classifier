That duo combined for a key 25-yard reception on the next Warriors drive that led to a score, and host McClymonds eventually won 36-6. \n\"I knew what I had to do. I jumped really high, I got back on my feet and I tried to get that touchdown and got it,\" said the 5-foot-7 Garrett about his touchdown catch. \nPurvis finished with four completions in eight attempts for 93 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe junior also rushed for 36 yards and two touchdowns, a 4-yard run in the second quarter and a 22-yard run in the third quarter. \n\"We put some passing stuff in. We know every week we've got to get better,\" McClymonds coach Michael Peters said. \"Our kids play with a lot of energy and don't give up.\" \nThe Warriors (6-0, 1-0 Oakland Athletic League) were limited to 48 yards of offense in the first quarter by the Knights (3-3, 0-1). But the 53-yard pass play from Purvis to Garrett really jump-started McClymonds' offense. It gained 122 yards in the second quarter, taking a 21-0 lead. Advertisement \nDefensively, McClymonds was solid throughout the game. It limited the Knights to 4 total yards in the first half and 24 total yards after three quarters before Castlemont started moving the ball. The Knights scored on a 75-yard fourth-quarter pass from Darren Mailangi to Toderick Gellington. It was the first time that the Castlemont squad scored against McClymonds since 2009. \nThe Warriors, who stretched their winning streak over Oakland Athletic League teams to 36 games, took a three-touchdown lead in the second quarter on a 15-yard pass from Purvis to Jerrell Alberty. He also finished with a game-high 54 yards rushing. \nMcClymonds' final touchdown in the fourth quarter was scored in spectacular fashion. Donald White intercepted a Joe Feao pass 1 yard into the Castlemont end zone and returned it the length of the field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:09:27.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
