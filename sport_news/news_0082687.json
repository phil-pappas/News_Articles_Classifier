Washington is also without forward Nicklas Backstrom, its second-leading scorer from last season, who has a hip injury. \nJones has now allowed just one goal in his first three starts and owns a shutout streak of 178 minutes and 11 seconds. Jones allowed a goal in the first two minutes of last Wednesday's season opening win over the Los Angeles Kings, but has since made 77 straight saves.

The Sharks also killed five minor penalties Tuesday, and have killed off 12 straight to start the season. \nThe Sharks took advantage of one of their three power plays in the first period, as Thornton redirected a shot from the point by Brent Burns past Capitals goalie Braden Holtby for a 1-0 San Jose lead with 9:06 left in the first. \nThe Sharks had a 17-8 edge in shots in the first with a decided territorial advantage, but the Capitals had their chances. Jones stopped a shot from Jason Chimera after a Thornton giveaway from the Sharks' corner. Advertisement \nBrown's goal came after linemate Tierney drove to the net to get a shot on Holtby. Brown followed up the play and scored for the first time since Dec. 3, 2013 to give the Sharks a 2-0 lead. \nSan Jose took a 3-0 lead with 12:35 left to go in the third. After Tommy Wingels' shot was stopped by Holtby, Hertl collected the rebound and scored his second of the season. \nThe Capitals appeared to cut San Jose's lead to two after Dmitry Orlov's slap shot from between the circles found the uppercorner of the net past Jones. \nBut Sharks coach Pete DeBoer challenged the goal, and it was ruled that Jay Beagle had interfered with Jones just before the puck went in, and San Jose kept its three-goal lead. \nWashington had a golden opportunity to score midway through the third period on the power play. Evgeny Kuznetsov deked Jones from in close and had an open net in front of him, but couldn't put it away with his backhand.
