After defeating Charlotte two weeks ago, they have their first chance at a winning streak this weekend.\n\"Every game is a big game,\" defensive coordinator Roc Bellantoni said. \"I know that is a clich√© but it's the truth. But every game can be a momentum-builder.\"\nThe Owls felt a bye week was the perfect remedy for their early-season struggles. It gave them chance to regain health after being hit with a rash of injuries during an 0-3 start. Quarterback Jaquez Johnson and running back Jay Warren, who both missed time due to injury, were the biggest beneficiaries of the week off.\n\"I think it came at a perfect time,\" Bellantoni said. \"We really needed it as a team.\"\nTechnology assist\nThe Owls are part of a recent trend of teams using technology to improve practice methods. The iPad has made it easier for players to break down the previous practice before arriving the next day.\nIt allows to the coaching staff cover more ground during a typical week of preparation.\n\"They have watched the previous day's practice before we meet in the morning,\" Bellantoni said. \"It's kind of nice. We can cover other things about the opponent.\"\nNext game: FAU vs. Rice, 2:30 p.m., Saturday, Fox College Sports\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n Florida Atlantic Owls Conference USA Marshall Thundering Herd Rice Owls", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616c4e9/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:30:55.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
