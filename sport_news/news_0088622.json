Soon after, he was sent away from the only team he had ever known.\nAs a free agent last winter, Lester was back in control, and upon meeting with Cubs president Theo Epstein, Lester let his former general manager know his main priority.\n“We spent a lot of time talking about 2016 and beyond and what we would look like and how we thought at that time we thought we’d be consistent contenders and he kept bringing the conversation back to 2015,” Epstein said Friday at Citi Field. “He said, ‘Hey, I’ve just been through a season in Boston when we tried to break in a lot of young players and it got me in last place and got me traded.’ He said, ‘I’m not looking to go through that again. What can you tell me about why this will be different?’ ”\nDespite coming off a last-place season and more than a century without a championship, Epstein convinced Lester the Cubs could be immediate contenders, signing him to a six-year, $155 million contact.\nAnd now, Lester will start Game 1 of the NLCS against the Mets at Citi Field, thanks to Epstein’s familiar “arrogance.”\n“I think the biggest thing that sold me, especially on not only these young guys, but the whole organization was just how arrogant he was about it — and I mean that in a good way,” Lester said. “He was very confident in what he has done to this point to get this team to the next step and I thought that was the most impressive part.”\nMost impressive about Lester’s 10-year career has been his performance in the playoffs.\nIn 15 postseason appearances, Lester has compiled a 2.66 ERA, nearly a run better (3.55) than the three-time All-Star’s regular-season career average.\nIn two starts against the Mets this season, Lester was superb, going 1-0 with a 2.08 ERA, though both outings came before the trade deadline. Still, Lester has owned the biggest difference in the Mets’ lineup since those games, holding Yoenis Cespedes — who Lester was traded for last summer — to a .154 career average (2-for-13).\nThe lefty’s success, and the Cubs’ perfect record against the Mets this season, make Lester believe Chicago has the advantage entering the series opener.\n“It does add that confidence. You know you’ve beaten this team,” Lester said. “Here, I think it adds maybe a little bit of comfort.”\nSoon, it could be like it was for him and his former teammates in Boston.\n“I mean, it’s got to end sometime, right?” Lester said of the Cubs’ title drought that has dragged on since 1908. “To go back to ’04, those guys are legends in Boston. … Dave Roberts stole one base, and this guy hasn’t paid for a meal or drink since. I mean, it’s fun to think about, but we’ve got some games to go before we get there.\n“We’ve got to worry about [Saturday], worry about the Mets. And if we get into that position, obviously, it’s going to be a pretty special time for the city of Chicago.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  jon lester ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  theo epstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:38:06.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
