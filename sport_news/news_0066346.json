We’ve had to find solutions to injuries and it’s been really pleasing.\n“We have shown signs of a really interesting season. This is now a very important period for us. Arsenal is not a fixture historically we do well in.”\n 23, 2015 8:48 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:09:20.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
