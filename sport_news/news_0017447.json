(DON PEAT/Toronto Sun) Report an error KANSAS CITY - \nThe mayor of Kansas City has issued a mouth-watering challenge to Toronto counterpart John Tory ahead of tonight's opening game of the American League Championship Series between the Royals and the Blue Jays. \nSly James said he will wager a selection of ribs and barbecue sauce from three Kansas City restaurants on the outcome of the series and is now waiting for Tory to offer something in return. \n\"I'm looking forward to hearing from you, mayor, we want to hear what you guys are going to put up. Make it something good, brother.\" \nJames also boldly predicted a Kansas City victory in the best-of-7 series and that he wouldn't lose the bet. \n\"I wouldn't start getting your knives and forks out, however, because we plan to win this thing,\" he said at an outdoor news conference Thursday surrounded by Royals' fans. \nJames didn't offer any suggestions on what Tory should bet, but noted there is one thing Kansas City doesn't need from his Canadian counterpart. \n\"I will warn you in advance we have our own maple syrup, so something else maybe.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:52:28.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
