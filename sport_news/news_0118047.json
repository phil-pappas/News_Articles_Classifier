It was 4 a.m. and foggy. In that moment, the idea for the asylum was hatched.\n\"Dolls are perfect,\" Williams said. \"Because they're cheap. And they creep people out.\"\n\"All of these are donated or bought from Goodwill or other thrift shops,\" he said.\nAll, that is, but the first seventy-five. Those were left to Loutzenhiser when her mother died.\nThrough the years people who've toured the house have discreetly placed dolls in the displays, adding to the collection.\n\"And they come and see them every year,\" Williams said.\n-- Beth Nakamura 503-221-8218\nTwitter: @bethnakamura\nInstagram: @bethnakamura\nThe Doll Asylum is free and open to the public.
