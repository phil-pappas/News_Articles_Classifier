On the second night of a five-game swing through the Western Hockey League’s U.S. Division, the Wheat Kings (8-1-0-2) overcame a 2-1 deficit midway through the second, scoring twice in the last seven minutes of the second period and twice more in the final five minutes of the third period to improve to 5-0 on the road this season. \nWheat Kings head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon was happy with his team. \n\"I liked our game tonight,\" McCrimmon said. \"I thought we played well. We withstood a few challenges with the penalties that we took in the second. … There were a lot of good things for our team on the road tonight.\" \nThe Wheat Kings took an early lead when 16-year-old Stelio Mattheos scored his second of the year, a lead erased just over two minutes later by Tri-City’s Tyler Sandhu. \nThe Americans took a 2-1 lead on a four-on-four goal by Parker Bowles. It came midway through the second during a stretch in which the Wheat Kings took four penalties in seven minutes. \nBut a John Quenneville short-handed goal and Rihards Bukarts’ power-play marker put Brandon up 3-2 before the period ended. \nTri-City tied the game 12:21 into the third on a goal by Juuso Valimaki off a nice feed from Strathclair’s Morgan Geekie, but it didn’t last long. \nBukarts scored his second of the game two minutes later and Jayce Hawryluk managed to score a bad-angle empty-netter to seal the win with 25 seconds left. \nMattheos said it was a solid victory for the Wheat Kings. \n\"It was a pretty big battle out there,\" Mattheos said. \"We rallied late and got the win. It was a good win for us on the road.\" \nMcCrimmon was pleased with the offensive contributions from throughout the lineup, with nine different players hitting on the scoresheet. \nAfter a 4-3 shootout victory over the Spokane Chiefs on Wednesday and Friday’s win in Kennewick, the Wheat Kings have twice been confronted by teams that make it difficult to get shots to the net. \n\"That’s been the case through two nights,\" McCrimmon said. \"They play a little bit of a different style than the teams in the East but that could change as we go along.\" \nThe Wheat Kings next see action on Sunday against the Portland Winterhawks (3-6-0-0), who sit last in the U.S. Division. \nICINGS: Brandon scratched a pair of new additions to the team’s sick bay, F Reid Duke (lower body) and F Linden McCorrister (upper body), along with two forwards who didn’t make the West Coast trip, Tim McGauley and Ty Lewis (upper-body injuries, out week-to-week) Both Duke and McCorrister are day to day and could skate on Sunday … D Mark Matsuba played forward for the Wheat Kings on Friday, a role he was also asked to fill last spring in the playoffs. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:29:32.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
