Still, assistant coach Lou Decicco (r.), Chijioke Ezenyilimba (below) and the team work to improve. Chijioke Ezenyilimba likes to talk big. The two-way lineman from Cardozo didn't just beat opponents last season, he \"tortured\" them.\nBut since he and his teammates moved up to the varsity level this season, Ezenyilimba has had to tone down the rhetoric. In its inaugural varsity effort, the PSAL Cup division opener on Sept. 10, Cardozo absorbed a 35-0 whupping by Petrides.\nNevin Williams , a junior tight end/linebacker, described the loss as \"heartbreaking.\"\nIt was also rare.\nCardozo, traditionally one of the top sports schools in Queens, had gone 1-0 as a developmental team, in 2010, and finished 8-0 competing as a JV squad last fall, routinely blowing out teams by more than 30 points.\nThe Judges came into the Sept. 10 game overconfident and shorthanded, with 14 players unable to play because they hadn't satisfied the league requirement of practicing 15 times.\n\"Everybody was shocked,\" Ezenyilimba said. \"Because when they hear 35-0, they usually think that's us (winning).\"\n\"We can't get worse,\" added running back Fabian Bramwell . \"It can only get better.\"\nIt did. The Judges had more success on Saturday, leading by six at the half before losing at home, 22-12, to InfoTech.\nBryan Pace for News Cardozo, competing as a varsity team in the PSAL for the first time, loses its first two games. Still, assistant coach Lou Decicco (r.), Chijioke Ezenyilimba (below) and the team work to improve. Bramwell rushed for 94 yards and a touchdown while quarterback Perry Haskowitz completed 11 of 18 passes for 168 yards. The Judges (0-2) have a date with Franklin K. Lane (1-1) on Saturday at noon.\n\"We lost the game but it was very competitive,\" said coach Joe Kaso . \"We played well and we just have to keep improving. We're still experiencing some of the growing pains (of having a young program.)\"\nCardozo is making progress off the field, as well. The school is looking to promote the team in the area, at middle schools, youth leagues and parent association meetings, to attract future players, Cardozo athletic director Joe Cavallo said.\nThe school's first-ever homecoming game is scheduled for Nov. 6 against Far Rockaway . A pep rally two days earlier, with alumni and cheerleaders, is also in the works, \"just to tap into the football culture,\" Cavallo said.\n\"You look at it as an investment,\" he said of having football. \"It's just another added aspect to make students want to come here.\"\nPetrides coach David Olah predicts the Judges will have a good team sooner rather than later, given the school's resources and commitment to athletics.\nIf nothing else, the players are learning a lesson in humility after the Week 1 loss.\n\"We tend to not stay humble, especially after winning so many times,\" Ezenyilimba said of last season's success. \"So now, at least we've become humble.\"\nmabramson@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:09:36.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
