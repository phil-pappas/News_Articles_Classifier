(AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo) Sponsored Links The Associated Press MEXICO CITY — \nForward Giovani Dos Santos will miss Mexico's playoff game at the United States on Saturday, a match that determines which nation will represent its region at the 2017 Confederations Cup. \nMexican interim head coach Ricardo Ferretti made the announcement Monday, a few hours after Dos Santos was included in El Tri's 23-man roster. Dos Santo has three goals in seven league matches with the Los Angeles Galaxy this season. \n\"Gio has an injury, and he(asterisk)s not going to be able to play with us,\" Ferretti said during a news conference. \"We(asterisk)re still figuring out who is going to take his place in the roster.\" \nMexico captain Andres Guardado and defender Rafael Marquez were included in the roster. \nGuardado, who scored six goals to lead Mexico to victory in this year's CONCACAF Gold Cup, injured his left ankle in PSV Eindhoven's 2-1 Champions League win over Manchester United on Sept. 15. Expected to miss the playoff game, he started Sunday in the Eredivisie against Ajax. \n\"He(asterisk)s going to be here as usual with the same attitude and commitment,\" Ferretti said. \nMarquez was substituted after straining a groin during Hellas Verona's 1-1 draw with Atalanta in Italy's Serie A on Sept. 20. \nTo have them back for the game, Mexico sent their physiotherapist Carlos Pecanha to Europe to work with both players. \n\"He has recovered well, and we are waiting for his arrival to see for ourselves how he(asterisk)s doing,\" Ferretti said. \"If he(asterisk)s good, he will remain in the final roster.\" \nGiovani(asterisk)s brother Jonathan was selected after being left off for last month's exhibition draws against Trinidad and Tobago, and Argentina. \nThe playoff will be played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Mexico plants to travel to Los Angeles on Thursday. \nFerretti took over Mexico after Miguel Herrera was fired for allegedly punching a TV reporter in an airport in Philladelphia, one day after Mexico(asterisk)s win in the Gold Cup. \nThe roster: \nGoalkeepers: Moises Munoz (America), Jonathan Orozco (Monterrey), Alfredo Talavera (Toluca) \nDefenders: Paul Aguilar (America), Hector Herrera (Porto, Portugal), Miguel Layun (Porto, Portugal), Rafael Marquez (Hellas Verona, Italy), Hector Moreno (PSV Eindhoven, Netherlands), Diego Reyes (Real Sociedad, Spain), Arturo Rivas (Tigres), Jorge Torres Nilo (Tigres) \nMidfielders: Javier Aquino (Tigres), Jonathan Dos Santos (Villarreal, Spain), Andres Guardado (PSV Eindhoven, Netherlands), Israel Jimenez (Tigres), Jose Juan Vazquez (Leon) \nForwards: Jesus Corona (Porto, Portugal), Giovani Dos Santos (Los Angeles, MLS), Carlos Esquivel (Toluca), Javier Hernandez (Bayer Leverkusen, Germany), Raul Jimenez (Benfica, Portugal), Oribe Peralta (America, Carlos Vela (Real Sociedad, Spain) Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:27:42.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
