On Wednesday night, that meant something bad for the Bruins, who blew a two-goal lead in the third period and lost to the Flyers, 5-4, in their first appearance in the NHL’s new 3-on-3 overtime format. The game-winner, which prevented the Bruins from winning their first home game (they’re 0-3-1 at TD Garden), actually came during a 4-on-3 Flyers power play, when Claude Giroux scored while Ryan Spooner served a hooking penalty. Based on the possibility that Patrice Bergeron, whose wife was giving birth to the couple’s first child, and Matt Beleskey (upper body injury) would miss the game, Bruins coach Claude Julien formed four new lines in the morning skate. Bergeron’s availability allowed Julien to reunite the third and fourth lines that had helped the B’s win two straight on the road (Chris Kelly-Spooner-Jimmy Hayes; Zac Rinaldo-Joonas Kemppainen-Tyler Randell), but more juggling was necessary after Rinaldo was ejected at the end of the first period after taking a major penalty for charging. A back-and-forth game swung after Rinaldo’s penalty went into effect at the start of the second period. The Bruins, who couldn’t use elite penalty-killer Zdeno Chara (he was penalized for slashing at the first-period siren) for the first 3:32, not only survived the five-minute 4-on-5, they snapped a 2-2 when Kelly scored the Bruins’ second shorthanded goal in as many games at 4:31. Another swing came about four minutes later. Tuukka Rask, who’d had a streaky first period (13 saves), stopped Wayne Simmonds’ shot on a 2-on-1 break, and Jimmy Hayes then rushed up ice with David Krejci’s pass and beat relief goalie Steve Mason along the ice at 8:49 to put the Bruins up 4-2. The Bruins, whose first period had often been their best through the first five games, were relatively fortunate to escape Wednesday’s in a 2-2 tie. That was primarily due to a couple of lapses by Rask, whose failure to cleanly glove Pierre-Edouard Bellemare’s floater left a rebound for the Flyer forward to swat home at 9:28, and he let the visitors go ahead 2-1 at 15:04. This time, a shot from the left circle by Sam Gagner beat him to the short side. The B’s matched both goals, and Bergeron was part of the answer each time. Brett Connolly, skating with Bergeron and Brad Marchand in place of Loui Eriksson (Beleskey’s replacement with David Krejci and David Pastrnak), scored his first goal in 10 games as a Bruin at 13:28, popping Bergeron’s rebound past Flyers starter Michal Neuvirth, who brought a shutout streak of 132 minutes, 5 seconds into the game. Page 2 of 2 - That made it 1-1. The Bruins’ league-leading power play cashed in on its first chance of the night, with Bergeron scoring his fourth goal of the season — all of them during power plays. Eriksson’s whack at Krejci’s goal-line feed was stopped by Neuvirth and popped in the air, and Bergeron whacked it home before Neuvirth could snare it. Another swing was to come, though. At 6:34 of the third period, Pastrnak couldn’t get a weak-side opportunity past Mason after Colin Miller’s perfect pass, a goal that would have made it 5-2. Instead, Claude Giroux scored at 7:48, and Simmonds tied it at 10:24.
