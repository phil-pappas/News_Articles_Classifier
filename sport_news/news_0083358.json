Williamson was able to drive away, but lost her eye.\n\"They were out together in the middle of the night to commit crimes, and this is the result of it, a poor innocent woman gets shot in the face when she's on her way home from work,\" said Blackwood.\nYouth judge rules shooter needs mental evaluation\nA court hearing was also held Monday, October 19, at Strickland Youth Center, where the alleged shooter's defense attorney asked the judge to grant the juvenile an updated mental evaluation, even though the D.A.'s office said the teen has already had a couple mental evaluations in the past.\nAccording to Blackwood, the 15-year-old alleged shooter will get the mental evaluation before a youth judge will determine whether or not he should be charged as an adult in the case of the attempted carjacking.\n\"They are looking for the mental capacity at the time of the defense, and the ability to stand trial,\" said Blackwood about the mental evaluation.\nThe alleged shooter will face a Strickland judge again in November, after the mental evaluation has been completed, for the judge to decide whether or not he should be prosecuted as an adult.\nOther juvenile \"gang members\" facing charges\nMeanwhile, two other juveniles involved in the crime were granted youth status at Monday's hearing, which means those two will be prosecuted at Strickland Youth Center, and will not be charged as adults.\nAn official with the D.A.'s office told FOX10 News those two teens are 14 and 15-years-old.\nOf the eight teens allegedly involved in the crime, four 15-year-old boys and one 14-year-old will be prosecuted in the juvenile system, according to Blackwood.\nHowever, law enforcement is still looking for a 13-year-old, who officials said was also involved in the attempted carjacking.\n\"If he were with his parents or in school, we would know where he is, but right now we do not know where he is,\" said Blackwood about the 13-year-old still at large.\nWhen that juvenile is taken into custody, he will also face the same charges as the others charged: attempted murder, first degree robbery and shooting into an occupied vehicle.\nOnly one alleged gang member to face adult charges, so far\nCurrently, only one teen faces adult prosecution. Isaiah Kelly, 16, has also been charged with attempted murder, first degree robbery, and shooting into an occupied vehicle.\nIn a \"perp walk\" at Mobile Police Headquarters, reporters asked why he was in handcuffs, to which Kelly responded, \"I was there.\"\nOfficials said the reason Kelly has been charged as an adult is because if a child commits a crime with a weapon at the age of 16, they bypass the juvenile system entirely and are treated as an adult.\nWarrants issued for the arrest of witnesses\nAccording to Blackwood, the D.A.'s office has issued warrants for the arrest of some witnesses in the case, who failed to show up after being served subpoenas for their testimony.\nBlackwood said the witnesses did not see the crime first-hand, but are \"witnesses in another capacity.\"\nAll content Â© 2015, WALA; Mobile, AL.
