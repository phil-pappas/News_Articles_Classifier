And after many series of hunting and pecking, the Bears had found a few things to disrupt the rhythm of the best defense on the FCS level. \nThen, the trap door opened. \nComing out of a quarter change with the ball at the UCA 46, coach Steve Campbell decided on a bootleg play for how the McNeese defense was stacking against the run. \nThen, the coaches spotted the McNeese players lining up for a blitz on the same side the bootleg was called. They checked to another play toward the other side. \nBut there was confusion that bothered Campbell seconds before the snap. \n“The ball was snapped early and it hit our guy (Jatavious Wilson) on the leg and they got the scoop-and-score,” Campbell said. \nYou remember those Mario video games? After the 46-yard touchdown return of the deflection, the entire McNeese team seemed to have been charged with a super power cell. The energy from the Cowboys might have lit a bank of lights in Estes Stadium. A defense that didn’t need much of a jolt took things to another level, directly resulting in too more touchdowns. \n“It was one of those deals,” Campbell said. “That’s coaching. That’s on me.” \nAlthough timeouts were precious in the back-and-forth struggle, Campbell, in hindsight, would have called timeout. \n“Different things happen in games that as a coach you file back for next time,” he said. “I don’t blame Jatavious or Hayden (Hildebrand, the quarterback) or Alec (Willis, the snapper). It’s our job as coaches to make sure that doesn’t happen.” \nCampbell admits he got a little greedy with a play call against one of the best defenses in the country. “I thought we would be able to maybe stick a fork in them,” he said. \nMistakes magnify against McNeese. \nCampbell describes it like swimming with sharks. \nMcNeese State, a team used to winning and winning big, knows how to react when they sense blood in the water. \nAnd in the short history of the UCA-McNeese rivalry, there has seemed to be at least one weird, unexplainable play (either by the Bears or the Cowboys) that has played a major role in deciding the game. \nThe good news for UCA is the defeat is not a devastating one although the Cowboys (6-0, 5-0) have an inside track to the conference title. \nIn this week’s FCS top 25, five teams are 3-3, six others are 4-2 and Northern Iowa is 2-4. With that trend, there will be a bunch of 8-3 and 7-4 teams at season’s end. \nIf the Bears win out and finish 8-3 and 8-1 in the Southland, they should definitely be in. A finish of 7-4 and 5-2 still puts them in good shape. \n“What you do with a defeat like that is learn from it,” Campbell said. “It’s learning experience for all of us.” \nThe Bears’ remaining games (at Lamar and Nicholls and at home against Southeastern Louisiana, Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston State) are all winnable. They could also lose to any of them. \nIt’s a tightrope walk. \nAnd those lessons learned — even as something as simple as a single play call on second and nine — can provide the balance. \n(Sports columnist David McCollum can be reached at 501-505-1235 or david.mccollum@thecabin.net )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:26:39.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
