And if Eddie Royal (ankle) plays, the receiving corps would almost be back to full strength. The Bears must decide whether Charles Leno or Jermon Bushrod is their best left tackle against defensive end Ziggy Ansah, who's tied for the NFL lead with five sacks. He's powerful with a high motor. Quarterback Jay Cutler believes the Lions are disguising coverages better than last season.\nON THE GROUND\nNFL ranks: Bears offense 16th, Lions defense 27th\nThe Lions will be without defensive tackle Haloti Ngata because of a calf injury, a critical loss because of his size, power and ability to occupy linemen. His absence should enable Bears linemen to climb to the second level more easily. Rookie center Hroniss Grasu has a better feel for the speed of the game in his second start. Running back Matt Forte entered Week 6 leading the NFL in rushing yards and carries. His agility and vision behind the line of scrimmage has helped cover for blocking breakdowns.\nBears 27th in total offense, 28th in points scored\nLions 22nd in total defense, 26th in points allowed\nBears on defense\nIN THE AIR\nNFL ranks: Lions offense 9th, Bears defense 3rd\nQuarterback Matthew Stafford was benched last Sunday and leads the NFL with eight interceptions. He has battled questions all week about his inconsistent play, his relationship with coach Jim Caldwell and his future. Defenses have consistently pressured Stafford into mistakes, and he also has made his share by holding the ball too long. The Bears probably will mix their matchups and techniques against receiver Calvin Johnson. Rookie safety Adrian Amos is mindful of the deep threat Johnson poses and will prioritize keeping plays in front of him.\nON THE GROUND\nLions offense 32nd, Bears defense 24th\nShifty running back Joique Bell (ankle) is expected back from a two-game absence, but that won't necessarily jump-start a rushing attack averaging only 49 yards per game. Rookie Ameer Abdullah fumbled twice last Sunday and has three this season. Defensive lineman Will Sutton (left elbow, biceps) is expected back from a two-game absence. His quickness and ability to penetrate flashed early in the season. Inside linebacker Jonathan Anderson could make his NFL debut in place of Shea McClellin (left knee).\nLions 26th in total offense, 30th in points scored\nBears 4th in total defense, 28th in points allowed\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Detroit Lions NFL Matthew Stafford Calvin Johnson Joique Bell Ezekiel Ansah", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56233f49/turbine/ct-matchups-bears-preview-spt-1018-20151018"], "published": "2015-10-18T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:40:29.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
