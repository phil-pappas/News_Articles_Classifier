Royals' fans got oh-so-close last season when K.C. lost to the San Francisco Giants in the World Series in seven games. \nToronto won the 1993 World Series on one of the most famous home runs in baseball history. It was the second of back-to-back titles for the Blue Jays, but they haven't been back to the Fall Classic since. No matter who makes it to the World Series, it should be fun to watch. \nGame 1 of the ALCS between the Royals and Blue Jays is Friday at 7:30 p.m. \nThe Mets and Cubs start the NLCS Saturday night at 8:07 p.m. \nWhich two teams do you want to see in the 2015 World Series? \nWhat do you think would be the best matchup? \nVote in the poll then drop below in the comments section to give us your World Series prediction. \nContact Brent Axe: Email | Twitter \nListen to \"On the Block\" weekdays from 5-6 p.m. on ESPN Radio Syracuse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:54:38.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
