Be it the construction of roads, installation of paver blocks, laying of sewerage and water supply lines or sanitation in the city, the UT Administration has now empowered theSDMs to conduct regular quality check. The decision was taken after receiving a number of complaints about poor quality of work being carried out by various departments of the MC. The aim behind the decision was to ensure quality work for city residents. Confirming the development, UT Adviser Vijay Kumar Dev said under the new system, there will be a double check on the quality of work being carried out by the MC. The SDMs had been empowered to check the quality of work of all departments such as roads, public health, sanitation and enforcement. The Administration and the MC were committed to providing quality services to city residents, he said. Sources said under the new system, the SDMs could take samples of material from sites where work regarding construction of roads, installation of paver blocks and PCC tiles and laying of water and sewerage pipelines was being carried outby the MC. Councillors had opposed the move when the UT Administration had assigned the ex officio charge of the Additional Commissioner, MC, to the SDMs in the last week of August. According to the orders of UT Administrator Kaptan Singh Solanki, the Administration had assigned the ex officio charge of the Additional Commissioner to the SDMs for their respective divisions. The SDMs were assigned the job of looking after field activities of the MC, including sanitation, solid waste, water supply, enforcement and the engineering department, in their respective subdivisions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:19:24.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
