Previous Next Enlarge Immaculata High School Athletics Director Tom Gambino said the referees must have not seen the player get hit with the helmet.\n“Obviously this is very serious,” Gambino told mycentraljersey.com. “When you see it on film, it’s like ‘oh my God.’ Obviously the officials didn’t see it. If he did, I’m sure he would have walked the kid to the Linden sideline. These are good guys (officials). That’s not the point here. It’s hard to believe they didn’t see it. But, come on. If you see that, you have to think that he would have been led off the field.”\nGambino did say he received an apology from Linden school officials but is still “waiting for answers” before determining whether or not to pursue charges.\nON MOBILE?
