There’s no panic. We’ve got a veteran core group that knows how to handle stuff like this.\" \nStill, the Rangers have scored just one goal in back-to-back losses to the Canadiens and Jets. Their power play – and Vigneault tinkered with both of those units as well – is 1-for-14 this season. \nAnd though they started the season with three straight wins, honestly, how much stock can now be put in their home-and-home sweep of the Blue Jackets, who entered Saturday’s game against the Blackhawks winless amid rumors ex-Rangers coach John Tortorella would soon replace Todd Richards. \n\"We’ve got quite a couple guys right now who, results-wise, offensively and defensively, can be quite better,\" said Vigneault, whose blunt assessment of Thursday’s 3-0 loss at Montreal had been, \"We got schooled.\" \n\"Sometimes it grabs their attention a little bit, excites them to have the opportunity to play with someone else,\" Vigneault added. \nSo Derek Stepan, not Derick Brassard, is now centering Mats Zuccarello and Rick Nash, who has started the season without a goal in his first five games for the first time in his career. Brassard is now between Chris Kreider and Jesper Fast, a fourth-liner in three games and a healthy scratch in the other two. \nHayes will center J.T. Miller and rookie Oscar Lindberg instead of skating on Stepan’s wing. And Viktor Stalberg was shifted to Dominic Moore’s fourth line with Jarret Stoll, unless Tanner Glass plays and makes Stalberg a healthy scratch for the first time. \nDefensively, longtime top-pair partners Ryan McDonagh and Dan Girardi have been split up because of their struggles. McDonagh will start with Kevin Klein while Girardi will be paired with Keith Yandle. \n\"We need more from everybody,\" McDonagh said. \"You’ve just got to feel confident with anybody you’re paired with. It’s up to the players to get in sync.\" \n\"It’s still early in the year,\" Hayes added. \"[Vigneault] is trying to find lines he likes.\" \nBRIEF: Henrik Lundqvist will make his sixth straight start. Vigneault would not name his starter for Monday night against the Sharks, though Antti Raanta is expected to make his Rangers’ debut. \nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:15:09.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
