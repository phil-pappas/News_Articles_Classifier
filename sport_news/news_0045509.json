This new facility is great. My teammates are great. We're all getting along and chemistry is good. The coaching staff is really helping me and I've gotten even better just being here. Even though it's my fifth year, I feel like I've gotten better. So I'm just ready for the season to start. \nQ: Why UMass? \nAS: A combination of reasons. Coach (Derek) Kellogg's a great coach, and coach Shy (Chatman) is a great coach. Trey Davis, of course, is one of my best friends. The history, honestly, I was a big fan of Chaz Williams. I used to watch him a lot. I just wanted new scenery. It's a tough conference and I'm ready for the challenge. \nQ: The Trey relationship is one that's probably caught fans' eyes. How long have you guys known each other and what's that relationship like? \nAS: We've known each other since about sixth grade. So a long time ... Actually, it started off with me being in his ear. When I thought about making that transition, I talked to him and asked him if that would be good move. He said yeah, it'd be a great move. I always like playing with him. (I thought) for our last year together, we should make some history. \nQ: How are you fitting in with the team? \nAS: Really good, really good. I'm not really surprised, I'm a sociable guy. But the guys took me in, welcomed me with open arms and showed me the ways. Same with the coaches. I'm really excited and blessed to be here. \nQ: Where do they have you playing out on the court? \nAS: The 4, 5, 3. Whatever or wherever I can fit in. I'm not really worried about what position they have me in as long as I'm on the court and can contribute. I think we're going to have a pretty good season and I'm ready to be a part of it. \nBONUS QUESTION: Do you have any \"Spaceman\" nicknames or anything like that? \nAS: Naw, no, just call me Space. Just Space, just Space. It's fine, but I just go by Space. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:21:19.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
