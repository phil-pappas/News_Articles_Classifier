LOUIS — St. Louis' sports commission and professional ice hockey team are pushing for the city to host the 2018 International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship. \nCity representatives will make their final pitch to host the event as they court USA Hockey committee members this week. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports ( http://bit.ly/1W2VCur ) that Pittsburgh and Buffalo, New York, are the other final cities under consideration. \n\"It's pretty exciting to think about,\" said Frank Viverito, president of the sports commission. \"This would be one of our very biggest events. You look at all we've done, with all the NCAA championships and postseason things, but this is way up there.\" \nTen countries participate in the World Juniors, a 31-game tournament that takes place over two and a half weeks. Six games would be played at the Family Arena in St. Charles in addition to Scottrade Center downtown. A regional junior tournament also would be conducted in association with the event. \nSt. Louis has not hosted a Stanley Cup Final in 45 years and it has never held an Olympic hockey championship. For hockey enthusiasts, the International Ice Hockey Federation event could be the next best thing. \nThe event would come to St. Louis during late December and early January — a time when the city is in need of an economic boost. Attendance for the 2015 championships hosted in Montreal and Toronto boasted 365,000. \nSome of the larger events the sports commission has held in St. Louis have generated estimates of $10 million to $12 million. Viverito suggested the World Junior Championships could bring in double that amount. \n\"I think, more than anything, it helps grow the sport of hockey here, and it makes me happy to see how much the Blues care about that, how passionate they are in pursuing this for the city,\" Viverito said. \nThe federation moves the championship around to a different country each year. The United States has hosted the event in cities such as Minneapolis, Boston and Buffalo, New York, in the past. \nThe host city is expected to be announced in early December. \nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:14:39.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
