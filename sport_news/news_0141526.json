Myers' second chance also went wide right. Then in overtime, his 48-yard attempt went wide left.\nHasselbeck took advantage of the field position to drive for the winning score.\nVinatieri became the first NFL player to reach 1,000 points with two different teams.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
