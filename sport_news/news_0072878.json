Second half proved that we figured things out at halftime. I took charge, was the best leader I could be, and it turned out alright.\" \nTom Wilwert/Central Elkader Head Coach \"We were able to stay close enough that the second half, when the defense started to figure it out, we were still in the game in good position.\" Can't Find Something? 500 Fourth St. Waterloo, IA 50703 News: (319) 291-1200", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:44:39.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
