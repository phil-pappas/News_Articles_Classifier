Left winger J.T. Miller added two assists for the Rangers.\nThe Blackhawks received goals from left wingers Artemi Panarin and Teuvo Teravainen. The loss spoiled a festive night for Chicago, which celebrated its title before the game while the Cubs celebrated an NL wild-card win in Pittsburgh.\nRangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist stopped 32 of 34 shots to improve to 6-1-2 against the Blackhawks.\nChicago goaltender Corey Crawford turned aside 24 of 27 shots.\nThe Blackhawks thought they tied the scores with one minute remaining when right winger Patrick Kane dislodged the puck from beneath Lundqvist's pads. However, officials ruled that Lundqvist had frozen the puck.\nThe Rangers opened the scoring 1:43 into the first period on Lindberg's first career NHL goal. Miller slipped a pass to Lindberg, who ripped a one-timer from the right of the crease.\nPanarin answered with his first career NHL goal to even the score at 1 with 5:36 to go in the first period. Kane found Panarin alone in the slot to set up the goal.\nA one-timer by Klein made it 2-1 with 3:22 remaining in the opening period.\nThe Rangers increased their lead to 3-1 when Stepan punched in a goal with 59 seconds remaining in the first period. Right winger Kevin Hayes missed wide on a breakaway opportunity, but he retrieved the puck and flipped a pass to Stepan before Crawford could recover.\nChicago cut the deficit to 3-2 on a one-timer by Teravainen with 13:05 left in the second period. Teravainen beat Lundqvist glove-side after taking a pass from right winger Marian Hossa.\n(Editing by Julian Linden )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:14:10.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
