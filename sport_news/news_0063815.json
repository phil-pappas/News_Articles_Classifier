When Ezekiel Elliott did it Saturday at Indiana, the Buckeyes nearly lost more than that. \nThey nearly lost the longest winning streak in America, the longest regular season Big Ten winning streak, a decades-long stranglehold over the Hoosiers and the longest road winning streak in the nation. \nOne thing they did lose in the wildly exciting and exasperating 34-27 victory was faith in their quarterback. \nOhio State coach Urban Meyer said afterwards he never considered pulling Cardale Jones during another erratic performance, but his words said one thing and his actions something completely different. \nAfter the Hoosiers closed within the final margin with 10 minutes still to play, the Buckeyes took possession of the ball twice and went into survival mode: run-run-kick, run-run-flip pass (essentially a run)-kick. Playing not to lose against a team without its starting quarterback and the nation's leading rusher, both hobbled by ankle injuries. \nNo thought was given to letting Jones throw a pass with the Buckeyes backed up in their own territory. \nSome contend Meyer wanted to run the clock, which I'm sure he did, but I don't think that's the reason he handcuffed Jones. If it was, I missed when he changed into a sweater vest. That's not Urban's way. He wants to put his foot on your throat. \nExcuse the double negative, but this was a head coach not trusting his quarterback not to make a mistake. And could you blame him? Jones missed on two touchdown passes on the same first-half series, continually showed indecision in the pocket (taking 20 yards in losses) and threw an interception to set up a go-ahead touchdown after the Buckeyes had taken their first lead in the third quarter. \nJones doesn't look comfortable on the field and his body language isn't any better on the sidelines. The saving grace is that the OSU offense finally rediscovered its sometimes forgotten identity (hey there, Zeke) because it had no other choice. \nElliott was ridiculous during the 2014 postseason but he took ridiculous to a different level in the second half Saturday with touchdown runs of 55, 65 and 75 yards to match shoeless Keith Byars' monster game in a 1984 shootout with Illinois. Only 1995 Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George had more yards (314) in a single game in OSU history. \nThe Buckeyes would need every last inch from Elliott to win a game that would come down to batting away a pass in the end zone on the final play. By comparison, escaping from Bloomington the last time (2012) with a 52-49 victory was like breaking out of the Mayberry jail. \nOhio State brought many of its problems on itself. Jones had plenty of company in the blame department, from players to coaches. \nJalin Marshall fumbled twice, Braxton Miller negated a TD with an illegal block, the defense let an attack featuring backups at quarterback and tailback generate 17 second half points, and ultra conservative play-calling at the outset played right into the hands of the fired-up Hoosiers, who were off to their first 4-0 start in 25 years. \nThe Buckeyes lost the turnover battle (3-0) for the fourth time in five games and are minus-four for the season â€” minus eight if you throw out the 4-0 edge they had against Hawaii, a game that was only 17-0 midway through the fourth quarter. \nThat's a recipe for disaster and so is playing scared. \nAfter Jones underthrew a handful of deep balls the previous week against Western Michigan, it didn't seem to be coincidence that a vertical attack was mostly missing from the gameplan Saturday. Almost curling up into a fetal position at the end of the game sent an even stronger message. \nSo why is Jones, whose biggest and maybe only asset is a strong arm, even playing? Why is Meyer so wedded to Jones when he has a 2014 Heisman finalist as another option? \nMeyer says the turnovers have to stop \"right now\" but continues to back the quarterback who has been more turnover-prone. Jones has already thrown five interceptions. J.T. Barrett threw 10 all last season when he was setting 19 school or Big Ten records before getting hurt. \nIn 29 years of covering Ohio State, I've never been more perplexed by a coaching move (or non-move) pertaining to the quarterback position. This coming from a guy who saw Bobby Hoying, who would be All-Big Ten, forced to share time with Bret Powers, Steve Bellisari chosen over any other QB on the roster, and Rose Bowl hero and eventual Big Ten MVP Joe Germaine playing second fiddle to Stan Jackson. \n\"The script (Saturday),\" Meyer said, \"was written a little bit like (the) Penn State (game) last year.\" \nThat would be a more comforting thought if the quarterback who took over that game in overtime (Barrett) was getting his job back this week. \njspencer@nncogannett.com \n419-521-7239 \nTwitter, Instagram: @jspencermnj \nOhio State quarterback Cardale Jones had another shaky performance vs. Indiana, but apparently his job is safe.
