The appeal is due to be heard on Nov. 3.\nKnown as \"Blade Runner\" because of his carbon-fibre prosthetics, Pistorius became one of the biggest names in world athletics at the London 2012 Olympics when he reached the semi-finals of the 400m race against able-bodied athletes.\n(Writing by Ed Stoddard ; Editing by James Macharia)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:09:27.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
