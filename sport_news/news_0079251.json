It had reached the Vikings 34 with 17 seconds left before quarterback Seth Peters was intercepted in the end zone, allowing Berry to run out the clock. \nIn the standings the loss pushed the Warriors behind the Maroons, this week’s opponent. \nThis is Hendrix and Chicago are matching up for the first time since the Warriors’ football program was re-established in 2013 and it looks to be a tough matchup. \nHendrix is traveling up to the original Big Ten member’s house where Chicago will honor former running back and 1935 Heisman Trophy winner Jay Berwanger. This honor marks the 80th year since Berwanger won the first Heisman and it is also homecoming for the Maroons. \nThe Warriors will face two of the conference’s most prolific offensive players in quarterback Burke Moser and running back Chandler Carroll. \nOn the season, Moser is second in passing yards per game, at 249.7 and tied with Peters in passing touchdowns, throwing 15. \nCarroll trails Hendrix running back Dayton Winn in rushing yards per game, running for 133.8 yards per game and rushing touchdowns, running for eight. \n“We have to stop the run and force [Chicago] to pass,” Buchanan said. “We can’t let Carroll get cutback lanes and keep him to a minimum.” \nBuchanan said Chicago probably views Peters and Winn like Hendrix views Moser and Carroll. \nHowever, the Warrior defense has stepped up in a big way over the last three games, allowing 320 or fewer yards in three consecutive games and four times overall on the season. \n“The defense has gained confidence each week and they have continued to build on that,” Buchanan said. “We have tackled better and have elevated how we play each week. The defense has given us opportunities to win each week and we have to capitalize on that.” \nHendrix defense has given up 31.2 points per game on the season, while Chicago’s defense has given up 22 points per game. \nHowever, the Maroons have one of the worst defenses in the conference at stopping the run, allowing 190.3 rushing yards per game. \nWinn has ran for 1,016 yards on the season, which is second at the Division III level and has ran for 13 touchdowns. \nWinn is 39 yards shy of his single season career-high in rushing yards he set last year with four regular-season games left. \nBuchanan said he thinks all the running backs on the team are capable of this because of the offensive line’s work, but Winn is the engine of the offense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:04:36.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
