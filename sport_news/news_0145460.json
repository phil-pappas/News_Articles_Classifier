Beltre had a cortisone shot.\n“Obviously we want Adrian in there,” Banister said. “He’s the heart and soul of this ballclub.”\nAfter going for tests at a hospital, Beltre returned to the clubhouse about an hour after the game and walked gingerly. An MRI confirmed Beltre had a strained back but no structural damage, GM Jon Daniels said.\n“We haven’t ruled him out of tomorrow’s game,” Daniels said.\nTexas will have Joey Gallo and Ed Lucas travel from their Arizona Fall League team in case Beltre needs to be removed from the roster, a decision that also would rule Beltre out of the AL Championship Series .\nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons said Donaldson felt light-headed while playing defense in the top of the fifth, forcing the AL MVP candidate to come out.\n“They check for concussions, and apparently he passed all the tests,” said Gibbons, a MacArthur high grad and former Missions manager.\nYovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs in five innings.\n“That’s what we really needed from him,” Banister said of Gallardo, who is 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against Toronto.\nKeone Kela , Jake Diekman and Sam Dyson finished, with Dyson getting a save.\nPitching on 11 days’ rest, Price (0-1) allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He dropped to 1-6 with a 4.79 ERA in 11 postseason games, and is 0-6 in six playoff starts.\n“I expect to have better results,” a subdued Price said.\nBlue Jays slugger Jose Bautista hit a solo homer in the sixth, then left with a sore right hamstring after popping out in the eighth. The Blue Jays said Bautista is expected to play Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:27:12.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
