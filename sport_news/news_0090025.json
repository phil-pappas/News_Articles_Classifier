The kids are from the programs James has started through his family's foundation. \nDuring the summer, James announced a partnership with the university to provide free four-year educations to city students who qualify. \nObama recently launched her Reach Higher public awareness campaign to encourage students to aim higher than just a high school diploma. \nJames, who went from high school to the pros, grew up in Akron and the 30-year-old father of three has spent much of his career giving back to his community. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:40:03.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
