Customers can also get the most up-to-date outage information, or report an outage, by downloading the myPSE app for smartphones here . \nDo not call 911 if your power is out, unless your safety is at risk. Report the outage to PSE online, or by calling 1-888-225-5773. \nDuring storms, customers should keep an emergency kit handy and stay away from downed power lines, according to advice posted on PSE’s website. \nPSE offers these steps to follow during an outage: Turn off lights and appliances. Leave one light switch on so you’ll know when your power is back on. Use flashlights instead of candles. Keep your freezer and refrigerator doors closed and open them only when it is necessary. Never use a gas range, indoor cooker, charcoal or gas barbecue for heating. Close curtains and drapes to keep the heat in. Wear warm clothes in layers. \nDrivers, remember, if you come to an intersection where the streetlights are out, treat it like a four-way stop. \nDuring a windstorm it’s not uncommon to find downed power lines. PSE says to assume it’s energized and stay as far away as you can before calling 911 or 1-888-225-5773 to report it. \nDo not drive over a downed power line. Even if they’re not energized, downed wires can get entangled with your vehicle and cause further damage. \nGet more safety tips at http://pse.com/safety/Pages/default.aspx . \nWritten by Staff · Filed Under Local News \nCopyright © 2015 by Issaquah Press Inc.
