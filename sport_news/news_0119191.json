Eugenie Bouchard sues over U.S. Open... Trailing the Patriots 27-21 in the fourth quarter of the team's eventual 34-27 loss, the Colts brought on the punt team on fourth down on their own 37-yard line. However, before the snap, the entire team, including punter Pat McAfee, lined up wide to the right with only wide receiver Griff Whalen as the center and safety Colt Anderson lined up to take the snap. Outnumbered around the ball, Anderson was immediately mobbed and tackled once Whalen snapped the ball. The play gave the Patriots a short field and they scored six plays later to take a 34-21 lead with less than 13 minutes remaining in the game. After the game, Pagano took responsibility for the play, telling ESPN.com it was a \"communication breakdown\" on a play designed to catch the opponent misaligned or with 12 men on the field. While Pagano said he had a conversation with Whalen on the sideline after the play, he wouldn't reveal what they discussed. Video of Pagano on the sideline broadcast by NBC during the game seemed to show him saying \"Why did you snap it?\" to Whalen as he came off the field. The play was just one of two major special teams mistakes by the Colts that the Patriots capitalized on. \nIn the first half, a failed onside kick also gave the Patriots a short field to work with and they also responded with a touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:46:42.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
