Jagr will begin his 22 nd NHL season as the top-line right wing for the Florida Panthers, who open at home against Voracek and the Flyers for a 7 p.m. game. \n\"I think he'll play two more years ... at least,\" Voracek predicted of Jagr, who turns 44 in February. \nJagr has said he wants to play until he's 50 , and still in amazing shape and still producing. Playing for the Devils and Panthers last season, No. 68 scored 17 goals and 30 assists for 47 points in 77 games. \n\"He's amazing,\" said Flyers forward Brayden Schenn, also a teammate to Jagr in Philadelphia. \"You don't don't see guys playing at 43 and not only that, but he's sstill is a dominate player. He's still very tough to defend and he's always fun to watch.\" \nJagr may be more fun to watch this season because he says he's growing back his mullet, his hairstyle for his first nine NHL seasons. \n\"Game one we won't see much of a mullet, but maybe by game 82 he'll have that big curly one back,\" Schenn said. \"That's what he's known for .. the jersey tucked with the mullet sticking out!\" \nVoracek isn't so sure Jagr will wear it wear not that he's a lot older. \n\"I don't think it's going to be very dark back there,\" he said. \"There will be some grays in it.\" \nNew Flyers coach Dave Hakstol joked, \"There's got to be some marketing dynamic around that, huh?\" Flyers coach Dave Hakstol joked. \nAsked if he ever had a mullet, Hakstol said, \"Not that good. ... \"I don't think anybody could do it quite that well.\" \nThe same goes for Jagr's greatness on the ice. He's now fifth all-time in goals (722), sixth in assists (1,080) and fourth in points (1,802) ... numbers that would be a lot higher if he hadn't missed a full season due to an NHL lockout and three more playing in the KHL. \n\"Let's be honest, it's just him and hockey,\" Voracek said. \"He doesn't have a girlfriend. As far as I know, he doesn't have kids. The only thing he's got is hockey. He puts 100 percent in it. If you put 100 percent in something all your life, that's what you're going to get and it's impressive.\" \n\"To be around Jagr that year in Philly ... it was an awesome experience and I'm glad I got to play with him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:17:00.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
