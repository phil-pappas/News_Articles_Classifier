We may be about to find out, as Manny Pacquiao announced Thursday he is in talks with Floyd Mayweather about staging a rematch of last May's bout . Business Insider reports Mayweather is currently retired, but money—May's fight brought in a record $600 million in revenue—could lure him out. Pacquiao blames a shoulder injury for his loss to Mayweather in May and says he wants to get one more fight in before he retires to concentrate on politics full time, starting with the Philippine elections next May, according to Yahoo Sports . And who knows? If it happens, maybe there'll even be some actual boxing in in the Fight of the Century Part Two. Manny Pacquiao says he wants to end his boxing career with a rematch against Floyd Mayweather. And it may actually happen.
