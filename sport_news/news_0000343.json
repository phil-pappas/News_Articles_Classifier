That should come in Game 3 back here in Toronto. Cueto, like David Price in Toronto, was the key trade-deadline piece for the Royals, giving them another strong arm in the rotation. His eight-innings, two-run, eight-strikeout, zero-walk line from the clincher on Wednesday against Houston makes him the Royals’ best starter at the moment. He was just 4-7 since coming over from Cincy in the trade, but has pitched well in his past six starts, including two turns against Houston. Versus the Jays, he took the loss in his first start in a Royals uniform, giving up three earned runs over six innings. Troy Tulowitzki saw him twice in a short span — first while he was still with Colorado and then with Toronto. He is 0-for-6 against the Royals starter. Jose Bautista, Ben Revere and Justin Smoak are a combined 0-for-9 against Cueto. Pillar, Edwin Encarnacion and Donaldson have all had some success against Cueto this season.
