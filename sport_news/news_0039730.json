Bautista doesn’t have to look for a fight. Every game, for him, seems to be one. Internally and externally. \nMonday is his 35th birthday. It is also Game 3 of the American League Championship Series and, if Bautista were looking for any kind of fight, he’s certainly found a tough one here. The Blue Jays trail the Kansas City Royals by two games after two games. \nThus far, just days from the crazy celebration of Wednesday night, he has yet to accomplish much of anything in the ALCS. This, as many already have said, should be Bautista’s time to go national, to make an impact on the other side of the border. He feels that intensely, takes all of this very personally. \nThe subtext of his whole life in baseball has been about proving people wrong. And, along the way, he has steamrolled all over them. Obliterating the doubters. He’s a fighter with a lifelong chip on his shoulder, a persona with a little professional wrestler mixed in. He is part-athlete, part-thespian, caught up his own character, his own brand. He is the defiant leader in victory and can be the finger-pointing heel in defeat. Few Toronto athletes have ever been as successful or complex. \nBut production-wise, it’s been hard to look the other way. He has been one of the best players in baseball and that wasn’t enough for him. He yearns to be more than even that. He wants to be a brand. He wants the stage. He wants to win. There may be a certain humility to his slugging teammates Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion. There is almost no humility to Bautista: He is too overt, too wound-up for that. \nHe is an old man on this team, an old man in baseball but on Monday night a pitcher 11 years younger than him will be asked to bring the Blue Jays back in this series while another pitcher, 15 years younger, may be called upon to close. This is their beginnings on the national stage. This may be Bautista’s only shot — and already he became international with his Game 5 home run against Texas, the bat flip, the body language, the debate and discussion that followed: Not the biggest home run in Blue Jays history, just the most talked-about. \nThat matters to Bautista. Being a point of conversation. Being a baseball player who matters. \n“There’s a saying in baseball,” said David Price, talking about how Bautista hits a fastball. “You can’t sneak cheese past a rat.” \nAnd then he made sure people understood that he wasn’t calling Bautista a rat. \nSome have. Umpires, privately. Other managers. Fans in opposing cities. Players on other teams. In Game 1 against the Royals, he struck out on three consecutive pitches he didn’t swing at. He then gave umpire Tony Randazzo the Bautista evil eye. In Game 2, he struck out again on a called third strike and basically sunk to the ground on his knees. He can’t help himself, even without a hit since the Rogers Centre home run. It’s always someone’s else fault with Bautista — that is part of his strength, part of his weakness. \nHe can be the flip-the-bat playoff hero who turned on a nation and angered another one. And he can be, as he was in the clubhouse Saturday night, cold enough to look the other way, almost with a certain disdain, and distance himself from teammate Ryan Goins, who personally took the blame for the pop fly in Game 2 that landed between them. \nBautista could have played the part of supportive teammate here Saturday night, could have been a decent teammate the way Russell Martin was, the way Troy Tulowitzki was. Instead, he came across as a singular ass, which he can be at times, putting a wall between himself and the kid who is eight years younger than him. Bautista, not necessarily self-aware at times, may not have realized the impression he left after Game 2. And in his case, he probably doesn’t care. \nThat’s why he can be the most popular Blue Jay on a Monday, the least popular on a Tuesday. \nHe loves me, he loves me not. Fans play that game with Bautista, sometimes series-to-series, sometimes week-to-week. \nManager John Gibbons said the other day: “He’s been one of the top players in baseball for the past five or six years. But we never got to the post-season. I don’t think he’s had a chance to show off how good he is.” \nThat chance came against Texas in the craziest of all innings. And he was the last out Saturday night, with two on base and two out. A home run then would have tied the game. He flew out to right field and the only celebration was in the stands at Kauffman Stadium. \nThe game Monday night is paramount for the Jays. It’s election night in Canada. It’s Bautista’s birthday. It’s the biggest game in Toronto since last week’s biggest game. \nAll of this matters to Bautista, which is why he was so critical of Alex Anthopoulos a year ago, publicly planning how to get the message out. And this is why he was excited like a little kid sending exclamation mark texts this year when Anthopoulos started loading up at the trade deadline. \nWhat the Jays need from him now isn’t fire or anger or defiance: They need production. \nEspecially with Encarnacion playing with a sore finger. Especially with Ben Revere not getting on base. Especially after the highest scoring team in baseball scored three runs in two games against Kansas City and usually needs five a game to win. \nOnly four players in the American League hit more home runs than Bautista’s 40. He ended up eighth in OPS and third in RBIs. He may not be the outfielder he used to be, a little slower, a little less arm, a little jump gone, but offensively he remains a tour de force in the Blue Jays’ bopping lineup. \nSince the home run at the Rogers Centre, Bautista doesn’t have a hit. He’s 0-for-5 against the Royals, who have pitched around him, walking him four times. The Jays are hitting .130 with runners in scoring position. The combination of Donaldson, Bautista and the banged-up Encarnacion are 3-for-19. Leadoff man Ben Revere is 0-for-9 in the series. \nThat puts the top four Jays batters at 3-for-28. A .107 batting average. \nThat isn’t the way Jose Bautista, all bottled-up and bothered, full of swagger, arrogance and pomposity, sees this ending. He had his great moment of the post-season, one of those baseball moments that will last forever. \nThat’s not enough for him. He wants more of them.
