We keep battling. We bought in for 11 games.\"\nOn Sunday, the veteran coach said \"the offensive and defensive staffs got their marching orders to come back to me with a plan.\" And a bit later, he said about the offensive coaches, \"If I don't like their plan, I'll make my own plan.\"\nLafayette (1-5) is in freefall at the midpoint of the season. The team has been decimated by injuries on both sides of the ball that began piling up long before the season ever started and it hasn't had the backup support to compensate for the losses. The defense has given up 34 points or more in five of the six games and has scored more than one touchdown only once all season.\nThe staff began two weeks ago to shift players from one side to the other, and there's likely to be even more of that this week because the two players who started at cornerback on Saturday will not play against Harvard â€” Matt Smalley because he tweaked a hamstring injury against the Hoyas and Phillip Parham because of a death in the family.\nThose setbacks, though, are only a small fraction of what has been somewhat of an epidemic of injuries that have torn apart the infrastructure of the team.\nTwelve players, six of them expected starters, including defensive standout Chris Brockman and offensive guard John Hoffman, were written off before the first game. Seven more starters, including offensive linemen Connor Staudle and David Miller and defensive starters Draeland James, Steve Mercado and Kaizer Butler, are among the in-season wounded.\nStaudle, Miller and James may still get some playing time in upcoming weeks. Mercado and Butler both had shoulder surgery last week and are done for the year.\nThe list of players who have missed anywhere from a game or two to most or all of the season is staggering, but Tavani knows that he can only continue to work with those who have survived the carnage.\n\"I can do a lot of things, but I'm not a miracle worker,\" Tavani said. \"We have to deal with it. We're not the only ones this happens to.\"\nHe knows, too, that the one-sided defeats have not sat well with even some of Lafayette's most loyal supporters. \"I'm not hiding,\" he said, but he added, \"the fans have a right to be upset. That's OK. But I'm not listening to the noise. I'm only interested in our kids. Everybody can say what they want, and they can have their opinion; they don't have to buy a ticket if they don't want to. I've been around long enough. Stuff like that never affected me and never will.\"\nBut can these Leopards change their spots? Can a team that has given up an average of 220.7 yards rushing and 224.2 passing per game find a way to slow down an offense that has rushed for 201.8 and passed for 274 per game? And, can an offense that has scored only nine TDs (four in its only victory) in six starts find a way to succeed against a defense that has give up just five TDs (four in one game)?\n\"We're on fall break, so the kids have a little extra time to take a hard look at everything,\" Tavani said. Stay tuned.\nRetired sports columnist Paul Reinhard is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:23:06.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
