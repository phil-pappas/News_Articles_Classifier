Talese/Doubleday, $26.95\n 306 pages\nBy MICHAEL UPCHURCH/Special to The Oregonian\nIt feels a little odd to say that Booker Prize-winner Margaret Atwood (\"The Blind Assassin\") has written the fiction equivalent of a popcorn movie.\nBut \"The Heart Goes Last\" -- with its intrigue, action sequences and pop culture nods (sex robots! Elvis impersonators!) -- is, in its way, Pure Popcorn Novel.\nWhile it starts from a dystopian premise, it soon veers into farcical \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" territory, complete with \"a magic love potion\" and cravenly befuddled lovers. It's campy, raunchy, twisted and sinister in ways that all but shout, \"Film treatment, please!\"\nIrritable Stan and his ditsy wife Charmaine aren't faring well in \"the big financial-crash business-wrecking meltdown\" that's afflicting the U.S., especially the Northeast where unemployment hovers at 40 percent. They're living out of their car and scraping by on odd jobs, while fending off gangs, vandals and other predatory critters.\nSmall wonder, then, that a TV ad for the Positron Project catches their eye.\n\"Work with like-minded others!\" its pitchman says. \"Help solve the nation's problems of joblessness and crime while solving your own! Accentuate the positive!\"\nStan and Charmaine fall for his spiel, despite warnings from Stan's shady brother that it's a bad idea. Soon they find themselves living in the ultimate gated community, where residents are never allowed out and the outside world is never allowed in.\nThe economic model for this would-be utopia is most unusual. The population is divided 50-50 between civilians and prisoners, and once a month they swap roles. Residents of the Pleasantville-like town of Consilience abandon their homes and go to Positron, the project's jail, while released prisoners resume their civilian roles in Consilience.\nWhether \"free\" or behind bars, project participants have jobs that keep them fully employed, and all their personal needs are met. (Even the jail food is \"three-star quality.\") Their activities are constantly monitored, but this invasion of privacy seems a small price to pay for such a sense of security.\nLike most utopias, however, this one has some failings built into it. The Pollyanna-ish Charmaine appears to be the first to go off the rails when she embarks on a frenzied love affair during \"switchover days -- those few hours at the start of the month when prisoners and civilians exchange places.\nHer prison job in \"Medications Administration\" is a truer indicator of all that's wrong with the Positron Project. She earnestly tries to bring a \"human touch\" [88] to the \"Special Procedure\" that Positron's \"incorrigibles\" undergo, but there's no real disguising what she's doing to them. Stan, driven by his own lust-sparked delusions, falls down the Positron rabbit hole, too.\nResult: Both he and Charmaine are coerced into anti-Positron conspiracies.\nAtwood is blithely irreverent toward the story she's telling, and even more so toward its two central characters, whose agitations and agonies she continually undercuts and deflates.\n\"He's intensely, painfully alive,\" she writes when Stan is in a tight fix. \"His body is massive, like rock, like granite; though possibly a little soft around the middle.\" Charmaine's travails elicit even more bitingly cheesy writing.\nThe real intelligence of the novel resides in the manipulative figures who use this dim-witted couple to their own ends. They supply the literary allusions, gallows humor and pop-culture references. They also have the final word on Positron's sealed world of role play and role assignment.\n\"You never know, do you?\" one of them asks. \"If the person is real or not.\"\n\"Heart\" may be Atwood Lite â€“ but it's tasty.\nReading: Atwood reads from \"The Heart Goes Last\" at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 13, at Powell's Books at Cedar Hills Crossing.\nNovelist Michael Upchurch (\"Passive Intruder\") is the former staff book critic for The Seattle Times .", "external_links": ["http://margaretatwood.ca/", "http://www.powells.com/locations/powells-books-at-cedar-hills-crossing/", "http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780771008634-4", "http://www.powells.com/biblio/2-9780385540353-42"], "published": "2015-10-06T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:07:43.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
