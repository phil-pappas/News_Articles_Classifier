Thanks to the retreating monsoon, which is at its peak during this time of the year in these parts, two sessions were lost on Day Two of this contest, which now looks set to be decided on the first innings lead basis.\nWhen play finally began after overnight rain had left the ground staff fighting a daunting battle to dry out the wet conditions, Andhra, resuming at 170 for two, had moved to 213 for four, with Ricky Bhui completing his maiden hundred before losing his wicket to a silly stroke. Much of the hosts' hopes to collect at least three points out of this rain-marred game now rest on skipper Mohammad Kaif, who is batting on a solid 89 (311b, 12x4, 1x6). If they have to get something out of their long trip here, Mumbai somehow have to find a way to dismiss this old, wily fox.\nThe visitors would have been in a stronger position had skipper Aditya Tare latched on to an edge offered by debutant K Ashwin Hebbar off Balwinder Singh Sandhu jr behind the stumps. Armed with the new ball, Mumbai's pacers put in a much better show on Friday, with Sandhu scalping both the dangerous-looking Bhui, who was caught brilliantly by Shreyas Iyer at short mid-wicket, and AG Pradeep, castled for a blob, in a short time.\nDuring the course of his 103-run knock (214 balls, 13x4, 2x6), Bhui became the first Andhra batsman to score a hundred against Mumbai. At 19, he is also the youngest from the state to score a ton in the Ranji Trophy.\nSandhu didn't agree that Mumbai could've been far better with the ball on Day One. \"We bowled well yesterday too. We executed our plans well today, sticking to the areas where we planned to bowl,\" he said.\nThe seamer praised his captain for planning Bhui's dismissal well with his innovative field placings on the on side. Tare placed two close-in fielders on the leg side to choke up the runs for Bhui, who eventually cracked under the pressure as he topedged a ball while going for a wild heave.
