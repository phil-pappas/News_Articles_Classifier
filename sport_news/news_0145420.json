(Photo: KELLY GAMPEL / Staff Photo) Story Highlights Elmira leads Section 4 in scoring at 54 points per game Corning has won four straight since loss to Maine-Endwell Notre Dame can secure division title with win over Groton \nTwo surging high school football teams, and some of the most dynamic players in Section 4, will square off Saturday afternoon at Ernie Davis Academy when Elmira hosts Corning in a first-place clash. \nGame time is 1:30 p.m. at Marty Harrigan Field. \nElmira comes in 5-0, ranked 21st in the state in Class AA and with a Section 4-best average of 54 points per game. Defending Section 4 Class AA champion Corning (4-1) has reeled off four straight victories, averaging 42 points during that streak. Long scoring plays, physical play from the offensive lines and minimal mistakes have been hallmarks for both offenses. \nThe respect level for each other is in line with the results. \n\"Elmira is dominant. They're phenomenal,\" Corning head George Bacalles said after watching the Express score 52 first-half points last week against Syracuse Nottingham \"I think they are deeper than they were last year, and they're one heck of a football team. It's going to take an all-out effort from us to give them a game.\" \nSince the mergers of Elmira Free Academy and Southside, and Corning East and Corning West, this matchup has become the most anticipated regular-season game in the area. Last year Elmira rolled to a 30-0 victory over Corning in Week 5, but the Hawks bounced back for a 16-0 win over the Express in the sectional finals. \n\"I think it's real good two rather local, rather close teams get to play against each other,\" Express head coach Jimmy McCauley said. \"It will be a battle of the two double-wing teams. We've got to make sure we're alignment sound, make sure we're coached up, make sure the kids are ready and prepared as much as possible.\" \nBoth teams are 2-0 in Division 1 of the Section 4 Football Conference, sharing first place. Elmira can wrap up a third straight division title with a victory, while a Corning win would put the Hawks in position to claim the division with a win against Binghamton next week. \nElmira's offense has produced 8.7 yards per rush attempt, with the Express averaging 363 yards on the ground even with the starters sitting out the second half in each of the three games: an 80-8 win over Central Square, a 53-0 win over Ithaca, and a 59-6 victory over Nottingham. \nSenior wingback Dashaun Sutton leads Elmira with 731 yards and 13 touchdowns on 83 carries, with another touchdown on an interception. Allaah Sessions, also a senior wingback, has carried 55 times for 518 yards and 10 touchdowns, with four catches for 130 yards and three scores. Fullback Devon Torres reeled off a 34-yard touchdown run last week, and quarterback Anthony Aumick has produced big plays with his arm. \n\"Just like last year, they have the triple-headed monster, I guess you could say, in terms of Sutton, Allaah Sessions and then Torres, who proved in the Nottingham game that he's just as capable of breaking a big play,\" Bacalles said. \"Aumick does a great job of putting good touch on his passes, so we're going to have to play a great game.\" \nCorning's offense, which utilizes the option and double wing, has been led by senior running back Devon Sullivan. He has 14 touchdowns this season, all over the past four weeks, and two 200-yard rushing games. \nElmira will counter with a defense that has been dominant the last three weeks and has allowed an average of 221 yards per game, even with giving up 525 in a 44-43 win over Binghamton. Corning's offense has erupted since a 54-7 season-opening loss to four-time defending state champion Maine-Endwell. \n\"I think they're real explosive,\" McCauley said. \"They've got a lot of speed. They do a lot of things. We've got to be prepared, and we'll make sure we do that as far as getting film done and guys making sure they're lined up correctly and know our assignments.\" \nOther games this week: \nGroton (3-2, 2-1 Division VIII) at Elmira Notre Dame (4-1, 2-0), 7 p.m. Friday : Notre Dame returns to action after winning by forfeit last week against Candor, which didn't have enough eligible players who were healthy. This game takes its place as the homecoming contest for the Crusaders. \nNotre Dame can wrap up the Division VIII title and a berth in the Section 4 Class D playoffs with a victory. This will be the first home game for the Crusaders since their victory against Thomas A. Edison to start the season. \nGroton is coming off back-to-back lopsided victories: 53-12 over Newfield and 53-26 against Spencer-Van Etten. The Indians' lone division loss came 33-28 to Moravia, which fell at home to Notre Dame, 30-8, two weeks ago. \nHorseheads (3-2) at Johnson City (2-3), 7 p.m. Friday : Last week's 37-6 victory over Ithaca gave Horseheads its third win of the season, the most for the program since the 2006 team posted a 5-5 record. \nJohnson City played Maine-Endwell tough last week before falling 45-30, the 56th consecutive victory for the Spartans. \nFew players in the section can match the productivity of Horseheads senior quarterback Ben Clark, who has 70 completions in 104 attempts for 1,064 yards and 13 touchdowns. He also has 58 rushes for 349 yards and a touchdown. \nThomas A. Edison (1-4) at Whitney Point (0-5), 7 p.m. Friday : Whitney Point is another team coming off a forfeit loss because of a lack of healthy players, with the Eagles unable to take on two-time defending Class C state champion Chenango Forks. Whitney Point has scored just two touchdowns in its four games. \nEdison fell to Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour, 58-8, last week after rallying for a 16-12 victory over Spencer-Van Etten in Week 4. \nWaverly (4-1) at Greene (2-3), 7 p.m. Friday : Waverly steps out of division play after losing a first-place Division III showdown to Chenango Valley last week by a 22-12 score. \nGreene has lost three straight games, to Deposit/Hancock, Chenango Forks and Newark Valley. Those teams have a combined record of 14-1. Last week the Trojans fell 14-12 to Newark Valley, which two weeks ago beat a Tioga team that was ranked No. 1 in the state in Class D. \nMoravia (3-2) at Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour (4-1), 7 p.m. Saturday at Odessa : Watkins Glen/O-M clinched a berth in the Section 4 Class C semifinals with last week's 58-8 victory over Edison. Neither Watkins Glen nor O-M had qualified for the Section 4 tournament since the state playoffs began in 1993. \nThe teams have three common opponents. Moravia has a 26-6 win over Edison, and losses of 34-26 to Dryden and 30-8 to Notre Dame. WG/O-M was a 54-32 winner over Notre Dame and held off Dryden, 22-19. \nThe Seneca Indians have rushed for more than 2,000 yards this season, average 9.3 yards per carry, and have four backs with more than 400 yards: Ryan Pruitt has 507 yards on 46 carries, Austin Dalrymple has 465 yards on 56 rushes, Jordan Rappleye has 439 yards on 52 attempts, and fullback Ian Chedzoy has 31 carries for 438 yards. \nWEEK 6 SCHEDULE \nGroton at Elmira Notre Dame, 7 p.m. \nHorseheads at Johnson City, 7 \nThomas A.
