He's one of those players who can make the team feel better.\"\nBut Luis Enrique was quick to take the pressure of being Barca's focal point in attack off Neymar's shoulders.\n\"We try to work as a group,\" the coach said. \"We have our leader in Leo Messi — we cannot seek new leaders constantly.\"\nBarca has kept just two clean sheets in all competitions this season, relying on outgunning its opponents as the club sits on top of its Champions League group and level on points with La Liga leader Real Madrid.\n\"What is important is our path throughout the season — we are aware that we need to improve,\" Luis Enrique added. \"When we have a defensive situation in which we are conceding too many goals, it is not just a problem in the defense, but the entire team, starting with the coach. We never stop trying to find solutions as a group and we are working every week. In our last game I think the problems were solved.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:03:03.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
