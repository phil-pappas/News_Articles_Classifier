(Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images) \nDespite the team’s 1-2 start to the season, Marcus Mariota is a solid play against the Buffalo Bills. \nMariota ranks fifth in NFL’s passer rating (109.2) and only drops to eighth when you factor in dropped passes, throw aways, spikes, and yards in the air (96.06). He’s thrown eight touchdowns with only two interceptions while piling up 833 passing yards. And for a rookie, he is performing extremely well under pressure and when faced with a blitz. \nHis main receiver, Kendall Wright, has caught 13 of 20 passes for 213 yards and two touchdowns plus is 2 for 3 in the red zone, including one of those scores. \nBuffalo, on the other, cannot seem to stop quarterbacks this year. They are allowing the fourth most fantasy points to the position and have easy targets in cornerbacks Stephon Gilmore and Nickell Robey, who are allowing 1.39 and 1.18 yards per snap in primary coverage, respectively. \nRobey has been especially porous: opposing quarterbacks have a 91.6 rating against with almost half of the yards allowed coming after the catch (79 of 151).
