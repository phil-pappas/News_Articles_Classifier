(Photo by Bruce Bennett Studios/Getty Images) New York Rangers fans didn't have to suffer quite as long as Chicago Cubs fans between championships.\nAdChoices Their wait was 54 years between Stanley Cup victories.

Starting bid: $50,000.\nSo if Mark Messier, Brian Leetch & Co. brought tears to your eyes in 1994, and you have deep pockets, this is the ultimate piece (or pieces?) of New York Rangers Stanley Cup memorabilia.\nThe auction begins Monday, and the complete listing can be found here.\n(H/T The Hockey News )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.goldinauctions.com/The_Complete_1991_2013_NY_Rangers_Hockey_Rink_from-LOT19022.aspx", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/you-can-buy-the-madison-square-garden-rink-that-the-rangers-won-the-1994-stanley-cup-on/"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:16:20.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
