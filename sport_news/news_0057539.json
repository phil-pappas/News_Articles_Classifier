Running back Marshawn Lynch #24 of the Seattle Seahawks rushes... Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch is out for Seattle's Week 5 matchup with the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals.\nLynch suffered a hamstring strain versus the Chicago Bears in the Hawks' Week 3 win and didn't play in last week's victory over the Detroit Lions. The 29-year-old was initially listed as not participating in Thursday's practice, which was later revised to list him as a limited participant.\n\"He actually did get a little bit of work, and he is running very well,\" head coach Pete Carroll told reporters after practice on Friday. \"However, it's just two weeks now and he's just getting over it.\"\nCarroll said Lynch was close to returning from what Carroll called a \"legit hammy,\" but that the team didn't want to risk him re-injuring himself.\n\"We've seen some guys around the league try to come back. He could try to come back and play, but we think he'd be vulnerable,\" Carroll said. \"He needs another weekend to get through it, and then by next week, by next Wednesday or something, we think we can get him going again.\"\nMeanwhile, veteran reserve back Fred Jackson was listed as questionable after suffering a high ankle sprain against the Lions. Carroll said the 34-year-old Jackson was \"way ahead of schedule\" and called his recovery \"miraculous.\"\n\"Fred had a fantastic recovery,\" Carroll said. \"He's going (to Cincinnati), and we think he's going to make it. He'll have to work out on game day, but he looks really good and we think he's going to be able to play.\"\nWith Lynch out and Jackson still recovering, undrafted rookie Thomas Rawls figures to get a lot of touches for the Seahawks against a Bengals defense allowing just 85.8 yards per game on the ground, good for seventh in the NFL.\nCarroll also wouldn't rule out the possibility of making a roster move before the game, though they made no moves on Friday. Undrafted rookie Rod Smith is the only running back on the team's practice squad.\nCornerbacks Tharold Simon (toe) and Marcus Burley (thumb) were also ruled out on the team's Friday injury report, which was released before they finished their practice at the Virginia Mason Athletic Center in Renton.\nCarroll hinted that Simon, who hasn't played since Week 2, may be headed for a longer recovery.\n\"He dislocated his second toe and his nature has given him a toe that's got some issues, and we've just got to work through it,\" Carroll said. \"He's had surgery on his other foot, same toe. Same situation, so that's something we're trying to work thorugh right now, whether that's necessary or not.\"\nSimon missed his entire rookie season with foot injuries. He sat out most of training camp this year after undergoing surgery to repair a separated shoulder.\nBurley underwent surgery to repair a broken thumb, and Carroll said he could be available to play in a couple of weeks.\nWith Simon and Burley out, DeShawn Shead and free safety Steven Terrell will likely provide depth at cornerback, assuming they don't make a move to add another player. Terrell was listed as probable after missing the last two games with a hip flexor injury.\nDefensive end Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder), cornerback Tye Smith (hip) and linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis (hamstring) were all listed as doubtful for Sunday's game, while defensive tackle Brandon Mebane (groin), wide receiver Ricardo Lockette (shortness of breath) were listed as probable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:47:21.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
