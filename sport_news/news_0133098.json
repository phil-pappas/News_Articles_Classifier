What the tournament won’t have, for the first time, is a home team. \nSince beginning in 1999, the Holiday Shootout has evolved into one of the top girls basketball tournaments in the country. Each year, nationally-ranked teams and players and future All-Americans have come to Naples to play in small high school gyms. \nEach year the staple was Barron Collier, which hosted the tournament until it moved to St. John Neumann in 2013. The Cougars hung with the national powers, too. They are the only Southwest Florida team to win the Holiday Shootout, which they did in 2008 before winning their second state championship in three years that season. \nBarron Collier will not play in this year’s Shootout from Dec. 29-31 at Neumann. Cougars coach Mike Hamburg opted out of the field for the first time so he could spend the holidays with his aging parents in New Jersey. \n“It was a very hard choice,” said Hamburg, Barron Collier’s coach since 2000 and the first person to guide a Southwest Florida girls basketball team to a state title. “It took months. But family comes first. I wanted to make sure I got up there one last time.” \nShootout organizer B.A. Crawford understands Hamburg’s situation and said Barron Collier will always have a spot in the field in the future. \nCrawford and Kelvin Powell, who helps select McDonald’s All-Americans, have assembled another strong field. The 16 teams come from 10 states, and include five state champions and one national champ. \nMiami Country Day highlights the American Division. Last season the Spartans won the Class 3A championship before winning the Dick’s Sporting Goods High School Nationals in New York City’s Madison Square Garden. \nRanked seventh in the country by USA Today last season, Miami Country Day went 32-2. One of those losses came in the finals of last year’s Holiday Shootout. That’s how strong the tournament is, and organizers expect the same this season. \n“It’s going to be a good one,” Crawford said. “The competition is going to be good again. It might be the second- or third-best field we’ve had.” \nThe field is split into two eight-team divisions, with the elite teams in the American. The top bracket also includes Fairfax (Va.)-Paul VI, a defending state champion that features 10 NCAA Division I prospects and finished last season ranked No. 10 in the nation by USA Today. \nSeven of the teams in the American Division made it at least to the quarterfinals of their respective state tournaments last year. Two won state titles and three finished runner-up. \nThe National Division includes Warren Easton from New Orleans, which went 36-1 last season and won a state championship. Easton was ranked 18th in USA Today’s final poll. \nThe Holiday Shootout also features the same individual talent that has brought more than 50 college coaches to Neumann each of the past two years. There are two players committed to Division I colleges, Erika Cassell of Atlanta-Holy Innocents (North Carolina State) and Jordan Lewis of Orlando-Lake Highland Prep (Alabama). \nThe field includes at least 10 players expected to be ranked in the top 100 of their class when the season starts. \n2015 Naples Holiday Shootout", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:35:08.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
