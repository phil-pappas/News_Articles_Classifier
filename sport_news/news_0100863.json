For the second week in a row it's our distinct displeasure to bring you the NSFW Venting Thread. This is the place to cleanse yourself of the utterly indefensible, aggressively shitty effort that we just witnessed from the Georgia Bulldogs. As usual you're free to fling all the bile you want so long as you avoid threats of violence, attacks on other posters, image files which violate the site's established terms of service, or saying nice things about Butch Jones. \nAllow me to get us started. . . . \nNo one has been a more staunch defender of Mark Richt than this guy. And I still don't think he should be fired. But I didn't see a damned thing today that gives me any ammunition to make that argument. It was the same tackle-missing, poor clock-managing, special teams bed-crapping, pass-dropping, head scratcher of a loss to an inferior opponent that has become the hallmark of Georgia football. It was terrible. Sure, there are reasons for it. Chubb's injury. The physical and mental residual wear and tear from the Alabama game. But there's a fine line between reasons and excuses. And you know what they say about excuses, they're like elbows: Mark Richt is bound to have a couple. In the end this team was not mentally there, and only Tennessee being a truly awful football team kept it close in the first half. That. Was. Pathetic. \nI'm so tired of this shit. \nYour turn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:19:55.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
