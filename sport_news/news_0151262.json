Perkins, hampered by neck and back trouble that led to his removal from the closer role, spoiled a stellar start by Ervin Santana (7-5) with a first-pitch fastball that Zobrist drove off the wall in right-center field. Zobrist then scored when right fielder Torii Hunter fumbled a single by Mike Moustakas, another blemish on an awful second half for Perkins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:21:46.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
