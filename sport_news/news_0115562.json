It was like, 'OK, we got this. Let's get out there. Let's go.'\"\nLike against Memorial, East dropped a 6-1 decision to Neenah earlier this year and also fell behind, 3-1, in the rematch.\nThe Spartans' magic ran out, however, as they suffered a 4-3 loss. It was the Rockets who won their first state title, one year after losing to Arrowhead in the final.\n\"Eau Claire was a matchup I thought we could win, and I think the girls believed that,\" East coach Linda Lied said. \"It was pure excitement. But we knew Neenah was good. I told the girls all season I thought Neenah was the best team in the state. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Neenah and the program.\n\"We knew they were going to be tough. We knew we were a little dipped on energy. We barely got done, and literally 10 minutes later (the WIAA) put our doubles out. That's not a lot of time to rally and pull the troops together.\"\nCorwin agreed.\n\"Had we maybe a longer break, I think it could've gone either way,\" she said. \"But us in the finals? We were not expecting this.\"\nEast was able to cut the deficit to 3-2 after Corwin's 6-3, 6-0 victory over Kiki Risgaard at No. 1 singles, but then Neenah clinched the victory when Jordyn Lawatsch defeated Wolff, 6-4, 6-2. Horneffer then beat Megan Nasr, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, at No. 3 for the final outcome.\n\"Nobody expected us to get here except us,\" Lied said. \"I'm really proud of them for that.\"\nDIVISION 2 Madison Edgewood 7, Altoona 0: The top-ranked Crusaders won state for the second time in three years; the No. 5 Railroaders reached their first final.\nSince Division 2 was added in 1994, Saturday marked just the second time a Milwaukee-area team did not reach the championship. University School's 11-year run of reaching the tournament ended this season.\nDIVISION 1 Finals Neenah 4, Brookfield East 3. No.1 singles : Emma Corwin, BE, def. Kiki Risgaard, 6-3, 6-0.
