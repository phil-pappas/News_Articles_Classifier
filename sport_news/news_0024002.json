Hernandez is charged with murder in the shootings of Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu, two men he encountered at a Boston nightclub.\nDuring a hearing in Suffolk Superior Court last week, prosecutors said they are seeking access to physical evidence involving a third party. Their motion has been sealed from public view, and neither side would describe the evidence.\nJudge Jeffrey Locke is expected to hear arguments during a hearing Tuesday.\nHernandez is accused of following the men, then opening fire as they sat in their car at a stop light. He has pleaded not guilty.\nHernandez was convicted in a separate murder earlier this year and is serving a life sentence.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:33:31.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
