Pilcher , The Gazette October 8, 2015 | 5:57 pm \nCEDAR RAPIDS — Ben Hogan won the PGA Championship in St. Louis, Mo., the original Veterans Memorial Stadium wasn’t built and Franklin Middle School was actually a high school. \nThe year was 1948 and it was also the last time Cedar Rapids hosted the Iowa High School Athletic Association state golf meet, which Franklin happen to win at Cedar Rapids Golf and Country Club. \nThe event has returned here and Elmcrest Country will hold the Class 4A state championship, beginning today at 10:30 a.m. The final round is set for Saturday at 9 a.m. \nElmcrest was the sight of 2012 and 2013 district events. \n“Everything is ready to go and the course is in great shape,” Cedar Rapids Xavier Coach Tim O’Brien said. “I just give Kudos to Larry Gladson and Elmcrest. I really believe the successes of those two events probably made a huge impact on state coming here.” \nThis marks the fifth time overall state has been held in the Metro. Hunters Ridge hosted in 2004 and 2013. Cedar Rapids Washington, Linn-Mar and Xavier have all qualified. Players from all three teams are familiar with the Elmcrest layout. \n“It feels great,” Cedar Rapids Washington’s first-team all-Mississippi Valley Conference performer Logan Bracey said. “I know the course very well. I’m just happy be playing at state this year. This is going to be my first 4A state tournament.” \nSome are members, while others played the final round of the 2015 Rotary Pribyl there. \n“I would say it’s an awesome opportunity, because we’ve grown up on this course and we all love playing it,” Xavier all-MVC junior Sam Martin said. “It’s a lot of fun.” \nA home-course advantage is tricky, according to O’Brien. Though the Metro teams are more familiar with the course, the high expectations could cause pressure. The key is for players to use their knowledge of the home of the Zach Johnson Foundation Classic. \n“It’s a double-edged sword in my opinion,” O’Brien said. “It can work for you or against you. It’s all in your approach.” \nAs one stretch ends, Washington and Xavier will attempt to bring another streak to a halt. A Cedar Rapids team hasn’t captured a golf title since Cedar Rapids Regis, including Masters and British Open champion Johnson, won the 3A crown in 1992. \nThe Warriors have been one of the top teams in the entire state this season, sweeping MVC Super and divisional meets, the CRANDIC tournament and Tuesday’s district meet at Finkbine Golf Course in Iowa City. \nNow, they get a chance to contend for a state championship. \n“It shows we are capable,” said freshman Connor Neighbors, who led Washington at district with a 73. “We played good. We know we can do it.” \nWashington averages a little more than 303, while defending state champion Waukee and West Des Moines Dowling are the only ones better, coming in at 297. Both are in the field as well. \nThe Warriors missed the state meet, qualifying in 2013. The last time Washington won a title was in 1981, finishing second in 2002. \n“Our goal is to play well,” Bracey said. “Hopefully, the best comes out of us.” \nSix golfers averaged 79.57 or better. Junior Frank Lindwall, who tied for 10th at state two years ago, leads the way at 73.25. Bracey, Jabe Gonder and Alex and Joe Slattery have been regular contributors to a deep and balance Warrior team. \n“It’s fun to have a team where you have players from every class in your six guys,” said Washington co-head coach Dennis Goettel, who plays two seniors, two juniors, a sophomore and a freshman. “The chemistry has been great. They have pulled together for each other. \n“It’s been awesome to work with these kids. We got to where we want to go — the state meet. Now, it’s our job to see what we can get done.” \nLinn-Mar returns to the state meet. The Lions won a district meet at Bettendorf. Max Thrune leads the way, earning medalist honors at the qualifier. \nIowa City West senior J.D. Goodfellow qualified for the individual field. The MVC all-conference performer is making his first state appearance. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:44:48.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
