He attacked again in the downhill and no rider was able to follow the Italian, one of the best descenders in the world.\nPinot and Moreno were stronger than the rest of the top riders in the final climb but they failed to close the gap, which rose again a little bit in the last downhill part of the race. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:56:06.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
