The San Francisco 49ers then released him. The Raiders signed him five weeks later. \nIn a separate incident, Smith was arrested April 13, 2014, at Los Angeles International Airport. Police said Smith was randomly selected for a secondary screening and became uncooperative with the process, telling a TSA agent that he had a bomb. No charges were filed. \nDuring the 2014 season, he received a nine-game suspension for what the league called violations of its policies on substance abuse and personal conduct. \n__ \nThis story has been corrected that Smith now plays for the Oakland Raiders. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:04:20.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
