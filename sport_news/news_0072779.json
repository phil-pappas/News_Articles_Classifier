The drill always is the same: The modest car reserved online turns out to be unavailable, and for no extra charge the rental company makes available a vehicle from the next class up or higher. Only recently did this start to become bad news.\nWith the broad sweep of a hand gesture – as if to signal I'd won a prize – the counter clerk announced that my car was unavailable but that I'd be bumped up several classes to the new, gleaming black GMC Yukon Denali parked outside. My apparent ingratitude – \"I don't want it,\" I said, with a smile – furrowed her brow. I added: \"I have no need for such a big rig and have no interest in feeding gasoline to it all the way to and from Corvallis. I'm sorry, I don't want it.\"\nA supervisor approached. He seemed eager to head off any counter friction that might develop, and he wanted to explain the situation. The agency in that suburban Portland location had simply run out of standard-size automobiles, he said, and if I declined to take the Denali Yukon, he and I could ride together to a branch office perhaps 8 miles away and get the car I'd ordered or one like it.\n\"No time,\" I said, tapping my wristwatch. \"I have a business appointment at OSU and can't add an hour to this transaction.\" Nodding in the direction of the Yukon Denali, I underscored my sentiment but with a trace of irritation: \"I'm not going to pay for gas for that thing.\"\nHe said he'd \"give\" to me a \"free half tank of gas\" to take the behemoth at the same rate as I'd pay for what should have been a standard car. I did.\nBut that's when my round-trip rumination began over the preposterous inefficiency of myself, alone, roaring down a highway in a vehicle valued at $68,000 and weighing 2.7 tons, exploding gasoline in a 6.8-liter V-8 engine producing 420 horsepower, filling a lane of the I-5 so completely as to appear as a passing eclipse to slowpokes in the right lane, and seating me so high up that I was invited, if only for a few delusional moments, to think I ruled the road. Forty years ago I drove a dump truck. This felt similar except that all road noise was replaced with moody Miles Davis over the unseen Bose surround sound system.\nNo matter that the Yukon Denali is rated to get up to 22 miles per gallon on the highway (just 15 in town, however), that I made it to my appointment with time to spare, and that the vehicle's whoopee-cushion front seat tickled me enough to make me laugh when backing up too close to the car behind me. How, I wondered, could my driving this overwrought conveyance be a profitable transaction for the car rental company? I had declined all forms of insurance coverage, gravy to the company in most rental arrangements. I got my cheapo online daily rate. And I made the round trip on somewhat less than a half tank of gas -- free for me.\nI figure I'm the occasional unprofitable exception, they'll make it up over other transactions and the depreciated rate at which they'll unload the big rig when its lease is up. Meanwhile, it probably would have been expensive for the small suburban agency to have a real person on the payroll shuttle my reserved car between outlets and find a return ride to his or her station that day. Better to upgrade the next guy for free and risk a fractional loss.\nOnly then did the everyday collision between the environment and commerce become loud: how indifferent the forces of the service and manufacturing economies can be when it comes to things like efficiency, environmental impact and material consumption. I don't particularly have it in for the Yukon Denali, a fine ride; or the rental car agency, an otherwise responsive outfit. I do, however, wonder how long a growing society can get by with guys such as myself riding alone on freeways in big expensive rigs that drink gasoline and boast oversized chrome wheels that seem to do little more than to say: Watch me, I'm cool.\n-Len Reed\nLen Reed is a member of the editorial board of The Oregonian/OregonLive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:12:10.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
