Running back Marshaun Coprich finished with 144 yards and two touchdowns, while quarterback Tre Roberson had 79 rushing yards, 178 passing yards and two TDs. \nBoth are back for ISU, although Roberson is questionable with a bothersome thumb. If he can’t go, redshirt freshman Jake Colbe will get the start at quarterback. \nEven so, while Pelini claims he doesn’t care what happened last November, he certainly recognizes the dynamics of the Redbirds’ rushing attack — particularly Coprich, who leads the MVFC in rushing yards (509), TDs (7) and yards per game (127.2). \n“Everybody has to handle their responsibilities and understand what they’re trying to do,” Pelini said. “They have multiple ways they can attack you because of the running quarterback and, obviously, a really good running back.” \nThe YSU defense — which hasn’t surrendered a touchdown in each of the past two games — enters ranked first in the FCS in fewest yards allowed (243.8 per game), while it’s also first in the MVFC in fewest points allowed (16.2 per game). However, those numbers are boosted by a top-ranked FCS pass defense, as YSU’s opponents have thrown for just 69.5 yards per game. \nOn the other hand, the Penguins’ run defense ranks just sixth in the MVFC — allowing 174.2 yards per game. So, facing a run-first ISU offense that notched 161 rush yards in last week’s 21-13 win against Northern Iowa, the Penguins defense will certainly be put to the test. \n“Roberson is very mobile — he can make you miss,” junior cornerback David Rivers said. “Outside of the pocket, I feel, is where he’s most dangerous. And the running back Coprich is really good.” \nYSU counters with the MVFC’s second and fourth-leading rushers in Jody Webb (360 yards) and Martin Ruiz (311 yards). The junior runners have fared well against the Redbirds in the past — Ruiz ran for 106 yards in last year’s game and 85 yards in a 2013 win, while Webb posted games of 76 and 71 yards — although, once again, Pelini doesn’t care. \n“Hopefully they have some confidence going in because of that, but I didn’t look at their numbers from last year or pay attention to that,” he said. “These are two different football teams and it will be earned on Saturday, one way or the other.” \nThe last time YSU took part in such a marquee matchup came in 2012, when the third-ranked Penguins traveled to no. 1 North Dakota State. With both teams 4-0 at the time, the Bison trounced YSU, 48-7. \nShould the Penguins have a better showing this time and earn a victory, they would significantly boost their resume — both now and in the future — which hasn’t slipped the minds of YSU’s players. \n“We’ve been putting in some overtime and a lot of hard work going into this game,” Rivers said. “[A win] would mean a lot to the program.” \nAdded Ruiz: “It would do a lot for us. It would get our motivation up going towards the rest of the season and more eyes will open up to Youngstown State.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:53:15.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
