NewsRadio WGNS' Bryan Barrett has a preview... \n\nSmyrna and Blackman were instant rivals when the Blaze exploded onto the scene, with it's closeness to Smyrna. Then, when two-time state champion coach Philip Shadowens left Smyrna and one-year later wound up at Blackman, it intensified. Even with Coach Shadowens no longer at Blackman, it's still a big \"rival\" game. \nSmyrna coach Matt Williams says playing at Blackman is never easy... \n\nBlackman coach David Watson says Smyrna always plays with a lot of passion and pride... \n\nSmyrna looks to remain undefeated in region play. They're 3-and-0 in the region and 5-and-1 overall. Blackman is 4-and-2, with losses to Clay-Chalkville and Oakland. That makes them 2-and-1 in region play. \nKickoff is set for 7pm here on NewsRadio WGNS with Rod Edwards and Monte Hale, Jr. joining me from Blackman.
