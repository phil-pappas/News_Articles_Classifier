But it never happened.\nIt wasn’t until 2011 — when his wife discovered the mortgage hadn’t been paid in two years — that Bob hit rock bottom. His wife insisted they sell the house and part ways.\n“She said, ‘You’re gambling, I’m taking the kids and divorcing you,’” Bob said, replaying the dramatic showdown with his now ex-wife. “Then my mother-in-law corners me, screaming, ‘We’re not going to let your kids call you daddy anymore. We’re going to give them to another man to raise, because you’re not a real man.’”\nIf a football result doesn’t pan out your way, there are plenty of other fantasy sports to choose from. Source: Reuters\nBob’s first fantasy sports experience was with Small World Sports, one of the earliest and, at the time, most popular online fantasy sports sites, he said. It was free and had a growing cult following.\n“We played just for bragging rights,” Bob said. “But I fell a little behind once and suddenly felt the urge.”\nThat urge led Bob to join NFL suicide pools at up to $500 a clip. In a suicide pool, a group of players ante up an entry fee and then pick a different team each week. Pick a winner and you live another week. Pick wrong and you’re out. The winner gets the pot.\nAt the same time, he graduated from free fantasy sports to pay leagues.\n“My gambling friends and I would set up leagues for every season, and then agree on an entry fee,” Bob said, noting that his addiction, on a $35,000 a year salary, was already no small matter. “They’d say, ‘Let’s make it $100,’ but I’d go, ‘No, no, let’s make it $300.’”\nHe remembers one particularly bad weekend when he was sure he was going to win, putting himself in position to collect some serious cash.\nLeading up to that weekend, Bob remembers drafting LaDainian Tomlinson when the San Diego Charger was the league’s best running back and was about to face a weak defence.\nHowever, rather than save his bacon with a standout performance, Tomlinson ruined Bob’s payout chances with a sub-par performance.\nUnlike baseball, you can strike out as many times as you like in fantasy sports and still keep gambling. Source: Reuters\nThe subject of whether fantasy sports should be considered gambling and subject to regulation and licensing — perhaps making it harder for folks like Bob to lose their shirt — is newsy in light of the move by Nevada this week to classify daily fantasy sports as gambling.\nGambling experts believe there is little difference between traditional gambling and daily fantasy sports.\nIt wasn’t until Bob’s wife left him that he finally crashed. He thought about suicide — perhaps by crashing his car — but didn’t follow through, fearing he might inadvertently hit another car and kill innocent people. Instead, he gave Gamblers Anonymous a try.\nAnd it has worked. Bob still attends two-to-three meetings a week — even now four years after giving up fantasy sports.\nIt hasn’t been enough to win back his wife, but they get along a lot better and he continues to see his kids, albeit just two days a week plus every other weekend.\n“I took them to dinner last night,” Bob said. “They asked if I was going to a meeting afterwards. They know daddy goes to meetings all the time — they just don’t know what kind. I’ll explain it to them when they’re older.”\nAs for the tumult going on over whether one-day fantasy sports is gambling, Bob has this to say: “It’s very hard for fantasy players to get a grip these days, especially since all you need to play is an app on your smartphone.”\nBob saw a 20-something man at a recent Gamblers Anonymous meeting who had lost a lot of money playing daily fantasy sports.\nThe guy came to just one meeting but Bob hopes he continues to reach out.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/af7da8c5277e4cff62e39fa77122fa0f", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a94d0fce0f11e067c0939e5b8671af03", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7a29ec1579c4f527c7a8d6a48f003fb7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:48:38.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
