Jeremie and Lori Corcoran will be the promoters of Canandaigua Motorsports Park for the 2016 season, according to a release from the track on Tuesday. \"Lori and I have accomplished many of positive things at CMP over the past five years, even with some very trying situations,\" Jeremie Corcoran said in a statement. \"We feel that we can make some changes to our organization in 2016 and make it even better. I am committed to having one of the best Saturday night racing shows in the northeast for 2016.\" Corcoran said he will be developing a schedule for 2016 in the next two months that will include some new and exciting events. A notice on the track's website said CMP will continue to run the Racesaver 305 sprints next season, but will not be running the new DIRTcar 6-2 Crate Sprint Class. \"We have had great success with the dedicated 305 teams and we want to continue that successful relationship,\" said the website notice. \"The Big Block Modifieds, 602 Sportsman, Street Stocks and Pure Stocks will be on our race card.\" CMP will open its season with a Northeast Snocross event on March 5 and 6.
