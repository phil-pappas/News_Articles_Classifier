He was 62. \nUCLA said Meyers died at his home in Temecula after struggling with cancer for the last year. \nHe played four years for Milwaukee after being drafted second overall by the Los Angeles Lakers. Shortly after, Meyers was part of a blockbuster trade that sent him to the Bucks in exchange for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. \nThe 6-foot-8 Meyers led UCLA in scoring at 18.3 points and rebounding at 7.9 in his final season, helping the Bruins to a 28-3 record. He had 24 points and 11 rebounds in their 92-85 victory over Kentucky in the NCAA title game played in his hometown of San Diego. \nHis younger sister, Ann Meyers Drysdale, also played at UCLA in her Hall of Fame career.
