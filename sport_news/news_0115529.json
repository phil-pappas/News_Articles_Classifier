Can coach Frank Vogel make the transition work? A new Pacers season will start Wednesday on the road against the Toronto Raptors and there are plenty of questions surrounding the team. \nThe first couple of months should be quite intriguing as the Pacers try to establish themselves as a small-ball team that can space the floor and outscore opponents. Vogel, while trying to push the Pacers back into contention in the Eastern Conference, will also rely on two rookies in Myles Turner and Joe Young. \nThe season could go in many directions. Perhaps the Pacers surprise and finish atop the standings. Maybe their new experiment will not work out in its first season. Or the end result could be exactly as last year, when the Pacers fell just short of the playoffs. \nWith such possibilities, here are five major questions that loom over the team as the season begins: \nWill Paul George thrive in the new offense as the power forward? Much of the Pacersâ€™ season depends on how George performs in his new role. Throughout the preseason, George has shown that he is healthy and capable of scoring against bigger and slower defenders. The first 10 games should be a good indication of how George looks in the new system. Included in those games are the Memphis Grizzlies, Detroit Pistons and Miami Heat, teams that play with a more traditional lineup to challenge George on the defensive end. \nCharlotte Hornets' Brian Roberts, left, shoots around Indiana Pacers' Ian Mahinmi (28) during an NBA preseason basketball game, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015 in Fort Wayne, Ind. (Photo: Samuel Hoffman, AP) \nWhat will the Pacers look like on defense? For so long, the Pacers were successful because of what they did on defense. David West and Roy Hibbert anchored the team in terms of protecting the rim and the paint. With them elsewhere, Ian Mahinmi will usually be surrounded by four teammates on the perimeter. With George Hill and Monta Ellis in the backcourt, the Pacers will likely gamble more for steals to score baskets in transition. If George can return to form as a top-level perimeter defender, the Pacers have the potential to be ranked in the top 10 on defense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:22:58.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
