( John Leyba, The Denver Post ) Bronco Bus fan forum \nLongtime Broncos owner Pat Bowlen will be inducted into the team's Ring of Fame during halftime of Sunday's game, and many members of the 1997 Super Bowl team will be on hand for the ceremony. \nAs part of the week-long celebration, the Broncos will hold a dedication, naming the indoor facility at UC Health Training Center the Pat Bowlen Fieldhouse. Manning practice schedule \nSince Kubiak took over as the Broncos' coach, he has mandated a day of rest each week for quarterback Peyton Manning and other veterans to keep them fresh for game days, but especially for later in the season. \nKubiak doesn't expect to change that this week after an extended rest period with the bye. But having Manning practice Wednesday remains a possibility. \n\"We're going to talk about that,\" Kubiak said. \"I would say no, but he's had some good rest, so we'll see. I think he will practice some on Wednesday. How much, I don't know.\" Footnotes \nSunday's matchup between the Broncos and Packers will be the first prime-time game featuring opponents with records of 6-0 or better. ... Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Manning are the only players in NFL history to average more than two touchdown passes per game.
