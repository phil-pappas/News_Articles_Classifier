But it won't be the Mets . \nAccording to Bovada, the St. Louis Cardinals are the odds-on favorites to win the National League pennant. Bovada has them at 2/1 to win the N.L. and then 5/1 to win the World Series. Makes sense for a team that won 100 games and has the best record in baseball. \nThe Mets are actually third in the pecking order but slightly. The Dodgers are at 3/1 to win the National League. The Mets are at 13/4. The Cubs and Pirates are at 5/1 each. \nThe Mets will begin their playoff run Friday in Los Angeles when they face the Dodgers . Jacob deGrom will be on the mound, with Noah Syndergaard and Matt Harvey to follow.

Who knows. \nAnd here are the American League pennant odds, if you're interested. \nToronto Blue Jays: 3/2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:00:06.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
