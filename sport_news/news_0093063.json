I thought we were on task defensively. I thought we dug quite well. They were putting some gas on it and we were extending rallies. It ultimately, for us, came down to unforced errors. \n“We we’re uncharacteristically high error from an attacking perspective and even a little bit from a service perspective with a couple of them. That’s not our identity.” \nK-State hit .079 from the field, which stands as its lowest mark of the season, registering 23 attack errors and just 32 kills. \nWhile bright spots were few and far between, junior setter Katie Brand was one of them, picking up a double-double on assists (23) and digs (15). \nIt marked Brand’s 12th double-double of the season, a category in which she leads the Big 12. \nTexas (17-1, 7-0), meanwhile, didn’t do anything really spectacular on its side of ball, hitting just .246 in the match and only out-digging K-State by seven, while being outblocked by the Wildcats by only one. But Texas found a way to capitalize off of K-State’s many mistakes. \n“I think they’re good,” Fritz said of the Longhorns. “I think they are a talented volleyball team. I think they have a lot of tools. I thought they dug a lot of balls. It was difficult to find kills against them. It would’ve helped if we would’ve hit more in, would’ve given us more opportunities for sure.” \nThe first game was fairly back and forth to begin with Texas taking a slight lead. The Wildcats then went on a 6-3 run to tie the set at 10. \nThe Longhorns then went on a 15-6 run, including a 7-0 surge to give Texas the first set, 25-16. \nGame 2 was the most competitive set of the night, featuring six ties and only one lead change. \nThe Wildcats tied it at 20 with a kill by Brand before Texas rode a 5-1 run to take set two 25-21. \nGame 3 started off just as competitive as the one before, with K-State taking an early 5-1 lead. The Longhorns battled their way back and after three lead changes, added a fourth after back-to-back errors tied the set at 11 and gave Texas the lead it carried the rest of the way. \nTexas would go on a 14-5 tear to take the set and the match, 25-16. \n“There were a thousand things that we could’ve done better to put ourselves in a position to not have gone 0-3,” Fritz said. “We had opportunities to win games, we had opportunities to win points that we didn’t take advantage of. \n“No matter who’s on the other side of the net, what I hope they take from it is we have to be better. Period.” \nThe Wildcats play at Texas Tech on Saturday, beginning at 3 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:09:40.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
