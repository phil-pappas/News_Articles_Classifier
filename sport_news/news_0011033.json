The portable device, powered by battery or plugged into a common electric outlet, can be used at home or work.\nIt's been newly sanctioned to treat just-diagnosed patients, in combination with the chemotherapy drug temozolomide. Clinical studies of the device for this purpose showed people treated with the Optune/drug combination lived an average of three months longer than those treated with the drug alone.\n\"Patients newly diagnosed with this challenging and aggressive form of brain cancer now have another treatment option available,\" said Dr. William Maisel, acting director of the Office of Device Evaluation in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \"While the treatment is not a cure, it can increase survival by several months.\"\nBrain and nervous system cancers will be diagnosed in an estimated 23,000 Americans this year, killing more than 15,000, the FDA said, citing the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Glioblastoma multiforme accounts for some 15 percent of brain tumors, and it is most often diagnosed among people aged 45 to 70.\nOptune was first approved in 2011 to treat this type of brain cancer once it had progressed despite chemotherapy. It should not be used without a doctor's supervision, the agency warned.\nSkin irritation is the most common side effect, and users also have a slightly greater-than-average risk of neurologic adverse reactions, including convulsions or headaches, the FDA said.\nPeople with an implanted medical device, skull abnormality or skin sensitivity should not use Optune, the agency said.\nThe device is manufactured by Portsmouth, N.H.-based Novocure Inc.\nMore information\nVisit the FDA to learn more ", "external_links": ["http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm465744.htm", "http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:47:03.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
