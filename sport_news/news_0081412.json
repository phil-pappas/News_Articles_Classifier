Dave Johnson Contact Reporter djohnson@dailypress.com With Mikal Abdul-Saboor's injury, Kendell Anderson has rushed for 446 yards in W&M's last three games. \nWILLIAMSBURG — For now, it will be somewhat determined by the sprained ankle in question. But eventually, probably sooner than later, William and Mary coach Jimmye Laycock and his offensive staff will face an interesting question. \nAnd that is: How to divvy up the carries between Mikal Abdul-Saboor, who had rushed for 100-plus yards in seven consecutive games before his injury, and Kendell Anderson, who in the last three weeks has piled up 446 yards and scored five touchdowns? \nIf it becomes a problem, it will be a good one to have. What coach wouldn't mind having two proven runners at his disposal? \n\"We'll have to play it by ear as we go,\" Laycock said. \"We still have to see how Mikal is this week because I don't think he was 100 percent last week. He was good enough to play but not quite up to his level. We'll see how he progresses. \n\"We'll play them both, there's no question about that, and we'll let the game dictate how it's playing out. Obviously, both of them have proven to be very good backs.\" \nAbdul-Saboor ran for 1,266 and 12 touchdowns last season and was off to a good start in 2015 when he sprained his ankle against Stony Brook. Anderson took over and ran for a career-high 191 yards and two touchdowns. \nSee William and Mary's 2015 season -- from the spring game through the fall season -- in pictures. (Rob Ostermaier/Daily Press) \nThe following week at Delaware, he finished with 101 yards on 23 attempts. And in last week's 38-16 win at then-No. 14 Villanova, Anderson rushed for 149 yards and three touchdowns. \nAbdul-Saboor missed the loss at Delaware but came back at Villanova with 52 yards on 12 attempts. Laycock estimated Abdul-Saboor was about 85 percent. \nTogether, Abdul-Saboor and Anderson have rushed for 849 yards and scored seven touchdowns entering Saturday's game against New Hampshire. Anderson appreciates his increased reps of late, but he's also fine with the two-back system W&M is likely to ride the rest of the season.

Same with Mikal and backs in general. \n\"But sharing the load, that allows us to last for a long season. When you can switch out fresh legs and the defenses are tired, it's harder to tackle. … It makes it really tough for defenses now to game plan, because (it's) two running backs instead of one.\" \nAt 5-foot-9 and 200 pounds, slightly smaller than Abdul-Saboor, Anderson doesn't look like a classic power runner. But he's not shy about creating contact. \n\"Ever since I was little, I've always been a fighter,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter how big you are, you can always out will somebody.\" \nIn five games this season, Anderson has rushed for 531 yards. That's nearly as much as his total in his first two seasons (587). Many have been surprised by his emergence this season, but Laycock isn't among them. \n\"Obviously, he's a good back and he puts up a lot of yards,\" he said. \"He's a hard runner who fights for every yard he gets. He's shown that he has speed, too. We felt like he was a good back. He's gotten his opportunity and he's proven it.\" \nComing out of Westfield High in Centreville, Anderson's hope was to follow his brother's footsteps to James Madison. Jordan Anderson was a backup tailback for the Dukes, but Madison never offered. William and Mary did, and Kendell took it. \nGreen and gold runs in the family. Anderson's mother, Veronique, attended law school at W&M. She's now a lieutenant colonel in the Judge Advocate General's office at Andrews Air Force Base. \n\"The reason I'm such a fiery person is because of my mom,\" Anderson said. \"My dad was the quiet one. She was the one who got the boys hyped for the game.\" \nNOTES: \nAfter playing four of its first five games on the road, William and Mary will begin a three-game homestand Saturday against New Hampshire. … \nTen of the Tribe's 15 offensive touchdowns have been 30 yards or longer. … \nQuarterback Steve Cluley has attempted 122 consecutive passes without being intercepted. … \nThe 28 points W&M scored in the second quarter of last week's win at Villanova were its most in one period since 2007. … \nNew Hampshire has made 11 consecutive playoff appearances. \nNEXT GAME \nWHO: No. 19 New Hampshire (3-2, 1-1 CAA) at No. 24 William and Mary (3-2, 2-1). \nWHEN: Noon Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:03:19.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
