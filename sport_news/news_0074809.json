It’s unfortunate. It’s kind of how the night went.”\nIt certainly is how the fateful eighth inning went.\nPaul Janish started things by dunking a single to shallow right that barely eluded a diving Rob Refsnyder, as the second baseman’s attempt came up just short.\nBetances then threw the first of a pair of wild pitches, allowing Janish to get to second. Gerardo Parra followed with a bunt single to third.\nWith Manny Machado at the plate, Betances uncorked his second wild pitch, scoring Janish and giving Baltimore the lead.\n“I yanked it,” Betances said of the pitch. “I tried to go up with a fastball.”\nAfterward, Girardi said he would be hesitant to use Betances in Sunday’s regular-season finale since he needed 23 pitches to get through the inning.\nBetances, though, said he would be ready to go if needed and didn’t feel overused.\nThough he didn’t get knocked around Saturday, he allowed three baserunners, which included an intentional walk to Chris Davis.\nBetances headed into the game having given up just one run over his previous 10 innings, but he had walked seven and allowed five hits — an uncharacteristically high number of baserunners for him.\n“I thought I pitched well,” said Betances, who hadn’t given up an earned run on the road in his prior 38 appearances dating back to last season.\nHe picked a bad time to end that streak.\n“Unfortunately, I gave up the run there,” Betances said. “There was nothing I could do in today’s situation. It happens.”\nLately, it’s been happening all too often for the Yankees, who have lost five of six against Boston and Baltimore with home-field advantage in Tuesday’s wild-card game on the line.\n“Boston played us well and Baltimore took two from us today, but the ball is in our hand,” Betances said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under dellin betances ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:39:50.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
