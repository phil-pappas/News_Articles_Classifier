Doing away with the executive committee would be another, because for decades it has been the destination for top officials who arrive with deep, open pockets yet cannot seem to follow even the most basic ethical standards.

Another way to clean up FIFA would be for it to set an independent commission that would investigate just what went wrong with FIFA — and why and how it went wrong. And by independent, I don’t mean something that would be submitted to FIFA for edits or review. I mean something that would be made public, in full, in the end. How helpful could that be? Cycling, another sport with insidious problems that have lasted for decades, serves as an example. It underwent a year of scrutiny by what was called the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, a three-person panel that examined the sport’s doping, failed leadership, failed governance, cover-ups and conflicts of interest. That inquiry, which concluded with a report made public earlier this year, involved more than 170 interviews with people both in and out of the sport, and some of those people gave information confidentially. The report did not cause a sea change, but it did shed light on the backward way people did business in cycling, which was long overdue. At the very least, that information served as a warning to those who want to repeat history by cheating or breaking ethical rules. It showed that the world governing body of cycling would not go forward, unchecked. Soccer needs a report just as detailed and just as public, so the world can understand exactly how the beautiful game turned so ugly. Until then, the next FIFA president at the minimum must pry the hands of the current executive committee members off the neck of the organization. Only then might FIFA take its first clear breaths in years. FIFA’s member states should agree to do it now, without more delays or investigations of investigations or any other stalling tactic. They need to act before the creaking roof comes crashing in on all of them.
