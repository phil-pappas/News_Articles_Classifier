TCU just a top 10 team right now.\nâ” David Ubben (@davidubben) September 27, 2015 New Coaches Poll: 1.Ohio St 2 MichSt 3 TCU 4 Baylor 5 OleMiss...

Gary Patterson's already inexperienced defense is a full-on MASH unit, with five starters out for the season with injuries and other contributors either suspended or, in one case, on a leave of absence. And it showed Saturday. Kliff Kingsbury's offense is full of playmakers, and Horned Frogs defenders repeatedly could not tackle them. It's actually a wonder they managed to stop Tech's crazy last-ditch series of laterals.\n\"And yet I wouldn't go counting out TCU just yet. Because it's still got its own record-shattering Air Raid offense, led by Heisman contender Boykin, who put on his most remarkable performance yet Saturday.\n...\n\"TCU is not going to get through that gauntlet unscathed. That's a given. But despite what happened in 2014, a one-loss Big 12 champ still has a better chance of making the playoff than missing it, and Boykin is fully capable of delivering 11 wins.\"\nNicole Auerbach, USA Today\n\"The shootout with Texas Tech was highly entertaining, but it also exposed just how different this Horned Frogs team is from the one that garnered Playoff consideration a year ago. This TCU defense is decimated by injuries and really can't stop anyone consistently. Trevone Boykin and the TCU offense are high-powered enough to win some games essentially single-handedly, but for how long?\"\nColin Becht, Sports Illustrated\n\"With Heisman candidate quarterback Trevone Boykin--who has now passed for 918 yards with 11 touchdowns and no interceptions against the Red Raiders over the past two years--and star wide receiver Josh Doctson, among other weapons, the Horned Frogs are capable of winning plenty of shootouts. But that's an unreliable long-term strategy, and unless the defensive replacements can make tremendous improvements, it's hard to picture them having much better success against teams like Oklahoma and Baylor. TCU will face much better defenses than Texas Tech's, and it may only take a few stops to put the Horned Frogs in a hole. At this point, both the Sooners and Bears look like safer options to win the Big 12.\"\nPat Forde, Yahoo\n\"Unless the No. 3 team in the nation finds some answers defensively, TCU is not going to beat Baylor. Or probably Oklahoma. Or maybe Oklahoma State. Injuries stink, and you hate to see a program that is not a perennial contender be compromised in a potential dream season. But injuries also are part of the game, and TCU may not have the depth to overcome all its losses.\"\nPatrick Stevens, Washington Post\n\"The shame of it all is this year had all the makings of the Horned Frogs reaching a competitive peak under Patterson -- which is saying something given his phenomenal success in Fort Worth. Unlike his Rose Bowl team in 2010 when TCU was still in the Mountain West, there would be no strength of schedule argument denying the Horned Frogs a shot to play for a title if they ran the table.\"\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/news/ten-takeaways-from-a-chaotic-college-football-saturday-060809847-ncaaf.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "https://twitter.com/dalehansen/status/648304919011831808", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2015/09/27/college-football-rewind-serendipity-thy-name-is-tcu-in-wild-and-crazy-win-over-texas-tech/", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/tcu-horned-frogs-texas-tech-red-raiders-trevone-boykin-josh-doctson-big-12-playoff-092615", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2015/09/27/college-football-snap-judgments-oregon-utah-michigan-tennessee-tcu/72921898/", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/davidubben/status/647937239939284992", "https://twitter.com/BruceFeldmanCFB/status/648176567437291520", "http://www.si.com/college-football/2015/09/27/week-4-takeaways-pac-12-sec-tcu-horned-frogs?xid=si_ncaaf&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-09-28T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:54:20.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
