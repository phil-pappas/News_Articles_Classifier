And seems he's a total ladies' man just like his dad SRK. Recently, the star kid was spotted posting pictures with a mystery girl which left us wondering about the identity of the girl.\nHis Instagram posts and his deadly looks have always kept him in the news and when it comes to grabbing headlines, Aryan can definitely give his superstar father a run for his money. From his toned and sculpted body to his new gothic look, Aryan has been in news for the right reasons.\nWhile usually we see Aryan partying and posing for pictures with Amitabh Bachchan's grand-daughter Navya Naveli Nanda and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim Ali Khan, he was last seen posing with a foreigner friend of his. While the identity of the mystery girl is not yet known, we guess she's another high school classmate of Aryan's! No wonder, both of them look really adorable together.\nAnd Aryan gets another thumb up from us for his new make-over!", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:20:21.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
