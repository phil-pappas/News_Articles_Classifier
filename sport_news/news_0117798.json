(Joe Cavaretta) \nAs for Whiteside, he once again was reduced to envisioning how he could make things right alongside Wade, Dragic, Deng and Bosh. \n\"I try to put myself into those situations on defense and what I'd do on offense,\" Whiteside said, also to miss Tuesday's road preseason game against the Orlando Magic. \"I always take that approach to the game when I'm not playing, just watching it, just being a student of the game.\" \nFor as uneven as the Heat have been through three preseason games, Whiteside sees something special about to brew when he returns to the lineup. \n\"I'm really excited because there's going to be a lot of length out there with me, Bosh and Luol Deng,\" he said. \"I really don't see that many teams that are that big through their starting five.\" \nThe Spurs actually are one of them. Aldridge, the prize of this summer's free agency, closed with 17 points on 7-of-12 shooting and eight rebounds in 24 minutes. Leonard had 14 points and seven rebounds in 23, and Duncan closed with 14 and six in 24. All three sat out the fourth quarter. \nWhiteside? He again watched in his warm-ups. \n\"And I know the fans are getting anxious and I'm getting anxious,\" he said. \"I'm really excited. We just want to take our time and make sure it's not a case where it lingers.\" \nBeyond being without Whiteside, coach Erik Spoelstra also gave Amar'e Stoudemire, Mario Chalmers and Josh McRoberts the night off. Neither Stoudemire nor McRoberts will play Tuesday in Orlando, given the chance for further rest for their balky knees, with Wade also saying he will take the game off and not play in both ends of back-to-backs in the preseason. \nJohnson stepped up with a solid effort in place in Chalmers as the backup point guard, with Gerald Green again offering instant offense with that second unit, this time with 17 points in 20 minutes. Greg Whittington also had his moments, with the undrafted rookie forward potentially moving ahead of James Ennis in the Heat's roster considerations. \nAs for the Heat starters, Wade closed with 16 points in 21 minutes, while Dragic again had an uneven night, finishing with five points. \nMore Boshes \nBosh confirmed Monday that he is about to fill out an entire starting five of his own, amid news of he and his wife Adrienne expecting twins in the spring. \nAsked if he was ready for what will come next for his family, Bosh, 31, quipped, \"Um, no, I'm not ready. You're never ready.\" \nBosh has 6-year-old daughter Trinity from a previous relationships, as well as 3-year-old son Jackson and 2-year-old daughter Dylan Skye with Adrienne Bosh. \nAdrienne Bosh told People magazine that Chris has two sets of twins on his side of the family, so the dual impending arrivals were not a shock. \nwinderman@tribpub.com.
