The Blue Jays’ season is over after a heartbreaking, 4-3, defeat to the Royals in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series. \n\"I was able to come through twice,\" Bautista said. \n\"Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough.\" \nBautista became the first Blue Jay in postseason history to hit two homers in a game when he followed his solo shot in the fourth inning with a tying, two-run homer in the eighth. \nBut it was his throw from right field in the bottom half of the inning, just after a 45-minute rain delay, that allowed the Royals to score the go-ahead run. \nLorenzo Cain had reached base with a hard-earned walk off Roberto Osuna, and Eric Hosmer rapped a single down the line. Bautista fielded it cleanly and fired to second base, thinking that Hosmer might try to stretch the hit into a double. \nThe longer throw gave Cain the time he needed to score from first base. Bautista thought there was enough time to throw to second and still keep Cain at third. \n\"I felt like I cut it off quick enough to where if I threw to second I could prevent him from going to second and Cain from scoring,\" Bautista said, \"but I was wrong.\" \nFor the Blue Jays, it was a frustrating ending to a late-season surge that ended their own postseason drought dating to 1993. They had rallied from a 2-0 series deficit against Texas in the divisional round, then staved off elimination against the Royals in Game 5 in Toronto. \nAsked about his club’s resilience, Toronto manager John Gibbons said before Friday’s first pitch: \"They’ve looked and played and acted like they have all season long.\" \nThey simply couldn’t win their fifth straight elimination game. \n\"They made a run at it,\" Gibbons said. \"I really couldn’t be more proud of our guys. They laid it out every day. They’re great competitors and a fun bunch.\" \nAlex Rios had an RBI single in the seventh, but only after two marvelous plays by Toronto limited the damage. \nLeft fielder Ben Revere made a leaping grab at the fence to rob Salvador Perez of a two-run shot, and second baseman Ryan Goins made a sliding grab to rob Alex Gordon of a single. \nWe had a tremendous year, definitely didn’t have the finish that we wanted,\" Jays catcher Russell Martin said. \"But we’re definitely going to hold our heads high. \n\"I’m proud of the group we have, I’m proud how we fought. But got to give credit to Kansas City, they have a tremendous ball club and they deserved it.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:06:27.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
