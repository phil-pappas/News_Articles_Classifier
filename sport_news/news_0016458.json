Arron Afflalo will finally make his preseason debut on Friday against the Boston Celtics but the Knicks won’t be close to full strength with rookie Kristaps Porzingis ruled out with a strained quad.\nPorzingis didn’t play in Monday’s win over the Sixers and the plan is to have him participate in Friday’s morning practice and, barring any setbacks, play Saturday against the Hornets in Charlotte.\n“I can’t wait to get back on the court,\" Porzingis told reporters following Thursday’s practice in Greenburgh. “Hopefully I’ll play on Saturday. I’m healthy and 100 percent.\"\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nAfflalo has been sidelined since the first week of training camp at West Point with a left hamstring strain. He was cleared to participate in Thursday’s scrimmage and is being listed as probable against Boston.\n“It felt good,\" Afflalo said. “I had an extended vacation. The training staff has been great with me in terms of rehab. Now it’s getting acclimated with my teammates.\"\nAfflalo is expected to be the Knicks starting shooting guard and his return to the lineup allows head coach Derek Fisher to use what could be the team’s season opening starting five for the first time.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News Arron Afflalo is listed as probable vs. Celtics after suffering left hamstring strain during camp. “I got two days of training camp in, so it seems like it’s been awhile (since I played) Fisher said. “I’m familiar (with the offense). I’ve been standing here watching every day, so I’m excited. My wind is great. It’s more or less getting continuity with my teammates.\"\nRELATED: DRAFT BUST WILLIAMS EXCITED FOR FRESH START\nSaid Fisher: “He moved well today,\" Fisher said. “He’s moving in the right direction. We’ll see how he responds.\n“He obviously hasn’t played basketball in several months.\"\nAfflalo is one of Phil Jackson’s important summer signings, having inked a two-year, $16 million contract in July. His production fell off significantly last season in Portland and the Knicks, in search of a secondary scorer, are hoping that Afflalo will have a bounce back year.\nAfflalo played a supporting role to Carmelo Anthony when the pair was teammates with the Denver Nuggets. That club, however, featured more offensive talent including Chauncey Billups, Kenyon Martin and J.R. Smith, who would all eventually reunite with Anthony in New York. Afflalo, who turned 30 on Thursday, averaged a career-high 18.2 points for an Orlando Magic team that won just 23 games. Last season, Afflalo, who began the year with Denver before being traded to Portland, averaged 13.3 points. He also shot 42 percent, his lowest percentage since his rookie season.\nView Gallery The Knicks like you've never seen them before Fisher, though, believes Afflalo brings intangibles that the Knicks lacked in 2014-15.\n“He’s a team guy and he competes on both ends of the floor — sounds strange to say a guy competes on offense and defense,” Fisher said. “There’s a level of physicality and aggression Arron plays with that’s good for us.”\n* * *\nKevin Seraphin, who is fighting for minutes at back-up center, returned to practice on Thursday and is expected to play on Friday after missing the previous two games with a knee injury.\nThe Celtics have been in town since Wednesday when they played the Nets in Brooklyn. Last week, they played preseason games in Milan and Madrid.\nThe Hornets returned from China where they played the Clippers twice.
