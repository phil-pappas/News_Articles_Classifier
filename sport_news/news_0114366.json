They play at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at Kenny Wolford Park in Dresden. \nLane Dailey led the offense with a hat trick, while Joe Goggin and Carter Hagy also scored in the victory. \nControlling possession and executing set pieces led to multiple opportunities for Rosecrans, which outshot the Crusaders 18-3. \nRosecrans coach Rod Gibson said he felt the offense rebounded after a sluggish performance in a 3-0 win over Richmond Edison on Monday. \n\"With their record, we knew it wouldn't be an easy game. They have some quality players on that side,\" he said. \"We didn't play well against Edison, but it was different today. We were able to pressure them high and stay on the attack.\" \nIt took Rosecrans less than five minutes to get on the board. Hagy's free kick bounced out of the hands of Crusaders keeper Austin Fowkes, allowing Goggin to knock home the rebound at the 35:38 mark. \nAllowing that goal put the Crusaders (14-2-2) in a tough position, said SCC coach Steve Kopcha. \n\"It was uncharacteristic of us to give up those early goals,\" he said. \"You give any team momentum like that, it's tough to overcome. We knew we had time to rebound, but with their defense and keeper, we didn't have a lot of chances. \n\"Our execution wasn't what it has been all season,\" he added. \"I wished we could have played today the way we have all season.\" \nThe Bishops continued to keep pressure on the Crusader defense, and Dailey took advantage, scoring his first goal about 12 minutes later on an assist from Riley Kanavel. \nAnother set piece led to the 3-0 advantage. Aaron Gehlken's throw-in near the corner found Hagy, who headed the ball into the back of the net with less than 10 minutes remaining in the first half. \n\"We executed our pieces and took what was there,\" Gibson said. \"We were able to outplay the weather and some calls that went against us. You have to credit our kids for staying focused.\" \nDailey got loose again about nine minutes into the second half, hitting a goal from a tough angle past Fowkes for a 4-0 lead. \nKevin Herrmann put the Crusaders on the board, converting a penalty kick at the 15:42 mark, but three minutes, Michael Gibson hit a pass across the box, and Dailey finished to cap his hat trick and the scoring. \nRosecrans keeper Keagen McLaughlin finished with two saves, while Fowkes made 13 stops in the losing effort. \nbhannahs@zanesvilletimesrecorder.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:08:36.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
