It was actually quite a miracle.” \nWhincup confirmed the story, saying: “Yeah, I remember we said: ‘We can do this’ (before leaving Bathurst).” \nDumbrell said they even considered posting their rent-a-car fuel dilemma on social media before leaving Bathurst. \nThen they considered their fuming team boss Roland Dane who sensationally publicly blamed Whincup for the 2014 Bathurst fuel debacle. \n“We were about to put a photo on social media about this predicament we were in but we thought ‘probably a bit too soon’,” Dumbrell laughed. \nSix-time V8 champion Whincup will be out to ensure his 2015 championship campaign doesn’t run out of gas at Bathurst. \nWhincup arrives at the 55th Bathurst 1000 on 1586 points with five crunch rounds left, well behind Ford pace setter and arch rival Mark Winterbottom (2215pts). \nWinterbottom’s Prodrive Racing team are vying for a third straight Bathurst 1000 triumph. \nWinterbottom held out Whincup to emerge triumphant in 2013 while the Holden star’s fuel gaffe helped Prodrive Racing’s Chaz Mostert seal a stunning last-to-first 2014 win. \nPractice for the Bathurst 1000 begins from 1115 AEDT on Thursday. \nThe Great Race is on Sunday.
