The right-hander is expected to be ready for the start of spring training, according to the Yankees.\nIn its statement, the club acknowledged that Tanaka’s bone spur was a pre-existing condition dating to his career in Japan.\nLeft unsaid was how much that condition affected his 2015 season and what impact it has on 2016; the Yankees are currently holding organizational meetings, mapping the course of potential trades and free-agent signings for next season.\nTanaka, Michael Pineda (forearm strain), Nathan Eovaldi (elbow tendinitis), CC Sabathia (knee inflammation) and Ivan Nova (recovery from Tommy John surgery) all spent time on the disabled list in 2015.\nAll five starters are due to return in 2016, with Tanaka as the staff’s ace.\nTuesday’s procedure was performed at Manhattan’s Hospital for Special Surgery by Dr. David Altchek and went “as expected” in the statement released by the club.\nAccording to the Yankees, the typical recovery time for such surgery includes six weeks of exercise and strengthening followed by a throwing program.\nBut this is the third occurrence of arm problems for Tanaka, who has five years remaining on a seven-year, $155 million contract.\nEarlier this season, Tanaka – who turns 27 on Nov. 1 – went on the DL from April 24 through June 2 due to a mild right forearm strain and right wrist tendinitis.\nAnd in 2014, Tanaka suffered a small tear to his right elbow ligament and missed over two months.\nThe injury carried with it the possibility of Tommy John surgery but three specialists recommended rehab and Tanaka recovered to make two starts before the end of the 2014 season.\nThis year, Tanaka went 12-7 in 24 starts with a 3.51 ERA. He started and lost the AL wild-card game, a 3-0 Houston Astros win at Yankee Stadium.\nBut he has not approached the dynamic start to his rookie MLB season. Over his first 14 starts in 2014, Tanaka went 11-1 with a 1.99 ERA.\nSince then, Tanaka is 14-11 with a 3.78 ERA in 30 starts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:24:22.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
