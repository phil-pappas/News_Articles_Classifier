Senior cornerback Terrell Chestnut is day-to-day with a shoulder injury after getting knocked out of the Baylor game. Meanwhile, junior running back Wendell Smallwood needs time to get back up to speed after missing a ton of practice reps. The David Sills move to wide receiver is permanent and yet at the same time temporary. After reeling in two passes and a touchdown Saturday against Baylor, Sills has moved into a starting spot. His move back to taking quarterback reps in practice will wait until the offseason. Dana Holgorsen believes West Virginia's offense could have been more explosive in Waco if they were able to connect on some more shots downfield.
