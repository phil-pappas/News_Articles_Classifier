CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nROCKAWAY Darryl Strawberry is one of the most beloved figures in recent New York baseball history, having won World Series titles for both the Yankees and the Mets. \nBut despite the hundreds of fans who showed up wearing ball caps and jerseys Wednesday night at Morris Knolls High School, Strawberry, 53, wasn’t there to discuss his days on the diamond. \n“I don’t follow the Dodgers, Yankees, Mets,” Strawberry said when asked who he was rooting for in the playoffs. “I don’t care, I don’t watch. But I wish them all the best.” \nLes Wexler, president of the Rockaway Township Substance Abuse Alliance, typically runs a year-long anti-drug program at Copeland Middle School, but said he wanted Strawberry to speak to high school students and the general public as well. \n“Darryl Strawberry can provide real attention to this issue,” Wexler said. “There’s just something about him that allows him to spread the message of the night.” \nWexler introduced Strawberry, and discussed the issue of drug addiction in New Jersey. \n“We have a very serious problem in our community, in our state, in our country,” Wexler said. “We have an epidemic. Heroin is killing people.” \nStrawberry said it’s important he talks about substance abuse with kids in addition to adults. \n“Kids are important and they’re clearly not getting the message. Drugs are dangerous and this is a major issue that we’re dealing with. People think it’s not in their town but it needs to be talked about,” Strawberry said. “The message is stop looking the other way. Kids are experimenting early and it’s in the community.” \nStrawberry let attendees know right away what he came to Rockaway to discuss. \n“Let’s just get this out of the way,” he said. “Got any Mets fans here?” \nLoud cheers. \n“How about Yankees fans?” \nLouder cheers. \n“Unfortunately, I don’t like baseball anymore,” he said. “It’s just one of those things.” \nInstead, Strawberry discussed the drug epidemic affecting our country, particularly young adults in New Jersey. \n“It’s about educating young people, and you adults as parents about drug addiction,” Strawberry said. “What I’m seeing with these young people breaks my heart. We’re losing these kids to addiction like never before.” \nDespite not discussing his Rookie of the Year award, his eight All-Star appearances, or his four World Series rings, Strawberry commanded the room. He had plenty to say without talking baseball. He’s seen some of life’s highest highs and lowest lows. \nStrawberry spent time in prison and was in an out of rehab facilities, where he said he couldn’t get the help he needed because he was looked at as a celebrity. But he is also a cancer survivor, author, ordained minister, and runs three rehab facilities and the Darryl Strawberry Foundation to help children with autism. \nStrawberry started at the beginning of his story, discussing growing up with an abusive, alcoholic father, and how addiction is a generational problem. \n“Those of you too young to know about what I did, Google it,” Strawberry said. “I was smoking marijuana at 12 and drinking at 13. I already had issues before I put on a uniform. My uniform covered the scars and I was great because of my pain. But my pain almost led me to my grave.” \nHe talked about going through his struggles with addiction in the public eye. \n“I had a lot of stuff but I had nothing inside. Money just buys you more stuff,” Strawberry said. “I’d be out until 6 a.m. and then go play the next day. Took amphetamines at the ball park and go hit the fastball.” \nStrawberry said he went through two marriages and six children “like a tornado.” In his 1983 rookie year, he said veterans welcomed him to the big leagues with a cocaine. \n“I became an alcoholic at 21 and an addict at 22. I liked it. It made me feel like I didn’t have to think,” Strawberry said. “My pain made me great. But my life, my addiction, drove me to the pit. I could play baseball but who was I really?” \nStrawberry said he eventually had a spiritual awakening, “got well inside,” and found purpose. \n“I was jailed, institutionalized, but I didn’t die. I lost everything. I lost my life, but then I gained my life,” Strawberry said. “It doesn’t matter what roadmaps a person takes, there’s a roadmap to get well. I think the reason I’m here is to give hope.” \nStrawberry spoke to the more than 1,100 people who packed the auditorium from schools county-wide, members of the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office, and many people still in recovery including current members in recovery at Morristown’s Market Street Mission, who came to the speech on a field trip. \nStrawberry appealed to the audience to reach out and help those struggling with addiction. \n“Some of us here tonight need to stop being selfish. And you need to get up and help someone,” Strawberry said. “This is your community, I’m leaving tomorrow. You need to get with it. Tonight, me coming here, is a call to action.” \nStrawberry ended his discussion by opening the floor to questions. Many came up to thank him as former addicts now in recovery. Some did ask him about his time playing in the major leagues. \nStrawberry said he doesn’t keep in touch with any athletes from his playing days, but he did comment on Yankee C.C. Sabathia recently entering treatment for alcohol addiction. \n“I applaud him,” Strawberry said. “Baseball will pass, but he’s thinking about his wife and his family.” \nStrawberry ended his discussion by speaking directly to the Market Street Mission attendees. \n“You’re going through this program, but this program is not your life. It’s not your entire life,” Strawberry said. “No matter how hard it is, you’re in a program and not in a graveyard.” \nGo to http://rtsaa.org/ to learn more about the Rockaway Township Substance Abuse Alliance. \nStaff Writer Michael Izzo: 973-428-6636; mizzo@GannettNJ.com Read or Share this story: http://dailyre.co/1RL25ti TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:38:35.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
