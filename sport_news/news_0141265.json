The strategy failed miserably, as Carroo caught seven passes for 134 yards and three touchdowns. But Carroo's triumphant return was dampened by a late touchdown drive that gave the Spartans a 31-24 win at High Point Solutions Stadium . \n\"At the end of the day, they're Michigan State and they have a lot of confidence in how they play the game so I wasn't surprised that they gave me 1-on-1 coverage, especially being that they gave me 1-on-1 coverage all game last year,\" Carroo said. \"I just knew I had to play with better technique than my opponent did.\" \nCarroo's technique showed no rust after a suspension that spanned 25 days following his arrest for simple assault stemming from an altercation after Rutgers' loss to Washington State on Sept. 12. The charge against Carroo was dismissed on Tuesday and he was reinstated to the team by coach Kyle Flood on Wednesday afternoon. \nNorries Wilson, who served as the interim coach on game days during Flood's three game suspension that ended on Saturday, said he didn't know what to expect from Carroo after such a lengthy layoff. It didn't take long for Carroo to show that he hadn't lost a step. \nCarroo started the game and caught the first pass thrown his way for a 5-yard touchdown on the opening play of the second quarter to tie the score at 7. The first-team All-Big Ten receiver was only warming up. \nOn Rutgers' next possession, Carroo burned a Michigan State corner off the line and hauled in an easy 39-yard touchdown pass from Chris Laviano to put the Scarlet Knights ahead, 14-7. Carroo capped his night with a 28-yard touchdown catch late in the third quarter that pulled Rutgers to within 24-21. \n\"The bottom line is I'm a competitor so I was going to go out there and play as hard as I can no matter what the situation was,\" Carroo said. \"No matter what game I came back, I was going to approach the game the same exact way. That's exactly what I did (Saturday) night.\" \nRELATED: What did Plaxico Burress say to Leonte Carroo postgame? \nCarroo had an opportunity to put Rutgers ahead late in the fourth quarter, but a back-shoulder fade from Laviano was broken up in the end zone by Michigan State cornerback Arjen Colquhoun. The Knights settled for a tying field goal before MSU scored the game-winning touchdown on the ensuing possession. \n\"It's a football game,\" Carroo said. \"I made a bunch of great plays (Saturday) night and he made his great play. He did a good job playing it and he deflected the pass.\" \nMichigan State held Carroo to one catch for six yards in a 45-3 blowout last season . Carroo said he wasn't motivated by payback, but he had no shortage of emotion in his return to the field. \n\"I was very excited to get out there and play today for my team,\" Carroo said. \"It was unfortunate that we lost, but I just was very excited all day. I had a lot of momentum going into this game.\" \nCarroo's singular dominance caught the attention for former Giants receiver Plaxico Burress. The former Michigan State star was on the Spartans' sideline and he told Carroo \"that was one the best performances that I've seen in person.\" \nCarroo has 14 catches for 315 yards and six touchdowns in just 2-1/2 games this season, as he also missed the first half of the opener due to a suspension for violating curfew in training camp . The program's all-time leader in touchdown receptions, Carroo is averaging a TD on every 3.9 catches for his career. \n\"Most importantly, I was just excited to get out there for my teammates,\" Carroo said. \"I'm a captain and I know at the end of the day that they want me out there. They were excited that I was back and I was going to do anything I could to perform at a high level for them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:20:57.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
