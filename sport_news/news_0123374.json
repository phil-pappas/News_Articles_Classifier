Kickoff is 7 p.m. Saturday in Waverider Stadium. \n“This matches with the adversity we’ve been feeling,” said senior offensive lineman Seth Fukushima. “It feels right.” \nInterim coach/defensive coordinator/police officer Kaeo Drummondo agrees, even though he was set to work Saturday morning until 7:30 a.m. and faced the prospect of getting little sleep before the team bus leaves for West Hawaii at 1:30 p.m. \n“For whatever odd reason, how our season has shaped out,” Drummondo said, “it does make sense to me that now we have to get on that bus, travel three hours and block out all the distractions, put all the adversity on the side. \n“The opportunity to win BIIFs is right there. We have to go out there and grasp it.” \nThe Waveriders (7-1 BIIF, 8-3) grabbed home-field advantage Oct. 2 with a 30-29 double-overtime victory against the Vikings (6-2, 6-4) at Wong Stadium. That’s the Vikings only loss in their past six games. \n“They definitely played us better than last year,” Fukushima said. “We really had to step up more and compete at their level.” \nOf the five meetings between the teams the past two seasons, the only blowout was Hilo’s 32-0 victory against the turnover-prone Waveriders in the 2014 title game at Wong. \nDrummondo doesn’t foresee a repeat. \n“We know what to expect, they know what to expect,” he said. “They’re a challenging opponent for us, and every time we play its always a physical, exciting game. I wouldn’t expect anything different (Saturday).” \nHilo features a swarming defense, but Drummondo has come to rue numerous breakdowns that have lead to big plays. Anthony Trevino and Riggs Kurashige each got behind the Vikings’ defense for long touchdown receptions from Markus Degrate in the earlier victory. \nAnother issue for Hilo was a running game that failed to generate 80 yards against the Waveriders’ physical front. Fukushima pointed to correctable mistakes for the lack of production. \n“Not enough execution” Drummondo said. “We do expect more out of the offensive line, and I think they’ll be up for the challenge. Regardless of how we do it, we have to manufacture a running game.” \nIf so, Hilo’s offensive balance could be daunting. \nThe Vikings appeared to be on the verge of taking over in the first half in the first meeting against the Waveriders before a costly interception late in the second quarter. Junior quarterback Ka’ale Tiogangco sat out the first half, but he’s been efficient all season in getting the ball to an array of Hilo playmakers. \nKalei Tolentino-Perry’s return from injury in a 35-0 victory against Waiakea in the BIIF semifinals gave Hilo another key cog in the passing game and boosted the special teams. \n“Of the four years I’ve been here, this is the most crisp passing game we’ve had,” Drummondo said. \nIn a sense, he’s happy Hilo has to hit the road to secure a threepeat. When the Vikings get on the bus, Drummondo will be able to make sure their all on board, physically and mentally. \n“It’s going to come down to who wants it more and minimizing turnovers,” Fukushima said.
