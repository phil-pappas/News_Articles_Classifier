The three straight shutouts to open a season are the most since a school-record four straight to open the 1935 season.\nBut now they face a Capital team that averages 36.7 points per game and 461 yards per game of total offense. It helps the Crusaders that they return nine starters on offense in their triple-option attack.\nCapital averages 6.5 yards per rush. Brent Walton leads the OAC in rushing yards (172 per game) and rushing touchdowns (9). Sophomore slot Cory Heeter averages 7.9 yards per carry. Quarterback Nick Iske completes 54 percent of his passes.\nBut history is on Mount Union's side. The Raiders have won 29 straight against Capital. The Crusaders have not defeated the Raiders since 1987.\nOnline coverage: Live Stats, LIVE WDPN Audio, LIVE WRMU Audio.\nJohn Carroll (3-0) will play its first home game of the season at 1:30 p.m. Saturday against Ohio Northern (2-1). Watch the live feed here. John Carroll is coming off a victory against Baldwin Wallace in last week's Cuyahoga Gold Bowl. Ohio Northern defeated Heidelberg.\nPunter Kyle Rodriguez became the second John Carroll player in consecutive weeks to earn the OAC Special Teams Player of the Week.
