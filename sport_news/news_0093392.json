Court documents state that the Bengals started paying more in 2014 and that the team denies any wrongdoing but decided to settle the lawsuit to avoid lengthy, expensive litigation.\nThe settlement is subject to a Dec. 3 fairness hearing, and the Bengals can cancel the deal if cheerleaders with a combination of six years or more opt out. For example, if two cheerleaders who each worked three seasons refuse it - or six who each cheered one year - the Bengals have the right to withdraw.\nFormer cheerleader Alexa Brenneman would receive an extra $5,000 from the Bengals as the lead plaintiff in the legal action. An attorney for her declined comment Wednesday, and a Bengals spokesman said the team had no comment on the case.\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown this year signed legislation recognizing professional cheerleaders in the state as employees who are entitled to minimum wage, overtime and other labor protections. Dozens of Oakland Raiders cheerleaders had settled a lawsuit with that NFL team after claiming they were paid less than $5 an hour when rehearsal time and public appearances were included.\nA former Milwaukee Bucks cheerleader recently sued the NBA team, saying she received far less than minimum wage of $7.25 an hour for games, practices, team functions and photo shoots. The team said it believed the lawsuit was without merit and will contest it.\n___\nContact the reporter at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
