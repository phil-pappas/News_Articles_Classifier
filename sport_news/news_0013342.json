The decision to bid for the contract had been criticised by lawmakers and human rights groups.\nThe withdrawal was consistent with plans to wind down the activities of the commercial entity, the spokeswoman said, adding that it was unrelated to the Andree case.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:54:17.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
