With kickers Jorge Powell and Austin Hardin battling injury, the team took to Twitter seeking walk-ons to try out for the Gators. \nPowell replaced starter Austin Hardin four games ago but was injured while covering a kickoff Saturday night at LSU. After not travelling to Kentucky or Missouri, Hardin made the trip to Baton Rouge. But during warm-ups was clearly uncomfortable as he repeatedly stretched his right leg and hip and walked gingerly. \nNeither Florida kicker has been reliable. The Gators have missed four of their past six field-goal attempts - 34 (twice), 35 and 36 yards. Three of those misses are by Hardin. \nPowell also missed an extra point Oct. 3 against Ole Miss and sent a kickoff out of bounds Oct. 10 at Missouri. \nPowell's best moment as Florida's kicker was his tackle of Tennessee returner Evan Berry as he was breaking free up the sideline. \nCoach Jim McElwain lost faith in his kicking game to point he passed a 40-yard field-goal attempt at Missouri to try a fake. Punter Johnny Townsend was tackled for a three-yard loss. \nMeanwhile, Georgia senior Marshall Morgan of Fort Lauderdale is struggling. Considered one of the SEC's top kickers entering the season, Morgan has missed four of 13 attempts this season. \nMorgan did make three field goals, including a 34-yard game-winner, during this past week's 9-6 against Missouri. But four minutes prior to the game-winner he missed from 26 yards. \nOne option for the Gators is Brooks Abbott, who spent last season with the team after he transferred from Virginia Tech. \nUpon seeing Florida's need for a kicker, Abbott tweeted, \"Maybe time to lace them back up.\" A little later, he confirmed on Twitter he would try out Wednesday. \nEmail Edgar Thompson at egthompson@orlandosentinel.com .
