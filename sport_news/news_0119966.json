But the early signs aren't promising. \n\"We don't know that yet,\" Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said of Carroo's status on the Big Ten coaches' conference call on Tuesday afternoon. \"We'll have an update a little later in the week. He didn't practice today.\" \nRutgers will hold three more practice sessions before Saturday's showdown with the top-ranked Buckeyes at High Point Solution Stadium (8 p.m., ABC). \nCarroo left Saturday's 55-52 win over Indiana with an ankle injury late in the third quarter. With his foot in a walking boot after the game, Carroo said he would \"definitely\" play against Ohio State . But Carroo, who has 21 catches for 472 yards and nine touchdowns this season, is listed as questionable on the injury report Flood released on Monday . \nIf Carroo can't play, Carlton Agudosi again would step into his role . Agudosi has 12 catches for 180 yards and a touchdown this season, including three catches for 72 yards in the fourth quarter against Indiana. \n\"Nothing changes about our offense when Carlton goes in the game,\" Flood said. \"I think you saw that late in the game last week. Leonte goes down at the end of the third quarter and Carlton comes in and plays the rest of the game and makes some big plays, an explosive play to help us on the last drive, a third-down catch. So I'm proud of him. I'm proud of how hard he's worked. I think it's a testament to how mentally tough he is to be able to do it and we've got high expectations for him when he's out there.\" \nRELATED: Analyzing Rutgers' injury reports \nIn addition to Carroo, wide receiver Janarion Grant is also listed as questionable with a lower body injury. Grant has 18 catches for 170 yards, but his biggest impact comes on special teams. The shifty junior has three return touchdowns this season. \nFlood said he hasn't decided yet who would take Grant's spot as the punt returner if he can't play. Running backs Josh Hicks and Robert Martin are the top options to take Grant's place on kickoff returns. Hicks averaged 18 yards on nine kickoff returns last season. Martin hasn't returned a kick in his two-year career. \n\"Those are guys we've worked back there,\" Flood said. \"I remember going to see Josh Hicks when we were recruiting him down at Palmetto (Fla.) and he ripped off a kickoff return for a touchdown in the game that I was watching. Even though he hasn't had a chance yet to do it in a game, I've got a lot of confidence in him. But the punt returner we have not made a decision on yet.\" \nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21 .
