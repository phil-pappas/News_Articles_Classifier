He faces up to seven years in prison.\nPolice pulled Dion over for speeding in Junction City, Kansas, in 2013 and searched his pickup truck, finding nearly $850,000. Investigators later found $2 million in a bank account, $880,000 in an Arizona building and nearly 400 pounds of marijuana and $11 million at a storage facility in North Reading, Massachusetts.\nProsecutors said Dion sold about 6,600 to 22,000 pounds of marijuana dating back to 1992.\nDion maintains police searched his truck unconstitutionally and is appealing. His lawyer says he is embracing his responsibility.\n———\nInformation from: The Boston Globe, http://www.bostonglobe.com\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1MGmnE6"], "published": "2015-10-16T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:06:26.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
