Just trying to get everything on paper and final.\" \nThe big stir came Monday afternoon when the AFL released this statement: \nThe Arena Football League has been in discussions with the Spokane Shock about allowing them to continue using the Shock name and trademarks. The rights to all Spokane Shock trademarks and logos are owned by the AFL and there have been earnest attempts to reach an agreement for the acquisition of those marks. Unfortunately, those attempts have not come to fruition and the League will retain the rights to the Spokane Shock name. The League intends to have a presence in the State of Washington again in the near future. \nThe organization told KREM2 the ownership group had a conference call with the league office shortly after that statement was released to get more information and clarity on the matter. The team was a bit surprised by the league's statement, but all issues seem to be figured out. \nThe first game in the IFL kicks off on February 27 at Spokane Arena. Expect the Tri-Cities Fever to take on the Spokane Shock.
