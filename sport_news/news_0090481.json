Jackson has not played since the season opener on Sept. 13 because of a nagging hamstring injury. He has no catches this season.\n“He’ll get to the bottom of it, as will the police, and we’ll go from there,” Washington head coach Jay Gruden said Friday morning.\nIn an interview with ESPN The Magazine last year, Jackson admitted that he still associated with people in gangs that he knew from his youth, but that he was not in, nor ever had been, in a gang.\nContributing: A.J.
