The Wolverines entered Friday night’s game with the Gunnison Cowboys undefeated, ranked No. 2 by the Colorado High School Athletic Association and sitting on top of the 5A Western Slope (South) League standings. Bayfield sophomore Taed Heydinger caught a touchdown pass and threw a touchdown pass on the night. Heydinger’s touchdown catch came from senior Kelton McCoy, who also threw two touchdown passes. Heydinger then threw a scoring pass to senior Wyatt Freier, both scores came in the second quarter. McCoy also hooked up with Freier in the third quarter for a touchdown pitch and catch. BHS senior running back Zane Phelps was not to be denied, either, as he scored in the second quarter. “Generally I think our offense went in spurts,” Bayfield head coach Gary Heide said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “We had some good passing plays; Kelton (McCoy) threw the ball really well (Friday night).” The stifling Bayfield defense allowed only one scoring drive, spoiling Gunnison’s homecoming night. Bayfield (5-0, 2-0) remains undefeated, and Gunnison (3-3, 1-1) will surely fall from its top-10 ranking. “I’m really proud of how the guys came here with a lot on the line and played really hard and really tough,” Heide said. With the win, the Wolverines are tied with Alamosa for first place in the Western Slope (South) league. Those two teams will meet in two weeks at Wolverine Country Stadium in Bayfield. “I’ve heard a lot of good things about Alamosa,” Heide said. “This win is a step in the right direction. This doesn’t wrap up leauge, however.” Bayfield will switch its attention to the road game it has with Montezuma-Cortez (2-4, 1-1) next week at 7 p.m. on Friday night at Montezume-Cortez High School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:19:20.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
