Inaugurating a global conference on Unani medicine at the Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre (SKICC) here, the Chief Minister said both homeopathy and allopathy take different trajectories to achieve the same goal of curing people. The two-day conference organised by the Directorate of Indian System of Medicine has attracted a large number of delegates from all over the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates. The meet was earlier scheduled last year, but could not be held due to the September floods. Referring to the predilection of people for taking medicines for “instant results” in a fast-moving world, Mufti Sayeed said efficacy of homeopathy as a time-tested system, which still has a wide acceptance among masses in our country. “The Health Department will have to travel an extra mile to promote Unani medicine in times when its mainstream counterparts like allopathy are making huge strides and gaining popularity,” he said while identifying alternate system of medicine as one of the key components of AYUSH.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:09:49.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
