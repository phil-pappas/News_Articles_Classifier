On the day that Burns' story first appeared in USA Today, Burns discussed his decision to come out with The Journal's Bill Reynolds. He said he knew he was gay at age 13. But as an athlete in a small New Hampshire town, he was coming of age in a time when very few people talked about such issues, least of all athletes. \"The people that have come before me, and the people that will come after me,\" Burns said. \"That's why it's important. And I've waited 31 years for it.\" Check back later for Reynolds' full column on Burns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:55:24.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
