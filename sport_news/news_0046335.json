In 1993, the Blue Jays won their second consecutive World Series to establish a mini-dynasty, and Basque was an infant in St. John, New Brunswick. Over the next 22 years a playoff drought settled over Canada that was so unyielding that Blue Jays fans had little concept of what it was like to see playoff baseball in October. So when the Blue Jays finally surged back to the postseason this year, nothing would stop Basque from attending the first two games. Not the cost. Not even a pregnant girlfriend. “She is 30 weeks pregnant, but I was not going to miss this,” Basque said Wednesday outside the Air Canada Centre. “She’s really ticked off at me, but I had to come.” Basque, a 23-year-old firefighter, and his 28-year-old friend Lloyd Burnisde, a welder, spent roughly $1,100 each on tickets from an online outlet (plus airfare from St. John) for the first two games of the American League division series against the Texas Rangers. They also bought tickets to the Toronto Maple Leafs season-opening game against the Montreal Canadiens on Wednesday night to complete the perfect junket.

To prove the point, a group of Blue Jays players received an enormous ovation when they were spotted at the Maple Leafs game. “That’s how you know,” Blue Jays pitcher R. A. Dickey said. “It’s opening night for the Leafs, it’s a hockey town, and everybody is talking about the Blue Jays. I was getting gas the other night and this guy comes over and he is beside himself how happy he is. He was bringing up ’92 and ’93 and saying we’re the greatest.” This team is a long way from the 1992-93 powerhouses that made the Blue Jays the envy of baseball. But they have been dubbed the favorites to win the 2015 World Series. That quest starts Thursday when David Price throws the first pitch in the Rogers Centre, the same building where, in 1993, Joe Carter hit his World Series-winning, ninth-inning home run. Then it was known as SkyDome, and that home run was the last play in Blue Jays postseason history. In uniform that night was Al Leiter, the broadcaster and former pitcher who played for the Blue Jays from 1989 until 1995. He said the early ’90s were heady days in Toronto, great times to be a Blue Jay, with huge turnouts. In 1992, the Blue Jays became the first team to draw four million fans. Leiter has returned to Toronto many times, but it was not until he was there last month with the Yankees for the YES Network that he was transported back 22 years to the delirium of that time. “It was so familiar,” he said. “Same building, same feel, some of the same fans. Electric. What’s happening is people are not just showing up, they are coming early, having a beer, making it a party, and making it a loud party. The atmosphere is just like what it was when I played here.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:48:04.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
