(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) more > By CHARLES ODUM -   \nATLANTA (AP) - With his intended receiver sprawled on the field, it was difficult to tell if Kirk Cousins’ last pass was on target. \nAfter Washington receiver Ryan Grant slipped, Atlanta’s Robert Alford made the easy interception and returned the ball 59 yards for a touchdown, lifting the undefeated Falcons to a 25-19 win over the Redskins in overtime Sunday. \nAfter leading most of the game, the Redskins (2-3) were denied their first back-to-back wins in almost a year - since Weeks 7 and 8 in 2014. \n“This is a tough one, man,” said Redskins coach Jay Gruden. “We had an opportunity.” \nPerhaps protecting Grant, Cousins wouldn’t say if his last pass was good. \n“Until I watch the film I can’t say confidently,” Cousins said. “… I can just say I tried to put the ball where I thought it needed to be put.” \nGruden was more forthcoming. \n“Our receiver slips and falls and they get a pick six,” Gruden said. “Ryan Grant just slipped and fell. It’s unfortunate.” \nGrant was not available for postgame interviews. \nCousins completed 21 of 32 passes for 219 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. \n“There’s nowhere to point other than to myself,” Cousins said. “I’ve got to make those throws.” \nWashington’s dismal running game may deserve blame. Matt Jones, who sprained his big toe, had 11 carries for 20 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown run for a 13-12 lead midway through the fourth quarter. Alfred Morris had eight carries for only 15 yards. \nThe Falcons, led by Devonta Freeman’s 153 yards and a touchdown, outrushed the Redskins 176-51. \n“We haven’t been too consistent with our running game the last few weeks,” Morris said. \nThe Redskins had the first possession of OT and Cousins moved the team to midfield. On second and 8 from the 50, Grant slipped while trying to adjust to Cousins’ pass. Alford was in perfect position for the interception before racing down the sideline for the touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:22:47.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
