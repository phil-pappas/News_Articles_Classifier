As the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI are in the “preliminary stage” of an investigation into daily fantasy sports companies, DraftKings and FanDuel, and whether those enterprises comply with federal law, a prominent Florida attorney who has represented many gaming clients said one need look no further than the case against the World Triathlon Corporation (Ironman) to understand the potential impact of a federal inquiry.\nIn May, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida announced that Ironman had agreed to forfeit over $2.7 million in lottery proceeds to the government after the company illegally charged athletes to enter into a lottery for a chance to compete in the Ironman competition in Hawaii.\n“If it was just a state law violation, (the Ironman defendants) would have been looking at maybe 30 days in jail and a fine,” said Marc Dunbar, a partner in the Government Relations Practice Group for the Florida firm, Jones Walker. “Instead, they had to forfeit millions. The federal government has the ability to take away an entire brand.”\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID OR iOS\nAt issue is whether DraftKings and FanDuel — which charge customers an entry fee to draft fantasy sports teams to compete against other customers’ fantasy squads for a chance at big prize money — have violated federal laws in any way. The DOJ and FBI probe, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is looking into the business model of these companies. FBI agents from the Boston field office are also talking with DraftKings customers to inquire about their experiences with the company, according to the Wall Street Journal report.\nDunbar said that once the feds get involved, potential wrongdoers have that much more to fear due to the resources available to prosecutors to build a case.\n“The question is whether these companies are operating legally or illegally. The federal authorities need only find one instance of a violation of a state gambling statute, before they dive into the federal statutes,” said Dunbar. “The federal authorities have greater resources, the federal penalites are stronger. They have witnesses and can develop a deep, fact-based complaint. That is the peril.”\nIn 2006, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was passed to regulate online gambling, but the legislation excluded fantasy sports because they were deemed skill games.\nRelated Stories FBI and Justice Dept. to investigate DraftKings and FanDuel FanDuel and DraftKings have biggest weekend of NFL season Lawsuit alleges insider trading at FanDuel and DraftKings Tags: fantasy sports", "external_links": ["http://nydn.us/app"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:43:06.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
