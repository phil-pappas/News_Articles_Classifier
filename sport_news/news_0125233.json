The Royals and Blue Jays are set for Game 4 of the ALCS in Toronto, first pitch is 4:07 p.m. The Mets and Cubs play Game 3 of the NLCS in Chicago with a scheduled start of 8:07 p.m. Here's a look at what's happening (all times EDT): \n12:45 p.m. \nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons said closer Roberto Osuna and setup man Aaron Sanchez are both ready to pitch despite nagging finger injuries. Osuna has a cracked fingernail and Sanchez a blister. \nBoth right-handers got two outs as Toronto beat the Royals 11-8 Monday night, cutting Kansas City's series lead to 2-1 in the best-of-seven set. Osuna allowed a two-run homer to Kendrys Morales in the ninth. \nGibbons said he would not hesitate to use Osuna and Sanchez three days in a row before the next ALCS off day. \nLeft-hander Brett Cecil, who tore his left calf in Game 2 of the Division Series, is to throw off the mound Tuesday for the second time and hopes to return for the World Series if Toronto advances. \nOutfielder Ben Revere, who jarred his back running the bases Monday, is back in the lineup as the leadoff hitter for Game 4. \n12:39 p.m. \nAbout 3 1-2 hours before Game 4 at Rogers Centre, Kansas City catchers Salvador Perez and Drew Butera did drills at home plate while the grounds crew watched. In the outfield, Blue Jays left fielder Ezequiel Carrera showed off his juggling skills with a soccer ball. He was joined relievers Roberto Osuna and Ryan Tepera. \nAll content copyright Â©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:54:06.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
