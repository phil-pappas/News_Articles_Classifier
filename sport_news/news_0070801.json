It's really odd how the Cats play Mississippi State every year. They're in the west and they've somehow been designated as our rival on the other side. I don't feel any ill will toward Mississippi State but I just don't care about them. \nOver the years when we've gone down there we've actually played them relatively well. We've won two of the last four games in Starkville and we've always seemed to perform better against them than one would think. \nWe will need it this time. A lot of people believe Mississippi State might be the best team left on Kentucky's schedule. Their quarterback Dak Prescott is about as good as they come in the SEC. He can throw and he can run and as you know if you're a UK football fan, that's a combination that often hurts the Cats. \nI think Kentucky has nothing to lose Saturday. There's nobody who expects them to win. As a matter of fact they opened up as an 11.5 underdog, a huge spread. So if Kentucky can even keep it close and have a chance, it will actually be Mississippi State that gets nervous. \nI don't think the Cats are going to win, but like most of the games between the two schools, I do think it'll be close and they'll have a shot. If they could pull off the upset it'll be huge for this program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:11:56.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
