(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) \nWASHINGTON — The Washington Nationals fired manager Matt Williams Monday after two seasons as the team’s skipper, according to multiple sources. \nWilliams presided over a disappointing Nationals team that went just 83-79 despite near-unanimous agreement among prognosticators that they would repeat as National League East division champions following a 96-win campaign in 2014. Williams was named the NL Manager of the Year after that season, his first as a big-league manager. \nThe team’s underachievement was punctuated by the physical confrontation between closer Jonathan Papelbon and star Bryce Harper in the dugout the day after the team was mathematically eliminated, in which the former grabbed the latter by the throat. That incident, combined with reports that Williams had long lost the confidence of the clubhouse, made the news of his release unsurprising, in spite of last season’s accolades. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP.
