Image 38 of 38 Highest paid college football coaches in Texas 1 / 38 Back to Gallery If you needed a reminder that college football — college athletics, in general — has become an arms race, look no further than USA Today's recently released list of FBS college football coaching salaries .\nThe amount of money on display, from No. 1 (Nick Saban, Alabama) to No. 121 (Todd Berry, Lousiana-Monroe), is staggering.\nFour coaches hailing from Texas schools rank among the top 20: Charlie Strong, Kevin Sumlin, Art Briles and Gary Patterson.\nRELATED: Salaries of Greater Houston Area football coaches\nAccording to USA Today sports projects reporter and editor Steve Berkowitz, the number of FBS football head coaches making at least $3 million has near quintupled in the past half-decade, from 7 in 2010 to 34 this season.\nSome of these amounts exceed even what NFL head coaches make. San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Tomsula makes $3.5 million a year; that would place him just 25th among all FBS coaches.\nThe tactical proliferation of FBS programs extends far beyond inflated coaching salaries though, especially among the Power Five conferences.\nTexas A&M just spent over $450 million on renovations to Kyle Field.\nTexas signed a 20-year agreemen t with ESPN for the Longhorn Network in 2011, which nets the university $10,980,000 per year, with an annual increase of three percent.\nOregon's athletic revenue nearly touched $200 million in 2014.\nAuburn spent $126 million last year, despite bringing in just over $113 million.\nAll this in the pursuit of teenagers and, with the unpalatable way recruiting has evolved, preteens.\nIt's a troubling contest which has left the National Collegiate Athletic Association and many of its 128 FBS schools looking less like \"amateur\" organizations and more like professional football teams.\nClick through the slideshow above to see where each coach of a Texas university ranks.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nt witter.com/nrmoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/25/66/8478108/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg",
