The Spartan statue at Michigan State was painted with Michigan colors twice this year. Concerned students stood guard at the Spartan statue this week to make sure a defacing wouldn't occur.\nLast year, a block \"M\" on Michigan's campus was painted green and the letters \"S\" and \"U\" were added.\nSpartans men's basketball coach Tom Izzo wasn't exactly surprised.\n\"First, I've gotta say, that this is rivalry week and you're not supposed to like your opponent,\" Izzo said at Big Ten basketball media day in Chicago. \"There's a lot of great Michigan kids, but there's some idiots. There's some idiots on our side, too, that do crazy things.\n\"Messing with Sparty is a bad thing, like messing with their 'M' is a bad thing. But messing with Magic, that's the worst thing. I'll make sure from now on that maybe the basketball team will sleep (out there).\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Preview:", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;basketball_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Li", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfuzdK.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAeadnv&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Our", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfq1oH.img&quot;}}", "http://www.sportsxchange.com/tsxfiles/topstories", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Michigan", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfqvb0.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAyrb0&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfvmPu.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:11:27.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
