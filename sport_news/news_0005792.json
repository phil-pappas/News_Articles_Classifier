The opportunity is definitely there. It’s good to see that a lot of guys have been able to use that to take the next step.”\nAs his offensive skills blossomed and his two-way game took shape in Buffalo, the next step for Kuhn brought him even closer to home.\nHis friends and teammates started committing to colleges – the majority of them to Canisius.\nBut Kuhn chose rival Niagara.\nA native of Wheatfield, he grew up watching the Purple Eagles play in Dwyer Arena and the Niagara County kid was drawn to Niagara.\nKuhn scored in his first collegiate game – a tally at St. Lawrence – and picked up his first assist the next night at Clarkson.\nHe will put on the Niagara jersey in Dwyer for the first time as the Purple Eagles host Robert Morris for an Atlantic Hockey series Friday and Saturday.\nIn a way, Kuhn and the Purple Eagles grew up together.\nKuhn was born Jan. 19, 1995, in Wheatfield. By that time, the powers that be were preparing to add hockey 10 miles north at Niagara. Hockey there is celebrating its 20th season this year and Kuhn is part of the first generation of Western New York hockey players who grew up with Division I hockey in their own backyard.\n“My dad and I would come to games sometimes when I was younger, and even as I got older we’d come watch and it just felt like our hometown college hockey team,” Kuhn said. Everything here is nice – the facilities, the school, the campus. It just seemed like an easy decision for me.”\nIt was an easy decision for Niagara, too.\nHead coach Dave Burkholder begins his recruiting in Western New York and Southern Ontario and his staff felt Kuhn was the best local player coming out of the region last year. As captain of the Jr. Sabres, he led the team with 27 goals and 23 assists, putting up 50 points in 52 games. But it’s not just his offensive ability that drew attention from college teams. It was his ability to play on all areas of the ice.\n“First of all, he’s so fast so he’s able to close guys down,” Burkholder said. “We’ve actually tried him,” on the “penalty kill and we’re going to try him this week on the power play. We’re going to ease him into that.\n“I think he’s going to be a very reliable person. We have standards of play, or systems that we run, when we don’t have the puck and I think he’ll be reliable. He’s easily coached in that area and then we just let his hockey instincts take over when we do have the puck. He’s pretty dynamic. He can make plays.”\nemail: amoritz@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:32:20.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
