The Americans are 3-4-0-0 on the season with a 1-0 lead in the 10-game season series with Syracuse.\nCrunch goaltender Adam Wilcox made 37 saves on 40 shots in his third start of the season. Americans goaltender Andrey Makarov turned aside 30 of 33. Syracuse was unable to convert on five power play opportunities, while Rochester struck on 2-of-6 man-advantages.\nThe Americans were first on the board at the 8:41 mark of the first period. While on the power play, Matt Donovan fired a shot on goal that was turned away. Phil Varone chased down the rebound behind the net and banked it off Wilcox to put Rochester up 1-0.\nThe Crunch responded just 49 seconds into the middle frame. Luke Witkowski drove to the net and tried to slam the puck home, but was stopped. Yanni Gourde was in the perfect position to pick up the rebound in the slot and chip it over Makarov's outstretched leg to knot the score, 1-1. Slater Koekkoek recorded the secondary assist.\nIt only took the Americans 1:26 to take back the lead. Jerome Leduc skated the puck into the zone on the right wing side. He passed down to Cal O'Reilly at the left goal post. A quick cross-crease pass set Nick Baptiste up to net the go-ahead score.\nWith 4:38 remaining in the second, Syracuse's Mike Blunden evened the score at 2-2. Jonathan Marchessault started a rush when he stripped the puck in the defensive zone. Blunden received his pass, got around the defense and scored the equalizer top shelf with the forehand. Jeff Tambellini grabbed a point with the secondary helper.\nThe Americans took the lead for the third time at the 4:57 mark of the final period. While on a 5-on-3 power play, O'Reilly fed it down to Varone in the right corner. Wilcox went down on his cross-crease pass and allowed Jason Akeson to light the lamp from the left goal post.\nThe Crunch's Anthony DeAngelo recorded his first pro goal six minutes later and tied the game 3-3. DeAngelo controlled the puck down low and ripped a wrist shot just under the cross bar. Mike Angelidis and Henri Ikonen assisted on the rookie's tally.\nThe teams remained tied through regulation and the overtime period and required a shootout. Varone and Akeson scored in the shootout while Marchessault and Tambellini were denied for the Crunch.\nSyracuse travels to Toronto to face the Marlies at 7 p.m. on Wednesday.\n— Boxscore\n— AHL standings", "external_links": ["http://theahl.com/stats/statdisplay.php?type=standings", "http://theahl.com/stats/game-summary.php?game_id=1014780"], "published": "2015-10-26T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:46:17.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
