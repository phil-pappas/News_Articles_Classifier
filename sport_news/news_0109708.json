(Photo: Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Anointing “trade deadline winners and losers” in the aftermath of baseball’s July 31 transactions bazaar is usually a meaningless exercise, in that true assessments can’t be made for months, if not years.\nFor a handful of teams that went all-in on 2015, however, judgment day has arrived in the form of Friday’s quadruple-header of Division Series games.\nWhether playing for their lives or going for the kill, July’s big movers will be at the forefront.\n“That's exactly why we got Johnny Cueto,” Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost said after his club dropped Game 1 of their ALDS to the Houston Astros. “You lose Game 1, you got Johnny Cueto. That's why we got Johnny - for games like that.”\nFriday features four “games like that.” A look at the trade gems like Cueto who may need to justify their team’s investments:\n***\nTexas Rangers at Toronto Blue Jays, 12:30 p.m. ET (MLB Network): Even the Rangers admit they had little expectation acquiring Cole Hamels would boost them to these playoffs. But it happened – thanks in large part to Hamels’ 7-1 mark in 12 starts, with the Rangers winning the last 10 of them. The Rangers’ investment in Hamels was extensive – five decent prospects and assuming at least $76 million in salary.\nThe biggest payoff in that investment certainly was for situations like Game 2 in Toronto: The chance to take a commanding lead against one of baseball’s most imposing lineup in several years. Hamels figures to make at least 100 starts with the Rangers, but some will be bigger than others. That this one comes so surprisingly soon doesn’t diminish its import.\nUSA TODAY\nAce beaten, stars ailing: Are Blue Jays in deep in ALDS vs. Rangers?\nOn the Blue Jays’ side? Well, after David Price came up small and Josh Donaldson suffered a head injury in Game 1, the Blue Jays need a boost in Game 2. Hey, how about Troy Tulowitzki? He went 0 for 4 in Game 1, and batted .239 since his July arrival from Colorado. He’s one of at least five premier right-handed batters the Blue Jays will stack against Hamels. With Donaldson and Jose Bautista possibly ailing, Toronto could use some punch from Tulo.\n***\nHouston Astros at Kansas City Royals, 3:30 p.m. ET (Fox Sports 1): Along with the Blue Jays, the Royals generally “won” the trade deadline thanks to their acquisitions of Cueto and second baseman Ben Zobrist. Now, after a listless performance in Game 1, they have no choice but hope that the biggest midseason trade acquisition in franchise history bails them out.\nRecent indicators, as you might have heard, aren’t encouraging. Cueto posted a 4.76 ERA with the Royals after his July arrival from Cincinnati, with a grim 11.2 hits per nine innings. He was slightly better in his final four starts, but still far from the guy who posted a 1.17 WHIP over eight seasons with the Reds. He’ll walk into free agency after this year, and anything less than a dominant outing Fridaywill make his Kansas City fling a colossal failure. After all, Cy Young Award favorite Dallas Keuchel awaits in Game 3 in Houston.\nThe Astros, meanwhile, may piggyback a pair of July prizes to win Game 2. Scott Kazmir was acquired from Oakland to help the Astros turn on the afterburners in the AL West. Instead, like Cueto, faded badly the last two months of the season, a key reason for the Astros’ free fall into second place. Should he falter, the Astros could turn quickly to Mike Fiers, considered the lesser light in a deal that brought Carlos Gomez to Houston. But Fiers threw a no-hitter in August, and could be summoned in relief if Kazmir wobbles.\nUSA TODAY\nA.J. Hinch's hunch pays off, Astros take Game 1 of ALDS vs. Royals\n***\nChicago Cubs at St. Louis Cardinals, 6:30 p.m. ET (TBS): OK, so neither team did much of significance at the deadline. So let’s pause to note that some of the greatest deadline deals are the ones that receive little fanfare. John Lackey’s July 2014 arrival in St. Louis was overshadowed by blockbusters around the majors involving Price and others. You’d be hard-pressed, though, to find a pitcher delivering more value than Lackey in the last year-plus. This season, pitching for the major league minimum $507,500 due to a clause in his contract from Boston, he was the Cardinals’ steadiest starter, logging a 2.77 ERA over 218 innings, producing 26 quality starts and pitching at least seven innings 21 times.\nHe’ll get the ball in Game 1, which represents something of a must-win for St. Louis with the indomitable Jake Arrieta lurking in Game 3.\n***\nYoenis Cespedes has a strong postseason track record in two seasons with Oakland. (Photo: Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports)\nNew York Mets at Los Angeles Dodgers, 9:45 p.m. ET (TBS): Yoenis Cespedes could take all of October off, and still he’d be worth the price of two solid pitching prospects the Mets sent to Detroit. After all, his 17 home runs in 57 games – that still doesn’t look right – boosted the Mets into the playoffs for the first time since 2006.\nStill, now that they’re here, the Mets will be in desperate need of offense. That’s OK – Cespy’s probably got this. In two postseasons with Oakland, Cespedes had a .350/.395/.525 slash line. In 2013, when Detroit’s Max Scherzer was the best pitcher on the planet, Cespedes was the lone Athletic to dent him – ripping a two-run homer. He went 5 for 11 in games started by Scherzer and Justin Verlander.\nWhy is this relevant? Well, the Mets will face almost exclusively great pitchers in this Division Series, starting with left-hander Clayton Kershaw in Game 1. And they need Cespedes to be great.\nUSA TODAY\nYoenis Cespedes not afraid of Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke\n1 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2979b68763924d19afacb67c44a40def21c07ded/c=0-0-2887-2887/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799424874486495-USATSI-8849226.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b1933a5a53bbf6bc9a16a77219b67ac5c50e2f23/c=981-894-2578-3023&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799501914887774-USP-MLB-ALDS-Houston-Astros-at-Kansas-City-Royals.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799501914887774-USP-MLB-ALDS-Houston-Astros-at-Kansas-City-Royals.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RxcGbe&text=It%27s%20judgment%20day%20for%20for%20MLB%27s%20deadline%20jewels&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/321d5cb1c31337e0e96e4599977cf520a1f272c8/c=503-0-2897-2394/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799338256654153-USATSI-8849108.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RxcGbe&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0b8ebdf6865f7a1fa7bfdbe171724fc38f0e288/c=43-0-3227-2394&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799505271582808-USP-MLB-NLDS-New-York-Mets-at-Los-Angeles-Dodgers.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f134d1d239959ada60263fdead1c5c5fab33ef2/r=293x400/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799501914887774-USP-MLB-ALDS-Houston-Astros-at-Kansas-City-Royals.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7aa382e07e4e065fb83ebf5ed57fc24427e5f3d/c=876-0-3048-2172/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799337755267808-c01-main-1009.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T11:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:59:52.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
