There was plenty to celebrate after the game. While his name will be attached to the record mark for years to come, he gives all the credit to his players and staff from more than three decades of O'Gorman football. \n\"I'm really proud of everybody involved with O'Gorman high school. I think they can be very proud that as a group we were able to achieve this. It just feels really good,\" Kueter said. \nKueter passes Yankton's Max Hawk on the most wins list. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
