The home runs gave the Astros a 6-2 lead and sent the capacity crowd at Minute Maid Park into a frenzy.\nBut the Astros bullpen, especially shaky late in the season, faltered. As would Correa.\n Related Coverage Chase Utley Is Likely to Be Available for Dodgers in Game 3 OCT. 12, 2015 slideshow Baseball Fever: Sketch It OCT. 10, 2015 Will Harris allowed three consecutive singles to start the eighth inning and then another to Lorenzo Cain to bring the Royals within 6-3. Eric Hosmer, who had one hit in the series, followed with another single off left-hander Tony Sipp to make it 6-4.\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nThen Kendrys Morales hit a grounder that kicked off Sipp’s leg and under Correa’s glove for an error. Suddenly, the Royals were even, 6-6, with runners at second and third. Sipp struck out Mike Moustakas, and then was relieved by closer Luke Gregerson, who walked catcher Drew Butera after a 10-pitch at-bat.\nSecond baseman Jose Altuve made a diving stop of Alex Gordon’s grounder and threw him out, but Hosmer scored to put the Royals ahead, 7-6. After Gregerson walked Alex Rios to load the bases, he struck out Alcides Escobar to end the inning, limiting the damage but only for the time being.\nHosmer belted a two-run homer in the ninth to give the Royals a cushion and send some of the crowd heading toward the exit.\nCorrea, who had four R.B.I., gave the Astros faint hope with a leadoff single in the ninth, but Royals closer Wade Davis struck out Rasmus and pinch-hitter Preston Tucker, and retired Carlos Gomez on a soft fly to right.\nThe comeback was reminiscent of last year’s wild-card playoff when the Royals trailed Oakland, 7-3, but scored three runs in the eighth and one in the ninth to send the game into extra innings. And after the Athletics took a lead in the 12th, the Royals scored two more runs to win it.\nThe loss was sure to rekindle memories of another memorable collapse by the Astros, who were on the brink of their first World Series in 1980 when the Philadelphia Phillies scored five runs in the eighth inning at the Astrodome on their way to a decisive 10-inning victory in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series.\nThe loss will be especially hard for Correa, whose error overshadowed a dynamic day at the plate.\nCorrea, the former No. 1 overall pick who turned 21 last month, became the second youngest player to hit two home runs in a postseason game, after Andruw Jones, then 19, hit two home runs at Yankee Stadium in Game 1 of the 1996 World Series.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n Correa, whose solo homer tied the score in the third, gave the Astros the lead in the fifth when he followed George Springer’s one-out walk with a double to right that sent Springer flying all the way home, putting the Astros ahead, 3-2.\nWhen the ball whistled past Hosmer, a two-time Gold Glove first baseman, it appeared to be a sign that things had turned against the Royals this October.\nA year ago, their thrilling wild-card playoff was a springboard for a run that ended agonizingly close to a World Series title and revitalized Kansas City’s interest in baseball.\nThe Royals were a throwback to ’80s baseball — relentless on the basepaths, spectacular defensively and ready to swing at anything and everything. This season they extended that run by racing to the best record in the American League.\nBut in this series their playoff magic had begun to look ephemeral.\nCain, their breakout star from a year ago, hit a solo homer to give the Royals an early lead on Sunday, but he struck out twice in crucial situations and showed his frustration when he just missed making a diving catch, punching the padding against the outfield wall. He struck out three more times Monday.\nHosmer, who hit .351 in the postseason last year and picked up the tab for an entire bar after the Royals clinched a trip to the World Series, had more hits (two) in the final two innings than he previously had in the entire series (one).\nBut Hosmer’s arrival in the series mirrored the rest of the Royals. It was better late than never.\nCorrection: October 12, 2015\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the Kansas City Royals’ catcher. He is Drew Butera, not Sal Butera.\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
