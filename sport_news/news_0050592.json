Winfield’s famous plea during the 1992 season (‘Winfield wants noise’ screamed the headlines) captured the essence of that. They were too quiet, too polite, not rowdy enough. Certainly not at all intimidating. \nHow times of changed. Sometime in the last 20 years, Blue Jays crowds have transformed into some of the loudest, rowdiest — MOST intimidating crowds in MLB. \nThe players — both home team and opposition — certainly think so. \nKansas City Royals’ pitcher Edinson Volquez wondered aloud following the Jays’ 7-1 Game 5 win on Thursday if home plate umpire Dan Iassogna was intimidated by the Rogers Centre crowd, pointing to the called ball four on Jose Bautista in the sixth inning on a pitch that appeared to be a strike. The walk by Bautista was part of a sixth-inning surge that eventually sealed the Royals’ fate. \n“He (Iassogna) might get nervous a little bit,” Volquez said afterwards. “It’s a big game for Toronto. The fans all over him, probably.” \nIn the same game, K.C. manager Ned Yost tried to get the attention of his catcher Salvador Perez to ask Iassogna about an incident at the plate but said because the crowds were so loud, he couldn’t get anyone’s attention on the field. That never would have happened years ago. \nThe Jays, for their part, are tickled pink with the enthusiasm the fans are showing at the Rogers Centre — many calling it the best home park atmosphere they have ever experienced. Aside from the unfortunate incident in Game 5 of the ALDS when fans began throwing items, including beer cans, on to the field over a bizarre call against the Jays at home plate, the players have said that the fans in Toronto have done much to pick them up. One of the characteristics of the Jays fan base at the Rogers Centre now is their often clever and timely chants — particularly when it’s aimed at the opposing pitcher. Toronto fans have always been known to boo, especially towards players who once played for the Jays, Raptors or Leafs. But they’ve taken chanting to another level and sometimes it appears to actually throw players off — ask Royals starter Johnny Cueto who was serenaded mercilessly during the game and after he was pulled by Yost for Kris Medlin in an 11-8 loss to the Jays on Oct.19. The supportive chants are pretty loud as well, probably the best being the ‘Tulo’ and ‘MVP’ (for Josh Donaldson) chants which break out whenever those two come to the plate. \nMarco Estrada, who pitched a gem in Toronto’s 7-1 loss on Wednesday after picking up a loss in Kansas City in Game 1, gave the home fans a shout out after the win which forced a Game 6 on Friday back in Kansas City. \n“It’s been a while since I pitched here, and I forgot how great our fans were,” he said. “It was pretty loud today. I had a lot of adrenaline going. That’s the only difference. The last game I was pretty calm and I was just trying to do my job. This time I still had the same mindset, but the fans got me going a little bit early on, and just made it a little more fun.” \nSo what’s happened? Why are the fans louder and crazier at the Rogers Centre than they were years ago? One reason, Blue Jays crowds seem to be much younger now than they were in the early years of the franchise. Back when the Jays were setting attendance records and making the playoffs in the 1980s and ’90s, the Rogers Centre was jammed, but the crowds were quieter — hence Winfield’s plea. Jays players of that era sometimes complained under their breath that the fans were too passive. FOX commentator Ken Rosenthal said that MLB officials have told him that the crowds in Toronto now are some of the roughest on visiting players in the AL. Often you’ll hear about opposition outfielders having on-going conversations with the fans at Rogers Centre and once in a while, you’ll see a player, for no apparent reason, start to laugh or bow his head while standing in the outfield. \nBlue Jays fan certainly have come a long way from the early days when it seemed the majority of fans sat quietly scoring the game and cheering politely, sometimes for both teams. Now it’s just a matter of the Jays winning two games in Kansas City and giving the fans a chance to cheer them on in the World Series. \n“They’ve been huge for us since we really turned this thing around,” said Jays manager John Gibbons. “And we need them.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:20:57.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
