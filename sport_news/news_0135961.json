Two protesters were killed in police firing at a blockage and protest dharna at Behbal Kalan in Faridkot.\nBathinda range IG Jatinder Jain was also injured during the clash. The police have rounded up two Sikh leaders Panthpreet Singh and Ranjit Singh Dhadruanwala.\nAt least 6,000 protesters had gathered, demanding action against those responsible for the incident of sacrilege at Bargari village in Faridkot disctrict. Some of the protesters started pelting stones, and were asked to disperse by the police. As they did not pay heed, the police mounted a cane charge, used water cannons and even fired in the air to break up the gathering. The police also detained around 500 protesters. All schools have been closed in the area. A heavy police deployment has been made on all roads and bazaars of Kotkapura and the area near the protest site has been sealed. Protesters also blocked the Moga-Ferozepur national highway at Dagru village, and the Moga-Kotkapura highway at Samalsar and Rode villages.
