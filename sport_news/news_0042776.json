They're that type of team, they have that type of skill and they're playing well enough to do that,” Neville head coach Mickey McCarty said. “We feel like we can improve enough to be that kind of team, as well, if we continue to do the things we need to do to improve. \n“It's a big game for both teams, heading into the second half of the season here. It should be a great game, it's an exciting atmosphere, it's a great matchup and have some hype around it.” \nBoth teams bring explosive offenses to the table. Neville has scored 40 or more points in three of its four games this year, topping 50 in two of those games. Bastrop is equally dangerous, averaging 25 points a game and, like Neville, has scored over 40 points three times and over 50 points twice. The Rams even scored 56 points in their only loss of the season in the debut against Parkway.

All of them really sting you from any place on the field,” McCarty said. “They have great speed, as most Bastrop teams have. \n“(Powell) can throw it over the top of the defense with nice touch and he can throw in the quick game with nice accuracy. He's one of those guys where if you try to flush him out of the pocket, he can certainly burn you from there.” Ben Nola fuels Neville defense sans stats \nThe Bastrop defense is no pushover, either, allowing just seven points in the last two games and less than 14 per game in the last four. \n“(Bastrop) Coach (Brad) Bradshaw has always done a good job defensively,” McCarty said. “Last week they pitched a shutout, I know they're very proud of that. They always play physical defense, so we have to match that physicality.” \nFollow Brett on Twitter, @BHudsonTNS. 4 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1LlxS2M TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:57:30.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
