Sadlowski failed to get a drive in the grid in the match after winning his quarterfinal at 402. New criteria \nThe HSBC Champions made a significant change to its criteria this year, which was good news for Daniel Summerhays, Justin Thomas and Matt Jones. \nThe World Golf Championship in Shanghai previously placed an emphasis on winning tournaments, taking 20 winners from PGA Tour events (based on the strength of the field) and 10 winners from the European Tour, along with winners from the other tours. The final category was the top 50 in the world ranking. \nThis year, the world ranking was moved up to No. 3 in the order of criteria. That was followed by the top 30 from the FedEx Cup, with a caveat. At least five players had to come from the FedEx Cup list, even if that meant going beyond 30th place. \nOnly two players who made it to the Tour Championship – Steven Bowditch and Harris English – were not in the top 50 in the world. Summerhays (31), Thomas (32) and Jones (33) were next in line and are headed to Sheshan International to play for a $9.5 million purse with a big ranking in points. \nIan Poulter, meanwhile, slipped out of the top 50 at the Monday cutoff, bumped out by Andy Sullivan and Emiliano Grillo winning. Poulter narrowly finished behind Hunter Mahan, who made the cut at the Frys.com Open and then shot 67-72 to tie for 32nd. \nIt will be the first WGC event for Summerhays and Thomas. McIlroy could have been Buccaneer \nAnd to think Rory McIlroy was nearly a Buccaneer. \nThere was a time when McIlroy contemplated coming to America for college. Graeme McDowell went to Alabama-Birmingham. Colin Montgomerie was at Houston Baptist. Adam Scott spent one semester at UNLV (though it is believed he never did find the library). \nMcIlroy was lined up to play for the Buccaneers of East Tennessee State. \n“I signed a letter of intent to play for ETSU, did my SAT, did everything like that, so I was fully ready to come over and play college golf,” McIlroy said last week at the Frys.com Open. “But at that point, I knew that I really wanted to turn pro earlier. I had no intention of graduating at all, so I thought it was just better to play amateur golf.” \nIt worked out for him. He played in the Walker Cup, turned pro and effectively wrapped up his European Tour card in his second start as a pro. \n“By the time I was probably just getting out of college, I had just won my first major,” he said. “It was a good decision in the end.” \nMcIlroy didn’t mention who else recruited him out of Northern Ireland. \n“I wasn’t that good back then,” he said. Who’s No. 1? \nJason Day became the latest player to reach No. 1 in the world ranking without even playing. That’s a reflection of how close it is at the top among Day, Jordan Spieth and McIlroy. \nDay became the 12th player to reach No. 1 without playing. It happened three times to McIlroy, twice to Nick Faldo and Tiger Woods. Spieth remains in a class of his own, the only player to reach No. 1 after missing the cut (Deutsche Bank Championship). \nThe Official World Golf Ranking, aware of the skeptics because of moments like these, put out a tutorial on the ranking to explain that while neither Spieth nor Day has played since the Tour Championship, players lose points every week – full value for 13 weeks, with a gradual reduction each week beyond that. \nAnd it made sense why Day was No. 1. \nHe has earned 333.38 points over the last 13 weeks, more than double what Spieth has earned (161.71). Golden ticket \nValspar has taken over an incentive program for caddies that pays them for wearing its logo on the cap during PGA Tour events. The program previous was run by Nature Valley, and the payout is based on rounds and performance (the better the player’s score, the greater odds of being on TV). \nValspar has added a wrinkle. \nEach week, it will offer what amounts to two or three “golden tickets” for each caddie wearing the hat. The ticket could be anything from a gas card to dinner for four at a restaurant. The company, title sponsor of the Valspar Championship at Innisbrook during the Florida swing, also will offer a grand prize of a trip to a resort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:27:30.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
