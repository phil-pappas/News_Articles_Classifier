They are going to be obese and overweight,\" Stene said. \nStene lives in rural Alcester. She used to have to drive miles to get to a gym. \n\"I have some stuff at home that I can work out with,\" Stene said. \nBut now, she gets in a workout during the middle of her work day. Her employer, POET, is in the process of adding gyms to all of its facilities, including one in Hudson. \n\"I feel great. I've lost weight. I eat better,\" Stene said. \nThis gym is open to all POET employees at the Hudson plant 24 hours a day, seven day a week. \n\"There are a couple local towns in the area, but it's probably 15 to 20 miles until before you would find a good gym to workout in, and it's definitely not a 24 hour seven day a week gym,\" technical manager Jeremy Halgerson said. \nIn addition to the gym, POET is also offering employees personalized workout and nutrition plans. \n\"Some of the people out here may not know proper exercise techniques, and what not. We've been putting together videos where we go through exercise routines and show them how to effectively do that with proper form,\" wellness coordinator Brandan Fokken said. \nAfter a workout, not only does Stene feel better, but she also believes she's a better employee. \n\"I come back way more refreshed and focused. This is really nice for me,\" Stene said. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
