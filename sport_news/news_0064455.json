FOX Sports's Bruce Feldman first reported the news.\nThe highly anticipated move comes just a day after the Terrapins suffered their third straight loss, a 49–28 defeat at top-ranked Ohio State on Saturday. Offensive coordinator Mike Locksley will be the interim coach the remainder of the season, per the source. Maryland has fired director of football operations Fran Foley as well.\nMaryland has a 2–4 record this season under the 57-year-old Edsall, who is owed a $3.1 million buyout. In five seasons with the Terrapins, he had a 22–34 mark, which included a 10–24 record in conference play.\nCollege Football Video Loss to UW makes clear USC made wrong decision in hiring Sarkisian by Pete Thamel", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BruceFeldmanCFB/status/653259512065880064", "https://twitter.com/ThayerEvansSI/status/653263505240363008"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:43:40.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
