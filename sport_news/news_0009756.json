To be a Carlton captain and to be a part of that club forever is something special to me. \n“I’m happy with the choice. I would’ve liked some more success but I’ll always be really proud of my time at Carlton. \n“I’ll have an involvement with them for the rest of my life.” Stay up to date with the latest sports news Follow our social accounts to get exclusive content and all the latest sporting news!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:43:32.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
