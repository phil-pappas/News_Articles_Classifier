Left-arm seamer Aniket Chaudhary took 3 for 26 in 13 overs as he ably complemented Chahar.\nAt stumps, the home team played cautiously to reach 74 for three in 34 overs with only 65 required to take first innings lead in a match that looks set to have an outright result.\nDelhi's miseries started as early as Unmukt Chand (4) was bowled by a swinging delivery from Chahar having hit a lone boundary.\nFirst change bowler Manjeet Singh got rid off one drop batsman Vaibhav Rawal (8) caught by wicketkeeper Dishant Yagnik. Milind Kumar (6) was gone as Chahr got one to come in after pitching as Delhi were 49 for three.\nWith coach Ajay Jadeja refusing to come due to presence of assistant coach Amit Bhandari, there was no seasoned tactician in the dressing room, who would tell the boys what needs to be done.\nUnder pressure Gambhir also struggled for nearly an hour and 43 minutes as he played and missed a lot was finally gone for a painstaking 24 off 68 balls that had four boundaries.\nHe was dismissed in a now familiar fashion of playing the ugly dab shot to a delivery from Chahar that was angling out as Yagnik made no mistake behind the stumps.\nDebutant wicketkeeper Mohit Ahlawat (1) edged one from Aniket that held its line with the angle as Yagnik took his fourth catch.\nManan Sharma (2)'s dismissal made it a sorry scorecard for Delhi as it read 56 for six in 26 overs.\nSumit Narwal (25) and Pradeep Sangwan (18 no), then ensured that Delhi crossed the three-figure mark with a 48 run stand for the seventh wicket.\nNarwal, who spanked five boundaries was holed in the deep off a delivery from debutant pacer Natthu Singh.\nDelhi were soon all-out for 138.\nPlaying with a four-pronged pace attack on a helpful track, Vineet Saxena (4) and Abhimanyu Lamba (5) were dismissed cheaply by Narwal (2/15) as Rajasthan were 32 for two.\nPranay Sharma (42) hit seven fours as he added 38 for the third wicket before Pradeep Sangwan dismissed him.\nAt close of play, Menaria (19 batting) was in company of Puneet Yadav (2 batting).\nBrief Scores: Delhi 1st Innings 138 in 47 overs (Gautam Gambhir 24, Sumit Narwal 25, Deepak Chahar 5/60, Aniket Chaudhary 3/26)\nRajasthan 1st Innings: 74/3 (Pranay Sharma 42, Sumit Narwal 2/15).
