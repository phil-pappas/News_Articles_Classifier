The slip snaffled the ball a fraction above the turf to reduce England to 157 for four. \nPakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq heaped on the pressure by positioning helmet-clad fielders at silly point and short-leg as well as two slips and then three men at the boundary to prevent the batsmen lofting the ball over close field. \nBairstow initially read the spin well, lurching forward to pad the ball away on occasion and also getting on his heels to defend as necessary. \nBut he was then cleaned bowled for 22 by a Yasir googly, the ball sneaking between bat and pad to reduce England to 163 for five. \nJos Buttler (7) again provided feeble resistance, edging Yasir to Younus at slip. \nBen Stokes was nine not out and Adil Rashid eight unbeaten when lunch was called. \nThe first test of the three-game series in Abu Dhabi was drawn meaning a Pakistan victory in Dubai would ensure the hosts maintain their record of never having lost a series in their adopted home of the United Arab Emirates. \nSharjah will host the final test from Nov. 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:29:29.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
