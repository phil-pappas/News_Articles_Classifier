She's such a great champion and has been playing quite well the last month or so, winning Wuhan, so she's in great form,\" Jankovic said. \n\"I'm happy with the way I played, though, and I'm really happy I was able to beat her tonight.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:55:19.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
