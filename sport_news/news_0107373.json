The top seeded Indo-Swiss pair recorded an easy 6-2 6-3 victory over the wild card Chinese duo of Chen Liang and Yafan Wang in the semifinal match, which lasted one hour and six minutes. Sania and Hingis, who have just won the Wuhan Open, outplayed their less fancied opponents in all departments of the game. They broke the opponents' service five times in the match -- four in the first set and one in the second. They now await the result of the other semifinal match between the duo of Casey Dellacqua of Australia and Yaroslava Shveedova of Kazakhstan and Chinese Taipei pair of Hao-Ching Chan and Yung-Jan Chan. The Indo-Swiss combination has bagged seven women's doubles titles this year so far, including two Grand Slams -- Wimbledon and the US Open -- since they started playing together in March. Their WTA titles together this year include Indian Wells, Miami, Charleston, Guangzhou and Wuhan. They won their last three tournaments without dropping a single set. â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:44:43.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
