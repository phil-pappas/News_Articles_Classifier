They return their top three scorers and top two rebounders from last season in senior Tiffany Mitchell, junior Alaina Coates and sophomore A'ja Wilson. The Gamecocks' top two 3-point shooters are back (Mitchell, Tina Roy) as are their top two assist producers (Mitchell, Khadijah Sessions) and top two shot blockers (Wilson, Coates). \nSouth Carolina tops the order of finish with 265 points, with Tennessee (248), Mississippi State (215), Texas A&M (207), Kentucky (205), Ole Miss (169), and Missouri (165) rounding out the top half the league. Arkansas (138), Georgia (128), LSU (128), Vanderbilt (80), Florida (78), Auburn (65) and Alabama (34) round out the bottom half. \nSouth Carolina's Tiffany Mitchell was the overwhelming choice for SEC Women's Basketball Player of the Year with 11 votes, Mitchell's teammates A'ja Wilson and Alaina Coates also received votes, as did Tennessee's newcomer Diamond DeShields. \nJoining Mitchell, Wilson, Coates and DeShields on the All-SEC Team are Victoria Vivians, Mississippi State and Makayla Epps, Kentucky. A tie pushed the team to six members this year. Points were compiled on a 14-13-12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 basis. Each media member also voted for a five-player All-SEC Team and the Preseason SEC Player of the Year. IF YOU HAVE A STORY IDEA CONTACT WLBT/WDBD AT (601) 960-4426 OR EMAIL US AT News@WLBT.COM .
