Serena must be feeling some burnout from her Grand Slam attempt that saw her lose 13 total sets in those majors and go 11-1 in those three-setters. There was a lot of pressure on her to complete one of the rarest feats in tennis, something that had not been done since Steffi Graf in 1988. And, obviously, as the year went on, the pressure had to have become that much more intense. We saw that against Roberta Vinci in the US Open semifinals -- the culmination of a yearlong battle against incredibly high expectations. Will Serena Williams' mind and body be up to playing world-class tennis in 2016? Clive Brunskill/Getty Images \nGilbert: False. She gave it a great go. Considering how many times Serena was close to losing in all the Slams, she found a way to win. And then probably the unluckiest person of all was the one who exploited Serena's bad day. Roberta Vinci, an older player, took advantage of the pressure Serena was feeling. Serena made the same run the Bryans made a few years ago in doubles when they won the first three majors before falling just short in New York. We didn't question the pressure for them. Losses happen. \nNow 34 years old, the best of Serena is behind us \nShriver: True to an extent. Will we see a third Serena Slam? No, but she will pass Graf and come close to Margaret Court, unless Serena retires in the next two years. Serena has had a history of lapses, only to come back and win multiple majors in a row. It'll get harder with her age, but there's little to suggest she won't win a few more Slams -- maybe just not consecutively. \nGilbert: Normally, you'd say true. Yes, 34 is an unusual age to succeed, but athletes today are pushing the envelope longer. Look how amazing Tom Brady is playing at 38. I do know this, too: Never underestimate a Williams. You'd like to think that taking time off will rejuvenate Serena. She'll be a year older, but she's so much more dominant than the field that it's going to take more than one loss before we can begin to talk about the demise of Serena. \nSerena will win at least two majors in 2016 \nShriver: True. Serena will win Wimbledon and the US Open, where she has a combined 12 major titles. Her power game is most conducive to those two events, and after her shortcoming in New York this season, she is going to desperately want revenge. \nGilbert: False. But it's a tricky one. I would put the over/under at 1Â½. It's going to be near impossible to repeat 2015, and it's safe to assume she won't escape all those three-setters that she did this season. If I had to guess, I'd say she will win less than two majors. \nSerena will finish 2016 as the top-ranked player Editor's Picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:54:51.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
