(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nRedskins tight end Jordan Reed, who has missed the past two games with a concussion, said Wednesday that he fully intends to play Sunday against Tampa Bay. \n“One-hundred percent,” Reed said in an interview, asked whether he thought he’d be able to play Sunday. \nBoth Reed and left tackle Trent Williams, who’s also recovering from a concussion, took limited part in Wednesday’s practice at Redskins Park. \nNeither has been cleared for contact drills under the five-step NFL Concussion Protocol. Ideally, that step will come later this week, provided they don’t have a setback as they gradually increase their workload. \nReed, whose 24 catches for 278 yards rank third on the team, said it was difficult to watch the last two losses. \n“I feel like I could help the team,” Reed said, “so it’s frustrating to not be there for my guys and stuff like that. I’m just excited to be back out there.” \nThe Redskins’ passing game has struggled since the 6-2, 237-pound Reed left the Oct. 4 game against the Eagles the fourth diagnosed concussion of his career. \nCoach Jay Gruden’s generally upbeat injury report Wednesday included discouraging news about DeSean Jackson, the team’s big-play target in the receiving game, who hasn’t played since the first quarter of the Sept. 13 season-opening loss to Miami. \nJackson did light running and footwork drills with a trainer on a side field, as did running back Chris. But Gruden said afterward that the likelihood of getting Jackson back for Sunday’s game was “not very high.” \n“The goal is to try to get him back going, running and all that stuff, get him some rest, see how he is after the [Nov. 1] bye, but you never know,” Gruden said. “It’s a long shot, but there’s a chance.” \nDespite Reed’s insistence that he’ll play Sunday, it won’t be his decision. Concussed NFL players can return to competition only after being cleared by an independent NFL neurologist. \nBoth Reed and Williams have a few hurdles left—being cleared for and taking part in contact drills, showing no signs of a setback afterward and getting the final approval by a neurologist—before they can suit up in a game. \nBut Williams, 27, said he’s hopeful he can do all that this week. \n“I feel fine,” Williams said. “The whole protocol is a new thing; it’s new to me, so I really don’t’ know, It’s not in my hands.” \nIn Williams’s case, it has been 10 days since he suffered his first concussion as an NFL player and the second of his football career. \nIn Reed’s case, it has been two weeks and three days since he suffered the fourth diagnosed concussion of his career. Asked if that gave him additional concern about his recovery, Reed said, “No. I just leave it in God’s hands.” \nThe Redskins were without 12 of their 22 opening-day starters in Sunday’s 34-13 loss to the Jets MetLife Stadium. \nWhile Williams and Reed are progressing, center Kory Lichtensteiger (neck) and running back Chris Thompson, who has emerged as the team’s third-down back, were unable to practice Wednesday. \nGruden explained that Lichtensteiger is ailing with a disc injury that raises no concerns about potential paralysis but has weakened his left side. \n“It’s just a matter of getting his strength back on his left side, and he’s coming along pretty good,” Gruden said, declining to offer a timetable. Meantime, fourth-year player Josh LeRibeus, who filled it at center last weekend, is preparing as if he’ll start again Sunday. \nOthers who didn’t participate in Wednesday’s practice: defensive end Jason Hatcher (knee), linebacker Keenan Robinson (heel) and cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall (toe) and Chris Culliver (knee). Gruden confirmed that Culliver has had an MRI to check his surgically repaired knee but is not expected to need further surgery. \nDefensive end Stephen Paea (back) was limited in practice. And among the ailing players who were healthy enough to take full part were running back Matt Jones, who missed the Jets game with a sprained toe, Trenton Robinson (ankle) and Ty Nsekhe (foot). \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:42:12.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
