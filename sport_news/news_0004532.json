Grace Harrison (6th) and Zoe McClellan (10th) helped the winning effort. MKA’s Kathryn Correia took third overall, finishing in 20:13.09. \nMKA’s sophomore boys, thanks to Wilson and Matt Petrocelli (5th, 17:51.87), edged Columbia for the flight win in their category. \nAlso victorious were the Montclair senior boys, with Geoff Minet (3rd, 17:00.35), Imran Khawaja (7th, 17:45.40) and Jamie Keys (10th, 17:56.93) leading the way. The top local finisher in that event was MKA’s Billy Hughes, who was the runner-up in 16:53.25. \nOn the individual level, MKA’s Caylie Privitere (2nd, 20:50.86) and Montclair’s Amelia Lufrano (3rd, 21:11.06) had strong races in the junior girls category, while the MHS girls also took second as a team in the freshman girls, paced by Noa Zielinski’s fifth-place finish. \nMHS and MKA will turn their focus now to the championship season as the 2015 fall season heads down the home stretch. \nThe season’s next big event is the Essex County Championships, which will be held Friday afternoon, Oct. 30, at Brookdale Park in Montclair. The NJSIAA championships begin the following weekend with sectional meets on Saturday, Nov. 7.
