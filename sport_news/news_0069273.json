There are times I kind of have to pull them back a bit and say ‘Practice is over. You’re sisters again.’ They really try to make each other better.” \nAnd the evidence shows that it seems to be working. Eleanor, still just a sophomore, is now in her third season as a starter and earned a spot on the Times’ All-Area team a year ago. \nMeanwhile, Morgan, a junior, is now in her second season in the starting lineup. \nThe siblings played a key role in helping their team advance to the state tournament for the first time in 38 years last season (the Spartans finished as Class 2A consolation champions). \nAnd they’re part of the reason why Rocori has gotten off to a 17-1 start this fall. \n“We’ll bump heads out on the court every once in a while,” said Morgan, who has 83 kills, 17 blocks, 26 ace serves and 262 set assists so far this season. “It’s easier to yell at your sister sometimes than it is to yell at another teammate. I’ll try to get her pumped up and she does the same for me.” \nEleanor agrees that it can sometimes get heated between the two. But she said that’s also helped push both players to higher places in their respective games. \nRocori High School volleyball player Morgan Holthaus high-fives her sister Eleanor Holthaus on Thursday at Rocori.

Then she’ll do the same back to me. \n“But we’re totally honest with each other. We’ll tell each other things we need to work on. And that really helps a lot.” \nThe sisters come from a volleyball family. Their mother Angel (Rausch) played volleyball at Rocori. And the two began playing Junior Olympic volleyball together back in grade school. \n“We’ve been teammates a long time,” Morgan said. “We know each other pretty well as players now.” \nThe two also have an 8-year-old sister, Kate. And Faber already wishes she was old enough to insert into the Spartans’ lineup. \n“She’s a gym rat,” Faber said. “And she comes to all the games.” \nKate’s varsity debut will have to wait for a few years. But her older sisters are already making their impact now. \nAnd their main focus is on helping Rocori return to the state tournament again this season. \nStory continues below. \nRocori High School volleyball players celebrate after a play on Thursday during a match against Sartell High School at Rocori.

But the atmosphere was amazing. \n“I didn’t expect us to get off to such a quick start this year. We lost a lot of starters from that team. And I thought it might take some time to build things back up. But everything has come together. We’ve all gelled really well so far. We have the potential to do really well again this year.” \nFollow Frank Rajkowski on Twitter at @rajko1973 or like him on Facebook at www.facebook.com/sctimesfrank . 60 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/10/04/sibling-rivalry-helps-fuel-rocori-sisters/73344084/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:47:31.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
