Battle Mountain dropped a 20-10 decision at Basalt on Friday night. The Huskies got off to a good start with a 16-yard touchdown pass from Demetrius Parrish to Zane Hensel. Protecting a 7-0 lead the Huskies had a fantastic goal-line stand, stopping Ian Lumsden at the doorstep on fourth down. The Longhorns did find the end zone later in the second quarter as Miles Levy hit Kyle Roberts for three yards and a score. The Longhorns did miss the extra point, leaving Battle Mountain with the lead. The Huskies showed a little razzle-dazzle with Parrish hooking up with Chase Kee. Cue the hook-and-ladder to Noah Shamis. That set up Keep for a 32-yard field goal and 10-6 halftime lead. In the second half, the Huskies did not help themselves with penalty flags. A personal foul set up Cameron Firmin 13-yard touchdown run on a reverse. Two offside penalties kept another Basalt drive going. Basalt’s Raul Torres capped it with a 9-yard catch from Levy. Battle Mountain fell to 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the 2A Slope. The Huskies come next week for Coal Ridge. Meanwhile, Eagle Valley football had a rough go of it at Delta, falling to the No. 6-ranked Delta, 41-0. Eagle Valley (6-2 overall and 3-2 in the 3A Slope) is at Palisade on Friday.
