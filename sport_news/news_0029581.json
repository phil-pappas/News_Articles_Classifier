The militants have been identified as 35-year-old Adeel Pathan and 25-year-old Chota Burmi. Awantipora Superintendent of Police Muhammad Irshad confirmed the identities of the slain militants. According to the police reports, a joint cordon by the Army’s 3 Rashtriya Rifles and the special operations group of the police was laid in Haeri village of the Tral area on Sunday afternoon following intelligence inputs about the presence of militants in the area. “Militants were holed up in a residential house, which was cordoned off and contact was established with them,” said a senior police officer who was part of the operation. He said the militants tried to sneak out of the house while firing indiscriminately. “They were however intercepted and shot dead just outside the house they were hiding in,” the police officer said. The bodies of the militants have been retrieved and the identification process completed. The cordon was still intact while this report was being filed and searches were being conducted in the area. The police have recovered at least two AK-47 rifles along with ammunition. The police maintain that the killing of Pathan and Burmi was a serious blow to the Jaish’s overall presence in south Kashmir. “They had only a few people among their ranks and with the killing of these two the group stands almost wiped out,” said a police official. Pathan had been active in the Valley since infiltrating into it in 2013. Initially, operating from north Kashmir’s Kupwara district, he was heading a group of around 10 Pakistani nationals. He shifted base to Tral in 2014 after most of his accomplices in Kupwara were killed, and has been heading the outfit in south Kashmir since then. He had been working in close coordination with Hizb-ul-Mujahideen members in south Kashmir. The Jaish-e-Mohammad has been founded by Pakistani national Maulana Masood Azhar, who was captured by security forces only to get released during the 1999 Kandahar hijacking along with two other militants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:18:25.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
