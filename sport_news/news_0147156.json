He just wanted them to run a good, smart race, taking no unnecessary chances. \nThe Lions did that and more, finishing second in a 16-team field with 129 points. Centennial won the girls team title with 91 points. \n“That surprised me a lot,” Wilhelm said. “I just told the team to just go out there and do the best you can. I’ll take this second-place finish any day of the week.” \nOakdale was fourth (171). Catoctin got fifth (174). \nCatoctin junior Julien Webster, who was second at the Mountain Run Invitational at Woodsboro Park three weeks ago, was the top local finisher overall at the meet, taking fourth place in the girls race with a time of 19:54.38. Teammate Bella Kreiner finished fifth. \nIn the boys race, Urbana’s Nicholas Danner was seventh (17:15.95). The Hawks finished third in the team standings (70). \nAtholton won the boys team crown (52). Catoctin was sixth (216). \nUp until just a few hours before the meet, there was the possibility it wouldn’t be held at all. Urbana athletic director Ryan Hines and C.J. Ecalano, {span}the Hawks girls coach and meet director,{/span} held their collective breath, knowing a major downpour could bring everything to a halt. \nAt 6:45 a.m. the decision was made to go ahead with the meet. However, they did have to make some adjustments to the course, detouring around muddy areas. \nWilhelm didn’t seem to mind. \n“I like this weather; I think it’s perfect weather to run in,” he said. “I just said to my runners be careful of the mud. It was a perfect temperature to run in. Everyone had to run in it, too.” \nFor some runners, taking on the mud was a challenge. In some spots, the mud was several inches deep. A race official riding in a four-wheeled, all-terrain vehicle was always ahead of the lead runners in case anyone fell on the course. \n“The turns were the worst part, going around them,” Danner said. “I didn’t run a straight line, kind of had to weave around the muddy parts.” \nOakdale girls coach Chris Lewis has been through a few of these types of races too, but it’s something that’s always been a part of cross-country. \n“It’s not going to be perfect,” he said. “You never know what you’re going to get. As far as conditions go today, it wasn’t that bad.” \nFreshman Mary Miller led Walkersville’s girls in ninth place (20:18.48). The rest of the scoring runners for the Lions were Jennifer Simmons (18th), Joana Haizel-Cobbina (28th), Regan Bernardoni (30th) and Cara Netzer (43rd). \nWebster, who was a top 10 finisher last year, said there was a lot of mud to contend with at the 1-mile mark. \n“It was sticking,” she said. “You just had to lift your legs high, not let them slip and stick in the mud.” \nThomas Johnson’s Abby Pinto finished sixth in the girls race (20:03.67). Tuscarora’s Madelynn Gilliam got 11th (20:29.78). The Cougars’ Lillie Perella was 12th. \nOakdale’s Charlotte Kowalk, who was at the head of the pack early in the race, dropped back and finished 19th (21:11.30). Urbana’s Caroline Sanford finished 23rd (21:18.65). The Bears’ Alexa Tarzy finished 25th. \nIn the boys’ race, Catoctin’s Paul Slotwinski finished ninth (17:16.54). Urbana’s Justin Le was 11th. The Hawks’ Nathan Davis and Garrett Santis finished 15th and 16th, respectively, with Ben Landon 21st. Urbana’s Julian Bandini finished 25th. \nTJ’s Steven Stabler was 29th (17:58.33). Walkersville’s Joey Moss finished 40th (18:16.53). Tuscarora’s Gavin Prather finished 33rd (18:06.48).
