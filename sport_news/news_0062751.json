Mauney's absence to win the Professional Bull Riders World Finals event title Sunday. \nMauney, the Mooresville, North Carolina, cowboy who wrapped up his second season championship Saturday night, was unable to contend for a record third event aggregate standings title after spraining his riding arm on Bruiser in the fourth round. \nDavis, a PBR rookie from Jasper, Texas, passed the injured Mauney when he scored 85.75 points on Moto Moto in the fifth round. Davis was bucked off of David's Dream in 3.88 seconds in the championship round, but none of his closest competitors had successful rides in the 15-rider championship round. \nDavis earned a $250,000 bonus for winning the six-round event at Thomas & Mack Center. \nMauney earned a $1 million bonus for the season title. \nSweet Pro's Long John won the PBR Bull of the Year Award with 47.25 points.
