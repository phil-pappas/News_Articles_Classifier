(Photo: Rod Sanford / Lansing State Journal) Buy Photo \nOFFENSE: 5 \nFor a half, MSU imposed its will at the line of scrimmage, ran the ball effectively and threw it efficiently in less than ideal weather conditions. Then the Spartans went silent, letting a 21-0 lead ride until it was barely a lead at all. To be fair, Dennis Finley's late-second-quarter leg injury forced the Spartans to play their 6-foot center at left tackle in the second half and the play calling didn't seem as aggressive. Still, MSU nearly lost Saturday in large part because its passing game went to sleep (11 yards in the second half) and it stopped converting third downs (2 of 8). \nDEFENSE: 6 \nThe Spartans' allowed touchdowns on three straight Purdue possessions in the second half, one of them albeit on a short field after a fumbled punt snap. But poor tackling, bad angles and being flat-out outrun led to the two other scores. Still, for the third time this year, when MSU needed a stop at the end, it got it. This isn't an overwhelming defense. But it also isn't one that seems overwhelmed in big moments. From festive to frantic, MSU survives Purdue \nSPECIAL TEAMS: 4 \nMSU covered Jake Hartbarger punts fairly well and Michael Geiger hit a critical 30-yard field goal, but these two specialists nearly cost the Spartans the game. Hartbarger's mishandling of a third-quarter snap and, moments later, fumble as he was tackled, changed this game entirely. Without that play, the final score might have been 35-7. Geiger's missed 35-yard field goal, pulled left, in the third quarter could've have been costly. \nCOACHING: 6 \nWhatever mojo the Spartans had working offensively in the first half, they lost in the second. The play calling seemed conservative, though that might have been on purpose, given MSU's battered offensive line. The Spartans nearly went for it on fourth down well in their own territory — forced to punt only by a penalty. That's the sort of risk this team can't afford. But for all of MSU's trouble with style points and losses to injury, this team appears poised at the end and is 5-0. That's partly coaching. \nBOTTOM LINE \nThis isn't the No. 2 team in the country. It might not be a top 10 team right now. That's irrelevant as long as MSU can keep that goose egg in its loss column. MSU just needs to find a way to get to Columbus unbeaten or perhaps with one competitive road loss along the way. At some point, though, the injuries and inconsistencies will be bite this team.
