The meetings, set up by Populous, a global architecture firm hired by the city and involved in designing at least 13 NFL stadiums, came just days before league meetings in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday that are expected to shape the final stages of the relocation process.\nSan Diego, Oakland and St. Louis officials have not been invited to the league meetings.\nFaulconer’s office and a spokesman for the stadium task force did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Los Angeles committee and league staff will go over its relocation guidelines, relocation fees and timing of potential moves to Southern California during the meetings as momentum continues to build toward the league’s possible return to the Los Angeles market for the 2016 season.\nWhile the committee and staff will report on trends in the relocation process and discuss logical outcomes, there will be no votes or commitments on specifics.\nFaulconer, San Diego city and county officials and members of a stadium task force appointed by the mayor have said in recent weeks they remain confident they could put together a viable stadium package in San Diego if the league would extend the relocation process. According to Faulconer's schedule, the mayor was in Washington D.C. earlier this week to meet with federal lawmakers about water supply, homelessness and trade issues.\nThe Chargers and city and county officials failed to reach an agreement on plans for a $1.1 billion stadium in Mission Valley by the Sept. 11 deadline set by Faulconer that the mayor said would have enabled the city to hold a January 2016 special election on the stadium issue. The Chargers broke off negotiations with the city and county in June after being advised by their legal counsel that an environmental impact report process proposed by the city was not legal.\nWith the Sept. 11 deadline missed, the earliest likely date a special election on the stadium could be held is now June 2016. By then, the NFL’s owners are expected to have already approved either the Chargers and Raiders relocating to a $1.75 billion stadium in Carson or the Rams moving into a $1.86 billion venue in Inglewood at the former site of Hollywood Park.\nContact the writer: sreid@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:41:19.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
