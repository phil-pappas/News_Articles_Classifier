Here are this week's selections starting with Thursday night's Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans game: \nOther than a losing week, nothing bugs Pro Picks more than having no spread on a Thursday night game. \nThat's the case this time around as the Colts figure out how healthy Andrew Luck's right (throwing) shoulder is. \nThe star quarterback missed a game for the first time in his three-plus pro seasons and Indianapolis (No. 17 in AP Pro32 power poll ) was taken to the limit and beyond before beating Jacksonville in overtime. \nMatt Hasselbeck, Luck's 40-year-old backup, played reasonably well and Indy extended its string of wins within the AFC South to a record-tying 15 games. \n\"I'm going to approach this week the same way I approached last week and every other week,\" said Hasselbeck, who was ill and absent from practice Tuesday, further clouding the picture. \"I expect him to play, but I'll be ready if needed.\" \nHouston (No. 28 in AP Pro32) has been among the most disappointing teams in the NFL, but it has two-time Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt operating against a mediocre offensive line. \n\"I would say Andrew Luck will play in the game, so we will prepare for him,\" Texans coach Bill O'Brien said. \nWhether he plays or not, the Texans will end Indy's impressive streak. \nTEXANS, 24-20 \nNo. 1 New England (minus 7 1-2) at No. 15 Dallas \nThe Cowboys might be too banged up to handle Boston College, let alone the Patriots. \nBEST BET: PATRIOTS, 33-17 \nNo. 30 Jacksonville (plus 3) at No. 32 Tampa Bay \nSkirmish in the Sunshine State? More like a finger fight, but we think Jaguars are better team. \nUPSET SPECIAL: JAGUARS, 17-16 \nNo. 8 Seattle (plus 1 1-2) at No. 5 Cincinnati \nJust don't like what we're seeing from the Seahawks. \nBENGALS, 22-16 \nNo. 10 St. Louis (plus 9) at No. 2 Green Bay \nPackers remain unbeaten, but Aaron Rodgers goes down a few times. \nPACKERS, 27-17 \nNo. 21 Washington (plus 7 1-2) at No. 4 Atlanta \nFalcons remain unbeaten, Matt Ryan and Julio Jones have another big day. \nFALCONS, 31-20 \nNo. 3 Denver (minus 5 1-2) at No. 19 Oakland \nBroncos remain unbeaten despite spotty offense thanks to big-play defense. \nBRONCOS, 24-13 \nNo. 7 Arizona (minus 3) at No. 27 Detroit \nLions in danger of imploding, Cardinals have protection issues. \nCARDINALS, 26-21 \nNo. 25 Cleveland (plus 6 1-2) at No. 18 Baltimore \nBrowns will do as always, make it close and lose in the end. \nRAVENS, 20-17 \nNo. 31 San Francisco (plus 7) at No. 12 New York Giants \nRevitalized Giants against reeling 49ers. \nGIANTS, 27-14 \nNo. 11 Pittsburgh (plus 3) at No. 16 San Diego, Monday night \nWith Big Ben, an ideal Upset Special. With Mike Vick ... \nCHARGERS, 21-20 \nNo. 26 Chicago (plus 9) at No. 20 Kansas City \nBears found way to win, Chiefs really are struggling. Still ... \nCHIEFS, 23-17 \nNo. 14 Buffalo (minus 3) at No. 23 Tennessee \nBills are on every-other-week ride. This week is a good one. \nBILLS, 21-13 \nNo. 24 New Orleans (plus 5 1-2) at No. 22 Philadelphia \nA pair of disappointing and struggling teams. At some point, we need to jump off the Philly bandwagon. \nEAGLES, 19-17 \nKNOCKOUT LEAGUE TIP \nSAN DIEGO made it too tight for comfort last week, but survived. Lots of potential choices this week (New England, Atlanta, Green Bay, Kansas City). Our suggestion: NEW YORK GIANTS. \n2015 RECORD \nAgainst spread: Week 7-7, Season (33-27-1). \nStraight up: Week 10-5, Season (41-22) \nBest Bet: 2-2 against spread, 3-1 straight up. \nUpset special: 1-3 against spread, 1-3 straight up. \nPhoto: Tony Tribble for Local12.com. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
