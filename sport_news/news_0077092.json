Azhar was present at the arena for a good amount of time and was seen chatting with some senior Vidarbha players. Some DDCA mandarins have, however, not taken kindly to the BCCI missive. Contrary to some reports, Azhar did not enter any dressing room at the stadium.\nMatch referee Rajendra Jadeja, who did not react when the former star - who is serving a life ban imposed by BCCI - was at the ground, has blamed DDCA for the goof-up. Azhar was seated next to the sight-screen at the old pavilion end, where some DDCA officials were also present. Vidarbha players Wasim Jaffer , S Badrinath along with coach Paras Mhambrey came out of the dressing room, walked past the cordoned area and came to chat with Azhar. The conversation went on for nearly an hour.\nWhile DDCA vice-president Chetan Chauhan has acknowledged the goof-up and said that the association would be more careful in future, everyone involved with the incident turned a blind eye to regulations. Regular workshops are conducted for domestic players, officials and associations to brief them about anti-corruption rules. Still, experienced players like Mhambrey, Jaffer and Badrinath chose to forget them. Strangely, no action was taken by the anti-corruption official and the match referee at the ground. \"Why didn't the referee object on the spot,\" said a senior DDCA official.\nDelhi assistant coach Amit Bhandari, who only shook hands with Azhar, too received a letter from the board. Sources in the Vidarbha team said their players only exchanged pleasantries with Azhar. VCA president Prakasht Dixit, however, has advised the team to be \"more cautious\" about such matters in future.\n(With inputs from Ruchir Mishra)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:05:29.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
