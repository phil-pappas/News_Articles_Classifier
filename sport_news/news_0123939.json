Florida Gators defeated the Eastern Kentucky Colonels 52-3. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports Apparently Jonathan Bullard isn't impressed by LSU's star running back Leonard Fournette.\nAdChoices The Florida defensive lineman had some choice words for the Tigers' running back on Tuesday. Bullard believes his defense will have no problem in stopping Fournette on Saturday in Tiger Stadium.\nGators DT Jon Bullard on LSU's Fournette: \"He's nothing that we can't stop.\"\n— Mark Long (@APMarkLong) October 13, 2015 From a statistical standpoint it should be a good matchup. Florida ranks No. 16 in total defense, allowing only 99.2 yards per game on the ground.\nOn the other side of the proverbial coin, LSU is averaging 346.4 yards per contest rushing the football. Fournette himself is putting up an average of 204.4 yards through the first five games of the season.\nOne may want to remind Bullard about the comments Auburn defensive back Johnathan \"Rudy\" Ford's made on Fournette...\nIt didn't work out too well for Auburn.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/APMarkLong/status/654053115319205888", "http://www.ncaa.com/stats/football/fbs/current/team/22", "http://www.ncaa.com/stats/football/fbs/current/team/23", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/lsu-football-auburn-player-fournette-disrespect-091515", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:47:34.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
