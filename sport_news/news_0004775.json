And she can still see the cold steel of handguns pointed at her face on three separate occasions. \nNone of these instances were cases of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Because when you hang with the wrong people, it's always the wrong place and the wrong time. \n\"It was a situation where we were selling drugs and someone kicked in the door to rob us,'' Taylor says in a matter-of-fact recounting of one life-risking incident, part of a lifestyle the Rochester resident tries every day to leave behind her. \"Another time off Hudson, a guy came into the house looking for drugs and he says he's going to pat us down. I was bold as a young girl and as we're cursing him out, the guy pulls out a gun and shoots it in the air. The guy is so mad at me, going 'Who is this girl mouthing off?' He wanted to kill me.'' \nShe pauses. \"Yahweh and his Son ... my biggest supporter for survival.'' \nTaylor, wearing glasses with her hair pulled into a tight bun, is a confident woman who speaks comfortably about a hard-scrabble and harrowing past. She can do so because of how far she has come, and where she wants to go. \nStarting Monday, Taylor, a single mom of three young sons ages 8, 6 and 5 – who two years ago weighed 241 pounds and was told to stay in the kitchen because her days as a boxer were finished -- will compete in the USA Boxing Olympic Team Trials for the 2016 Summer Games in Rio. \nTaylor qualified for the trials at middleweight (165 pounds) by winning a bronze medal last month – at age 29 – at an open qualifying tournament in Baltimore and will be one of 24 women seeking a spot on Team USA in Memphis, Tennessee. \nHer eight-fighter bracket includes 2012 gold medalist and No. 1-ranked Claressa Shields, 20, of Flint, Michigan, whose coach is former Rochester resident Gloria Peek.

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nA dozen years ago, Taylor was an accomplished teenage boxer for St. Martin's Boxing Club, winning multiple titles at events like the Golden Gloves, Empire State Games and the state fair. With no Olympic goal to pursue (women did not start boxing in the Games until 2012), Taylor dreamed, and still does, of a professional career, like Laila Ali and Christy Martin. \nBut then life happened. \nDrug dealing. The relentless pull of the streets. A two-pack-a-day cigarette habit and marijuana use. She experienced homelessness. She became pregnant three times. She was in and out of an assortment of jobs. Inside the ring of her soul, she waged a constant tug of war between starting a new life in Charleston, South Carolina, and being here for her family in her hometown. \nBut Taylor has gotten to this point because she refused to quit on herself and her children. And because many people refused to quit on her. \nPeople like Derick Gramling, her personal fitness coach at World Gym on East Avenue. Like her handlers, Rocky Fratto and Jim Cassidy, the kind-hearted professional boxing managers and promoters who have presided over a few ring renaissances in Rochester. Like Taylor's family, her mom, Carol Price, and siblings Tylease, Cantrish, Lonnie and Lorenzo. \nAnd she's gotten here because she never quit on boxing. \n\"I was very rough, a tomboy,'' Taylor says. \"I sold drugs and did things I shouldn't have done. I probably should be in prison or probably should be dead. I had a lot of guns pointed in my face. I had a mouth on me when I was younger, but boxing has tamed me. It tamed me, it disciplined me. I allowed it to do that. I've been everywhere with boxing. Been down, up, good, bad. But it is what tamed me.'' \nFight for survival \nTaylor, the baby in her family, grew up without a father. With her mom working two jobs, a troubled, unsupervised childhood morphed into many years as a young teen spent in detention group homes and foster care. \n\"I'd run away and be in the streets,'' she says. \"When I'd get tired of the streets, I'd turn myself in and go to school, go back to lock-up or foster care.''

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nShe would attend three elementary schools and three high schools, including Gates Chili where she played basketball. But it was boxing that tossed Taylor a lifeline when she was 13. At the other end of the rope was Don Simkin, now a retired probation officer and founder of St. Martin's Boxing Club, who spotted Cierra on the street one day and stopped his van. \n\"When Don first saw me, I had a black eye,'' Taylor says. \"I got into a fight with this guy and Don pulls up, because my sister's husband was on probation, and he'd seen me with them. He asks about the eye, and then goes, 'You want to come and box? ' He had what everyone called the 'Barney Bus' and I was like, 'You going to bring me back?' He goes 'Yeah, I'll bring you back. I'll pick you up and we can do it every day if you like it.' So I jumped in the van and that was all it took.'' \nShe has never forgotten Simkin's guidance and dedication. And she has never forgotten the feeling lacing up the gloves and getting into the ring – usually against boys – gave her. \n\"When I first started I was able to let out so much anger. It was a relief at that moment,'' Taylor says. \"I used to be the only female, so when I started I was boxing a lot of the boys. I'd have tears in my eyes boxing these guys, and I'd get frustrated, but it was an outlet for me. I think that's why I started loving boxing, it became my release from stress.'' \nTraining under Charles Murray, Rochester's only world title holder, she became good at it, too. \nBut then after the stabbing incident, after leaving Murray's tutelage and finding opportunities drying up in boxing locally, something in Taylor's gut told her she had to leave this city. \n\"A lot of things were going on, being in the streets, and something was just telling me to move,'' she says. \"I felt I had to save my life in some way.'' \nShe was 17. \nFrom living in a homeless shelter in a strange city to sleeping at a gym to getting a job at a restaurant and moving into an apartment, Taylor's life in Charleston wasn't easy. But over the course of two years she had built a life in and out of the ring. \nAnd just when she was about to turn pro, she got a phone call from home. Her nephew, Damien, just 5 months old, had died. She had never gotten to hold her brother Lorenzo's child. \n\"I began to question whether I was putting boxing before my family,'' says Taylor, who has a tattoo of a sleeping baby Damien on her left bicep. \"It taught me to have balance.'' \nPerseverance she had by the spit bucket. \nLeft to right, Lyfe, Legacy and Legend pose with their mom, Olympic boxing hopeful Cierra Taylor. (Photo: PROVIDED) \nWhile splitting her time between Rochester and Charleston over the next eight years, Cierra celebrated the births of her three sons – Lyfe-Cyril, Legend, and Legacy. There are two different fathers not in the picture and Taylor, who owns her GED, has worked as a chef, housekeeper, floor technician and construction laborer to support her family, as well as running her own business called QE Entertainment, providing recreational-based day care out of her home. \n\"Me, I don't hold grudges against anybody, I can't make anybody do what they don't want,'' she says. \"But for my sons' sake, I try to keep myself positive. I do what I do whether he (the dad) is going to be involved or not.'' \nAnswering the bell \nFast food became part of Taylor's busy life as a single mom. By 2013 her weight had soared to 241 pounds on her 5-foot, 9-inch frame. \nA boxer himself, Derick Gramling had seen Taylor spar – without head gear against a male fighter no less -- a year earlier and recognized her at their sons' youth football game in September 2014. \n\"We start talking about boxing … and one thing led to another,'' Gramling says. \"Ever since that time it's been an unbelievable story.'' \nLike the part where Taylor transforms herself by dropping 81 pounds. \n\"When I moved back the last time, people in boxing are telling me I was fat, to stay home and be a mom,'' Taylor says. \"Basically, it was quit boxing. But Derick would come and get me and take me to World Gym to see what kind of heart and willpower I had.'' \nWith a regimen filled with crossfit training, swimming and sparring – while cutting back on carbohydrates and sugars in her diet – Taylor, who had already begun the process of getting back in shape, began shedding pounds under Gramling like a dog sheds fur for summer. She also had to quit the smokes, the pot, the Red Bull and Olde English malt liquor.

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \n\"I'd take pictures and video just to show her progression, when she's struggling, throwing up, the blood, sweat and tears,'' Gramling says. \"These are the types of things that you have to do if you really want to get into the kind of arena she's talking about. I've always said, 'We'll take will over skill any day.' Because I can give you the skill, but I can't give you will. Will is not taught, will is not given. You're born with it.'' \nGramling had spoken to Fratto, his one-time manager, about Taylor and when Fratto and Cassidy arrived at World Gym last December to scout amateur heavyweight Sean Johnson, they got a chance to see Taylor in action. And it happened to be against Johnson and Gramling, a champion physique competitor. They couldn't believe their eyes. \n\"Derick has abs on top of abs and moves pretty good, and she's in there slugging it out,'' Cassidy says. \"She's giving as well as taking and I said to Rock, 'Gee, this girl is really impressive.' I'm not a big fan of women in boxing. I've appreciated people like Christy Martin and Laila Ali. But this girl looks like she should be a good pro.'' \nFratto, 57, the popular Geneva boxer who fought for the world super welterweight title in 1981, said meeting Taylor rekindled his interest in the fight game.\"She had gotten down to about 190 pounds in November, December and I go to Jim, 'I love her passion,' \"Fratto says. \"She was getting hit with shots, her eyes are watering, and she's still trying like hell. She probably tries harder than anybody I've worked with. I told her then, 'You got a shot. You got the potential to get to the Olympic Trials.' '' \nThe process began with a strong showing at 178 pounds at the National Golden Gloves last July in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where Taylor lost a 3-2 decision to 2014 USA Boxing heavyweight champion Krystal Dixon of New Rochelle. Two amateur bouts, two months and 18 fewer pounds later, Taylor then took part in the Olympic qualifier in Baltimore where she upset a favored Heidi Henricksen of Minnesota 3-0 in the first round, then lost a controversial 3-0 bout to Iesha Kenney of Virginia in the semifinals. \nIn the consolation round, a fighter from California failed to show, handing Taylor the bronze medal and berth at the Olympic Trials. \n\"It had been like seven years since I actually had a fight, so I was nervous,'' says Taylor of climbing through the ropes again and moving her amateur record to 18-5. \"But once I got in the ring, I felt like I was home again and I had people behind me. When you have people behind you, it makes you feel very confident and settled inside yourself.'' \nNow it's about settling the question of who will represent the United States at 165 pounds in Rio? \nShields is the face of Olympic women's boxing and there's a good chance Taylor will draw her first. An upset win by Taylor would make headlines. \n\"It will make a statement that's for sure,'' says Fratto, whose Geneva Granite company is helping sponsor Taylor. \"But just to come down from 240 pounds to 165 and make the Olympic Trials? The hard work that took to get here? It really tells you how much Cierra wants this. She's extremely hungry. She's full of heart and she's got me inspired. It's a good thing.'' \nLooking yourself in the mirror \nNot everyone supports Taylor's boxing quest. Simkin, the man who introduced Taylor, and hundreds of other city children to boxing as a means to teach life lessons, has never encouraged the pursuit of professional ring careers. \n\"The age-old question of any coach in any sport is asking, 'What will you do with the rest of your life?' It's an education. A job. That sort of stuff … not the boxing,'' Simkin says. \"She (Taylor) won a lot of things when she was younger but somewhere lost perspective. Cierra needs to get a good job, and take care of her kids.''

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nThat's sensible advice Taylor has heard many times from many people. \nBut the idea of earning a few professional paydays to support her children as well as the dream of becoming a role model for girls and women in the city – and doing so with Olympic credentials – remains such a strong voice inside her it screams from atop the turnbuckles. By her estimation, she's had 20 people in her life die from violence, mostly guns, and suicide, a half dozen in the past six months alone. She wants to make a difference. \n\"It starts with the parents or the adults around the kids,'' Taylor says. \"In Rochester right now, it's like we're in a war. There's a type of shooting, a killing, gang stuff, every day. What got me to focus was wanting something. Wanting to be something. And wanting to change something in me. I had to find out who I was, because I had lost myself. I knew what I liked to do as a kid, but the world changes you as you grow up. I really had to search inside myself, to find out what I wanted to be and we have to help our kids do the same. And it's teenagers and college kids, too. That's our future. You push these kids away, (then) there is nothing.'' \nAs a female athlete, Taylor plans to speak to young people at the detention centers, like Northhaven, where she once lived. There is synergy between her QE Entertainment, Fratto's \"First Me Foundation'' and Gramling's \"Team Lift: Life Inspired Fitness Training,'' which are grass-roots efforts to guide, encourage and inspire people to live productive, fulfilling lives. \n\"I truly believe that young women, even men and boys, can look up to Cierra and say, 'Man, if she did it, I can do it,' '' Gramling says. \"She went through the struggles of life. Maybe others will say, 'I don't have to be bad to get noticed. I don't have to sell drugs, sell my body to do well in life.' Our society needs more of those who have been through the struggles to teach others and she's very keen on that.'' \nEven as the baby sister, Cierra is a rock for everyone - strong and always positive during a crisis - oldest sister Tylease McClain says. Going 15 rounds with life has taught Cierra well and her family could not be more proud of her and her goal to represent her country in the Olympics. \n\"It's all dedication, believing in yourself,'' McClain says. \"Without that, you don't get anywhere. Cierra believes she can make it. Even now, were she to train younger people to box and to be fit, she has an excellent future. She can show what it's like to overcome obstacles in life and be a better person, no matter what life throws at you.'' \nCierra says she was inspired by her own mother, Carol, who after years of struggling and losing custody of her children, has turned her life around to become \"a great grandmother. Her life has changed so much.'' \nAs has Cierra's. When it comes to her own children, they often accompany her to the gym. She home schools her eldest son, who can be seen doing his homework or playing in the kids' room at World Gym. \n\"I try to keep boxing in its place and when I'm home, I'm just mommy,'' Cierra says. \n\"She's the ultimate mother hen and very protective and doing it in a unique and tough way,'' Cassidy says. \"She's just such an interesting person to Rocky and I. She's come up the hard way and wants to make it better for herself and her kids. She's confident - and so are we - in her ability.'' \nEpilogue \nCierra Taylor can still see the handgun pointed at her face. Just because she refused to give the man who was wanted for murder a cigarette. \n\"He's going, 'You want to get me to do something to you?' I go, 'No, I have a higher power that's with me.' I don't know if people believe in God or not but I've always read the Bible. I'd been walking the street, sleeping on porches, and I'd read the Bible. That's definitely kept me a afloat in this jungle we live in.'' \nPathway to Rio \nWhat: U.S. Olympic Team Trials for women's boxing. \nWhen, where: Oct. 26-31, Cook Convention Center, Memphis, Tennessee.
