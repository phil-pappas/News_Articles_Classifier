The company moved to Corona last year.\n“It got rid of wrinkles, but it got rid of every thing else, too,” she said. “If you’ve ever had a scab from falling off a bicycle or motorcycle, that’s the kind of scab that was created.\n“I set out to figure out what we could formulate for other women.”\nThe advice she got was to use Crisco, the shortening used for baking and frying chicken, because it was “really thick” and there were no skin products available to seal her skin.\n“They needed an occlusive, something to put on the skin to keep it from drying out and to keep it covered, basically. So we set out originally to formulate an occlusive that could be used after plastic surgery procedures. And to this day we still sell in that market.”\nThe company now has almost 50 products sold in various sizes in the United States and internationally. It has products for post-surgical care, diabetic care, baby care, first aid, acne and other specialized needs. Most sell for $6.99 to $24.99 on the TriDerma website.\nFrom August through October, TriDerma is donating 20 percent of its proceeds from certain products to the American Childhood Cancer Organization. They are products that could be useful for sick children: foot cream, bruise relief, radiation relief, post-laser occlusive and scar-healing gel.\nIn addition to retail, TriDerma’s markets include hospital supply companies, home health care and independent pharmacies. And Vanderlaan would like to expand into pet care products.\nTriDerma got into the majors because it had a niche, a Goldilocks-like sweet spot between medicine and competitors’ creams that had little effect.\n“We were kind of in the middle. We weren’t a drug, so we didn’t have the side effects. But we were more efficacious than the average product that sat on the shelf.”\nEven though TriDerma products aren’t defined as drugs, Vanderlaan says they have integrity.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvkdkx-b88519870z.120151001160500000gbsc65r9.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvkdkx-b88519870z.120151001160500000gbsc65r9.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvkdkx-b88519870z.120151001160500000gbsc65r7.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvkdky-b88519870z.120151001160500000gbsc65tj.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvkdkx-b88519870z.120151001160500000gbsc65r7.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "https://www.triderma.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvkdky-b88519870z.120151001160500000gbsc65tj.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:10:23.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
