(AP) - The Greenville Public School District this year won't have as much money to provide educational services for students housed at the Washington County Juvenile Detention Center.\nThe Delta Democrat-Times reports ( http://bit.ly/1Ln12Ay ) the Gregg School, which provides educational services for students at the detention center, will get about $34,000 in federal funds this year compared to about $72,500 in 2014.\nFederal Programs Director Sherry Jackson told the district's Neglected & Delinquent Collaboration meeting on Wednesday that the funds are generated based on a student count that's completed during October of the previous school year. Because the number of students in October 2014 was lower than the number for October 2013, the allocation was reduced.\nJackson says the funding covers a variety of things, including hiring teachers, purchasing supplies and drug and alcohol abuse counseling.\nInformation from: Delta Democrat-Times, http://www.ddtonline.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1Ln12Ay"], "published": "2015-10-02T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:50:03.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
