And that's good enough for sole possession of first place in the NFC East.\nQuarterback Eli Manning hit tight end Larry Donnell for a spectacular 12-yard touchdown pass in the back of the end zone with 21 seconds left , as the Giants won their third straight game, held off a whale of a catastrophe against the San Francisco 49ers , and escaped with a 30-27 come-from-behind triumph in front of 78,515 on Sunday night at MetLife Stadium.\nThe Giants led by 10 points in the first half, but let the hapless Niners hang around long enough to make it a game, and then some, before Manning delivered his 27th career fourth quarter rally.\nSan Francisco showed up to the Meadowlands riding a three-game losing streak, and having been outscored 107-28 during the skid. But quarterback Colin Kaepernick got some of his mojo back, throwing for 262 yards and two touchdowns. And the Niners rushed for 124 yards on 27 carries against the Giants' top-ranked rush defense, with Carlos Hyde running it in from 2 yards out to give the Niners the lead with 1:45 left in the game, moments after safety Landon Collins dropped an interception in the end zone.\nPLUS : Daniel Fells tweets Giants good luck, says MRSA will not defeat him\nBut the Giants had an answer, taking over with 1:41 left and rallying down the stretch to avoid what would have been a disastrous defeat.\nThe Giants went 82 yards over eight plays, taking advantage of two big passes to running back Shane Vereen out of the backfield, as well as a pass interference call on receiver Odell Beckham Jr., before Manning hit Donnell for the decisive score.\nSo now, just three weeks after blowing a fourth quarter lead against the Falcons in the home opener to fall to 0-2, the Giants have gone from a season on the brink, to the top of NFC East after starting their crucial five-week stretch on a strong note. At 3-2, the Giants now have a game lead over the rest of the division. The Cowboys, Eagles and Redskins are all 2-3.\nThe Giants took a 20-13 lead into the fourth quarter after Beckham hauled in a 17-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter. He then left the game.\nThe Niners drove right down the field though, tying the game at 20 with 11:49 left as quarterback Colin Kaepernick hit tight end Garrett Celek for a 5-yard touchdown pass. Josh Brown then kicked a field goal with about five minutes left to give the Giants a 23-20 lead.\nTurning point : Manning's touchdown pass to Donnell. A week after Rashad Jennings' 51-yard touchdown catch-and-run in Buffalo, the Giants have themselves another potentially season-saving moment.\nIt was over when : The Giants stopped the Niners on the final play of the game.\nGame notes : Manning moved past former Giant Kerry Collins for 12th all-time in career passing yards. ... Tight end Will Tye had a strong night , registering the first four catches of his career. ... Vereen had a touchdown reception in the first half for his first score as a Giant.\nNext up : The Giants will be back in primetime next Monday when they make the trip down to Philadelphia for their first of two meetings with the Eagles. The Birds are 2-3 after putting together their best offensive performance on Sunday in a 39-17 win over the Saints.\nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.
