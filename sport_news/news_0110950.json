San Diego officials expressed their disappointment that Phil Mickelson Design has been excluded from the renovation of the North Course at Torrey Pines Golf Course.\nAdChoices Mayor Kevin Faulconer and City Golf Manager Mark Marney weighed in on the subject after Mickelson disclosed that a state regulation won't allow him to finish the design project he started three years ago.\n\"Phil Mickelson has been a great partner in the effort to make San Diego's world-class Torrey Pines golf course even better,\" Faulconer said in a statement. \"I know many are disappointed that state regulations prohibit his firm from formally bidding on the next phase of the project, but I hope he will continue to remain involved in this civic effort as a hometown hero and one of the great golfers of our time.\"\nMarney added that while he is disappointed that Mickelson Design is out, \"At this point, we're optimistic that we will have a bidder and a successful team that come in and execute the general development plan that was approved.\"\nMickelson, a native San Diego who has won 42 times on the PGA Tour, announced on Tuesday that he would not be allowed to finish the Torrey North design project, and the city later received confirmation of that from the California Fair Political Practices Committee.\nFPPC attorneys concluded that Phil Mickelson Design and another firm, Schmidt Design, could do no further work at Torrey Pines because they had performed the preliminary work on which the Request for Proposal was based.\nAccording to the FPPC, any further involvement by those entities would violate Section 1090 of the state's Political Reform Act.\nMickelson's statement said his firm was informed that, \"any person or company that worked on preliminary designs may not participate in the design and/or construction resulting from this Request for Proposal and the ensuing contract.\"\nMarney said he was told three or four bids on the $12.6 million project were received by the deadline on Tuesday. That was much higher than the original estimate because of unforeseen new costs, including the city's adoption of paying prevailing wages.\nMickelson Design, which originally estimated that the project would cost about $6 million, was unhappy with the addition to the project of a new pump station and sprinkler heads for the South Course.\nMarney claimed the additions were necessary and fiscally prudent because they could be piggy-backed on the North Course project.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportsxchange.com/tsxfiles/topstories", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:52:16.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
