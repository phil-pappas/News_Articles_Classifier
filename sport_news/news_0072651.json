Earlier this year cases of glanders, a lethal highly contagious bacterial infection, were recently diagnosed in a few horses stabled at a military facility near the site of the 2016 Olympic equestrian competitions. \nOfficials said the disease had been contained and represented no threat to the Olympic events. \nThe Federation Equestre Internationale - the world governing body of the sport - echoed Guigni’s warning, saying in a statement that the Agricultural Ministry’s failure to approve the veterinary certificate and protocol needed to bring horses in and out of Brazil had derailed planning for the games. \n“The process…has already taken a lot of time and is still not finished,” the statement quotes FEI president Ingmar de Vos as saying. “This has an important impact as it delays planning and preparation of the horses that will take part in the games.” \nShould Rio’s equestrian events have to take place elsewhere, it would not be the first time. \nDuring the 1956 Melbourne Olympics they were held in Sweden because of Australia’s rigorous quarantine regulations, and they were held in Hong Kong during the 2008 games in Beijing. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:58:06.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
