Mallett also left the field before before the Texans kicked the extra point following their Hail Mary touchdown in the final seconds of the first half.\n“There was, like, one second left on the clock,” Texans coach Bill O’Brien said. “I know that I thought the half was over. … I don’t know anything about [Mallett leaving].”\nThough Hoyer’s final pass — an interception — sealed the defeat, O’Brien had nothing but praise for Mallett’s rival signal-caller during the postgame press conference.\n“I thought Brian did a good job though. He went in there, it wasn’t the easiest of circumstances — other than the last play where he kind of launched it up there,” the second-year head coach told the media . “He probably wants to have that one back, but I thought he did a good job.”\nO’Brien said he has yet to decide who will start against the Jaguars in Week 6.\n“I haven’t talked to the staff yet about it. We’ll sit down and review the film,” he said.\nWhen Mallett lost the starting job in the preseason, he responded by oversleeping for the next day’s practice. It doesn’t appear much has changed in his attitude.\n  bill o'brien ,  brian hoyer ,  houston texans ,  ryan mallett", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:32.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
