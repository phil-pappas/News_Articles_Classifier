(Photo: Tony Ding Associated Press) \nWhen Jim Harbaugh arrived as Michigan football coach last winter, he removed rivalry references to Michigan State and Ohio State inside Schembechler Hall by taking down countdown clocks and various signs. \nThat tone that has continued, as U-M prepares for its first rivalry game on Harbaugh's watch: Saturday against MSU (3:30 p.m., ESPN). He said today that he \"couldn't recall\" when he took down the clocks and signs. \nAnd asked about re-establishing Michigan as the in-state power, with the Spartans having won six of the past seven games, Harbaugh was ready to move on. \n\"Winning the next game is the goal. That's the most important thing, there's nothing more important than that,\" he said. \"The past? Think about the 'Lion King:' Simba gets hit over the head, and he tells him, 'The past can hurt.' You can either run from it or embrace it and learn from it. I think that's exactly (the way) he said it. Those seem like very wise words.\" \nHarbaugh understands the importance of the rivalry game, having played in it. He broke his arm in the 1984 loss, then dominated the Spartans in 1985 and 1986, as U-M's quarterback. But he wasn't interested in revisiting those days today. \n\"It's a trophy game. We want to get the best grades, win the most awards, want to excel at sports, and this is a game that has a trophy associated with it,\" Harbaugh said. \nThat was the overall tone at today's Michigan news conference. No concern over MSU's beatdowns the past two years. Just the next game on the schedule, which happens to be against MSU. \n\"It's shown throughout the whole season: one week at a time, one day at a time, and it's on to the next game after the previous one,\" U-M fullback Joe Kerridge said. \"There's always that extra something, especially from (linebacker Desmond Morgan) and other guys in here about being an in-state rivalry and knowing people at the other schools and things like that. But at the end of the day, it's another game that we have to come and compete.\" \nSo you're fine with the de-emphasis of the rivalry, in favor of the consistency? \n\"It's been working so far, and coach Harbaugh knows what he's doing,\" Kerridge said. \"He's been successful.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:04:02.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
