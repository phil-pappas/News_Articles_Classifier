Former Mayor Bud Clark and other city officials were also there, giving tributes and sharing memories of the trident-holding venus' arrival by barge in 1985.\nOf course, one thing they didn't mention was what happened on April 1, 1986, when she was just a baby of less than a year old.\nPranksters hung a giant yo-yo from from Portlandia's dice-throwing hand.\nOn April 1, 1986, pranksters hung a giant yo-yo from the Portlandia statue. Joseph Rose | The Oregonian/OregonLive The round disc read, \"Portland Yo-Yo, Co.\"\nThe Oregonian reported that the stunt was \"perpertrated at 3:20 a.m. by three young men with a ladder.\" A maintenance mechanic apparently pulled the 40-pound yo-yo from the statue before sunrise.\nStill, a photo of the stunt landed on the front page.\nThe Oregonian/1986 Letters to the editor, expressed thanks for the laugh:\nThe Oregonian/1986 Best.
