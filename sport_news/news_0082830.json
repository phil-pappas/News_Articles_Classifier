That's the problem many African-American women in Sioux Falls are facing. \nThere aren't a lot of options around for women looking to meet the special skills of styling ethnic hair. \nBeverly Splonskowski spent 11 years searching for a hair stylist skilled enough to handle the special needs of her ethnic hair. \n“I was never satisfied, I was always disappointed or it didn't turn out right or my hair was ruined and I would have to get it cut off and start over again,” Splonsowski said. \nThat is until she happened to be walking by the Hair by Stewarts salon in the Empire Mall and noticed the woman in Ja’Neen Kornegay's chair. She made an appointment right away in hopes that she had finally found someone who knew how to style her hair the way she wanted. \n\"I just had this sudden click with her, this rapport, you know it was really like okay, I'm in good hands,\" Splonskowski said. \nThis is only her third appointment with Kornegay, but Splonskowski already has a lot of trust in her stylist's skills and abilities. Kornegay said she's one of the only licensed African-American beauticians who styles ethnic hair in a shop. \n\"Most of the time what I do get requested for would be sew-in weaving, dread locking, braiding, and natural styling,\" Kornegay said. \nThe growing demand means a growing client list, but Kornegay admits it can sometimes be a heavy load to carry by herself. \n\"In a way it is rewarding but at the same time it puts you under a lot of pressure, because your schedule fills up fast and you know some people are more over impulse. Can I get it now? Can I get it today? Well no, I'm busy and I don't have anyone to refer you too,\" Kornegay said. \nThose referrals mean many African-American women are forced to search out of the city for more options. Some even go as far as driving several hours to Minneapolis or Omaha for an appointment with a hair stylist. \n\"It is so many African American women that are in Sioux Falls, and we're always looking. Either we have to go back to our original home or look and seek, and try to find, and usually we don't find,\" Splonskowski said. \nSome take a chance, sitting in a chair filled with the fear that an inexperienced stylist could ruin their hair. It's something Splonskowski experienced herself going to other salons in the city. “It’s kind of scary because you never know what you’re going to come out with,” Splonskowski said. \nAs Sioux Falls becomes more diverse, there's more of a need for ethnic stylists in the area. That's why Hair by Stewarts is now offering a growing variety of options for styling ethnic hair.\"We're just working hard towards making that environment change here. It's been something that Ja'Neen and I have really pushed here at Hair by Stewarts to try to make it offered to our clientele and give that broader spectrum,” Phillip Stevens, Manager, said. \nThere aren't many hair stylists who do relaxers, natural blowouts, and hair weaving here in Sioux Falls, so it's considered a specialty service at Hair By Stewarts. That means some clients will have to pay more than they would in another city. \n\"You have people that come to Chicago for example. They're use to getting their weave done for 150-bucks. $150 is my starting point just about, because we charge $100 an hour,\" Kornegay said. \nEthnic styles are being taught at local hairstyling schools so that more services can be offered here. The problem comes when students don't get enough practice on ethnic hair. \n\"You can teach a class on relaxing, but you really learn how to do relaxing truly by doing,\" Stevens said. \nStylists say anyone can style ethnic hair; it's all about having the confidence to do so. Having a nice hair style is a necessity for most women; some even say it's what makes them feel most beautiful. \n\"It's part of me, it's who I am, it's my appearance, and I'm very serious about my appearance because it says a lot about me,\" Splonskowski said. \nThe stylists here agree that ethnicity shouldn't matter when it comes to getting your hair done the way you like. They say everyone deserves to feel beautiful no matter what type of hair texture they have. \nHair stylists say they're continuing to push for more salons to cater to women of color. Stewart School of Cosmetology plans to host a class teaching students how to properly apply relaxers next month.
