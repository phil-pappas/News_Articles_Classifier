THOSE SHOES! \n\nRoads? Where we're going, we don't need roads. #BackToTheFuture #TakeTheCrown pic.twitter.com/QjrNPwPvFD \n— Jeremy Guthrie (@TheRealJGuts) October 21, 2015 The sneakers addict, er, collector has many pairs. But the Nike Air Mag that were released in 2011 have a special point of pride to him.\nThat's because he is a big Back to the Future f an and, of course, Oct. 21, 2015, had special significance in the movie.\nBack To the Future I & II were/are my fav movies ever...I have looked forward to this day for years! We finally made it! Oct 21, 2015 #MJFox \n— Jeremy Guthrie (@TheRealJGuts) October 21, 2015 So there he was wearing the shoes during Game 5 of the ALCS. Only 1,500 were made.\nThe shoes even caught the eye of MLB who tweeted about them.\nWhat are those?! #BackToTheFuture pic.twitter.com/uxUx5OgvPT \n— MLB (@MLB) October 21, 2015 On Wednesday, Nike announced a new Mag with self-tying laces would be released in the coming months. It will be a limited edition, and you can only imagine that Guthrie will get a pair of those faster than one of his fast balls.
