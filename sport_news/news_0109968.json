Elmore’s Carson and Kennedy Slates, who suffer from the disease, were on the field before the game. \nWoodmore wore purple and Genoa’s game shirts were white and purple. \nThe girls from each team were each introduced along with a member of the local U-9 or U-10 youth travel Patriots. The younger girls, along with Carson and Kennedy, also participated in the pregame warmup. \nMaddy Hines redirected a corner kick from Lily Rothert for the second goal and Hines capped the scoring early in the second half Thursday. \nWoodmore (11-1-1, 9-0) has won two of the last three conference championships. It finished second by one point last season. \n“We came back strong after a devastating loss,” Hines said of a district final setback to Archbold last season. “It shows the depth on our team. The team’s worked well together the entire season.” \nFreshman Nora LaMunyon opened the scoring about 14 minutes into the game. \n“We played good balls to the outside,” said Woodmore’s Alex Moreno, who was in goal for the shutout. “We found opportunities and finished them.” \nWoodmore advanced the the district finals each of the last three seasons. Wins like Thursday’s, as well as groups like the U-10 Patroits have Wildcats coach Jason Allen excited about both the present and future. \n“As a family, we hold each other accountable,” he said. “The talent just keeps coming.” \nmhorn@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:54:38.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
