No doubt the youngsters are ready to compete at the varsity level now. \n“This group of sophomores are some of the greatest kids I’ve ever coached,” said Bunnell, the 12th year Issaquah coach who has helped the program win three state titles and with seven of the school’s nine championship match appearances during his tenure. “We have a major discrepancy in age, with all these sophomores and seniors, and you have to find a way to make it work and get the kids to believe in each other.

These kids are like this out of the gate.” \nThe success is rooted in Bunnell’s togetherness philosophy. \n“The formula is getting along, because the season is such a short period of time,” he said. “My teams like each other. We say if you don’t someone, then fake it for three months. Then, at some point they will really like each other.” \nThe Eagles’ balance is overwhelming with seven players will three goals or more and nine players with two assists or more. Issaquah is atop KingCo 4A at 4-0-0, just ahead of Inglemoor (5-0-3 overall, 3-0-0 league) with Thursday’s home match at 7:30 p.m. against the Vikings looming. \n“I think we’re one of the better teams in the state,” Bunnell said. “We have a good mix of players coming back and some new players.” \nIssaquah has six starters back from the 2014 team, which lost 1-0 to Gig Harbor in the 4A state quarterfinals. The talented sophomore class has hiked the quality of the team considerably. \nThe Eagles have outscored opponents 36-3 so far in 10 matches with sophomores Claudia Longo (5 goals, 4 assists) and Catey Nelson (5 goals, 3 assists) leading the way. \nIt also doesn’t hurt that senior defender Kaylene Pang, a University of Washington commit, and senior goalkeeper Anna Miller are back to anchor the back line. \n“The future’s going to be insane,” Bunnell said.

He visited Utah State this weekend, Juanita coach Lele Te’o said. \n“He decided it would be a great opportunity for him and his family. It’s a great thing for our community,” Te’o said. \nGilmer has two interceptions and has caught six passes for 104 yards.
