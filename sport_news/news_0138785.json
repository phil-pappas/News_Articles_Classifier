The five-foot-10 wing is heading into her Grade 12 year with Thompson’s R.D. Parker Trojans, who Proulx led to a provincial AAA basketball championship last season. Proulx was named the most valuable player of the tournament. \n\"She’s pretty diverse and pretty talented,\" Thomas said. \"It’s a great signing for our program. In my opinion, we’re at a point now where we have to be going after the best players in the province and I think she’s definitely one of them.\" \nProulx started playing varsity basketball with the Trojans when she was in Grade 9 and was named an all-star at the AAA provincial championship tournament in that year and again when she was in Grade 10. The Trojans lost both finals. \nThomas took notice of Proulx during her Grade 9 year while he was working with a selection committee for Basketball Manitoba. It was his first summer with the Bobcats. \nHe was able to watch her first-hand for a few games the last two years as the Trojans came to the Wheat City to play in BU’s New Year’s Basketball Classic tournament and he liked what he saw. \n\"Just how she’s continued to improve,\" Thomas said. \"Her natural abilities, her athleticism and her length and height at the perimeter position is valuable and enticing. She’s pretty multi-talented and can do some different things for us. She can handle the ball, she can shoot, she can attack the rim. I think she can defend. I’m excited that she’s going to joining us.\" \nProulx, who was on Manitoba’s under-17 provincial team that won a national championship in 2014, is following in the footsteps of her current coach Sara Gillis (nee Conlin) by playing for the Bobcats. She plans to enrol in the Department of Physical Education Studies. \nThomas is relieved to not only land Proulx but also to have her commit so early. \n\"It is nice,\" he said. \"It’s one less thing to worry about and she fills that void that we’ll have in the coming years. I think it’s nice for her as well to have that decision already made, and now she can focus on her high school season and defending a provincial championship. She can also plan for the long, long term and that’s being here with the Bobcats.\" \nThe Bobcats open their regular season by hosting the Regina Cougars on Nov. 6. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:58:30.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
