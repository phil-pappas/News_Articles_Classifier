The Japanese defeated the United States of America 28-18 on Sunday in Gloucester to cap a successful tournament. Previously the Brave Blossoms had won just one match at the tournament but they have quadrupled that total after a superb showing in England where they have won the hearts of most neutrals. AJ MacGinty opened the scoring for the night with a fourth minute penalty before Kotaro Matsushima got the ball rolling with the first try of the encounter just two minutes later. Taku Ngwenya would score for the USA to put the Eagles back in the lead on 23 minutes but just four minutes later Yoshikazu Fujita was over the line and Ayumu Goromaru made it two from two to hand Eddie Jones’ charges a handy 17-8 lead at the break. The fullback also booted a three-pointed eight minutes before the interval. In the second stanza Goromaru landed an early three-pointer but was off target when attempting to convert Amanaki Mafi’s 61st minute try. Before that MacGinty landed a penalty of his own but going into the final quarter the US was trailing 25-11 and it seemed the men from the land of the rising sun would be safe. However States skipper Chris Wyles had other ideas and crossed the line on 70 minutes to give the Americans hope. MacGinty added the sundries and at 25-18 with nine minutes to play an exciting finish was on the cards. Jones’ team did not panic though and five minutes later Goromaru struck one last penalty to make it 28-18 and ensure victory for the Asian side. Japan failed to reach the quarter-finals but will feel desperately unlucky at having won three of its four pool matches, including a giant-killing victory against two-time champions South Africa, and still not going through. If they build on this foundation, they could well be handful on home turf come 2019. As for the North Americans, they leave the World Cup with four defeats from as many matches but will not feel they were disgraced save for a 64-0 defeat to the Springboks when, in their defence, coach Mike Tolkin rested several of his key players in the hope of targetting a win in their final pool match.
