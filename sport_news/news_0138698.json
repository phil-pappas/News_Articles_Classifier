I want to see it done tomorrow night. Thank you.”\nOf course, seeking comfort from Francesa is seeking McDonald’s for your new diet. It’s not going to help.\n“Will, you crying?” an incredulous Francesa, ever the charmer, offers. “Not really crying over this I hope, jeez. … That sounded scary. Will, come on. Calm down, it’s Sunday morning. He’ll be all right, jeez.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  matt harvey ,  mike francesa ,  new york mets ,  ruben tejada", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:30:19.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
