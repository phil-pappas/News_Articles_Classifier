Injuries to Joe Gomez and Danny Ings have left the club slightly undermanned. The Serbian is doing well with the Turkish club, and this may be his chance to show his talent under Klopp, who is known for his ability to get the best out of his players. \nMarkovic signed for Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers in 2014 but has failed to get a consistent run in the team, forcing the northern Irishman to send him on loan in search of more game time. However, Klopp is set to change Liverpool's style of play over the course of the next few months and the Mirror believes that he wants Markovic to be part of his system. \nKlopp started his reign at Anfield with a 0-0 draw against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. The Reds harried Mauricio Pochettino's men throughout the length of the game but failed to put the ball into the net, which should come once the system matures under his guidance. \nThe Reds are currently without Christian Benteke and Daniel Sturridge , both of whom are recovering from injury. Ings's absence has left them struggling in the striking department, with Divock Origi being given the opportunity to lead the line. \nMeanwhile, teenage midfielder Jordan Rossiter is ready to prove his worth to Klopp and get himself on the team sheet for the first team. The youngster made his debut for Liverpool as a substitute appearance against Arsenal in a 0-0 draw at the Emirates but wants a more active role in the team, which he believes can be achieved under Klopp, who has expressed a desire to work with youngsters . \n\"He's managed in the Champions League, he's won stuff with Dortmund, and I'm really looking forward to [working with] him. It's going to be a good experience,\" Rossiter told Liverpool's official website . \"I thought Brendan Rodgers was brilliant for me, he gave me my chance, over the last couple of years he put me at Melwood. \n\"I'm sure JÃ¼rgen Klopp's going to be the same, I know he's given young players a chance and it only bodes well for all the lads at the Academy and the young lads in the first team.\" More about Liverpool", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:58:07.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
