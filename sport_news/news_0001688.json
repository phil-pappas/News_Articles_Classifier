STUD: QB Matthew Stafford, Lions\nFrom dud to stud. After being benched in the third quarter last week, Stafford had by far his best performance of the season, ultimately leading Detroit to an overtime win, its first victory of the season. Stafford completed 27 of 42 passes for 405 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. He capped off the day by completing a massive 57-yard pass to Calvin Johnson to set up Matt Prater's game-winning field goal in overtime and had 33 points in standard-scoring leagues. That was 28 more points than he had last week, when he had 188 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nDUD: WR Antonio Brown, Steelers\nNobody misses Ben Roethlisberger more than Brown. Regarded as the No. 1 fantasy wide receiver entering the season, Brown has just two points on Sunday (five in full PPR leagues). The three catches for 24 yards was his least productive game of the season and comes after consecutive games of only four points in standard-scoring leagues. Brown had 56 points over the first three weeks but Roethlisberger got hurt in that third game and it has hurt Brown's production. Mike Vick has had no chemistry with him, and when Landry Jones stepped in on Sunday, he leaned on the returning Martavis Bryant.\nSHOCKER: QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, Jets\nIt doesn't appear that Fitzpatrick learned how to slide at Harvard as he continues to risk getting hurt on scrambles, but it paid off for him in the third quarter. Right after a Darrelle Revis interception, Fitzpatrick scampered for an 18-yard touchdown en route to his best performance of the year. He finished with 25 points in standard-scoring leagues, 10 more than his previous season best. Fitzpatrick completed 19 of 26 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, as modest a day through the air as he's been having all season. But suddenly running wild put him among the leaders for Week 6.\nRelated Stories Jets beat up on Washington, improve to 4-1 with 34-20 win Peyton Manning shakes off 3 more INTs, Broncos win in OT Jets 34, Washington 20: Manish Mehta's instant analysis Tags: fantasy sports , matthew stafford , antonio brown , ryan fitzpatrick", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:29:24.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
