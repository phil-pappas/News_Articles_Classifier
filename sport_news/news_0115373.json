Welcome to Hazelnut Grove", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Portland has a third organized homeless camp, this one called Hazelnut Grove, on a patchwork of public and private land in the Overlook neighborhood.\nAbout a dozen people, many who've slept at the North Portland site for months, have joined Right 2 Dream Too and Dignity Village in having a name, code of conduct, facilities such as a kitchen – and at least tacit support from City Hall.\n\"We do believe that we have some very responsible people there that want to make this work,\" Chad Stover, a policy director in Mayor Charlie Hales' office, told those gathered at an Overlook Neighborhood Association meeting Tuesday.\nThe transformation from an ad hoc collection of tents to an organized camp with specific rules took just weeks, leaving some neighbors to wonder where the spread of homeless camps will stop and when more well-to-do neighborhoods will get one.\nDana Haynes, Hales' spokesman said more camps \"certainly could\" open in other neighborhoods, but the mayor has no plan in place.\n\"I don't want to do fictional guesses about the future,\" Haynes said, adding that Hazelnut Grove, \"came along in an organic manner.\"\nThe mayor's main concern is that the campers have their basic needs met.\nCommissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees the Housing Bureau, said he is not a fan of homeless camps. But, he said, \"I'm not going to stand in the way if this is something the mayor really wants to see happen, or other members of the council\" want.\nResidents at the camp, near the intersection of North Greeley and Interstate avenues, first expressed interest in organizing last month. An adjacent nonprofit garden that works with Old Town's Sisters of the Road Café, which offers services to the homeless, offered to help.\nWeeks ago, tensions flared as the camp became bigger and more visible, and tents and trash spread across parcels owned by the state Department of Transportation, the city and Union Pacific railroad farther north. The Transportation Department issued eviction notices, and neighbors complained to the city.\nThe mayor's office asked state officials for more time, then effectively opened a city-owned lot to the campers – as long as they don't break any laws or cause other trouble. The city agreed to eventually bring in a trash bin and a portable toilet.\nMeanwhile, Portland activist Vahid Brown became the camp's liaison to the city. He posted videos from the camp, called Hales' office and the Transportation Department daily, and rallied support online. Brown also got organizing help from downtown homeless advocates and veterans of the Occupy Portland movement.\nPlease share! Governor Brown, ODOT Director Garrett - sweeps kill. This is an exercise in cruelty and the unconstitutional criminalization of homelessness. Call and demand an end to this futile practice: Gov Brown: (503) 378-4582. ODOT director Garrett: (888) 275-6368. ODOT Metro Ted Miller (503) 539-8215. #SleepNotSweeps\nPosted by Vahid Brown on Wednesday, October 21, 2015 Brown suggested a code of conduct that campers approved at a meeting Saturday.\nBy the time the state cleared campers off its nearby land this week, only two tents remained. Brown helped one person move to Hazelnut Grove. The railroad also cleared its site Oct. 9.\nThe grass-roots efforts produced a cleaner camp and a more sympathetic ear from Overlook residents. Neighbors at Tuesday's meeting had softened their tone since the association sent an angry letter to the City Council two weeks ago.\nDan Aguauyo/The Oregonian \"Not everybody in the neighborhood feels like everything that was put in that letter needed to be said,\" one woman said.\nAnother woman said the entire city needs to support the homeless, and asked when wealthier areas such as Laurelhurst, Eastmoreland and Dunthorpe will get camps.\nRaven Justice, who lives at Hazelnut Grove, told those gathered that no one at the camp wants to be there.\n\"We're sorry that we're on your doorstep,\" he said, \"but we're here, and we're trying to make the best of what we've got.\"\nA portable-toilet company visited the property Thursday, Brown said, and could deliver a city-funded toilet Saturday. Campers also raised money to pay for another toilet, he said. He said it's still unclear when the city will provide garbage service.\n-- Andrew Theen\natheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/vahidbrown/videos/10153571912056023/"], "published": "2015-10-23T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:10:32.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
