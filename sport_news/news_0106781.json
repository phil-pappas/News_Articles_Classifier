According to sources with knowledge of the deal, Portland would not have agreed to trade Morgan unless she had made her request for personal reasons.\nIn return for Morgan, Portland is set to receive Orlando’s first pick in the NWSL draft, two international slots, U.S. national team fullback Meghan Klingenberg (who’s expected to not be one of the two protected national team players from Houston) and likely Lindsay Horan as the first new allocation coming in from overseas if Horan decides to join the NWSL from PSG.\n• BIRD: FC Kansas City beats Seattle for second straight NWSL title\nMorgan, 26, is the most popular U.S. women’s player and one of the most dangerous scorers in world soccer. It’s probably a good thing for the growth of the NWSL that Morgan will go to a new market where she can help galvanize the fanbase. Meanwhile, Portland figures to remain the best-supported team in the league even if Morgan doesn’t play there.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/10/02/fc-kansas-city-tops-seattle-reign-nwsl-championship"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:44:14.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
