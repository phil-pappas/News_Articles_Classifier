(Photo: Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\nIn a series of public service announcements (PSAs) launching today on the website RISEtoWin.org , Ross himself declares, \"Sport is a common denominator in the world,\" and is followed by famous athletes reciting pieces of a pledge: \"I pledge to treat everyone with respect and dignity. I will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind. I will speak up whenever I know discrimination is happening and I will stand up, get up, rise up for victims.\"\nThe first PSAs to be beamed to large public audiences will be:\n\"Michigan PSA,\" to be shown on the giant screen at the Big House during Saturday's UM-MSU football game, will feature Tom Brady, former Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard, Fab Five basketball payer Jalen Rose and U-M football coach Jim Harbaugh. And \"NFL PSA,\" to be aired on TV during the Miami Dolphins game Sunday, also features New England Patriots and former U-M quarterback Brady, along with other pro football players -- Antonio Brown of Pittsburgh, Ryan Tannehill of Miami, DeMarcus Ware of Denver, Justin Tuck of Oakland and Broncos and Larry Fitzgerald of Arizona. An abbreviated clip of the NFL PSA was to air today on \"CBC This Morning.\" Ross, 75, the New York real estate magnate and philanthropist who has donated more then $300 million to U-M, decided to create the nonprofit RISE last year after one of his Miami Dolphins players, Richie Incognito, had ignited a scandal in 2013 by sending racist and abusive messages to a teammate.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nDolphins' Ross: It's fun to work with a guy like Suh\nGolden State Warriors forward Draymond Green.

Phillip, Associated Press)\nJocelyn Benson, dean of the WSU law school, who developed a class on race and sports at WSU back in 2007, was interviewing Ross late last year in New York, when he mentioned the RISE idea.\n\"I was immediately struck by how extraordinary it was for someone of his stature and caliber to to not just talk about, or speak out against injustice, but actually do something meaningful about it and put his money behind it,\" Benson said.\nRoss, who was born in Detroit and mentored by his late uncle, Detroit business leader and philanthropist Max Fisher, is expected to join other WSU law school alumni tonight for a reception and dinner in Detroit, and to attend the UM-MSU game in Ann Arbor Saturday.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nWoman wants apology from bullies of past\n\"Athletes, certainly in a high school or college setting, are looked up to as role models, for better or for worse,\" Benson said. \"One of the missions of RISE is to actually train and empower these athletes to be outspoken advocates for racial equality and standing up against harassment and bullying.\"\nAt the RISEtoWIN.org site, visitors can pledge to stand up against racism and speak out against discrimination. The “It Takes All Colors” photo app also allows visitors to upload a picture, apply their team colors and share it across social channels.\nTim Richey, CEO of Detroit PAL, said \"the fact that we get to be one of the first youth partners to work with RISE is really exciting.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nRealign your thinking to be a force against racism\n\"We have been training our volunteer coaches for a long time in how to use sports to build character,\" Richey added, but engaging kids to talk about race can be difficult. We know it's important and yet often it’s often the elephant in the room that nobody wants to address head-on.\"\nRISE aims to craft curricula for youth groups like Detroit PAL to use.\nContact Tom Walsh: twalsh@freepress.com, also follow him on Twitter @TomWalsh_freep", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805473410434236-Tom-Brady.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/569a42d39c144db62c2a9c58f2f6042456b8969e/c=522-0-1937-1415/local/-/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805095347483801-ThinkstockPhotos-87356500.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30a70be7f2a529398a11145869a4ecb734b37937/c=0-231-2768-3922&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805473410434236-Tom-Brady.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/08161c050b9dacd32ae86fc681a3a77e74d3df34/c=315-0-2045-1730/local/-/media/2015/03/23/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635627162010380518-MCT-SPORTS-FBN-DOLPHINS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805469904445288-Draymond-Green.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a090b0d083e42a46f7f53d3a48c6face0761cab5/r=327x400/local/-/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805469904445288-Draymond-Green.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/583a67bcfd6661ddc23b2ca7f10e8a02eb291c42/c=0-1036-4142-5178/local/-/media/2015/06/24/DetroitFreePress/B9317846647Z.1_20150624164617_000_GLGB61A4I.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f69eed9ca16aa24665ec3a43f140efb6e43326c/c=94-0-2169-2766&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805469904445288-Draymond-Green.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805473410434236-Tom-Brady.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:29:04.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
