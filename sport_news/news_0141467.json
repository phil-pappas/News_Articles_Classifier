Then I held off, so the construction just started this summer,” he says.\nKirstie Smith with the Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce says \"We've seen it all over the community, for example when Academy Sports came back to town after the tornado that area grew up around it. That area where Walmart Neighborhood Market is, needs more development there. So this is a great way for the development to be attracted to the area.”\nThis Walmart has only been open for a few days but it's parking lot is already buzzing with traffic. Many of the businesses we spoke with say they're excited to see more customers down in this area.\n\"It's definitely going to bring a lot more traffic through here, especially since a lot of people don't know about this location because we haven't been open very long,” says Worden’s Meat Cashier Sarah Alves.\nBut the business next door says Walmart has already taken over.\n\"I find it pretty excessive. Now we have four Walmarts instead of three, two pretty much Supercenters and a Neighborhood Market. I mean having four Walmarts with basically all the same things that we can get in all the other ones,” says Bamboo Chinese Take Out Cook Chris Tapia.\nJoseph says he hopes to have construction of the new strip mall on 26th street finished by the fifth anniversary of the Joplin tornado, in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:13:06.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
