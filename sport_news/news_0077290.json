(AP) - A federal agency says new fishermen costs have been pushed back a month.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said over the summer that fishermen would have to begin paying about $700 a day for nearly a quarter of their fishing days beginning on Nov. 1. That money would pay for the at-sea monitoring of fishermen, which is currently covered by the agency.\nThe Portsmouth Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/1j2laf6 ) a spokeswoman says the deadline has now been postponed to Dec. 1.\nFishermen have said the costs are too high, as they don't gross $700 in a single day.\nU.S. Rep. Frank Guinta, Sen. Kelly Ayotte and U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen have spoken out against the costs, saying it's unfair to force the industry to pay for the monitors.\nInformation from: Portsmouth Herald, http://www.seacoastonline.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1j2laf6"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:31:56.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
