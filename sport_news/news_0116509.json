Starting safety Kendrick Lewis is also dealing with a bruised knee.\n\"It was a little worse than I thought,\" said Brooks who had his hand in a cast and heavily wrapped as he watched practice. \"1/8Doctors3/8 went in and did a few things to it. ... It's something that's taken care of right now. I'm just really on the recovery process now, trying to not really think about what happened back at the last game. For the most part, we're recovering really well, and I should be back soon.\"\nBrooks didn't reveal the extent of the damage to his thumb, and he also declined to speculate on when he may return, although he said that the outlook is \"pretty good.\"\n\"This, the thumb thing, is not really a big deal,\" Brooks said. \"I hate missing time and being away from my brothers but I had knee surgery 1/8last year3/8. This is nothing compared to that. Really, I just keep on adapting to whatever happens. I'm just hopeful for no more injuries.\"\n(c)2015 The Baltimore Sun\nVisit The Baltimore Sun at www.baltimoresun.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742028", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742028&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742028&h=Ravens%27+Terrence+Brooks+has+surgical+procedure+to+repair+left+thumb"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:22:10.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
