In last season’s UEFA Champions League, Olympiacos were beaten away from home on all three occasions, relying on maximum points in Piraeus to finish third in their group. \nThis year, when they opened Group F by losing 3-0 at home to Bayern Munich, things looked bleak. However, they then won 3-2 at Arsenal and on Tuesday, Ideye’s goal helped them to a 1-0 victory at Dinamo Zagreb that moves them level with Bayern at the top. \nIdeye scored with 11 minutes left as he ran on to Felipe Pardo’s ball and squeezed his shot in from an almost impossible angle past the Dinamo keeper. \n“I tried to run quickly when I saw Pardo,” Ideye told UEFA.com. “I went for the ball. Then I managed to score a most difficult goal. That’s football. We knew we had to score. Now we’re level with Bayern and we want to make it to the next round. \n“I’m not surprised that we won hard – I expected this tough game. \n“Dinamo played a very good match. We missed some chances, they also had some chances, but we were the ones who scored. We deserved to win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:07:43.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
