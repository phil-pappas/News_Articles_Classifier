Brian Turner Perhaps it wasn’t a coincidence that Dennis Lee Olson II took “an interest in his grandmother” when she was going through a divorce, as a criminal complaint states. After splitting with her second husband a few years earlier, Betty Jane Braun was finally making it legal in 2008. The then 79-year-old made out OK in the settlement, landing assets valued at $600,000.\nSince the breakup, Braun had been living in Nevada with her son Gary Olson, Dennis’ uncle. But that June, Dennis of White Bear Lake went west to bring his grandmother to Minnesota. According to the complaint, Dennis moved the woman into an assisted living facility near his home. While Gary was surprised by the move, Braun had flashed signs of dementia and at the time there was no reason to think Dennis was a sketchball.\nWhat Gary didn’t know was that two months earlier, Dennis had opened two joint bank accounts with his grandmother. The accounts had a combined balance of more than $389,000. Dennis and his wife Melissa Olson had two accounts without Braun’s name on them, but managed under the same portfolio. By March 2011, Braun had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and Dennis had her sign papers granting him power of attorney privileges.\nAlthough Social Security was covering most of her monthly expenses, Braun’s accounts were drained to roughly $15,000 by the day she died, according to the complaint. Due to the statute of limitations, Dennis can only be charged for thefts that occurred after October 19, 2010 — five years before the complaint was filed. From then until Braun’s death, Dennis is accused of stealing more than $79,000 from one of their joint checking accounts through cash withdrawals and transfers.\n“A concern with these types of cases involving financial exploitation is that sometimes the crime is not uncovered until after it’s gone on for quite a while,” says Ross Corson, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “They use their position of trust not only to commit the crime, but also to keep it covered up. It can go on for years.”\nDennis Olson has been charged with theft by swindle, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, a $100,000 fine, or both. A court date has not yet been set.\nContact: Michael Rietmulder Follow: @mrietmulder City Pages City Pages", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/citypages", "https://twitter.com/mrietmulder", "https://www.facebook.com/citypages"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:30:09.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
