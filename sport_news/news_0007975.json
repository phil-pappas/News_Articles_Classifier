I know he has been missing in action for a very long time and he is now trying to alert people that he is still around,” he told GHANAsoccernet.com \n“I know for sure that he is using the Duncan-factor to attract attention for himself. I have never said what he is referring to on any platform. He is only seeking for attention,” he added. \nDuncan has since denied ever saying that the players recruited by his predecessors are not quality players. \nFor more Ghana football news visit www.ghanasoccernet.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:56:14.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
