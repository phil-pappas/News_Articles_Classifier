The running back from South St. Paul added to his fame Saturday, tying a career high with four touchdowns and rushing for a season-high 201 yards in a 49-27 victory over Gustavus at Clemens Stadium.\nBut Sura wasn’t a one-man show. The 14th-ranked Johnnies (5-1, 3-1 MIAC) got equally impressive performances from quarterback Nick Martin, receiver Josh Bungum and their defense as they handed the 20th-ranked Gusties (6-1, 4-1) their first loss of the season. Martin completed 11 of 16 passes for 212 yards and three touchdowns — with two of those caught by Bungum — and the St. John’s defense held the MIAC’s most powerful offense in check for much of the game.\nThe Gusties were limited to their lowest offensive totals of the season, as the Johnnies gained 489 yards to the Gusties’ 305. Gustavus entered the game averaging 54.5 points and 545 yards per game. Quarterback Mitch Hendricks, the top passer in Division III, threw for 224 yards — 110 below his season average — and three touchdowns with one interception.\nSura continued his charge up the Johnnies’ career rushing charts. He now has 38 career touchdowns, second-most in program history. His 33 carries Saturday boosted him into second place in that category with 602, and his 3,299 career rushing yards are 634 short of Tim Schmitz’s program record of 3,933.\nSt. John’s put the brakes on the Gustavus offense in a penalty-riddled first half, holding the Gusties to 96 total yards. But the Johnnies’ offense staggered, too, committing two turnovers that allowed the Gusties to take a 14-7 lead.\nA fumble on the Johnnies’ second possession of the game gave the Gusties the ball at the St. John’s 35. Leeland Lauti’s 1-yard touchdown run put Gustavus ahead 7-0 with 5:21 left in the first quarter. Sura’s first touchdown of the game — on a drive aided by a penalty for roughing the passer — tied the score with 1:09 remaining in the quarter.\nAnother Johnnies mistake early in the second quarter paved the way for the Gusties to regain the lead. St. John’s elected to punt after a drive stalled at its 28-yard line, and punter Griffin Toomey had to leap to catch a high snap. Toomey was tackled as he kicked the ball, which traveled only a few yards, and it was touched by a Gustavus player before bouncing back toward the Johnnies’ end zone. The ball was recovered by St. John’s at its 1-yard line, but officials awarded possession to the Gusties because the punt did not cross the line of scrimmage.\nHendricks hit Matt Boyce in the corner of the end zone two plays later for a 14-7 lead. But the Johnnies took charge over the final nine minutes of the half, scoring twice and staving off a late drive by Gustavus.\nThe tying touchdown came via Martin’s arm, as he completed three long passes before connecting with Josh Bungum for a 35-yard score. Sura put them ahead, amassing 58 yards during a drive that he ended with a 2-yard touchdown run. That gave the Johnnies a 21-14 lead with 39 seconds left in the half — but George Buchner’s 45-yard kickoff return started a Gusties drive that made it to the Johnnies’ 14 with 10 seconds remaining. The drive ended when Hendricks tried to thread a pass to Boyce through double coverage and was intercepted in the end zone by Carter Hanson.\nThe Johnnies scored on their first two drives of the second half to extend the lead to 35-14. Martin delivered a 29-yard touchdown pass to Bungum at 11:53 of the third quarter, and Sura ran in from three yards with 3:23 remaining in the quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:42:30.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
