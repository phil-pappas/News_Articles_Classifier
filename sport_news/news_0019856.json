The neophyte MSP contingent will row the men’s club fours with coxswain, which takes place at approximately 1:15 p.m. tomorrow.\nThe MSP crew is comprised of Trooper Pat Mahady of the Holden Barracks, who is stroking the boat; Trooper Pat Moynihan of the Crime Scene Unit in seat three; Trooper Sean Maloney, safety diver with the Underwater Rescue Unit in seat two; and Trooper Matt Davis of the State Police Academy in the bow. The history-making crew is not only trying to shake off the rust, in some cases of 20 years since they last rowed, but also are giving up a decade or more, in some cases, to their rivals in the 55-team event.\nThe immediate goal is to have fun. The long-term plan is to expand the State Police Rowing program while spreading the “Learn to Row” message to youth across Massachusetts. New Balance has provided racing singlets, while Northeastern rowing coach John Pojednic has offered use of a Husky racing shell.\n“For this year, honestly, we’re just excited to be part of it,” said 31-year-old Mahady, a former four-time NU letter-winner (2003-2007) in crew. “A lot of the other crews have been training all year, and with our crazy schedules we’ve been training for about a month. I haven’t rowed competitively for a decade.\n“This year, the state police celebrates its 150th anniversary and it’s the first time we have a boat entered in the Head of the Charles,” said Mahady. “My idea always was to someday have a boat in the (regatta). So it really will be something to have a state police boat entered in such an international event.”\nMaloney, the self-described “old dude” in the boat at a spry 43, is a former UMass-Lowell rower, who last competed in the Head in 1994 with the Merrimack River Rowing Association Club 4s.\nOlympian: Head of the Charles will be ‘one big party on the bank’ Photo Gallery: Mass. State Police practice for practice for the Head of the Charles Regatta “I haven’t sat in a boat in 20 years. It’s a little different,” he said. “It’s a unique experience in trying to get a boat up to speed for an event like the Head of the Charles.\n“We want to represent the state police in the best fashion we can. This a trial balloon for the State Police Rowing program, to get it up and running. We’ve got about 15 other state police that have interest in taking part in offseason training.”\nMaloney credit Chris Maietta, the founding father of the Wayland-Weston youth rowing program, with coming up with the idea for the State Police Rowing program from a casual conversation he had with two on-duty officers at the 2013 Head. Maietta contacted Sgt. Thomas Ryan to get the word out. Former Rollins College rower Shayne Rowan, the W-W assistant novice boys coach, has offered coaching advice. Inna Oh, a Noble & Greenough senior, has volunteered to serve as coxswain.\n“I’m really impressed,” said Maietta. “All four of the guys are really diligent and disciplined, which is what you’d expect from the state police organization. They haven’t rowed in years, but they’re working so hard.\n“For the time that we’ve been on the water, which is about three weeks, they’ve done really well. . . . They have an amazing coxswain and they trust her, which is huge. As state police, they’re so focused and determined too.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:38:11.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
