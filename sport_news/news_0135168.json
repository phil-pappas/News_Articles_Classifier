Now, Yahoo has done away with the password altogether in its new Yahoo Mail app, instead asking users to sign in via push notification. \nThe new app uses new sign-in method Yahoo Account Key, which sends a notification to the smartphone you've chosen to link to the account asking 'Are you trying to sign in?' and the option to select yes or no. \nYahoo claims the feature is more secure than a traditional password due to the second step of phone verification, but without the need to input a code. Fast. Beautiful. Intuitive. The all-new @YahooMail app is out today! Try it out and let us know what you think: http://t.co/xeSylM604m . â€” marissamayer (@marissamayer) October 15, 2015 \nIf your phone is stolen or lost, verification notifications can instead be sent to other linked email accounts and phone numbers. \nHowever, if you feel more comfortable entering a password in the traditional sense, the company has provided users with the option to revert. \nThe new service is not the first time Yahoo has experimented with password replacement. Earlier this year Yahoo introduced On-Demand Passwords, a feature which sent a generated password directly to your phone for a one-time log in. \nThe death of the password is a concept many in the technology industry have been exploring for years. PayPal is working on a new generation of embeddable, injectable and ingestible devices that could replace passwords as a means of identification, and biometric identification via selfies is set to kill off passwords altogether within five years, according to Mastercard. \nYahoo Mail is available to download on iOS and Android . \nYahoo executives also announced how Yahoo Mail had been revamped to allow users to connect with, manage and search Outlook, Hotmail and AOL email accounts while signed in to their Yahoo account. \nThe new Mail also connects to Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook to add photos and create \"contact cards\" with email, telephone and social media information for contacts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:09:00.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
