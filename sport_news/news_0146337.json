To have something like this happen that spans so many years, that takes a lot. It really does. It's quite impressive.\" \nThing is, the Wildcats (2-3, 1-1) didn't seem to care about any of it. They clearly didn't get the memo that this was supposed to be a celebratory night for the Spartans. \nMidway through the second quarter, Dominic Nadz scored his second rushing touchdown of the night, a 2-yard plunge, and followed with the two-point conversion run as JC took a 16-15 lead with 6 minutes, 7 seconds left in the first half. \nAs one might expect from a squad so used to winning, the Spartans (5-0, 2-0) answered immediately. \nIt started with and 81-yard drive that took seven plays. \nQuarterback Kyle Balmer raced for 26 yards on a keeper left on the first play. A play later, Cerra scooted 19 yards around the left side. Cerra finished the march on a 16-yard scoring run around the left end, beating Nadz to the corner of the end zone. Balmer's two-point run made it 23-16, 3:37 before halftime. \nJC went three-and-out on its next possession and M-E took over at its 19 with about 1:30 left in the half. \nAided by a 15-yard pass interference penalty — one of 16 flags for 155 yards against JC — the Spartans drove to JC's 15, calling timeout with 17.4 seconds left in the half. \nBalmer then rolled left and threw a strike to Drew Gallagher, who somehow managed to keep a foot inbounds as he caught the dart on the left sideline, about a yard deep into the end zone. Cerra's two-point run gave the Spartans a 31-16 halftime lead. \n\"Their quarterback made a great play,\" JC coach Fred Deinhardt said. \"As a coach, you don't want to give up a score just before halftime.\" \nThis one was all but sealed when M-E drove 65 yards for a score, a drive that bridged the third and fourth quarters. Fullback Scott Clark, subbing for the injured Cordell Woolfolk, had the big play, a 25-yard run up the gut on which he dragged several JC defenders along the way. Clark, a bruising 5-foot-11, 229-pounder, finished with 23 carries for a game-high 133 yards. \n\"Scotty played fantastic,\" said M-E coach Matt Gallagher, adding he expects Woolfolk to be ready this coming week against Syracuse Corcoran. \"It's next man up. That's another thing about this streak, we've had some major injuries, but guys step up.\" \nMicah Miller capped it by running through one tackle attempt after receiving an option pitch from Balmer en route to a 21-yard scoring run along the left sideline. Balmer's two-point pass to Gallagher made it 39-16, with 9:59 left. Thereafter, JC's Kenny Johns hauled a perfectly thrown ball from Jake Thompson on a 51-yard scoring play, Cerra had a 5-yard touchdown run for M-E, and Thompson capped the Wildcats' final drive with a 1-yard scoring run. \nM-E's 56-game streak broke a tie with a Massena squad that went 54-0-1 over a 9-year span, a streak that ended in 1957. \n\"Obviously, consistency has to be the word,\" Gallagher said. \"We've had players consistent in what they do and that allows to have a streak that lasts for five years.\" \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob 182 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1RlPAUT TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T04:45:01.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
