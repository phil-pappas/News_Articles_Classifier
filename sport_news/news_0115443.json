The Panthers head to Dallas for a rematch with the surging Stars, who have won five in a row. They may be without top-line center Aleksander Barkov, who sustained an upper-body injury in the first period when blocking a shot.\nFor a while Tallon certainly didn't get much respect from the referees in his hometown. The penalty calls were lopsided for most of the game as at one juncture the Blackhawks had six power plays (8 total) to the Panthers' one.\nTied at 1 after the first period, the Panthers gave the Blackhawks two consecutive power plays in the first 3:33. That was one too many after defenseman Steve Kampfer went off with a hook, Seabrook's dipping slapper from just inside the blue line deflected off the stick of former Blackhawks center Dave Bolland and Roberto Luongo's glove for a 2-1 lead at 3:51.\nThe Panthers nearly replied on their next rush, however, Corey Crawford made a sprawling glove save to stone Jaromir Jagr. Still, despite being outshot 21-9 after two, the Panthers only trailed 2-1 heading into the third.\nThe Panthers were shorthanded for 7:36 of the middle frame and it carried over for 42 seconds of the third period. Kane, the overall No. 1 draft pick by Tallon in 2007, needed just 17 seconds to lift a backhander over Luongo for his fifth goal of the season and a 3-1 lead.\nPerhaps the referees felt unfair as they handed out a four-minute penalty to Marcus Kruger and then just six seconds later got Niklas Hjalmarsson for a delay of game. With 10 ticks left on the 5-on-3 advantage, Jagr tapped in a rebound of Vincent Trocheck's shot to make it a one-goal deficit with 12:36 left.\nIt was Jagr's team-leading fifth goal, his 727th career goal and his 206th power-play goal to move him past Joe Sakic into 13th place all time. Hihs 588th power-play point tied him with Teem Selanne for third place in the history books.\nAfter two straight losses Panthers coach Gerard Gallant felt it was time to do some tinkering with his lineup.\nSo Gallant flopped his right wings, Trocheck and Reilly Smith, on the second and third lines to bolster the offense, and replaced rookie defenseman Alex Petrovic after a subpar game in this week's 3-2 loss to the Penguins with Kampfer, who had a forgettable season debut.\nBlackhawks forward Artem Anisimov swooped around a flat-footed Kampfer and then Dmitry Kulikov before flicking it in at 4:02 of the first period. Just 34 seconds later, Trocheck who was promoted to the second line with Nick Bjugstad and Brandon Pirri, took turns poking at a loose puck in the crease before jabbing it in.\nTrocheck notched his first point and goal since notching a goal and three assists in the season opener.\n\"Last year Kampfer played real well and hadn't had a chance to play this year,\" Gallant said earlier. \"There was some things I didn't like but 1/8Petrovic3/8 has played good overall for six games.\"\nLoungo's sterling glove save on a point-blank shot from Jonathan Toews kept the Panthers tied at 1 after the first period despite getting outshot 12-4. ...\n\"I'm proud in what we did as a staff in Chicago to make something special here,\" Tallon said before the game. \"We're kind of mirroring Chicago a little bit; it's getting there. We've got 10 draft picks on the team right now and the goal is to get 15. ... The future looks really good.\"\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742078&h=Blackhawks+power+past+Panthers%2C+3%2D2", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742078", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742078&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:12:28.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
