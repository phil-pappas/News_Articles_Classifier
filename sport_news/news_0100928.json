Should the village choose to build a new facility, four options were presented , including a new plant on the existing location on Glencoe Beach, building one either to the north or the south of the current site or converting the existing public works garage on Village Court into a water treatment plant. All of these options would cost tens of millions of dollars.\nSo as village officials continue to study the issue, the Historic Preservation Commission is stating a preference to keep the existing building in place.\n\"We would like to keep the exterior of the building as it is,\" commission Chairman Tom Scheckelhoff said. \"It has some significance in Glencoe. It is part of the set piece of the other elements on the beach. We would like to see it kept.\"\nScheckelhoff said a formal letter expressly stating that preference is being prepared and he anticipates sending it to the village sometime in the next few weeks.\nMeanwhile, over at the Park District, commissioners in August passed a resolution essentially reminding the public the two agencies are separate.\n\"The Glencoe Park District Board recognizes the value of the Glencoe Beach to its residents and continuously strives to be a good steward of this important lakefront asset. The Board also recognizes it is an independent unit of local government created for specific purposes under the Illinois Park District Code,\" the resolution read in part. \"While the Park District endeavors to work cooperatively with its sister Glencoe public entities, it understands its paramount responsibility is to preserve and protect the properties under its auspices which are dedicated to community park and recreation services.\"\nSome of that property likely to be considered to construct a new plant adjacent to the current location is owned by the park district. Therefore, some type of agreement would have to be made between the two bodies.\nVillage President Larry Levin said the moves by the other bodies represent part of the process; he does not expect a final decision on the water supply situation for one to two years.\n\"We expect all sorts of people to have thoughts and suggestions, and we are in the process of gaining all of that,\" Levin said. \"That is why we want to go back to the community. As part of the education process, we are going to make all of this available and see what the public has to say.\"\nThe village could also opt not to build a new build a new plant. Another option presented in the March report was to purchase water either temporarily or on a permanent basis from Highland Park.\nLevin said that on top of the options already on the table, village staff is continuing to seek out other ideas for its long-term water supply needs.\nOne other moving part in this situation is whether an alliance can be formed between Glencoe and the Northwest Water Commission, which supplies water to Arlington Heights, Buffalo Grove, Palatine and Wheeling.\nIn the past, the NWC – which gets its water from Evanston – has expressed interest in developing a second supply source, which is the reason for the interest in a possible relationship with Glencoe. The NWC and Glencoe have had discussions in the past about a joint venture, but an assessment from the NWC on their own needs has yet to be presented.\nDaniel I.
