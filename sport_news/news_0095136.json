Now they have to get healthy.\nChase Headley and Jacoby Ellsbury both with back issues, sat out Thursday’s 4-1 playoff-clinching win over the Red Sox.\nEllsbury was still feeling the effects of crashing into the wall trying to make a catch in Wednesday’s loss, while Headley’s back “locked up,” according to Girardi.\n“It’s not a big deal,” Headley said. “It’s just been a long stretch. The field has been a little bit harder than normal … and it just got a little tight [Wednesday] night. … It could be a day. We don’t want it to be a week.”\nWith the playoffs looming (the Yankees need to win the wild-card game Tuesday before the ALDS comes into focus), the scheduling could benefit healing.\n“I hope the day off helps them,” Girardi said. “The thing about the playoffs, you don’t play 17 days in a row. From a physical standpoint, it’s a lot easier around the playoffs.”\nHeadley has been waiting his entire career for the opportunity.\n“It felt like a few weeks we were trying to clinch, even if it was just a couple of days,” Headley said. “I’ll tell you what an eternity is: Parts of nine seasons. That’s what I’ve dealt with. Expectations in New York are to win a championship every year and that’s why I came here.”\nAdam Warren threw three shutout innings to get to Dellin Betances, who closed it out in the ninth for his ninth save of the season.\n“[Warren’s] value is as big as any pitcher in that room,” Girardi said. “Every good team I’ve been on has a guy like Warren. I first saw it here with Ramiro Mendoza.”\nWarren will be available out of the bullpen for Tuesday’s wild-card game, but Girardi didn’t rule out starting him in the playoffs.\n“I’m not worried about starting or relieving,” Warren said. “I’m just taking it one day at a time.”\nThe wild-card game will be a first for the Yankees, who became the second franchise to reach 10,000 wins on Thursday, joining the Giants.\n“We’ll try to formulate the roster as well as we can,” Girardi said. “It could very well be similar to [Wednesday] night. You’ve got to win that game. There is no tomorrow.”\nLuis Severino is scheduled to pitch in Baltimore on Friday, but Girardi doesn’t have his rotation set.\n“We’ve got to talk about how to do this,” Girardi said. “It’s still important that we have home-field advantage, but not at the expense of being not prepared Tuesday.”\nModal Trigger Playoff-bound Yankees' next goal: Get healthy quick Posted: October 2, 2015 View Thumbnails Previous Next Advertisement Dellin Betances and John Ryan Murphy jump for joy as the Yankees clinch.
