(Photo: Brian Powers/The Register)\nLUBBOCK, Texas — Some people say this is one of the few remaining games Iowa State can win, mentioning Red Raiders in the same breath as Longhorns and possibly Wildcats.\nThat’s why winning Saturday’s 2:30 p.m. game in Lubbock is so important for a program that seeks consecutive Big 12 Conference wins for the first time since beating Kansas and West Virginia at the end of 2013.\nIt’s not a great Texas Tech team (3-2) that the Cyclones face. It’s actually their scheduling appetizer before facing TCU and Baylor on successive Saturdays.\nStory lines? Here’s a few:\nIowa State must be patient\nTexas Tech will score; the Red Raiders own the best passing offense in the country, at 423.8 yards a game. They’ll probably even score on their first possession – they usually do.\nBut Iowa State needn’t get flustered, because Texas Tech is prone to making mistakes.\nYou think Iowa State’s 14 penalties against Toledo were a lot? They were, but get this:\nThe Red Raiders committed 17 in last Saturday’s 63-35 loss at Baylor. The offensive line was flagged for seven penalties: four for illegal procedure, two for holding and one for illegal receiver downfield.\nNo missed tackles\nAgainst Kansas, Iowa State could afford to miss a tackle or two. Against Texas Tech? Not so much.\nThe Red Raiders thrive on having sprinter receivers turn medium-range passes into long gains with their shiftiness and their where-are-they-now elusiveness.\nThe same is true against quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who can turn a bad play or two into something big.\nIn the past, this has been the Cyclones’ bugaboo; tackling hasn’t always been the defense's strong suit. But with guys like Jay Jones and Demond Tucker and more experienced players in the secondary, that aspect of the game might be better on this occasion.\nThe burgeoning freshman running back opens up a lot of opportunities for Iowa State's offense Randy Peterson\nKeep drives alive\nThe best way to keep the second-best Big 12 quarterback (behind TCU’s Trevone Boykin) from striking early and often is to keep him on the sidelines. You can’t throw touchdown passes when you’re can’t throw.\nTurning this offense that averages 602.8 yards a game into spectators as long as possible — that’s the best way to beat these guys.\nCyclone tight ends caught three passes against Kansas — the first receptions for that position group this season. Ben Boesen and Justin Chandler must catch more, because it’s not like they need to be held back to block — Texas Tech has sacked quarterbacks just three times in five games.\nInvolving the tight ends will help free standout tailback Mike Warren, as well as create opportunities for receivers.\nFreshman running back Mike Warren talks about moving forward after two breakout games. Tommy Birch\nAnd speaking of Warren\nThis could be an even bigger day for the redshirt freshman, who rushed for 175 yards last Saturday against Kansas. He’ll be facing a defense against whom opponents have averaged 277.4 rushing yards a game — the worst rush defense in the Big 12.\n“I know I can do better,” Warren said after his breakout game against the Jayhawks.\nFor the Cyclones to win, that confidence must show up Saturday, not only with Warren, but also the offensive line that plows his path.\nBig game for quarterback Sam?\nIt could happen, considering Texas Tech not only has the worst rush defense in the Big 12, but also has sacked quarterbacks just three times in five games.\nArmchair quarterbacks figure that is what has been keeping Richardson from that big senior breakout. He’s been sacked 14 times, which can lead to happy feet when he senses pressure coming from all directions, but so far, he’s been relatively healthy throughout this frontal and blindside attacking.\nSo if receivers can get open, Saturday could be Sam’s day.\nCyclone sports columnist Randy Peterson has been reporting on ISU during the past five decades.
