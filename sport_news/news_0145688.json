LIEB\nAssociated Press COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Crumbling roads, bridges and dams and aging drinking water systems plagued South Carolina long before the historic floods of the past week.\nNow the state that has refused to raise taxes to pay for infrastructure faces hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars' worth of additional bills to fix or replace key pieces of it.\nIt will take weeks or months to document the full extent of the damage, and to find out how much federal aid is coming South Carolina's way.\nBut the federal government isn't going to pay for all the repairs as northeastern states learned in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.\nEven before the flood, the South Carolina Legislature couldn't agree on a plan to raise the gas tax for the first time since 1987.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
