Lakers point guard D’Angelo Russell, the second overall pick in the draft, hit three jumpers during a 2-minute span — the last one with 1:28 remaining to give the Lakers a 98-89 cushion. Portland responded with a 13-4 run, tying the score on a 3-pointer by Pat Connaughton with 4.8 seconds to go. Kelly took Jabari Brown’s inbounds pass from the left sideline and soared over Noah Vonleh for the winning points. Portland’s last gasp was a missed 20-footer at the buzzer by Vonleh off an inbounds pass from Omari Johnson. “It’s disappointing to lose it that way, when we had come back and made some great plays that put ourselves in a position to win,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. “I feel better about that, than if we had lost by 10. But I look at the game more in total than just the ending, since it’s a preseason game.” Jordan Clarkson led the Lakers with 17 points and Damian Lillard 20 for Portland.
