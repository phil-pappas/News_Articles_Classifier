He then moved to Omaha and added state championships in Nebraska. \n“It was nice for me because the greens were so small,’’ Rose said of SCC. “It really forced me to work on my short game and save pars, which helped me competitively. Some of those shots that are part of the short game are not easy to practice.’’ \nRose offered recollections this week with Shawnee Country Club observing its 100th anniversary. \nA front nine opened in 1915 and nine additional holes were added in 1921. A complete 18-hole course was routed from the outset by one of golf’s most renowned architects, Donald Ross. \n“There’s just something about Ross’ routing that is really good, especially since he did a lot of it just on topographic maps,’’ said Ron Whitten, a former SCC member who is the longtime architecture editor for Golf Digest. ”He didn’t go to every course he laid out. Now I did run across a newspaper article where he did come through Topeka.’’ \nOne of the best examples of topographical fit at SCC, Whitten said, was the design applied to holes No. 9-12. The stretch, consisting entirely of par-4s, is considered the toughest on the course. \nAs a competitor, Rose looks back at that four-hole swing as a foundation for his game. \n“It really forced me to play long par-4s,’’ he said. \nOne of Rose’s triumphs in the Kansas Amateur came at Shawnee Country Club in 1975. He claimed medalist honors in qualifying for the 64-man bracket, then defeated Paul Anderson in the final. \n“One of the interesting things was the greens were usually slow at Shawnee,’’ Rose said. “I did not mind going to faster greens, though. It was better than the reverse, because when you went to slower greens it seemed as if you had to slug putts, which is never good. In that 1975 Amateur, though, the greens were quick, but I was actually ready for quicker greens.’’ \nRose, who now lives in Texas, has been a longtime course ranking panelist for Golf Digest. Legendary Capital-Journal columnist Bob Hentzen, who was also a longtime SCC member, recommended Rose for that position. Ever since, Rose has traveled the world rating courses, and played most of Ross’ designs. \nShawnee Country Club will be the site of a tournament Friday, sponsored by GreatLife Golf and Fitness to observe the 100th anniversary of the course. A full field of 108 players is entered. \nAny celebration to SCC’s past begins in the front foyer of the clubhouse. \nFormer state amateur champions such as Rose and Tillie Becker are recognized, along with club standouts Bill Hentzler, Glen Dillon, Harry Wilson and Jack Caldwell. Ray Streeter, the former club pro at Topeka Public (now Cypress Ridge), is even pictured as one of the state’s rising youth golfers in a 1952 photo. Ed Skradski, former president of and executive secretary of the Kansas Golf Association, is also recognized. \nAnother treat is a write-up of a 1951 benefit event to help flood victims, with a picture of Becker alongside Hollywood legends Bob Hope and Danny Kaye. After claiming the Kansas Women’s Amateur one year, Becker played a match against the men’s state champ, Dave Dennis of Independence. \n“It’s a gem,’’ said head professional Joey Martinak, who is in his 20th year at SCC. “I see good things in the future too.’’ \nThe course approaches 30,000 rounds played in a year, Martinak said, compared to about 18,000 before GreatLife purchased the property. The men’s club routinely draws 90 participants and was even extended four weeks this year at the desire of golfers involved. \nWhile the course has drawn criticism for its condition, which had begun to erode prior to its purchase by GreatLife, improvements are planned. \nAccording to Martinak, all fairways are scheduled to be stripped with zoysia by April. Additional work has already begun on the bunkers. Some clubhouse renovations have also been outlined. \n“One reason I’ve remained a member here is because it’s a Donald Ross course and I love the design,’’ said Mark Stevens, a retired Army colonel who lives in Topeka and was an SCC member before GreatLife took ownership. “These greens are as good as they’ve been in 10 years. You can hit putts firm now and they’ll hold the line.’’ \nAlthough some greens and holes have been modified over the years, some of those lines remain connected to the vision Ross sketched 100 years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:05:07.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
