Derek Falvey will preplace Chernoff. He has been the club's director of baseball operations. \nThe team said the moves will not impact business operations with owner Paul Dolan assuming Shapiro's responsibilities. Dolan said the club's front-office structure is similar to one adopted recently by several other teams. \nThe Indians finished 81-80 and missed the playoffs for the second straight year. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:59:34.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
