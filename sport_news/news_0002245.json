They are members of our families. As familiar as we are with our own dogs and cats, there is much information about pets in general and about animal shelters that is not common knowledge. Here are just a few examples:\n• Sixty-eight percent of all U.S. households have a pet: 57 percent have dogs; 45 percent have cats.\n• Only 10 to 20 percent of cats and dogs are adopted from shelters and rescues. The majority of pets are received from acquaintances and family.\n• Between 9 million and 12 million cats and dogs enter shelters each year: 3 million to 4 million find adoptive homes.\n• Top three reasons why dogs are surrendered to shelters: moving, landlord issues and cost of pet.\n• Top three reasons why cats are surrendered to shelters: too many cats, allergies and moving.\n• Twenty-five percent of dogs in shelters are purebred.\n• Chatham County has a serious pet overpopulation problem. No accurate figures exist for percentage of pets sterilized.\n• A female cat can have a litter when she is only 6-and-a-half-months old. Gestation is only six weeks. In warm climates, cats can have as many as four or five litters each year. Litters average four to six kittens.\n• Dogs can have as many as two litters each year. An average litter is four to six puppies.\n• A litter can have multiple fathers.\n• Studies show that $1 spent on sterilization now saves $3 in impound costs in three years.\n• Sterilized pets tend to live longer and have fewer behavioral problems than unaltered pets.\nLocally, pet overpopulation is such a serious problem that HSGS is taking action to provide a solution: Pet Fix Savannah, our community, low-cost spay and neuter clinic. This week the foundation was poured and the building should be in place before the month is over. Please follow us on Facebook for updates.\nAnd, when you consider adding a four-legged member to your family, please think about all those pets who through no fault of their own, are living in a shelter. Here at the Humane Society for Greater Savannah, our staff can help identify a cat or dog well suited to you and your life style. Start by going to our website www.HumaneSocietySAV.org to see who’s available for adoption. Then, pay us a visit and find your new best friend.\nLynn Gensamer is the executive director of Humane Society for Greater Savannah.
