They've had a good start and we've had a disaster.\n\"Over the past 12 months we've had to manage a lot of change and a lot of disruption. I respect the booing. There is frustration when you don't win the game. You have to take it on the chin as manager and players. Winning games is key to having support — it's not about me, it's about supporting the team. It's still very early in the season.\n\"There's lot of improvement still to come. If we go into the Everton game as favorites it shows we're a big club. We're happy to have that here. The level of our opponent's game always goes up. It's another opportunity to get a victory. We respect that it will be a tough game. It's one we want to win for our supporters.\"\nThursday's Europa League home game with Sion was deemed as an opportunity to get a second straight win to ease pressure on Rodgers' position, but the Reds ended up drawing 1-1 — much to the chagrin of their coach.\n\"We go into Sunday's game with confidence. We have quality in this team, we should have won that game last night 4-1,\" he added. \"We're not giving away many opportunities but we're getting punished for mistakes. We need to cut out those mistakes.\"\n\"You can see the team is starting to evolve. We are creating a lot of chances. Now we need to start taking them. It's a huge game.\"\nDaniel Sturridge was rested for the draw with Sion as he continues to work his way back to full fitness and Rodgers suggested he'd be back in his XI against Everton, while Christian Benteke remains a major doubt.\n\"With so many games we have to make sure we look after Daniel Sturridge,\" he added. \"He's fresh and fit and looking forward to this weekend.\"\n\"You saw in the game last week Daniel's quality. He's so important for us. Top players give a team confidence. He has star quality.\n\"Otherwise, there's no real change with injuries. We're seeing how Benteke is over course of next 24 hours. Squad will be pretty much the same as the Villa game.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:32:29.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
