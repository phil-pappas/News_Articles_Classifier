Evangel (7-1, 4-0) punished the Vikings’ early mistakes and never let a vaunted offensive line find its footing in a 37-7 rout, the Eagles’ smallest margin of victory through four District 1-5A games. \n“The one thing I did was challenge our defense, and those guys really stepped up to the challenge,” Coach Byron Dawson said. “I’m just so proud.” \nTotal domination up front from Evangel’s young defense makes one wonder just how high the ceiling might be for a group of primarily sophomores who seem to accomplish amazing new feats every week. This time, they held the district’s leading rusher, Shun’Cee Thomas to -5 yards on eight carries while limiting a powerful offense to by far its lowest score of the year for the third time this season. \nThe Eagles probably deserved a shutout, but Cameron Howell denied them with a remarkable, one-handed catch in between three defenders before going the rest of the way for an 85-yard touchdown. Sophomore defensive linemen Micah Baskerville said the Eagles’ defensive success comes from just having fun while giving maximum effort, and he praised the leadership of senior linebacker AC Gilliam. \n“I look up to him a lot,” Baskerville said. “We just go over drills after school and we watch film together. He shows me what to watch for and what not to do.” Gilliam leads Evangel defense into another tough test \nDawson said that veteran presence can be just as valuable in the offensive huddle for an Evangel team not as reliant on the pass as most of its predecessors. Gilliam added an extra dose of athleticism to a backfield led by Jamarquez Mims, who ran for 167 yards on just 13 carries. \nThe senior said he loves having Gilliam on his side, and it proved especially effective on a night when wet balls made passing difficult. Mims also credited his offensive line, and Dawson said the group of Ethan Harvey, Cameron Davis, Tanner Coleman, Carson Faulk and Alvin Ford may be the district’s unsung heroes. \nThey paved the way against an Airline defense consistently left in awful positions by an impotent offense and critical special teams mistakes. Two snaps over the head of punter Bryce Bailey in the first quarter set up short touchdown drives to dig a hole far too deep for the Vikings, who still have a lot to prove against Byrd and Parkway to close out the season. \n“We knew when we made those mistakes it obviously was going to be difficult to overcome,” coach Bo Meeks said. “Against a defense like that, to try to come back from 20-0 is obviously going to be challenging, but our guys fought all night.” \nOnly two more opponents stand between Evangel and another outright title after its 68th straight district win at home. Defending champion Byrd figures to offer the biggest challenge in the season finale Nov. 5 at Lee Hedges Stadium in what’s shaping up to be a spectacular showdown if both teams are healthy. 3 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/2015/10/24/another-rout-moves-evangel-closer-crown/74517122/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:30:23.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
