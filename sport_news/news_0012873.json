(Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette) Most Popular October 23, 2015 | 10:34 pm \nTIPTON — Mount Vernon’s Drew Adams threw an incompletion on his first pass attempt. \nThe sophomore quarterback didn’t miss many after that. \nAdams threw for 284 yards and a season-best five touchdowns to lead the Mustangs to an impressive 44-7 road win at Tipton Friday night to clinch second place in Class 2A, District 4. \nMount Vernon will host a first round playoff game on Wednesday night. \n“Home-field advantage is very important for us,” Mount Vernon Coach Lance Pedersen said. “Our kids put us in a position to do that today and I’m excited for what we call the new season. Our goal right now is to be 1-0 next week.” \nThe Mustangs (7-2, 5-1) racked up 547 total yards — the bulk of it in the first three quarters. \nAdams completed 16 of his next 18 passes after that first miss, connecting on 11 straight at one point. Adams finished 21 of 26 with no interceptions and TD passes to four different receivers. \nMount Vernon jumped to a 7-0 lead on its second series of the game and never stopped. \nAdams connected with receiver Connor Herrmann for TD passes of 16 and 14 yards in the second quarter to push the lead to 19-0. \nLater in the quarter, Adams underthrew a deep ball to Jake Randall, but the Tipton defender slipped as the ball arrived. Randall caught it and easily turned up field for a 39-yard score. \n“Our offense continues to move along and move forward,” Pedersen said. “We have a lot of different weapons. That’s fun and that’s exciting.” \nMount Vernon’s Jack Cochrane rushed for 119 yards and two touchdowns. Cochrane also caught a 12-yard TD. \nTipton quarterback Adam Hermsen ran for a 16-yard touchdown in the second quarter for the Tigers’ lone score. \nTipton (7-2, 4-2) finished third in the district and will travel for a playoff game Wednesday.
