(Photo: Lance Iversen-USA TODAY Sports) 22 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSome Wolf Pack football fans might have mailed in the season after Nevada’s home loss to UNLV. \nOthers might have mailed in the season after the road loss at previously winless Wyoming. \nBut the Wolf Pack football team has two messages for its fans as it prepares to host Hawaii at 1 p.m. Saturday: (1) We’re disappointed by the last month of the season, too; (2) Don’t give up on us because there’s plenty of season left, five games to be exact. \n“We’re working. Have faith,” running back Don Jackson said of his message to fans. “My hat’s off to the people that really stick it out with us. There’s up and downs in a season. That’s all over the country. Team are having ups and downs and we’re one of those teams right now. Everybody who thinks the season is dead or we don’t have anything in front of us, they’re crazy. I’d rather them not be cheering for me. That’s just how I feel. \n“I want those people who understand and are really looking at the big picture and the big picture is we can still do some great things and I appreciate those people who are on the ride with us.” \nLenny Jones, who like Jackson is a senior and team captain, said he understands why fans would be upset with the team, which is 3-4 overall and 1-2 in the Mountain West. Nevada has been a betting-line favorite in all three of its MW games, but has lost two stunners, first to UNLV and then to Wyoming. \n“We’re on the same page,” Jones said. “We’re upset more than they are. Two losses that we’ve had of late is really disappointing to me as a senior because that’s not how I envisioned my season and our season to go. I don’t think anybody is more upset than me and our teammates. Just continue to support us and if we go 1-0 at the end of each week for the next five weeks that will have us in the conference championship. You never know what happens, but it starts with one this Saturday.” \nThe issue last Saturday at Wyoming, other than poor fundamental play on offense and defense, was a lack of energy, coach Brian Polian said. Polian has been critical of himself, his assistant coaches and his players coming off the 28-21 loss to Wyoming, which he said “at times was embarrassing.” \nThe Wolf Pack players said all last week they respected Wyoming and didn’t look at the team’s 0-6 record. But this week, Nevada admitted it overlooked Wyoming. They said they won’t do the same against Hawaii, which is 2-5 overall, 0-3 in the MW and has struggled on offense and defense. \n“Coach Polian stressed, ‘Don’t take this team for granted,’” Lane said of the Wyoming preparation. “We just didn’t want to believe that it was true. We could say, ‘OK. We hear you,’ but through our actions and how we played we didn’t believe a word he was saying. We thought we could go out there and just roll it out. That’s something you can’t do.” \nWOLF PACK HOMECOMING WEEK \nNevada will hold its third annual March from the Arch on Friday as part of homecoming week. \nFood trucks, a dance performance and the Wolf Pack marching band will play downtown from 6-7:45 p.m. before Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve and UNR president Marc Johnson speak at 7:45 p.m. The Reno arch will turn blue around 8 p.m. before the march from downtown Reno to UNR’s campus. \nAt 8:45 p.m., a pep rally, with food trucks, carnival booths and fireworks, will be held at UNR before Polian speaks to the crowd. The goal of the March to the Arch is to connect downtown with campus. \n“The March from the Arch is very cool,” Polian said. “I’m going to be at the pep rally in the quad. That’s what makes college football great. Frankly, I’m a sucker for it. That’s why I’ve been at this level the whole time.” \nWith a 1 p.m. kickoff and good weather forecasted, Nevada is hopeful for a big homecoming crowd. \n“I know it’s going to be a great atmosphere and I just want my guys to take advantage of it,” said Jackson, who plays his penultimate game at Mackay. “If we take advantage of it, it will be a great night.” \nNEVADA PREPS FOR TWO QBs \nHawaii’s starting quarterback, Max Wittek, a transfer from USC, missed the team’s game last week with a knee injury but has returned to practice and is probable to play Saturday against the Wolf Pack. \nNevada is preparing for both Wittek and Ikaika Woolsey, the team’s starter last week. Neither has been great this season. Wittek is completing just 44.9 percent of his passes and has eight interceptions to five touchdowns. Woolsey has completed 50 percent of his passes with three interceptions and one touchdown. \nWith Wittek in the game, Hawaii likes to run four-receiver sets. With Woolsey, it’s more run-oriented. If healthy, Wittek, who was a top recruit coming out of high school, is expected to start. \n“He’s awfully talented physically,” Polian said. “There are some throws you see early in the season and you go, ‘Oh, why did you throw that?’ There are other throws where you say, ‘Oh, boy, there aren’t very many quarterbacks who can stick that in there.’ He has physical gifts. There’s no doubt about it. \n“But I don’t want to downplay the value of (Woolsey). The offense moves pretty effectively when he’s in there.’ There’s obviously more run when he’s in there and there’s some quarterback run when he’s in there. We are prepared to see both and expect to see both.” \nWOLF PACK FOOTBALL \nWho: Hawaii (2-5, 0-3 MW) at Nevada (3-4, 1-2) \nWhen: Saturday, 1 p.m. \nWhere: Mackay Stadium (capacity, 30,000) \nTV/Radio: None/94.5 FM \nBetting line: Nevada favored by 7.5 \nWeather: High of 74; low of 41 22 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1LLJhtb TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:11:25.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
