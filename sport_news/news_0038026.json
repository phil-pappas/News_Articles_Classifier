Buy this photo Photo courtesy of Bonnie Zimmermann Senior first singles Jennie Miller scored victories in both of the Glen Rock girls tennis team's state-tournament wins, defeating opponents from Midland Park and Cresskill. \nHead coach Bonnie Zimmermann said, \"The Cresskill match could have gone either way, as we were closely matched. We had to change the lineup, and Celia Hans moved up to third singles instead of Mikaela Rosen. And one of the first doubles players, Kayla Gutnikova, was out sick as well.\" \nThe first and second singles players won their matches against Cresskill, Jennie Miller at No. 1 and Haley Rosenwald at No. 2. The coach said Miller was steady and in charge as usual and Rosenwald faced a player very similar to herself. She said both hit fast shots and moved very well.\" \nShe said Hans stepped up to play a tough third singles match. \"She had some great points and really moved well during the long rallies.\" \nThe coach said the revamped first doubles team of Janet Downing and Kaitlin Stansel sustained a tough loss to Cresskill's team. \"They were setting up nice points and had close games,\" she said. \nThe young second doubles team of sophomore Kate Gifford and freshman Emma Mangino went three sets but lost in their debut match. \"They were both focused and determined to win,\" Zimmermann said. \"While they were disappointed by their loss, I told them that their competitive play and determination showed that the future of Glen Rock girls tennis is bright.\" \nAll of the Glen Rock regulars are seniors and the coach said next year will be a fresh start. \nWith four league matches to play, Glen Rock had lost only to Rutherford and hoped to at least share the title. Hawthorne, Pompton Lakes, Lodi and Mary Help of Christians were the league opponents left on the schedule. The Panthers had a 9-1 record in the division. \nThe season started on a sour note with a 4-1 loss at Mahwah, but then the Panthers won eight in a row before losing to Leonia. They opened state-tournament play with a 5-0 victory over Midland Park. \nJim Jones' e-mail address is jonesji@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:27:02.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
