There was no tweeted apology from the owner at the end of the game this time. But there should have been.\nAdChoices Somehow, Jed York had the gall 11 months ago, on Thanksgiving night, to claim that the 49ers’ embarrassing 19-3 loss at home to the Seahawks “wasn’t acceptable.’’\nMORE: Best photos from Seahawks-49ers | NFL Week 7 picks\nIf that deserved an apology, what does the fan base get for a 20-3 beating , in the same building, to the same team, your long-time arch-rival, on another Thursday night, that was even uglier than last year?\nThe fans at Levi’s Stadium must have thought the same thing, as much as they booed as the teams left the field when it was over.\nOnce again, though, York gets the privilege of ownership. He can’t be fired. He should be, but he can’t be. This mess flows straight from the top. This is all on him.\nThe 49ers aren't unlucky. They didn’t guess wrong on this player or that. Their young quarterback “regressing” isn’t the problem. Jed York let the franchise crumble.\nAnd crumble it has. This has to be rock-bottom. It can’t get worse. If it is, then the NFL might need to find a hidden by-law, or vote one in, to shove York out.\nThe Seahawks weren’t even close to the team that had handled the 49ers last year. The two teams came in with the same 2-4 record. But once it started, they looked as if they weren’t even playing in the same league.\nHow? Everybody knows how.\nJim Harbaugh isn’t there, and 10 months later there’s still no acceptable excuse for letting him get away. If Harbaugh was really the problem, how could what America saw Thursday night possibly be the solution? Was whatever went down to create that rift so bad it couldn't be mended, and this was the alternative they chose to live with?\nColin Kaepernick has been ruined, almost Robert Griffin III-level ruined. The wild overthrows were good for laughs, when they weren’t bringing concerns for the safety of those on the sidelines (a trainer had to be attended to early in the game after catching one in the head ). The ferocious beating he took because of the total lack of protection up front wasn’t funny at all.\nThus, yet another franchise has failed to build around a young quarterback talent. Yes, the salary structure has changed a lot in recent years — but is it really that much more difficult to do these days than a decade or so ago?\nThe 49ers were making it work with Harbaugh mind-melding with Kaepernick. True, their last year together, last season, was no masterpiece. It was still better than the disaster the nation witnessed Thursday against the Seahawks, and on too many other days already, less than halfway through the season.\nNever mind for a second that the 49ers were in the Super Bowl three years ago. They were one Richard Sherman break-up away from the Super Bowl two years ago. If not for all the off-field infighting last year, who knows whether they could have sustained it another year?\nBut compared to this, those are the good ol’ days.\nYork made the wrong call on Harbaugh. He dumped the mess in the lap of a loyal assistant in Jim Tomsula, who did nothing to deserve this as his first head-coaching job. York oversaw personnel mistakes, such as trusting Aldon Smith, and a suspicious-looking mass defection of players who chose to retire prematurely, plus free agents who bolted quickly.\nJed York owes somebody some answers. NFL contenders aren't suppose to implode this quickly without some kind of catastrophic event — injury, major suspension. Or un-salvageable internal conflict. Like driving a winning head coach back to the college ranks.\nHow can York not be sorry about that again? Not only sorry, but even sorrier than last year?\nNo way the owner accepts that. Because the fans booing the 49ers off the field weren’t accepting it. The chances are excellent that the man at the top was the most unacceptable of all.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl-news/4658986-nfl-picks-week-7-undefeated-patriots-jets-predictions-panthers-eagles-", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl-news/4659003-nfl-week-7-seahawks-49ers-seavssf-marshawn-lynch-russell-wilson-colin-kaepernick-tnf", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658998-nfl-week-7-photos-pictures-seahawks-49ers-football-tyler-lockett-bruce-miller", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl-news/4658997-colin-kaepernick-bad-pass-hits-49ers-trainer-in-the-head-video-seahawks", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:26:48.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
