Apparently you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.\nAdChoices Zac Rinaldo was traded this offseason from the Flyers to the Bruins, a move that confused many in the northeast as people didn’t believe Rinaldo was worth the ink his check was printed on. He declared to the Boston media that he was a changed man and wouldn’t be up to his normal antics. It looks like three weeks into the season was enough time for him to revert back to his old form.\nRinaldo, who has been known as a pugilist first and foremost, didn’t look to make a play on the puck which may have very well been his downfall. He wasn’t trying to injure Sean Couturier on the play, but since he was defenseless, the play turned out to be very, very ugly.\nThe league decided no additional discipline was warranted.\nBoston's Zac Rinaldo will not face supplemental discipline for his hit on Philadelphia's Sean Couturier.

An intangible that I am sure will warrant more playing time moving forward.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://t.co/hrLAitmYkl", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/NHLPlayerSafety/status/657290461716070400"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:53:07.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
