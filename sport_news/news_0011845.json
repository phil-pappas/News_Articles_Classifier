Crown came close to a last gasp leveler, although Um Tola’s strike was ruled out at the death.\nSingapore Welcome Warriors\nSingapore, meanwhile, will attempt a repeat of July’s qualifier by handing Cambodia another beating in their Thursday clash at Singapore’s Sports Hub.\nSingapore made an emphatic start to their qualification campaign in June with a 4-0 win over Tae Hoon’s men in Phnom Penh’s Olympic Stadium.\nThe win was followed days later by an impressive 0-0 draw away to Japan, one of Asia’s strongest nations. Their most recent group game saw the side edged out 1-0 in a tight contest.\nCambodia currently sits at the bottom of the table in fifth place with 0 points. Afghanistan sits above the Kingdom in fourth, while Singapore is in third. Japan sits in second with seven points while Syria tops the group with nine points.\nCambodia, ranked 180th in FIFA’s world rankings, has had a cruel awakening after beating Macau to make it to the second stage of qualification.\nDespite the quality of attacking talent at Tae Hoon’s disposal, Cambodia are yet to hit the back of the net in this second round group stage and Tae Hoon will hope the team can have some of the class in front of goal they showed yesterday against Bernd Stange’s Singapore next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:36:37.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
