A week after they followed a first-quarter touchdown with another quick six points off a takeaway to lead early 14-0 before holding on for a 1-score win St. Joseph:Lafayette, the Hornets gave up the first-period TD, then made a turnover that quickly became another score for a 14-0 hole in the middle of the opening segment. Just as Lafayette did against them, they had the scoring edge the rest of the way, but, despite chances, never caught up and fell one score shy. \"Little mistakes early, we got behind, not making a couple of catches and plays when we had a chance to make them,\" Phil Willard, the CHS head coach, touched on some of the factors which dropped Chillicothe’s overall record to 5-2 and Midland Empire Conference mark to 3-2. The defeat ended a 3-games CHS wins streak. \"That's what happens in a tough ballgame. You've got to make those plays.\" Just as Lafayette did against it, Chillicothe lost Friday’s turnover battle, playing a key role in its demise. In both games, after the early giveaway let the home team double its lead within a minute of taking it, the guests handed the ball over inside their opponent’s 5 in the second half to squander a budding threat. Whereas Lafayette, on a first-and-goal play, botched a handoff the Hornets recovered in the third quarter last week, at Savannah, an ill-advised Chillicothe second-down pass on the run came up short of its well-covered target was intecepted at the SHS 4 in the fourth period. Although the Hornets’ defense held quickly after the giveaway for CHS got the ball back in good field position, the Savannah defense stopped it on downs after only four plays and then ran out the clock to move above .500. Overall, the Savages now are 4-3 with a 3-2 conference record. Savannah never trailed in the game after HaydenHolt’s 50-yards bolt up the middle just past the mid-point of the first period. After kicker/quarterback Blake McGinness recovered the Hornets’ fumble on the ensuing kickoff, a quick, long pass and Taylor Gilbert’s first of two touchdown runs made it 14-0,Savages, about a half-minute later. Page 2 of 2 - Chillicothe answered with a long scoring march capped by Kyle Ross’s short run and, at the start of the second half, again drove to score as quarterbackCade Snyder made a great play, scrambling 24 yards around left end on a fourth-and-8 play to make it 14-13. However, CHS didn’t catch up as its conversion kick hit the offensive left upright. \"We lost a little momentum there,\" Willard acknowledged. That showed when Savannah followed with a 9-plays scoring drive that featured two fourth-down conversions. The second was a 47-yards jaunt by Seth Ussary on a beautifully-executed wingback counter – a staple of the Chillicothe offense. He was hauled down at the CHS 1, but Gilbert plowed in on the next snap and, after a third Hornets offside infraction, he also carried in for the conversion that made it a 2-possession game at 23-14, rather than a 1-possession game. The Hornets responded with another scoring drive, but, in part because of an illegal procedure penalty that turned a second-and-6 from the SHS 14 into second-and-long, the score was only a 36-yards field goal that still, at least, made it a 1-possession game at 22-16 with a quarter to go. That turned out to be the game’s last scoring, however, when the Hornets’ long fourth-quarter drive was cut short by the interception while backup quarterbackBrett Young was subbing for a temporarily-injured Snyder. Unofficially, Savannah, whose run defense really stiffened over the last 1-1/2 quarters, out-gained Chillicothe 337-294. Combined with the 2-0 advantage in takeaways, that was enough to win. Chillicothe moves on to visit Smithville this coming Friday. After being in contention at halftime against likely MEC champion Maryville at home this past Friday, Smithville could not hang with the ’Hounds in the last 24 minutes, eventually losing surprisingly big, 43-7. \"It will be a tough game at Smithville, but we're looking forward to it. I know the kids are going to work hard. A great bunch of kids, a lot of character, and I guarantee you they'll give us everything they've got.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:41:02.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
