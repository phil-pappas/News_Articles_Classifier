At one stage I saw some of the guys lying down and I told the guys ‘look we have to go and fight now’ and the guys produced.” \nWales coach Warren Gatland was downcast. “At the start the boys gave everything. They just weren’t good enough to hang on in the last few minutes.” \nDu Preez’s score gave South Africa a four-point lead and that meant Wales, with goal-kicking fly-half Dan Biggar off the field for a head injury assessment, needed a try to regain the lead. \nBiggar had a fine match, kicking 14 points and setting up Gareth Davies for Wales’ only try. \nSouth Africa recalled JP Pietersen after the winger missed the 64-0 rout of the United States with a knee injury. \nWales brought back tough-tackling flanker Dan Lydiate following their 15-6 pool loss to Australia. Veteran prop Gethin Jenkins returned to the front row. \nGatland blasted Wales before the game for failing to take their chances and they missed an early opportunity on Saturday. \nGeorge North powered his way down the left wing only to be tackled short of the line. \nThe ball was worked across field but, with Morgan in space, Jenkins’ pass sailed over the centre’s head and into touch. \nSouth Africa took the lead through Pollard’s eighth-minute penalty as English referee Wayne Barnes penalised Wales for not rolling away at the breakdown. Pollard made it 6-0 minutes later. \nWales, with Roberts charging hard, won a penalty in front of the posts and Biggar made no mistake. \nPollard restored South Africa’s six-point advantage but Wales hit back with an 18th minute try. \nBiggar launched a high kick, beat South Africa full-back Willie le Roux to the ball and then released Davies for a try which Biggar converted to make it 10-9 to Wales. \nBut Pollard’s fourth penalty put the Springboks 12-10 ahead. \nBiggar, however, was on target with a drop-goal in the final play of the first half to edge Wales into a 13-12 lead at the break. \nEarly in the second half, 2011 semi-finalists Wales were penalised for pulling down a maul only for Pollard to miss his first goal-kick of the match. \nBurger conceded a 46th-minute penalty for obstruction and Biggar’s long-range effort from near the half-way line sailed over to make it 16-12 to Wales. \nPollard’s drop-goal cut a tiring Wales’ lead to 16-15 before he missed a 41-metre penalty. \nSouth Africa won another penalty heading into the final quarter and Pollard from out wide on the left, nudged the Springboks into an 18-16 lead. \nFrom the re-start, however, South Africa were off their feet at a ruck and Biggar edged Wales ahead at 19-18 until du Preez struck.
