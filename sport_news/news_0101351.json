(Stacy Revere / Getty Images) Associated Press \nSouth Carolina is moving its home game against Louisiana State to Baton Rouge, La. because of massive flooding around the university in Columbia. \nThe time for Saturday's game at LSU has not been announced. \nSouth Carolina officials wanted to keep the game in Columbia, but said Wednesday that law enforcement who would direct traffic and keep Williams-Brice Stadium safe were needed elsewhere in the area to help clean up from the massive flooding. \n\"The stress on law enforcement and first responders is too great. Moreover, we've had many in the Carolina family directly impacted by the flooding,\" South Carolina President Harris Pastides said in a statement. \nPastides said if he canceled classes this week because 34,000 students was too much for the city's damaged infrastructure to handle, he couldn't justify bringing in 84,000 people for a football game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:24:50.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
