The 140-pound Indians defensive back spent the entire first half positioned 10 yards off the line of scrimmage, and Wildcats’ quarterback Carter Dahmen and receiver Grant Kinzer made a living by completing quick passes into the flats. The Colton duo combined for 12 completions and 159 yards before the intermission, including a 35-yard touchdown play 10 seconds before the break that drew the Wildcats within 22-6. Touchet received the second-half kickoff and drove 63 yards in 12 plays, capped by James Kates’ 2-yard blast into the end zone. Andrew Flagstead’s 2-point pass to Caleb Shanks boosted Touchet’s lead to 30-6 and restored some momentum, but it remained to be seen if the Indians could slow down the Dahmen-to-Kinzer connection and Colton’s high-octane aerial arsenal. Orozco had the answer. On Colton’s very first play from scrimmage following the ensuing kickoff, Orozco crowded the line of scrimmage, stepped in front of Kinzer and snagged Dahmen’s 31st passing attempt of the game. He returned the pick 25 yards for a Touchet touchdown that put the Indians on top 36-6 and the game’s outcome was essentially decided with 5:49 remaining in the third quarter. “We told our kids at halftime that they were going to keep running that play until we showed them we could stop it,” Touchet coach Gary Dorman said. “And we did, although I don’t think we necessarily expected the pick-six. “Part of it was that we were willing to give up the inside stuff, bend but not break,” Dorman added in explaining his team’s first-half defensive game plan. “We had watched them on film scoring on 60-, 70- and 80-yard pass plays, and we wanted to make them work to get the ball down the field. “I thought our defense played lights out all day long. Because defending the pass in 8-man football is so difficult to do.” Dahmen, one of only two seniors on the Colton roster, put the ball in the air 59 times a la coach Mike Leach’s offense at Washington State University 14 miles up the road in Pullman. Dahmen completed 36 of them for 329 yards and both Wildcat touchdowns. “Maybe Leach should watch these guys play, he might pick up some pointers,” Dorman said with a chuckle. But the Colton quarterback was nearly as effective in the second half, completing 11-of-21 passes for 138 yards and misfiring on six of his final eight attempts. And Kinzer caught just four passes for 48 yards after the intermission, the last of them a 4-yard touchdown catch midway in the fourth quarter. Touchet’s pass rush — led by Leo Garcia, Titus Miller and Justin Warren — had a lot to do with that. Dahmen was tackled behind the line of scrimmage seven times for 29 negative yards, and the Wildcats finished the day with just two yards rushing on 15 attempts. Meanwhile, the Indians’ ground game was effective as usual, with Garcia leading the way as usual. The 140-pound senior mighty mite carried the ball 24 times for 217 yards and scored four touchdowns, the longest a 62-yard romp in the first quarter when he shook off a would-be Colton tackler at the 25-yard line and danced into the end zone from there. The Indians chewed up 303 rushing yards on 45 attempts, with freshman Isaac Gutierrez polishing off the assault with an 11-yard touchdown run at the 2:38 mark of the fourth quarter. And Flagstead, Touchet’s second-year quarterback, also got into the act. Flagstead completed three of his four passing attempts for 50 yards and found fellow senior Carlos Rincon for 27 yards and a TD in the third quarter. The victory enabled the Indians to remain undefeated as they improved to 4-0 in league games and 6-0 overall. In suffering its first SEB1-8 defeat, Colton slipped to 3-1 and 5-2. The Indians, No. 3 in Washington’s Class 1B-8 state rankings, entertain winless St. John-Endicott next Friday. The Eagles fell to 0-7 on the season with Friday’s 68-6 loss to Dayton. Meanwhile, Colton travels to Richland to take on No. 1-ranked Liberty Christian, which improved to 4-0 in league play and 7-0 overall with Friday’s 84-46 win over Garfield-Palouse.
