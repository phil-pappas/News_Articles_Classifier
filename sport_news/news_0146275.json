He coached track and field and girls’ basketball. New Bern High is where he grew as a coach and learned about the X’s and O’s that go into game planning. On Monday evening, the first-year head man at Eastern Wayne will take on his alma mater in an Eastern Carolina Conference football clash. The game was originally scheduled for Friday, but after several days of torrential rain, it was moved to this week. Because of sloppy field conditions, the game was postponed Monday and they will decide on when they will play on Monday morning. “Coach (Bobby) Curlings, (defensive coordinator) Coach (Steve) Lovett, (defensive backs) Coach (Joe) Davis, I continue to talk to them at least once or twice a week,” Gray said. “It’s going to be a little odd going against the Bears as a head coach here, but they taught me a lot and I learned a lot there. “I still have love for them anytime – except for when we play them.” Gray was with the New Bern program from when it wasn’t at its best, and was there through the rise. “While I was at New Bern, I learned that you have to go out and work and earn respect from the rest of the state,” Gray said. “When I went to high school there in the early 90s, the football program was not very successful. “Over the years, it turned into a powerhouse. I’m just trying to teach the kids and the community about tradition, having faith and taking pride in your school, your town, your community.” New Bern has won three state championships since 2007, and has played in the state finals six times since 2001. Eastern Wayne has been on the upswing as well, playing in the NCHSAA 3A Eastern Finals in each of the past two seasons. This year is a little different for both. New Bern, after last week’s 39-7 win over Southern Wayne, is 2-3 on the year. Eastern Wayne is also 2-3 after last Monday’s 30-14 loss to South Central. “Anytime you are playing the defending state champs or a team of New Bern’s caliber, you have to be ready to go at any time,” Gray said. “They have a very strong running game and they have a defense that can go out and play.” New Bern finally got its running game going last week as Ray’shi Bolds racked up 153 yards and two touchdowns and D.J. Howard gained 157 yards with a touchdown. Page 2 of 2 - “We are anticipating people crowding the box a little bit, so we have to improve our passing game,” New Bern head coach Bobby Curlings said. “To be able to run well, we have to pass better to keep the defense honest.” Despite winning their last two, the Bears have fumbled five times and committed 21 penalties during that span. If New Bern hopes to continue its roll, Curlings knows it must take care of the ball. “We have to quit turning the ball over. We can’t expect to win if we keep putting the ball on the ground and turning the ball over,” he said. Bolds is fourth in the coverage area with 321 rushing yards and five touchdowns. Howard has 289 rushing yards. Quarterback Dee Becton will lead the offense, and Tyric McCarter has 189 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions on defense. The Bears’ defense hasn’t been scored on since a Sept. 4 loss at West Craven. They’ve forced six turnovers in their last two games. Eastern Wayne quarterback Kamone Best is back from an injury, and offensively, he has seniors Blake Hartsfield, Robert Gonzalez and Devonte Corum to assist him. “They are fast, they are physical and their quarterback is one of the better players in the league, and is coming off an injury,” Curlings said. “We have are hands full. They have the capabilities of lining up four and five wide and throwing the ball down field, and he’s an outstanding runner.” New Bern Bears at Eastern Wayne Warriors When: TBA (will be deciding Monday morning) Where: Warrior Stadium, Goldsboro Coaches: New Bern: Bobby Curlings (101-26-1, 10th season); Eastern Wayne: Philemon Gray (2-3, first season) Key players: New Bern: RB Ray’shi Bolds, RB D.J.
