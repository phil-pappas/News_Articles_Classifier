Not too many people could have seen that one coming. \nThe Utes (4-0) drew a bit of attention by beating Michigan in Jim Harbaugh’s debut as coach, but a lopsided victory over Oregon in Eugene two weeks ago burst them onto the national scene. Utah moved up to No. 5 for the third time as a program and the earliest it has in a season. The Utes also received seven first-place votes in this week’s poll and have now become a trendy pick to reach the College Football Playoff. \nCalifornia (5-0) has quickly turned things around under coach Sonny Dykes, in position to match their win total of the past two seasons combined if they can beat Utah. Bears quarterback Jared Goff has put himself at the top of this year’s quarterback crop with a strong start. \nThe Big Ten marquee game features No. 13 Northwestern against Harbaugh’s No. 18 Wolverines. Michigan was picked to finish fourth in the East in the preseason poll and Northwestern fifth in the West, so this is another few-saw-this-coming game. \nThe Wildcats (5-0) have a stingy defense that’s allowed a nation-low 7.0 points per game after pitching consecutive shutouts. Michigan (4-1) has been pretty good on that side of the ball, too, holding opponents scoreless in 14 of the past 15 quarters and is second nationally in total defense, allowing 184 yards per game. \nWe’re going out on a limb and saying there probably won’t be a lot of scoring in the Big House. \n___ \nSEMINOLES AND HURRICANES \nFlorida State has controlled its in-state rivalry over Miami with five straight wins, longest in the series since the Seminoles won seven straight from 1963-72.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:52:50.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
