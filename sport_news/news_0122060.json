Playoff opponents and classes will be announced by the IHSA Saturday night. As for the area teams, Canton and Lewistown have already been eliminated. South Fulton and North Fulton are on the bubble while Farmington is an odds-on bet to be among the 256 teams which will have a 10th game. Friday Night Lights Dunlap (4-2, 5-3) at Canton (3-5, 1-5) The Little Giants enter the game off of a 53-40 win at Morton while the Eagles lost 19-15 to Limestone last Friday. \"For our seniors, this will their last game at home,\" said coach Ryan Pearson. \"For most of them, it will be the last football game that they will play.\" \"Dunlap is coming in off a tough loss to Limestone,\" added Pearson. \"They will be hungry.\" It appears that the Eagles will be in the playoffs as they have 40 playoff points as of now. Last year it took 39 to make the postseason. However, a 6-3 record compared to 5-4 should give a team an easier opponent in the first round. \"That they are very athletic is what stands out to me,\" noted Pearson. \"Their quarterback is an athletic kid and their running back is very shifty. And Mangieri (Charlie) has a verbal offer from Indiana.\" Mangieri figures to line up at either tight end or in the slot. \"We got to account for him wherever he's at,\" said Pearson. \"We have to try to limit their big plays,\" Pearson said. \"Defensively, they seem to get a lot of hats on the ball and we have to contain their front seven.\" In winning last week, the Little Giants broke their five-game losing streak against the Potters. Steven Bitner had a great night running the ball with over 200 yards. Quarterback Bradley Henseler helped out immensely with over 150 yards in the air. Farmington (5-3, 4-1) at Rushville-Industry (6-2, 4-1) The Farmers appear to have set their course for a 10th game after their victory over Peoria Heights last Friday. Coach Toby Vallas' club currently has 36 playoff points and will tack on three and maybe as many as five from Friday's action. However, a sixth win guarantees a playoff game and in theory an easier opponent than a team which finishes 5-4. Quarterback Steven Gilstrap was effective both on the ground in and in the air last week while Cade Lansford found running room in the second half while filling in for Jake Jepson. The Rockets, who received an automatic big by winning the Prairieland Conference's Black Divison are looking for their seventh win, which might even get then a home game in the first round. As had been their case all year, it's run, run, run with the ball. Page 2 of 2 - Elmwood (7-1, 5-0) at South Fulton (4-4, 2-3) As in small-school football, injuries turned South Fulton's season into a disaster after a promising start. Coach Dave Wilson's team won four of their first six, but have lost two in a row since then as the injuries mounted. And with the Trojans coming to town, a win on Friday night doesn't look promising. The Trojans are led on the ground by Sam Marincic (730) and Jackson Harkness (579). Todd Hollis' team doesn't throw the ball much, but quarterback Austin Sims had completed 31 of his 58 attempts for 516 yards. North Fulton (4-4, 2-3) at Havana (1-7, 0-5) The Wildcats have an opportunity to finish over .500 with a victory over the Ducks, whose only win was by forfeit over River Valley. Unfortunately, coach Elliott's Craig's team will be far down on the list of those playoff-eligible teams as they have just 22 playoffs points through their first eight games. Through the first eight weeks four of North Fulton's opponents (West Central, Ridgewood, River Valley, and Havana) have a combined 2-30 record. Things have not gone well for John McCormick in his first year at Havana. The Ducks have struggled on offense (69) and have given up 330 points on defense. Lewistown (3-5, 2-3) vs West Prairie/B-PC) 2-6, 2-3 at Sciota These two teams come into their final game heading in the opposite direction. The Indians have won three in a row with wins over Rushville-Industy, Ab-ingdon-Avon, and Havana. The fourth consecutive win will certainly give Darren Winkler's team some momentum heading into the off-season. As for the Sparclones, coach Dave Roddis' team has lost four games in a row â€” Elmwood, Farmington, Knoxville, and Rushville-Industry. With no playoffs on the horizon, a will by either team will brightened up an otherwise disappointing season.
