Leadership is a transfer of emotion, and in that case I would say [Klopp] will be good. \n\"Jurgen is a very emotional man whether he wins or loses, and I think his style of management will fit in well with this squad. It will also match, I would say, the values and probably the enthusiasm of the fans there.\" \nKlopp will take charge at Anfield for the first time on Thursday for the Europa League group stage clash with Rubin Kazan.
