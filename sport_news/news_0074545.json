The No. 18 Miami hockey team’s freshman class scored all three of its goals to seal away a weekend sweep of in-state rival Ohio State, 3-1, on Saturday night. That victory extends the RedHawks’ unbeaten streak to three games (2-0-1) and moves them to 2-1-1 overall this year. Miami put together the best early opportunity when Sean Kuraly threaded a pass to Kiefer Sherwood, who one-timed a shot from the low slot that Matt Tompkins shrugged off in the opening minutes. A couple shifts later, a deft bank pass by Andrew Schmit created a 2-on-1 rush for Ryan Siroky, whose wrister from the left circle was turned aside by Tompkins. The RedHawk penalty kill had to go to work at the 6:09 mark as they were called for tripping. The first half of the power play featured more chances for Miami than Ohio State as Josh Melnick and Louie Belpedio both had transition chances that Tompkins turned away in what was a successful kill. A Miami power play bore fruit as Melnick finished an outstanding passing sequence as Anthony Louis dropped the puck to Jack Roslovic at the right circle, where he whipped a cross-ice pass to the low left circle where Melnick one-timed it into the back door for his second goal of the season to make it 1-0 with 7:49 to go in the frame. The RedHawks got another power play at the 13:43 mark, but Tomkins made a couple stops to keep it a one shot game. MU took its one-goal lead into the locker room after 20 minutes and held a 13-9 advantage in shots. Alex Gacek nearly made it a 2-0 game in the opening minute of the second period. A blue line keep by Belpedio was chipped to Louis, who redirected it in the middle for a 2-on-1 rush. Louis fed Gacek at the right wing, where he fired a shot past Tompkins’ glove, but it went off the post and stayed out. The Buckeyes tied the score at 1-1 at the 5:22 mark when Mason Jobst wristed a shot through traffic that got by Ryan McKay. Miami then followed with a surge in the offensive zone as Louis and Taylor Richart both had in close chances that were kept out by Tompkins. Moments later, Roslovic fed Alex Gacek atop the crease with a cross-ice pass for a close range shot that Tompkins again slid to keep out. MU’s territorial domination led to a power play with 12:02 to go in the middle frame. That two-minute man advantage saw numerous grade-A opportunities for the Red and White as Kuraly had a chance in tight that Tomkins scrambled to get his body in front of and keep the score even. A sensational individual effort by Roslovic put Miami on top 2-1 with 6:04 to go. Melnick’s dogged effort forced a turnover at the Ohio State blue line. Roslovic took over and split the defense before working in tight and roofing a wrist shot to Tompkins’ glove side. Ohio State eventually got a power play with 1:59 left in the frame, but MU again had the better chances as Melnick slid a feed to Kuraly, whose tip caught Tompkin’s pad from in close. Taylor Richart also took part in a 2-on-1 rush late in the frame, then drew a five-minute major penalty on Ohio State with seconds remaining as MU held a 2-1 lead after 40 minutes. With an extended power play and a fresh sheet of ice to start the third period, Miami’s youngsters came through again at the 2:05 mark. Zach LaValle cashed in a rebound of Kiefer Sherwood’s shot for his first career point. Matthew Caito also picked up an assist as the Red and White grabbed their first two-goal lead of the season. Pace slowed down for the remainder of the period as the RedHawks held the Buckeyes to just seven shots on goal. A Miami penalty with 4:27 remaining gave Ohio State a last ditch opportunity, but Mu put an end to that with another solid kill. The Red and White then salted away the final moments to pull out the weekend sweep. The RedHawks scored twice in their five power plays, which ended an 0-for-11 drought coming into the night. Miami also killed all four Ohio State man advantages while outshooting OSU 41-28. Melnick and Roslovic both had multi-point nights with a goal and an assist apiece while McKay turned away 27 of 28 shots. Tompkins stopped 38 of 41 shots at the other end. Miami heads out to St. Lawrence for its final weekend series before the start of National Collegiate Hockey Conference play. The series begins on Friday at 7 p.m. Image and information courtesy Miami Univ Athletics Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:12:53.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
