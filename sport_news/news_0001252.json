As players change teams, new coaches are brought in, and new systems are implemented, it’s difficult to forecast how these things will play out.\nThat said, there are certain patterns in the data from past seasons that hold true and can give some insight into what lies ahead.\nFor individual players, shot attempts tend to be relatively stable from year to year. Consider all forwards who played at least 500 minutes in the NHL during each of the past two seasons (data from war-on-ice.com). Along the horizontal axis is a player’s shots per 60 minutes of play during the 2013-14 season, and on the vertical axis is the same player’s shots per 60 in 2014-15.\nWhile there is some variance, the points are clustered around the trend line and the slope of the line is relatively close to one, which shows that there is a very strong correlation from year to year, and, other than a few outliers, the correlation holds for just about all players.\nA player’s shooting percentage, however, shows way more year-to-year variation. In the next graph, a player’s shooting percentage in 2013-14 is presented on the horizontal axis, and that same player’s shooting percentage in 2014-15 is on the vertical axis.\nNot only are the points scattered more liberally around the trendline, the trend is considerably flatter, meaning that there is a tendency for regression–that is, other than a handful of true “snipers” at the top right of the graph, or fourth-liners with cement hands at the bottom left, players with high shooting percentages one season have a tendency to post a lower one in the next, while players with a low shooting percentage one season will have a tendency to increase their shooting percentage in the next.\nWith these pretty reliable principles in mind, here are some predictions for the upcoming season, two of which have some interesting twists.\nSome things never change: Alex Ovechkin\nNHL SI.com's 2015-16 NHL season crystal ball predictions by SI Staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:24:19.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
