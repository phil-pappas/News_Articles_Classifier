Peter Berkanish is the player. \nTogether, the father and son – along with a deep and strong cast of returnees – have combined to make Bergen Catholic one of the top boys soccer teams in North Jersey this season. \nIn his first year after replacing Rui Dos Santos, Pete Berkanish has led Bergen Catholic (10-1-2) to first place in the Big North United Division, a power points ranking among the top teams in its state tournament bracket and the No. 5 slot in The Record Top 25. \nPeter Berkanish has contributed both offensively and defensively to the Crusaders’ success as a senior two-way midfielder, compiling six goals and four assists and doing fine marking work all over the field. For his career, the 6-foot-1, 165-pound Berkanish has 17 goals and 11 assists. \n“Our depth has been a key positive factor for us, and I think the coaching transition has been very smooth and seamless,” said the younger Berkanish, who had a goal and an assist in a big 3-0 win Sept. 24 over Clifton, one of the top teams in Passaic County and No. 13 in The Record rankings. \nThe family’s Crusader roots run deep. \nA 1976 Bergen Catholic graduate, Pete Berkanish helmed the BC freshman team the previous five years, earning county freshman titles in 2011 and 2012. \nBesides succeeding at the scholastic level, he has served as a distinguished coach at the club level for the past 21 years. As the head man for the Arsenal, Blackhawk and World Class clubs, Berkanish has won four regional championships and three state cups from the 8 through 18 age levels. \nPete Berkanish’s most recent state cup crown came last season with a U-12 World Class team, which beat Albertson Soccer Club of Long Island, 3-2, in the final. \n“Our philosophy has always been that discipline and hard work leads to success,” Coach Berkanish said. “I believe you can learn a lot from the tapes. First you watch the game by yourself. Then you see it again with you and your teammates all together. And the third time around you dissect it to find ways to get better going forward. \n“It’s a simple, yet very effective process.” \nTop-seeded Bergen Catholic’s 3-2 double-overtime loss Sunday to eighth-seeded Pascack Valley in the Bergen County tournament quarterfinals was a particularly tough tape to digest. The Crusaders controlled play in the Indians’ zone for 60 to 70 percent of the contest and piled up a 21-6 edge in shots on goal. \nBut the resilient Bergen Catholic team moved on from that loss with a 3-1 victory Tuesday against DePaul in a United Division clash, helped by a goal from Peter Berkanish. Through Tuesday, the Crusaders were second in North Non-Public A in power points with 318.25, behind only 16-1 Delbarton (342.5). \nAmong the programs Peter Berkanish is considering are New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) schools Connecticut College, Tufts and Hamilton. \n“We just want to strive to get better and keep improving game by game,” Peter Berkanish said. “We’ve got a lot of camaraderie and chemistry on this team and we’re hoping for a dynamic rest of the season.” \nEmail: mills@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:03:48.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
