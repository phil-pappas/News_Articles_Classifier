Not today. This was about as lopsided a loss as the Saints have had in awhile. If you're looking for a silver lining you won't find one here. The Saints were thoroughly outplayed throughout the game. The Eagles gained a season-high 519 yards, forced four turnovers and punted just once in 13 offensive possessions. If not for end-zone interceptions early from Brandon Browner and Delvin Breaux it could have been even worse. ...\nThe Eagles entered the game as the NFL's worst team in time of possession but completely dominated the ball against the Saints. They converted a season-high 34 first downs and owned a decisive 34:02-25:58 advantage in time of possession. ...\nSean Payton, 'We struggled to stay on the field offensivelyâ€™ The Eagles beat the Saints 39-17 in Philadelphia, Sunday Oct. 11, 2015.\nThe Saints' patchwork offensive line, which played without left tackle Terron Armstead and right guard Jahri Evans, struggled to protect Drew Brees all game. Brees was sacked a season-high five times. Two of the sacks resulted in lost fumbles. Brees also was intercepted when he was hit on another pressure. ...\nFletcher Cox had a career game with six tackles, three sacks, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. Most of his damage came against Saints rookie Andrus Peat, who was replacing Armstead. ...\nIt's starting to sound like a broken record, but Brandon Browner struggled again. The veteran cornerback made the first interception of his Saints career but otherwise was exploited in coverage by the Eagles. He also was whistled for two penalties, which gives him an NFL-high nine in five games. This, after leading all cornerbacks with 16 infractions last season. Moreover, he continued to miss tackles while trying to strip the ball carrier of the football.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:20:01.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
