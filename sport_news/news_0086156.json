These days, pumpkin spice is a modifier on a list of foods that grows longer each fall: There are pumpkin spice lattes and breakfast cereals, doughnuts and yogurt-coated pretzels, pancakes and candy, even pizza and beer.\nBy Josh Rayburn There is much in this world that divides us: religion, politics, money, Taylor Swift.\nBut a new split among the American people has been created, and some of the instigators live right here in our very own Savannah. They might even be your neighbor. You might be sitting next to one right now and not even know it!\nI’m talking about pumpkin spice. There are those of us who like it (whether it be a lot or a little) and those who would rather drink a latte spiked with cat urine.\nThese people really hate pumpkin spice flavoring. I mean, really hate it.\nThese haters call themselves F.R.A.P.P.E.: Facebook Residents Against Pumpkin and Pumpkinspice-flavored Everything.\nAs this is a serious issue impacting our nation (and somehow not a question that has arisen at local or national political debates), we reached out to the group’s members. Two of them — Robert “I’m in this group but eat my wife’s pumpkin spice pretzels” Richardson and Jeff “I’m friends with the pretzel eater” Doke — responded.\nHere’s what they had to say:\nWhy did you form the group?\nWe were founded on Sept. 5, 2014, to fill a void. Planking and Tebowing had burned themselves out and the whole Whip/Nae-Nae madness hadn’t started yet, so we needed a new hobby to keep ourselves out of trouble. Since we’re now being interviewed by the regional leader in print and online media, we’ve obviously failed miserably at that last point.\nWhat did pumpkin spice ever do to you?\nPumpkin spice finds its roots in the vastly inferior Thanksgiving dessert known as the pumpkin pie. While we can appreciate the American ingenuity and work ethic that makes sure that none of the by-products left over from the Halloween jack-o’-lantern are wasted, we feel that the space on the dessert table would be better served with another pecan pie or a red velvet cake. Real red velvet, though, with chopped pecans mixed into the frosting. Anything less is an affront to our collective American values.\nDo you feel like pumpkin spice has ruined the pumpkin?\nPumpkins are already suffering from poor self-image issues. They are part of the squash family, but are treated like the gourd which has an eating disorder or massive clinical halitosis. The Pumpkin Spice craze has only continued to keep this trend moving along, without any regard whatsoever to the humble pumpkin’s self-esteem. Sad, really.\nHow do you spread your message of hate?\nWe spread our gospel through random acts of kindness, hugs for all, and the ever rising bile of sarcasm.\nAmerica loves pumpkin spice. You and your members hate pumpkin spice. Do you and your members hate America, too?\nYes, America loves pumpkin spice. However, America also loves Justin Bieber, diet caffeine-free soda, Kanye West, the infield fly rule, and The Real Housewives of Rincon. Obviously, America doesn’t know what is good for it.\nRegardless, we do not hate America. We love America. The massive amounts of rare to medium-rare sirloins, small-batch craft bourbon, and deep-fried pastries we consume are the only bona fides that we need to provide to dispute that blatantly false accusation.\nWhat’s the most disgusting pumpkin spice flavored thing you’ve seen? Eaten?\nThat’s a tough call, but we’re going to go with pumpkin spice Twinkies, simply because the packaging makes it look like someone had filled a Twinkie with deviled ham.\nHow can people join your cause?\nJust search for our group — F.R.A.P.P.E. — on Facebook. Don’t forget the periods after each of the initials. It’s a closed group, but obviously our standards aren’t that high.\nYou don’t even necessarily need to hate pumpkin spiced paraphernalia. At least one of our members (who is a local drive-time DJ and Georgia Radio Hall of Fame nominee) is a PS enthusiast and she uses the group to scout out new ways to feed her addiction.\nName at least one pumpkin spice-flavored item you like.\nPumpkin spice dog food. Come February, it will be on clearance at the dollar store, and my dog doesn’t have nearly the discriminating palate that I do.\nIf you’re successful in eradicating pumpkin spice, are you worried something else will just take its place?\nAs a very wise man once scrawled in the locker room of the sadly departed Savannah Sand Gnats, “for every whip, there is an equal and opposite nae-nae.” We’re quite certain something else will take its place, but y’know what? We’re OK with that. We’ve survived Snuggies, twerking, Honey Boo-Boo and skinny jeans. We’re ready for whatever comes next. Now, excuse me whilst I tell these darn kids to stay the heck offa my lawn and to get rid of those stupid man buns.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14814982.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14814982.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:12:09.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
