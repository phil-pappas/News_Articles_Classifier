(AP Photo/ Butch Dill, File) × COLUMBIA — Coming off its first winning season in six years, the South Carolina men’s basketball team has been picked to finish in the top half of the SEC in a preseason media poll. USC was picked to finish seventh in the league Wednesday at the SEC’s Tipoff 2015 media event in Charlotte. The Gamecocks received 204 points in the poll, 54 fewer than sixth-place Florida, and one more than eighth-place Mississippi State. Kentucky was the overwhelming favorite to win the league. The Gamecocks finished 17-16 last season, the first winning mark of head coach Frank Martin’s tenure. USC finished 11th in the SEC after being picked to place 12th in the preseason media poll. South Carolina has not had a winning season in SEC play since the 2008-09 campaign, also their last overall winning season until last year. Kentucky was followed in the balloting by Vanderbilt, Texas A&M, LSU, Georgia, Florida, USC, Mississippi State, Ole Miss, Auburn, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama and Missouri. Ben Simmons of LSU was elected preseason Player of the Year, while two Kentucky players — sophomore Tyler Ulis and freshman Skal Labissiere — were named first-team preseason All-SEC. South Carolina returns four starters from last season’s team, and adds a class of newcomers which includes freshman P.J. Dozier, USC’s first McDonald’s All-American in over a decade. The Gamecocks open the season Nov. 14 at Colonial Life Arena against Norfolk State.
