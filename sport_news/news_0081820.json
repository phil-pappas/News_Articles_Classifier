The ranking is the highest in school history and it's just the third time the Tigers have been nationally ranked at all.\nMemphis (6-0, 2-0 American Athletic Conference) has won 13 straight games dating back to last season, which is the third longest streak in the country. But there was plenty of skepticism about that achievement because of the Tigers' so-so schedule.\nThat changed in a big way on Saturday.\nJunior quarterback Paxton Lynch led a Memphis offense that was dominant for nearly the entire day. Ole Miss jumped to a 14-0 lead, but Lynch helped the Tigers respond with 31 straight points in a stunning rally. He completed 39 of 53 passes for 384 yards, three touchdowns and an interception.\nIt came in front of a crowd that topped 60,000 for the first time in nearly a decade. Players marveled at the atmosphere.\n\"When I first came here, there were not that many people in the stands and I come out there (Saturday) and there's not an empty seat out there,\" Lynch said.\nIt's the latest chapter in a remarkable turnaround for the Tigers under fourth-year coach Justin Fuente. Before the former TCU offensive coordinator arrived, Memphis was one of the worst teams in the country, with a 5-31 record over the previous three seasons.\nSuddenly the Tigers can't be stopped.\nFuente, Lynch and the Tigers had gone mostly unnoticed on the national stage before Saturday's win. Now they're in the midst of an upstart AAC that has three teams — Memphis, Houston and Temple — in the top 25.\n\"I just told them: 'You think there've been distractions before? Wait until now.'\" Fuente said. \"I'm going to try and protect them as best I can, to protect the group. But I know those things are going to come and we've got to do a great job of handling it.\"\nThe most immediate task for Memphis? Navigating a quick turnaround before a road game against Tulsa (3-3, 0-2 AAC) on Friday night.\nA huge reason for the Tigers' dominance is Lynch. The 6-foot-7, 245-pounder has thrown for 1,919 yards, 13 touchdowns and just one interception this season. He's completing nearly 71 percent of passes.\nLynch said he's confident Fuente's leadership will help squash any urge to lose focus.\n\"We were playing hard whenever there were no distractions, so whenever the distractions are here, we have to put our head down and keep working,\" Lynch said.\nSaid Fuente: \"We talk about getting better and continuing to improve. That's not just a one-week thing. We'll have another challenge next week to continue to get better.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:13:40.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
