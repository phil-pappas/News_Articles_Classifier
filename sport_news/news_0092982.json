The Cougars (5-4, 3-1 Region 3-5A) secured their school-record third straight playoff bid with a 42-13 victory over Karns, ending a two-game losing streak in the process.\nWhen coach Justin Price took over five years ago, Campbell County was coming off a 1-9 season. But Price has led a turnaround.\n\"It's great for our community and program,\" Price said. \"You're judged by your ability to get into the playoffs, and our guys have overcome adversity to get here.\n\"This program has been through a lot, and we're going to enjoy this.\"\nFor Campbell County, the win came on senior night, and the Cougars' ten seniors will leave as the winningest class in school history. But a junior stole the show early on.\nQuarterback Josh Lay was a one-man show in the first half, rushing for more than 200 yards and three scores and throwing for a touchdown.\nBut Lay went down with a shoulder injury halfway through the third quarter and never returned. Sophomore Zach Rutherford replaced Lay and led Campbell County on two more scoring drives, both ending with Jacob Bunch runs.\nKarns (2-5, 0-4) was able to hang with Campbell County early thanks to running back Devin Harper.\nThe Oklahoma State commit scored both of Karns' touchdowns in the first half. But Campbell County adjusted in the second half.\n\"You have to get used to Harper,\" Price said. \"I think his speed and power shocked us early on. We never did stop him, but we were able to contain him in the second half.\"\nKarns coach Tobi Kilgore was disappointed with the outcome of the second half.\n\"The scoreboard looked okay at the half, but penalties early in drives were killing us,\" Kilgore said. \"Then they just beat us in all three phases of the game.\n\"It's unfortunate because we had a chance to get in the playoffs tonight and we just didn't show up. We have two weeks left in the season to decide how we want to be.\"\nNathanael Rutherford is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:17:35.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
