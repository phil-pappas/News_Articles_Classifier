(AP Photo/Butch Dill) \nTALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) — Matt Kenseth hasn’t softened his stance on last weekend’s incident with Joey Logano. He said Logano is “lying” that he didn’t wreck Kenseth on purpose. \nKenseth was leading at Kansas Speedway, where a win would have earned him an automatic berth into the third round of NASCAR’s playoffs. He blocked to prevent Logano from passing him for the lead, but Logano made contact with him that caused Kenseth to spin. \nKenseth wound up 14th and heads into Sunday’s elimination race at Talladega Superspeedway last in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field. \nLogano won his second consecutive race and denied intentionally hitting Kenseth. \nKenseth bristled Friday at Logano’s claim and said Logano should stop talking about the incident. He also said the two have not spoken since Kansas. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:15:05.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
