That was the coaches. The coaches had a great play call. I just made the play. It could have been anybody in there.” \nWatson’s run came on second down on La Salle’s overtime possession. The quarterback bounced of a couple tacklers on a keeper and sprinted to the left corner of the end zone to end the game.
