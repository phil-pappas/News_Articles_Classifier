I was close to breaking one on the first kickoff, but this time I was able to outrun the coverage,” Graziani said. “It’s the first time that our seniors have defeated Austintown Fitch, so it’s a very special feeling right now.” \nIn losing their last three losses to the Falcons (6-3, 1-2), the Spartans (5-4, 2-0) have been outscored 110-12 with their last win coming during the 2011 campaign, a 14-0 shutout at their old Center Middle School location. \n“Austintown Fitch is a great program and that’s what makes this win so very special. We’ve had some battles over the years and tonight our defense played absolutely great,” Spartans head coach Joe Ignazio said. “Mario is a special kid and our kick-return squad has been special all year as well. We got some bodies to pop, which freed Mario on his return.” \nThe Spartans’ defense held the Falcons to just 118 total yards — 59 each rushing and via the passing route. \n“Our defensive staff is something else. When I took this job the first person I asked to be my assistant and defensive coordinator was Mike Popio,” Ignazio said. “He gets our team ready week in and week out and just brings a toughness that’s been instrumental in our success this year. The first goal is to win your conference and we always preach to our players that you want to play meaningful games in October. We’re now playing meaningful games in October.” \nAfter a scoreless opening quarter, the Spartans broke the stalemate when Adam Deeley nailed a 20-yard field goal with 23 seconds remaining for a 3-0 halftime advantage. \nThe Spartans’ defense held the Falcons to just 52 total yards in the first 24 minutes while Graziani racked up 58 of his game-high 79 yards in the opening session. \n“The game came down to how well our coaching staff had us prepared for this game. They told us all week what was going to happen, what we should expect and their tendencies,” Boardman defensive lineman Wes Thompson said. “They were absolutely right on all fronts.” \nFalcons placekicker Dylan Correia kicked a 35-yard field goal to tie the game at 3 with 5:26 to play,. \nThe ensuing kick-off proved to be their undoing when Graziani raced 95 yards for to be the game-winning score. \n“We knew going into the game that it would be a low-scoring affair as we both struggle offensively in putting points on the board,” Fitch coach Phil Annarella said. “When Dylan hit that field goal to tie the game we had the momentum, then gave it right back on the kickoff. I was proud of the fact that our kids fought the entire night and never gave up. Credit Boardman because they played an exceptional game tonight. We just didn’t play well enough to win.” \nFitch drove to the Boardman 19 in the closing seconds, but Spartans defensive back Alex Duda picked off Nate Fowler’s pass in the end zone to secure the victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:28:45.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
