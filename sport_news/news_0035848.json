That Samardzija was a star wide receiver for Notre Dame adds to the interest for the Yankees, who see better results ahead for Samardzija. They also may see a possible bargain following a year in which he had a near-5 ERA, totally uncharacteristic for him. The Yankees will almost definitely have to surrender a top pick if they sign the former Notre Dame tight end, since it's nearly a lock that Chicago will give him the qualifying offer. \nThe Yankees no longer appear sure they have an ace in righty Masahiro Tanaka, and health and injury concerns still surround pitchers they expect to return, such as Ivan Nova, Michael Pineda and CC Sabathia. \nBrendan Kuty may be reached at bkuty@njadvancemedia.com .
