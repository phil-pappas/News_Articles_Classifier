Hundreds sign petition to support ineligible Masuk runner 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nMONROE — A high school runner’s decision to participate in a town charity race has left him unable to compete for the remainder of the cross country season. \nColin Raymond, a sophomore on Masuk’s boys cross country team, was stripped of his eligibility for the Panthers’ final two regular-season meets and the postseason after running in last Sunday’s Monroe Trail Run 5K Run/Walk, benefitting Project Warmth. \nHis participation was against Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference rules, which prohibit athletes from running in non-sanctioned races during the season. CIAC officials declined comment on the situation Thursday. \nRaymond, 14, has received an outpouring of support through social media from family, friends, teammates and the public. \nAn online petition titled “ Free Colin Raymond ! Let him race!” created by Raymond’s teammate, sophomore Ethan Bassett , had generated 569 signatures as of 7 p.m. Thursday. Bassett first posted the page Tuesday night, hoping to at least raise awareness of the situation. \n“When we started it (Tuesday night), we weren’t even sure we were going to get 100 signatures,” Bassett said. “The whole town is helping us out. It’s been great. ... I honestly never thought we were going to get this far.” \nOn Monday, Masuk athletic director John DeGennaro and boys cross country coach Sean McDonald learned of Raymond’s participation from an opposing coach and did what they felt was correct. \n“We became aware of the situation and a possible violation, in this case, and you have to abide by the rules,” DeGennaro said Thursday by phone. “When the school becomes aware of the situation, I obviously know the rule, you call to check up if you’re correct. You have to take measures. As unfortunate as it may be, you have to abide by the rules.” \nThe rule caught everyone by surprise. Bassett’s first thought when he heard the news was that his good friend was pulling a prank on him, but Raymond was being serious. \n“I was pretty mad,” Raymond said, “and shocked. I wish I could get back on the team.” \nRaymond can still attend practices, but participation in any CIAC races before the fall season is over would result in a forfeit. \n“It wasn’t a competitive race,” Dave Raymond, Colin’s father, added Thursday. “To me it doesn’t really make sense, but that’s the rule. Personally, I think the rule’s crazy, but that’s the rule. \n“He went with me to volunteer in the morning. I’m one of the sponsors, and we had a couple open slots for the race. He decided at the last minute to run.” \nRaymond’s mother, Kathleen, said the family has been “completely overwhelmed” by the support. \n“I think it’s amazing what people are doing,” she said. “I’m shocked. I feel bad for (Colin). I think that it’s sad that he can’t run anymore. ... I hate to see him punished for doing a good thing.” \nThe family is unsure what the next step will be. They could appeal the decision with the CIAC, but they’ve been told it’s unlikely that a decision would be reached before the end of the season. \n“To me, if anything good comes from it, one would be that Colin can be reinstated,” Dave said. “Two, it’s that they can re-evaluate this rule. There are kids out there who want to run.” \nColin is one of them. \n“I thought the only reason I couldn’t run (in the charity race) is if the winner got money,” he said. “But no money was involved except for fundraising. \n“I really hope I get back on the team. I’m very thankful for all my friends and this town for being on my back and helping.” \ndbonjour@ctpost.com; @DougBonjour", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:21:07.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
