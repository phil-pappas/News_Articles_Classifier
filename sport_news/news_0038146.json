That was only 1:23 after No. 2 pick Jack Eichel’s first NHL goal brought Buffalo to within one.\nAssistant Jason Smith saw the offside and was one of the people who urged Cameron to challenge it with a replay.\n“Smitty thought it might be offside and, at that point, we were back on our heels and we had nothing to lose,” said Cameron, who added the club couldn’t communicate with video coach Tim Pattyson because the radio on the bench was broken.\nIt turned out to be a pivotal move.\n“It’s a great call. You could see clearly on the replay that it was offside,” said captain Erik Karlsson. “You couldn’t really see the play at the time because the game is fast out there but it’s a good way to get things right.”\nAwarded the alternate’s ‘A’ before Game 1, centre Kyle Turris scored twice to lead the way, Curtis Lazar put it in an empty net while Craig Anderson made 26 stops as the Senators opened this two-game road trip with a victory against a Buffalo team that is expected to improve this season. The Sabres came charging hard in the third by outshooting Ottawa 14-4 and Rasmo Ristolainen hit the post with three minutes in the game.\n“We played the first two road periods we wanted,” said Turris. “We played simple and we were aggressive in the offensive zone and not giving them much time to get going through the neutral zone.\n“I think we kind of came out a bit flatter in the third and let them take it to us a little bit. It was a good challenge by (Cameron).”\nThis game took a dramatic turn only 7:30 into the second when former Ottawa goalie Robin Lehner left with what appeared to be a right leg injury. He spoke with the club’s training staff, tried testing it out in the crease and then looked to be hurting pretty badly when he left the ice.\nThat meant Chad Johnson took over after Lehner made 11 stops on 12 shots. After the game, Sabres coach Dan Bylsma said Lehner won’t be back anytime soon.\nIt’s going to take awhile for the Senators to get into form. They certainly looked like a team that had just wrapped up camp and was still trying to find its way while the Sabres looked quite content to keep this one low scoring so they could maybe cash in on one of the few opportunities they were getting.\nThough the Senators had outshot the Sabres by a 18-13 count after 40 minutes, they were ahead 2-0. Johnson was put into a tough spot after being thrust into action but he wasn’t able to do much as the Senators pulled out to a two-goal lead in the second after some bad defensive play in the Buffalo zone.\nTurris scored his second of the night with 9:11 left in the second when he took a pass from Mike Hoffman and beat Johnson on the stick side. In 18 career games against the Sabres before this one, Turris had only two goals so it didn’t take him long to equal that output.\nReally, Lehner’s Buffalo career couldn’t have gotten off to a worse start. He talked about being nervous before the game and then he was beaten on the first shot when Turris was allowed to skate — untouched and wide open — into the slot and beat him high on the glove side. The Senators knew the game didn’t finish the way they wanted but they were happy to get away with the win.\n“They got the power-play goal (in the third) and it gave them life. It gave them the extra boost. For us, it was just trying to manage that,” said Anderson. “We were able to take some of the wind out of their sails with the coaches challenge. It allowed us to take a deep breath, settle down and finish the game off.”\nThe Senators face the Toronto Maple Leafs tomorrow night at the Air Canada Centre.\nIf you cannot view the Ottawa Senators vs. Buffalo Sabres live game blog , click the link.\nIn depth look at the Ottawa Senators\n2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.

Former 67 has just 20 PIMs in 130 career games and should be a Lady Byng candidate this season.\nTony Caldwell/Ottawa Sun\n6.

As such, he appeared to turn a corner in his career … Now 25 and entering fifth season as a pro, he’s hitting the crossroads in his career. Consistency will send him north … Sees first unit power play time when the team goes with two defencemen, second power play time when they go with one.\nTony Caldwell/Ottawa Sun\n61.
