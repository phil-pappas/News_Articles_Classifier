The offer of 42.15 pounds a share is 11 percent more than AB InBev's initial proposal and 28 percent higher than SABMiller's stock price before the bid was announced Sept. 16.\nAB InBev is trying to create what it calls \"the first truly global beer company\" by combining its business, which is focused on the Americas and Western Europe, with SABMiller's brands in Africa and Eastern Europe. The deal would create a company with 31 percent of the global beer market.\nTensions surrounding the proposal have risen in recent days, with SABMiller Chairman Jan du Plessis saying that AB InBev was \"very substantially undervaluing\" his company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:05:18.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
