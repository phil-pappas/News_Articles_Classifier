A life ban would kick them out of the world championships and Olympics, which is still the lifeblood of the sport and the best opportunities for professionals to make a living. \nVestager said \"athletes can only compete at the highest level for a limited numbers of years, so there must be good reasons for preventing them.\" \nThe Icederby offers prize money of 2 million dollars, and the ISU has said it fears it would become a target for betting. \n\"The ISU is confident that its rules comply with EU competition law and are necessary to protect skaters from the grave risks posed by corruption in sport,\" the federation said in a statement. \nMany top skaters have long protested that the ISU is not moving with the times and complain about a stranglehold which keeps them from reaching their full professional potential. Outside Olympic years, long-track speedskating finds it tough to find appeal outside its traditional hotbed of the Netherlands. \nTuitert welcomed the EU's decision to challenge the ISU. \n\"It's a breakthrough we have been waiting a long time for,\" he said, adding that while he has retired from the sport, \"the complaint is also for volunteers, coaches and everybody involved\" in speedskating. \nTuitert said it is \"a grave injustice that we are threatened with a lifetime ban.\" \nMike Corder contributed to this report from The Hague, the Netherlands. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:18:23.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
