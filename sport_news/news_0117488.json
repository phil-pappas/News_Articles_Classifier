Etna comes in a 2-5 overall and 1-1 in the SCL after falling to undefeated FallRiver 56-7 at home last Friday. Mount Shasta downed Burney at home 40-7 to improve to 1-6 overall and 1-1 in the SCL The varsity game begins at 7:30 p.m. at Mount Shasta High School. The junior varsity game gets underway at 5:30 p.m. Below,Etna High head varsity football coach Wade Dickinson discuses Friday’ contest. Wade, how is the squad's demeanor and focus this week after the loss to Fall River? The demeanor has been good this week. We know we have a lot to improve on and everyone is working hard. How crucial is Friday's game for the Lions? All of our games are crucial at this point. The SCL is tough this year as always. Mount Shasta is a solid team that is getting better each week. We know the importance of our remaining three games. I’d noticed that your squad was also 2-5 at this point last season. Your team won its last three regular season games and made it to the Northern Section D5 title game. And, you are playing the exact three teams this year in your three final NAL games (Mount Shasta,Weed, Burney) as you did last season. Also, you already have an SCL win compared to zero at this point last season. Does this give you and your players hope for another turnaround this season? We haven't spoke much of last year. Our goal is to improve in all aspects each week. Unfortunately we have been careless with the football at crucial times this season. Defensively we have given up big plays at bad times. We have to clean these things up in order to be successful. I believe if we can become consistent and be fundamental we will see better results on Friday nights. What can you tell me about Mount Shasta this season? Mount Shasta is an improving squad with a lot of talent and size. They have multiple threats that can hurt you at any given time. We will need to play well and take care of the football on Friday if we are to give ourselves a chance. What does your team have to do on both sides of the ball to earn a victory? Defensively we need to be physical and aggressive, take advantage of opportunities and be positive in the turnover category. Offensively we need to hold on to the football and play with confidence. Something we are working on exclusively this week. The boys are working hard and eager to get back on the field.
