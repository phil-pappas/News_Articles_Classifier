Here are the numbers:\nChicagoland, 1.91 rating/3.22 million average viewers; New Hampshire, 1.81/2.94 million; Dover, 1.91/3.2 million; Charlotte, 1.61/2.7 million.\nLast year, on ESPN, the first four Chase races ranged from 2.3 to 2.4.\nFor a comparison with another sport, the Chicago Cubs-Pittsburgh Pirates wild-card playoff game averaged 8.3 million viewers on TBS.\nMore coverage WATCH: Latest sports videos BUY: Philly sports gear DISCUSS: Join our sports forums The first three Chase races were on NBCSN. The Charlotte race was scheduled for NBC last Saturday night, where presumably it would have done a good number. Instead, the race was rained out and run Sunday afternoon back on NBCSN. Sunday's TV competition included NFL games and the Presidents Cup golf tournament on NBC.\nThe Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway, run on the Sunday night of Labor Day weekend, produced a 3.36 rating with 5.92 million viewers on NBC.\nThe good news for NBC and NASCAR is, four of the final six Chase races will air on NBC. No more night Chase races are scheduled.\nSo, is anyone at NBCSN reaching for the panic button? No way . . .\n\"When properties move (to different networks), it's a process with the fan base: It takes time,\" Tim Buckman, NBC Sports Group vice president for strategic communications, said Tuesday. NASCAR has returned to NBC for the first time since 2006.\nOne problem for NBCSN is, it isn't in as many households as ESPN: NBCSN is in 84 million households while ESPN is in 95 million. Also, NBCSN isn't carried in as many hotels as ESPN.\nDespite the lower Chase numbers, Buckman said NBCSN is pleased to have NASCAR on its cable network.\n\"The third quarter was the most watched on NBCSN,\" Buckman said, noting NASCAR races are the top five programs on the cable network. \"We knew NASCAR would be a great fit.\"\nBuckman said the daily \"NASCAR America\" show and \"NASCAR Victory Lap\" after races are gaining traction, as they say in the TV biz.\nTruex: Cubs on wheels Since many sports fans are climbing aboard on the Chicago Cubs playoff train, let's anoint Martin Truex Jr. and his Sprint Cup team as the Cubs of the Chase.\nTruex drives for a single-car team against the mighty Joe Gibbs Racing stable (four Chasers) and Penske Racing (two). Hendrick Motorsports (three) unexpectedly isn't so mighty in this year's Chase.\nEntering Sunday's second race of the Contenders Round at Kansas Speedway, Truex is third in Chase points. The Mayetta, N.J., driver led the most laps (95) in this year's May race at Kansas; he finished ninth.\nWith finishes of 13th, eighth, 11th and third in the Chase races, Truex is delivering what his crew chief Cole Pearn says is a key to Chase success.\n\"We want to be steady and make no mistakes,\" Pearn said before the Oct. 4 Dover race. \"You can't have a bad race.\"\nPearn, a Canadian in his first year as a Cup series crew chief, said Truex is maintaining an even keel. This is Truex's third Chase experience (best finish: 11th).\n\"I haven't noticed much change,\" Pearn said. \"Everybody is focused on picking it up a notch. There's a lot of stress in the Chase: Every decision you make has consequences.\"\nPearn, 33, has an engineering degree from the University of Waterloo, in Ontario. He grew up in a racing family and also played hockey. He still plays in a men's league in Denver, where the No. 78 Furniture Row team is based.\nBefore a race at Pocono 5 years ago, he attended a Chicago-Flyers Stanley Cup final game at the Wells Fargo Center. \"That's the loudest stadium I've ever been in,\" Pearn said. \"I'm a Toronto Maple Leafs fan: I've had a lifetime of pain.\" (Toronto hasn't won the Stanley Cup since 1967).\nNew rules for 2016 NASCAR yesterday announced a rules package for next year aimed at reducing downforce and increasing passing.\n\"The aero package that we're going ahead with for 2016 is similar to the one used at Kentucky Speedway and Darlington Raceway (this year),\" said Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR's executive vice president and chief racing development officer.\nThe package includes a 3 1/2-inch spoiler on the cars, a quarter-inch leading splitter edge and a 33-inch-wide radiator pan.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:19:07.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
