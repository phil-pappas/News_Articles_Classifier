A State Department spokesman said tens of thousands of Americans are believed to be vacationing in vulnerable areas.\nBut the Methes have been through this before.\n“We lived in Meraux for Katrina - been there my whole life,” Methe said. “We did not stay. We evacuated to western Louisiana. But we did lose our house, and everybody in our family lost everything and has been separated. It's stressful to know what could happen.”\nThe warning sirens in Puerta Villarta were too far for the Methes to hear, about an hour away from their resort, but resort officials urged guests to prepare for what could come.\n“There are 472 guests at the hotel currently about to be put in the room together,” Methe said. “It's two meeting rooms. They've boarded up the outside area of the hotel, they'll provide us with mattresses, pillows and blankets. They're doing everything to make us as comfortable as possible.”\nWeather reports from the National Weather Service in Mexico paint a grim picture of the damage that a storm packing winds of more than 200 mph can do.\n“Panic,” Methe said. “I was extremely scared - it took me for a surprise. I don't even know if I would have come on this trip if [I had known] it was a possibility.”\nMethe said the trip to Punta Mita was a reward trip for her husband’s company.\n“I guess the main concern is not the storm, but what happens afterwards if there is damage to the airport, because that's a lot further south than where we are,” Methe said.\nThe hurricane is forecast to make landfall in the Mexican state of Jalisco Friday evening as a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
