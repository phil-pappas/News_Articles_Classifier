Jones participated in both last Thursday's and Friday's practices and then played a key role in the win over the Seahawks with two punt returns and an interception. \nHall missed Wednesday's practice due to a back injury after coming out of the Seattle game in the second half. No official word was ever given why Hall left that game. \nTwo other players also did not participate in Wednesday's practice: offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth, who was given a veteran's day off as he has at least one day a week this season and did almost every week last season, and wide receiver Brandon Tate, who was sick. \nFour other players were limited participants in Wednesday's practice: wide receiver Marvin Jones (foot); cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick (hip); offensive tackle Andre Smith (elbow) and guard Kevin Zeitler (elbow). \nJones missed all of last season due to a broken foot and ankle problems. \nPhoto: Tony Tribble for Local.12 \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
