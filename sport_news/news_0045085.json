Rivers' 503 passing yards against the Green Bay Packers are the most in one game in San Diego history. His 43 completions rank as the second-most in one game in the history of the NFL. \nThe only trouble was the former Athens High School star needed one more completion. Defensive back Damarious Randall tipped away a fourth-down pass with San Diego at the Packers 3-yard line with 15 seconds remaining as Green Bay held on for a 27-20 victory. Rivers became the first player in NFL history to pass for 500 yards without throwing an interception in a loss. \nRivers moved the Chargers 77 yards with five straight completions to a first down at the Green Bay 3-yard line on San Diego's final series. But two running plays and two incompletions left the Chargers a loser to the undefeated Packers. Rivers was operating behind an offensive line missing three regulars and with another player, guard D.J. Fluker, nursing a sore ankle. \n\"We left plays out there that we normally make,\" Rivers said . \"Early on, that (what would have been) first touchdown to (Antonio) Gates, I missed. We usually make that one. A few other throws I usually make. That being said, we played a lot of them. It's one of those deals when, in games when you lose like this, those mistakes are magnified. When we hit however many we hit, you would've thought it's OK to miss a few, but not the ones we usually make. We should've scored 40. And that's what's frustrating.\" \nRivers, who entered the game leading the NFL in passing yards, completed 43-of-65 passes for 503 yards and two touchdowns. Another potential TD pass was dropped. \nRivers turned in the 17 th 500-yard passing game in NFL history. \n\"He's unbelievable,\" San Diego coach Mike McCoy said . \"He's a warrior. He's the best in the business.\" \nRivers' consecutive start streak is the fourth-longest for a quarterback in NFL history. Rivers has started every San Diego regular-season game since guiding the Chargers to a 27-0 victory over the Oakland Raiders on Sept. 11, 2006. The only QB streaks longer than Rivers' are the 297 games of Brett Favre, 208 of Peyton Manning and 172 of Eli Manning. Eli Manning's streak is ongoing with the New York Giants. \nRivers was among the 27 former Alabama high school or college players (that didn't play for Alabama or Auburn) who got on the field on the sixth Sunday of the NFL's 2015 season. \nOther state players who started on Sunday included defensive end Michael Johnson (Dallas County) of the Cincinnati Bengals, running back Isaiah Crowell ( Alabama State ) and fullback Malcolm Johnson (Northridge) of the Cleveland Browns, free safety Darian Stewart (Lee-Huntsville) of the Denver Broncos, running back Ameer Abdullah (Homewood) of the Detroit Lions, center Ben Jones (Bibb County) of the Houston Texans and cornerback Malcolm Butler ( West Alabama ) of the New England Patriots. \nRELATED: AUBURN NFL ROUNDUP \nCrowell ran for 32 yards on 11 carries and caught two passes for 9 yards in the Browns' 26-23 overtime loss to the Broncos. Stewart made five tackles in the game for Denver. \nAbdullah carried the ball 14 times for 48 yards, caught three passes for 21 yards and returned a kickoff 22 yards in the Lions' 37-34 overtime victory against the Chicago Bears. \nButler made eight tackles and broke up two passes in New England's 34-27 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. \nOther state players getting on the field on Sunday included Baltimore Ravens outside linebacker Za'Darius Smith (Greenville) and safety Brynden Trawick ( Troy ), Carolina Panthers defensive end Mario Addison (Tarrant, Troy), wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery (Phillips) and quarterback Joe Webb (Wenonah, UAB ); Bears safety Sherrod Martin (Troy), Browns safety Don Jones (Hazlewood), Colts outside linebacker Robert Mathis ( Alabama A&M ), Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackles Rakeem Nunez-Roches (Central-Phenix City) and Nick Williams (Minor, Samford ), Miami Dolphins cornerback Bobby McCain (Oxford), Minnesota Vikings cornerback Captain Munnerlyn (Murphy), New York Jets defensive tackle T.J. Barnes (Enterprise) and running back Zac Stacy (Bibb County), Pittsburgh Steelers nose tackle Steve McLendon (Carroll-Ozark, Troy), Chargers outside linebacker Cordarro Law (Sumter County), San Francisco 49ers safeties Jaquiski Tartt (Davidson, Samford) and Jimmie Ward (Davidson) and Washington Redskins defensive end Frank Kearse (Alabama A&M). \nCotchery had two receptions for 21 yards in Carolina's 27-23 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. He also made a tackle after a Seattle interception. \nWaived by the New Orleans Saints last week, Jones was claimed by the Browns and made two special-teams tackles in Cleveland's overtime loss to Denver. \nNunez-Roches made his NFL debut in Kansas City's 16-10 loss to Minnesota. \nStacy rushed 13 times for 46 yards, caught two passes for 15 yards and returned two kickoffs for 47 yards in the Jets' 34-20 victory over Washington. \nPackers tight end Kennard Backman (UAB) and cornerback LaDarius Gunter (Jeff Davis) and Seahawks quarterback Tarvaris Jackson (Sidney Lanier, Alabama State) did not play. \nArizona Cardinals wide receiver J.J. Nelson (Midfield, UAB), Ravens cornerback Lardarius Webb (Beauregard), Broncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware (Auburn High, Troy), Packers running back Alonzo Harris (Gadsden City), Patriots defensive end Trey Flowers (Columbia), Steelers guard Chris Hubbard (UAB) and Tennessee Titans nose tackle Sammie Lee Hill (West Blocton, Stillman ) were designated as inactive. Ware suffered a back injury in last week's game. \nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE \nThe Dallas Cowboys, Oakland Raiders, St. Louis Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers were on their bye weeks. \nThe sixth week of the NFL season concludes with the New York Giants visiting the Philadelphia Eagles at 7:30 p.m. CDT Monday.
