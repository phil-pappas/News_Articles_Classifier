The accessory keeps hands in the strike zone and also keeps hands inside the baseball. The device creates a shorter swing to the ball and generates faster bat speed. It exercises and strengthens the hands, wrists, forearms, triceps and biceps. Additionally, the invention turns the player into a better hitter. It can be used at all levels of baseball (T-ball to pros). Product samples are available.\nThe original design was submitted to the Orlando office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
