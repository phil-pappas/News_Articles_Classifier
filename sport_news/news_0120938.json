Posted by Ronnie Lott on Wednesday, September 30, 2015 Mark Purdy's blog SANTA CLARA -- Where are the leaders? \nColin Kaepernick was forced to be one Wednesday for the 49ers when he showed up for his required weekly meeting with the media. I wondered about his mindset after two weeks of being dominated and outscored 90-25 by opponents. Was he feeling anger? Frustration? Determination? \n\"I'm not too big on feelings,\" Kaepernick answered. \"Feelings aren't going to help me win a game. I'm focused on doing what I can to help this team win.\" \nIt's fine if Kaepernick has no feelings, I suppose. The 49ers' followers and paying customers are filling the gap quite nicely. They feel that the 49ers are in big trouble. They feel Kaepernick is regressing. They feel that new head coach Jim Tomsula is in need of some new ideas or new motivational tactics or new players.

I feel that this is a great time for the 49ers' leaders to show up and express confidence that Tomsula knows what he is doing and that the rest of the season can be salvaged. \nSo where are they? \nWhen the 49ers opened their Levi's Stadium locker room for the mandated 45-minute period on Wednesday, I wanted to see who was there and making himself available to set the attitudinal baseline in public. No request was made for team factotums to chase down any specific players in the training areas or other private rooms because I was curious to observe who would show up and volunteer to (A) answer questions and (B) take the opportunity to offer support for Tomsula and/or (C) Kaepernick. \nThe answer was almost nobody. Advertisement \nThe 49ers players elected their own captains before the season began. They chose nine players -- Kaepernick, Joe Staley, Vernon Davis, Anquan Boldin, NaVorro Bowman, Antoine Bethea, Eric Reid, Ian Williams and Phil Dawson -- to represent and symbolize the team. \nHere is how many of those nine players welcomed questions during Wednesday's open period: Reid and Dawson. Kaepernick did his interview earlier in the auditorium down the hall. \nOtherwise, the room was largely empty for the 45 minutes, save a few players who were not captains but who were involved in a table tennis game or fetching some items from their dressing cubicles or walking through on the way to the training room. \nIf you are keeping score at home, that is just 33 percent of the designated team leaders who stepped up to give their opinions about what has gone wrong and what they intend to do about it. \nThis did not offend me personally. Members of the media get paid the same whether or not players decide to make an appearance or answer questions. But the team's fans might want to hear from them. The NFL is the country's most popular sport with the largest media footprint, cultivated and promoted by the league. The players should be well aware how much their words are sought and heard and matter. \nIn fairness, it's possible that some of the other six captains might have walked through the room during the 45 minutes. I tried to pay close attention. But there were stretches when I was occupied taking notes as I listened to Reid and Torrey Smith. \nSmith, the wide receiver who came to the 49ers last spring as a free agent, is not a captain. But he made a point to face reporters and buttress Kaepernick, while also not glossing over how lousy the 49ers played against Pittsburgh and Arizona. \n\"You don't forget what happened,\" Smith said. \"It's like, you don't forget history. But you understand what happened and try to correct it.\" \nReid, in general, has been a stand-up guy since his arrival as a rookie from LSU two years ago. I posed to him the same question that I asked Kaepernick, about whether his prevailing mentality was anger or frustration or something else. \n\"I get frustrated with my own personal mistakes,\" said Reid, \"but not frustrated with the team by any means. This is the NFL. Things happen. You lose a couple of games, but we're only three games into the season. There's no reason to panic. We've got to play good football.\" \nWhat about Tomsula and his coaching staff? Is Reid confident that they are bringing good ideas and solutions to the table? \n\"I'm very confident,\" Reid said. \"I love our scheme defensively. I don't know much about the offense. But I'm sure the players love it over there, too.\" \nMaybe one day this week, more of the 49ers offensive mainstays will be at hand to overtly agree. For the record, lineman Alex Boone -- also not a captain -- did appear briefly for a few minutes at the very end of the open-locker-room period to assert that he supports Kaepernick and is glad that Kaepernick supports the offensive line, which has struggled. But that was it. \nWhere are the leaders? It is very possible that when the locker room isn't open, they are speaking up and boldly taking charge. But doing so in public is also necessary, to subvert any notion that things are falling apart. In the past 40 years, I have been around plenty of other sports and other teams in challenging situations. The best leaders practically demand to speak out and give fans a window into accountability and approach. \nBack in the day with the 49ers, the gold standard was Ronnie Lott, who even this week made an online video clip and demonstrated how that duty could be performed right now. Tim Brown did it for the Raiders. Carney Lansford was the man in that role for the championship A's teams of the late 1980s. Evgeni Nabokov was the stand-up guy in the Sharks' room. \nThe 49ers were not picked to make the playoffs this season by many folks. That includes me. But even with the departure of so many key veterans such as Justin Smith and Patrick Willis and Frank Gore, I fully expected some new leaders might surface to prove the skeptics wrong. \nWhere are they?
