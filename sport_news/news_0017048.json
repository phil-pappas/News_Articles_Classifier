It is part of a four-game stretch in 11 days to wrap up the exhibition tour.\nThe game will be at 3 p.m. Hawaii time and televised on Fox Sports 1. Ticket sales are pending.\n“When I took this job I was told of the importance of having a wide footprint in terms of where we bring the team to play and this first-ever game in Hawaii certainly stays true to that goal,” U.S. head coach Jill Ellis said in the release. “We always enjoy going to new markets and giving fans across the country, and in December across the Pacific Ocean, a chance to see the team play. I know the players and staff are very excited about going to Hawaii and we are looking forward to the experience of being on Oahu and playing this historic match against T&T at Aloha Stadium.”\nSince defeating Japan in the World Cup final on July 5, Team USA has played four friendlies, all victories against Costa Rica and Haiti.\nThose matches have featured big-name players such as Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan, Hope Solo, Megan Rapinoe and many of the other World Cup champs.\nBefore coming to Honolulu, the team is scheduled to play Brazil in Seattle then in Orlando, Fla., on Oct. 21 and 25.\nIn recent years, Aloha Stadium has hosted a handful of international soccer events. The Pan-Pacific Championship was held in 2008, won by Gamba Osaka over the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer. The event was rebranded the Hawaiian Islands Invitational and was last held in 2012.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:24:09.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
