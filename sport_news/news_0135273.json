The Lady Bulldogs moved their conference record to 8-0 and can assure themselves at least a tie for the title with a win at Vienna on Tuesday. CWC dominated Game 1. Eldorado called their first timeout after a kill by Abby Vaughan gave the Lady Bulldogs an 8-0 lead. The score was 13-2 and only Peighton Parks and Vaughan had served by the time Lixi Wheeler was able to enter the game on her regular rotation into the front line. The lead grew to 20-3 before Eldorado called their second timeout. They stopped CWC’s momentum for a time and came back to 24-12 before a dig from Paige Winter, a set by Maggi Ackerman and a kill from Wheeler ended Game 1. Game 2 played more evenly at evenly at the start with CWC only clinging to a 12-11 lead before they began the game-clinching run. Good passing a strong play at the net moved the lead to 20-13 and eventually to a 25-18 final.
