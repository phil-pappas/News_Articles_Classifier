Marie football team started slow and finished slow, but boy, in between that area he was pretty pleased. The Blue Devils ended a three-game road trip by overcoming Gladstone 37-27 here Friday night at Marble Athletic Field. It gives Sault a 4-2 record with the non-conference victory and puts them within two wins of earning a postseason playoff berth. “If we stay healthy, I like our chances,” said Menard, indicating he figured his club had a good chance to reach six wins before the season began. Sault hosts Cheboygan in homecoming next Friday. It was Gladstone’s homecoming Friday but the Braves did not have much to celebrate, although first-year coach Jeff Hansen still found some things to be happy about as the Braves prepare to visit bayshore rival Escanaba next Friday. “The kids are sad they lost this game, but they will have their chins up knowing they played quality football against a quality team,” said Hansen. “It stinks to lose, but we showed better execution and courage and desire to keep going. That shows the character of this team. We have a ton of stuff to build on from this game. “This was the best football game we played this year on both sides of the ball.” That observation comes despite the fact the Braves (2-4) yielded 441 yards of total offense, including 350 on the ground. “They rip off big chunks of yardage,” said Hansen. “They got us a couple of times.” The biggest chunk came on a 77-yard run by Tristan Johnston, which came on his first carry of the game early in the fourth quarter that vaulted Sault to a 34-13 cushion. “Our quarterback (Nicholas LaCross) did a great job blocking downfield,” Menard said of running the reverse to the left side, with Johnston dashing down the sideline before darting back inside and then back to the corner. His performance, and that of junior Ryan Jones, was satisfying for Menard because the Blue Devils played the second half with senior Justin Fountain on the bench nursing a sprained ankle. “We played the side of caution,” Menard said of resting Fountain, who ran for 136 yards on just nine first-half carries. He also had a 19-yard touchdown run into the right corner after rejecting a tackle bid by Gladstone’s Matt Chenier at the three-yard line. “He has been our horse,” Menard said. “We’re not a one-trick pony. We get a lot of contributions from all of our guys.” Another major contribution came from senior Hunter Krause, who intercepted two passes and recovered an onside kick. His second pick came in the end zone when he jumped in front ofJake Greenfield to steal Ben Schwalbach’s pass on the second play of the fourth quarter. Gladstone was trailing 27-13 at the time, with Owen Carlson showing some quickness on a pair of runs that gained a total of 42 yards to put the Braves in a threatening position. Page 2 of 3 - “That was a gut punch turnover in the end zone,” said Hansen. “And so was that long run (by Johhnston two plays later that sent Sault ahead 34-13). Momentum is rough when you have it and get punched in the gut.” Gladstone made the final score respectable with two touchdowns in the final 2:47. First Schwalbach hit Greenfield on a 50-yard scoring pass, then Kostya Torvinen recovered a Sault fumble three plays later to give the Braves possession at Sault’s 27. With 13 seconds left, Schwalbach scrambled back from the shotgun position to retrieve a high snap, then cut upfield right through the heart of Sault’s reserve defense for the end zone. He was credited with a two-yard run but he actually ran closer to 15 yards. While Menard was disappointed in his team’s slow start, the Braves had even a tougher time getting underway. They only gained 74 yards and had three first downs in the first half. “We struggled to find what was going to work for us,” said Hansen. Gladstone’s comeback hopes were derailed further just two plays into the second half when running back Hunter Garling sustained a sprained ankle on a short gain. “He got rolled up on the tackle,” said Hansen, indicating his condition will be monitored next week. Garling, probably Gladstone’s best player, left the field on crutches. Garling barged in for Gladstone’s first score that tied the game at 7-7 early in the second quarter. Sault responded by scoring twice in less than three minutes to take control, with Fountain breaking the deadlock followed by a Refrigerator Perry type touchdown, a one-yard blast by 260-pound senior guard Chase Bouschor with 5:17 left in the half. It was the third carry of the season and his first touchdown on a play the Blue Devils have practiced. “He is built low to the ground and has good leg drive,” Menard said of his third-year starter who was told he would get a shot when the ball gets inside the three-yard line. “He has been begging to do it for three years.” Gladstone came out of the intermission strong, using just six plays to hit paydirt when Greenfield made a leaping grab of Schwalbach’s 10-yard pass in the left corner for a touchdown that cut the deficit to 21-13. But Sault regained the upper hand with an impressive 13-play drive that covered 58 yards, with Jones plowing in from a yard out with 1:19 left in the third quarter for a 27-13 lead.
