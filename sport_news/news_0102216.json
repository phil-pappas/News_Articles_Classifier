The final score suggests a routine victory, finally, by a team that most expected to romp through the American League Division Series, but like each game between these two teams, it was far from easy. \nIn three straight innings in the early going, Toronto put the leadoff man on second base. Twice, the Blue Jays loaded the bases with less than one out. At one point, Rangers starter Martin Perez walked three consecutive batters. And with all of the potential fireworks given the Jays’ potent lineup, all they had to show for four innings of rallies was but two runs. \nHow did they accomplish this odd feat? They did it by hitting into double plays four innings in a row — and creatively, too. Sure, a couple of them were of the routine ground ball variety, but one saw Texas second baseman Rougned Odor stab a liner and double Kevin Pillar off third base, while Chris Colabello squelched a glorious chance with the rare 3-2-3 double play in the sixth inning. By the time Colabello had completed his jog up the first-base line, it looked like Toronto was about to douse another conflagration with flame-retardant foam. Manager John Gibbons allowed that, after the fourth double play, “you wonder what’s going on here, you go ‘maybe this isn’t meant to be’.” \nBut Tulowitzki, the stellar slugger who had been mostly quiet with the bat since arriving at the trade deadline in late July, and who had been hitless in this post-season, then stepped up and ended all kinds of poor streaks. He worked Texas reliever Chi Chi Gonzalez to a 3-2 count and then roped a shot over the left-field wall. Off the bat, the only question was whether it would stay high enough to reach the seats. It did, but just barely. \nIt was the hit that the Blue Jays had been waiting four days to deliver, and which had been such a staple of their late-season surge: the shot that cracked the game open. \n“It was awesome,” said Josh Donaldson of the feeling in the Toronto dugout after the Tulowitzki homer. “We’d been needing that big blow.” \n“Tulo needed that, he really did,” manager John Gibbons said after the game. He wondered if, with a walk and two hits on Sunday, the shortstop would finally start hitting the way he has over the course of his career. If he does, the Toronto lineup becomes flat-out unmerciful. Or, as Gibbons put it: “If he catches fire, we’re real dangerous.” \nAnd now, despite still trailing 2-1 in the series, it is the Blue Jays that can point to a number of positive trends: they have had hits from all of their usual contributors, and Estrada’s sharp work — six-plus innings on 89 pitches — allowed Gibbons to be economical with this bullpen, keeping a lot of arms fresh for Game 4. Toronto will also have R.A. Dickey starting in that matchup, which means the 40-year-old who is pitching for the first time in the playoffs in his 13-year career will get the benefit of the stifling Texas heat. It is forecast to be 35C at 3 p.m. local time, when Game 4 is scheduled to start, and Dickey says his knuckleball gets a little extra dart and swoop in the heat and humidity. He first developed the knuckler in 2005, when he was with the Rangers. (Dickey said the full-circle aspect of getting his first playoff start in Arlington is “a little poetic.”)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:44:05.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
