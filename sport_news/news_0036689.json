McGee left the University of Louisville in 2014 to join the UMKC staff.\nMcGee also played for Pitino, who has denied any knowledge of the sex parties.\n\"I don't know if any of this is true or not,\" Pitino told ESPN's Dana O'Neil by phone Tuesday. \"There's only one person who knows the truth, and he needs to come out and tell the truth to his teammates, to the University of Louisville, to his fans and to his coaches that have taught him to do the right thing for years and allowed him to be part of something special here.\n\"He's the only one with any answers. Whether it's true or not, I don't know. ... Everything else is absurd. I don't care about the legal issues. If he's done something wrong, he has to own up to it and do his penance.\"\nMcGee has been silent, but his attorney, Scott Cox, has slammed the book making the allegations.\n\"I can tell you that all the evidence we've looked at supports his version of events, which is that he never paid her or anyone else to have sex with a player or a recruit,\" Cox said.\nCox's comments came as one of the escorts detailed her conversations with McGee about negotiating prices for escorts and the type of girl that a recruit wanted.\nThe escort said McGee told her that Pitino was aware of the sex parties.\n\"To say I'm disheartened and disappointed would be probably the biggest understatement I've made since I've been a coach,\" Pitino said.\nUMKC basketball coach Kareem Richardson, who was an assistant coach on Louisville's national championship team in 2013, said his team is focused on the upcoming season.\n\"The ultimate goal is to win a championship, the regular season first and foremost and then hopefully to win a conference championship,\" Richardson said.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
