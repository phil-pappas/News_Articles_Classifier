( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer ) \nUniversity of Colorado soccer coach Danny Sanchez isn't quite ready to call it desperation time just yet. \nThat said, his Buffaloes find themselves mired in a frustrating scoring drought while staring at a daunting uphill climb in the Pac-12 Conference race. With five games remaining, CU sits in a tie for 10th place in the league. \nGiven the Pac-12 sent nine teams to the NCAA tournament last season, the math is becoming precariously simplistic for the Buffs heading into a weekend trip to Southern California to take on UCLA (Friday) and No. 24 USC (Sunday). \n\"We need to get something positive out of the weekend,\" Sanchez said. \"If we focus on playing well, we'll be competitive. We're not looking too far into the future.\" \nFirst atop CU's to-do list is solving the mystery of the team's prolonged scoring drought. The Buffs haven't recorded a goal in the run of play since a tally by Brittney Stark in the 40th minute of an eventual overtime win against Cal on Sept. 27. \nSince then, the Buffs have scored a pair of goals off corner kicks and received another last week on an own-goal at Stanford off a free kick. CU has gone roughly 535 minutes without registering a goal in the regular run of play, going 0-4-1 since the win against Cal. \nStill, time hasn't run out yet on the Buffs to control their NCAA tournament fate. At least not yet. Advertisement \n\"There's not an easy game. Not in the Pac-12,\" Sanchez said. \"I'm hoping Stanford was an anomaly, because they're not giving up anything to anyone. If we didn't have the personnel, that would be one thing. But we know we have the personnel.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:03:20.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
