(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) Tweet \nThe Bruins haven’t yet delivered a solid 60-minute effort at home this season, but they continue to be a very impressive road team. \nFacing an New York Islanders club that’s seen by many a top Eastern Conference Cup contenders -- and took the ice riding a four-game winning streak -- the Bruins shook off a sluggish start Friday night to top the Isles, 5-3, in their first game at the Barclays Center. The B’s improved to 3-0-0 on the road this season. \nJonas Gustavsson was the slightly surprising starter in nets for the Bruins, and won for the second time with a solid showing. He was backed by an excellent effort from his mates, who checked the Islanders relentlessly, which forced numerous turnovers – and at least three B’s goals. \nThe B’s came in having allowed 26 goals in six games, but gave a fine defensive effort in this one – which led to most of their offense. \nBrett Connolly (No. 2) opened the scoring in the first period, but the B’s quickly fell behind 2-1 after one. But then goals by Jonas Kemppainen (1) and David Pastrnak (2) highlighted an outstanding second period by the Bruins, who claimed a 3-2 lead. \nRyan Spooner (2) made it 4-2 early in the third, with the B’s looking like a more and more confident team. David Krejci (5; seven-game scoring streak) added an empty-net goal with 2:25 left. \n“The goals we’re giving up, and the amount of goals we’re giving up, (are) concerning,” said Bruin Chris Kelly. “But I think there’s a bright side that we are scoring goals, we are creating chances. Defense is work. If we come to work every night, those goals (against) will go down.” \nThe Bruins really worked in this one. \nAs has been the case in several games, the night started fairly well for the Bruins, who grabbed a 1-0 lead on Connolly’s goal 9:51 in. On the play, linemates Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand were doing good work on the forecheck in the right corner of the New York zone. \nThe puck was poked loose and slid toward the right net-front. Connolly, who’d been on the far side of the zone, showed good quickness hopping on the loose puck and popping it past Isles goalie Jaroslav Halak, high-glove. \nMarchand was whistled off for hooking defenseman Nick Leddy at 12:50. The B’s had a terrific shorthanded opportunity to double their lead, as Chris Kelly and Loui Eriksson broke out 2-on-1. Eriksson carried down the right side and had his backhander kicked aside by Halak. \nSeconds later, Gustavsson made a save on Isles star John Tavares’ bid from the right circle, but left a deadly rebound to the other side — where Josh Bailey waited to rap home the easy score. \nThe Islanders claimed a 2-1 lead at 15:27, when center Casey Cizikas skated to the net-front, with Ryan Spooner covering him, but not tightly enough, and steered in a pass from Johnny Boychuk, who’d pinched down the right boards. \nAn instant after the puck went in, Adam McQuaid and Matt Martin dropped the gloves for a heavyweight bout that was nothing special. \nOutplayed in the opening 20 minutes, the Bruins responded with a much stronger and heavier effort in the second, pressuring the home team hard in its own end and allowing few uncontested breakouts. Again and again, Isles players turned over the puck as they tried to escape their zone. Several times, all they could so was dump the puck out — and ice it 3-4 times. \nThe Bruins’ hard work was finally rewarded when Joonas Kemppainen tied the game at 16:13. It was his forecheck that forced an Islanders turnover, with Spooner intercepting a panicked pass high in the Isles’ zone. His shot from mid-slot was blocked, but the puck bounced perfectly to Kemppainen in the right circle. He fired in a forehander before Halak could move over. \nThe B’s kept the heat on, and at 18:16, Isles defenseman Calvin DeHaan, under pressure in front of his own cage, blindly cleared a rebound right onto the stick of Pastrnak in the right circle. His quick forehander beat Halak and the B’s took a 3-2 lead at the end of a terrific Period 2.
