Nicholson connected with Dwayne McLaurin for a 42-yard pass, then ran the ball the final yard to cap the day's scoring. \nNicholson and Mervo coach Patrick Nixon said it was important to get a jump on the Clippers. \n\"They're a running team, so it's difficult for them to catch up once they get behind,\" Nixon said. \"We knew it was important for us to get up on them early and force them to pass and get a little bit away from their running game. That was huge for us.\" \nPatterson had its best chance to score early in the second half after Booker recovered a fumble inside Mervo's 40-yard line. With their only sustained drive of the game, the Clippers reached the 15 in eight plays before a couple of penalties set them back to the 30. They would turn the ball over on downs. \nPenalties hurt both teams, and Nixon knows mistakes must be cleaned up as the Mustangs prepare to host Dunbar on Friday night. \n\"That's something all year that we've been harping on, talking about, and we're going to continue to work on. The penalties stopped at least two or three drives today, and so we know we have to work on that as far as being more disciplined and focused,\" Nixon said. \nThe Clippers return to the field Thursday night at Poly for the Roger Wrenn Classic, named in honor of the Baltimore City fixture who coached both programs before retiring in 2011 after 40 years and 285 wins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:42:17.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
