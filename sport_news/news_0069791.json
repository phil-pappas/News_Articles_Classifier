Scored a goal against Susan Wagner in the 'A' playoff bracket final last year to help lead the Commodores to a 3-1 victory.\nMY FAVORITES\nMovie: Moulin Rouge\n\"I've seen it so many times, it's not even funny. I love musicals, I love the whole romance kind of thing.\"\nFood: Pasta and noodles\n\"Anything with carbs. I like lo mein, fettucine alfredo, anything like that.\"\nTV Show: One Tree Hill\n\"I feel like I can really relate to it, there's a lot of voice-over which I really like. It's really well done, and the plot is really interesting.\"\nDream Date: Orlando Bloom\n\"I've had a crush on him since sixth grade. If I went out with him I would pass out or something.\"\nRole Models: My parents\n\"Definitely my parents. They are the ones who taught me all my morals that I live by today, they've supported me, and I look up to them so much.\"\nMusic: Paramore\n\"They are just really catchy. I'm a lyric kind of girl, so I'm really into their lyrics. The lead singer is a female, and I'm really into that.\"\nHoliday: Christmas\n\"That's the one where you get presents and you get to spend time with your family, so it's the best.\"\nDream Car: Mercedes convertible\n\"I've always wanted one, in silver or red. I would love to drive with the top down and cruise to the beach.\"\nMY Quote: ON THIS YEAR'S BAYSIDE SQUAD\n\"I think, since it's a brand new team, it's a new experience, and it's fun. It's a challenge playing with people who I haven't played with before. I moved to sweeper this year from left midfield, so that's also been an adjustment. It's getting easier though.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:37:36.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
