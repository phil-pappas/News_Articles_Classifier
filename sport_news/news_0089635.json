With the Schadens stepping aside, race organizers now are pursuing a new ownership model: a large collection of community-based and national investors — not just a single family — that will give the race the long-term viability that draws even more investors, said race chief Shawn Hunter. \"People want to know there's a plan for long-term success and they want to see a homegrown ownership group. Having more than one individual in charge is a good thing,\" Hunter said. \"I think there are a lot of people here in Colorado who will be a part of this group and some people on the national level who have watched what we have built and want to be a part of it. The goal is not just raising money. We want strategic investors who understand this opportunity and are willing to grow it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:17:30.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
