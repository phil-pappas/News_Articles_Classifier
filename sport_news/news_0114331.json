(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) \nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Connor Cook threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns, and No. 7 Michigan State remained undefeated with a 52-26 win over Indiana on Saturday. \nCook fell just short of the school record of 400 yards passing, set by Bill Burke in 1999 against Michigan. The Spartans (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) never trailed in the second half of this one, but it was touch and go until Cook found R.J. Shelton for a 10-yard touchdown pass with 4:57 remaining to give Michigan State a 12-point lead. \nThe Spartans then tacked on two more TDs to avoid an upset a week after their unforgettable win at Michigan. Michigan State has won 12 in a row for the first time since 1956. This run is tied for the third-longest winning streak in school history. \nIndiana (4-4, 0-4) was outscored 24-0 in the fourth quarter. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:41:01.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
