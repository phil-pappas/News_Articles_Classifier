John , The Desert Sun 10 p.m. PDT October 17, 2015 Football tableau CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPalm Springs handily defeated La Quinta to further solidify the top overall spot in the rankings, and Coachella Valley rebounded from a blowout loss to the Indians to take a giant jump a with a win over Xavier Prep on Friday. It’s time for another edition of the weekly Desert Sun power rankings, and there’s been a bit of movement heading into the final weeks of the regular season. \n1. Palm Springs (last week No. 1): The Indians, 7-0, looked every bit a CIF title contender Friday against La Quinta, the reigning Desert Valley League champions. This week’s game against Palm Desert will be no picnic, particularly without injured senior Franklin Miller, but there’s certainly reason to believe Palm Springs will be the favorite to win the Eastern Division crown once again. \n2. Palm Desert (last week No. 2): Palm Desert, 4-3, will have its toughest test of the season this week at home against Palm Springs, but it’s quite possible this game could be much closer to most anticipate. The Aztecs have a strong rushing attack, one of the better defenses in the valley and the quarterback situation seems to be sorting itself out with sophomore Matthew Fitzgerald settling in. \n3. Rancho Mirage (last week No. 3): At 6-2 and with three consecutive wins, the Rattlers are rolling along nicely. A home game against Yucca Valley this week could have the second year program at seven wins heading into the final week at Shadow Hills for a shot at the school’s first postseason berth. \n4. Shadow Hills (last week No. 6): There’s a good chance the Knights still haven’t played their best game of the year, though they came close in a blowout win over a much improved Yucca Valley squad. Shadow Hills has arguably the best rushing attack in the valley, a surging defense and a transfer quarterback who can be dangerous once he gets going. \n5. La Quinta (last week No. 4): Despite a number of blowout losses to some of the better teams in Southern California, La Quinta, 3-5, is still a likely playoff team and has the weapons to maybe even surprise someone. It may be a rebuilding year, but the Blackhawks still have a lot left to play for. \n6. Desert Hot Springs (last week No. 5): The Golden Eagles, 5-2, are the surprise team of the year in the Coachella Valley, and have one of the more balanced offensive attacks with a strong defense, but they have yet to play their three of their four toughest opponents. Can they keep it going? If they can, they’ll rocket up the rankings. \n7. Coachella Valley (last week No. 9): The Arabs have been up and down, at 4-3, but have won four of five and are making a playoff push. CV will likely need to beat Palm Desert or La Quinta to have a shot at the postseason, but there’s some hope, particularly after defeating Xavier Prep at home on Friday. \n8. Desert Chapel (last week No. 7): The Eagles rebounded in a big way Friday after their first loss of the season, which was a blowout to rival Joshua Springs. They should enter the postseason with just the one loss. \n9. Xavier Prep (last week No. 10): The Saints lost a crucial game to CV on Friday, but still have a lot to play for. Despite some recent losses in the DVL, the Saints have an outside shot at the postseason if they can finish the regular season strong. \n10. Desert Mirage (last week No. 11): Wheels have fallen off of the Desert Mirage bandwagon after the Rams lost their fifth consecutive game Friday at Rancho Mirage. DM won its first three games of he season in convincing fashion, but will need to win their last two in order to match last season’s 5-5 record. \n11. Desert Christian Academy (last week No. 8): The Conquerors have a shot to make some noise in the postseason, despite starting the season with two losses and losing big to Desert Chapel. DCA seems to be making a strong push to the finish line. \n12. Indio (last week No. 13): The Rajahs have looked a lot better this year, but there’s still room for growth. Further evidence of that came last week in a blowout loss to Palm Desert. But there’s a decent chance of getting that elusive second win of the season this Friday against Cathedral City. \n13. Cathedral City (last week No. 13): The struggles continue for Cathedral City, a team that is incredibly young and has been bit by the injury bug. Their only real shot to get a win this season will be against Indio this week, unless they can somehow manage to pull a major upset against Palm Springs. \n14. Palm Valley (last week No. 14): The Firebirds have had a difficult time again this season, and it won’t get any easier with tough opponents who will be fighting for postseason berths to close out the regular season. But the two wins they have is surely a stepping stone in the program’s first season under George Thomas.
