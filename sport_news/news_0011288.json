The loud cheer wasn't to celebrate Atallah's elimination, but for the bronze medal that Jitu Rai secured.\nThe pistol final was a rollercoaster ride for the eight finalists, which eventually saw Iran's Safari Boroujeni win gold with 198.7 points. The silver went to another Indian, Gurpreet Singh, who shot 197.6. Jitu shot 155.3.\nJitu was on the verge of getting eliminated before the 16th shot as he stood fourth after hitting a 9.2 in his 15th shot. Atallah was second, while Safari held the lead and Gurpreet was third. A 10 could have kept Atallah at second position and pushed Jitu out of the final, but the young shooter couldn't take the noise surge from the crowd.\nGold was out of India's reach as Safari's consistent shooting put him in lead after 10 shots, while Jitu and Gurpreet struggled to maintain the flow of good shots. Another Indian, Omkar Singh was the first to get eliminated. He was tied with Iran's Ahmadi Mohammad for the last spot, but the Irani shoo ter shot a 10.1 in the shoot-off, while Omkar hit 9.9. Earlier, Safari entered the final by scoring 574 in the qualifying round. Jitu hit an impressive 583, Gurpreet 576, while Omkar shot 575.\nThe Indians totaled 1,734 for team gold, while Kazakhstan won silver with 1,722. There was no bronze, since there were only three teams in contention. It was 1-2 for India in the junior men final as India's Sumedh Kumar won gold (199.1) and Hemendra Kushwah (195.2) clinched silver. The bronze went to Bangladesh's Ahmed Mohamad with 175.2. In the youth category , Mohit Gaur took bronze (176), while the gold went to Iran's Sayed Jamal Mousavi (200.4) and silver to Chinese Taipei's Chao Yi-Chun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:48:56.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
