(Photo: James Lang, USA TODAY Sports)\nA few additional fantasy nuggets to help owners set their Week 4 lineups, including injuries, sit/start matchup and the stats of the week.\nInjury report\nWR Eric Decker, Jets (questionable)\nDidn’t play in Week 3 because of a knee injury, but early kickoff in London will help fantasy owners adjust.\nQB Andrew Luck, Colts (probable)\nSore shoulder doesn’t appear to be a big deal for Sunday, but he’ll likely take it easy the rest of the week in practice.\nWR Sammy Watkins, Bills (questionable)\nCalf injury doesn’t seem to be getting better. He’ll likely face Giants cover corner Prince Amukamara if he does play.\nRB DeMarco Murray, Eagles (questionable)\nHe’s had a full week to rest his hamstring, but Ryan Mathews and Darren Sproles have been effective in his place.\nWR Victor Cruz, Giants (doubtful)\nThis looked like it might have been the week for Cruz’s season debut, but his ailing calf flared up in practice.\nWR DeSean Jackson, Redskins (questionable)\nStill isn’t moving well enough to practice, which could mean another week on the sidelines – and no deep threat for Kirk Cousins.\nQB Drew Brees, Saints (questionable)\nShoulder seems to be responding well, as evidenced by him working with the first-team on Wednesday.\nRB Marshawn Lynch, Seahawks (questionable)\nMonday night game makes waiting for his hamstring to heal an even riskier play – unless you also have backup Thomas Rawls.\n-- Steve Gardner, USA TODAY Sports\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 4 fantasy football rankings\nKey matchup\nSTART: WR Marvin Jones, Bengals\nJones had 94 receiving yards in Week 3 and has scored in back-to-back games. He gets a Kansas City Chiefs secondary that's allowed 57 receptions and nine touchdowns to wide receivers. His $3,800 salary in FantasyScore is an absolute steal.\nSIT: WR John Brown, Cardinals\nOutside of a touchdown catch in Week 1, Brown hasn't lived up to the hype. It's been the Larry Fitzgerald show Arizona and Brown can't be trusted anymore. Plus, the St. Louis Rams have allowed just one touchdown to wideouts this year. Brown isn't worth the $4,400 FantasyScore.com investment in Week 4.\n— Marc Caviglia, BrunoBoys.net\nFANTASYSCORE\nFantasyScore 1-Day Fantasy Leagues\nStats of the week\n5\nRushing touchdowns from inside the 10-yard line for Atlanta Falcons RB Devonta Freeman, which ties him with Jamaal Charles of the Kansas City Chiefs for the most in the NFL after three weeks.\n-- Tony Holm, FantasySharks.com\n215\nTeam-high receiving yards for Dallas Cowboys running back Lance Dunbar. PPR owners take note: He’s caught 21 of his 23 targets, both of which lead all NFL running backs.\n-- Ken Pomponio, TheHuddle.com\nhe matchups for Week 4 in the NFL with each team's offensive and defensive ranking.
