Glendale is unlike any team you will see because it has no running back. They pass on every single down, their only rushing yards come from their quarterback. While they have a 2-6 record, they have put up at least 40 points six times. In addition to using no running back, they also kick onside every time, which puts their defense in some rough spots. \n“Their defense isn’t really that bad,” Shore said. “They put themselves in a lot of bad spots because they onside kick it every time and give the other team a short field.” \nFor a Laker team that has struggled to score, particularly in the red zone, this becomes a very interesting game. Camdenton has found a lot of success on longer plays this year. When things tighten up and they get closer to the endzone, they’ve been slowed down. Because Glendale will likely give them the ball pretty close to the end zone, Camdenton will need to improve on scoring on shorter plays. \n“The problem with them is, they’re gonna score a lot of points on whoever they play,” Shore said. “It’s a matter of can you score enough points to go along with it and we’ve had a hard time scoring points.” \nWhile they have struggled to score, the Lakers have found a lot of success overall offensively. Jay Griffin has been a standout in the backfield for the Lakers and quarterback Dyllan Decker has improved as the season has progressed. Those two will just need to improve on getting touchdowns when it counts. \nOn the defensive side, Camdenton has faced pass-heavy teams this season, but none like Glendale. \nBecause there is no real running threat, the defense will make some adjustments. Glendale quarterback Alex Huston has been incredible this season for Glendale, so the secondary will have their hands full. He has thrown for 4,100 yards and 47 touchdowns this season. But he has also thrown 18 interceptions, so the Laker secondary will need to find their opportunities to get turnovers. To adjust to a team that doesn’t run much, Shore will basically take out his defensive line and play with linebackers, corners and safeties. With this sort of offense, you don’t need run-stuffers, you need speed. More Camdenton players will likely be playing both ways this week, so conditioning may become a factor. \n“Literally you don’t need any defensive linemen in this game,” Shore said. “It’s an odd deal where we’ll use more of our defensive backs and linebackers and very few of our defensive linemen will play.” \nWhen it’s all said and done, this game won’t have a huge effect on the Lakers. They will be playing Waynesville in districts regardless of the outcome, according to Shore, so this becomes about wanting to play well for the seniors on Senior night and wanting to carry momentum into the postseason. \n“Very rarely do you play last game of the season and you don’t have much riding on it because you kinda know what’s going on in the playoffs,” Shore said. “It’s gonna be Senior Night and our last home game for a while.” \nCamdenton hosts Glendale - Updates on Twitter: @lkrathletics .
