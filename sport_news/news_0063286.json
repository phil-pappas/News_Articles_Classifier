If the Spartans want to challenge for the West title, this is a game they need to win. \n\"As you continue winning, the bar gets raised,\" Caragher said. \"I use the analogy we're climbing the mountain. With that win, we moved our base camp a little higher up the mountain. The higher you get, the steeper the climb is.\" \nIt's a far different scenario than a year ago, when SJSU had dropped five in a row entering its season finale at San Diego State and lost 38-7. Caragher called the game \"a distant memory,\" but said it served to motivate his team throughout the offseason. \n\"It's a painful experience when you're on the wrong end of those lopsided scores,\" he said. \"It was a game we definitely had to look in the mirror after that (to see) where we're at and what we're doing. Advertisement \n\"I think our team responded well in the offseason. We know we're playing a good team. What a great opportunity we have.\" \n-- The Spartans have clarity at quarterback after junior Kenny Potter confirmed his status as the starter with a strong outing at UNLV. Potter, back in the lineup after missing the two previous games with an ankle injury, was intercepted on SJSU's first series, then cleaned up his game. \n\"Kenny really came up big,\" Caragher said. \"We all saw he was rusty in the first quarter. But he really answered the call after that first quarter. I'm encouraged by how Kenny has played.\" \nPotter was 30 for 48 for 329 yards with two touchdowns and the interception. He also ran three times for 33 yards and a TD. Senior Joe Gray, who had played well in the two previous games, is the backup. \n-- SJSU senior running back Tyler Ervin remains the nation's No. 2 rusher with 874 yards, trailing only LSU's Leonard Fournette, who has 1,022 yards. Ervin is fourth in yards per game at 145.7 and tied for third with 11 rushing touchdowns. \nIf he gains 126 yards against the Aztecs, Erwin would become just the fourth Mountain West player to reach 1,000 in his seventh game of the season. \n-- Linebacker Christian Tago left the locker room Saturday wearing a protective boot on his right foot, but Caragher said it was purely precautionary and he will be cleared to practice Tuesday. \n-- Fans can check out the five Super Bowl trophies won by the 49ers and three by the Raiders on Saturday at Spartan Stadium's east field as part of The Tour 50: Champions of the Bay exhibit. The event is free and the trophies will be on display from 3:30 to 7:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:35:24.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
