Carolina 45-21 \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. – A week after finally taking down almost-rival Seattle, the Carolina Panthers return to the friendly confines of Bank of America Stadium for a nationally televised showdown with the suddenly relevant Philadelphia Eagles. \nCarolina comes into Sunday's game 5-0 for just the second time in franchise history. The last time the Panthers were 5-0, they wound up in the Super Bowl, winning the franchise's only NFC Championship to date. Philadelphia comes into the Queen City on a high note as well, dominating the New York Giants 27-7 last Monday night. The Eagles have taken advantage of their divisional foes' troubles, rebounding from an 0-2 start with two convincing wins in a row. \nPerhaps the biggest storyline coming into this game is the ability of Cam Newton to continue to win with subpar talent at the skill positions. With Kelvin Benjamin out for the season with a knee injury, Ted Ginn has attempted to step in as the team's No. 1 wide receiver option. Ginn has hauled in just 13 receptions for 224 yards and three scores. \nGreg Olsen has established himself as one of the league's best tight ends with two 100-yard games this season. Olsen tallied 131 yards on seven catches and the game-winning score at Seattle. Olsen had a career-high 134 yards and two touchdowns in week three against New Orleans. Olsen is currently fifth in receiving yards among tight ends with 374 yards, just 51 behind New England's Rob Gronkowski. Bell Tolls: Cam Newton a clutch closer for Carolina Panthers \nAfter facing a banged-up Cam Newton last season, Philadelphia's Chip Kelly is expecting a different quarterback on the field this week. \n\"I think we faced a different Cam,\" Kelly said. \"Cam had an ankle injury last year. He looks like he is very healthy this year.\" \nLast year, Philly's defense sacked Newton a staggering nine times and forced four turnovers from Newton. Newton has turned the ball over just four times this season, with the fifth-year quarterback putting an emphasis on taking care of the football. Against a Philadelphia defense that thrives on turnovers, Newton knows a repeat of last season is unacceptable. \n\"That was a lack of execution on all fronts. I can only speak for myself when I say that I threw the ball up for grabs too many times,\" Newton said. \"That's not a recipe for winning football.\" \nIf the Eagles are going to have success against a feisty Carolina defense, they'll need another solid performance from DeMarco Murray. Murray, who led the league in rushing in 2014, rushed for a measly 47 yards in the team's first three games. The former Oklahoma running back has started to regain his form recently, topping the century mark for total yards in back-to-back games. The Panthers have taken notice, too. \n\"I think they got in a groove and DeMarco looked great,\" said Luke Kuechly. \"You also have Sproles in there, who I've played against a few times, so I think each guy has a little bit of a different style of running, and I think that's something that's a challenge.\" Eagles coach Kelly plans to face a 'different' Cam Newton Sunday night \nThe Panthers rushing attack is no slouch, themselves. Led by Jonathan Stewart, Carolina's ground game pounded Seattle for 135 yards, a season-high allowed by the Seahawks. Stewart finished the game with 78 yards and a pair of touchdowns, his first multi-touchdown game since 2009. The Panthers have rushed for at least 100 yards in 16 consecutive games. \n\"They don't get real fancy, but they are physical and they don't make a lot of mistakes,\" said Philadelphia linebacker DeMeco Ryans. \"We know what they like to do and they do it well.\" \nCarolina's pass rush will get some help with Jared Allen returning to the lineup Sunday night. Allen missed last week's game at Seattle while dealing with a pinched nerve in his back. Ron Rivera is optimistic that missing just one game will keep the rust off of the experienced Allen. \n\"He worked very hard to try to maintain his conditioning, so I don't think the one week off will hurt him,\" Rivera said. \"He had a real good week of building it back up. It was good to see.\" \nPhiladelphia quarterback Sam Bradford has seen his fair share of struggles in 2015. The former St. Louis Ram has been uncomfortable at times in Chip Kelly's offense, throwing multiple interceptions in four games this year. Last week against the Giants, Bradford threw three picks, but Philadelphia's defense created four turnovers to bail out Bradford. \n\"Would I have liked to be a little sharper? Absolutely,\" Bradford said Thursday. \"But at the same time, I think I've done some things really well, and I'm just looking to improve each week.\" By the numbers: Panthers vs Eagles \nBradford will have his hands full against a Panthers defense that has picked off eight passes in five games. Panthers corner Josh Norman is tied for the league lead in interceptions and has taken two back for touchdowns. If Philadelphia struggles to move the ball on the ground, Bradford's ability to win a game on his own will be put to the test. \n\"It's just a matter of piling the reps up and giving him more situations where he can just get a better understanding of what we're trying to do,\" Kelly said, defending his quarterback's play this season.
