Technically the home team, the Gamecocks came onto the field to the customary sounds of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Sandstorm was blaring from the speakers of Tiger Stadium just before the opening kickoff, as is done before every South Carolina home game. \nBut once the game started, none of that stopped Leonard Fournette from doing what he’s done all year and Derrius Guice from doing his best Fournette impression. The two combined for 319 rushing yards on 36 carries and two touchdowns. The Tigers rushed for 396 yards as a team. \n“They were way better than us,” said South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier. “That’s all you can say.” \nThe Gamecocks (2-4, 0-4 SEC) started second string quarterback Perry Orth, who led the offense down the field on an impressive opening drive, but had to settle for a field goal. That was the last time they led, and the only points the offense would provide in the opening half. \nThe loss drops the Gamecocks to 0-4 in the SEC, marking the worst start to begin conference play in Spurrier’s 23 years as a head coach in the conference. \n“Well we almost won one or two of them,” Spurrier said. “We didn’t almost win this one, so that’s just the way it is. We’re struggling a bunch and maybe the other teams are just a little bit better than us right now.” \nThat was certainly the case Saturday afternoon. The Gamecocks got a spark on a 96-yard kickoff return by freshman Rashad Fenton on the first touch of his college career, but it was mostly missed tackles by their defense and sloppy execution offensively. \n“Our chance to beat them was to hope they didn’t play very well,” Spurrier said. “Hoped we could get some turnovers, but I’ll be danged every time they fumbled it one of their guys was right there.” \nOrth praised the LSU community for welcoming their football program and going out of their way to make them feel at home. However, he admitted that didn’t stop a smaller-than-usual crowd of 42,058 from making it feel like a road game in the SEC. \n“This area understands kind of what we’re going through right now with Katrina,” Orth said. “It was nice to see the fans cheering us on, because they understand the circumstances back home. Those guys over there on the other team were awesome about it. There were saying keep your head up about the situation back home, so hats off to those guys and Coach Miles.” \nNobody on the South Carolina roster was directly affected by the flooding in the state, according to Spurrier. They return home this week and hope to host Vanderbilt on Saturday before an off week. Then it’s back to the road for two more conference tests at Texas A&M and Tennessee. \nTwitter: @Connelly_Times Read or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/sports/college/lsu/2015/10/10/lsus-hospitality-help-gamecocks/73754584/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:29:43.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
