Heyboer and Shayna Bohus give the Owls a formidable one-two punch. PARK RIDGE — Standing on the sideline in a cold and steady rain, Park Ridge’s Dave Schneider playfully posed the question to Waldwick’s Tommy Schultz moments before first kick.\n“So,” Schneider said in an exchange between two friendly North Jersey girls soccer coaches, “do you plan on marking No. 24? Is that part of the game plan today?”\nThe rhetorical inquiry prompted a laugh from Schultz, who rattled off all the times No. 24 — Park Ridge’s dynamic Mikaela Heyboer — had beaten him over the years.\n“She’s a [machine],” Schultz said to Schneider. “She always plays well against us.”\nThe star senior forward was at her best again Friday against the Warriors, striking for a season-high four goals in the Owls’ 6-0 win.\nBut Waldwick is far from the only team Heyboer — now with 87 career goals, including 13 this year — has victimized since joining Park Ridge in 2012.\n“Last year when we played Pompton Lakes in the sectional semifinals, their coach said to me, ‘You won that game because you had the best player on the field,’ ” Schenider said. “That was a very nice compliment.”\nThe powerful, athletic and fearless 5-foot-8 left wing has formed a dangerous tandem on Park Ridge’s front line with right wing Shayna Bohus. The senior playmakers have led the Owls to a 7-0-1 start. A threat to score on any Bohus corner kick or cross into the box — Bohus’ specialties — Heyboer has watched and studied the play of United States soccer star Abby Wambach, known for her aggressive play with her head when the ball is airborne.\n“My mom would always be printing out articles when I was younger of how [Wambach] practices and judges the flight,” Heyboer said. “She was definitely an inspiration. I’d watch videos of her, I’d practice it myself and freshman year I started getting good at it.”\nNot all of Heyboer’s goals have come via headers, though Schneider estimated she’s had probably a dozen of them in high school. Known more around North Jersey for her rocket left-footed shot, the Savannah Arts Academy-bound talent has provided plenty of other highlight-reel goals.\n“Sometimes she shoots at these bizarre angles that no one ever shoots from,” said Bohus, who has collected a team-best 10 assists this season, 40 in her career (along with 46 goals) and has developed an indisputable chemistry with Heyboer after playing with her since both were 7. “She’ll take the shot, she’ll rip it and somehow it will go in. I don’t know how she does it.”\nSchneider knew what he was getting in Heyboer, who primarily kicks lefty, but does everything else right-handed, and Bohus well before they even entered high school.\n“I’d go to the local rec games or club games whenever I had a free Saturday,” Schneider said. “Mikaela came here with a bit of a storied reputation. She was one of the girls that everyone talked about. It was always like, ‘Wait until you get Mikaela. Wait until you get this kid.’\n“And Shayna, she’s got the speed, she plays with an edge and she’s so competitive. She doesn’t get quite the same recognition, but if you check the box scores from the last three years, her name is in almost every one.”\nOnce the wait for the talented duo was over, Heyboer and Bohus have undoubtedly lived up to the hype. Starters since their freshmen years, both have been mainstays for a program that has won three league championships and reached the last two sectional finals.\nThis year, Bohus said, a sectional title is “going to happen.”\n“With them,” Schneider said, “this team is very hard to beat.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:26.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
