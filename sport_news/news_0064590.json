Comment Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 12:01 AM Micah McVicker Follow @@McVickerARD Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 12:01 AM VELMA — With her strong final push, Marietta senior Abbie Winchester won the Class 3A girls meet, a time of 12:32.62 to her credit. Four of her teammates earned Top 10 finishes, as the Lady Indians authored a convincing team win Saturday afternoon at Wildhorse Golf Course. Jaime Alexander (13:00.34), Landry Willis (13:04.12) and Gracie Cain (13:07.44) placed fifth, sixth and seventh, respectively, and Cynthia De La Torre rounded out the Top 10. With her individual victory and the Lady Indians’ team triumph, Winchester fulfilled two of her goals. “It was pretty special (to win),” she said. “It helps my team to see that their teammate’s up there, so that pushes them to do better, too. That was the most important thing for me.” The Lady Indians got a boost this year from Willis, a senior who did not run last year. Marietta coach Matt Appelman spoke highly of Willis’ participation, as the senior balanced cross country and softball. \"Landry has been a huge addition to our team,\" Appelman said. \"She has been a key member of our track team in the past, on our relays, so I knew she had the talent.\" Added Winchester, “She’s brought a lot: She’s really talented, and she also works really hard, and makes the other girls work hard, too. She’s just been really big for us this year, running like she can.” Marietta, the No. 1 team in Class 3A and two-time defending state champions, won with 29 points. Winchester acknowledged the target’s presence, and said she and her teammates strive to expel it. “We try put that out of our minds and just run the best we can,” Winchester said. “If we do that, then nothing else matters. As long as you run the best you can, then we don’t have to worry about it.” To look solely at one result will not tell the whole story, Appelman said “It’s a good course. It appears flat and curvy, but the footing’s not great, so times are generally faster at the state meet,” Appelman said. “I don’t think you can look at times and judge based off of how you ran. You have to kind of look how you placed and the effort given during the race. “I’m really happy. Both teams ran great today. I think we ran about as good as we can for today’s regional.” Boys The boys team won its first regional title, as senior Ethan Vinson finished second overall. Tishomingo’s Cameron Corbin (16:50.38) won, as he qualified for the state meet as an individual. Page 2 of 2 - \"It's a big accomplishment for our program,\" Appelman said. \"It was a big goal for us this year to win our first ever regional championship. The boys have been working extremely hard, and it paid off today.\" Marietta runners claimed the five spots behind Corbin: Bolton Fortune (17:28.53) came in third overall. Chase Waterhouse (17:34.31), Zane Nutter (17:35.46) and Jayson Friar (17:36.87) placed fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. “We’re feeling great,” Vinson said. “We’ve been working hard all season, putting in the miles and doing what we need to do.” Jesus Fernandez (18:01.69) and freshman Trace Stewart (18:15.97) also earned medals with their eighth and 10th overall finishes, respectively. “We’ve got some upperclassmen who are being leaders like they should,” Vinson said. “Jesus Fernandez has been doing this longer than any of us. “I’m really proud of my boys.” Appelman is pleased with his teams’ performance. “Any time you can put five girls in the Top 10, and seven boys in the Top 10, it’s hard to ask them to do much better,” Appelman said. “I think we’ll run faster next week. Our training is going exactly how we want it to go, so I’m excited about next week. “This (regional title) is a steppingstone for our main goal of winning a state championship.” Micah McVicker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:21:45.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
