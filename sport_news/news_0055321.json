Right now, there are brilliant blasts of red, orange and yellow foliage.\nThese are traditional elements of Japanese-inspired gardens seen all over the world. But this eight-acre contemplative space, in the massive Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park , has something else in common with the famous Portland garden: Its designer.\nHoichi Kurisu was the landscape director for the Japanese Garden Society in Portland from 1968 to 1972, and he supervised the construction of the Portland Japanese Garden, starting in 1963, based on garden designer Takuma Tono's vision.\nA half century later, the garden on top of Washington Park is closed until March to start a $33.5-million expansion that will change land leading to the entrance, but not the garden itself.\nArchitect Kengo Kuma of Japan has designed a Cultural Village and spaces to continue Tono's work, and longtime Portland Japanese Garden curator Sadafumi Uchiyama has designed gardens and landscaping that will surround the new buildings.\nKurisu has been busy, too.\nA few years after he built the Portland Japanese Garden, he started the landscape design/build firm Kurisu International in Portland. Clients range from discerning homeowners to demanding city officials. All want inviting garden spaces.\nDecades ago in Portland, Kurisu was charged with changing the site of the old Portland zoo into what's considered one of the most authentic Japanese gardens outside of Japan.\nRecently in Grand Rapids, he started with a marsh and wooded valley and created a viewing hill to take in the plantings, bridges and art surrounding a large pond.\nAn island in the pond supports a Shia hexagonal gazebo. Levitating just above the water is American artist George Rickey's revolving metal sculpture, \"Four Open Squares Horizontal Gyratory-Tapered.\"\nAround the garden, water spills over slick stones in four waterfalls and a series of scenic bridges link not only sections of the garden but visitors to the land. Visitors hold on to wood railings as they wind through Zig-zag Bridge on the way to the teahouse or bonsai garden.\nAs in Portland, plantings were chosen to bring scenes of splendor in all seasons.\nKurisu designed the Grand Rapids garden with traditional Japanese principles in mind, but just like the paths there that are never straight lines, he wavers from a purists' point of view to incorporate contemporary sculpture.\nSince the mission of the 158-acre Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park is to set scenes using botanical elements and art, this Japanese garden has seven important pieces of contemporary sculpture on display, including works by India-born Anish Kapoor, Chinese artist Zhang Huan, Japanese sculptor Masayuki Koorida and Italian artist Giuseppe Penone.\n\"We are facing a new era,\" Kurisu says. \"In our fast paced world, we need to have surprises and to be able to enjoy scenery but also have an awakening, enlightenment.\"\nIn his decades of designing, he says each environment is distinctive, drawing on the climate and culture of every place. \"You want to make it unique,\" he says.\n-- Janet Eastman\njeastman@oregonian.com\n503-799-8739\n@janeteastman\nLike the Portland Japanese Garden, the Richard & Helen DeVos Japanese Garden is a member of the Portland-based North American Japanese Garden Association and is part of our Japanese garden road trip series .\nShow us your photos\nAlthough the Portland Japanese Garden, considered one of the most authentic outside of Japan, is closed, it's not forgotten.
