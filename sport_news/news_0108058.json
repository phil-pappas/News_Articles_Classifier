Rutherford takes on seventh-seeded Pascack Hills on Saturday at Northern Valley Old Tappan High School. \nBut the county tournament was not kind to both 16th-seeded Becton and 25th-seeded Lyndhurst. The Lady Wildcats dropped a 25-21, 25-20 verdict to 17th-seeded Northern Highlands on Saturday in East Rutherford. And the Lady Golden Bears fell 25-15, 25-13 to eighth-seeded Mahwah, also on Saturday. The loss dropped Lyndhurst to 14-6 on the season. \nWhat a difference a year makes. \nLast season, it was Becton defeating Rutherford in the first round, 25-17, 25-13, at Becton. \nAnd this season the Lady Bulldogs are moving on to the Bergen County Tournament quarterfinals. \nRutherford senior Jessica Rogers is making the most of her last run in the county tournament. Rogers led the way against Hackensack with 18 kills, three digs and an assist. Senior Theresa Mignone added eight digs while sophomore Anna DeCesare chipped in 18 assists. \nThe contest against Pascack Hills will be a battle of former NJIC Colonial Division rivals. With the win over Hackensack, Rutherford raised its record to 14-4. \nBecton was in the same position as last year as the 16th seed, but could not get past a quality Northern Highlands team. Ironically both teams had faced Ridgewood recently with Becton losing in three games while Highlands won in three games. \nIn the Bergen County match, the two games mirrored each other. \nNorthern Highlands would get an early lead and Becton would come back with strong serving to only fall both times. \nThe two Sams led the way for the Wildcats. Sam Stallone had seven kills to lead the Becton offense while Sam Frola chipped in three digs. Justina Cabezas helped set up the Becton offense with eight assists. \nFor Becton head coach Mike Settembrino it was unforced errors that did in Becton and its 'passing' game. \n\"Our passing game was below average and that hurt our offense,\" said Settembrino whose team now looks to win back-to-back NJIC Meadowlands Division titles and the state tournament. \"We need to play more consistently as a whole.\" \nThe Wildcats host Wallington on Thursday in the Battle of Paterson Avenue at Becton. The Lady Wildcats (16-3) will look to avenge their lone NJIC Meadowlands Division loss in two years that came to Wallington earlier this season. \nFor Lyndhurst, one of its goals was to make the county tournament and it did just that. \nShayna Southard led the way against Mahwah with nine digs while Haley Duffy had three kills. Three other Lady Bears registered two kills each, Kira Adams, Cameron Halpern and Lindsay Henning. Eva Pelidis chipped in nine assists. \n\"Making the Bergen County Tournament was one of our goals and we accomplished that,\" said Lyndhurst head coach Steve Vahalla. \"These girls are working hard each and every day to make sure Lyndhurst Volleyball is being noticed. We'll continue to work hard this season and fight for every point.\" \nVahalla added that the contest against Mahwah will help them in the upcoming Group 1 state tournament.
