Comment Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 10:47 PM By Observer-Dispatch Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 10:47 PM One goal. That’s all the Utica Comets have scored in their first two games this season. And it has translated into an 0-2 record. The Comets were blanked Saturday, losing 3-0 on the road to the Hartford Wolfpack. The loss came a week after the Comets fell 2-1 to the Rochester Americans in their season-opener. Utica fell behind 1-0 in the first period, and a pair of scores in the third sealed the win for the Wolfpack. The Comets are back on the ice Wednesday, when they host the Amerks to open their 2015-16 home schedule. They also will be at home Friday and Saturday. The Hershey Bears will be at the Aud on Friday, and the Syracuse Crunch will visit Saturday. First period Each team had their chances on goal. The Comets even had a couple power plays. But the Wolfpack were the only ones to actually put the puck in the net. Richard Nejezchleb’s rebound goal put Hartford on top 8:20 into the period. Hartford was whistled for two penalties in the period (one on either side of the goal), but the Wolfpack killed off both Comets power plays. The Wolfpack out-shot the Comets 14-11 in the period. Second period The teams were a little more active in the middle period, though that didn’t exactly show up on the score sheet. There were five penalties in the period, and the officials needed to separate the players a couple times. A few of the penalties overlapped, and both sides’ special teams were able to fend off the power plays. The Comets out-shot the Wolfpack almost 2-to-1 in the second, but Hartford goalie Magnus Hellberg wasn’t letting anything past him. Third period Adam Tambellini extended the lead to 2-0 early in the final period, and Hellberg remained a force in goal for the Wolfpack, keeping the Comets off the scoreboard. Utica yanked goalie Joe Cannata late in the period, and Chad Nehring took advantage, potting the empty-netter for the 3-0 final. Cannata made 25 saves in goal; Hellberg finished with 30.
