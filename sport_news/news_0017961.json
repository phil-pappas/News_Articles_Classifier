Blackcats fall flat against Bellville Brandon Cox The Bay City Tribune | 0 comments \nBAY CITY – The Blackcats returned home to Memorial Stadium on Friday night after two weeks on the road. Bay City was looking for a momentum-shifting win in hopes of carrying a winning record through the bye week ahead of district play. The Bellville Brahmas had different plans, and came in to Bay City with intentions of steamrolling the Blackcats. The Brahmas defeated Bay City 42-7 on Friday night. \nA lengthy pre-game ceremony preceded the contest. The Bay City Lil’ Cats and attendees of the Blackcat Mini Cheer Camp were highlighted before the BCHS’s Bella Voce performed the Star Spangled Banner. A moment of silence was observed in honor of former Tribune sports editor Barry Halvorson who passed away earlier this week. \nBellville won the coin toss and deferred to the second half. \nAfter the kickoff the game began with a missed cue on offense for the Blackcats. In their first play from scrimmage quarterback Darryl Florez was looking to the sideline for a play call and the center snapped the ball early. Florez was able to run and pick it up, but threw it away after pursuit by the Brahmas. He was flagged for intentional grounding, putting Bay City in an early hole. \nBellville struck first on an 11-yard carry by Jacob Higginbotham to cap off a 12 play, 81-yard drive. After the PAT kick by Easton Higgins the Brahmas led Bay City 7-0 with 0:38 left in the first quarter. \nThe visiting team attacked again, finding the end zone early in the second quarter on a one play drive, a 63-yard rush by Mac Brisco to go up 14-0 over the Blackcats with 9:11 left in the first half. \nThe Blackcats produced next, marching down the field on a 7 play, 70-yard drive that ended in an 8-yard pass from Florez to Matagorda County’s leading receiver Prinard Payne. Payne’s catch and the ensuing PAT cut the Brahma lead to 14-7 with 6:47 to play in the second. \nThe Brahmas added to their lead once more before heading in to the locker room at halftime on a one-yard dash by Briscoe. The short scamper crowned a 16 play, 56-yard drive to put Bellville up 21-7 going in to the break. \nIn the third quarter Bellville continued their commitment to the run. With 9:05 left in the third Briscoe again found the end zone with his feet after breaking for a 39-yard gain. The Brahmas led Bay City 28-7 after the Higgins point after kick. \nBellville’s defense came up big with 6:54 left in the third frame. Brahma defensive back Kylan McDade picked off a Blackcat pass and returned the ball 52 yards for a touchdown. Higgins’ boot added the point after and increased Bellville’s lead to 35-7. \nBellville attempted only three passes on the night, one being intercepted but another counted for the final score of the contest. With 2:55 to play in the fourth quarter Brahma quarterback Marcus Ward found Tanner Riden behind the Bay City secondary for a 36-yard touchdown toss. The score put Bellville up 42-7, as they would remain until the clock’s final tick. \n“We had a great week in practice,” said Bay City head coach Lupe Florez. “When the pressure is on they’re still having to think too much. We’re not in panic mode. We’re not going back to the drawing board. We just need to simplify some things.” \nCoach Florez compared the situation to his experience a year ago on the sidelines for Cameron Yoe, the eventual Class 3A State Champion. \n“This is very similar to how we started last year at Yoe. Last year Cameron was 2-3 after the Rockdale game. We went back and simplified things,” he said. \nThe Yoemen went unbeaten from that point and found themselves at AT&T Stadium in Arlington celebrating a state championship. \n“We have got to be able to run the ball,” said Florez. “Right now teams are playing six in the box against us and dropping everyone else in to coverage.” \nThe coach isn’t concerned with the players’ attitudes or buy-in. He believes the team only needs some fine-tuning over the bye week in order to be ready for district play. \n“These kids have improved tremendously,” he said. “It’s a big project. It just takes time. The kids have bought in. Tonight after the game one of the coaches wrote ‘Blackcat Fight Never Dies’ in a whiteboard in the locker room. Every player signed it.” \n“We’ve got two of the best, biggest and fastest defensive linemen in South Texas, but we have to get better at the little things. The offensive line has some work to do, and we have to work on tackling. We just have to simplify things.” \nThe Blackcats are off this coming Friday night. They will use the week to work on fundamentals and to get healthy. Defensive end Spencer MacLennan is expected to be ready for district play after missing two weeks with a high-ankle sprain suffered in practice ahead of the St. Pius X game. Defensive back and running back Lawrence Smith is nursing two broken toes and hopes to be ready to go before the Blackcats travel to Stafford after the bye to begin district play on Oct. 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:01:08.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
