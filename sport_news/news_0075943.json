TCU won 45-21. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) \nTrevone Boykin is separating himself from the nation’s other prolific quarterbacks. He’s the only one to go over 500 yards in total offense three times. No other QB has done it more than once. \nThe TCU quarterback’s latest 500-yard game came in Saturday’s 45-21 win over Iowa State. \nHe now owns three of the top nine single-game totals this season. His 527 yards against Texas Tech ranks No. 5, his 510 against Iowa State is No. 7 and his 504 against SMU is No. 9. \nBoykin’s average of 425.6 yards ranks second to Bowling Green QB Matt Johnson’s 428.3. \nThe senior from Dallas has recorded seven of the top 10 total-offense games in TCU history. \n___ \nSome other notable statistics: \nSTANFORD STAR: Christian McCaffrey’s 369 all-purpose yards against UCLA last Thursday are most in the nation this season. He rushed for a school-record 243 yards, caught a pass for 4 yards and had 122 kick return yards, with 96 coming on a first-quarter return that ended with him brought down at the UCLA 4. The son of former NFL receiver Ed McCaffrey leads the FBS with 253 all-purpose yards per game. \nBALL-HAWKING AGGIES: Utah State had eight takeaways in its 52-26 win over then-No. 21 Boise State and rose to fourth nationally in turnover margin at plus-1.5 per game. The eight takeaways were the Aggies’ most in a game since at least 1993, according to the school. Utah State has at least three takeaways in four straight games and 95 in its last 43 games. \nCOUGAR CRAZINESS: Mike Leach’s “Air Raid” offense is averaging 485.3 yards a game at Washington State, and no team has completed more passes than the Cougars. You’d think there would have been some really big plays along the way. But the Cougars remain the only team in the nation to not have a play from scrimmage of 40 yards or longer. In fact, only 13 teams have had fewer than the Cougars’ nine plays of 30 yards or longer. The quick, short-pass offense is sixth in plays of 10 yards-plus, however, with 123. \nNATIONAL LEADERS: LSU’s Leonard Fournette is the nation’s top rusher at 200.3 yards a game. Florida State’s Dalvin Cook is second at 159.2. Bowling Green’s Johnson is the national passing leader at 413 yards a game. TCU’s Josh Doctson is the leading receiver at 152.4 yards a game. \nQB RUSHING RECORD: Jason Vander Laan of Division II Ferris State set the NCAA all-division record for career rushing yards by a quarterback. The junior ran for 161 yards against Ohio Dominican to increase his total to 5,218 yards in 40 games. Wofford’s Shawn Graves (1989-92) held the previous mark of 5,128 yards. Vander Laan also has 70 career TDs rushing, two shy of the Division II record for most by a quarterback.
