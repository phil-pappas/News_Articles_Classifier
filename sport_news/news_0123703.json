Hingle-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW ORLEANS -- Déjà vu all over again: If you’re a Saints fan – or a football fan of any kind, for that matter – you remember former Saint Steve Gleason’s blocked punt for a touchdown against Atlanta on the night the Superdome reopened 13 months after Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans. The Saints even immortalized the play with a statue outside the stadium. \nPrior to the game, the Gleason was presented with the Pro Football Writers of America George Halas Award. \nThen, what seemed like a nod to Gleason, Mandeville’s own Michael Mauti, whose father Rich spent seven seasons in New Orleans, blocked a Falcons punt, recovered it and proceeded into the end zone to give the Saints a 14-7 lead. \nIn true Gleason fashion, he tweeted: “Hey, Falcons. #NeverPunt -SG.” \nIt was truly a memorable moment for everyone in attendance and the first time the Saints had blocked a punt and returned for a touchdown since the 2012 season opening loss to Washington Redskins. \nOFFENSIVE LINE BEAT UP: Already without starting left tackle Terron Armstead, the team lost backup tackle Andrus Peat on the game’s first drive, leaving the Saints in a precarious situation. \nEnter Tony Hills, a journeyman tackle who’s played in just 15 games with 10 different teams over his eight-year NFL career. \nHill was signed less than two weeks ago and looked lost for much of the night. \nThere’s no sugarcoating it, the Saints offensive line is in shambles, and in the first half Drew Brees hardly had a second to throw downfield. In the second half, however, the team cleaned things up and Brees was far more effective stretching the field. He went over the 300-yard mark with 10 minutes left in the game. \nGROUND GAME WOES: The Saints rushing attack continues to really struggle, thanks in large part to the subpar play of the offensive line. The Saints came in with the 29th-ranked rushing offense and didn’t improve on that. Meanwhile, Atlanta torched the Saints for more than 150 yards by early fourth quarter. \nThe Saints will have to clean things up going forward.
