Pain is part of the game in motocross and he accepts that. But when you’ve had as many unfortunate and severe injuries as Canard, it begins to take a toll. \nThe spells never last long, though. Canard always reminds himself that motocross riding is what he loves, what he’s good at and it’s worth it no matter how many times he gets hurt. \n“Each time, it’s certainly more difficult to come back to racing, but on the other hand it grows me in some sort of way,” Canard said heading into this weekend’s Monster Energy Cup in Las Vegas. “Hopefully, I’m done with most of the growing pains.” \nCanard’s injury list includes two broken femurs, a broken collarbone and a horrific accident in 2012 - caused by a piece of sign getting stuck in his wheel - that left him with three broken vertebrae that required two rods to be placed along his spine. \nCanard came back strong, finishing sixth in the 2013 Supercross standings and fourth in motocross. Canard suffered a broken arm while preparing for the 2014 Supercross season, but again had a strong comeback, finishing third in the 2014 motocross standings. \nThe 25-year-old rider from Elk City, Oklahoma, continued to race well at the start of the 2015 Supercross season, winning twice to rank second in the season standings through 11 races. \nBut in the 12th race, at Detroit, Canard did not see fellow rider Jake Weimer had slowed on the track until it was too late. Canard landed on top of Weimer in the scary looking crash and suffered a broken left arm, knocking him out for the rest of the Supercross season and most of motocross. \nCanard did manage to return for four races at the end of the motocross season and is fully healthy heading into Saturday’s Monster Energy Cup. \n“It’s been a few months since I’ve been riding and I feel healthy,” Canard said. “Even though I wasn’t completely ready to come back during the outdoor season, it was good to get back to racing and I’m looking forward to racing this weekend.” \nHe will be facing a deep, talented field not far from the bright lights of The Strip. \nRyan Dungey will be trying for a perfect season after sweeping the Supercross and motocross titles this season. Chad Reed, who’s won three combined Supercross and motocross championships, also is in the field and so is 2014 motocross champion Ken Roczen, along with defending Monster Energy Cup champion Davi Millsaps. \nThe race also will be the second for James Stewart following his 16-month drug suspension for a prescription drug that was not cleared ahead of time. The three-time series champion made a splash in his return last week, repeating as Straight Rhythm champion in Pomona, California. \n“You don’t understand how good this feels,” Stewart said after beating Roczen in the finals. “I’m so stoked right now.” \nSo is Canard heading into motocross’ only $1 million race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:33:02.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
