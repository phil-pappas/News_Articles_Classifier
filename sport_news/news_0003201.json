He was 60.\nSaunders was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma in June and doctors called it \"treatable and curable.\" But he took a leave of absence from the team in September after complications arose during his treatment, which included chemotherapy. He had been hospitalized for more than a month.\n\"Flip was a symbol of strength, compassion, and dignity for our organization,\" owner Glen Taylor said in a statement. \"He was a shining example of what a true leader should be, defined by his integrity and kindness to all he encountered.\nSam Mitchell has been named interim head coach and GM Milt Newton is heading the team's personnel department.\nSaunders went 654-592 in 17 NBA seasons with the Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards . But his best days came in Minnesota, where he nurtured Kevin Garnett from a teenager who jumped straight from high school to the NBA in 1995 and helped turn the woeful Wolves into a perennial playoff team.\nThe Timberwolves had started to practice on Sunday when Newton got word from Taylor of Saunders' death. Practice was halted and Garnett left the floor, walked to the parking garage at the practice facility and sat down in the spot marked for Saunders.

He played in college at Minnesota, teaming with Kevin McHale and Mychal Thompson as a senior to lead the Golden Gophers to a 24-3 record.\nCavaliers: LeBron James went through a full practice for the first time since he received an anti-inflammatory injection in his back. James had been limited to shooting drills and conditioning since getting the shot Oct. 13. But he took part in every aspect of Cleveland's workout Sunday, increasing his chances of playing in the season opener Tuesday in Chicago. The 30-year-old received a similar shot in his back early last season, when he was slowed by back pain and a strained left knee. He played in two of Cleveland's seven exhibition games this preseason. The Cavs would like to limit his regular-season minutes to keep James fresh for the playoffs.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850766/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850764/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850763/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850765/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850764/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850766/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850765/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850767/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850767/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/65/8850763/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:32:15.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
