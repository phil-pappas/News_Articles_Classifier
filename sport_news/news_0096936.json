A combined effort from the pharmaceutical industry and clinicians is needed to design clinical trials to test the possibility that AD is caused by fungal infection.\"\nOutside experts agreed that further study must be done to confirm or disprove the fungus theory.\nAs they stand, the findings are \"very speculative\", French neurodegenerative disease expert Sylvain Lehmann told AFP.\n\"We cannot conclude from this work that such (fungal) infections cause or increase the risk of the disease,\" added Laura Phipps of Alzheimer's Research UK.\nLast month, a study said people injected with hormones extracted from cadaver brains in a long-abandoned medical procedure may have received \"seeds\" of Alzheimer's raising the spectre of it being a transmissible disease.\n lifestyle health Alzheimer fungus wellbeing Also Read Worried about beer bellies and receding hairline?
