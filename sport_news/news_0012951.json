Centennial High Clackamas High Gresham High Lincoln High* Oregon City High Southridge High Stoller Middle Sunset High Tualatin High West Linn High * More than 20 percent of students skipped the tests, so results may not be accurate Source: Analysis by The Oregonian/OregonLive of Oregon Department of Education data Yes, most schools in Lake Oswego , West Linn and Southwest Portland helped their students make extra-large strides. But that level of success was also accomplished at Putnam High in Milwaukie, Centennial High in outer Southeast Portland and a collection of high-poverty elementary schools in Beaverton and Tigard-Tualatin, including Aloha-Huber Park , Kinnaman, Bridgeport and Tualatin.\nThe report cards give a more sophisticated, more meaningful look at school performance than test scores alone because they compare each school to schools with the most similar student populations. More importantly, the report cards reveal how much each school helped its students grow academically, given where the students started a year or years earlier.\nUpdate and warning: State officials cautioned at 2 p.m. Thursday that they miscalculated the comparison schools performance for an unknown number of schools. The state plans to issued corrected figures this afternoon. The Oregonian/OregonLive will give details as they become available.\nSchools where students made anemic growth included nearly every school in the struggling, high-poverty Reynolds and Parkrose districts on Portland's east side. But juniors at low- and moderate-poverty schools such as Portland's Cleveland High , Bend High and Beaverton High also showed measly reading and math gains since middle school, the state reported.\nHow Tigard-Tualatin achieved success Reporter Laura Frazier gives an in-depth explanation of how Tigard elementary schools helped students make large strides in reading and math The report cards are based almost entirely on how students scored on Smarter Balanced tests , given for the first time in Oregon and 16 other states last spring.\nThe exams, designed to measure how well schools help students master the Common Core standards in reading, writing, math and analysis , represented a huge step up in expectations from Oregon's previous reading and math tests.\nBecause the new tests were so different, the Legislature ordered the Oregon Department of Education to give schools and teachers a one-year reprieve from having their performance rated based on the first year's scores.\nPoor Results These 10 big metro schools showed small test score gains for individual students. Aloha High Beaverton High Canby High Cleveland High* Corbett School Forest Grove High Lake Oswego High* Grant High* Reynolds High Wilson High* * More than 20 percent of students skipped the tests, so results may not be accurate Source: Analysis by The Oregonian/OregonLive of Oregon Department of Education data Thursday's report cards display the phrase \"not rated\" in place of the customary overall rating on a scale of 1 to 5. Out of an abundance of caution, the department also did not rate any subcomponents of overall performance, such as graduation rates or minority student achievement levels.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive came up with an easy way to compare key overall performance metrics for each school.\nColor-coded, searchable online charts show at a glance how a school's proficiency rates in English or math stacks up against that at similar schools. The online displays also show how each school's typical student growth in reading and math scores compares to growth for students in the rest of the state.\nThe information is not as robust as the state's usual ratings, but it offers parents, educators and the public important information about schools' success at getting students to reach Common Core standards in 2014-15.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive was able to provide ratings-like information from the states' ratings-free report cards because the state included important information about how schools' performances stacked up.\nThat key data included how much growth individual students showed from their previous years' test performance. The state also reported how each school's proficiency rates compare to those at schools with similar levels of low-income students, student mobility and students who learned English as a second language.\nBoth those methods, refined by the state over the years, allow a more meaningful look at a school's test scores than passing rates alone. They also allow schools to be compared on a more level playing field.\nExamining those statistics allowed The Oregonian/OregonLive to draw conclusions about which schools did a superior job, which lagged, and which showed mixed or average outcomes in the first year of Smarter Balanced testing.\nSchools in the Beaverton, Tigard-Tualatin, Hillsboro, North Clackamas and West Linn-Wilsonville districts all showed strong performances.\nIn Beaverton, Oregon's third-largest district, Aloha High and Beaverton High posted English and math gains that ranked in the bottom 10 percent statewide. But they were the exception. More than 70 percent of Beaverton's schools showed above-average student growth. Among them were schools with extremely high rates of poverty and high rates of students for whom English is a second language, including Vose and Kinnaman elementaries and Aloha-Huber School.\nBeaverton's communication director, Maureen Wheeler, said that, beginning in fall 2013, the district used proceeds from a voter-approved levy in part to direct extra money to schools with the toughest educational challenges. Schools were free to deploy the money as they saw best but were held accountable for results, she said. Summer school classes and extra teachers to lead small-group interventions for students paid off, she said.\nHillsboro also showed widespread strong performance, especially in English. More than 55 percent of its schools achieved above-average growth for their typical student.\nThat included at W.L. Henry Elementary, a formerly struggling school where three-fourths of the students learned English as their second language. Free Orchards and Verne McKinney elementaries, with overwhelming poverty, showed exceptional results.\nIn Portland Public Schools, by contrast, schools showed uneven performances. Many schools with few minority and low-income students helped their students make huge gains and outshined schools with similar student bodies. Those include Beverly Cleary Schoo l, West Sylvan Middle School, Laurelhurst School and Ainsworth Elementary, all schools where fewer than 15 percent of students are low-income.\nBut many Portland schools with large low-income or second-language populations produced anemic growth or significantly lagged other Oregon schools with similar populations. Those Portland underperformers included Roosevelt High , Lent and Boise-Eliot/Humboldt K-8s and Kelly, Woodlawn, Faubion and Arleta elementaries.\nJoe Suggs, Portland's director of research, evaluation and assessment, said scores for most Portland high schools are unreliable because so many high-performing students boycotted the tests.\nHe said comparison's of the typical student's growth from school to school should be interpreted with caution, given the difference between Oregon's old all-multiple-choice tests and the much higher cognitive demands of the new tests.\nSarah Singer, Portland's senior director of system planning and performance , said the district nonetheless believes analyzing students' year-to-year growth to monitor school performance is important.\nShe and Suggs both said they see signs in the performance data that some Portland schools need to do better.\n\"We are concerned about schools that are not performing the way they should for our kids,\" Singer said.\n- Betsy Hammond\nbetsyhammond@oregonian.com\n@chalkup", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sarah-singer/0/15b/419"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:24:08.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
