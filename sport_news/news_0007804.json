Ma and Jarrett fell in the consolation quarterfinals to teammates Han and Dane Faris, who lost in the next round. \nBellingham also earned plenty of recognition on the first team with Austin Shenton, Henry Ziels and Zach Nolan all earning spots. Shenton finished third in singles at districts while Ziels and Nolan took fourth. Red Raiders’ Jonny Larson and Ignacio Gonzalez both received second-team bids. \nSqualicum’s dynamic duo of Colin Weller, who burst onto the scene as a freshman, and Kevin Smiley were the Storm’s only first-team selections. The duo took third place at districts. \nRounding out the first team was Ferndale’s Tate Freeman, Sedro-Woolley’s Beuse and Burlington-Edison’s Colton Saben. \nThe second team included Anacortes’ Cooper Huntley, Ryan Campbell and Derek Vance, Lynden’s Tore Olson and Carson Smith, Ferndale’s Tommy Lyons and Burlington-Edison’s Connor Atkinson. \nAll-Northwest Conference Boys’ Tennis \nMVP: Max Shmotolohka (Sehome); First team: Austin Shenton (Bellingham), Colin Weller (Squalicum), Reece Gilbert (Sehome), Henry Ziels (Bellingham), Shane Lynette (Sehome), Kyle Beuse (Sedro-Woolley), Kevin Smiley (Squalicum), Colton Saben (Burlington-Edison), Tate Freeman (Ferndale), William Zhang (Sehome), Zach Nolan (Bellingham); Second team: Cooper Huntley (Anacortes), Darren Ma (Sehome), Tore Olson (Lynden), Matthieu Jarrett (Sehome), Tommy Lyons (Ferndale), Derek Vance (Anacortes), Henry Han (Sehome), Ryan Campbell (Anacortes), Ignacio Gonzalez (Bellingham), Carson Smith (Lynden), Jonny Larson (Bellingham), Connor Atkinson (Burlington-Edison).
