Barrett \nOhio State quarterback J.T. Barrett plays against Penn State. \nOhio State quarterback J.T. Barrett plays against Penn State. (Jay LaPrete / AP) Shannon Ryan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Is Michigan State worried about Indiana? You bet. \nIn the never-ending Ohio State quarterback story line, the Buckeyes will have a new field general when they play at Rutgers on Saturday. \nJ.T. Barrett has \"earned the right\" to start over Cardale Jones, coach Urban Meyer said on Tuesday's Big Ten coaches teleconference. Meyer pointed to Barrett's better efficiency in the red zone and on third downs as a reason for the switch. \n\"Sheer production,\" he said. \"Cardale is going to be a very active part. Hopefully we'll keep him very much involved. It was a real difficult decision.\" \nSome would say the decision was overdue. \nBarrett owns an 83.3 red zone completion percentage, which is more than 50 percentage points better than that of Jones, according to ESPN. On the 12 possessions he directed the last two weeks, Barrett has led the Buckeyes to 11 touchdowns. \nBarrett also rushed for 102 yards on 11 carries in last week's victory against Penn State. Jones, who has started all seven games this season, connected on 9 of 15 passes for 84 yards before being benched in the second half against the Nittany Lions. \n\"There is disappointment (from Jones),\" Meyer said of the switch. \"They're grown men.\" \nMeyer said Jones' role mostly will be providing support from the sideline. Barrett was the starter last season before breaking his ankle. \nMichigan State moving on: The last 10 seconds of the Michigan-Michigan State game will live forever. \nSpartans coach Mark Dantonio is tasked with trying to get the team to move on from a game that had one of the wildest finishes in college football after Michigan punter Blake O'Neill fumbled a snap and the Spartans ran it back for a game-winning touchdown. \nPlaying Indiana on Saturday doesn't generate the same buzz, but Dantonio warns the Hoosiers are a dangerous opponent and the Spartans have bigger goals ahead. \n\"We track how we play after big games whether we win or lose them,\" he said. \"Our record is very good in how we've been able to handle that. We have to be able to handle success. Our dreams are important. Our dreams are right in front of us. Our goal is to win the East (Division). To do that, you have to win each and every football game. This is just another step in the process.\" \nAs for the vicious tweets sent to O'Neill, Dantonio said that fans shouldn't lose perspective. \n\"It's very disappointing,\" he said. \"That's the world we're living in right now. People tend to attack people via social media. It's one play. It's too bad. It's just one play and it should not define a person based on his football ability or anything else. There's a lot of interest in these games but you (should not) take it to an extreme. This is still a game.\" \nRookie receivers: Illinois has had to cope with injuries on offense since the start of the season. \nFor Illinois interim coach Bill Cubit that meant scrapping some redshirts that he had hoped some players could use. \nFreshmen receivers Desmond Cain and Sam Mays have been given larger roles than expected with the absence of Mikey Dudek (knee) and Justin Hardee (foot) and now Marchie Murdock (thigh). They also will be without running back Josh Ferguson (shoulder), whose fifth in team receiving, Saturday when Wisconsin visits. \nCain ranks second on the Illini with 22 catches for 176 yards. In the last three games, he has caught 14 passes for 123 yards. \nMays has had \"ups and downs,\" Cubit said, with seven catches for 78 yards and a touchdown against Kent State in the opener. \n\"You hope you can redshirt them, but we can't afford that,\" Cubit said. \"I give Des a lot of credit. I like both of them. They're progressing. Des is getting better each week.\" \nCubit also praised the improvement of sophomore Malik Turner, who has seven catches for 103 yards in the last two games. \n\"We have to keep him going,\" Cubit said. \nExtra points: Asked about nasty sports fans on Twitter, Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said he has contemplated created a David Letterman- like top-10 list of Twitter \"trolls.\" He said he doesn't have time to see it through. \"What do the kids call them? Haters?\" he asked. \"I feel sorry for those people.\"… Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh's name has recently been linked to NFL openings. Sports Illustrated's Peter King said the Colts have reached out to Harbaugh. Harbaugh didn't engage that question. \"I won't comment on it,\" he said. \"It's disrespectful to the game.\"… Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi made a comment that some construed as a shot at the Nittany Lions about a \"talented quarterback with a bad play caller.\" Penn State coach James Franklin didn't bite, saying, \"I don't want to read into anything. There have been comments and things I've said in the past that people have read into, so I'm not going to read into anything. Happy for them and the success that they've had, but my focus is on Penn State completely, 100 percent.\"… Purdue running back D.J. Knox could miss up to two weeks with an ankle sprain. The Boilermakers have an off week before facing Nebraska on Oct. 31. Coach Darrell Hazell said despite offensive woes he plans on sticking with redshirt freshman quarterback David Blough. … Rutgers receiver Leonte Carroo did not practice Tuesday with an ankle injury and is questionable for Saturday's game against Ohio State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:13:16.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
