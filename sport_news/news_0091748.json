They were confident about it. In fact, as soon as they took the field Thursday, all of their travel bags were lined up outside the clubhouse — as captured by Sun photographer Dave Abel — and ready for the charter flight south.\nAnd they delivered with a stunning 7-1 win.\n“I will never forget when George Brett came in here and beat us right in our own turf winning the series MVP along the way,” said legendary Canadian actor Sean McCann, who is a Blue Jays season ticket holder and amateur scout. “I said after we lost 14-2 in Game 4 here that ‘Now we are going to do to them in 2015 what they did to us back in 1985.’”\nThe team has certainly got the opportunity to make it happen.\nAnd the team to do it, too.\n“I have always said they would win this in seven games,” said Bill Provenzano, who with his daughter, Elizabeth Mateus, has — like fans across the country — been enjoying the ride of 2015 immensely.\nThe “Tenth Player Flock” was once again an incredible force to help the Jays get back in this series.\nLoud, boisterous and engaged. The players on the field love these fans.\nAnd the fans love them back.\n“They are a determined group and I really believe this is a team they will be talking about 30 years from now,” said Derek (Sarge) Soberal.\nIf they are going to be, they have two more games to win to get them a shot at the World Series.\nBut they have to win the first one first.\nThe team’s ace David Price will get the ball Friday night for Game 6, at Kaufmann Stadium, and if all goes well, they will go to phenom Marcus Stroman.\n“The Royals are a great team, no question but I still like our chances,” said McCann, who has been in some sports movies with great comeback plot lines like Miracle and The Air Up There. “Our guys will certainly give it our best shot.”\nAlready the comeback kids, if the Jays do it in Kansas City, it could end up being the stuff of movies. They did, after all, beat the Texas Rangers in the first series after losing the first two games at home and having to win three in a row.\nThey are tasked with that challenge again. The faithful at the Rogers Centre certainly believe they can do it again.\n“This is our year, our time,” said Jhamil Zelaya. “The Blue Jays are a team of destiny and they can’t lose.”\nThe Jays have to play with emotion as the team does well when the players do, said Matt Sannelli.\n“This team needed to adjust in this series and now that they have, they are in good shape,” he added.\nHis pal, David G. Elliot agreed, saying there have been some “great baseball games” this fall already and he believes there “are more to come.”\nWe know there is at least one more and that will be on Friday night.\nTo pay homage to the late great Yoga Berra “it ain’t over till it’s over.”\nThe Kansas City Royals taught that lesson to the Blue Jays in 1985. In 2015, we’ll find out if it ends up being a case of deja vu and Back to the Future combined.\nWARMINGTON\n'Back to the Future' for the Jays\nBy Joe Warmington Wednesday, October 21, 2015 09:11 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 09:28 PM EDT\nIt’s a case of “Back to the Future” and “Deja vu all over again.”\nIt took 30 years but the Toronto Blue Jays have given themselves a chance at revenge.\nIt was 30 Octobers ago when the roles were reversed and it was the Blue Jays that were up in the American League Division Series by three games to one with two games at home to finish up the Kansas City Royals and head to the World Series.\nThe Jays’ dream ended Oct. 16, 1985, when George Brett and the Royals completed the comeback and won Games 6 and 7 at Exhibition Stadium, leaving Blue Jays fans in a puddle of despair.\nAbout the author Joe Warmington Follow Joe Warmington on Twitter Other Stories Longtime Jays season ticket holders ousted by bigwigs\nThese Toronto Blue Jays fans had the hottest ticket in town for the big series against the Kansas City Royals.\n0\nBlue support at Blue Jays game - just not for Tories\nThere was at least one part of the country that was definitely solidly and enthusiastically supporting blue.\n0\nSee more from Joe Warmington »\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Blue Jays blast Royals to force Game 6\n0\nWrong to pay for teacher negotiating costs\n0\nOwner upset OPP officer ran over 'sweet dog' twice\n0\nTCHC's $65,000 Man told to pay $25Gs or get out\n0\nTrudeau’s first move doesn’t bode well\n0\nKaren Stintz new mayor of Variety Village\n0\nBlue Jays blast Royals to force Game 6\n0\nNot taking part in ISIS war 'a big mistake'\n0\nJustin Trudeau's 2013 'Just watch me' note up for auction on eBay\n0\nTCHC's $65,000 Man told to pay $25Gs or get out\n0\nSun Reporters Ganter & Longley on Blue Jays Win\nJays fan gets bat flip tattoo\nAndrea Christidis remembered\nJays get ready for Game 5\nBob Elliott and Steve Buffery on the Blue Jays win\nMore from Toronto & GTA Punjab violence worries GTA Sikhs 0\nTCHC's $65,000 Man told to pay $25Gs or get out 0\nHaunting TTC video of Yatim shooting shown to court 0\nTory talks transit on London business mission 0\nUber warned it's breaking city bylaw 0\nInside Toronto sun.com Sports\nBlue Jays coming alive in Game 5s 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/@joe_warmington", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-22T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:35:56.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
