In the Champions League we have six points and in the league we have five, having played more games,\" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. \"We had a good game tonight, and that didn't happen at Napoli.\n\"Our attitude has always been the same ... we played better technically tonight.\"\nSevilla, which kicked off its Champions League campaign with a 3-0 win over 'Gladbach, only recorded its first win in the Spanish league last weekend.\n\"We did OK in attack and we noticed improvement in the rest, but not enough against a great side like Juventus,\" Sevilla coach Unai Emery said. \"We had hardly any goal scoring chances. The result is fair and now we have to go forward like this and things will improve as we grow as a team.\"\nLosing finalists last season, Juventus almost got off to the perfect start as it had a great chance inside the opening 30 seconds, but Paul Pogba volleyed over the crossbar from inside the area.\nSevilla was defending in numbers and every time Juventus attacked it found itself faced with a sea of red shirts. However, Patrice Evra was finding space on the left flank and he nearly set up the opener in the eighth minute.\nThe former Manchester United defender had time to stop and look up before sending in a pinpoint cross, which Morata headed just wide of the right post under pressure.\nJuventus was also trying its luck from distance and a Hernanes shot flew narrowly wide of the left upright from 30 yards.\nPaulo Dybala went even closer in the 17th minute when he curled an effort millimeters wide of the far left post from the edge of the area.\nSevilla was content to sit back and counterattack but posed little threat to the Juventus defense.\nJuventus should have taken the lead in the 35th following a great cut-back from the byline by Sami Khedira to Dybala but the Argentinian slipped.\nThe hosts did go in front four minutes from halftime when Juan Cuadrado, who was causing Sevilla problems on the right flank, cut back from the byline to Andrea Barzagli, who crossed for Morata to head into the bottom right corner.\nThe last player to score in five Champions League matches for Juventus was club great Alessandro del Piero. It was also Morata's seventh goal in his past nine games in the competition.\nDybala played a part in the second goal, winning back possession in a tussle with two Sevilla defenders and passing across to Zaza. The Italy forward had fresh legs after coming off the bench seven minutes earlier and he sprinted clear from near the halfway line before slotting past Rico.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:56:27.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
