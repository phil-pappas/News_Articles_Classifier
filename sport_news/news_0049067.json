Vonleh, 20, is more of a long-term project than McCollum or Plumlee, but the Blazers are enamored with his versatility, athleticism and upside.\nThe Blazers drafted McCollum, 24, with the No. 10 pick of the 2013 NBA Draft and he seems poised for a breakout season. He's averaged 6.3 points and 1.4 rebounds in 100 games over his first two seasons, but exploded in the final three games of the first round of the 2015 Western Conference playoffs, averaging 25.7 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals as the Blazers fell the Memphis Grizzlies.\nThe Blazers acquired Plumlee, 25, in a trade with the Brooklyn Nets during the NBA Draft in June. In two up-and-down seasons with the Nets, he averaged 8.1 points and 5.4 rebounds in 152 games. The Blazers are hopeful he can emerge as the long-term answer at center.\nVonleh arrived to Portland as the centerpiece of the Nicolas Batum trade with the Charlotte Hornets. The No. 9 pick of the 2014 NBA Draft played sparingly during his rookie season, averaging 3.3 points and 3.4 rebounds in 25 games.\n-- Joe Freeman | jfreeman@oregonian.com | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BlazerFreeman"], "published": "2015-09-30T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:17:20.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
