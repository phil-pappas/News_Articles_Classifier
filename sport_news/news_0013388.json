Asked whether Srinivasan as ICC head and Manohar as BCCI chief will affect the relations between the two organisations, Richardson replied in a negative. “No at the moment Mr Srinivasan is the BCCI representative to the ICC and we have no issues with that,” the former South African player said on sidelines of a function here. Manohar was critical of Srinivasan during the IPL spot-fixing scandal and asked the Tamil Nadu strongman to step down from the post of then BCCI president. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:09:53.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
