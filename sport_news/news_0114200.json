Andrews in April 2014 after Andrews charged at officers with knives and a carving fork, officials said.\n“Officer Hansford’s use of force was a lawful and reasonable exercise of self-defense and defense of others,” Conley said in a statement. “Indeed, Officer Hansford and the other officers did everything reasonably in their power to deescalate the situation before resorting to force.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The incident began when police responded to a call about domestic violence, according to the investigation. Officers were directed inside a home to speak to Andrews, 38, and confronted him in a small kitchen, officials said.\nAndrews then began pacing in the kitchen and taking off his clothes, officials said. Andrews, who suffered from a mental disorder , told officers he had not taken his medication.\nAndrews refused to leave the kitchen when asked to go outside, and he twice refused to comply with a police direction to put his arms behind his back, officials said.\nAndrews then picked up two kitchen knives, causing officers to draw their weapons and order him to drop his. Andrews then released a “loud, guttural scream,” raised the knives in his hands, and lunged at the officers, the investigation found.\nAndrews was then shot twice by Hansford. Andrews was rushed to the hospital, where he died.\n“After a careful consideration of the facts and the law, I conclude that Officer Hansford acted reasonably and lawfully,” Conley said.", "external_links": ["https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/04/08/man-shot-and-killed-police-saturday-identified/oeSVd8izIEX9fLBBNZhc4M/story.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:18:42.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
