Very.\nAdChoices Like, it happened once before.\nMORE: Chase drivers in trouble | Standings entering Kansas | Matt Kenseth's Charlotte nightmare\nWant to bet there are folks at Hendrick Motorsports with sore feet from kicking something after Johnson's incredible convergence of crisis?\nFreak chance, maybe, ended Johnson's run at a sixth Sprint Cup when a $50 part broke at Dover. \"Bro, I got something breaking big time in the car,” an agitated Johnson told crew chief Chad Knaus . “Whoa, something is locking up.\"\nThen despite a renewed focus on quality control, Johnson came up with a lame car a week later at Charlotte. It's stunning, really, to see Johnson finished 41st in one race, 39th in another.\n“It’s tough having a very inexpensive axle seal be the culprit and take your championship hopes away,\" Johnson said after Dover.\nDo a quit search for the price of a rear axle seal for a common car, and you'll find the gizmo could cost as less than $5. Figure it's on an elite NASCAR racer, and the price goes up to $50.\n\"It just shows how critical everything is on a race team,\" Johnson said after Dover. \"And how important every component is and you can’t take anything for granted.\nJohnson was running third at Charlotte when an oil pump let go. That killed his Chevy's engine knocked Johnson out of the race with 77 laps to go.\nCritics came of Twitter's woodwork to kick Johnson when he was down. His response to one?\nI thought I would get a little slack with the back to back part failures. Guess not. https://t.co/GsBjGdzKSB\n— Jimmie Johnson (@JimmieJohnson) October 12, 2015\nRemember that rarity thing? In 2004, Johnson rolled a sick car off the track in three consecutive races. Each time, the culprit was a sour engine.\nDover was Johnson's 500th race … and only twice did he exit consecutive races with mechanical failures.\n\"If I wrote down the list of inexpensive parts on the car that can fail at anytime on any given weekend, you'd blow your mind,\" Jeff Gordon said after the Dover race.\n\"We've never had any problems with our seals and everything's always looked good with our cars. You never know,\" teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. said, via The Associated Press . \"You hope you don't have an issue with that, and something as simple as that can ruin your day.\"\nThat's why drivers race every week. It's not how good they are or how good their teams are or how massive their teams are. Whether it's a NASCAR Sprint Cup car or a NASA space vehicle, one stinkin' $5 part is all it takes to produce failure.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://racing.ap.org/article/hendrick-teams-now-guarding-against-parts-failures-chase", "https://t.co/GsBjGdzKSB", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-11/matt-kenseth-chase-nascar-sprint-cup-crashes-charlotte-bad-finish-trouble", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658026-nascar-sprint-cup-charlotte-bank-of-america-500-chase-logano-harvick-kenseth-earnhardt-standings-winners-and-losers", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-06/jimmie-johnsons-miss-chase-nascar-dale-earnhardt-jr-clutch-pass-highlight-in-car-audio-dover-aaa-400", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657915-nascar-sprint-cup-chase-grid-standings-hollywood-casino-400kansas-city-gordon-harvick-kenseth-hamlin-busch", "https://twitter.com/JimmieJohnson/status/653665651899387904", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-04/nascar-sprint-cup-chase-dover-aaa-400-jimmie-johnson-standings", "http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/10/13/jimmie-johnson-elimination-chase-sprint-cup-series-victory-fantastic-rebuttal.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:00:15.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
