Maybe even win a game — or maybe even more — in the NCAA Tournament.\nThe Crusaders return, like, a gazillion percent of their production in every major statistical category from last season's team that pushed Maryland to the limit in the Round of 64.\nOK, that's not quite true.\nBut with the NCAA granting Vashil Fernandez, the league's reigning Defensive Player of the Year, a final season of eligibility, they return 98.8 percent of their scoring. And 98.8 percent of their rebounding, 99.5 of their assists, 100.0 of their steals and 97.5 of their blocked shots.\nPost-Tribune Football Stats thru Week 6 Steve Millar The Post-Tribune's individual stat leaders in rushing, passing, receiving, scoring and interceptions through the second week of the season.

We're still going to be learning about our team. I'm looking forward to that process with the guys, and seeing which guys catch a rhythm together.\"\nThe Crusaders add three \"new\" scholarship players to that mix.\nThe lone freshman is center Derrik Smits, the Indiana All-Star who is the son of former Pacers standout Rik Smits.\nShane Hammink figures prominently, after sitting out last season at Valparaiso following his transfer from LSU. On the trip to Canada, the junior showed his skills as a likely difference-maker.\nAnd point guard Lexus Williams, who started as a freshman, is back. He missed all of last season after tearing his left ACL last August, also breaking his kneecap in January before the Crusaders' game at Green Bay.\n\"He looks great,\" Drew said of Williams. \"He's cleared to play some, but we can't overdo it. We have to monitor what he can do.\"\nThe status of E. Victor Nickerson for the start of the regular season is uncertain. The senior underwent surgery on his right wrist and is expected to be out until November. He also had surgery on his left wrist on June 5.\nmosipoff@post-trib.com\nTwitter: @MichaelOsipoff\nCopyright © 2015, Post-Tribune College Basketball Valparaiso Crusaders College Sports Basketball Horizon League Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dbd62/turbine/ct-post-trib-football-stats-20150903", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560df2bc/turbine/ct-ptb-mens-basketball-valparaiso-st-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:34:07.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
