The aim of the station this year was to appreciate 'Delhi ke Heroes'.\nThe contest began in the first week of September, with the Mirchi team requesting Delhi residents to send nominations of people who are working towards the betterment of society voluntarily.\nThe most persuasive stories were selected as the top five finalists. For one week, the station voiced the story of these selected heroes through his or her personal interviews in all the shows. And Delhi listeners had to vote for their favourite contestant via sms.\nApart from Babbar, the finalists were Rajesh Kumar Singh, a college dropout who owns a general store at Shakarpur and runs a school under a flyover located on railway land; and Medicine Baba-Omkar Nath, who goes to many houses each day to collect medicines and donates them to those in need.\nThere was also Dorris Francis, a 57-year-old who lost her daughter in a car crash and since then has decided to get on that accident-prone intersection and manage traffic to make sure that no other commuter suffered her daughter's fate; and Sylvester Peter, who's at the helm of My Angels Academy, where economically challenged children learn meditation, academics and athletics.\nNitin Singh, station head, Radio Mirchi, said in a statement: \"This year Mirchi not only provided a dream come true reward but is also gave recognition to those who deserve it the most. We hope to continue in contributing to our society through our innovative concepts.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:17:56.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
