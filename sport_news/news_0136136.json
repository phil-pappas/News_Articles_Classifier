During the streak the Knights have outscored opponents 37-7 and they now sit comfortably atop the division standings with four games remaining against Valley Division teams. \n\"This win streak we have, we're going to propel ourselves into counties, states and hopefully catch a title in the future,\" junior Armeen Mozaffari said. \nOn Thursday Gill St. Bernard's seemed to control the tempo from the start, but didn't find the back of the net until there was 12:48 left in the first half. Junior Max Aunger had the ball in the corner at the left post and sent a pass across the goal where Mozaffari was waiting. Mozaffari headed the ball and sent it into the right corner to put the Knights ahead 1-0. \nThe Mountaineers kept battling and with 3:20 left in the first notched the equalizer. Dan Schindler took a direct kick from about the 18 and sent the ball towards the left post where Freddy Ludtke sent it into the goal. Knights goalie Aaron Hinton tried to corral the shot, but dropped it and Bernards tied the game 1-1. \n\"I expected it to be a tough game as always,\" junior Kevin Brito said. \"They usually come in, they always give us a tough match. They played well in the beginning and we got a good early go which really set the fire and we got more.\" \nGill outshot Bernards 5-3 in the first half, then turned it up on offense in the second half. With 19 minutes to play the Knights were fouled and awarded a penalty kick. Brito took the shot and sent it low and to the right to give Gill the 2-1 advantage. \n\"In countless games we've been down and we always just find a way to come back and win,\" Brito said. \nBernards kept trying to re-tie the game, but the Knights' offense kept them playing defense for most of the second half. With 14 minutes to play junior Anes Mrkulic almost put Gill ahead 3-1, but his shot hit off the center of the crossbar. \nWith under two minutes to play junior Steven Bednarsky sent a pass up to senior Danny Sivolella who found an opening and shot the ball past Mountaineers goalie Andres Lezme for a 3-1 lead. \n\"It worked out pretty well, we all fought hard at the end. It got real close and we just found an opening, I couldn't of done that without the team behind me,\" Sivolella said. \"It's huge, even though we have a pretty tight hold on the conference now, just beating Bernards is a great feeling.\" \nGill St. Bernard's outshot Bernards 13-4 and Hinton made three saves. For the Mountaineers, Lezme made 10 saves. \nStaff Writer Lauren Knego: lknego@gannettnj.com 2 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RwXlas TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:07:45.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
