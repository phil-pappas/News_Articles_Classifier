One is a board on which the team will display a puck from each victory with a label below indicating the score, the date and who scored the winning goal.\nThe other is a hard hat that is presented to a Devils player after each victory. This isn’t about acknowledging the team’s best player each game in terms of goals and assists or saves as much it is meant to symbolize the blue-collar approach Hynes wants his team to embrace.\nRight wing Kyle Palmieri was the first recipient because of the energy boost he provided with his fight against Kevin Klein in Sunday’s 2-1 overtime win over the Rangers. Palmieri presented it to center Travis Zajac following Tuesday’s 3-2 overtime win over Arizona.\nZajac hopes to pass it on to someone else after tonight’s game in Ottawa.\n\"Whoever had it the day before picks someone who they thought contributed or impacted the game,\" said Zajac, who had a goal and two assists Tuesday. \"It’s not necessarily the best or who had the most goals, but someone who impacted the game. That was Kyle with his spark the other game with his fight.\"\nIt’s a black hard hat with flames painted on it and a Devils puck fastened to the front. Not particularly attractive, but that’s not the point.\n\"It was something that we wanted to signify hard work,\" Hynes said, \"and things that are special to the makeup of the team that maybe don’t get recognized outside of the locker room or things that get recognized inside the locker room. [They can make] a difference a lot of times between winning and losing, and that will add glue to a team.\"\nHynes did something similar with his AHL teams in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, and many other professional teams, both in the NHL and other sports, have their versions of it.\nFormer Devils assistant Mike Foligno tried to start something similar in 2013-14 with a green jacket that was supposed to be worn by the recipient until it was passed on to another player following the team’s next win. That never really caught on, though, as the players didn’t seem to enjoy wearing it.\n\"This is new and it’s nice to start a tradition like this to recognize guys who had a good game and helped the team win,\" Zajac said.\nBRIEFS: LW Reid Boucher was assigned to Albany of the AHL after sitting out three of the team’s first six games. .. The Devils did not practice Wednesday before flying to Ottawa.\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:00:52.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
