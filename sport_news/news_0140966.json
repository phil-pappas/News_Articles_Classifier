And to be recognized by your peers is truly special.”\nFOR THE WIN\n9 things we learned from this crazy PGA Tour season\nIt certainly was an unforgettable season. Spieth, who capped one of the best campaigns in history by becoming the youngest to win The Tour Championship by Coca-Cola and the FedExCup last week, won the Vardon Trophy for lowest adjusted scoring average and the money title with a single-season record of $12,030,465. With the $10 million FedExCup bonus, he became the first $22 million man in Tour history.\nHe also became the youngest player since Horton Smith in 1929 to win five Tour titles in a season. In addition to his wins in the Masters, U.S. Open and the Tour Championship, Spieth won the Valspar Championship and the John Deere Classic. He had a Tour-leading 15 top-10s.\nSpieth finished runner-up in the PGA Championship and one shot out of a playoff in the British Open when he was chasing history as he tried to join Ben Hogan as the only players to win the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open in the same season. He added wins during the 2014-15 wraparound season at the Australian Open in November and the Hero World Challenge in December. Spieth is the youngest to win the award since Tiger Woods won the award at the age of 21 in 1997.\n“We had great years in 2013 and 2014 but certainly nothing was pointing to winning two majors and five tournaments,” Spieth said. “My goal was to win two to three times, compete in the majors and make the cut in all four majors, and make the Presidents Cup team.\nUSA TODAY\nJordan Spieth's exclamation point on dream season: FedExCup, $10M bonus\n“So as far as the season went, it far exceeded our expectations.”\nBerger, a 2014 graduate of the Web.com Tour, finished his season as the 45th-ranked player in the world. He was the only rookie to make it to The Tour Championship and finished 11th in the FedExCup.
