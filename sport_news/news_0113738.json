At no point was the outcome of the game in doubt. VVC scored on its first three possessions, punted once and turned the ball over on downs once late in the game. The Rams scored on 12 of their 15 possessions, with halftime ending one of them. VVC showed no signs of slowing down after last week’s loss to San Bernardino Valley College. The Rams still have a shot at a share of the American Mountain League title if they win out, as SBVC lost to conference foe College of the Desert. VVC piled up 612 yards of offense while allowing 82 defensively. The Rams earned five sacks, held Compton to just five first downs and picked up a pair of interceptions to go with a fumble recovery. “When we play good football we’re a very difficult team to beat,” said head coach Dave Hoover. “If we play good football San Jacinto is going to be in trouble, too.” Sam Allen threw four touchdown passes, rushed in for one and finished the day with 237 yards on 11 of 18 passing. Desmond Johnson rushed for two touchdowns and caught another, while Jason Knowles, Aaron Parker and Dakota Prussia also got in on the scoring action. Defensively the Rams were as good as they’ve been all season. Arizona State University commit Dougladson Subtyl continued to be an absolute nightmare for opposing offensive lines as he racked up 2.5 sacks. Dennis Nguyen added 1.5 sacks of his own. Compton’s best chance at getting on the board turned into VVC points as Ty’rail Hawkins returned an interception 95 yards. After grabbing the pick he evaded multiple defenders and then turned on the jets to put the Rams up by 72. Oshea White also had an interception for VVC. Johnson let the Rams in rushing with 115 yards on four carries, while Parker continued to be the featured back. He rushed for 106 yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown early in the third quarter. Devonte Milligan picked up 101 yards on four catches and added a touchdown. Malik Odom caught three passes for 44 yards. Things get tougher next week at home against Mt. San Jacinto College. The Eagles are fifth in the Southern California Football Association in yards allowed per game (294.2). The Rams are No. 1 at 264.3. That game kicks off at 1 p.m. Oct. 31 at VVC.
