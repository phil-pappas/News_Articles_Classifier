Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 9:30 AM DUTCHTOWN Last Friday night, Zachary's reigning 5A Offensive Player of the Year, Lindsey Scott Jr. and Dutchtown's Jared Sparks collided for an entertaining quarterback duel. Nearly 1,000 total yards and 78 points later, the sixth-ranked Broncos escaped with a hard-fought 44-34 shootout victory that spoiled the Griffins' Homecoming celebration. Scott--a recent Syracuse commit--is no stranger to Dutchtown. He actually attended the school back when he was a freshman, before eventually transferring to Zachary. His 397-yard, five-touchdown onslaught held off a feisty Griffin squad that fought off two 15-point deficits to take the lead late in the third quarter. \"I thought that they battled their behinds off. They played hard till the end,\" Dutchtown head coach Benny Saia said. \"We have to play a little better, keep that intensity and I think we'll win our share of games.\" The Bronco offense was rolling early as they drove 52 yards in eight plays to start the game. Scott powered the ball in from one yard out and then converted the two-point try to put them up 8-0. They scored again to start the second quarter when Scott hit Douglas Coleman on a tunnel screen, and he took it 53 yards for a touchdown to give Zachary a 15-0 advantage. Dutchtown responded with a seven-play, 69-yard drive that was capped off by a 12-yard touchdown run by Fitell Bolding to cut the lead to 15-7. After falling down 22-7, the Griffins were able to cut back into the deficit right before the half. They drove 76 yards on 11 plays. Once again, Bolding ran it in from five yards out to head into halftime with a 22-14 deficit. The Griffins scored on their opening possession of the third quarter as they moved the ball 70 yards in just five plays. Bolding stayed hot as he broke loose on a 26-yard touchdown run to the outside to bring Dutchtown within one at 22-21. After the Griffin defense forced Zachary to turn the ball over on downs, the Dutchtown offense went right back on the attack. Sparks scrambled out of pressure and found a wide open Cornelius Washington down the sideline. Washington raced in for a 70-yard score to give the Griffins their first lead of the game at 27-22. Scott and the Broncos answered right back. They pushed the ball 70 yards on seven plays and regained a 30-27 lead when Scott hit Shyron White for a 15-yard score. They extended the lead in the fourth when they broke out the trickery. They scored on a 53-yard touchdown pass that was tossed by a receiver, after catching a backwards pass in the backfield. Trailing by 10, Dutchtown went back on the move. They went 80 yards in just six plays and cut it to 37-34 with a 19-yard touchdown connection from Sparks to Averee York. Page 2 of 2 - With the game still in doubt, Scott took over. On fourth-and-one at their own 39, Scott lunged ahead for three yards to keep the drive alive. Later, Scott was stymied for a sure loss, but he slipped away and raced 65 yards for the game-clinching score that would have made Tommie Frazier proud. He ended up going 14-19 for 210 yards and two touchdowns through the air, while adding 187 yards and three scores on the ground. \"He was the difference in the game. It wasn't a surprise, but he got them out of a lot of trouble,\" Saia said. \"We had some big plays, too. There were some good things that we did tonight. If that was the No. 6 team in the state, then we're not far behind. We have to see that, grow from that and get better.\" Sparks had his best game as the Griffin starting quarterback. He completed 18 of 24 passes for 307 yards and two touchdowns. He added 40 yards on the ground. Washington had five catches for 118 yards and a score. York had six grabs for 93 yards and a touchdown. Bolding led the Griffin ground attack with 67 yards and three scores on 12 carries. \"When you're swimming upstream, it's hard. That's what we did. We dug a hole; we got out of it, but it took so much energy getting out of it,\" Saia said. \"We had a chance. You can't blink in a game like this. You have to make plays. We just let one series get away that cost us.\" The loss put an end to Dutchtown's three-game winning streak. At 3-2, they'll now step into district play as they hit the road to face district newcomer Broadmoor.
