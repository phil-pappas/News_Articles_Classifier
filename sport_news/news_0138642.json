The World Squad had battled back to tie the score several times during the weekend, only for the Americans to eventually regain the lead, and the closing session in South Korea fittingly came down to the last match on the schedule. \nWe start with the team score tied at 12-and-a-half, and that missed putt by Anirban Lahiri at 18 hands a 1-UP win to Chris Kirk. The Internationals in disbelief as the USA regain the lead. \nBritish Open champ Zach Johnson then birdies 16 to defeat PGA Championship winner Jason Day 3-and-2, putting the Americans ahead by a deuce in the team tally. \nThe World Squad roars back as Marc Leishman's par putt at 18 gives the Aussie a 1-UP victory over the top ranked player in the sport, Jordan Spieth, before Branden Grace beats Matt Kuchar to tie things again at 14-and-a-half. \nSo it all comes down to the final match, and Sang-Moon Bae badly fluffs his approach at 18, with all the weight of the host nation's fans on his shoulders in this winner-take-all showdown against Bill Haas, and the South Korean is almost inconsolable after that horrific swing. \nThen the son of the US Team's captain chips out of the bunker and rolls the ball into the shadow of the flag to heap even more pressure on Bae, and when the American sinks his follow-up putt, the clock runs out on the crowd favorite, so Bae has no choice but to concede the match. The USA win 15-and-a-half to 14-and-a-half, their ninth victory in 11 editions of the Presidents Cup, and this one is particularly special for the Haas family.
