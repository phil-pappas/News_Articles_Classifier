Right now I see two of you.’’\nYet still, Rose wasn’t ruling out playing Opening Night against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday, and was even looking to try and get a few minutes in Friday night’s preseason finale against Dallas in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nShare Events on The Cube\n“It’s kind of bad, but it’s preseason you know, so it’s all about getting out there and playing, just playing a couple of minutes and seeing how it goes,’’ Rose said of the problem he’s been having with his vision. “It’s just catching the ball, sometimes it’s hard to get the perception on the ball and how fast it’s going.’’\nRose, however, seems willing to take a vision-be-damned attitude when it comes to the opener, especially considering the bad taste that’s still in his mouth after Cleveland eliminated the Bulls in the Eastern Conference semifinals last season in what appeared to be a complete white flag Game 6.\n“The way it ended, I think that’s why most of us are working so hard during the offseason because we know we didn’t end things right,’’ Rose said. “This is a new beginning for us, and usually in the NBA when you get a new beginning you’re more focused.\n“I mean for anybody opening night is opening night. It’s when the season starts, so it’s your showcase to show everybody what you been doing the entire summer. So it’s a big night, but at the same time if I feel like I can’t go there’s no point in rushing it or pushing myself.’’\nThen there’s the matter of Rose’s conditioning. Going out against the Mavericks on Friday night for a few minutes just to get some run in would be one thing. The emotion of opening the season at the United Center against the one player in LeBron James who has eliminated the Bulls from the playoffs four out of the last six seasons?\nThat’s why first-year coach Fred Hoiberg was a bit more guarded.\n“If he’s going to play in the opener, it’d be nice to see him out there for a little bit of time in game action [Friday],’’ Hoiberg said. “I don’t know if it’s an absolute. It would certainly help for him to get that game speed. He’s been doing a lot of work but it’s been mostly one-on-one or five-on-0 settings.\n“To have him out there [Thursday], there’s a lot of rust, which there should be. I think it’d be great for him if he could do it. If not, and he’s got double vision, we’re obviously not playing him.’’\nNot the only major decision Hoiberg and his staff have to weigh by Tuesday, either.\nThe coach did admit that he would once again start Nikola Mirotic over Joakim Noah in the exhibition finale, as it sounded like that Noah would begin the regular season coming off the bench. It would be the first time since the middle of his second season that Noah wasn’t a regular starter.\n“Jo’s a pro,’’ Hoiberg said, when asked about discussing that decision with Noah. “All our guys are. Whatever we decide to do on the 27 th isn’t necessarily what we’ll do on Nov. 1. It’s just to start the season. It’s not an easy decision however we start, but it’s not an absolute.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:39:05.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
