J. Spiller with an 80 yard touchdown pass on the second play of overtime as the New Orleans Saints defeated the Dallas Cowboys 26-20, snapping the Saints’ six game home losing streak at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome Sunday night. \nThe Saints had a chance to win it in regulation as Brees marched the Saints 68 yards in eight plays with no time outs remaining. Brees completed passes of 17 yards to Willie Sneed and 30 yards to Brandon Coleman to get the Saints into field goal range. But Zach Hocker missed a 30 yard field goal attempt, which hit off the left upright, forcing the extra period. \nThe Saints won the toss and started at their 20 yard line. Brees’ pass to Khiry Robinson was dropped, but on the second play, Brees hit Spiller in stride and the former Buffalo running back broke one tackle and streaked down the sidelines for the game winner. \nIt was the 400th touchdown pass of Brees’ career. \nBrees completed 33-41 passes for 359 yards and two scores. Mark Ingram carried 17 times for 77 yards to lead the Saints rushing attack. It was the first win of the year for the Saints (1-3) while Dallas, playing its second straight game without Tony Romo, fell to 2-2. \nDallas got points on its first possession, driving 74 yards on eight plays. Lance Dunbar had a 45 yard run to the New Orleans 27 but the Saints’ defense stiffened and the Cowboys settled for a 30 yard field goal by Dan Bailey. \nThe Saints came right back, however, driving 80 yards in eleven plays. Nine of the plays were passing plays, with Drew Brees finding Josh Hill with the three yard touchdown pass to give the Saints a 7-3 lead. \nJoseph Randle got the lead back for the Cowboys on the next possession with a one yard touchdown run. The Saints had three penalties on the defense during the drive. \nAfter the Saints forced a punt on the third quarter’s first possession, Michael Murphy returned the punt to the Dallas 38. The Saints couldn’t move the football but Dallas was penalized for having twelve men on the field which moved the ball five yards closer and Zach Hocker nailed a 51 yard field goal to tie the game. \nThe Saints looked to have forced a three and out on Dallas’ next possession but Delvin Breaux was hit with a penalty on third down and the Cowboys took advantage, hitting a 67 yard pass play to Bryce Butler to set up a 38 yard field goal by Bailey to regain the lead for the Cowboys with 8:35 to go in the third quarter, 13-10. \nThe Saints then moved from their 20 to the Dallas 11, which set up another Hocker field goal to re-tie the game at 13. The Saints mixed the run and the pass on the 13-play drive, with Brees completing six passes on the drive. \nThe Saints then embarked on an eleven play, 67 yard drive to take the lead. Brees completed six of seven passes in the drive but the final 24 yards were covered on the ground with Khiry Robinson getting the touchdown and a 20-13 lead with eight minutes left. \nAfter an exchange of punts, Dallas came back with an eight play, 91 yard drive. Brandon Weeden completed passes of 24, 28 and 19 yards. The Saints forced a fourth down and seven from the 17, but Weeden hit Terrance Williams, who made a diving catch for the score that tied the game with 1:51 left. \nWeeden was 16-26 for 246 yards. Dallas was led on the ground by Lance Dunbar with 51 yards. Both teams played turnover free football. \nThe Saints take on Philadelphia next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:04:18.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
