Two mistakes and two goals for them. We played hard and I think we proved we can play with those bigger teams. \n\"They just play a different style than we are used to, a little more physical. If we want to take the next step, we have to address that.\" \nEven though Mattoon lost, it doesn't take away any of the accomplishments the Green Wave set this season. Mattoon finished with an 18-3-1 record, which is the best winning percentage and most wins in Green Wave history. The team also set the record for most goals in a season. \nThe Green Wave took a 1-0 lead in the 24th minute when Trey Skocy threw in a ball from the side. Cole Kidwell tracked the throw, which landed right in front of the goal. Kidwell got to the ball before Central could and kicked it in for the score. \nCentral's equalizer came in the 30th minute. Mattoon keeper Chase Vogt came out of the goal to get to a ball, but Central's Ben Jefferson beat him to it. Even though he was wide of the goal, his shot still found the net to tie the match. \n\"Chase was in a bad spot and once you make the decision to come, you have to come,\" Ghere said. \"You can't get caught halfway. That was an very tough angle for (Jefferson). We had a couple of defenders bust their butts to try and clear it, they were just late.\" \nThe Green Wave almost took the lead in the 38th minute. Skocy threw the ball in and Nick Owens was able to get his foot on the ball and took a shot, but it hit off the bottom of the crossbar. That sent the ball to the ground and it bounced away from the goal after that. \nCentral took advantage and went on the attack and took a shot. Vogt saved it, but Central got the rebound and Jefferson scored for the second time for a 2-1 lead in the 30th minute. \n\"Chase made a great save and we got caught ball watching,\" Ghere said. \"They did a nice job of countering.\" \nVogt made five saves in the match. \nMattoon had plenty of chances in the final 10 minutes. The Green Wave had three shots on goal and three corner kicks, but couldn't came away with any points. \nContact Rust at jrust@jg-tc.com or 217-238-6856.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:55:17.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
