She’s currently starring on the Bearkats’ volleyball team, undefeated in Division I, District 1 play, and she is really, really good on the softball field. \nFrom Bearcat to Tiger \nGoff caught the attention of the LSU coaching staff this summer and was offered a scholarship by the 2015 Women’s College World Series participants that were ranked No. 1 in the country at one point last season. \n“It’s kinda crazy how things work out,” said Goff, who almost decided to play travel ball during the summer with a Texas team before opting to play for the Patriots out of Baton Rouge. That team is coached by Darrell Landry, father of current Lady Tigers’ outfielder Bailey Landry. Ruston maintains lead in volleyball \n“He put in a good word for me with the LSU coaches. They came and watched me, and liked my swing,” Goff said. “I don’t think anything compares to LSU — it’s everything I wanted in a school. It was perfect.” \nThe Goff family initially kept the verbal commitment in-house for fear the LSU decision might not sit well in Ruston due her father’s profession. But there have been no repercussions in a forgiving community, and Goff couldn’t receive an athletic scholarship to Tech anyway. An NCAA rule stipulates that a coach at a school must work there at least five years before their child can be awarded an athletic scholarship to the school, according to Greg Goff. \n“I’ve always told my girls that they won’t be the smartest in the world, so they’d better get athletic scholarships,” said Greg Goff tongue-in-cheek. “With Kara, it’s been softball, softball, softball. She has worked very hard to get to this point, and God has had a plan for her.” \nShe even missed prom to play softball. Her Patriots team competes nearly every fall weekend in places like Houston, Dallas or Sulphur. \n“My wife (Tina, a former swimmer at Delta State) loads up the girls on Friday and heads out,” Goff said.
