Hughes | Oct 08, 2015 Photo by: Pat Irelan Kevin Harvick celebrates his win at Dover Downs Oct. 4. \nDover — NASCAR’s version of playoffs known as the Chase for the Sprint Cup came to Dover for a rare October race (first since 1971) at The Monster Mile. Kevin Harvick did his best to play Mr. October with a clutch performance that left little doubt he was the class of the field and perhaps the favorite moving forward in the chase. The win was Harvick’s 31st career Sprint Cup victory and the first in 24 races. \nEntering Sunday, Harvick had one choice and one goal: win to get in or be on the outside looking in. Mission accomplished. \nFriday’s qualifying was washed out by rain, setting the field based on point standings. Saturday’s practice was shortened by rain too. Harvick was fastest in Saturday’s last practice session, setting the stage for Sunday’s race. The cool temperatures also alleviated the typical tire concerns coming into Dover. However, there were many story lines leading up to Sunday’s AAA 400 besides the nor’easter and threat of a hurricane. \nIt was Jeff Gordon’s last visit to Dover and his 46th Sprint Cup start at the track. Gordon had success as a five-time Dover winner with 92 total Sprint Cup victories. He also captured four poles at Dover. \nDover International Speedway will honor Gordon in 2016 with a plaque added to the Miles the Monster statue in Victory Plaza on the Route 1 side of the grandstands. Many fans were likely there to see Gordon for the last time before he moves to the Fox broadcast booth. \nThree top drivers considered contenders for the championship were in danger of being eliminated from the next round of the chase: defending series champion Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Could Harvick win in a must-win race? Could fan favorite Dale Earnhardt Jr. advance? Would bad luck dog Kyle Busch once again? \nEarnhardt Jr. was just inside the top 12 coming into Dover trailing Jamie McMurray by one point for 11th, with Busch and Menard only one point out of 12th place. Each position on the track counts as one point. Harvick and Bowyer knew their only chance to advance was a win. Busch and Menard needed to finish near the front, and Earnhardt Jr. and McMurray needed to beat each other and finish near the front to ensure a spot in the next round for one of the drivers. That is what it would come down to in the closing laps for the 1 and 88 teams. \nWhen the green flag fell Sunday, Matt Kenseth jumped out to an early lead. A quick caution flag flew early at lap 3 for Jeb Burton wrecking in Turn 2. Kenseth jumped to the lead again on the Lap 6 restart with a hard-charging Kevin Harvick up to fifth. It wasn’t long before Harvick overtook Kenseth, moving into the lead on Lap 24 and checking out to a three-second lead. Except for a few lead changes, Harvick never looked back, leading a staggering 355 of 400 total laps. Only Harvick, pole sitter Kenseth and Kyle Busch led the race. \nRegan Smith wins Xfinity Series Hisense 200 \nSaturday’s Hisense 200 Xfinity Series race started as scheduled and managed to finish all 200 laps with only a brief rain delay. Points leader Chris Buescher looked to extend his lead while defending series champion Chase Elliot looked to creep closer to consecutive titles. Ty Dillon and Regan Smith also looked to bolster their chances with Smith doing so, driving to the win over Sprint Cup regulars Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch. \nRyan Blaney and Busch started on the front row Saturday. Kyle Busch led 110 of the first 112 laps, seemingly poised for the victory with the strongest car. Clean air proved to be critical, though, and when deciding whether to pit after halfway with rain pending, Busch went to the pit and fell back to fourth when rain began falling. Busch later said he got behind the 20 and then could not do anything. Elliot Sadler took two tires to come out first followed by Regan Smith, Denny Hamlin, Kyle Busch, and Ryan Blaney. \nOn the Lap 118 restart, Sadler quickly fell to fourth with Smith, Hamlin, and Busch the leaders. Smith maintained the lead to the finish, taking the checkered flag and gaining on the points leader. Rounding out the Top 5 were Hamlin, Busch, Blaney and Kyle Larson. Smith is now 36 points behind Buescher. Chase Elliot, saving fuel on the last green flag run, finished seventh and is second in points 24 points back. Ty Dillon finished 28th, dropping to fourth place, 39 points behind the leader. \nEarlier in the day, the K & N Pro-Series race was made up from the originally scheduled Friday afternoon start. Collin Cabre won the race. Kevin Harvick had to win the race on Sunday in order to advance to the next round of the Chase for the Championship, and he did so by leading the most laps of the day.
