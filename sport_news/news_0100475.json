But before he departed for 23, Amla broke Virat Kohli's record to become the fastest to reach 6000 runs in ODIs. \nAmla achieved the feat in his 126th match and 123rd innings. Kohli had taken 144 matches and 136 innings to reach the same landmark. \nThe 32-year-old Amla has scored his runs at the terrific average of 52.70 and strike rate of 89.36. \nAs South African coach Russell Domingo reminded the media before the match, there are only two batsmen to have an average of 50+ in both Tests and ODIs and both of them are in the current South African side: Amla and AB de Villiers. \nAmla also has 21 tons in those 126 games at an astounding ratio of one in every six games. \nHis average, however, has dipped during this series. He has scored just 89 runs in the five matches, his lowest in any ODI series in which he has batted for four or more innings. \nSouth Africa will be hoping that Amla regains form before the Test series which kicks off on November 5 in Mohali. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:25:56.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
