There were no stacks of boxes filled with t-shirts and hats awaiting word to go on late night sale at Academy Sports. There was no stop down of SportsCenter with extensive coverage and live locker room interviews in the booze rain. Nope, none of that happened, but all you need to know is FC Dallas are the 2015 MLS Western Conference Champions.\nLet that wash over your soccer brainpan.\nSaturday night the league's lowest payroll, and a team barely with anyone who even qualifies as a \"designated player\", won the West with a game remaining. In fact, with that final game next weekend (Sunday, in Frisco, vs San Jose 6pm) the Huntsman could also win the Supporter's Shield. That would be the prize designated to the team from the entire league with the most points. Think, how teams win soccer leagues everyplace else.\nFor their troubles, Dallas will get a bye in the playoffs, home field advantage (if you want to call it that) and a place in the CONCACAF Champions League. That's something they've not seen since 2011 and how the club chooses to manage that new opportunity will be fascinating. More games, tougher teams, bigger challenges will be a new twist in how FC Dallas looks next year. The Hunts will just have to pony up for some additional firepower for that, right? Right?\nSee, if all of this is new to you, FCD's owners are under constant fire and questioning for how they built this roster, again the smallest spend in the league, yet they will point to this championship and the t-shirts we certainly will get, eventually, and claim \"scoreboard\". Deservedly so.\nAnd that is the greatly confusing thing about this club. For all the wailing and gnashing of teeth over \"the cheap, penny-pinching Hunts\", they just won the West. Not just qualified for the playoffs. Won. The. West. The tougher of the two conferences and its a prize reflective of the entire season. Not just the next step, the almost roll-of-the-dice MLS Playoffs.\nFC Dallas could get dumped in the first round and the naysayers will be back with ammo - of late the playoffs have been the place the larger salary, star studded teams begin to really show themselves - and it will be wholly unfair because what Pareja and Co. pulled off last night is downright amazing and commendable. Remember though last season FCD was the side that fell out of the playoffs on the goofy \"away-goals rule\" against Seattle, with its emerald covered roster, without ever actually lo sing to them.\nFair or not, in America, it's all about the Playoffs and that is the next mountain to climb. It's likely the 'little payroll from Frisco' will end up facing teams with single players that make more than everyone on FCD combined, but that hasn't stopped this team all season. They're probably tired of hearing it.\nFC Dallas is the new MLS Western Conference Champions.
