They won just one conference game in 2013 and three last season.\nAfter beating Kent State, Western Illinois and Middle Tennessee and getting thrashed at North Carolina, Illinois is feeling more confident heading into Saturday's Big Ten opener in Champaign against Nebraska.\n\"We play better defense than the previous couple years,\" interim coach Bill Cubit said at his weekly Monday news conference. \"Our offensive line is playing better. We're a little more physical than we've been. The kids' mindsets are pretty good.\"\nThe Cornhuskers (2-2) are trying to find their equilibrium as well. They have been prolific on offense but have struggled on defense.\nNebraska leads the Big Ten in passing (324.8 yards per game) and ranks second in total offense (519.5) behind quarterback Tommy Armstrong and former Montini receiver Jordan Westerkamp, who leads the conference with 26 receptions and has 351 yards and four touchdowns.\n\"They're throwing the ball well,\" Cubit said \"They've got some wideouts who are pretty good players. They're going to be on fire about coming here.\"\nOptimism aside, the Illini realize there are areas for improvement. Lots of it.\nThey have scored in only 14 of 19 trips to the red zone, 11 of them touchdowns. The return game has been mostly ineffective. And while the defense has looked improved in the victories, it proved porous in the 48-14 loss at North Carolina.\n\"We've got a ways to go, like everyone in the country,\" Cubit said.\nHeading into the Big Ten opener, Cubit is hoping for a steady approach.\n\"We've got to do it the right way,\" he said. \"Sometimes we expend too much energy early in the week. The biggest thing is to concentrate and focus on what we've got to do. \"\nAnd hope that translates this year into the entire Big Ten season.\nsryan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @sryantribune\n Illinois Fighting Illini Big Ten Nebraska Cornhuskers", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5609cebe/turbine/ct-illinois-big-ten-season-spt-0929-20150928"], "published": "2015-09-29T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:04:37.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
