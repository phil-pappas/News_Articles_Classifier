Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com\nExplanations were difficult to describe in the immediate aftermath.\nShafer said it was \"a little thick\" on a day in which the temperature was 86 degrees at kickoff, but that hardly should be used as an excuse, he said.\nPlayers offered their own explanation for the lack of effort early on, but few answers will likely provide much satisfaction after being gifted an extra week of preparation and the return of quarterback Eric Dungey and hybrid Ervin Philips.\nZaire Franklin : \"I felt a little slow just coming out. I don't know what it was, but the first road game of the year, first and foremost, first time we were playing outside the (Carrier) Dome. We don't make any excuses for us. It's our job to come out and play the game, our brand of football every time, and I feel as though we didn't get that done today. We just have to be better on the road next time.\"\nJordan Fredericks : \"We didn't just come out to play the game we usually play. The heat shouldn't have been a big factor because we play in the Dome a lot, but (South Florida) really came out to play today.\n\"We just didn't come to execute like we usually do, and they came out, punched us in the mouth and they came up on top.\"\nErvin Philips : \"We didn't have enough energy. We came out there kind of flat.\"\nPerhaps no words summed up the feeling after this loss better than the three Shafer said quietly to no one in particular while walking toward the team bus, engine idling just down the tunnel.\n\"Let's get home,\" he said.\nContact Nate Mink anytime: 315-430-8253 | Email | Twitter | Facebook | Google+", "external_links":
