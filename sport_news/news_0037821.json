Weider is no longer the coach, athletic director Brandon Renoll confirmed. (File -- GameTimePA.com) \nSince Oct. 1, the Kennard-Dale football team has used co-coaches to replace former head coach Patrick Weider, who is no longer with the team, according to athletic director Brandon Renoll. \nRenoll would not comment on whether Weider was dismissed or left voluntarily. But Renoll said since Week 5, the Rams have used former assistants Eric Updegrove and Christopher Grube as head coaches. \n\"We're going through a two-coach system,\" Renoll said. \"Both are considered co-head coaches.\" \nA decision on whether to open the head coaching position in the offseason will be made at a later date, Renoll added. \nThe school board's October agenda stated, \"It is recommended by the Superintendent that the termination of a football coach at Kennard-Dale High School, effective October 1, 2015, be accepted.\" \nWeider, who was 2-12 in 14 games at the helm for Kennard-Dale, did not respond to calls or emails.
