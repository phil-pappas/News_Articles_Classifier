His 36-yard score through the air with just under two minutes to go put a scare into Pittsburg, which hasn't lost in the BVAL since 2012. \nBut the Pirates (5-1, 1-0 BVAL) pulled it out thanks to Boyd's touchdown catch from senior quarterback Christian Young and an interception by senior cornerback Jordan Parker. Young was 25-for-36 passing for 287 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe Falcons (3-3) led 21-20 in the third quarter because of two catches for 56 by junior tight end Gio Fauolo, the second with one hand, that set up a 1-yard score by Rivers. \n\"Hats off to them,\" Galli said. \"It's too bad somebody has to lose the game.\" \nBut Pittsburg responded with a 16-play drive concluded by senior CJ McClure's 3-yard touchdown run, though the two-point conversion didn't work. \nGalli now has 114 wins with the Pirates, passing Pat Bryant (1927-1943). \nIn the first half, Pittsburg opened the scoring with an eight-play, 80-yard drive. The biggest gain was a screen pass Parker took 25 yards with a few moves, setting up Young's 14-yard touchdown toss to senior Namontte Grisby. Advertisement \nRivers responded, running 60 yards on the kickoff return and 26 more to the end zone on a carry two plays later to tie things up. \nTwo Pittsburg penalties early the second quarter gave Freedom good field position. Rivers picked up a first down into Pirates territory before Joe Sweeney hit senior Gio Fauolo on a slant pattern. Fauolo made a defender miss and scooted for the 41-yard touchdown that pushed Freedom ahead 14-7. \nYoung found Boyd and Bobby Myers for consecutive first downs, and Isaiah Turner picked up another one. Then Young was sacked twice by Freedom and was picked off by senior Ryan Mucher -- but a hands-to-the-face penalty on the Falcons negated the play to keep the drive alive. Junior Alberto Hernandez kicked a 30-yard field goal to bring Pittsburg within 14-10. \nAfter a three-and-out, the Pirates struck again. Junior Montaz Thompson broke three tackles and scampered 40 yards, then finished it off from 3 yards out. \nOn the fourth play of the second half, senior Michael Pryor picked off Sweeney on a pass that senior Iffy Jones tipped at the line of scrimmage. That set up a 24-yard field goal by Hernandez.
