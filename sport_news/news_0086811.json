Behind the accurate arm of quarterback Mason Rudolph, the Cowboys have managed to do enough to win their first five games of the season, although the difficulty with which they dispatched non-contenders Texas and Kansas State hasn’t been encouraging. This may not be the most talented team Mike Gundy has fielded in his 11 years as Oklahoma State head coach, but nevertheless, they have enough to give West Virginia a very tough day at the office Saturday. Here’s a look at several of Oklahoma State’s players to watch. Mason Rudolph, Quarterback, No. 2 After having to deal with a shifty, athletic quarterback last week in Baker Mayfield, West Virginia’s defense will be tested on Saturday by Mason Rudolph, a more traditional pocket passer who has seen tremendous success since he was inserted into the starting lineup at the end of last season. A 6-foot-4 sophomore from Rock Hill, South Carolina, Rudolph has won his last seven starts as Oklahoma State quarterback, and has been rather prolific along the way. Not a running threat, and not particularly mobile in the pocket, Rudolph relies on pure arm talent – and while Oklahoma State can rely on the run, Rudolph helps the machine work with his accuracy. Rudolph has completed about two-thirds of his passing attempts this season, throwing for nearly 1,700 yards, nine touchdowns and four interceptions along the way. Last week, he threw for 437 yards and three touchdowns as he led Oklahoma State to a late win over Kansas State. Many Oklahoma State fans are calling for the Cowboy coaching staff to let Rudolph throw the ball more, and with good reason – he has the ability to pick a defense apart in the short to intermediate game. David Glidden, Wide Receiver, No. 13 Rudolph lacks the downfield weapons that Oklahoma has – junior Marcell Ateman is his only real threat to go deep – but receivers like David Glidden allow him to dissect defenses. Your prototypical hard-working, undersized slot receiver, the senior Glidden has battled through injuries to establish himself as Rudolph’s favorite target in his senior season. Quick and elusive at 5-foot-8, Glidden leads Oklahoma State in receiving yards, receptions and receiving touchdowns, ranking fourth in the conference in receiving yards with 407. Glidden caught eight balls for 83 yards against Kansas State last week – incidentally, it was Dana Holgorsen who helped recruit Glidden to Oklahoma State, during the West Virginia head coach’s one-year stint as one of Mike Gundy’s assistants. \"He’s a good little player,\" Holgorsen said. \"When I worked at Oklahoma State, he was from Oklahoma City. We watched him, and I liked him. I offered him, and we started recruiting him. He didn’t play for a couple of years, but it worked out well for him. It was a good fit.\" Emmanuel Ogbah, Defensive End, No. 38 Perhaps no one else on Oklahoma State’s roster presents more problems for West Virginia than Emmanuel Ogbah, the Cowboys’ Nigerian nightmare. Oklahoma State leads the nation in sacks and tackles for loss, due in no small part to the efforts of Ogbah, a strong and quick workhorse of a defensive end who the Big 12 leader in sacks (6.5) and tackles for loss (9.5). His sack total is fourth-best in Division I, while his counterpart on the other side of the line, senior Jimmy Bean, has four sacks and is second in the conference in tackles for loss. At 6-foot-4, 275 pounds, Ogbah is regarded as one of the top defensive end prospects for the upcoming NFL Draft. He can overpower you, but he can also beat you with his athleticism – he’s truly one of the elite defensive ends in college football today, and West Virginia’s offensive line may be in for a long night. Last week, small and energetic outside linebacker Eric Striker gave West Virginia absolute hell on the edge, becoming one of the Oklahoma game’s biggest playmakers. The Mountaineers face a different sort of challenge with Ogbah, a more traditional 4-3 defensive end. West Virginia was forced to shuffle their offensive linemen against Oklahoma, including moving starting guard Adam Pankey back to tackle with Yodny Cajuste struggling to get any sort of handle on Striker. Still, Holgorsen judged that his tackles did well enough one-on-one last week and said he’s confident they can handle the challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:39:05.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
