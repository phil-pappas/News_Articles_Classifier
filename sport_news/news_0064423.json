Owners would not be allowed to use tethers that could cause entanglement or injury. Also, water bowls must be mounted or weighed down. Crates for dogs would also have changes. Pet owners could only use enclosed structures with one door and it must be insulated and kept at least two inches from the ground to avoid moisture seeping through the bottom. \n\"I think we're just taking it too far,\" Lancaster City Councilman, Michael Fracassa said. \nFracassa wants to protect animals, but says the ordinance, which does not differentiate between outside and indoor pets, is a burden on tax payers. \n\"I think it's too restrictive to animal owners,\" he said. \nBut Fairfield Area Humane Society Executive Director, Corey Schoonover, says if you've seen horror stories like he has of animals being left out, Fracassa might think differently. \n\"When you see that on a daily basis, I don't think you would think it's too restrictive,\" Schoonover said. \nDog owners, like Morgan, say what's being asked is not too much. \n\"These are the bare minimums that these animals deserve,\" she said. \nLancaster City Council is expected to approve or deny the proposed ordinance, Monday. The council will meet at 6:00 p.m. Â©2015 by 10TV.com. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
