Three others transferred, while three were dismissed, including lead scorer Marcus Foster. \nJust last month, forward Brandon Bolden elected to end his career due to injury. \nBut the subject of last year isn’t something the K-State coaches and players are spending much time on these days. \n“I am definitely done with last year,” Iwundu said before practice on Thursday. “That one is for the books. It’s a brand-new year, and I’m ready to get the season going.” \nK-State returns six players who’ve previously worn its uniform, while 10 others joined the roster by way of scholarship or walk-on. \nJustin Edwards, Stephen Hurt and former walk-on Brian Rohleder make up the seniors, while Iwundu returns with the most experience. D.J. Johnson returns to the roster after a yearlong injury recovery. \nBut the signs that things are changing are all over. K-State coach Bruce Weber said he likes what he sees from his current group and is happy they are no longer dealing with the things that plagued the team last season. \nThere have been no more issues to deal with in practice, and nothing going on off the court either, he says. \n“We have removed ourselves from last year since the summer,” he said. “I always talk about Tigger and Eeyore. We got some Tiggers. Eeyores are no fun to coach or be friends with and we have guys happy, bouncing around, flying around, enjoying it. \n“I always ask them, ‘Do you want to hang around with Eeyore? Or do you want to hang around with Tigger? \n“I don’t know if you can deal with Tigger all the time, but you sure don’t want to hang around Eeyore, some negative grumpy guy. You want excitement and happiness. That is the fun of coaching when guys come in and they are happy and they are excited and they want to practice and want to get better.” \nWith so many new players, there seem to be little no expectations for what the Wildcats could be capable of this season. Any predictions that are out there, don’t seem to be particularly high. \nIwundu said they know their status in the league, and it’s one that they are embracing. \n“We are the underdogs,” he said. “All year, that is what drives us to go out there and play hard and perform. Everyone takes things serious this year. There is nothing going on outside of the court or off the court. Everything is more mature.” \nGoing into last season, the Wildcats appeared to have it all, on paper, returning a roster that had helped lead them to the NCAA tournament in 2013-14. But while outside predictions were high, Weber always said he was just cautiously optimistic. Weber admits he knew his team had some problems. \n“Our ticket people don’t want me to say this, this and that because they want to sell tickets and they want people excited,” Weber said. “I was trying to tactfully use a word that kept a little bit of a damper on things.” \nWeber said his feelings on this season’s teams are different, yet he remains cautious about what they could be capable of. \n“This group, I feel good about them,” Weber said. “I think we’ll have a better team. That doesn’t mean we have more talent, but we have a group that enjoys each other and they play hard. Now, the cautious part is we have a lot of inexperience. You have to throw them into the fire and we have to have some of those young guys step up. \n“The apprehension with people is they don’t know what we have. We know a little bit, but we have to see. You have to get into some games to see what’s going on and get a feel of it”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:10:16.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
