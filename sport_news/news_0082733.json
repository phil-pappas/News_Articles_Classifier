It is, therefore, necessary that various dimensions of this situation are examined in order to reach, if possible, a consensus on this issue. To start with, let us capture the most essential points. It is alleged that the head of Dera Sacha Sauda, a sect with its headquarters in Haryana and some following in the adjoining districts of Haryana and Punjab, wore a robe at a ceremony whose purpose was to make him look like Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. The mainstream Sikh community reacted with outrage because in the Sikh imagination, no one can or should pretend to look like any of the 10 gurus. Any attempt by anyone to do so is viewed by the Sikhs as an insult to their guru and the Sikhs are willing to tolerate, in varying degrees, any disagreeable behaviour but not an insult to their guru. The Sikh outrage resulted in some violent clashes between them and the followers of Dera Sacha Sauda and led to some loss of lives on both sides. Eventually, Akal Takht intervened to issue an edict (hukamnama) for the social boycott of the Dera. The stand-off between the Sikhs and the Dera followers has remained a source of continuing instability and social friction in Punjab. This has resulted in the state's scarce financial, administrative, security and judicial resources being disproportionately diverted to dealing with the problems associated with this conflict. It has adversely affected even the religious resources of the Sikh institutions to deal with many other serious problems faced by the Sikh community within Punjab, rest of India and globally. Now the Dera chief has submitted in writing that not only he did not impersonate the Guru, he could never even think of doing so because he had great respect for the Guru. The signed declaration is accompanied by a video clip reiterating the same position. On the basis of this, the five Jathedars led by Akal Takht Jathedar have accepted this submission, pardoned the Dera chief and have withdrawn the edict about the social boycott of the Dera. There are three aspects of this decision by Akal Takht â€” the intentions/motives behind taking the decision, the process of taking the decision and the content of the decision itself. Let us discuss all of them in brief. The motive behind the decision could be the electoral compulsions of seeking votes of the Dera followers by the ruling Akali Dal party and the pressure of the ruling establishment on the Jathedaars to take this decision. If this interpretation is correct, then there seems to be some weight in the argument of the dissident Sikh organisations that the Jathedars have lowered their prestige as neutral arbiters of contentious issues in the Sikh Panth. Coming now to the process, the Jathedars seem to have taken the decision almost in secrecy, without consultation with wider sections of Sikhs religious and political organisations. A vital decision of this scale did deserve to be deliberated, if not openly in public but certainly by consultation with a wide range of opinions. Both the motive and the process, therefore, appear tainted. Now coming to the decision itself, no one who seriously wishes for the good of Punjab can emphatically deny that it is a good decision. A question might be raised that if the motive behind a decision and the process of taking the decision are tainted, can the result of that decision be good? In theory, this may seem an inconsistent combination but the real life does demonstrate that sometimes bad intentions and flawed processes can throw good results. The contrary is also true that sometimes good intentions and flawless processes can result in bad outcomes. I would give two examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Recently, the BJP-led government in Maharashtra bought a 3.1-million pound house in London, where B.R. Ambedkar had lived as a student, to convert this into an Ambedkar museum. The motive behind this government move is clearly to win over a section of the Dalits to a party that believes in caste hierarchies against which Ambedkar fought all his life. The motive is tainted but the building of an Ambedkar museum in a city as internationally important as London is a good one to spread Ambedkar's ideas for annihilation of the caste system. Another example of this nature is the UNO's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948. The motive of the US-led Western powers behind this declaration was to use this as an ideological weapon against Stalinist/communist regimes that were violating human rights. The motive was ideologically tainted but the result was a document of historic importance that is now used by human rights campaigners against America itself on issues such as the rights of the black minority in America or Guantanamo Bay prisoners. The Sikh-Dera dispute was not substantive in nature. It was essentially symbolic, though of recognised importance. It has been resolved even if not in the best possible way. The decision by the Dera to withdraw court cases against Sikh activists is a further welcome development. The Jathedars, with due humility, should take the initiative to invite activists of dissatisfied Sikh organisations for consultation and should share with them all the documentary evidence on the basis of which they took the decision to pardon the Dera chief. Not everyone would be fully satisfied and certainly not immediately because there is a genuine anger at the seemingly flawed process of reaching this decision. However, moving in the direction of consultation and consensus building or at least agreeing to disagree on some points is the only right way to proceed on this matter. If all organisations, groups and individuals rise above haumei (ego) and show nimrata (humility), as taught by the great gurus, that would help them to arrive at the correct conclusions. Finally, I want to conclude by a shabad by Guru Arjan Dev: Bisar gai sabh taat parai Jab te sadh sangat mohi pai Na ko bairi nahin bigana Sagal sang hum ko ban ai (Shri Guru Granth Sahib, page 1299) The writer is a Professor of Economics at Oxford Brookes University, UK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:14:03.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
