We came out with good pitching, good hitting and good defense,” Kirksville coach Samantha Schottel said. Duvall picked up a complete-game victory and also went 2-for-4 at the plate with two doubles. Lauren Houston went 3-for-4 and had two stolen bases. Gabriella Abreo had three RBIs, while Annelise Billington, Annabel Zimmer and Shelby VanSickel had two RBIs each. Kirksville will play Macon for a chance to play for the district championship. It will be the first time Kirksville and Macon have met this season and the No. 1 seeded Tigerettes are waiting for the Lady Tigers. “We’re waiting for them, too. We haven’t seen Macon this year like we most of the teams we’ve seen in conference play. We’re going to play loud, fun and aggressive softball,” Schottel said.
