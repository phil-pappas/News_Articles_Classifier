I think the rest of the country looks at that and says it’s an anomaly.”\nThat, of course, was Michigan State beating Michigan 27-23 Saturday on the game’s final play.\nMillen isn’t the only national analyst to downgrade Michigan State’s victory. Joel Klatt of Fox Sports moved the Spartans to 10th from seventh on his weekly Associated Press ballot. When asked why on Twitter, he responded: “Let’s be honest. Michigan State lost in voters’ minds.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:52:29.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
