The 2010 team was eliminated by state runner-up Brebeuf 4-1 in the state semifinals. Last year, Jasper edged the Red Devils 3-2 in the state quarterfinal. \nThis year seems to be different. \nThis year the Red Devils fully expect to hold the state championship trophy early Saturday evening. \n“I’ve probably had five coaches text me and tell me we have a shot,” Jeff coach Mark Reilly said. “They’ve seen us play and they’ve told me they believe we can win.” \n“I do believe that we are a contender,” senior Kooper Falkenstein said. “I know there are a lot of good teams out there, but I do think we’re in the running, for sure.” \nThe Devils hope last year’s experience of last season’s loss to Jasper, which came down to a three-setter at No. 1 singles with a cramp-riddled Austin Hunt falling short, is an advantage entering today’s quarterfinal match with the Eagles. \n“That was the first time any of us had been up to state,” senior Jack Reilly explained. “This year we’re more veteran and I think we’ll deal with our nerves better.” \n“I use it as a positive,” Falkenstein said. “It gives us motivation to never feel that same way again. It gives us the motivation to win. Hopefully I never lose another high school match.” \nJeff enters the finals with the state’s best record. It is 21-0 and one of two unbeaten teams in Indiana. \n“It does give us confidence,” Falkenstein said. “It also puts a target on our back. We’re used to having a target on our back. Everyone’s been aiming for us around here locally, so I don’t think this should be anything too different.” \nThe Devils say Mark Reilly, who has 602 combined career wins between boys’ and girls’ tennis, deserves the credit for their third trip to the state finals in six years. \n“It shows how good of a coach Reilly is,” Jeff senior and No. 1 singles player Brock Winchell said. \n“It definitely shows that Coach has put in time and has definitely worked with us to get us to this point and we’re ready for it,” said Jack Reilly, the coach’s son. \nThe Red Devils open the state tournament today against No. 20 Culver Academy (17-2). Jeff is a prohibitive favorite to advance to Saturday’s state semifinal. \n“Our team feels really good about beating Culver,” Coach Reilly said. “We feel confident that if we play well, we’ll beat Culver and have a chance to get to the [state semifinal].” \nThe current players said it would be an honor to at least tie the 2010 team with the program’s best finish of a Final Four appearance. \n“It gives me chills just thinking about it,” Falkenstein said. “To blaze a new trails and even go further than any other Jeff team would just be an honor.” \nWith a win, Jeff would face either No. 1 Carmel (17-1) or No. 2 North Central (18-0), which have combined to win the last five state titles and have 27 title between them. Reilly know his Devils will be slight underdog against the Greyhounds or Panthers, but he also expects his squad to come out on top. \n“Definitely if we could take out one of those, we’d reach goals we never really dreamed about when I first started coaching here,” Coach Reilly said. \nComparing results, particularly those against No. 5 Guerin Catholic, the Red Devils stack up well with the No. 1 Greyhounds. \n“We can win at all three singles and our No. 1 doubles team is as good as anyone in the state,” Winchell said. \nWhat makes the Devils dangerous is their depth. Falkenstein is unbeaten at No. 2 singles, Bradley Cross is 21-1 at No. 3 singles, Jeff’s No. 1 doubles team of Reilly and Sam Coward enters state at 20-2 and Blake Winchell and Keith Asplund are 22-4 at No. 2 doubles. \n“I think it definitely gives us a confidence boost that every position at least has a chance probably against anyone in the state,” Falkenstein said. \n“That takes a lot of pressure of me,” Winchell said. “If I’m losing, they can still win the match. It makes me play better in my match because it takes the pressure off.” \nNo matter what happens this weekend, Mark Reilly’s has cemented his program as one of the state’s premier programs with three recent treks to state. \n“I think it gives respect for tennis in the community,” Coach Reilly said. “Everybody’s been saying, ‘Good job, congratulations.’ Kids in the lower grades, maybe when they come up to Jeff High, it will be something they want to do. We love basketball and football, but we need good athletes in tennis. If they see these guys do it, they think maybe I can do the same thing.” \n“I think it speaks volumes about the program and Coach Reilly and the time and effort everyone has put in,” Falkenstein said. “I think Jeff tennis is definitely on the right track to be a contender every year.” \n2015 STATE FINALS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:37:34.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
