National Tennis Center for damages related to the head injury she sustained after falling on a tile floor in a physical therapy room on Sept. 4.\nIn the suit, which was filed Wednesday in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Bouchard said that the fall was the result of “a slippery, foreign and dangerous substance on the floor” that had been caused by the tournament and that the tournament had failed to give her any warning about the condition.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Eugenie Bouchard Withdraws From U.S. Open SEPT. 6, 2015 Bouchard, a 21-year-old Canadian, was a breakout star in 2014, reaching the final of Wimbledon and the semifinals of the Australian Open and the French Open . She was in the midst of an apparent resurgence at the U.S. Open after a disappointing season but withdrew from the tournament before her fourth-round match as a result of a concussion and other symptoms related to the fall.\n“In line with our policy, the U.S.T.A. will not be commenting on ongoing litigation,” said Chris Widmaier, managing director of corporate communications for the U.S.T.A.\nBouchard is still troubled by the injury. She had to withdraw from a tournament two weeks ago in Wuhan, China, and retired midway through her first-round match last week in Beijing, citing dizziness. She has also withdrawn from events in Hong Kong and Tokyo.\nThe lawsuit notes that Bouchard’s ranking, which peaked at No. 5 last year, continues to drop. She is now No. 39 in the world, but was No. 25 at the time of the accident.\nBouchard is asking for a jury trial and is seeking damages of more than $150,000. “For sure,” said her lawyer, Benedict Morelli, “we could be talking about millions and millions.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://a1.nyt.com/assets/article/20151014-102019/images/foundation/logos/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/07/sports/07bouchard/07bouchard-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:43:59.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
