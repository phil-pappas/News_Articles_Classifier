Running about 35 kms every day, the 46-year-old, mother of two from Pune, is expected to complete the run in 171 stages spread over 187 days. She will have 16 days of rest during the entire period and will be doing the equivalent of running 143 full marathons.\nTo encourage first timers to take up running, she plans to have 'Run with Michelle – 5K' runs in the 14 metros that she will pass through — Surat, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Kanpur, Varanasi, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Vishakapatnam, Vijaywada, Chennai, Bangalore, Satara, Pune and Mumbai.\nMichelle, who became the only Indian to complete the four Desert Challenge in 2012, wants to dedicate her run to the women who are battling survival due to their gender.\n\"Women in our country are struggling to survive with respect and dignity purely because of gender inequality. Hence, I dedicate this run to them. In all the earlier marathons that I have participated, I had fellow runners whose stories used to inspire me,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:58:03.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
