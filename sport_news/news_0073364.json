You have only one day to prepare and you play away from home against a good team that was very solid at home in their previous games,\" he said. \n\"We knew it was going to be a difficult game, so we needed to be patient.\" \nCech added: \"We had a really big game against Manchester United last week before the internationals, so when you win those games (you have to) win another game. \n\"We treat everybody with the same respect, so the three points are vital for us.\" \nWatford manager Quique Sanchez Flores had again set his side up to be hard to break down, a trend which has served them well at home this season since returning to the top flight. \nBut despite all of their endeavour - with former Tottenham midfielder Etienne Capoue and captain Troy Deeney leading the charge - the Hornets lacked real sting in the final third. \nDeeney's raw power caused the Arsenal centre-backs plenty of problems, and the forward believes focusing on the positives of what was a largely industrious display will be key for the challenges ahead. \n\"It was a harsh lesson in what the Premier League big boys are all about,\" Deeney said on Hornets PlayerHD. \n\"We were good for 65 minutes, more than held our own and created a lot of chances, but one counter-attack and that is the difference.\" \nDeeney added: \"But let's be realistic, we have just come into the Premier League, we are not expected to just go and beat Arsenal. \n\"However, we gave the fans something to cheer about and showed what we can do, so the challenge for us now is to make that 65 minutes last 90 minutes against Stoke away (next week).\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:22:32.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
