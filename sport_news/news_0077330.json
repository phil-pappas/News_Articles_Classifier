There's a great offer for Spurs Nation magazine here. \n“I just threw the puck to the net and it went in,” said Rantanen, the draft’s top-rated European prospect who played three seasons in the Finnish pro league. “I wasn’t nervous. I’m glad I’m here. I just wanted to play.” \nThe 6-foot-4, 211-pound forward started the season with the parent Avalanche, but was sent down to get playing time. \nHe averaged just 9:12 in his six games with Colorado. \n“He was good enough to play with us,” Avalanche GM Joe Sakic said before the game. “But as an 18-year-old, you need to play. Coming down here, he’s going to get that opportunity.” \n“The kid can play,” Rampage coach Dean Chynoweth said. “There’s a reason why he was a first-round pick.” \nThe Rampage (3-0-1-0) never trailed. They were without leading scorer Andrew Agozzino , out with an upper body injury. \nBut Rantanen and Bigras more than made up for his absence. Patrick Bordeleau made it three Rampage players with multi-point nights with two assists. \nBigras, 20, said it was a night he’ll never forget. His goal came at 12:16 of the second period. \n“That puck’s going to be hanging in a room somewhere when I’m older,” he said. \nSam Henley , Colin Smith and Marc Andre Cliché also scored for the Rampage, who don’t play again until next Friday. \n“I liked our start,” Chynoweth said. “With the delay in the game the guys were down here early. We were preparing for two weeks for potential bad ice. \n“I really liked our defense tonight. We got each line involved in the scoring and didn’t need our power play tonight.” \nGoaltender Calvin Pickard lost his bid for a second straight shutout when Freddie Hamilton scored Stockton’s lone goal at 10:03 of the third. \nIt ended Pickard’s streak of six straight scoreless periods (144 minutes, 22 seconds overall).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:46:44.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
