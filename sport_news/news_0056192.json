Advertisement Brook has sights on playoffs By Ted Dunnam Houston Community Newspapers \nIt’s not likely you’ll find too many teams looking forward to week seven of the season after an 0-5 start, but that’s exactly the case with the Clear Brook football team. \nThe Wolverines have concluded the first half of their schedule having played teams with a combined 24-2 record, and three of those foes remain unbeaten. \n“I’m still planning on being in the playoffs,” Clear Brook head coach Mike Allison said. “My expectations haven’t changed. \n“If we continue to get better each week, we’ll get in. It’s just a matter of staying healthy, and we’ll continue to coach hard and play hard.” \nThe Wolverines (0-5, 0-2 in District 24-6A) take on Clear Lake (1-4, 0-2) at 7 p.m., Friday in League City’s Veterans Memorial Stadium. \nBrook enters the game off a 42-28 loss to powerful Dickinson, but the Wolverines led the Gators 21-20 at halftime. \n“We’re 0-2 in district, and we’ve played the two best teams in district according to what most of the newspapers and rankings say,” Allison said. “Coach (Darrell) Warden (Clear Creek) and coach (John) Snelson (Dickinson) do an outstanding job with their teams. \n“They play hard, they play well and they play physical. But I’m proud of our kids because we played with both of those teams. \n“There’s no quit in our kids. If we can play two halves the way we played the first half of those games, they’d have been even closer.” \nClear Lake has played a schedule similar to Brook’s, having lost to Port Neches-Groves and Nederland while also falling to Dickinson. The Falcons, too, dropped a 51-7 decision this past weekend to Clear Springs, which is a projected playoff team. \n“Clear Lake does a good job changing the tempo of the game,” Allison said. “Coach (Sam) Smith’s son is at quarterback, and anytime you have a coach’s kid at quarterback they seem to have a better understanding of the game. \n“They’ve been around football all their life, they talk football at the dinner table, and they watch football after homework.” \nThe game is pretty much a must-win for either team if playoff aspirations are to remain. \n“Lake’s had a tough season with a couple of injuries here lately, but you still have to get out there and play,” said Allison, Brook’s first-year coach. \n“They’re kind of in the same boat as us, but the difference is they have a win and we don’t. They’re one up on us as far as I’m concerned.” \nEven though his team is riding a five-game losing streak, Allison says his team sees the light at the end of the tunnel. \n“They’re starting to believe in themselves,” Allison said. “After the Dickinson game, the look in our kids’ eyes was different in a positive way. \n“From game to game, they’re starting to feel more confident in the changes that have been made.” \nBrook has also had a few injuries that have resulted in slot receiver Brandon Taylor assuming the quarterback duties and Jacob Alfano moving from tackle to center. \n“We’ve had some kids go down, but somebody seems to step up and accept the challenge,” Allison said. “All those things will make us better. \n“I told our kids those first five games will make us better men later in life. We continue to fight and to improve.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:19:43.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
