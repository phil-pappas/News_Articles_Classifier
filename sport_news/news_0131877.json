Casey calls him “the best driver in the league at his position” but finding the patience to wait for his chance and to not attempt to dominate games on his own when he plays is the secret.\n“He understands what his role is and what’s being asked of him,” Casey said. “The key is his fight for consistency . . . be positive and embrace the role.\n“There are a lot of guys in the league who’ve been in the league a long, long time who embrace that role, and there’s a lot of guys who don’t make it in the league because they don’t embrace that role.\n“He’s got an opportunity to embrace that role.”\nJohnson always has come across publicly as someone who knows the reality and is willing to accept it. He talked Saturday about the difficulty of learning the nuances of playing two different positions — how to set up defenders with screens on offence, how to force opponents to their weaknesses rather than their strengths as a defender — but also how his game and body are perfectly suited for today’s style of play.\n“It’s just learning the plays that’s really hard from the four to the five and the three, but it’s fun though,” he said.\n“In this day and age, there really are no numbers when you go small, everyone’s just out there. The fives could be the twos or the threes, the fours could be the twos or the ones these days. The game is evolving, and it’s nice.”\nThe undeniable fact is Johnson has the capability to do it, as long as the mental aspect of the game doesn’t get to him. He may never be an all-star — his jump shot needs improvement, the rogue nature of his play sometimes irks coaches and teammates, but being prepared in both aspects will help him.\n“The key for James is keeping his head up, making sure he stays positive, stays ready no matter what happens,” Casey said.\nMore on thestar.com\nChelsea, Manchester United return to winning ways\nIt’s time to win, say Blue Jays fans ahead of ALCS Game 2 against Royals", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:07:26.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
