Not-exactly-a-bold-prediction alert: the Knicks will be better.\nWhen you’re stacking up against 17 wins, it’s simple deduction. But we also find it telling that the Knicks don’t want to set the bar at the playoffs, even after drafting two first-round picks and giving out roughly $100 million in guaranteed contracts over the summer.\n“The Eastern Conference is better than people think,” coach Derek Fisher said.\nThis is the recovery year, after all, following the binge misery of 2014-15. It’s the test of Carmelo Anthony’s patience. It’s the trial of Derek Fisher. It’s the development of Kristaps Porzingis. It’s Jim Dolan’s intervention from wild spending and quick fixes.\nForgetting about the triangle – which remains dear to Phil Jackson’s heart – the Knicks are now made up of solid yet unspectacular players. And here’s a breakdown of the positions:\nPOINT GUARD\nJose Calderon, one of the nicest and most intelligent guys you’ll find in the NBA, was recently reminded by a reporter that, verbatim, “You’re no spring chicken.” Never mind that Calderon is more familiar with pork as the owner of an organic pig farm in Spain (he only feeds them acorns!), the assessment is applicable for a 34-year-old entering his 17th year as a pro. How much remains in the tank? You have to believe Calderon is refreshed following last season’s disappointing and injury-plagued inaugural campaign in New York. The calf strain that started in preseason never fully healed, and Calderon managed to play just 42 ineffective games. This is a redemption tour of sorts, but don’t expect miracles. Even at his best — during those spring chicken days — Calderon couldn’t get past the first round of the playoffs.\n“I don’t know what people were expecting last season,” he said. “Maybe they were expecting an All-Star season. I’m not that kind of player, but I’ll help my team better this year.” He can shoot. He’s a smart playmaker. But can he physically keep up with these point guards? There are two youngsters who are coming off New York’s bench (Langston Galloway and Jerian Grant) who are more athletic at point guard, but certainly less savvy and experienced than Calderon.\nSHOOTING GUARD\nSteve Freeman/NBAE/Getty Images While older, veteran Jose Calderon is looking a lot healthier this time around after an injury-plagued first season with the Knicks. You hear it every time the injury pops up (pun intended): hamstrings are tricky. Arron Afflalo is now faced with a tricky hamstring strain, one that was originally supposed to keep him out just one practice, then kept him out for all of training camp, and then was re-aggravated Thursday. When he’s healthy — and the Knicks have not provided a timetable — Afflalo is the starting shooting guard. He’s also probably New York’s second best scorer behind Carmelo Anthony, which, let’s face it, is not what Phil Jackson was selling the fan base with his 2015 cap space.\nSix seasons ago, Anthony was the leading scorer on the Denver Nuggets and Afflalo ranked sixth on that team. But the 30-year-old has improved and gained confidence with age, to the point that he earned a two-year, $16 million contract to again serve as Anthony’s running mate. Only two seasons ago he averaged 18.2 points with the Orlando Magic and was being mentioned as a potential All-Star reserve. He’s not going to blow you away with athleticism or defense, but he’s a substantial scorer on a lineup that needs his perimeter threat. He’s the NBA’s dictionary definition of a solid player... so long as that tricky hamstring is healthy. If not, we’re probably looking at Sasha Vujacic at this position. And he was out of the NBA the last three years.\nSMALL FORWARD\nCarmelo Anthony says he doesn’t have to prove anything, and we respectfully disagree (we also believe Anthony is trying to trick himself into believing that). Because every 31-year-old coming off knee surgery has something to prove, even if they’re one of the best offensive players in the league.\nThe load isn’t light on this team, either. Anthony was hoping for an All-Star teammate to share his New York burden, but Phil Jackson went in a different direction — one that will again place the onus on No. 7 to make or break the season. In other words, prepare for more iso-Melo when the shot clock gets low. And that’s why we anticipate one of two things: Anthony is rejuvenated and leading a Knicks surge, or he’s miserably walking back on defense amidst losing and waiting for the trade deadline. The Knicks’ future is a few years away. Anthony’s future is now.\nPOWER FORWARD\nKristaps Porzingis looks even younger than he is. If he can grow facial hair (we’re pretty sure he can’t), he must shave it every hour and apply baby lotion. In other words, he’s a kid amongst men with Wolverine beards like Kyle O’Quinn. So there will be growing pains for the 20-year-old. Lots of them. If Porzingis can remain healthy and out of foul trouble, Knicks fans will be treated to a smooth scorer with the requisite confidence for a star. The franchise is doubling down on the Latvian by handing him the starting spot, despite the uneven preseason. He’s Phil Jackson’s guy, the reward for a 65-loss season.\nHow much are the Knicks committed to his development? They told free agent LaMarcus Aldridge, a four-time All-Star, that he’d have to play center to accommodate Porzingis. The rookie demonstrated flashes in preseason of being a capable rebounder, but that remains to be seen. O’Quinn and Derrick Williams are the backups.\nSteve Freeman/NBAE/Getty Images The Knicks spend big money to bring in Robin Lopez at center. CENTER\nConsidering how much money was getting tossed around in free agency and the upcoming $24 billion television deal that will change the landscape of the NBA, maybe giving $54 million to Robin Lopez isn’t so crazy. Maybe he’ll be the defensive anchor the Knicks desperately need to compensate for Melo’s weaknesses on that end, and maybe he’ll develop into an important piece of Phil Jackson’s triangle. But it’s a big commitment to a 27-year-old with career averages of 8.2 points and 5.0 rebounds. And it’s a risk on “intangibles” that Jackson can’t afford to get wrong. Lopez struggled in preseason but revealed that he’s been managing an injury. The Knicks signed Kevin Seraphin to serve as the reserve center, if Porzingis isn’t moving over to fill the position.\nCOACHING\nAn identity is important for a coach, and quite frankly, Derek Fisher doesn’t have one. Not a good one, anyway. He’s not the hard-nosed guy. He’s not the philosopher. He’s not the expert tactician. He’s not the hot-tempered complainer. He’s not the offensive guru, or the defensive specialist. Right now, when you think of Derek Fisher as a coach, you think of the following: Phil Jackson, 65 losses, Matt Barnes. If we were playing $25,000 Pyramid, those three clues would do the trick. Fisher’s been handed a better roster this season and, although outside expectations are low, he’s going to have to induce marked improvement from a 17-65 inaugural season. Fisher has a lot to prove, perhaps more than anybody in the organization.\nFRONT OFFICE\nPhil Jackson acknowledged that last season was “a project gone awry,” but there was an excuse: the players were inherited. These 2015-16 Knicks are his guys, though, “a group that’s kind of been hand-picked,” he said. So maybe now we can accurately grade Jackson as a team president, because we’re guessing he’d prefer last season to be judged simply as a trial run. There’s no draft pick to act as a parachute if things go awry again (that pick was traded two years ago for the gift that keeps on giving, Andrea Bargnani). So Jackson can’t just wave a white flag again if the project goes awry. This summer he started a process of building, rather than tearing down.\nROSTER\n1 Kevin Seraphin F 6-10\n2 Langston Galloway G 6-2\n3 Jose Calderon G 6-3\n4 Arron Afflalo G 6-5\n6 Kristaps Porzingis F-C 7-3\n7 Carmelo Anthony F 6-8\n8 Robin Lopez C 7-0\n9 Kyle O’Quinn F-C 6-10\n11 Cleanthony Early F 6-8\n13 Jerian Grant G 6-4\n17 Lou Amundson F 6-9\n18 Sasha Vujacic G 6-7\n23 Derrick Williams F 6-8\n42 Lance Thomas F 6-8\nRelated Stories Knicks relying on healthy Carmelo Anthony Five burning questions for Knicks Knicks' five key games to watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:59:42.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
