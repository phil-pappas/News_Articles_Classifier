They packed up the night with a round of fun, donning massars - the traditional Omani head gear - and having halwa (Omani sweet) and kahwa (local coffee). \nIt was a ceremony that many of the windsurfers called 'unique' and a 'memorable experience' that provided a glimpse of the country's culture with Oman Sail making all efforts to showcase Omani hospitality to the top officials of the RS:X class and the sailors. \nH E Sheikh Saad al Saadi, the Minister of Sports Affairs, accompanied by H E Maitha al Mahrouqi, the chairwoman of Oman Sail, along with others top officials were present at the ceremony. \nSpeaking to Muscat Daily, H E Saadi said, “It is an honour for Oman to host the fourth world championships in sailing. We had successfully organised three laser world events in 2013. \nThe event will put Oman in the spotlight across the world and we are happy to have it here.”Oman Sail CEO David Graham said, “Sport has the power to unite people and cultures. \nSailing has brought new people to Oman from around the world; some for the first time. We hope they carry good memories and become ambassadors of Oman.” \nSpeaking on the occasion, Carlo Dalla Vedova, RS:X class president, presented two golden pins to Neil Pryde, designer of the RS:X sailboard, and H E Maitha, the Undersecretary at the Ministry of Tourism, in appreciation of their support. \nA delighted H E Maitha said, “It is a great honour to host the world championships. The event has added great value to Oman Sail's organisational abilities as we won the bidding after a lengthy process. We offered the best to win the rights to host it.” \nRashid al Kindi, the head of the organising committee and the chairman of the Oman Sailing Committee, was upbeat and said the hosting of the world championships will boost the interest in the sport in Oman. \n“It gives us an opportunity to inspire the next generation of windsurfers and create a legacy for Oman’s own participation. Oman Sail’s windsurfing club already has few members aged between 12-15 years. \n“Our goal is to train a squad to be capable of representing Oman at top-level events, including Olympic Games. With the continued support of the Ministry of Sports Affairs, we are hopeful of achieving our goal.” Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:49:17.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
