On Tuesday, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said all the right things about Ramirez as the team’s first baseman in 2016. “We need to do everything we can to make that work,” Dombrowski said. “We’re committed to it. I believe he’s committed to it. His representatives are committed to making it work. Will it work? Time will tell.” That’s what you would expect Dombrowski and the Red Sox to say at this point. Expressing any more uncertainty regarding Ramirez would reduce Boston’s already minuscule leverage in any trade conversations about the expensive slugger to nothing. At the same time, the best possible Red Sox team in 2016 probably has Ramirez as its first baseman. His offensive potential exceeds that of any free agent at the position, save for Chris Davis – and Boston isn’t about to eat a sizable portion of Ramirez’s contract in a trade and then shell out more cash for Davis. If Ramirez can handle first and if he rediscovers his usual offensive self, the Red Sox will have their best-case scenario. But there are plenty of reasons to doubt Boston’s sincerity regarding Ramirez, not the least of which is the fact that the Sox couldn’t find time to experiment with him at first down the stretch of the season. The coaching staff was quick to acknowledge – as Dombrowski was Tuesday – that the team has no idea whether Ramirez can actually learn first base next spring. “I guess I’m cautiously optimistic,” third base coach Brian Butterfield said the last week of the season. “There’s a lot in front of him. We don’t know. We don’t know for sure. But we’re hopeful.” Cautious optimism is how the Red Sox should feel about the futures of their young players. It shouldn’t be the most apt description for their prize free agent from a year ago trying to learn his second new position in as many years – because the first transition failed so abjectly. That’s why it’s hard to put faith in Ramirez: If he couldn’t learn left field in a winter, why would he be able to learn a more difficult position this winter? First base is definitely a more difficult defensive spot than left field, and it’s one where the slightest deficiencies get exposed quickly. “You want to have someone over there that’s pretty athletic. If you have a guy that’s good over there, it gives your other infielders confidence to make the throw,” said Brock Holt, who also spoke about the time needed to learn the footwork at first. “Whenever we had (Mike Napoli), we could just chuck it over there and know he was going to make the play. It gives you a lot of confidence.” Page 2 of 3 - Ramirez played left field for the Red Sox for five months; if he’s as bad at first as he was in left, he might not last five games there. The unexpected late-season emergence of Travis Shaw gives the Red Sox some “protection” at first, to steal the word Dombrowski used Tuesday. Should Ramirez falter in the spring or early next season, Shaw could step in and, hopefully, hold his own offensively at the spot. That would still leave the Red Sox the unsavory business of having $66 million tied into a pinch-hitter and spot starter at designated hitter, at least until Boston deemed it necessary to eat all the money and move on. They also wouldn’t have the opportunity to protect Shaw with a right-handed bat via free agency – a guy like Napoli or Steve Pearce – if they go into the season with Ramirez still on the roster. Dombrowski on Tuesday also mentioned Sam Travis – the organization’s offensive player of the year who finished 2015 at Double-A Portland – as a promising young first baseman in the pipeline. A major-league cameo for Travis in 2016 isn’t unforeseeable, but it would be aggressive and, one would think, less than ideal. What would be better for the Red Sox is a trade that moves Ramirez this winter and opens up some roster and financial flexibility. But while baseball’s recent past has suggested that no contract is unmovable – Vernon Wells, Carl Crawford, Prince Fielder and Josh Hamilton all changed teams while possessing some of the worst deals in the sport – Ramirez presents a particularly intractable dilemma. His defensive woes limit his market significantly, as he can pretty much only be considered a designated hitter at this point, and there are very few teams with openings at that spot. The only teams with what you’d consider vacancies at DH are the Orioles, Rays, Indians and possibly Twins, depending on where they want to put Miguel Sano. Taking on Ramirez’s deal doesn’t really mesh with the philosophy of Tampa Bay, Cleveland or Minnesota, meaning Baltimore is just about the only team that might have legitimate interest in Ramirez. The O’s don’t have an equally onerous contract to help balance out such a trade, so the Sox would probably have to eat about $25 million to $30 million of the $66 million remaining on Ramirez’s contract to make it work. (It’s tough to envision Ramirez as a free agent earning more than about a three-year deal worth much more than about $36 million considering the season he just had.) And at that point, the idea of a player you’re paying mashing against you in your own division – the way Hamilton did for the Rangers against the Angels down the stretch – probably makes the Red Sox cringe. There’s a point at which trading Ramirez for cents on the dollar doesn’t make sense for Boston.

It remains the toughest question to answer for Boston. Follow Tim Britton on Twitter @TimBritton.
