It is not easy. \n\"The only negatives is that we lost some players through in jury during the week, but I will have to rest some players Tuesday night against Sheffield (Wednesday in the Capital One Cup) as I think for some players I think it will be one game too many for them.\" \nWenger admitted he did not expect Arsenal to be at the head of the table at this stage following their poor start. \n\"I thought after 10 games, no, honestly. I thought it would take much longer because Manchester City started with five wins, so it was difficult to envisage that we would come back but we had no choice,\" said Wenger. \n\"But we are there, that shows we have made some ground up, so let's keep our togetherness and fight for the future games, that is all we can do. \n\"It is very early in the season but we are happy to be where we are.\" \nEverton boss Roberto Martinez, whose side were beaten 3-0 by Manchester United last weekend, believes the Gunners will have a big part to play in this season's title race. \n\"Arsenal is in very good form and if you allow them to do what they are good at they will stand out in the competition, but I don't think it is going to be decided yet in October,\" he said. \n\"The season is very long, it is very demanding. We have got very good teams and probably it is going to go down to the very last game.\" \nEngland defender Jagielka, meanwhile, will undergo tests to determine the extent of the damage. \n\"It will take probably 48 hours to find out the damage, but it's not good,\" said Martinez. \n\"We do not know at this point the extent but the structure we know is going to be damaged. To lose Jagielka in such a stupid challenge, an unnecessary challenge is frustrating.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:22:24.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
