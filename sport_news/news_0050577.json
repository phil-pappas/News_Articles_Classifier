Ross McCormack, Dembele and Alex Kacaniklic all struck during the purple patch.Symons was able to breathe easy once Dembele - fresh from signing a long-term deal - sealed the unlikely win.Reading are among the Sky Bet Championship's top scorers and it took them just 13 minutes to draw first blood following a sweeping move.Matej Vydra's final defence-splitting, first-time pass freed Piazon and the on-loan Chelsea midfielder calmly stroked the ball home.It was the worst possible start for Symons, who knew he needed to get the home supporters back on side.But Fulham appeared low on confidence, in contrast to Reading whose intricate passing was catching the eye.Another fluid move saw Piazon once again find himself within sight of goal but Richard Stearman's outstretched leg deflected the ball just over the top of the crossbar.Fulham finally threatened in the 38th minute, which was greeted with ironic cheers, when Dembele headed over.Symons knew his side needed to up their tempo after the break but instead it was Sa who struck for the Royals in the 49th minute.The Portuguese striker, who endured a miserable stint with Fulham three years ago, fared better here as he pounced on Tom Cairney's mistake before firing home from the angle.Fulham were staring down the barrel but within a minute McCormack had thrown them a lifeline. The Cottagers captain flicked the ball up and shot on the turn to rock Reading.And the hosts, from looking dead and buried, were at it again when Dembele turned home Lasse Vigen Christensen's cross.Nobody could have predicted the dramatic turnaround. Two minutes later the whole game had been turned on its head when substitute Kacaniklic netted.Dembele's cushioned lay-off exposed the visitors' defence and the Swede slotted past a shell-shocked Ali Al Habsi.Reading had failed to halt the onslaught but they had shown enough going forward to suggest this was not the end of the scoring.Their third almost arrived when the in-form Nick Blackman's corner was met by Sa but Ryan Fredericks hacked the header off his own line.It proved crucial as Fulham would go up the other end to score again via Dembele.McCormack's clever flick freed the Frenchman who beat the helpless Al Habsi for a fourth time in the half.The Scot was denied another goal late on when Chris Gunter cleared off the line, but the damage had already been done.
