Alec Robillard came through with a 6-1, 7-5 victory at No. 1 singles, while Jacob Brewer and Matt Hapner prevailed 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 at No. 1 doubles. \n“The kids had to come through under pressure,” Cleland said. “Lapel is a really good team, but the pressure is on our backs. We’re sort of expected to win being the higher-ranked team. It’s a special kind of pressure. You get in that situation, you have to come through, and they did. As a team, it was one of our better matches. We’ve had some good matches, but that was one of our better ones.” \nThe Eagles are certainly used to being in this position, but Lapel certainly didn’t make it easy. Brewer and Hapner trailed 3-0 in the first set but rallied. Robillard beat Garrett Fensler, who Cleland called “an All-State level player,” to earn his 20th victory of the season. Wegener, meanwhile, has lost only one game in four matches in the postseason. \nUp next for the Eagles is a familiar foe in North Central (17-0), which defeated the Eagles last season in the state semifinals and eventually won a state championship. Cleland said North Central has three players back from that squad. Delta is vying to reach the state finals for the third straight season, which would be the first time in school history. \n“Obviously it’s a very difficult hill to climb, but our guys will be ready to give it a go on Saturday noon,” Cleland said. \n“We have to go through a Goliath, but we’ve played a tough schedule. Only eight teams have ever gone to state finals three years in a row; we’d like to be the ninth. We’ve got our work cut out for us.” 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1RuCOmU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:33:01.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
