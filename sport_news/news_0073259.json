Several Warriors converged. \nMost quarterbacks would’ve accepted a 6-yard loss. \nInstead, Lyndhurst’s Guerriero wiggled loose and ran 12 more yards in the wrong direction to escape six Warriors. Once a small opening developed, Guerriero turned around, eluded three more Warriors, and raced down Lyndhurst’s sideline for a 33-yard touchdown. \nAs spectacular as Guerriero’s highlight-reel run was last month in the Golden Bears’ opener, it was just a preview of what was to come during his special senior season. \nGuerriero’s gift for turning nothing into something has made him one of New Jersey’s most dynamic, productive players. The determined leader of Lyndhurst’s read-option offense has rushed for at least 265 yards in each of the Golden Bears’ past four games, including a career-high 331 yards and four touchdowns on 25 carries during a 42-35 loss Saturday at Glen Rock. \nThe 5-foot-11, 175-pound Guerriero has gained 1,197 rushing yards in those four games, which would project to an astounding 3,591 yards over the course of a 12-game season. Through six games, Guerriero has produced 1,394 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns on just 131 carries, good for 10.6 yards per carry. \n\"He’s probably the most elusive, explosive player we’ve ever coached against,\" said Jim Kurz, Glen Rock’s seventh-year coach and a 14-year member of the Panthers’ staff. \"I think his ability to take a broken play and turn it into a big play is what scares you the most. \n\"He can go back to pass, there’s nothing really there, and then all of a sudden he just wiggles his way around and just takes off. His explosiveness is unbelievable. He’ll just find a lane, and it’s like he’s shot out of a cannon. He’s running down the field and players are running after him, but it’s too late at that point.\" \nEight of Guerriero’s 14 touchdowns during this fantastic, four-game stretch have gone for at least 42 yards. \nHis three touchdowns Oct. 9 in a 30-21 upset of Garfield (5-1), then ranked No. 10 in The Record Public Top 20, went for 43, 62 and 85 yards. Guerriero’s final three touchdowns against 12th-ranked Glen Rock (5-1) accounted for 60, 52 and 84 yards. \n\"He’s the best athlete I’ve ever been around, hands down,\" said Matt DeMarco, Lyndhurst’s senior running back/linebacker. \"Some of the plays he makes are just unbelievable. He’s in a pile, and then you see him spurt out, and it’s an 85-yard touchdown. Once he’s in the open field, he’s gone. No one’s catching him.\" \nGuerriero is proud of his production and an offensive line that includes senior left tackle Michael Cooper, senior center Michael Fata, senior right guard Oluwayomi Olasehinde, junior left guard Matt Schnoll and senior right tackle Ryan Smith. He’s most concerned, however, with winning the Golden Bears’ final two games before the cutoff to qualify for the North 2, Group 2 playoffs. \nLyndhurst (2-4) went 1-9 last season, Guerriero’s first in the program after moving from North Arlington and transferring from St. Mary. If the Golden Bears beat Immaculate of Montclair (1-5) tonight and Pompton Lakes (3-2) on Oct. 30, they’ll likely reach the playoffs for the first time since 2011. \n\"A lot of people didn’t believe in us,\" said Guerriero, an outside linebacker who leads Lyndhurst with 47 tackles. \"But everybody on the team knew that if we play how we play and we practice hard each day, we can make the playoffs this year. It’d be awesome to make it.\" \nMeanwhile, Guerriero is making an impression on college coaches. \nRecruiters from FCS schools Sacred Heart (Conn.) and Central Connecticut State, and Division II Assumption (Mass.) have expressed the most interest. Sacred Heart’s staff likes Guerriero as a cornerback, although he’d prefer to play running back in college. \nLyndhurst coach Rich Tuero is certain Guerriero could be a scholarship punter if he wasn’t capable of playing numerous positions. \nGuerriero averaged 41.3 yards per punt during his junior season, for which he earned second-team All-North Jersey recognition from The Record. He also rushed for 1,652 yards and 15 touchdowns on 155 carries last season, his first as a quarterback at any level. \n\"Petey gained so much more knowledge of the game, just from one year as a quarterback,\" Tuero said. \"Coming into this season, you could tell how much more aware he is. He’s throwing the ball much better this year [24-of-48]. And obviously he’s hitting the holes and understanding the offense very well. He’s been incredible.\" \nEmail: idec@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:59:32.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
