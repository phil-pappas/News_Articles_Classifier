In her directorial debut of boyfriend Joe Jonas' new music video for \"Cake By the Ocean,\" she takes the name of the song literally and in turn has us dreaming of cake and the ocean together like never before.\nThe musician, who is now a member of DNCE, told PEOPLE that Gigi came up with the concept for the video and when presented with the idea of directing the project, she ran with it. \"She had a megaphone. She was a badass. Everybody really looked up to her to lead and she really came through and showed us that she could do it,\" he explained.\nWARNING: The former Jonas Brothers singer, known for his conservative roots, uses some language that is NSFW.\nCombining a few interests into one venture, Gigi dressed all the females in the video in GUESS swimwear. The two-time SI Swimsuit model is a face of the brand and has been known to bare all in the stylish and sometimes barely-there swim separates.\nNo stranger to music videos, Gigi previously starred in Taylor Swift 's \"Bad Blood\" video and Calvin Harris ' \"How Deep is Your Love\" video earlier this year. And while we're doubtful that the model will be making a move toward full-time, music-video work, one thing's for sureâ€”Gigi is a force to be reckoned with, who can accomplish anything she puts her mind to!\nBONUS: See some of Gigi's best moments from SI Swimsuit 2015!\nprevious next of\n( CLICK FOR FULL SIZE )", "external_links": ["http://cache.vevo.com/assets/html/embed.html?video=USUV71502665", "http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20960246,00.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:27:40.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
