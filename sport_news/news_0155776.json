Reservation was needed only for some time after Independence but now political parties have got involved in it,\" Hazare told reporters here. Hazare also advocated removal of poll symbols from ballot papers and EVMs as part poll reforms. \"I urge the Election Commission to remove symbol (from ballot papers and EVMs) as this is not a Constitutional arrangement. I am starting this issue from Sikar,\" he said. \"Our fight is not with the government, but with the Election Commission. I am beginning it from Sikar,\" Hazare said. Accusing both Congress and BJP of being involved in corruption, he said, \"These parties cannot eradicate corruption. The key for this is with voters.\" The BJP raised the issue of corruption before the Lok Sabha polls, but did not take initiatives to curb it after coming to power, he said, stressing that \"50 per cent of corruption could be controlled by Lokpal Bill only\". The social activist also targeted the political parties over the beef issue and asked why it was being raked up now. \"Why did they not see beef in the last 68 years? This all is just politics,\" he said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:04:38.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
