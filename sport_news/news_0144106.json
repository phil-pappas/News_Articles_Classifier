The semifinal winners will qualify for the Rio Olympics.\n\"Without a doubt, we've been improving since the very first game,\" Torres said through a translator. \"We still have a lot to improve and all the mistakes we've made, we're planning not to repeat them again. And everything we've done well? Continue to do that to be able to win.\n\"We have a game against Canada now. We're going to go out and win, no matter what.\"\nRaul Lopez also scored for Mexico.\nThe complexion of the game changed in the second minute, when Allans Vargas received a red card for appearing to hit a player in the face on a play and was sent off. Lopez lined a shot past goalkeeper Harold Fonseca.\nHonduras tied it in the 59th minute on a goal from Alberth Elis.\nBut Mexico soon responded, with Torres knocking a right-footed shot past Fonseca.
