(Michael S. Gordon / The Republican File) Comments \nArthur \"Ace\" Adams has returned to his Longmeadow home after a highly-successful season as pitching coach for the Fresno Grizzlies, a Triple A farm club of the Houston Astros. \n\"We won the Pacific Coast League, then went to El Paso (Tex.) where we beat Columbus of the International League 7-0 for the Triple A championship. It was a very good year, but with a lot of turnover on our roster,\" he said. \nTurnover, indeed. Altogether, Adams worked with 30 pitchers. Despite all the changes, the Grizzlies went 84-59, then rolled through the playoffs. \nDan Straily, a solid starter who had spent time on the major league roster, was supposed to pitch the Triple A title game, but got promoted again by the Astros. No problem - they brought up Chris Devenski from Double A Corpus Christi, and he delivered a walk-free one-hitter over seven innings. \nThe Fresno club also had the Pacific Coast League's MVP - third baseman Matt Duffy, now with the major league club. \nAdams has been in baseball since 1971, when the St. Louis Cardinals drafted him out of Wellesley High School. His resume includes collegiate jobs at Michigan, Brandeis, Harvard and Dartmouth. Before joining the Houston organization this season, Adams worked in the minors for the Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox, Florida Marlins and the Cardinals. \n\"The way I see it, I haven't worked a day in my life,\" he said. \nYOGI AND FRED: Springfield resident Fred Wojnarowski went to a game at Yankee Stadium in August, and brought something special with him - his uncle's trophy as a member of the Western Mass. Baseball Hall of Fame. \nHis uncle, the late Vic Raschi, won six World Series rings as a workhorse starting pitcher for Yankee powerhouse clubs of the late 1940s and early '50s. Known as \"The Springfield Rifle,\" Raschi was inducted into the WMass Hall of Fame last January, with his nephew accepting on his behalf. \n\"I brought the trophy with me because I thought somebody in Yankee management should know about it.\" he said. \nHe showed the award to Brian Richards, curator of the Yankee Museum at the stadium. He also showed him a clipping from The Republican which included the following anecdote that Wojnarowski told at the Hall of Fame banquet: \n\"When I was around 12 years old, my uncle Vic took me to Yankee Stadium and let me sit in the dugout before the game. Yogi Berra came up to me and said, 'I hear you're related to Raschi.' I said yes, he's my uncle. Yogi said, 'Kid, I feel sorry for you.'\" \nWojnarowski's story drew a big laugh from the Hall of Fame crowd. \nTo his surprise, he received an e-mail from the Yankees soon after Berra passed away on Sept. 22. \n\"They were so nice to remember me. They invited me to attend the memorial service for Yogi - and I told them I definitely will be there,\" Wojnarowski said. \nThe service for the beloved Hall of Famer will take place Sunday at the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center on the campus of Montclair State, Little Falls, N.J. \nSALVON FAREWELL: A capacity crowd at Twin Hills Country Club attended the seventh Joe Salvon Memorial Scholarship dinner on Sept. 25. This event, honoring a former Cathedral High School football player who passed away in 2009, has awarded scholarships to 10 Cathedral student/athletes. It also has served as a mini-reunion for Cathedral grads. \nBefore he introduced the 2015 winners - Nick Sears and Nico Sarkis - emcee Joe Salvon Jr. announced that this would be his family's last such endeavor. \n\"Everything has a shelf life. We wanted to go out on top, with applause still in the air,\" he said. \nMILT AND SAM: In what could be seen as a prime example of \"hockey karma,\" Boston Bruins great Milt Schmidt shared a birth date - March 5, 1918 - with a local legend, Springfield Newspapers' hockey writer Sam Pompei. \nSam first realized the connection when he began covering Bruins games at the old Boston Garden. Once he made Schmidt aware of it, they began years of friendship and \"Happy Birthday\" telephone calls. \nSam passed away in February of 2011, two weeks short of their 93rd birthday. Schmidt, now 97, will be honored Tuesday with a lifetime achievement award, to be presented by The Boston Globe. \nBEST BET for the weekend: Ready Dancer, in the Champagne Stakes at Belmont. \nGarry Brown can be reached at geebrown1918@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:50:34.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
