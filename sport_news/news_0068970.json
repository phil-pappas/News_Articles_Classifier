(AP) - Southern California ended a tumultuous week with a disappointing loss to No. 14 Notre Dame. \nThe Fighting Irish scored 17 points in the fourth quarter and picked off two of Cody Kessler’s passes to hold on for the 41-31 victory Saturday night in interim coach Clay Helton’s first game following the firing of Steve Sarkisian. \n“When it was crunch time, I thought they did a really good job to come up with the two turnovers there at the end,” Helton said. “Those were critical. They won the game when it was time.” \nThe Trojans rallied for three touchdowns after falling behind 21-10, but couldn’t come up with the stops they needed. The Irish took the lead on Corey Robinson’s diving catch with 9:06 left. \n“Once they got the ball rolling it was hard to stop them,” linebacker back Su’a Cravens said. \nNotre Dame showed the mental toughness it was sorely lacking in an embarrassing 35-point loss last season. \n“Our theme all week was the mental toughness that we wanted to exhibit today, it was the one question we wanted to answer,” Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. “I didn’t see anything on the sideline that resembled our guys not believing they were going to come back.” \nC.J. Prosise ran for 143 yards and two touchdowns, and DeShone Kizer threw two scoring passes, the second the 10-yarder to Robinson that made it 38-31. It was the first touchdown of the season for Robinson, who dropped several passes in the loss at Clemson. \n“I just had to step up when my number was called. Thank God I was able to step up for this team and contribute to our success,” Robinson said. \nUSC coaches are now 0-7 in their first games against Notre Dame in South Bend. \n“We had great momentum going into the second half. And then, at the end of the day, mistakes hurt us, whether it was penalties, special teams, some missed tackles and some turnovers on offense,” Helton said. “You can’t have those mistakes.” \nDeShone Kizer, who was 15 of 24 for 227 yards, said it was a big win for the Irish. \n“It’s huge. To come out here and get a signature win like that against USC is big for us and for the season moving forward,” he said. \nThe victory looked in doubt when the Trojans (3-3) scored three straight touchdowns to take a 31-24 lead as the Trojans scored on a 75-yard catch by JuJu Smith-Schuster and Adoree Jackson scored on an 83-yard pass. But the Irish rallied to win the Jeweled Shillelagh for the third time in four seasons. \n“If you miss a tackle, those kids are gone,” Kelly said. “They make you pay dearly, and we missed some tackles.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:23:12.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
