This is how they have reached two straight World Series. This is what the Mets are facing when the 111th World Series begins Tuesday.\nIn basketball, they would be the team that gets a shot off every possession and limits yours. In football, they would be the master of the consistent drive on offense combined with a shutdown defense. In baseball, they put it in play and force you to produce outs with your glove while being better than any other team in the sport with their gloves.\n“You better execute on both sides of the ball,” Toronto manager John Gibbons told The Post by phone. “They have mastered playing that close game. They manufacture on offense, they limit you on defense, their fundamentals are good both ways. Their game is that close, low-scoring game, and they are great at it because they just don’t make many mistakes.”\nGibbons just watched the Royals play six games up close. He saw the formula that has made Kansas City so special. He saw firsthand the numbers come to life as the Royals beat his Blue Jays in the ALCS.\nThe Royals struck out just 15.9 percent of their plate appearances. In this whiff-heavy era, the second-best — Oakland at 18.1 percent — was a good distance away.\nThe Mets have dominated this postseason with power starting pitching and, in a way, had the perfect opponent in the NLCS. The Cubs struck out in 24.5 percent of their plate appearances — the highest in the majors.\nThe most obvious angle of this Fall Classic is all of Kansas City’s contact bats vs. the Mets’ flamethrowers. But, of course, it goes beyond that. Because once the Royals put it in play, they tend to maximize their trips around the bases by stealing, taking extra bases.\nThe decisive run in the ALCS was produced in Game 6 Friday, when Lorenzo Cain scored from first on a single to right by Eric Hosmer. Hosmer took a wide turn around first to coax Toronto right fielder Jose Bautista to throw toward second rather than fire to a cut-off man lined up for home. And the Royals advanced scouting showed Bautista would do exactly that on a play in which he had to move toward the right-field line.\n\n“You better execute on your end,” Gibbons said. “They will gamble on the bases. You throw to the wrong base, they are going to make you pay. And they don’t half-ass it on the bases. They excel at small ball, and you have to be ready for anything at any time. We were not used to seeing what they do in the AL East.”\nMeanwhile, on defense they are pretty much excellent everywhere, particularly at shortstop with Alcides Escobar, left field with Alex Gordon and center field with Lorenzo Cain — and late in the game they will often move Jarrod Dyson to center and Cain to right and produce as close to a lockdown outfield as there is.\nFangraphs does a stat called Defensive Runs Above Average, and the Royals led the majors at 56.9. The second best was the Giants, a wide distance back at 30.2. It essentially means Kansas City is making far more plays and creating far more outs than any other club.\nThe Royals have a power pitching staff, as well, particularly in the end game with Kelvin Herrera and indomitable closer Wade Davis. In this postseason, Royals pitching is actually averaging more strikeouts per nine innings (10.69) than the Mets’ (10.24). Combine that with the elite defense, and it is hard to sustain rallies against Kansas City.\n“They have this style and it works for them,” Gibbons said. “They will get plenty of strikeouts. They have a lot of hard throwers in their rotation and especially the back of their bullpen. But they are just sound when you hit it. Again, they are good at that low-scoring close game because they don’t give stuff away.”\nSo what will be preeminent in this World Series: the ability of Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz to miss bat or the Royals’ sport-best skill in making contact? If it is the Royals making contact, will the Mets’ defense be able to slow Kansas City’s aggression?\nConversely, will the Mets be able to find the few nooks and crannies on the field against the Royals to produce enough hits to win?\nAppreciating all the Royals do, Gibbons summed it up simply, but insightfully: “They are just a good baseball team.”\n  john gibbons ,  kansas city royals ,  new york mets ,  toronto blue jays ,  world series", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:03:24.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
