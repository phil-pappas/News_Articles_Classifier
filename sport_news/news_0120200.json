Here's a look back at how they did it and who stood out.\nScoreboard UTAH CAL 0 0 Full box score/Player stats Upcoming 36 Mins 49 Secs SALT LAKE CITY â€” It wasn't pretty, and it certainly wasn't easy, but No. 5 Utah defeated No. 23 California 30-24 Saturday night, leaving the Utes as the last remaining undefeated Pac-12 team.\nScoring recap: After Cal turned the ball over twice on its first two possessions, Utah drew first blood on an Andy Phillips 44-yard field goal to give the Utes a 3-0 lead midway through the first quarter. However, the Bears responded quickly. Quarterback Jared Goff dropped in a beautiful 35-yard touchdown pass to Trevor Davis just minutes later to give Cal a 7-3 lead with 4:09 left in the first quarter.\nIt was the Bears' only lead of the game.\nUtah running back Devontae Booker bounced off a pair of potential tacklers on Utah's ensuing drive and made another defender whiff on a 40-yard touchdown run to give the Utes a 10-7 lead. The Bears tied the game with 6:17 left in the first half after Matt Anderson connected on a 22-yard field goal on a drive set up by a Utah turnover.\nThat's when the turnover situation got interesting. Devante Downs picked off Utah quarterback Travis Wilson with a little less than five minutes left in the half. On the very next play, Goff threw an interception to Justin Thomas. Utah turned that interception into points as Wilson connected with Cory Butler-Byrd on a 54-yard touchdown pass to give Utah a 17-10 lead.\nMoments later, Gionni Paul made a spectacular diving catch to pick off Goff yet again, setting up a 4-yard Booker touchdown run with 1:47 left before halftime. Cal used that time to answer back. Goff capped off a seven-play, 75-yard drive in a little less than 90 seconds with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Darius Powe, and the Utes went into the half leading 24-17.\nUtah opened the second half with the ball, eventually cashing in on a 36-yard field goal from Phillips four minutes into the half to extend the lead to 27-17. Neither team scored again until late in the third quarter when Cal running back Tre Watson rumbled in from 4 yards out to cut Utah's lead down to 27-24. Phillips tacked on a 39-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, and the Utes thwarted any potential game-winning drive in the end. Utah cornerback Boobie Hobbs sealed the win by breaking up a fourth-down pass intended for Powe with 26 seconds left in the game.\nUtah's Three Stars\nThe entire secondary\nThere's not enough stars to hand out on Utah's secondary because big plays came from everyone. It started when Marcus Williams picked off a Goff pass on Cal's opening drive and ended when Hobbs came in a broke up Goff's fourth-down attempt in the final fleeting seconds of the game. Tevin Carter led the team with nine tackles, Dominique Hatfield added two interceptions, and Justin Thomas picked off another pass. Goff threw just seven interceptions in 2014 and threw five on Saturday, and it made all the difference in the ballgame.\nIt didn't end there. Butler-Byrd also broke up a pass in the end zone and also scored on a 54-yard touchdown pass on his first catch as a wide receiver this season.\nDevontae Booker, RB\nBooker dominated all game long finishing with 222 yards rushing (seven yards shy of his career high set last year in a win over Oregon State) and also running in a pair of scores. Booker carried the offense with his 6.5 yards per carry on 34 attempts. Without his big performance, Utah may not have pulled off the win.\nGionni Paul, LB", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638805%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1444698889", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://img.youtube.com/vi/-a8Iik8YUcU/0.jpg", "http://img.youtube.com/vi/3C3D9fDWRm4/0.jpg", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638805%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1444698890", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638805%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1444698891", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-boxscores.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/results/2015-2016/boxscore48393.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638805%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1444698889", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638805%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1444698890", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865638805%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1444698891"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:26:53.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
