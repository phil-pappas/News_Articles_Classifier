(AP Photo/Frank Augstein) more > By JOHN PYE -   \nLONDON (AP) - For all the potential for mayhem after Japan’s shocking opening win over South Africa, the biggest upset in Rugby World Cup history, the quarterfinals panned out as expected with one glaring exception. \nThe host team isn’t there, for the first time. \nBack-to-back losses to Wales and Australia ended England’s hopes of advancing from the toughest of the pools. \nThe top two in each pool finished almost precisely in order of international rankings. Japan had wins over the Springboks, Samoa and the United States, but a loss to Scotland proved very, very costly. Japan became the first team ever to win three of four pool matches and not advance to the knockout rounds. And so there are no second-tier teams in the last eight - Fiji’s run to the 2007 quarterfinals was the last by a current Tier Two team. \nThe Brave Blossoms slipped out of contention when a shaky Scotland held off Samoa 36-33 on the next-to-last day of the pool stage, securing second spot in Pool B behind South Africa. Still, Japan, which had registered only one victory previously at the World Cup - in 1991 vs. Zimbabwe - was the revelation of the tournament under veteran coach Eddie Jones, who also guided an underrated Australia team to the 2003 final. \nWith Japan hosting the 2019 World Cup, and with a record 25 million people in Japan watching the win over Samoa on TV, the game is destined to grow in their homeland. \nAlas, the 2015 edition continues, and with a very North vs. South feel. \nThe pick of next weekend’s matches is New Zealand against France, a rematch of the 2011 final, and of a quarterfinal at the same stage and venue as the famous French upset in Cardiff in 2007. \n“As long as you are in the race, you have reasons to believe,” France captain Thierry Dusautoir, a survivor from that win eight years ago, said after Sunday’s 24-9 loss to Ireland consigned his team to a quarterfinal against the defending champion. “I have played 11 or 12 times against the All Blacks, and not once we have been favorites. But it didn’t stop us from beating them (in 2007), and the last time we were really close to beating them (in 2011).” \nThe All Blacks haven’t been in peak form so far, but they haven’t needed to be - yet. \nThe other quarterfinals are: Australia vs. Scotland, South Africa vs. Wales, and Ireland vs. Argentina. \nHere’s some things we learned during the group stage: \n___ \nGAP NARROWS \nThere weren’t any triple-figure blowouts in the results. And, as Namibia coach Phil Davies said, it wasn’t a pointless exercise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:21:51.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
