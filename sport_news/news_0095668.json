Shortly afterward two high-level managers fled, one bare-chested and the other with his shirt and suit jacket shredded.\nAlexandre de Juniac, the CEO of Air France-KLM, had announced Friday the company would have to cut jobs after failing to reach an agreement with pilots. French media, citing the unions, on Monday reported a proposal to slash 2,900 jobs.\nDe Juniac said the company was being squeezed by low-cost airlines in Europe and Gulf carriers for long-haul flights. Monday's meeting was intended to detail the cuts, which he told Europe 1 radio would be \"significant.\"\nAmong those at Monday's protest was Yves Porte, an activist who represents cargo workers.\n\"At a certain moment, the Gulf companies, who have low fuel prices and who receive government subsidies, compete with us. It's impossible, we are not on a level playing field,\" he said.\nAir France said it would file a complaint for aggravated assault.\nAlthough Monday's scuffle was unusually violent, labor relations in France are commonly testy, with unions sometimes even resorting to holding managers hostage — or \"boss-napping\" — to make a point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:02:22.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
