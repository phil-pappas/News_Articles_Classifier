(Photo: Dale G. Young, Detroit News) \nAnn Arbor — Michigan State came into Saturday’s matchup with Michigan with several players ailing, and the Spartans will once again be short a few players.\nJunior cornerback Darian Hicks (concussion) is not dressed for No. 7 Michigan State, meaning true freshmen Josh Butler and Tyson Smith are that much closer to playing for the first time this season. It could also lead to junior Demetrious Cox moving back to cornerback and a true freshman — Khari Willis or Grayson Miller — playing safety.\nThe offensive line appears to be getting some help as junior left tackle Jack Conklin (knee) is dressed, and will start. He has missed the last two games after leaving the Central Michigan game early. Fifth-year senior center Jack Allen is on the dress list, but his status remains up in the air after hurting his ankle last week at Rutgers.\nRedshirt freshman running back Madre London is also not dressed after injuring his left leg last week against Rutgers.\nmatt.charboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:21:05.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
