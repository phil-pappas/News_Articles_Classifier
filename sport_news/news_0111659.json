The Avera McKennan Fitness Center has a test to determine how your body has aged. \nDiabetes can cause you to age quicker, along with being overweight. You definitely want to keep your body fat percentage in check, but flexibility might be the number one thing most people overlook. \n\"As we age, we lose that flexibility. It's also going to help you with your everyday activities, like getting out of bed in the morning and getting through the day. As you age, your flexibility goes. You lose your balance,\" Avera McKennan Fitness Center Personal Trainer Donald Strand said. \nAnother mistake many people make? They focus solely on cardio or strength when working out. You want to mix the two to best fight aging. \nTonight on HealthBeat on KELOLAND News at 6 p.m., Casey Wonnenberg will take you behind the scenes of the test and tell you how you can get involved.
