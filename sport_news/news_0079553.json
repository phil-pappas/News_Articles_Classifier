Advertisement \nWorkhorse running back Jordan Myers rushed 41 times for 316 yards in the win over the Wolverines in the District 24-6A matchup. \nClear Falls, meanwhile, dropped a 56-14 decision to Clear Creek. The Knights tied the game at 7-7 early in the contest, but Creek’s explosive offense proved to be too much as the Wildcats took control of the game in the second quarter. \nShould the Knights lose this district game, they’d likely have to win their final four to reach the post-season. \nClear Lake (1-4, 0-2) vs. Clear Brook (0-5, 0-2), 7 p.m., Friday, League City: One of these teams’ playoff hopes will take a big hit while the other will still be in the postseason mix following the conclusion of this game. \nClear Brook fell to Dickinson, 42-28, last week but gave the Wolverines a difficult time as Brook led 21-20 at halftime, and was within 34-28 late in the third quarter. The past two weeks, Brook has led Clear Creek and Dickinson at halftime, something no other team is likely to accomplish this season. \nBrandon Taylor moved into the quarterback slot for Brook last week and provided an electric option for the Wolverines, throwing and running the ball. \nClear Lake had a difficult time with Clear Springs last Saturday, falling behind quickly and never recovering in a 51-7 loss. \nThe Falcons will look to regain their offensive touch while trying to slow down a Clear Brook offense that appears to be getting better each week. \nClear Creek (5-0, 2-0) at Brazoswood (2-3, 0-2), 7 p.m., Friday, Freeport: The Wildcats look to retain a share of the top spot in District 24-6A when they travel to play the Buccaneers. \nThe Wildcats, who are averaging 420 yards per contest, are led by running back Da’Von Smith (87 carries, 521 yards) and quarterback Chase Hildreth (80-124-3int-15TD) along with wide receiver Landon Etzel (28 catches, 335 yards). \nBrazoswood ranks last in defense in District 24-6A, allowing 369.4 yards per contest, but is third in team offense at 385 yards per game. Buc wide receiver Jackson Millar leads the district with 32 catches for 399 yards. \nCreek is averaging 40.2 points per game. \nClear Springs (3-2, 2-0) vs. Friendswood (3-2, 2-0), 6 p.m., Saturday, League City: This matchup, the best in District 24-6A this week, is as even as the teams’ record. \nThe Chargers average 355.4 yards per game while Friendswood is permitting just 341.2. \nMustang quarterback Tyler Page is the second leading rusher in the district (110 carries, 610 yards) and Charger running back Adrion Smith is ranked third (96 carries, 573 yards). Charger quarterback Will McBride has completed 52 of 103 passes for 736 yards and seven touchdowns. \nThe winner of this game all but locks up a playoff berth, needing just one more win to secure that spot. \nDawson (4-2, 3-1) vs. Manvel (5-0, 3-0), 7 p.m., Friday, Alvin: The Eagles were already going to be tested severely, but coming off an overtime loss to Pearland will challenge Dawson’s mettle.Dawson appeared headed for a victory over the Oilers, leading 21-13 in the fourth quarter, but the Oilers responded with a touchdown and a two-point conversion to force the OT and Pearland eventually pulled out the win.Dawson is led by quarterback Zach Smith, running back Saevion Johnson and swarming defense that may be as quick as any head coach Eric Wells has had on the Dawson campus.The Eagles will need all of that and more in going up against one of the state’s best teams in the Mavericks, who have no less than 12 NCAA Division I signees or commitments.Foremost of those is quarterback D’Eriq King, whose elusiveness provides constant headaches for any defense. His running and throwing skills provide the Mavericks with a dimension most teams don’t possess.Combine his ability with a wealth of talent on both sides of the ball for the Mavericks, and it’s no surprise that Manvel has already scored 75 points twice in District 22-6A football games.Both of these teams will likely be small-school representatives when the Class 6A playoffs unfold in November.Alvin (4-1, 2-1) vs. Pearland (6-0, 4-0), 7 p.m., Friday, Pearland: The Oilers will try to avoid a letdown after their stirring overtime win against rival Dawson this past Friday.Pearland used Jacob Whitehead’s overtime TD pass to Cody Williams along with Cody Bernstein’s PAT to lift the Oilers to a 28-27 victory.The Oilers had to rally from a 21-13 deficit in the fourth quarter, doing so with Connor Blumrick’s 41-yard TD pass to Brady Basso and subsequent 2-point conversion pass to Chase Foster to tie the game, forcing the OT.Alvin, meanwhile, enters the game off a convincing 42-15 victory over Pasadena Memorial that keeps the Yellowjackets firmly in line for a playoff berth.The only blemish on Alvin’s schedule is a 45-13 loss to Dawson.Alvin jumped to a 35-8 halftime lead on Memorial last week, en route to the win. The Jackets were fueled by six touchdown passes from Garrett Gray, who completed 21 of 27 passes for 402 yards. Jerry Dickens caught 11 of those passes for five touchdowns and 267 yards.Alvin is one of five District 22-6A teams (the other four being Pearland, Dawson, Manvel and Pasadena Dobie) contending for four playoff spots. \nLutheran South (5-0, 0-0) at Houston Second Baptist (2-3 0-0), 7 p.m., Friday: The Pioneers will likely have a difficult challenge this week against a team predicted to win TAPPS District 3, Division II by Texas Football magazine. \nSecond Baptist is led by Lynnard Rose, a versatile 6-1, 180-pound athlete. The Eagles enter the game off a 38-27 win over Austin Regents, and Second Baptist’s other victory this year came against Houston St. John’s 27-21. \nHowever, Second Baptist lost to Tomball Concordia Lutheran, 28-14, a team which Lutheran South defeated 67-38 this past weekend. \nLSA quarterback Patrick Gonzalez enjoyed a record-setting day, throwing for seven touchdowns and more than 500 yards. \nThis game is the district opener for both teams and could ultimately decide the district championship. \nBay Area Christian (0-6) vs. The Woodlands Christian Academy (3-2), 7 p.m., Friday, League City: The Broncos almost picked up their first win of the season last week, but fell to Lutheran North, 30-24. \nDespite the loss, the outcome was encouraging for the Broncos, who had only scored six points all year prior to their 24-point output last week.The Woodlands Christian Academy defeated Bryan St. Joseph, 24-21, last Friday.The Warriors are picked to win TAPPS District 4, Division III by Texas Football magazine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:36:19.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
