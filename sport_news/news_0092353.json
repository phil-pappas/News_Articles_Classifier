KGW Staff 11:36 p.m. PDT October 21, 2015 PIL district meet CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPORTLAND, Ore. -- The family of a Portland high school cross country runner is suing the school district over the decision to suspend their son earlier this month for an alcohol violation. \nHaven Riffel is one of Grant High School's top cross country runners . \nHis parents said that his 28-day-suspension is preventing him from finishing the cross country season and could cost him college scholarships. \nAccording to the lawsuit, Riffel's family argues the school district didn't give him the chance for legal representation at a disciplinary hearing earlier this month, a violation of the district's own policy. \nThe district says it can't get into the specifics of Riffel's case, but says all student-athletes know of the suspension policy for alcohol or drug use. \n\"If we were to move this rule at all, it would lose its impact,\" said Christine Miles of Portland Public Schools. \"I think, in this case, it's just a tough situation for the students, the parents and the faculty.\" \nThe family wanted a temporary restraining order to let Riffel run the rest of the fall season. \nThe Portland Interscholastic League district race was held Wednesday and Riffel did not compete, therefore did not have a chance to qualify for the 6A state championship meet in Eugene on Oct. 31. \nKGW reached out to the runner's attorney for comment, but did not hear back. \nTop local headlines:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:06:54.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
