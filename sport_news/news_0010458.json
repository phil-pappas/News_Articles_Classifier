This week, Sam Page, Michael Blinn and Al Muir talk about the Blue Jackets’ hiring of John Tortorella, the best Russian player in the league and several more topics. First up: • The Columbus Blue Jackets turned to John Tortorella on Wednesday to salvage their season. How do you see this playing out? Sam Page: The Jackets are shooting 4.55% as a team, while their goalies have a .857 save percentage. No team is that bad at shooting and Sergei Bobrovsky is obviously capable of much more. Columbus just isn’t getting any of the breaks right now. And while those stats don’t excuse what many have identified as flagging effort, I think you could appoint me, Tortorella or any Muppet other than Fozzie Bear as coach and expect a dramatic improvement in the short term. As far as the entire season goes, though, I doubt Tortorella is a savior. The team will probably retain him after this year, citing improvement after his hiring. He’ll get the Jackets into the playoffs next year as a low seed. They’ll lose in the first round.
