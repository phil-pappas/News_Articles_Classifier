It’s what HP adds that makes it incredibly interesting.\nThere’s the illuminator, which sits above the screen. It houses a projector, a high resolution 14.6 megapixel camera, and an Intel RealSense 3D camera. You can scan 2D and 3D objects and documents.\nThen there’s the 20-point touch-enabled mat. Whatever you place on the touch mat can be scanned to the library on the display, porting it from the real world to a virtual one.\nThe mat is also a projector screen, displaying whatever the illuminator beams to it. It can morph from a QWERTY keyboard into, say, a piano keyboard, depending what app you run.\nSuddenly the space in front of a desktop that’s usually a hardware keyboard can be whatever you want it to be. It needs a bit of fine-tuning but it’s still a clever concept that deserves praise.\nThe Windows 10 operating system considers the touchmat to be a second display and you can open your browser on the mat and scroll through websites while performing other tasks on the main screen. You can also use it to scroll through Facebook and Twitter posts, or watch movies.\nThe magic happens when you load the HP Sprout ecosystem. The main display becomes a repository of items you have scanned and a way to access the Sprout Marketplace, with more than 20 special programs. The mat also turns into an app drawer for accessing them and a workspace.\nDemonstration apps include Virtual DJ, which turns the main display into a DJ’s console with two turntables and a labyrinth of controls on the touch mat. The piano app lets you play along in Pianola mode with the music score on the screen, or you can record with the keyboard.\nThe core apps revolve around designing. You can flick objects from the screen on to the mat, resize and rearrange them, add text, change textures, and then print or 3D print them. Alternatively you can design or scan in cartoon characters and animate them. The idea of Sprout is that every design-oriented task can happen in one place, with no need for a separate scanner or a tablet. It does the lot.\nWhile the Sprout is a clever idea, in the end, the mat is a projection, so the resolution isn’t that high: 1024x768 pixels. The Adonit Jot Pro stylus, while useful for sketching, isn’t really designed for precise artwork.\nThat renders the Sprout good for some things and not others. It’s more than adequate for making posters and cards at home and also useful for brewing up concept designs. But for precise, professional work, you wouldn’t use the mat. 2D scanning of shallow objects works fine but 3D scanning is laborious. To scan say, a toy elephant involved 18 scans: six of the left side, six of the middle and six at the right. You scan so that the Sprout can add new chunks of the model adjacent to existing sections; otherwise you end up with a mess. Not all objects are suitable for scanning. But with care, and the right model, you get good results.\nHP throws in a wireless keyboard and mouse, but as the touch mat is large, you might not fit both the keyboard and mat between you and the Sprout. I found the virtual keyboard projected on the mat too small for comfortable typing and HP should consider giving users a choice of sizes.\nThe Sprout sports a 4th generation Intel Core i7 processor, Nvidia graphics and a 1 Terabyte hybrid drive. It clocked 40.24 frames per second running the Cinebench 15 graphics test, while the CPU scored 715cb. The 23-inch display is 10-point touch-­enabled.\nThe Sprout costs $US1899 in the US but in Australia it will set you back $3999. The 3D capture stage costs an extra $599. It’s expensive, but if you like the concept, the price may be worth it and your kids will love it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:15:45.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
