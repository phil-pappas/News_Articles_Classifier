Photo: Gretchen Ertl, New York Times FBI launches inquiry intobooming industry’s tactics 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The FBI has begun an inquiry into the practices of booming daily fantasy sports sites after players and lawmakers made allegations of predatory tactics and questioned the use of inside information, according to players who said they have been contacted by investigators.\nThe FBI began contacting several prominent competitors in the contests shortly after an employee of DraftKings, one of the two major companies, admitted to inadvertently releasing data before lineups for the start of the third week of NFL games were locked in. The employee, a mid-level content manager, then won $350,000 at a rival site, although DraftKings said he did not have an advantage.\nDaily fantasy sites have exploded in popularity and this season have blanketed football game broadcasts with ubiquitous advertisements to lure more players, who pay an entry fee, build virtual rosters of players and win prizes, from $22 to up to $2 million, based on the performance of players in games.\nThe FBI declined to comment.\nAgents want to know whether employees of DraftKings passed on proprietary information or preyed on players in contests, according to the players. DraftKings, as well as rival company FanDuel, acknowledged that their employees — many of whom regularly rank among the most consistent big winners — have played and won significant money on each other’s sites. In the wake of the scandal, they banned their employees from competing in any contests.\nThe allegations have also raised a bevy of issues in the unregulated industry, including whether professional players have an unfair advantage over regular players. A recent study in Sports Business Daily found that over the first half of this year’s Major League Baseball season, 91 percent of daily fantasy sports player profits were won by just 1.3 percent of the players. In fact, on average, the top 11 players paid $2 million in entry fees and made profits of $135,000 each while accounting for 17 percent of all entry fees.\nMany of those players use automated processes that let them change hundreds, if not thousands, of lineups in seconds, a decided advantage when last-minute changes are made in the real lineups of professional football, basketball or baseball teams.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the FBI interviews with players.\nThe New York attorney general last week opened an inquiry, first reported by the New York Times , into the prospect that employees of DraftKings and FanDuel, the leading daily fantasy companies, won lucrative payouts based on information not available to the public. In addition, three class-action suits have been filed alleging fraud — the most recent in Louisiana, where the operation of daily fantasy sports is prohibited.\nThe plaintiff, Artem Genchanok, a New Orleans resident, said he had paid entry into DraftKings and FanDuel contests and deposited money on their websites despite the prohibition.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/55/8792915/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/55/8792915/3/920x920.jpg", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:01:16.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
