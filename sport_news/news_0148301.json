The Lady Bulldogs jumped to an 8-3 the start in Game 1 and maintained a comfortable lead until the Lady Indians made their run and closed within 21-19. A tip at the net from Peighton Parks and an ace from Lixi Wheeler moved the score to 23-19. CWC scored the next two points to close the set. In Game 2 the Lady Bulldogs ran away early, causing Johnston City to call timeouts trailing 9-3 and 13-6. In this game CWC was very effective in tipping the ball over the net rather than attempting tougher kill shots. The game ended 25-7 on an ace from Paige Winter. In the earlier games, the CWC freshmen won 25-9, 25-22 and the JV remained undefeated with a 25-11, 25-19 victory.
