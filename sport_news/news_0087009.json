(Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports) The Sports Xchange \nNew York Giants tight end Daniel Fells could have his foot amputated from a staph infection, according to NFL.com. \nFells has had five surgeries to stave off the infection and doctors are fighting to avoid amputating his foot, Ian Rapoport of NFL Media reported Sunday. \nFells has been hospitalized for more than a week as he battles a persistent MRSA infection ( methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) that necessitated being placed in the intensive care unit on Friday, according to the report. He is expected to undergo more operations on his foot, which is at risk for further infection. \nAccording to Rapoport, citing a source with knowledge of Fells ' condition, doctors also fear that the MRSA has infected his bone and could travel into his blood. \nGiants spokesman Pat Hanlon told ESPN.com that it \"is a serious situation that has been taken seriously from the beginning. We're all fighting for Daniel .\" \nFells , 32, was placed on season-ending injured reserve Monday. \nAfter Fells ' diagnosis, the Giants took precautions to prevent further spread of MRSA by scrubbing their locker room, training room and meeting rooms, a source told ESPN.
