Rita Jeptoo, last year's winner and a three-time Boston champion, is under a two-year ban after testing positive for the blood-booster EPO several weeks before last year's Chicago Marathon. \nKenyan Florence Kiplagat is the top returning woman after a third-place finish in 2:25.57. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:53:55.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
