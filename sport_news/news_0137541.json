But Rafferty had his hands full, needing a big surge in the final half-mile to win in 15:24 and hold off a familiar senior rival, J.P. Flavin of Toms River North, who ran 15:31.\nToms River North had claimed both team titles in this meet a year ago, but this time it was Southern Regional claiming the two team crowns and relegating the defending champion Mariners to second in the boys event and to third in the girls race.\nThe course records — 14:43 by CBA’s Mike McClemens in 2013 and 17:14 by Molly McNamara of Red Bank Catholic in 2010 — were never endangered, but everybody on the premises expects the pace to be a lot quicker when the Shore Conference Championships come here next Thursday. Top nine teams and leading individuals in the first 25 in this one advanced to the conference meet, where they will face the best of the Monmouth County Championships, staged Tuesday at Holmdel Park.\n“I have great coaches (Glenda Calabro and Jenna Dubrow),” said O’Brien. “They were a big part of it.\n“I was pretty nervous early on today, I thought other runners were right on me. But then I looked around once, and they weren’t, and I was able to settle down.”\nO’Brien hopes to better all her top track times — 11 minutes flat for 3200 meters, 5:11 for 1600 two miles, 2:30 for 800 — this winter and spring before heading off to college. Temple and Delaware rank high on her checklist, and it was current Delaware freshman Lauren Zodl (the 2013-14 Ocean County champion for Pinelands) texting her good luck before this one.\n“Soon as I can, I’ll thank Lauren for that,” said O’Brien.\n“I got my school record (and rose to fourth on the all-time county charts at OCP), so I’m pretty happy with that, said Rafferty, who placed third in this race last year behind Brick Memorial’s Kyle Mueller (now at Monmouth) and Flavin. Best known as a 4:16 miler in the track season, Rafferty has big plans to cut all his times and gain some national recognition this winter and spring.\n“My dad was a soccer and baseball player, my mom a roller skater, so I guess track, for me, just kind of popped up,” said Rafferty, whose top college choices at the moment are Maryland, Rutgers and Monmouth.\n“Ryan’s a great team leader; he ran this race perfectly,” said Jackson Memorial boys coach Steve Theobald. “Two weeks ago, we came here and just ran (repeats of) that last half-mile, so he knew when to took off today. He’s an awesome guy, and he’s very well deserving.”\n“Caitlin has really turned the corner the past few weeks, as we moved into the championship part of the season,” said coach Calabro who (as Glenda Yeck) was the 1974 Ocean County champion for Brick.\n“She’s a really hard worker. She stepped up big-time today. And (runner-up) Kennedy Gerrat, she’s a terrific runner, too, a junior who moved into Jackson from Texas last winter. She played basketball and then ran outdoor track. But she didn’t run a single step all summer, and all her training has been since September 1st.”\nFor Southern Regional girls coach Brian Zatorski, victory lane was familiar territory. His Rams have now won four titles this century, the earlier ones in 2001, 2007 and 2011.\n“We’ve got a nice, tight group and they just believe they can do it,” said Zatorski, whose top runner was third-placer Elizabeth Chartier in 18:50.\n“Liz is a senior, but this is her first season with us. She’s come over from soccer. But we all know she’s a real runner — she was fourth in the Meet of Champions 800. She’s run 2:12 in the 800 and can definitely do it. Cross country is just a natural progression for her.”\nA spectacular sixth in the boys race was Point Pleasant Borough freshman Devin Hart at 16:11, and one spot behind him was Adam Adanatzian, the sophomore who led the winning Southern team in 16:19.\n“Our boys are pack runners,” said Southern boys coach Scott Baker. “They run together, and they run strong. We have a lot more to give. We’re going to be a lot better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:06:58.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
