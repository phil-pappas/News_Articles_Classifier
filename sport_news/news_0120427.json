Dillon as a solo act, they are awfully tough.\nWhen the Spartans decide to get the rest of the band up onto the stage with Dillon, however, they may be unstoppable. A very good St. Sebastian’s team found that out the hard way yesterday, as the hosts showed off their entire offensive arsenal en route to a commanding 47-30 win.\nThe setback was the first for the Arrows (3-1) in the Independent School League, while the Spartans (3-1) look to be gaining their stride after an early season setback to Governor’s Academy.\n“In the films that we saw, they really didn’t get (their other offensive weapons) too involved, it was more just Dillon,” veteran Arrows coach Bob Souza noted. “We were sort of geared to stop him, but then they start to beat you with other things and it’s tough. That’s a good team.”\nDillon was certainly impressive with 184 yards and four touchdowns on 15 carries, but so too were senior quarterback Jake Cassidy (133 yards passing, 2 TDs) and his favorite target, wideout Sherron Dailey-Harris (four catches, 99 yards, 2 TDs). Then there was senior Demitri Jackson, whose electrifying 75-yard punt return at the end of the third quarter all but put the game away.\n“People think of us mostly as a run team, but I think we showed that we can definitely do more than one thing,” Dillon said.\nThe balanced attack proved to be too much for the gritty visitors, who were without standout junior fullback and linebacker Blake Gallagher due to an ankle injury. Despite that sizeable void, the Arrows found themselves right in it when quarterback Tommy Seidl (18-for-28, 203 yards, TD, two INT) found Mike Calabro from 14 yards out just before the half to cut the hosts’ lead to 21-14.\nThings unraveled quickly, however, as the Spartans’ defense flexed its muscles. Dillon forced a key turnover from Seidl with a thunderous sack from his linebacker position, and scored his third touchdown of the day four plays later. On the Arrows’ next possession, Jacob Byczko — who had two sacks — picked off Seidl. Three plays later, a leaping Dailey-Harris made a fingertip catch of a Cassidy bullet to boost the lead to 34-14.\nWide receiver Jack Frisoli (nine catches, 97 yards, TD) had a strong game in the loss. Lawrence travels to BB&N next week, while St. Sebastian’s travels to Governor’s Academy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:23:56.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
