In Lakota’s 35-14 win over Montpelier in Week 4, the 5-foot-10, 200-pounder not only came up with a pair of interceptions, but he also took both of them back for touchdowns on returns of 44 and 65 yards. Ferree and the Raiders (3-3 overall) are two wins shy of their first .500 season since 2008 and are in contention for a postseason berth. Lakota will host Sandusky River League rival St. Mary Central Catholic Friday night. \nQ: What is your biggest pet peeve? \nAF: Losing. Just losing. I hate losing. \nQ: What’s your biggest fear? \nAF: Getting hurt and not being able to play. Not being there for my teammates to help them out. \nQ: If you could have any superpower, what would it be? \nAF: Strength, maybe. You can get some girls. \nQ: If I asked your parents what is your worst habit, what would they say? \nAF: Not cleaning. I don’t like to clean. My room is nasty. Clothes everywhere. \nQ: Plans for after graduation? \nAF: I plan on being a pipe fitter.
