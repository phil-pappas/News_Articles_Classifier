(AP) - Minnesota Vikings cornerback Xavier Rhodes has passed his post-concussion tests and resumed practice with the team, following a scary collision on the field last week. \nRhodes was a full participant in practice Wednesday, three days after smacking into safety Andrew Sendejo while they both tried to make a tackle in the game against San Diego. Rhodes is expected to be OK when the Vikings play Sunday at Denver. \nSendejo, however, has a knee injury and did not practice Wednesday. He was replaced by Robert Blanton after getting hurt in the game. Wide receivers Charles Johnson (rib) and Jarius Wright (hand) were also held out of practice, along with defensive end Justin Trattou (foot).
