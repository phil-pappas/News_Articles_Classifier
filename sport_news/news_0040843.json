Skipper Abhinav Mukund (24) and Baba Aparajith (56) then added 63 runs for the second wicket before the former departed, caught and bowled by medium pacer Udit Birla (2/16). \n\nAparajith scored his runs off 133 balls with the help of six fours but he could not prolong his stay, nicking one to Naman Ojha behind the stumps of the bowling of Ishwar Pandey (2/57) at the team score of 100 in 44.1 overs. \n\nSenior batsman and wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik (29) followed suit four overs later, handing Pandey his second scalp of the day. Aparajith's brother Baba Indrajith too got a start, scoring 47 runs off 103 balls with the help of four boundaries and one six before becoming Birla's second victim of the day, caught by Ojha. \n\nAt stumps, Ramaswamy Prasanna was unbeaten on 51 which came off 118 balls and J Kousik on 14. For Madhya Pradesh, Pandey and and Birla shared four wickets between them while Puneet Datey (1/33) accounted for the other Tamil Nadu batsman. \n\nBrief Scores \n\nTamil Nadu: 225 for five in 89 overs (Baba Aparajith 56, Ramaswamy Prasanna 51 not out; Udit Birla 2/16)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:22:00.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
