New Jersey’s Nazi dad might finally see some justice.\nIsidore Heath Campbell, the infamous white supremacist who dresses in Nazi garb and named one of his children Adolf Hitler, is wanted on an aggravated assault charge, police said Tuesday.\nHolland Township Police issued an arrest warrant for the faux Fuhrer and asked the public for any information on his whereabouts.\nThe charge stems from a domestic incident Sunday night, Chief John Harris told the Daily News. He said the department does not release additional information on such cases.\nHarris said he told spoke to Campbell recently and \"advised him\" on the impending warrant, and cops haven't heard from him since.\nThe charge comes a year and a half after the wannabe Nazi’s wife, Deborah Campbell, also went on the run after the alleged assault of Campbell's new girlfriend, who lived with the couple. Police tracked the wife down and she pleaded guilty to simple assault.\nAt the time, the faux Fuhrer defended his bride and said she was a victim of bias against Nazis.\n“Society thinks the Germans and the Nazis are bad people when really we’re not,” he told the Daily News.\n“We’re family oriented.”\nThe neo-Nazi first rose to national notoriety seven years ago, when a supermarket refused to bake him a cake with the inscription \"Happy birthday Hitler,\" for his young son who is shamed with that name. The cake controversy inspired police to investigate Campbell and begin a series of custody court cases. Campbell regularly showed up in Nazi garb, with a Hitler moustache.\nThe self-professed family man is the father of nine children, from five women, and does not have custody of any of them. Child welfare workers took away his latest baby, Eva Braun, two days after she was born in late 2013.\njsilverstein@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories New Jersey Nazi defends parenting after losing custody Dad dons Nazi garb for kid custody battle in court Adolf Hitler still in foster care after 33 months", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Nazi-Dad-Fights-for-His-Childs-Custody-209910241.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:33:07.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
