The drive was capped by Cola's two-yard run. Cola added a second touchdown run on Park Vista's next drive and a third TD midway through the second quarter.\nPark Vista quarterback John Smith also had a good game as he passed for a touchdown and ran for another.\nThe Cobras defense was defiant as it held Spanish River to 145 yards of total offense and grabbed three interceptions.\nSpanish River (4-4, 1-4) finally scored with less than two minutes to go in the game on a six-yard pass from Owen Levine to Demetrius Garozzo.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621acc0/turbine/fl-spanish-river-park-vista-recap-1017-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:42:39.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
