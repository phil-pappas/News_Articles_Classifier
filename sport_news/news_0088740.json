Judging from afar the scene at the Ohio State game, he couldn't tell what was amiss with regard to the same raucous joint that helped Tech teams go 27-4 at home during his career from 2008 through 2012. \n\"I'm going to bleed maroon and orange the rest of my life regardless of whether they win all their games or go zero and however many games they play, but it is kind of crazy,\" said Roberts, a Smithfield High graduate who is in his first season as wide receivers coach at ASA College, a junior college in Brooklyn, N.Y. \"The atmosphere looks the same on TV…The games still look exciting, but I don't know what the problem is. We've got to get something straight. \nThe TV cameras lie. The crowd still jumps, the cannon still blasts and the band still plays in Lane Stadium, but something has changed. \nAs Tech enters Saturday's game against No. 23 Duke (5-1, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), the Hokies seem far removed from the days when coming to Blacksburg was an anxiety-inducing experience for Football Bowl Subdivision opponents. \nThe 2015 Virginia Tech football season in photos. \nTech (3-4, 1-2) has lost eight of its last 11 home games against FBS foes. It's 2-2 this season at home, including 1-2 against FBS opponents. Tech's last game at home Oct. 9 ended with an impressive 28-13 win against North Carolina State. \nDuke's last visit to Lane Stadium signaled the outset of this rocky stretch of home games. Two seasons ago, unranked Duke came to town and stunned No. 16 Tech 13-10 in frigid conditions. It was Tech's first loss in eight home games against Duke, and the last time the Hokies reached as high as No. 16 in the Associated Press poll. \nOver a 10 1/2-season span from '03 through the middle of the '13 season, Tech went 61-9 in Lane Stadium, never losing more than one game at home from '03 through '12 and going 6-0 in '08. Tech won 12 straight home games from the end of the '07 season through the middle of '09. \n\"The guys still seem as hungry as we were when I was there, but there always seems to be that one really bad thing that's going to hurt them at the end of games in Blacksburg,\" said Roberts, who is best remembered by Tech fans for his 11-yard touchdown catch in September 2009 in Lane Stadium on a pass delivered by Hampton High graduate Tyrod Taylor with 21 seconds left, leading Tech to a stunning 16-15 win against Nebraska. \n\"That's kind of what's different. That's kind of been the story.\" \nWhile Tech has struggled to close out wins in the place where it should feel most comfortable, Duke has been a force on the road, winning 11 of its last 12 games away from Wallace Wade Stadium. There's no magic formula for Duke's road success, according to coach David Cutcliffe. \n\"I've always liked going on the road in college football,\" Cutcliffe said. \"I think there is an environment of it's a business trip, and you're really confined more than maybe you are at home. The guys stay in the hotel (before games at home or on the road), but it's just a little different atmosphere (on the road).\" \nNo matter where Duke has played this season, it has been successful putting the brakes on opposing offenses. Duke is second in the nation in passing defense (131.2 yards per game) and scoring defense (9.3 points per game), and fourth in total defense (252.8). \nOnly six touchdowns have been scored against Duke, which features a scheme under defensive coordinator Jim Knowles that's as broad in the number of looks it throws at an offense as any team. Duke linebacker Dwayne Norman (51 tackles) and safeties Jeremy Cash (46 tackles, including an ACC-best 11.5 tackles for loss) and DeVon Edwards (41 tackles) all rank among the top 20 in the conference in tackles. \n\"I don't believe teams have been successful game-planning for them because they do so many different things,\" Tech wide receiver Cam Phillips said. \"You don't know what is coming, so they have that going for them. We're just trying to get a win in our stadium.\" \nAfter getting his first playing time in six weeks last weekend when he threw a touchdown and an interception in the fourth quarter of Tech's 30-20 loss at Miami, Hokies quarterback Michael Brewer will be back in the starting role against Duke. The broken clavicle he suffered against Ohio State has healed to the point he was able to take all the reps with the first-team offense this week in practice. \n\"It's definitely been a long ride,\" said Brewer of his rehab. \"Preparing the way that I did and this team did throughout the summer, we put a lot of hard work in, and then to see it slip away there in the first game was pretty tough. There's definitely been a lot of adversity trying to get back, but I'm back 100 percent, and it feels good to be back in that saddle.\" \nBrewer echoed Phillips' impressions of Duke's confusing defense. \n\"You may go 12 snaps in a row of a different coverage, blitz and front,\" Brewer said. \"It's pretty wild how they can be so good and so sharp in so many different things. Not a lot of teams can do that.\" \nIn Tech's 17-16 win last season at No. 19 Duke, the Hokies were able to sack then-Blue Devils quarterback Anthony Boone four times. They were four of just 13 sacks Duke surrendered all season. \nExcellent protection is again a hallmark of Duke's offense this season, as the Blue Devils have given up an ACC-low four sacks. \nQuarterback Thomas Sirk (62.4 percent completions, 1,260 yards, seven touchdowns and three interceptions) gets the ball out of his hands in a hurry, looking downfield for receivers Johnell Barnes (team-high 20 catches for 266 yards and a touchdown), Max McCaffrey and T.J. Rahming. Sirk also often incorporates quick passes to running backs Shaquille Powell (19 catches for 108 yards and two touchdowns) and Shaun Wilson. \nTech's pass rush has been hampered by persistent hand injuries to defensive end Dadi Nicolas, who has been dealing with a thumb injury on his left hand all season, plus jammed fingers on his right hand. He has no sacks this season, after finishing last season third in the ACC with nine sacks. \n\"Right now, it's kind of like he's 'lobster boy' or something out there,\" said Tech defensive line coach Charley Wiles, who added along with defensive coordinator Bud Foster that Nicolas still has been disruptive without full use of his hands. \"He doesn't have any grip, to a certain degree.\" \nWood can be reached by phone at 757-247-4642.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:46:27.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
