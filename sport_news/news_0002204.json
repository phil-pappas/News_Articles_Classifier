Jonny Gomez who the Royals traded for this summer will remain on the bench as an inspirational leader.\nGore hadn't been caught stealing in the big leagues until Monday's game against the Astros, and that took a controversial official review.\nThe Royals send out Edinson Volquez as their starting pitcher while the Blue Jays counter with Marco Estrada.\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 7:07 p.m. at Kauffman Stadium.
