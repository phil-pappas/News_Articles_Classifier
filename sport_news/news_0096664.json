The incident occurred Sunday in the 1900 block of Victoria Avenue.\nPolice say that around 10 a.m., the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Department received several calls around of an elderly black man firing a gun in front of a home in the 1900 block of Victoria Avenue. When responding officers arrived, the man went back inside and barricaded himself in the home. The Jefferson Parish SWAT Team was activated around 10:30 a.m.\nAuthorities on scene learned that a female, later identified as the man's 77-year-old wife, was also inside the home. After hours of negotiating with the man, the woman walked out of the home. Not long afterwards, the 73-year-old man, identified as Samuel McGinnis who lived at the home he barricaded himself in, emerged from the house. He was taken into custody.\nAccording to police, McGinnis was brought to West Jefferson Hospital for an emergency committal. Once he is released from the hospital, he will be booked in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center with one count of illegal discharging of a firearm.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
