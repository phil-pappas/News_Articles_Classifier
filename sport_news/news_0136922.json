He remembered “coming down to the dugout” to check on scores as the games were on television.\nHe won’t have to check the TV this time.\nThough Dodgers manager Don Mattingly declined to formally announce his starters Thursday, he predicted “no surprises.” Seager was the primary shortstop starter throughout September for the NL West champs and probably will stay in that role in Game 1 of the NLDS against the Mets Friday.\n“It’s been kind of unreal,” said Seager, 21, the younger brother of Seattle’s Kyle Seager. “I started in Double-A and now you’re ready to play in the postseason. It’s a little strange but a lot of fun at the same time.”\nNow Seager, who debuted Sept. 3, can watch Dodgers playoff baseball live. Could he fathom that last season?\n“To be honest, no. That’s something you don’t think is possible,” Seager said. “It’s been fun so far, and hopefully it will still be fun in the next couple days.”\nHitting the way Seager has is always fun. In a very small 27-game sample, Seager hit .337 (33-of-98) with four homers and 17 RBIs. Defensively, he won’t make anyone forget Ozzie Smith — or Jimmy Rollins, whose starting spot he usurped. Seager said Rollins has been nothing but supportive.\n“He’s always been there for me,” Seager said. “There have been no awkward moments.”\nRollins, though, hit a career-low .224, making the switch to Seager a bit easier.\n“He has a chance to be a superstar at the major league level,” one opposing scout said. “He’s one of the best pure hitters to come out in a long time. It wouldn’t shock me if he had a huge playoff series, if he just went off. This is a guy with a great feel to hit [with] power.”\nDodgers manager, Don Mattingly, has liked what he has seen — in all areas. Mattingly talked about seeing Seager’s growth the past few seasons.\n“[Now] you see all the baseball stuff’s easy,” Mattingly said. “You see it, he swings, stays in the strike zone, discipline, sees spin early, kind of the quietness of his hands, the clock is good, and then all the other stuff with that has been really good. As far as his demeanor around the locker room, relationships with teammates, you can see it’s good.\n“How he carries himself as far as he’s really humble, but you can see the confidence. It’s not like he’s shy or quiet about anything. It’s a humbleness, but there is a confidence there with it. So it’s kind of everything’s there. It’s something that you don’t see very often.”\n  corey seager ,  jimmy rollins ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:38.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
