The accessory ensures that there is a shower readily available. This eliminates the need to use on-site showers. Additionally, the unit features a compact, easily portable design that can be set up virtually anywhere.\nThe original design was submitted to the Orange County office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
