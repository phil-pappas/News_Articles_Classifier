The bulldogs were coming off a loss the previous game, which made their record 0-5. Not much changed against the Rams, as the dogs again failed to get a win with a final score of 42-14. Comment for the White Hall Journal The   By Brice Hoffmanfor the White Hall Journal Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 1:02 PM By Brice Hoffmanfor the White Hall Journal Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 1:02 PM The Bulldogs’ struggles started quite early as they muffed the opening kickoff which was recovered by the Rams. Shorty after, the Rams scored on a touchdown by Maurice Bradford (#6). With 3 minutes and 38 seconds left in the first quarter, a punt by the Dogs bought the Rams inside their own 1 yard-line. They weren’t phased though, as they drove the length of the field topped off by a 45 yard touchdown by Maurice Bradford. Shortly after the second quarter got underway, Rams’ Colt Housley (#45) scored a touchdown and a 2-point conversion. Later in the quarter, the Bulldogs fumbled on their own side of the field which went for a 40 yard score with 10 minutes and 38 seconds left in the first half. With only 9 seconds left in the first half, a completed pass to Caleb Dean (#17) would go for a Ram touchdown. The score ended being 36-7 with the Rams ahead at halftime. In the second half, the Bulldogs held the Rams to only one more score. It came with just under 10 minutes left in the third quarter as the rams drove down the field and scored on a 1 yard touchdown by Colt Housley. In the final quarter of play, Lance Smith lead the Bulldogs down the field and scored on a 25 yard run. That score would finalize a Rams 42-14 win. The loss put the Bulldogs at 0-6 thus far in the season. This Friday, the Bulldogs travel to Watson Chapel as they take on their cross-town rival the Wildcats at 7 p.m. By Brice Hoffmanfor the White Hall Journal The   By Brice Hoffmanfor the White Hall Journal Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 1:02 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:20:31.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
