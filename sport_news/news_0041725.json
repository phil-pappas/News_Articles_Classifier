The game started off quickly, with senior Nick Cufari playing a penetrating ball to a slashing John Mozrall, who was fouled inside the box for a penalty kick. Senior Matt Kaiser stepped up and buried the ball into the back of the net for a quick 1-0 lead. Brighton wouldn’t go down easily and tied the score at 1-1, but the Knights continued to battle. The second half saw some good ball movement from the Knights, who are starting to get healthy again at the right time of the season. Jack Ward played a blistering cross, which found the head of John O’Neill and then the back of the Brighton net, but the Knights weren’t satisfied. Jack Ramsager made an ankle-breaking move on the Brighton defender, went around him and played a low hard cross, which hit the defender and found the back of the net for an own goal, which was credited to Jack, ending the game with a 3-1 victory. The Knights faced another tough league opponent they recently just beat in overtime at a hostile Honeoye Falls-Lima field. This time, the Knights would get a chance on their own turf, but the HFL fans came out in full force and kept their chants on a continual roar. This wouldn’t have an impact on the Knights, as they started off the game like they finished it last time. Great midfield composure and ball movement orchestrated by seniors Nick Cufari and Ryan Gross. They were able to move the ball side to side, and after a combination play between Jack Ward and Jack Ramsager, Ramsager finished the play with a precision shot to the far post, beating the HFL keeper for a 1-0 lead just a few minutes in. Once again, HFL wasn’t interested in just giving up, even though they came into the game on a five-game winless streak. They were able to tie up the game on a penalty kick which saw the Sutherland keeper, in his attempt to stop the shot, injure his shoulder and leave the game. HFL then broke in on the Sutherland goal, which saw junior keeper Brian Roser come out to slide the ball away, only to be penalized just outside the box and given a yellow card, which meant he had to leave the pitch momentarily. Now Sutherland was forced into another goalie change, which saw senior CJ Gaffney get between the pipes to face a HFL free kick from just outside the box and straight on. Fortunately for the Knights, the shot hit the wall, then the rebound would drift aimlessly wide. HFL would get a go-ahead goal, but then Ramsager once again moved around their outside defender and was able to get off a shot once again, beating the HFL keeper for his second of the night. Page 2 of 2 - With just a few minutes remaining in the first overtime, a poor clearance from the HFL defense saw the ball roll to senior Matt Kaiser about 40 yards from the goal, who hit a shot into the upper corner of the HFL net to send the Knights off to another sudden victory. Sutherland will face Mendon at 7 p.m. Oct. 9 on the Sutherland turf.
