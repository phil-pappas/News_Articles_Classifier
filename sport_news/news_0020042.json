More >> MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) - \nMemphis and Ole Miss square off Saturday, and fans cannot contain their excitement for the Tigers’ biggest game of the season. \nInside the Tiger Bookstore, it was obvious it is a big week for Memphis fans. \n\"We've just got another flag. We are excited,” said Ashley Markham. \nOle Miss fans are no less excited, with many already in the Bluff City. \n\"With Oxford only being an hour and half, two hours away, a lot of their fans will be here. A lot of them are already in Memphis, so it's really just battling it out from the get go,\" Markham said. \nWith the undefeated Tigers taking on a big rival, the excitement is high, with some types tickets already being sold out. \n\"I think it's awesome,” Memphis student Drew Webb said. “I think it's really cool how Memphis had brought their game up in the last season or so. So going into this game undefeated really shows them what we're all about.\" \nOn campus, students have been talking about the game since Monday, when their tickets sold out. Some tickets are still available, but are limited to the upper bowl. None of them are being sold for less than $50. \n\"It's going to be hype and it's going to be loud and it's going to be good,” Memphis student John Mikeal said. \nWebsites like StubHub have better seats available, but only if you are willing to fork over as much as $224 per ticket. \nStudents like Zach Tucker said it is all about the atmosphere on Tiger Lane and the energy in the Liberty Bowl. \n\"I think it will be insane, very similar to when Grizzlies get into the playoffs, in that Memphis fans will just go berserk,” Tucker said. \nTailgating spots open at 5 a.m. Saturday.
