It's a privilege. It's what gets you up in the morning, so I'm very proud to play. \n\"But I think it'll be the manager of the national side who will decide when I don't play - not me.\" \nThe vast majority of the 12,401 fans inside the Estadio Algarve were Scottish and they gave Strachan and his players some rousing backing throughout the predictably one-sided encounter against UEFA's newest members, who finished their qualifying programme with 56 goals against in 10 matches. \nAfter a Steven Fletcher hat-trick and goals from Maloney, Chris Martin and substitute Steven Naismith confirmed a fourth-place finish, the Scotland squad, management team and backroom staff assembled on the pitch for a group photograph. \nStrachan's side missed out on a play-off spot to the Republic of Ireland by three points, with Germany and Poland qualifying automatically for next summer's finals in France. \nMaloney reflected on the 1-0 defeat in Georgia in September, noting it as the most damaging result of the campaign. \nThe former Celtic, Aston Villa and Wigan player said: \"We have to look at the recent game in Georgia as obviously a huge result. It was a huge knock-back. \n\"I think that result put us in a very difficult situation. It meant we had to rely on other teams and Ireland have proved what a good side they've been when they beat Germany. \n\"That's why we find ourselves in the situation we're in.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:01:00.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
