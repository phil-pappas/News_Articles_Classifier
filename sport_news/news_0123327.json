Tukuafu also had four snaps on defense, playing on the line. — A high concentration of snaps in the team’s primary defenders with six playing every snap, Cary Williams all but one in which he left due to injury, and two others 80 percent or more. Some national analysts wondered last week if the Seahawks were getting away from their philosophy of being fairly basic and straight-up on defense. The snap counts would indicate that if they had, they got back to their usual ways last night. Recall that the Seahawks also had high snap count percentages for their main defensive players during the six-game winning streak that ended last season. (As Eric Branch noted , the Seahawks got five of their six sacks out of a four-man rush). — Alvin Bailey with 24 snaps and Gary Gilliam with 52 as the two rotated at right tackle (with Bailey also getting one snap at left tackle when Russell Okung missed one play and a couple more as an extra tackle). That was done largely due to Gilliam’s ankle injury. — DeShawn Shead with 20 snaps which amounted to 19 in the nickel and then one when he filled in for Williams when Williams was hurt for a play — probably as little nickel as the Seahawks have played this season.
