Their 65-loss campaign last season was, statistically speaking, the worst in the organization’s history—which dates all the way back to the 1940s.\nBut even though the Knicks stunk worse than Pepé Le Pew in a sauna a year ago, fans remained loyal. New York’s average attendance of 19,812 ranked No. 4 in the NBA a season ago and was actually up from the year prior. So will that dedicated fan base be rewarded for its dependability with a winning season in 2015-16?\nIn order for the Big Apple to turn its basketball fortunes around—or at least vastly outperform the 17-win kerfuffle in Derek Fisher ’s first season as head coach— Carmelo Anthony , who missed half of last season, will need to be the catalyst for success.\nProvided that the Knicks won just 17 games, it’s logical to conclude that Melo had a down year. But in actuality, Anthony’s production was still quite good. He averaged 24.2 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists per contest. His three-point shooting percentage dipped to 34.1%, which was his lowest mark since 2009-10 when he was still in Denver. However, that can be attributed to the fact that Anthony was nursing a knee injury all season and eventually opted to have surgery in February—limiting his season to 40 games.\nThough he played on a hobbled leg for an unproven coach and with an uninspired supporting cast, Melo’s offensive acumen still shined through. He finished sixth in points per game among all NBA players despite a multitude of factors working against him.\nThere’s still a lot of pressure on Anthony’s shoulders to perform, especially with four years remaining on a five-year, $124 million deal he signed two summers ago. But thanks to a savvy, under-the-radar off-season put together by president of basketball operations Phil Jackson, New York's alpha dog now has an intriguing supporting cast.\nNBA Video Roundtable: Which NBA star is under the most pressure this season? by SI.com Staff", "external_links": ["https://w.graphiq.com/w/3jCcHUsbfrT", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/2f4TGvWh2IZ", "http://twitter.com/@BenLebo", "http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2015"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:50:14.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
