Beyond the race for No. 1, the biggest story in this week's re-ranking can be found from members of the Group of Five. Four non-major programs sit inside the top 25, led by No. 12 Memphis, which soared into the championship mix after beating Mississippi. The Tigers are followed by No. 18 Temple, No. 22 Toledo and No. 23 Houston.\nIt's enough to offset Boise State's tumble. The Broncos were swamped by Utah State, 52-26, in a loss that should cost Bryan Harsin's team not just an access-bowl berth but a Mountain West Conference championship.\nNew to the top 25: Houston and Duke.\nOut of the top 25: Boise State and UCLA.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768715971618409-football-four-promo2.jpg", "http://footballfour.usatoday.com/", "http://imgur.com/1tXaIyp.png"], "published": "2015-10-19T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:33:47.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
