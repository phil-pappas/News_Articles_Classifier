Back | Next Ben Brengman/For the Savannah Morning News\nSavannah State’s Marquis Smith and Connor Christian sack NCCU quarterback Malcolm Bell in the first half.\nBy Donald Heath\nFor 15 minutes Saturday afternoon, the Savannah State Tigers gave their alumni and fans every reason to be happy on homecoming.\nThe Tigers saw everything go right while building a 22-point lead, only to have resilient North Carolina Central spoil their party.\nThe Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference defending champion Eagles stormed back to rain on SSU’s parade 39-22 at T.A. Wright Stadium.\n“Instead of coming together, we kind of separated,” Tigers linebacker Marquis Smith said. “We gave up at the end. We just didn’t have the confidence we had in the first half.”\nIt was a difficult loss to swallow for SSU, which had gotten the better of play against a team that finished as one of five league co-champions a year ago.\nQuarterback Arshon Spaulding ran for 133 yards (130 in the first quarter) and a touchdown, and running back Joshua Berry ran for two scores.\nThe Tiger offense produced 300 yards — just 13 fewer than its season-high 313 against Morgan State a week ago.\n“When you watch their tapes, you can see them improving every week,” NCCU coach Jerry Mack said. “Then they come out in that first quarter … But football is a game of momentum, and our team is proof of that.”\nA week ago, Central (3-3, 2-1 MEAC) rallied for 10 points in the fourth quarter to beat Florida A&M 27-24.\nThe Eagles gained the momentum by cutting SSU’s lead with 15 points in the second quarter. They tied the game on the first possession of the third quarter and took the lead on Nigel Macauley’s third field goal of the game before pulling away.\nSSU coach Earnest Wilson III said his team’s youth and a lack of experience and strength showed.\nIt also said something about Central, a natural rival of SSU because the two schools began play in the MEAC the same year, 2011.\n“They showed a certain maturity,” Wilson said.\nJunior quarterback Malcolm Bell led the way with two touchdown passes in the second half. His 35-yarder to David Miller tied the game at 22 with 11:57 left in the third quarter, and Macauley’s 30-yard field goal about three minutes later put the Eagles ahead for good.\nThe NCCU defense, gouged for 189 yards in the first quarter, allowed only 111 the rest of the way.\n“Our team showed character,” Mack said. “Those last three quarters, we tightened up.”\nGreat start\nThe first half had a little bit of everything. SSU jumped out to a great start. Central fought back and got back in the game in the second quarter.\nHomecoming had an impact as well. Music from a nearby event somehow infiltrated the stadium speakers and played for about half the first quarter.\nSSU couldn’t turn off the music and was eventually flagged for a delay of game penalty.\nCentral couldn’t turn off the Tigers’ offense in the early going, and SSU built a 22-0 advantage. Spaulding’s 54-yard scramble highlighted a seven-play, 90-yard drive that culminated in Berry’s 10-yard TD run to open the scoring.\nOn the ensuing kickoff, Smith tackled indecisive returner Jonathan Williams in the end zone for a safety, and the lead increased to 9-0.\nThings only got worse for the visitors from Durham, N.C. Bell, who entered the game ninth in NCCU career total offense (3,573 yards), suffered two interceptions — one ending an Eagle drive that had reached SSU territory, and the other setting up a Tiger score.\nSpaulding didn’t need the help. He went 77 yards in two plays, running 16 yards on the first, before going the final 61 yards for a touchdown on the second play to make it 16-0.\nSeventy-nine seconds later, after Smith’s interception, Berry found running room on the left side and went 26 yards for his second touchdown for a 22-0 lead.\nBut the advantage disappeared faster than grilled burgers outside the stadium. Bell ran for a score, Macauley kicked two field goals and a safety — all in the second quarter — made it 22-15 as the half ended.\nAfter producing 189 first-quarter yards, the Tigers had a minus-7 yards in the second quarter.\n“We just got relaxed and got away from the game plan,” Spaulding said. “We started good, but that vibe wasn’t there after halftime. We have to have that fight the whole game.”\nNC Central 0 15 17 7—39\nSavannah St. 22 0 0 0—22\nFirst Quarter\nSav—Berry 10 run (Barron kick), 11:26.\nSav—Safety, 11:24.\nSav—Spaulding Jr. 61 run (Barron kick), 2:39.\nSav—Berry 26 run (run failed), 1:20.\nSecond Quarter\nNCCe—Bell 3 run (Macauley kick), 12:59.\nNCCe—FG Macauley 30, 6:15.\nNCCe—Safety, 1:58.\nNCCe—FG Macauley 35, :30.\nThird Quarter\nNCCe—Miller 35 pass from Bell (Macauley kick), 11:57.\nNCCe—FG Macauley 30, 8:55.\nNCCe—Lanier 8 pass from Bell (Macauley kick), 5:03.\nFourth Quarter\nNCCe—Simpson 1 run (Macauley kick), 7:33.\nA—5,649.\nNCCU Sav\nFirst downs 26 14\nRushes-yards 50-291 31-170\nPassing 142 130\nComp-Att-Int 11-29-2 15-26-0\nReturn Yards 27 35\nPunts-Avg. 3-32.0 7-25.1\nFumbles-Lost 0-0 3-1\nPenalties-Yards 9-98 11-88\nTime of Possession 34:15 25:45\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING—NC Central, McClain 18-135, Bell 15-92, Simpson 14-54, Billerman 1-5, K.Thompson 2-5.
