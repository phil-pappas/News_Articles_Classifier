Comment By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 9:00 PM By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 9:00 PM HOPKINTON — It wasn’t easy, but it needed to be done. The Hopkinton boys soccer team desperately needed a victory to keep its postseason hopes alive, and played with a sense of urgency against visiting Tri-Valley League rival Holliston on Wednesday afternoon. The Hillers pressured Panthers goalie Jacob Obid throughout the contest, but the junior keeper was up to the task and stopped the first nine shot he faced. And then, with 11:15 remaining, everything changed. Hopkinton’s Ben Fargiano was able to head the ball past Obid and into the net, giving the Hillers a 1-0 victory. “He was definitely a good goalie,” Fargiano said of Obid. “He had good hands, but when it came down to it we finished the chance that mattered the most. We definitely could’ve had a couple more because we had a couple breakaways, but that’s something we’ll just have to work on to improve going forward.” Sophomore Dan Palleiko assisted on the game’s only score, launching a free kick inside the 18-yard box from 10 yards inside of midfield. With his body facing toward Palleiko, Fargiano headed the ball over his shoulder and inside the Panthers’ left post. “I just tried to flick it at the back post and hoped it’d go in,” said Fargiano. “It was awesome. I heard everybody yelling and knew it must have made its way in.” While the junior’s much-needed goal was enough to beat Holliston, it also keeps Hopkinton’s playoff hopes alive. The Hillers, who are now 5-8-2 overall and 5-7-2 in the TVL, entered Wednesday’s game knowing they must win their final four games. Fargiano’s heroics ensured the team’s aspirations of reaching the tournament will remain intact. “I thought our guys rose to the occasion,” Hopkinton coach Garrett Sawyer said. “They played the type of game we needed to in order to keep our postseason hopes alive. I think all of the chances we were able to create were a testament to how well we were playing all over the field. Usually when you do that one will eventually go in.” Even though Holliston (9-2-4, 9-2-4 TVL) forced Hopkinton senior goalkeeper Tom Onsi to make six saves of his own, the Hillers looked like the hungrier team from the outset. Ryan Wolfe nearly scored for Hopkinton in the opening minutes of the second half, though he couldn’t finish at the left post following a perfectly placed crossing pass from Ryan DiNicola. Only moments before Fargiano found the back of the net, Obid robbed junior Ryan Mastroianni of a goal on a breakaway. Mastroianni snuck past the Panthers defense after receiving a through-ball from sophomore Connor Delaney, but Obid met the junior inside the box to stop the initial offering and rebound thereafter. Page 2 of 2 - “(Obid) has played great for us all year; he comes up with big saves,” Holliston coach Jay Dupuis said. “Unfortunately, we just didn’t do anything to help him today. When you only give up one goal, you should win. Hopkinton was just the better team today, they brought it for 80 minutes.” Although Holliston may have had fewer scoring chances than the Hillers, the Panthers’ missed opportunities were equally maddening. Midway through the second half, senior Jack O’Neill almost finished off an impressive through-ball from junior Kyle Papulis, but Onsi was there for a save at Hopkinton’s right post. Papulis and O’Neill were a part of another failed chance when Papulis sent the Panthers’ first of six corner kicks into the Hillers’ box early in the first half. The ball landed at O’Neill’s feet 10 yards in front of Onsi before popping free to where freshman Jonathan Paecht was standing 18 yards out. Despite getting off a good shot, Paecht’s attempt went over Hopkinton’s net for a Hillers goal kick. While his team struggled to put one past Obid for much of the afternoon, Sawyer said the Hillers didn’t need any extra motivation to keep rifling shots on goal. “They’ve been fired up for this game, so I didn’t really to motivate them to stay positive,” the coach said. “They were confident all the way through. They know that we’re capable of playing well enough to win against anybody.” By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By Brad Joyal/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 9:00 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:23:36.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
