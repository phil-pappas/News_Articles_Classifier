You've got to have a short memory in football. The only thing that matters is the next play and the next game.\"\nThe Eagles (4-2, 2-2 SAC) wasted no time forgetting their 52-17 loss to Lenoir-Rhyne last week. On Saturday, C-N started fast, with running back Damian Baker taking a pitch on the first play from scrimmage and raced 69 yards down and across the field after cutting back in from the sideline.\nFor the first time this season, Baker didn't eclipse 100 yards rushing, but it wasn't from a lack of effectiveness. Against Brevard (0-6, 0-3), the Eagles rotated two full offensive and defensive units until the fourth quarter, when they began emptying the bench. Baker carried the ball just six times for 88 yards.\n\"This is the first ball game we've had where we had the advantage in all three (phases of the game),\" C-N coach Ken Sparks said. \"Brevard fights like crazy. We couldn't get off the field a few times when we needed to (on defense). They had the ball for 35 minutes. They just kept running it at us and that's been a woe for us this year.\"\nBut the time of possession may have had more to do with the effectiveness of Carson-Newman's offense. On the first play of its second possession, No. 2 quarterback Noah Suber hit No. 3 wide receiver Lonnie Williams for a 53-yard touchdown strike. Before the game was four minutes old, the Eagles led 14-0 and had used 22 different offensive players.\nOver the last few games, cornerback Jason Williams has emerged as a force on defense, swatting away passes against Mars Hill two weeks ago and again Saturday. Against the Tornadoes, he blocked a punt and picked up a sack while Brevard quarterback Tyler Gregory was rolling out of the pocket.\n\"I'm trying to establish myself as a playmaker and leader for my team,\" Williams said. \"I have to make plays when I get the chance to. We knew what kind of game this was. We wanted to rebound from last week and play hard all four quarters. Brevard is a scrappy team and we knew they'd come in with a chip on their shoulder.\"\nIt was a big day for C-N defenders down the depth chart. Reserve linebacker Darius Morris made a game-high 12 tackles, one for a loss. In all, the Eagles recorded nine tackles for loss and four sacks against Brevard, which completed only two passes against C-N's defense. Eien Jacob picked off a pass and Justin Long recorded 1.5 sacks to go with six tackles despite switching out every other Tornadoes offensive possession.\nThe Eagles held Brevard to 216 yards of offense.\nPlaying his first significant action of the season, Suber was a standout for C-N. He completed all five of his pass attempts for 100 yards and a touchdown and carried the ball 12 times for 104 yards and two touchdowns.\nLinebacker Jason Nieradka led the Tornadoes with 11 tackles.\nAdam Greene is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:56:10.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
