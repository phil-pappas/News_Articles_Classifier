(AP) — Prosecutors say former Michigan State University basketball star and television analyst Mateen Cleaves is the subject of a sexual assault investigation but has not been charged. \nWayne County prosecutor’s office spokesman Maria Miller confirmed Friday to The Flint Journal (http://bit.ly/1R2ovpc ) that the investigation was transferred to Detroit from Genesee County. \nGenesee County Prosecutor David Leyton says he decided not to investigate the case because his “family has a relationship with a witness.” \nDetails of the case were not released Friday. \nCleaves’ attorney Frank Manley tells the newspaper the complaint is a “private matter.” \nCleaves attended Flint Northern High School, led Michigan State to the men’s NCAA basketball championship in 2000 and played in the NBA. \nThe Associated Press left a message Friday night seeking comment from Manley.
