Meyersdale capitalizes on nine turnovers By ADAM RIPPLE aripple@dailyamerican.com dailyamerican.com | 0 comments \nCAIRNBROOK — The Meyersdale Red Raiders were looking to rebound from two straight home losses when they traveled to Shade High School to take on Windber Saturday night. \nThe Red Raiders took advantage of nine Windber turnovers to get back into the win column with a 53-14 victory over the Ramblers. \n“We capitalized on turnovers and we need to do that, it’s part of the game,” Meyersdale coach Mike Swank said. \nMeyersdale began the game with the football. However, the Red Raiders, who have been plagued by turnovers throughout the season, gave the ball to the Ramblers on a Trevor Thomas interception. \nFollowing the turnover, Windber appeared to be in position to score with the football at the Meyersdale 21 yard line. Yet, the Ramblers gave the football back to the Red Raiders when a Shadoe Smith pitch could not be corralled. Hunter Day scooped up the loose ball and raced to the Windber 35. One play later, Christian Hutzell ran over would-be tacklers for a touchdown. The Riley Christner extra point was good and the Red Raiders led 7-0. \nOn Windber’s first play from scrimmage on its next series, the Ramblers again fumbled the football. \nMeyersdale was quick to profit from the miscue. Day capped a six play drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. The Red Raiders led 14-0 with 4:11 left in the first quarter. \nThe Ramblers went three-and-out on their next series. \nFollowing a 20-yard punt, the Red Raiders needed only one play to add to their lead. Thomas found a streaking Kyle Sigler down the sideline for a 28-yard touchdown pass. \nMeyersdale held a 21-0 lead after one quarter of play. \nWindber cut into the Meyersdale lead on its first possession of the second quarter. Smith, with an extra effort, bursted through the Meyersdale line and dashed 56 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. Kelsey Buza added the extra point and Windber trailed 21-7. \nMeyersdale was quick to respond. Thomas took the ensuing kickoff 79 yards to the Windber 19 yard line. A play later, Hutzell scored his second touchdown of the game on a 19-yard run. The Red Raiders led 28-7 with 9:27 left in the first half. \nWindber strung together a seven-play drive down to the Meyersdale 38, but Smith fumbled the football and the Red Raiders recovered. It was the Ramblers’ fourth turnover of the first half. \nSmith made up for the fumble when he intercepted Thomas two plays later. However, Windber quickly turned the football over to the Red Raiders. \nMeyersdale took advantage of the fumble to raise their lead to 34-7. Thomas finished an 11-play drive with a 4-yard touchdown run on fourth-and-three with 32 seconds left in the half. \nMeyersdale took that lead into the locker room. \nWindber was plagued by two more turnovers in a fast-moving third quarter. Meyersdale marched down to the Windber one yard line in the latter stages of the quarter, before time ran out. \nOn fourth-and-goal from the Windber one yard line, Thomas called his own number to give Meyersdale a 40-7 lead to begin the fourth quarter. \nEach team then turned the football over twice. \nSmith scored his second touchdown of the game on a 40-yard run. The Ramblers trailed 40-14 with 6:30 left in the game. Smith finished the game with 213 yards rushing. \n“We talked about how we are young and inexperienced, but the one thing we haven’t done as a team is turn the ball over this year,” Windber coach Matt Grohal said. \nMeyersdale finished the scoring with back-to-back touchdowns. Jacob Krause scored on a 66-yard touchdown run and Austin Minnick found the end zone on a 65-yard jaunt, following a Windber punt. \nMeyersdale (4-2) will host Berlin in the “Backyard Brawl” next Friday, while Windber (1-5) will travel to Conemaugh Valley on Saturday.
