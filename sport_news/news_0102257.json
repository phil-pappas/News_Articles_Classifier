Utah video: Homecoming week pep rally, Paul ready to 'bear hunt' “ Every game is big. No game is bigger than another. They’re all the same.”\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham\nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah coach Kyle Whittingham didn’t break from his trademark resolve when asked about Saturday’s home game against California.\n“Business as usual,” he said.\nThis game, though, is different — at least when it comes to pomp and circumstance.\nThere’s plenty of them.\nBoth Pac-12 teams are undefeated and ranked. The Utes (4-0, 1-0) and Golden Bears (5-0, 2-0) are No. 5 and No. 23, respectively, in this week’s AP Top 25. ESPN’s “College GameDay” program is in town — setting up shop in Presidents Circle — and it’s homecoming up on the hill. Throwback jerseys and a new playing surface at the stadium add to the excitement.\nDespite it all, as well as early national media talk about Utah going on to win the Pac-12 and earn a spot in the College Football Playoff, Whittingham is maintaining his usual stance.\n“Every game is big,” he said. “No game is bigger than another. They’re all the same.”\nUtah’s players back the approach.\n“We’ve just got to take it one game at a time, go out there and do our job,” said senior running back Devontae Booker.\nThe Utes have won six straight games dating back to last season and drew a lot of national acclaim for a 62-20 victory at Oregon two weeks ago. Even so, Booker doesn’t view things differently.\n“I kind of look at it as we’re still the underdog. It doesn’t matter if we’re No. 5 or whatever ranked we are,\" he said. “We’ve still got to go out there and win games and do our job if we want to be the best and win it all.”\nSenior linebacker Jared Norris explained that the Utes need to take each week for what it is and execute.\n“We’ve got to play at the highest level of football that we can. It doesn’t matter if we’re playing Cal, it doesn’t matter if we’re playing Alabama,” he said. “We have to come and bring it — not just on Saturdays but every day at practice.”\nNorris emphasized the importance of preparation. It’s accompanied by focus on the task at hand.\nSenior wide receiver Kenneth Scott constantly reminds teammates that by the same token praise is given, there can be criticism and treatment at the bottom of the barrel.\n“So that just helps you keep it balanced and be even-keeled — not get too high, not get too low,” Scott said. “And make sure you keep your eye on the prize and not let it slip by you.”\nUtah is determined to combat any complacency, especially after a bye week. Senior quarterback Travis Wilson said the team is eager to get back on the field again. All attention is on Cal, he explained, and no one is worried about things like rankings or playoffs.\n“We’re just trying to keep this streak going and make sure we just stay consistent and just stay on the right paths with everything,” he said.\nScott thinks the team is doing a good job in that regard. He doesn’t think the team is letting all the hype associated with the rise in the rankings get to them.\nWhittingham put it in perspective.\n“It’s almost like living in a biosphere or dome. You’ve got people tapping on the glass and looking in at you,” he said. “You’ve just got to block it out. You’ve just got to go about your business and not let it affect you because it can be a distraction.”\nEXTRA POINTS: Utah and Cal are two of nine teams currently in the Top 25 that opened the season unranked. ...
