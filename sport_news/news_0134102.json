Only with that can he be in a position to have a great season. \n\"In the past it has not been because he dropped in form it's because he was injured. \n\"Step number one, he has made it, he has had a good pre-season, even it was after the season already started, he is now fit. \n\"The quality was never in doubt, the problem was fitness and without that you can't have form.\" \nCarroll came off the bench in West Ham's 2-2 draw against Norwich last Saturday but raised concern after taking a heavy challenge on his ankle. \nA scan has shown no serious damage, however, and the fearless 26-year-old is expected to be available for Saturday's trip to struggling Sunderland. \n\"You don't want to take it away from him, that's why he is Andy Carroll,\" Bilic said. \n\"It's his biggest enemy but also his biggest quality, that he rolls up his sleeves and he goes straight in the box, gives the centre half and goalkeeper a bit of a strange look - that's why he's like that. \n\"You want to moderate that a little bit, maybe 10 per cent, tell him not to go for those crazy challenges, but you don't want to take that away because then he would be half the player.\" \nCarroll may have to work hard to re-establish himself in the West Ham side given they have scored the highest number of goals in the division so far this season. \nFellow forward Enner Valencia also returned to light training on Thursday after injuring his knee against Astra Giurgiu in July. \n\"Enner is great news for us,\" Bilic said. \n\"It's a matter of two or three weeks now if everything goes well. He's a naturally fit player.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:37:11.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
