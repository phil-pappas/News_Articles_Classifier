(Photo: Courtesy of Delta State sports) \nFlorida Tech is well aware of just how good Tyler Sullivan can be. \nThe Delta State quarterback threw for 456 yards and five touchdowns last season as the Statesmen rolled to a 38-point win over the Panthers. That was at home. Saturday night the Panthers will travel to Delta State for a Gulf South Conference matchup on ESPN3 as the Florida's Space Coast GSC-TV game of the week. \n“We know what Delta State is, obviously we have seen them the last couple of years,” Florida Tech football coach Steve Englehart said. “They have as good a quarterback and receivers as we are going to see.” \nSullivan has already thrown for 1,302 yards and 10 touchdowns in the first four games and has been the Gulf South Conference player of the week twice. \n“He is a smart kid, played a lot of football and delivers the ball well,” Florida Tech football coach Steve Englehart said. “You are going to have to try to mix some things up, can’t just sit in one defense.” \nAs well as Sullivan played last season, becoming a Harlon Hill National Trophy finalist, he may be playing even better this season. The redshirt junior is a big reason the Statesmen head into Saturday night’s game with the Panthers as the No. 5 team in the country. \nSullivan had his best game in Week 2 against Texas A&M-Commerce where he threw for 491 yards and three touchdowns. Last week against Albany State was the first game that Sullivan did not throw three touchdowns in a game and has completed more than 60 percent of his passes in each game. \n“When it is going, it is a beautiful thing,” Delta State football coach Todd Cooley said of his offense. “We have seen it in our offense, we go three and out … we are not really concerned with that as long as we find a rhythm.” \nThe offense has been able to find that rhythm in the first four games of the season, outscoring opponents 190-69. And Tyler Sullivan has been right in the middle of it. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1FF29cD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:36:41.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
