Sponsored by RGJ file Civic nicknames \nThe best part about civic nicknames is feeling like an insider. \"Our nickname is because we're the City of Roses ... you wouldn't get that as a non-Portlandian.\" \nExamples: Chicago Fire (Chicago, IL); Portland Thorns (Portland, OR) \nOur suggestion: B.L.C.F.C. Getty Images Neighborhoods and suburbs \nFor the sake of civic pride, it's ideal to get your hometown somewhere in your name. If you're in a city like London (40-plus teams), it starts to make sense to name teams after neighborhoods instead. \nExamples: Rosenborg BK (Trondheim, Norway); Aston Villa (Birmingham, England) \nOur suggestion: Riverwalk F.C.; Old Brewery District F.C. Lisa J. Tolda/RGJ Years \nYears figure prominently in soccer team names throughout Europe, though they're generally drawn from the team's founding year (and let's face it, it's going to take decades for \"Reno 2017\" to sound cool.) Maybe we pick another significant year? \nExamples: Vancouver 86ers (Vancouver, B.C.); 1860 München (Munich, Germany) \nOur suggestions: City of Reno 1868; Nevada 1864 Plants \nIf you're looking to emphasize the action and excitement of soccer, nothing says \"dynamic\" quite like plants. \nExamples: Linlithgow Rose F.C.

(Accra, Ghana) \nOur suggestion: Nevada Sagebrush Andy Barron/RGJ Authority \nThe Spanish royal family has bestowed the word \"real\" (\"royal\") on several soccer teams, and a handful of teams not living under monarchies use it as well (though we're not quite sure why).

Thinkstock Youth \nWhy not name your team after young people? Anyone who has the energy to run around for 45 solid minutes surely has some youthful energy. \nExamples: Juventus F.C. (Turin, Italy); Boca Juniors (Buenos Aires, Argentina); Wexford Youths (Crossabeg, Ireland) \nOur suggestion: Reno Millennials F.C. Marilyn Newton/RGJ Unity \nIf the soccer team is going to be a success, it will need to draw from throughout the region, not just within the Reno city limits.
