We need to work hard. There aren’t any divisions in the national team dressing room, and I don’t have issues with any of the Egyptian Premier League managers. \n\"I have talked with Ferreira and Garrido. I’ve coordinated with Hossam El Badry to avoid clashes over player selections.” \nCuper further spoke of the passion amongst the fan base. \n“People in Egypt adore football. I was surprised; I knew that this was the case in Argentina, Italy, Greece, and Turkey, but this was a surprise to me. \n\"This is all in spite of the empty stands. I thank football for introducing me to this country.” \n“I’ve never felt like a foreigner here, even though I don’t speak the language. Arabic is a very difficult language, but Egyptians are a very helpful people. I’ve seen it firsthand. There’s a lot of love everywhere,\" he went on. \nEgypt will play two friendlies against Senegal and Zambia on October 8 and 11, same days Nigeria will take on Congo and Cameroon respectively in Brussels .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:23:05.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
