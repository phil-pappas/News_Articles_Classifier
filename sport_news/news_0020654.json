From the outside, it’s easy to say that this is Jim Christian’s program now with his recruits and his handpicked players trying to dig out of the bottom third of the ACC.\n“We just got to keep teaching from our base,” Christian said after practice on Tuesday before giving his team two days off. “We’ve got good young guys and I’m happy with that. We just got to keep getting better.”\nThe Eagles are in the position where they need their youth to step up quickly. Last season, Christian inherited one of the oldest rosters in college basketball. This year, he has freshmen taking up more than 75 percent of his roster, and those players need to fill major minutes. He said that patience, especially on the practice floor, will be key for this young team, even if he sees the same mistakes over and over again.\n“Young players are young players. The difference here is that we have to count on our young players,” he said. “We’ve got to hold them a little more accountable. Most programs you’ve got young guys and they make some mistakes and they learn from the older guys. We don’t have that. We don’t have that luxury. We have to understand that it’s going to pay dividends for us down the road. I think this will be a team that continually gets better as the season goes on because of that. But it just is what it is.”\n--\nEli Carter, a graduate transfer from Florida, looked like he will fill the role of Olivier Hanlan as the true playmaker of the team while Jerome Robinson and other younger players get acclimated to the system. Carter showed some good passing ability off of screens and had a nice two-man game working with Clifford several times in Tuesday’s session.\n“He’s really good. He’s got different gears,” Christian said of Carter. “He can play the game at different speeds pretty well and he’s learning.”\n--\nHealth will be key for the Eagles because last year behind Hanlan, Dmitri Batten, and Aaron Brown there really wasn’t much to rely on. Hicks has been a full participant since the Eagles arrived back on campus, according to Christian, and he took a lot of reps in Tuesday’s session. Hicks, a 6-foot-2, sophomore, has missed two seasons due to ACL injuries to his left knee. Christian said he is moving well, but that he’s got a long way to go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:17:23.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
