South Caldwell is 7-0, led by their three running backs Tyler Goins, Cameron Wright, and Caleb Starnes, while quarterback Jenson Weaver gets it done on the ground as well. Miller Kirkpatrick is the leader for the defense, already posting 9.0 tackles for loss. They will need him to stop one of the top running backs in North Carolina in BJ Emmons for Franklin. Lee County vs Grays Creek Game Preview: Lees County is coming off back to back tough losses, last week against a good Terry Sanford team. They have to get back on track but will have to do it on the road against Grays Creek. Grays Creek is averaging over 300 yards on the ground, as senior running backs Calvin Boyd and Leyland McDonald lead the way, both averaging around 130 ypg. North Henderson vs Franklin Game Preview: North Henderson and Franklin, two teams at 5-2, meet up Friday night for a Western North Carolina Conference showdown. Both are near the top of the division, with four teams standing at 5-2 overall. Last year, Franklin took apart North Henderson 49-14 but Trevor Craft has been terrific this year for North Henderson, averaging 216 yards per game. Franklin is on a three game winning streak and hopes to take their momentum into a strong finish this season. Southern Guilford vs Asheboro Game Preview: After two early losses, Southern Guilford's offense has been clicking behind quarterback Rayshawn Knight and running back Amon Harris. Their defense also has been strong as well in their five game win streak. Asheboro though could be another story, as they two have had a strong defense this season. This could be the determining game in the Mid-Piedmont conference, as both sit undefeated in the conference heading into the game.
