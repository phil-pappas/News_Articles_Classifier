They even had a flair for the dramatic. Down 1-0 late in the first half, Marshwood tied up the game on Taylor Gilbert's goal with 15 seconds to play before intermission. \"That goal at the end of the half really sparked them,\" said Marshwood coach Lisa Truesdale. \"From there we started to play the game we were hoping (to play).\" In this case, the Hawks played just well enough to win and move on. Freshman Leah Glidden scored the game-winner 12:37 into the second half from a nifty crossing pass by Hannah Costin. Costin also assisted on the first goal. It stood up, although the Hawks had multiple chances to add to that lead. They then withstood a minor push in the final two minutes by Gorham. The Hawks (11-3-1) advance to Wednesday's quarterfinal game at No. 3 Thornton Academy (12-2-0), starting at 6:30 p.m. TA beat Marshwood in the season finale this past Tuesday, 1-0. But the Hawks, who beat Gorham 3-0 on Sept. 18, had to work extra hard for this one. The Rams took a surprisingly quick 1-0 lead 5:15 into the game, scoring off a penalty corner. Jamie Juskiewicz rattled the ball into the left corner from Erin Esty's pass. \"We got off to a very stale start,\" Truesdale said. \"They were hesitant to the ball. It wasn't like them at all.\" Marshwood gradually found its legs and was able to work its way back into control of the game. The Hawks' early struggles could be partially linked to a false fire alarm at school that disrupted the team's pregame routine, preventing them from getting to their own field in a timely fashion before Gorham. Marshwood, after two early penalty corners by Gorham, exerted its own pressure and that led to Gilbert's late goal on a shot by Costin from the left of the cage. \"I was on weak-side post and I just saw it coming,\" said Gilbert, who punched it in. \"It was a need. We knew we needed it.\" It was a deflating moment for the Rams. \"We got a little more defensive minded there,\" said Gorham coach Becky Manson-Rioux. \"You got them pounding on us the last six minutes of that half, I thought. There is only so much your defense can do. But 15 seconds ... \" Glidden then made it 2-1 with the only goal of the second half, one-timing Costin's pass from the right wing. \"It means everything if we can just make it to states. This is the first step to there, so I just took a whack and it happened,\" Glidden said. \"When I was coming down, there was an open space near the post. Hannah (Costin) had the ball and she looked up at me, and we kind of made eye contact. I could tell she was going to do it, so I got low and it came to me.\" Marshwood ended up with nine penalty corners to two for Gorham (4-10-1). The Hawks continued to control possession and pressured in the circle, but could not get an insurance goal, despite good opportunities by Costin, Claudia Folger, Elaine Bachelder and Melanie Dube. Marshwood has advanced to at least the regional semis in each of the last four years, and would need a win Wednesday at TA to keep that streak alive. Last year, the Hawks lost in the regional final to Scarborough.
