(AP) - The Chickasaw County Board of Supervisors has been presented numbers from unpaid Justice Court fines and fees with more than $1.8 million currently due the county.\nThe Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports ( http://bit.ly/1Px9Jbr ) the list, presented to the Board of Supervisors, contained names of those already convicted in Okolona and Houston justice court districts and covered 60 pages.\nCurrent figures have over $825,000 in unpaid fines due in Houston Justice Court and $1.058 million in unpaid fines due in Okolona Justice Court.\nBoard of Supervisors President Jerry Hall says the county turns many of those fines and fees over to Mississippi Warrant Network, a business that charges a fee on fines they collect. The service basically makes a telephone call seeking payment for old fines and even garbage fees.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
