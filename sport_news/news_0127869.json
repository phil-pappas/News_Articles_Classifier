I think this is truly our year.\n(Harry) Oh Jack, you've been saying that since 1948. By the way, did you know Kyle Schwarber spelled backwards is Elyk Rebrawhcs?\n(Ron) I think I've been mispronouncing his name frontwards.\n(Ernie) It's a beautiful name.\n(Jack) How about that Joe Maddon. A truly great baseball mind. Reminds me of Lou Boudreau, who I just saw up here last night at dinner with Vince Lloyd. Of course they let me pick up the check. Nothing ever changes.\n(Harry) You've gotta love that during his very first meeting with the press down there at the Cubby Bear, Maddon bought everyone a shot and a beer!\nPhoto gallery: The Cubs clinch the NLDS and celebrate with a 6-4 victory over the Cardinals at Wrigley Field.\n(Brian Cassella) (Ernie) Let's drink two tonight.\n(Ron) I like our chances. Especially with that good-looking youngster at third base, Kris Bryant.\n(Harry) What a handsome young man. Boy oh boy, I bet the gals on Rush Street love him!\n(Jack) Watch it now. He's got a longtime girlfriend. They've been dating since high school.\n(Ernie) They should get married.\n(Ron) Guess who I just talked to?\n(Harry) Marla Collins? Heh-heh.\n(Ron) No, calm down! You know she's not up here. I just ran into Don Drysdale and asked if he's ever seen a pitcher as dominant as Jake Arrieta. He said, \"only Sandy Koufax.\"\n(Ernie) Ronnie, do you remember when Koufax pitched a perfect game against us in L.A. back in '65?\n(Ron) Oh I sure do. I'm still trying to forget it!\n(Harry) (Laughing hysterically) Since we're reminiscing about great moments in Cubs history, Ron do you recall when your toupee caught on fire in New York?\n(Ron) Just like you to bring that up, Harry. Stop it â€¦ or I'll ask you to talk about why you got fired in St. Louis!\n(Harry) (Still laughing) And don't you have one hairpiece for the game, and another one that you wear when you're out on the town?\n(Ernie) Let's wear two!\n(Ron) At least I look better than that guy with the bad hair running for president. What's his name?\n(Jack) Donald Trump. But back to the Cubs, gentlemen. If this reporter's memory is accurate, and I've been up here in the Pearly Press Box nearly as long as Harry, the '69 Cubs did not have the depth or the bench this club has.\n(Ron) Well, you know why that is. We were tired out by August because of all the day games. And Durocher didn't rest us. (Of course, I never wanted to come out of the lineup anyway.) But Maddon keeps his players fresh. I like that about him.\n(Ernie) So they're always ready to play two!\n(Harry) Look at Anthony Rizzo. He's been in almost every inning this season, and he's still playing great baseball. Of course he's Italian so he works harder than anyone.\n(Jack) Now Harry, you and I never missed a game, except when you had your stroke. That's because we loved it. Truth be told, we would have paid to do what we did. Even though in the 5,000 games I broadcast, I never got to do games for a team as good as this one.\n(Ron) Jack, you're absolutely right. To be able to have Wrigley Field as your office, the place where you work, is the best.\n(Harry) Except if you want good food you should really leave the park and go to one of my fine restaurants. Have an ice cold Bud while you're there!\n(Jack) Ronnie, how about bringing back those pizzas you used to sell at Wrigley? We don't have to worry about fat and cholesterol anymore!\n(Ernie) Let's eat two!\n(Ron) Not a bad idea. Oh oh, look at the time. The game starts soon. Ernie, I saw you singing during the seventh inning stretch on that new video scoreboard. I hope they put me up there.\n(Ernie) The fans would love that, Ronnie, even though everyone knows I'm a much better singer.\n(Harry) Holy Cow is that ever a giant scoreboard! But I don't understand what the heck they're doing with all those players' pictures. What in the world is going on? First I heard the Cubs had Fidel Castro playing for them, but when I saw his face it didn't look anything like him.\n(Minnie Minoso arrives) Harry what's the matter with you? It's Starlin Castro! Fidel is not a nice man. But you watch that other Cuban, Jorge Soler. He's a great young ballplayer.\n(Harry) I'll drink to that!\n(Jack) C'mon guys, the game is starting and William Wrigley and his son, P.K., will be joining us. I wonder if WGN would let me interview them on the \"Tenth Inning\" show just for old times' sake.\nBroadcaster Bob Sirott started rooting for the Cubs when he attended his first game at age 8.\nTwitter @ BobSirott\nFacebook.com/SirottandMurciano\n Baseball Opinion Wrigley Field Commentary Ron Santo Ernie Banks", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/BobSirott", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561eadf3/turbine/ct-cubs-clinch-nlds-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e9c03/turbine/ct-perspec-sirott-cubs-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:18:26.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
