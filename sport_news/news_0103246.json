Howie Kendrick reached first base safely and Kiké Hernandez reached home safely, and so although Utley was ruled out, the Dodgers tied the second game of the National League Division Series.\nUtley did not protest the out call. While Tejada was treated by the Mets’ medical staff, he jogged off the field. While Tejada was carted off the field, Utley did not linger in the dugout. Instead the 36-year-old second baseman headed into the tunnel leading to the Dodgers’ clubhouse, where he waited out a five-minute review.\nBecause the throw to Tejada took him away from the base, the neighborhood play was ruled out. And because replays showed Tejada never touched the base, the umpires announced Utley was safe at second base, and he re-emerged, re-taking his place at the base. Quickly, Adrian Gonzalez doubled, and Utley came around to score the game’s decisive run, because baseball and life are like that sometimes.\nThis needs to stop.\nWhile the play might have been smart and might have been the way the game has been played for the last century-plus, it was injurious, and it was dirty. Utley broke Tejada’s right leg.\nUtley did almost the same thing to Tejada five years ago in September, when he was a Phillie and Philadelphia was on its way to the playoffs. Asked then if it was a clean play, Mets captain David Wright said he knew the slide was legal. He said he didn’t have a problem with it, as long as Utley didn’t have a problem with people doing it to him.\n“But somebody is going to get hurt,” Wright said. “So I guess that's a better question for him.”\nPlenty of people have gotten hurt in instances like that in the intervening five years. Not a month ago, Pirates shortstop Jung-ho Kang tore knee ligaments and broke on his leg on a similar play.\nThat day in 2010, Wright continued: “Chase, he plays the game hard. He plays the game passionately. But there's a thin line between going out there and playing the game hard and going out there trying to get somebody hurt. That's a thin line. … As far as I'm concerned, it's done. We move on. We'll reevaluate the way we go into second base.”\nAnd that’s the problem. One of these slides perpetuates five more.\nMLB’s Rule 6.01 seems to instruct its umpires to act differently in the case of exactly what happened Saturday night.\n“If, in the judgment of the umpire, a base runner willfully and deliberately interferes with a batted ball or a fielder in the act of fielding a batted ball with the obvious intent to break up a double play, the ball is dead,” the rulebook reads. “The umpire shall call the runner out for interference and also call out the batter-runner because of the action of his teammate. In no event may bases be run or runs scored because of such action by a runner.”\nOf course, the reason that was not the ruling is because of the first phrase – the judgment of the umpire. Second-base umpire Chris Guccione judged that Utley did not deliberately interfere with the batted ball.\nThe Dodgers won Saturday’s game to tie this NLDS. That will not be taken away from them, and they very well might have won it even if the rule had been enforced as written. Wouldn’t it better if it was decided without controversy?\nWe protest the most mundane things in this sport. If one of baseball’s best hitters runs at 75-percent effort on a pop-up, he’s liable to be removed from a game. If he stands and admires a hit of his for a second too long, he’s liable to be hit by a fastball.\nThose actions are not OK, baseball seems to say. But, to purposely try to hurt another man? That’s OK. That’s to be rewarded.\nThere’s no reason this practice should remain, other than it’s the way things have been always done. And what kind of reason is that?\nContact the writer: pmoura@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:34:16.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
