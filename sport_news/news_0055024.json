The most important thing was that I played well,\" added the Spaniard. \n\"I was out for three months with an elbow injury but I'm playing well. It would be a bonus for me to be there in London, but the goal now is to win tomorrow.\" \nThe tireless 33-year-old will bid for his fifth title of an injury-hit season when he faces American outsider Steve Johnson in Sunday's final. \nThe world number 47 reached his first career final with a 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) defeat of Ernests Gulbis. \n\"Ferrer has been a top 10 player for a decade,\" said Johnson. \n\"It's gonna be fun. He's a bulldog and will compete to his best ability. \n\"I respect everyone but fear no one. I'll play my game and take it to him, Every time you enter an event you expect to win. \n\"This is my first chance to do that, so I want to go out and play good tennis.\" \nJohnson earned his third victory over Latvia's Gulbis, taking 91 minutes to set up a first match with Ferrer. \nJohnson fired 12 aces and 27 winners, committing just a dozen unforced errors while the patchy Gulbis was plagued by 29 miscues. \nGulbis, ranked 117th after once standing in the Top 10, had looked to be on the road to rehabilitation after injuries this season. \nThe Latvian had earlier this week dispatched two of the biggest servers in the game â€” third seed John Isner and number seven Ivo Karlovic. \nJohnson was appearing in his third semifinal of 2015 after knocking out second seed Kevin Anderson in the quarterfinals.
