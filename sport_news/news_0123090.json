The goal came nine minutes after Bangor pulled within 2-1 and had momentum on a goal by Montana Ott. \nTop performers : Redfern and Mayv Clune , a junior forward, each had a goal and an assist for the Lions. Bangor freshman goalkeeper Morgan Pysher turned in an outstanding performance with 21 saves in a losing cause. \nWhat it means : Moravian Academy, which is clearly the class of the Colonial League, will finish as the No. 1 seed for next week's league tournament. Bangor, which will likely be Moravian's opponent in the first round, showed marked improvement from the first meeting between the teams, which Moravian won 9-0. \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
