Kershner took it 75 yards to the house, and the Eagles’ long, long night began to take shape.Dardanelle took a 45-6 lead by halftime on 19 offensive plays. The Sand Lizards opened with a punt return for a touchdown, lit up the scoreboard with a scoop-and-score and each of their scoring drives featured six plays or less.Temo Martiniz made it 10-0 with a 48-yard field goal on Dardanelle’s second drive of the game. Next, the Sand Lizards cut away 80 yards in six plays. Quarterback Elyas Carter found Kershner for 11 yards before Dakota Rowland tore off 26 yards on two run plays. Daniel Craig picked up 35 in two more to set up a 15-yard pass to Kershner to make it 17-0.After forcing the punt, Dardanelle made it 24-0 with 9:29 still left in the half. Carter connected on two straight pass plays to clear off more than 70 yards. Carter hit Caleb Keeling for 33 yards, then found Kershner for 50. Craig scored on a 6-yard scurry to the end zone.Baptist Prep staggered eight plays down the field before turning the ball over on downs. One play later, Kershner was again in the end zone — a 35-yard touchdown pass from Carter. Martiniz added the PAT to make it 31-0 with 7:07 left in the half.Kershner took a four-play vacation from the end zone before scooping up a fumble to make it 38-0 with 5:09 still in the half.The Eagles scored on a 52-yard drive but missed the field goal to leave the score at 38-6.Carter was picked off on the next drive, but Baptist Prep ran out of steam three plays later. Once again, Kershner found the end zone — this time on a 40-yard pass from Carter to set the halftime score.And that was it. The starters scored an entire game’s worth of touchdowns in one half. When the teams retook the field, the Mercy Rule was in effect and the Sand Lizards’ starters were on the bench.Dardanelle tallied 277 yards of total offense in the first half. Carter was 8-of-11 for 206 yards and five touchdowns. Carter stayed on the field in the second half, but with a fast clock not much work was done.Baptist Prep scored with 6:19 left in the third quarter and Dardanelle answered to set the final score.Dardanelle will travel to Ozark on Friday.
