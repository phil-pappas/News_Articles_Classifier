It may take a few weeks, but you’ve got to remember, he’s lost his goalkeeper [Thibaut] Courtois, who’s a fantastic goalkeeper,” Ferguson told ESPN FC. \n“Everyone, including myself, are thinking they were going to be difficult to beat.

In recent weeks, we’ve been treated to Mourinho: firing a classless passive-aggressive shot at Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, calling a reporter’s line of questioning stupid, admitting that this is the worst period of his career, showing some despair regrading his ability to fix the situation , saying he is “not a magician” after one loss and calling some of his own players “rats.” \nHe also said the club “can sack him if they want.” \nSir Alex Ferguson believes however, that Mourinho is going to get things turned around. \n  sometimes   partnered with FOX   The website is also featured on News Now.
