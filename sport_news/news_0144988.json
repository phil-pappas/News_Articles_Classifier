Sometimes when a team is not working you change the manager and things go well and you can say 'Good decision', but when it happens four or five times, come on, be realistic. \n\"I don't think you can blame Martin O'Neill, Paolo Di Canio, Gus Poyet and Dick Advocaat. There is something that is not working there. If I knew what it was I would call the chairman tomorrow but I don't. Fortunately it is not my job. \n\"But they have to look somewhere else. They need to find where to look. They need to take an appointment and stick with it whatever results come in the next two or three years. \n\"Sam Allardyce (should be Sunderland's next appointment). (But) f irst of all I don't know if Sam would like to go and maybe I'm putting it a little on Sam and he is going to kill me next time I see him.\" \nThere remain concerns that Sunderland's fans would not accept Allardyce because of his previous eight-month spell with rivals Newcastle's manager. \nBut Poyet regards his knowledge of the Premier League, from which he has never been relegated, and experience of managing in the north-east as exactly what Sunderland require. \n\"He had an experience before in the n orth-east,\" Poyet said. \"He knows the Premier League inside out and he knows exactly what a team needs to do to stay in the Premier League. \n\"He has done it everywhere he has been so it's not something new. That experience of being there for so long will definitely help.\" \n:: The Leaders Sport Business Summit was held at Stamford Bridge with over 1,500 of the industry's most influential people, sharing insights and sparking discussions to help shape the future of sport.
