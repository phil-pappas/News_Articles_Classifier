(John E. Sokolowski/USA Today Sports) Like Sports News on Facebook: By Todd DeweyLas   \nIf the Toronto Blue Jays complete their comeback from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Kansas City Royals in the American League Championship Series, the Kansas City Public Library will surely incur the wrath of superstitious Royals fans. \nFollowing K.C.'s 14-2 romp in Tuesday's Game 4, the library jabbed the Blue Jays on Twitter , posting an image of three books stacked on top of each other that read, \"Canada. Sorry you lost. What bluebirds do.\" \nThe Toronto Public Library responded Wednesday morning with an image of a stack of books that read, \"Warning. Kansas City. It ain't over till it's over.\" That's how you debate! \nThe Blue Jays bounced back to win Game 5, 7-1, on Wednesday afternoon. The Kansas City library should know better than to tempt fate. The Royals are one of 12 teams to erase a 3-1 deficit to win a postseason series, rallying past Toronto in 1985.
