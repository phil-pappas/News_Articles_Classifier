GEORGE, Utah â€” A St. George man has been contracted to design some graphics for the National Basketball Association after his redesigns of team logos gained attention on the Internet. \nKSL-TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1YQfKUP ) that Addison Foote spent his free time redesigning the Utah Jazz logo as a fun side project. He used the original Jazz music note logo and combined it with the current mountain logo. When he was done, he decided to redesign all 30 of the NBA team logos in 30 days. \nFoote posted his logos online and they quickly gained attention on sports blogs and Reddit. \nAfter the logos became popular, Foote says he was contacted by the NBA and was offered a contract to do some on-the-side freelance graphic design projects for the organization's social media pages. \nInformation from: KSL-TV, http://www.ksl.com/ \nThink your friends should see this?
