No big deal. The Pittsburgh Steelers kicker already has a good grasp of how someone in his high-stress position should handle the mental aspects of the job in the NFL. \"Just week in, week out, keep working,\" Boswell said. \"Already over that game and it's on to the next one.\" Boswell is the Steelers' fourth kicker this season. Judging by his hot start that earned him AFC rookie of the week honors, he'll also be their last. Boswell has been perfect through two weeks, including three long field goals in last Sunday's 25-13 win over the Arizona Cardinals. He's connected from 47, 48 and 51 yards. He also made a 28-yarder and is 5 for 5 on field goals since being signed as a free agent Oct. 3. Last week represented Boswell's first game at Heinz Field, which can be an extremely tricky place for kickers because of the winds that come through the open end of the stadium that faces the Allegheny River. Boswell looked right at home. \"Overthinking will hurt anyone, no matter what position you're at,\" Boswell said \"So I did my best to clear my head and just kick a straight ball.\" Boswell has seemingly put an end to the Steelers' kicking carousel with his strong performance, though he would like to improve his kickoffs; just 4 of 11 have gone for touchbacks. Shaun Suisham, the most accurate kicker in franchise history, sustained a season-ending knee injury in the first preseason game. Garrett Hartley was signed but injured his hamstring in the last preseason game. That led the Steelers to trade with Jacksonville for veteran Josh Scobee. He was released a day after missing two field goals in the final minutes of regulation in an overtime loss to Baltimore. Scobee made just 6 of 10 field goal tries in four games, including 3 of 7 from 40 yards or longer, and also missed an extra point. Boswell spent one week on the Texans' practice squad last season, then was among the Giants' final cuts in training camp this year after nearly beating out incumbent Josh Brown. Now Boswell is perfect in his fledgling two-game career as the Steelers (4-2) visit the Kansas City Chiefs (1-5) on Sunday. \"It's nice to score points when they need me to score points,\" Boswell said. \"That's why I'm here, to put the ball through the yellow pipes. It gives me a good amount of confidence.\" Boswell then paused, knowing a kicker's fortunes can always change. \"I can't just expect to ride this forever,\" he said. ___ AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:31:51.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
