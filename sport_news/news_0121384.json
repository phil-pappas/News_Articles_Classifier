Since then, the Red Devils have ended Lummi’s season in the state playoffs each of the past four seasons. \nFriday it looked like the Blackhawks (4-2, 2-1 NW1B), though undermanned and very young, might have a shot to stop the streak, as they trailed 14-6 late in the first half. But Neah Bay got a long scoring pass just 12 second before halftime and then returned the kickoff to start the second half for a TD. \n“That took the air out of us,” Lummi coach Jim Sandusky said in a phone interview. “We felt like we handed them a couple of TDs in the first half, and then we handed them another. It was pretty frustrating.” \nSo were a few injuries that forced Sandusky to turn to inexperienced backups and a few missed scoring opportunities in the red zone. \n“It was one of those things, where you just kept feeling it slipping away,” Sandusky said. \nSandusky said he was pleased by the play of Free and Raven Borsey on defense and the offensive line also had a pretty good game. \nLummi next hosts Darrington in a non-league game on Friday, Oct. 23.
