The Knights all but locked up a conference title while the Raiders (5-3 overall, 3-1 MSW) hope to lock up a playoff berth with a win against Riverside Brookfield on Oct. 23. \n“This game is win or go home as far as the playoffs go, so we have the mentality going in that we have to win the game and that’s going to propel us,” Cooke said. “It’s a lot of motivation to beat RB.” \nGlenbard South and RB enter the game with matching 3-1 records in conference with mutual losses against IC. RB has clinched a playoff spot with seven wins. The Raiders likely will make the postseason with five wins, but a sixth victory will leave no doubt about the playoffs, so they won’t spend much time dwelling on the loss against IC. \n“Of course you’re disappointed, but we’re still proud of our effort and eager to get back on the field against RB,” Cooke said. \nCooke was South’s workhorse against the Knights, rushing 39 times for 173 yards and a pair of second-half touchdowns, the second giving the Raiders a 21-14 lead with 7:22 left in the fourth quarter. IC tied the game with a 39-yard touchdown pass with 1:05 to play in regulation. \nThe teams traded touchdowns in the second overtime with Jack Crouch connecting with Ryan Willis for a 10-yard score that tied the game at 28-28. \nIn the third overtime, IC’s Jordan Rowell scored his fourth touchdown of the game for the win. \nThe Raiders’ defense played well despite the outcome. Jon Walker, Semetrius Stubbs and Nick D’Ambra had interceptions and D’Ambra recovered a fumble. \nEven with another big game on the horizon, South will be business as usual while preparing to face the Bulldogs. \n“We just keep doing what we do. We’re not going to change who we are because we lost an important football game,” South coach Ryan Crissey said. “We learn from our mistakes and prepare for Riverside Brookfield.” \n– \nWho: Glenbard South at Riverside Brookfield \nWhen: 7:15 p.m. Oct. 23 \nWhere: 160 Ridgewood Road, Riverside \nRecords: GS 5-3 (3-1 MSW), RB 7-1 (3-1) \nOutlook: The Raiders would likely make it with five wins, but they don’t want to leave anything to chance in the Metro Suburban West finale. The Bulldogs are already in the playoffs, but a win would boost their seed and bring a possible home game to start the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:56:22.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
