Roanoke next plays at Hollins Oct. 26. \nRoanoke started off winning its first 16 matches, but has since gone 3-4. But instead of getting down, Graves said the losses have motivated the team. \n“We get really fired up,” said Graves. \nLast year Roanoke lost in the first round of the ODAC Tournament. Graves said the team’s goal this season was to simply go farther than they did last year. \nAs a freshman, Graves played right side hitter, but her coach told her after last season that she would move to middle. \n“It’s totally different than I was in high school,” said Graves. “It’s just getting adjusted to that, but we have some great coaches that help me with that.” \nShe’s also gotten help from her senior teammate Allison White, who has played middle before. \nAt 6-foot, Graves is the tallest person on the team, which prompted the move. So, over the summer she worked a lot on foot speed and quickness. She also had to learn to read where the setter is going with the ball. \n“I was kind of overwhelmed because I had never played middle at the college level,” said Graves. “College is so much different than high school. It’s faster, it’s more tense. I was kind of nervous, but I trained over the summer and it’s worked out.” \nGraves said the biggest adjustment she faced as a freshman was the amount of conditioning expected at the college level. This year, she was more prepared for that. \n“The training, especially preseason, is pretty rough,” she said. “They demand a lot more of you in college than they do in high school.” \nByrd comes up big on defense, but E&H falls short \nRyan Byrd recorded 11 tackles, second highest on the team, Saturday, but his Emory & Henry football team came up short against Hampden-Sydney 31-28. \nByrd, a former Fort Defiance Indian, did pick off a pass in the first quarter, returning it 32 yards and setting up Emory & Henry’s second score of the day, putting the team up 14-0. It was Byrd’s first interception of the season. \nFormer Bison golfer fires 78 \nBridgewater golfer Nathan Hildebrand shot a 78 Tuesday to place 45th individually in the O'Briant-Jensen Memorial in Greensboro, N.C. He had shot an 84 the day before. The former Buffalo Gap golfer, in his first year at Bridgewater, made par on 13 of 18 holes, including the final 10. \nThat was the final tournament of the fall season for the Eagles. They will next play March 14th in Virginia Beach. \n(If you know of former area athletes now competing in college, email Patrick Hite at phite@newsleader.com or send him a tweet @Patrick_Hite and let him know.) 25 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/2015/10/21/graves-byrd-play-big-roles-teams/74354676/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:50:35.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
