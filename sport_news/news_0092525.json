The Ashland High volleyball team dealt its top Rogue Valley rival another agonizing Midwestern League loss Tuesday as the Grizzlies came back to defeat the Comets in five sets at Mountain Avenue Gym. Exactly four weeks after overcoming a two-set deficit to beat the Comets in Central Point, Ashland overcame a two-sets-to-one deficit to hand Crater another memorable MWL setback , 26-28, 27-25, 20-25, 25-22, 15-12. The win was Ashland’s seventh in its last eight matches and improved the Grizzlies to 13-5 overall and 6-2 in the Midwestern. Crater fell to 9-6 and 4-4. “It was a battle tonight,” Ashland coach Robin Akpan said. “It went back and forth on every point, and in the fifth set we had a couple big swings from our outside hitter Olivia Rooney that put us one and two points up on them. So we had a little breathing room from there.” That separation, which occurred at about the halfway point of the fifth set, held as Ashland kept its lead and clinched the match on a service ace. The stars came up huge for the Grizzlies. Rooney, a senior outside hitter, had 13 kills and 27 digs, sophomore middle blocker Alex Crane had 11 kills and two blocks and senior setter Karlie Richardson had 35 assists and seven digs. Also for the Grizzlies, junior libero Myla Norvell had 24 digs and senior right side Ellie Case, who’s still recovering from an ankle injury, had 13 kills and seven blocks. Akpan said the win was crucial to Ashland’s playoff seeding prospects. “I think what it does is it gives us a better chance at obtaining the second position coming out of our conference,” she said. “We had a number of different lineups that we used tonight and we were much more consistent as a team. We didn’t have a lot of highs, but we were consistent throughout the match.” Destiny Fahndrich led Crater with 18 kills and 14 digs, while Nicole Morse added 11 kills and 21 digs and Cassidy Layton 20 digs and 40 assists. Ashland next hosts North Eugene on Thursday. Girls Soccer Ashland senior striker Samantha Lilley needed only 14 minutes to score three goals and the Grizzlies scored eight goals in the first half en route to a 9-0 win over Crater in a Midwestern League blowout Tuesday at North Mountain Park.
