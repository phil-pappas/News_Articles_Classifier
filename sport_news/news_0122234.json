Academy in 2 p.m games. \nFrederick at Allegany \nThe Cadets (1-4) and Campers (4-1) square off for the first time since 1983 this evening at Greenway Avenue Stadium. Kickoff is 7 p.m. \nAllegany had its way last week in a 49-0 skunking of Silver Oak Academy, and so did Darian King, who went over the 100-yard rushing mark in the first quarter and finished with 17 carries, 181 yards and three touchdowns, all in the first half. Carson Imes added a pair of touchdown passes as the Campers built a 42-0 halftime lead. \nKarson Robinette recovered two fumbles and Elisha Llewellyn picked off two passes to lead the defense to its first shutout of the season. \nFrederick is coming off a 50-14 loss to Middletown a week ago. The Cadets have allowed 40 or more points in all five games, and 50 or more in two — the loss to Middletown and a 52-7 setback at Tuscarora. The Cadets have been outscored 232-42 so far this year. \nAllegany leads the all-time series 18-3-1. \nKeyser at Bridgeport \nKeyser could have picked an easier opponent to face after being upset by Hampshire, 17-14, a week ago. They’ll have to try to rebound against two-time defending Class AA state champion Bridgeport. Kickoff is 7:30. \nThe Golden Tornado (5-1) had outscored its first five opponents by 228-74 before the shocker at Hampshire, which was 0-4 at the time. Keyser outgained Hampshire 236-129 in offense, but lost to the Trojans for the first time since 2001. \nMatthew Liller scored on a nine-yard run and Amonte Turner on a 55 yard-punt return for Keyser. Turner’s touchdown gave Keyser a 14-10 lead late in the third quarter. Erick Willis was the leading rusher with 15 carries and 81 yards. \nBridgeport (5-0-1) has scored 48 or more points in all five of its games and has scored 135 in its last two — a 71-29 win over Elkins and a 64-0 rout of East Fairmont. The Indians’ tie this year came in week two when Bridgeport and Wheeling Park settled for ties after their game was suspended repeatedly by stormy weather. \nBridgeport is No. 2 and Keyser No. 7 in this week’s Class AA state ratings. \nBridgeport, which beat Frankfort in last year’s state final, won last year’s meeting 31-6. \nHampshire at Buckhannon-Upshur \nHampshire, riding high after its win over Keyser, hopes to make it two in a row at Buckhannon-Upshur. \nJordan Grapes scored on a 16-yard run midway through the fourth quarter to lift the Trojans (1-4) over Keyser a week ago in Romney. Valka Terzyiski had a 52-yard touchdown run and Evan Staley boomed a 47-yard field goal as the Trojans made the most of 129 yards of offense in the 17-14 victory. \nBuckhannon-Upshur (1-4) has lost three in a row, and fell to Lewis County 40-15 a week ago. \nBuckhannon-Upshur won last year’s meeting 30-14. \nNorthern at Pendleton \nNorthern will be gunning for its third straight win in the second of three straight road games. The Huskies have outscored their last two opponents — Frankfort and Clear Spring — by a whopping 90-6. \nThe Huskies (3-2) won 38-0 at Clear Spring last Saturday. Nate Durst ran 19 times for 133 yards and three touchdowns to lead the attack. The Northern defense did its part, giving up only 41 yards to the Blazers. Kyle Beard was credited with 19 tackles, two sacks and a fumble recovery, Keygan Broadwater had eight tackles and Aaron Rodeheaver seven. \nPendleton (5-1) has won three in a row and beat East Hardy 18-13 on Monday. The Wildcats are No. 8 in the West Virginia Class A ratings. \nNorthern won last year’s meeting 43-14. \nWashington at Frankfort \nFrankfort will be hoping to turn things around in its next-to-last home game. \nThe Falcons dropped a 41-6 Homecoming game to Mountain Ridge a week ago. Kyle Lee scored the only touchdown on a 65-yard interception return. \nJacob Kessel ran 18 times for 81 yards to lead the offense, which was held to 117 yards. \nWashington (1-4) hung tough with Martinsburg last week in a 16-6 loss. P.J. Bowlin scored the touchdown for the Patriots on a 21-yard run. \nFrankfort and Washington did not play last year. \nBerkeley Springs at Petersburg \nPetersburg, after opening the season with two losses, has won three of its last four. The Vikings (3-3) evened their record with a lopsided 32-7 win at Philip Barbour a week ago and are No. 22 in this week’s Class AA state ratings. \nRyan VanMeter ran for 144 yards and a touchdown and completed four passes for 127 yards and a touchdown in leading the Vikes past Philip Barbour. Blanco Hedrick ran three times for 69 yards and a score and Cody Southerly caught three passes for 80 yards and a TD. Nick Dolly scored the other touchdown on a blocked punt. \nBerkeley Springs (1-4) has split its last two games, beating Williamsport 14-13 before falling last week to Moorefield 33-7. Brady Tritapoe had 15 carries and 99 yards and Jeremy Walls 12 carries, 80 yards and a touchdown against Moorefield. \nPetersburg will be out for a little revenge for last year’s game, a 40-8 Berkeley win.
