But the Valiants responded by dominating Game 3 and then had to go extra points to close out their final victory of the regular season. \nThe Valiants were led by their continuous standouts from all season as Erin Moss had 12 kills and two aces, Maylee McLeod had 11 digs and three aces, Ashley Manwell had five digs, three kills, 31 assists and four aces, and Johnson added nine kills. \nValwood will next prepare for the GISA state playoffs, which will begin on Friday, Oct. 23. The Valiants will be a No. 1 seed.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:07:08.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
