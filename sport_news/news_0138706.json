The money would pay for State Police to stay in the Quarter, as well as the Polaris patrols set up by businessman Sidney Torres.\nPolice Superintendent Michael Harrison said the extra law enforcement in the Quarter is working.\n\"Here in the French Quarter for the first six months of this year, we saw a 15 percent overall reduction, but a 35 percent reduction in violent crime right here in the French Quarter, Harrison said. â€œThat's a direct result of extra boots on the ground with both New Orleans police officers and state troopers.\"\nCity officials say if the tax does not pass, the extra patrols will go away.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
