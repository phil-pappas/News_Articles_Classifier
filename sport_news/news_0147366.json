Police say he and six other friends were at a home for a sleepover when he and another 17-year-old started wrestling, with the teen putting Hernandez in a chokehold neck restraint and telling him to indicate when he was giving up. When the teen passed out, the other teen released his hold. \nPolice say the father at the house started CPR and 911 was called. \nHernandez was pronounced dead at the hospital. His cause of death is pending an autopsy. \nPolice spokeswoman Kristi Wyatt says police have determined the death was accidental and don’t plan charges. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:15:45.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
