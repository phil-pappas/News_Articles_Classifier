Greg Hardy's ill-advised comments about Tom Brady's wife this week returning from suspension and the surfacing of a music video including Hardy featuring strippers and guns aren't sitting well with the NFL.\n\"I couldn't disagree more with Greg Hardy's comments, and they do not reflect the values of the league,\" the NFL's first vice president of social responsibility Anna Isaacson told NFL.com . \"We are working hard to bring attention to the positive role models many other players represent and also to continue our education with all members of the NFL family.\"\nHardy was originally suspended 10 games for his involvement in a domestic violence incident in 2014 in which he allegedly strangled a woman named Nicole Holder, threw her on a couch full of guns and threatened to kill her. The suspension was reduced to four games , and he served that suspension over the first four weeks of this season. He's set to make his season debut for the Cowboys on Sunday against the Patriots.\nWhen he was pressed about the incident during the week Hardy's answers were football-related. He said he wanted to come out \"guns blazing\" and made curious comments about Brady's wife Gisele Bundchen.\nMOBILE USERS: WATCH GREG HARDY'S RAP VIDEO HERE\n\"I love seeing Tom Brady, he's cool as crap,\" Hardy said , according to the Dallas Morning News. \"Have you seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game, all her friends come to the game. One of my favorite games of the year, guys.\"\nIn the rap video , which was brought to light by TMZ on Saturday, Hardy says \"\"t'll be a cold day in hell before your girl tries to play me.\"\nHardy was originally found guilty of assault and communicating threats during a bench trial, which came with 18 months probation and a suspended 60-day jail sentence. Hardy appealed for a jury trial, where the charges were dropped because Holder did not cooperate. It is believed that Hardy and Holder made an out-of-court settlement.\nThe defensive end hasn't been remorseful in his public comments, and has instead embroiled himself in more controversy.\n\"I am disappointed with (Hardy's comments,)\" Isaacson told NFL.com. \"We spend a lot of time at the NFL educating our players on domestic violence and sexual assault. That's what we control here, we control education. We control training, we control all the league does from a public perspective and public service, working with non-profit organizations. We can control that. So that everyone in the NFL family has the services and resources that they need if they need help.\"\nAccording to NFL.com, the NFL Players Association released what seems to be a tone-deaf statement, which says \"We prefer that all the networks and media pay more attention to players who have been recognized for their good deeds.\"\nRelated Stories Myers: Goodell gets it wrong again with Greg Hardy Greg Hardy doesn't apologize, makes jokes about women Cowboys' Greg Hardy gets ban reduced from 10 games to 4 Greg Hardy called 'woman beater' by Cowboys teammate: report", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5iuEBqDZbI", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000553695/article/nfl-officials-miffed-with-greg-hardys-comments", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5iuEBqDZbI"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:08:12.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
