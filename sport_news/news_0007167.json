He got the win in Game 3 of the NLDS thanks in part to great run support. He gave up three runs (two earned) on seven hits while walking two and striking out seven. \nHarvey saw the Cubs one time this season and he was brilliant, working seven scoreless innings while only allowing three hits. He struck out nine. Of course, that was on May 13 and the Cubs look quite a bit different these days -- much like the Mets look quite a bit different these days. \nMatt Harvey will start Game 1 against the Cubs.
