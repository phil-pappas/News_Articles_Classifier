The majority of the team’s roster came into the 2015 season with four wins or fewer in a Golden Eagle uniform. \nOn Oct. 17, third-year head coach Todd Monken’s bunch defeated Texas-San Antonio 32-10, picking up its fourth win of the season, compared to just three losses. From 2012-14, the Golden Eagles had 32 of those. \n“I’m having fun,” said senior running back Jalen Richard, who ranks sixth in Conference USA with 81 rushing yards per game. “Those past years, you kind of try to make the fun happen because everything seems to be going wrong. Now, we don’t have to make the fun happen. The fun is happening. Everything is fun. We’re smiling. Coach Monken is being energetic. Just as a team, it’s just fun. \n“This is the best we’ve been together since I’ve been here.” \nRichard is right. But he could’ve taken it a step further, because the current version of the Golden Eagles is also doing some things better than any Southern Miss team has ever done. \nConsider this: In the team’s win over the Roadrunners, two receivers (D.J. Thompson and Mike Thomas) finished with more than 100 yards receiving and two running backs (Richard and Ito Smith) totaled more than 100 yards rushing. That had never been accomplished at Southern Miss prior to Oct. 17. In addition, Thomas became the first Golden Eagle receiver to put up 100-or-more receiving yards in four consecutive contests. \nSouthern Miss’ offense wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, though, in the win over UTSA. Quarterback Nick Mullens threw three interceptions and Smith lost a fumble, marking the team’s second straight game with at least four turnovers. \nBut the Golden Eagles improved to 1-12 under Monken when committing at least three turnovers. \nHow? \n“We’re better than they are,” Monken said. “We should’ve (won). We have a better team. I don’t mean any disrespect. But that’s what I told our team. Four turnovers and you win by three touchdowns, you’ve got a good football team. \n“We’re just hitting the tip of the iceberg of how good we can be.” \nParamount to individual feats and superlatives, however, is the all-important win-loss tally. Monken and company are 4-3 overall and 2-1 in C-USA action – tied for first place with Louisiana Tech. Perhaps more importantly, Southern Miss is a division-best 2-0 vs. West competition. \n“Here’s what we have: If you win every game in the West, do you know how hard it is to not win the West?” Monken said. “We have everything in front of us that we want. Our players understand that. Keep winning games in the West and we’ll be West champs.” \nSouthern Miss travels to Charlotte, an East Division opponent, on Oct. 24. Kickoff is set for 11 a.m. \n“This week’s not a West game, but we’ve got to win that one,” Monken said. “That one puts you in position to win the other West games. Everything is still out there for us.” 21 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1LEa7TT TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:00:52.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
