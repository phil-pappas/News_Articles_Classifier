Photo by Linda Robertson. There is arguably no better track event to watch than a well run 1500m race, and that turned out to be the case at the Caledonian Ground on Saturday afternoon. \nThe battle between Leith runners Jason Palmer and Rob Creasy was the talking point and just 0.07sec separated them at the finish. \nPalmer held on to win the senior men's race, clocking 4min 28.58sec in fine conditions to beat his club mate. \nOli Chignell was also impressive in the 1500m, marking his first hit out on the track after a successful cross country season with a convincing win in the men's 15-17 years section. \nThe Hill City University runner clocked the fastest time of the day (4min 9.38sec), a good sign just seven weeks out from the national secondary schools championships in Timaru. \nNathan Hill (Leith) was second behind Chignell in 4min 19.20sec, while Aaron Anderson (Ariki) won the men's 18 19 years race in 4min 24.68sec. \nRosemary Stamm (Hill City University) clocked the fastest women's time in the 1500m, as she won the senior section in 5min 5.85sec. \nHill City University runners also won the 18-19 years and 15-17 years races, Meg McKay clocking 5min 9.12sec and Jessie Murphy 5min 9.61sec. \nMyrtle Rough (Hill City University) set a national record in the women's 75-79 years section when she crossed the line in 7min 14.15sec. \nTaieri's Christina Ashton recorded good wins in the women's 18 19 years 100m, 100m hurdles and 200m, to show she is building well for the nationals in Timaru in December. \nAshton was the fastest woman in all three events, clocking 15.40sec in the 100m hurdles, 12.71sec in the 100m and 26.58sec in the 200m. \nAshton's sister Hannah chalked up wins in the girls under 14 80m hurdles (13.88sec) 100m (14.10sec) high jump (1.50m) and triple jump (10.15m). \nTerry Collins Hawkins (Hill City University) notched the fastest 100m of the day (10.89sec) in winning the senior men's race. \nRory O'Neill (Ariki) had the second fastest (11.15sec) and won the men's 18-19 years race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:53:10.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
