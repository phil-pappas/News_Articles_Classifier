Choosing to ignore some of the evidence will surely influence the outcome of the findings.\" \nCarneiro was dropped from first-team duties by the Chelsea manager after racing on to the pitch to treat Eden Hazard during a match in August - even though the referee called her on.

That route remains open.\" \nMourinho was asked about the matter at his weekly press conference. \n\"For the past two months I didn't open my mouth and I'm going to keep it like this,\" he said. \"One day I will speak and I will choose a day.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:43:59.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
