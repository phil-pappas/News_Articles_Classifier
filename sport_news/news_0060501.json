Manchester United and CSKA Moscow have four points each after playing to a 1-1 draw in Russia. \nWolfsburg had the first chance of the match through Naldo and that set the tone for the night. Wolfsburg, however, was fortunate not to concede a penalty when Naldo handled the ball while leaning on Luuk de Jong. \nAfter goalless first half, Bast broke the deadlock a minute after the re-start. \nJosuha Guilavogui fired a shot from the edge of the box, Jeroen Zoet dived to his left to block the ball but Dost pounced on the rebound — with the PSV defense caught off guard — to score from close range. \nZoet made another fine save just before Wolfsburg's second goal. Julian Drexler cut inside to shoot but Zoet again dived to his left to parry. Daniel Caligiuri picked up the loose ball on the right flank and sent over a perfectly-timed cross for Kruse to head inside the far post. \nPSV applied some pressure late in the match and Benaglio was forced to rush off his line to deny Locadia, but brought the forward down. \nBenaglio made amends by reading Locadia's shot from the spot and palming the ball away. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:52:09.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
