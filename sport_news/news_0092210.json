Bogar, 48, spent this past season as Dipoto's special assistant in Anaheim, but the former .228 career hitter for the Mets, Astros and Dodgers has a proven track record of managing success in the minor leagues, where he amassed a 362-266 record and reached his league's championship four times. A disciple of Cubs manager Joe Maddon and Indians manager Terry Francona, Bogar went 14-8 last season as the Rangers' interim manager after Ron Washington abruptly resigned.

Photo-8790408.118706   14 Bud Black has long been rumored as a Mariners managerial candidate, mostly because of his local connection. The 58-year-old went to Mark Morris High School and Lower Columbia College in Longview before going on to a 15-year MLB career with the Royals, Giants, Indians, Mariners and Blue Jays. As a manager, Black compiled a 649-713 record with the Padres from 2007 to 2015 until he was fired by GM A.J. Preller in mid-June. The Padres never made the playoffs under Black's watch, so he'd fit right in with the Mariners.

The 44-year-old is apparently one of the most sought-after candidates despite the fact he's never managed higher than Triple-A. Having spent the bulk of his 12-year career as an outfielder and first baseman with the Padres, Nevin might be best suited to land in San Diego. But a report from USA Today said he's interviewed with Miami and Washington and was expected to interview with Seattle. Nevin's latest managing gig was with the Reno Aces, the Diamondbacks' Triple-A affiliate. Phil Nevin has been linked to managerial jobs with the Nationals, Padres, Marlins and Mariners.

Alex Cora currently serves as an analyst for ESPN, but he's interviewed with the Padres, Marlins and Nationals, according to reports. Cora, who turns 40 this month, was a .243 hitter during 14 big-league seasons. Hiring him wouldn't bring the same fanfare it would if they hired Joey Cora, but little brother seems like the more qualified of the two candidates.

Ibanez had three stints with the Mariners that totaled 11 of his 19 big-league seasons. The former outfielder has no managing experience. But he would be the sort of creative hire the Mariners basically never try. Also, he was a finalist for the Tampa Bay Rays job last year before withdrawing his name from consideration.

The former catcher currently serves as the club's minor league roving catching coordinator. The Mariners brought him on the big-league staff in September, raising suspicion that he may be in line for a bigger role. But with McClendon's firing and Dipoto cleansing much of the minor-league staff, it's unclear what Wilson's role with the organization will be going forward.

That earned him Baseball America's minor league manager of the year and got him an interview with the Mariners, who went on to hire Lloyd McClendon. DiSarcina spent two seasons as an assistant GM with the Angels (one with Tony Reagins, one with Dipoto) so there's been speculation the 47-year-old will be brought in for an interview.

But what if the Mariners considered Lou Piniella? Sure, he's 72. But he's also in good health and the only manager in franchise history to lead the Mariners to the playoffs. Nobody is more popular in Seattle than \"Sweet Lou.\" Plus, 72 is the new 52. In 2003, manager Jack McKeon led the then-Florida Marlins to the World Series at 72. Current vice president Joe Biden is 72, and he could be the next U.S. president, should he decide to run. Again, there's no way this is happening. But the Mariners would become more fun if it did.
