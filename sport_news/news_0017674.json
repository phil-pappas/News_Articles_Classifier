She is also the third CHS golfer in recent history (Summar Roachell, three times, and Mary Michael Maggio) to win the Overall title. Roachell, a sophomore at the University of Arkansas, was the last senior to win it going back-to-back her junior and senior years. \nOtt’s 76 gave her a one-stroke victory over four golfers, Matthews, Hannah Bakalekos of North Little Rock, Elizabeth Moon of Wynne and Katelyn Dunstan of Baptist Prep, in one of the tightest female competitions in history. In a four way playoff for second and third, Matthews took second \nwith a par on the first playoff hole and Bakalekos took third with a par on the second playoff hole. Bakalekos had a triple-bogey on her round, which probably prevented her from winning. \nOtt had five birdies on her round, two on the final four holes, Nos, 15 and 16. \n“The biggest birdie was on 15,” she said. \n“That gave me momentum for the final stretch. I stuck a wedge within 3 feet on the approach. I hit a pretty good shot on 17 and made a 10-foot putt. That gave me momentum for 18.” \nThe tournament was played in 98-degree temperatures, the hottest October day in Arkansas history. \nThere were intermittent winds throughout the course that gave many golfers problems. \n“The biggest thing about the heat is it helps me hit it farther,” she said. \n“If I can feel the wind, I can calculate it pretty well ... I’m happy to win it the way everyone else was playing. Any of the four players behind me could have won it.” \nShe had a goal of shooting 74. \n“I didn’t think 76 would win it considering the quality at the top of the field,” she said. “But 76 has won it most years.” \nThe hottest round of the hot day came in the boys division. \nJonesboro’s Wil Gibson, another sophomore, fired a 3-under 69 to win the boys title. \nIt was one of the best rounds ever recorded in the Overall at PVCC, which rarely yields under-par scores to high school golfers. \nHe birdied four holes on the front nine, three straight. \nGibson won by seven strokes over Fayetteville’s Luke Long and Rogers Heritage’s Justin Winkel. \nLong took second place on the second playoff hole. \nPaxton Templeton of Mayflower shot a 41-42 — 83 to finish ninth. Will Jackson of Conway Christian was 46-43 — 89 for 17th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:54:52.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
