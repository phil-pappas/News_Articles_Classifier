He was buried in the ancestral graveyard in the village amidst sloganeering by the mourners, a police official said.\nA youth was seen carrying a Pakistani flag during the funeral procession which passed off peacefully as authorities had made stringent security arrangements. The official said the restrictions imposed in the Anantnag police station area were eased to allow the people to participate in the funeral.\nHowever, soon after, clashes broke out between protesters and police personnel in Anantnag and some adjoining areas, police said.\nGroups of youths started pelting stones at police personnel at Batengoo and some other areas of Anantnag as they were returning from the burial. Police used tear gas shells to disperse the protesters but the clashes were going on till last reports came in, a police official said, adding there were no reports of anyone getting hurt.\nThe traffic on Srinagar-Jammu National Highway was severely affected due to clashes in Anantnag, which falls on the arterial road connecting the Valley with rest of the country.\nProtests also rocked Banihal town of Ramban district during the shutdown today. People burnt tyres and blocked the highway for an hour amid sloganeering. Protests were also held in Kishtwar and Gandoh belts of Chenab Valley.\nNormal life was affected in Kashmir Valley due to the strike called by separatists and trade organisations.\nMost of the shops, business establishments, petrol pumps and private educational institutions remained closed while government offices and banks witnessed thin attendance, officials said. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:12:11.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
