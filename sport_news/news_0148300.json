Staying true to Texas\nWhile at Denton Guyer, where he won two state titles , the four-star dual-threat quarterback said that schools like Nebraska, Ohio State, LSU and USC made last-ditch efforts to pry him away from his commitment to the Texas Longhorns. He explained to ESPN about how he'd turn down offers from schools.\n\"I straight up tell that I'm committed to Texas,\" Heard said. \"I appreciate the recruitment and everything.\"\nHe also told the Austin American-Statesman that the coaching change from Mack Brown to Charlie Strong didn't have an impact on his commitment.\n\"I felt like coach (Charlie) Strong was a great coach, and with what he's done for Louisville, I thought staying would just be an add-on to what I'm trying to become. I was excited,\" he told the site.\n2. His scouting report\nAccording to ESPN, Heard was the Longhorns' second-best recruit of the 2012 class (he was tied with Armanti Foreman and Edwin Freeman for second). The site, along with Rivals and 247 Sports, listed him as a four-star recruit.\nHere's part of ESPN's scouting report on Heard before he enrolled at Texas.\nOn his accuracy as a passer : \"Possesses good foot quickness and body control. Shows a fluid, quick throwing motion, although he does have a low elbow. His motion is relatively compact, but he cups the ball a bit too. Needs to follow through more consistently and transfer his weight with authority. Throws firm accurate passes that are very catchable.\"\nOverall assessment : \"Heard is a good prospect that needs more mechanical polish as a thrower. Athletic, but easier to project as a QB than an athletic QB who could play another position. Will operate effectively from under center or out of the shotgun. A very good athlete who has been well coached. What you see is what you get. He has nice tools for the spread offense.\"\n3.

He was a part of the game with the crazy punt for a safety\n\"It was very weird, and from the grace of God those balls bounced our way and those safeties really helped us,\" Heard told the Denton Record-Chronicle .\n5. Strength\nESPN's scouting report said that one of Heard's weaknesses entering college was his strength. Doesn't look too shabby with a 310 pound power clean while at Denton Guyer.\n6. His high school stats\nHere are his stats according to SportsDayHS from his three years as Denton Guyer's starter.\nPassing: 429-705 for 6,512 yards / 67 touchdowns, 24 interceptions\nRushing: 642 carries for 4,949 yards / 67 touchdowns\n7. An expanded look\nHere's a breakdown of his stats per year, including some notable facts.\n2011-2012\nPassing: 130-223 for 2,286 yards / 28 touchdowns, 10 interceptions\nRushing: 136 carries for 650 yards / 5 touchdowns\n2012-2013\nPassing: 155-250 for 2,090 yards / 17 touchdowns, 7 interceptions\nRushing: 250 carries for 2,138 yards / 35 touchdowns\n2013-2014\nPassing: 144-232 for 2,136 yards / 22 touchdowns, 7 interceptions\nRushing: 256 carries for 2,161 yards / 27 touchdowns\n8 . He's got some moves\n9. Clutch gene\nIn Guyer's consecutive state titles, Heard put up some pretty impressive numbers.\nHeard's first state title was one to remember. Guyer trailed by 14 at one point to Georgetown, but rallied for a 48-37 win thanks to the quarterback's seven total touchdowns. Heard went 8-13 for 189 yards passing and two touchdowns, as well as gaining 143 rushing yards on 24 carries for five touchdowns.\nIn the second title game against San Antonio Brennan, Heard went 9-9 passing with 97 yards and a touchdown. He also chipped in 146 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the ground in the team's 31-14 win .\n10. Two titles in high school, two in college?\nHeard doesn't lack confidence. He said that he's aiming for two titles while at Texas .\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDQOvB_J1YY", "http://t.co/sg8d9QpG8v", "http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/school/_/id/251/class/2014", "https://twitter.com/SmileHeardJ", "https://twitter.com/isaacsingle/status/642390959154597889", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVhbuQGWmik", "http://www.dentonrc.com/sports/high-schools/high-school-football-headlines/20121012-football-guyer-rolls-past-nelson-in-strange-showdown.ece", "http://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2015-09-14/texas-football-heard-envisions-leading-longhorns-titles-qb", "http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/evaluation/_/id/157702/jerrod-heard", "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/sports/college-football/signing-day-qa-jerrod-heards-thoughts-on-texas-str/ndC6Y/", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/14/carlton-jerrod-heard-unfazed-spotlight-comes-reviving-longhorns-offense", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kiqJGBtw5zA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3z2nwi1FyA"], "published": "2015-09-15T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:12:33.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
