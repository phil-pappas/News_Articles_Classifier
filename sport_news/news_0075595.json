And the talk is that representatives for Harris are asking their client be the highest-paid quarterback in the CFL. \nIt’s a shocker, but perhaps not surprising given how Harris has performed in Ray’s absence. \nThe number being floated around is $450,000, Ray money, only Harris isn’t Ray. \nBoth players are good people, good teammates and among the classiest in the CFL. \nHarris could very well dictate terms if he’s able to produce in the post-season and even win a Grey Cup. But as of now, there’s no way the Argos should even consider such a salary for Harris. \nMaybe there is a team out there willing to fork over the kind of money that’s being talked about, perhaps Harris may actually stay in Toronto if the team continues to win. \nThe Argos tried to work out a deal to keep Collaros, but he wanted to be the man and that’s when the Ticats pounced. \nCollaros benefitted from playing in the Milanovich system, but what separates Collaros from the rest is his ability to make plays with his feet, a gunslinger mentality that is second to none. \nThe Argos brought both Collaros and Harris to town in 2012. During training camp last season, the Argos gave Harris an extension. \nThe CFL, with so many injuries to front-line quarterbacks, has been on a youth kick, fresh-faced quarterbacks performing to mixed reviews. \nHarris has shown he’s a starter, but he has yet to play in a playoff game. \nRay has won three Grey Cups and it’s why he deserves to be paid handsomely. \nDespite the growth Harris has shown in helping lead the Argos to a 9-5 season, the jury is still out. \nThe Argos don’t know what Ray has left, but he is getting closer to playing. \nIt’s always been a quarterback conundrum that faced the Argos, a team moving forward with no signal caller under contract beyond this season. \nBarker, Milanovich and Ray were always tied together. \nWhen Barker and Milanovich were extended, Ray was excluded. \nIt made sense given Ray was coming off a shoulder procedure in the off-season. \nWhat doesn’t make sense is to make Harris the highest-paid quarterback. \nARGOS WILL CALL THE HAMMER HOME \nThe Argos’ home/road show will now officially involve the Hammer. \nThe team released a statement on Tuesday, confirming that this Saturday’s game against Calgary will be played at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton. \nKickoff is 4 p.m. and no one is willing to estimate what kind of crowd, what kind of environment, what kind of reception awaits. \nWhat’s known is that the Argos have rallied around the many issues that don’t involve football, winning home games played in Fort McMurray and Ottawa. \nThe sad part is that the Argos should have been home for the season’s final four games with a legitimate shot of winning the East and playing host to the divisional final with a berth in the Grey Cup on the line. \nThey may yet come out on top, but playing a home game in Hamilton isn’t what anyone associated with football operations could have envisioned. \nIf the Jays advance and keep advancing, more home games in Hamilton will be played, the next involving the Oct. 23 matchup with Montreal. \nIn three visits to Tim Hortons Field, the Argos have lost each game to the host Ticats. \nThe Stamps beat Hamilton on its home turf in Calgary’s first visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:26:50.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
