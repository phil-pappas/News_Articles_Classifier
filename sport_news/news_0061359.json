Rob McCurdy/News Journal \nBELLVILLE - Meshia Curry's reputation preceded her. \nWhen she was a sophomore at Lexington, she was forced to take over the goalkeeping duties in the finals of the Ohio Cardinal Conference girls soccer tournament. She beat Clear Fork after the match went to penalty kicks. \nWhen deja vu happened last week against Madison, Clear Fork coach Brittany Bechtel remembered she now has Curry on her roster. \n\"I had an idea that I was going to be (the goal keeper), but I didn't know if it was a for-sure thing. When I came out and the overtime was over, Coach asked me if I wanted to do it, and I said, 'I'm ready.' \" \nA defender by trade, the last time Curry spent any time in goal was in that long ago match. Not even in practice had she dabbled with it. \nStill, Bechtel remembers how her team reacted when Curry strode into the net. \n\"There is something about the intimidation factor that she brings,\" Bechtel said. \nThe coach figured if she can throw her body in front of shots when she's not the goal keeper, her side-to-side agility, quickness, soccer instincts and aggressiveness would fit the profile of a penalty kick goal keeper. \n\"I had to make a decision, and that's what my heart was telling me,\" Bechtel said. \"I didn't want to hurt anyone in the process, but that's what I was feeling in the moment, so I go with my gut.\" \nThe coach and Curry said it was discussed before the start of the OCC tourney that she may be pressed into duty if penalty kicks were ever involved. \n\"If I had never met her in the net at Lexington, I'd have never thought of it.\" Bechtel said. \"This girl literally shook us that day when she walked in that net. There's something about how she walks to the net. Her confidence is like, 'I've got it. Give me the jersey. I just need gloves.' \" \nCurry blocked two of five attempts by the Rams, one by jumping, one by kick save. In sudden death, Madison's first attempt was wide and Clear Fork freshman Mackenzie Thorne won it with her ensuing shot. \n\"Two years ago, she won against us for Lex,\" Thorne said of Curry's role in goal. \"Coach said she'd be willing to throw her body in front of the ball, and she did great.\" \nBechtel didn't want to hurt the feelings or confidence of her freshman keeper Kaylee Krausman, but the coach said in-game keeping and PK keeping require different skill sets, and she wasn't sure how someone so young would handle such a pressure-filled moment. Going forward, Bechtel admitted she's not sure she's go to Curry again if the same scenario arises. \n\"You've got to have somebody (who is confident) in the net. You can't have somebody who is scared or afraid. I've got a freshman, and let's be honest, she's young. I don't know her background in PKs,\" Bechtel said. \nCurry simply tried to get her body on the ball during those six kicks. \n\"I couldn't let my team down,\" she said. \nAt 13-2, the Colts open Division II sectional play Thursday when they host Lexington at 5 p.m. \n\"We really need the big win to go into our state tournament,\" Curry said. \"This gave us some confidence.\" \nrmccurdy@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:24:15.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
