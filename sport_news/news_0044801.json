Special photo by William Lofton slideshow Lassiter will come to Etowah on Friday coming off a bye and looking to save its season.But standing in the Trojans’ way is an Eagles team that needs a win just as bad to stay in contention for the Region 5 title.“We all know what the situation is,” Lassiter coach Jep Irwin said. “We know what we need to do, and that’s to go there and get a win.”To get a win, Lassiter (3-3, 1-3) will need to contain an Etowah offense that has been hard to even slow down this season. The Eagles (6-1, 4-1) have done most of their damage on the ground this season, with Tyray Devezin and Trey Moore running behind a big offensive line, but Irwin said he has a plan to contain that.“When we’re on defense, we need to get them in passing situations,” he said. “When they’re able to run the ball effectively enough and throw with play action, it’s hard to tell whether they’re running or passing. If we can make them a little more predictable, that’s an advantage for us. If not, it’s going to be difficult to stop them, because they’ll throw it on running downs and vice versa.”Making that task more difficult for the Trojans is Patrick Ferris. The sophomore quarterback had a breakout game last week at Milton, completing 12 of 14 passes for 210 yards and three touchdowns.“Patrick has shown the ability to throw the ball at different times this year,” Etowah coach Dave Svehla said. “We had gone away from it a little bit, but I was glad we were able to get back to throwing the football last week. The one thing Lassiter does have is some very talented athletes in its secondary, and they’re going to challenge us.”Svehla is also concerned about Lassiter’s interior defense, which will be key when Etowah does throw the ball.“I think they have a couple of really impressive defensive linemen,” Svehla said. “They’re very aggressive, and they try to put pressure on people. It’s up to us to stay disciplined, keep our heads up and pick up blitzers. That’s going to be a real challenge for us.”Lassiter will look to throw the ball, too, with Bradley Riopelle and Cooper Cross both seeing time at quarterback this season. Either could start Friday.“We’ll let it be a game-time decision,” Irwin said. “They both practiced well over the last two weeks, so we’re not going to say at this point. It’s always a possibility that we could see both of them.”Regardless of who plays quarterback, Svehla said his main concern comes from the playmakers Lassiter deploys on the outside.“Our defensive coaching staff has spent an awful lot of time in film getting us ready for this one,” he said. “Lassiter has some really, really good weapons. They have some really good receivers and some big bodies as well. They can catch the ball in traffic. It makes us nervous, but, hopefully, our kids will start out by recognizing formations, making sure we get lined up correctly and staying disciplined with our drops.”Irwin said he has confidence in either of his quarterbacks to utilize those weapons, but he knows Etowah is a hard team to beat for a largely one-dimensional offense.“I don’t think we can just line up and run the ball at them,” Irwin said. “I think we have to find our spots to try to run it. We’re going to have to be balanced. I don’t think we’re going to need a dominant running game, but we need to be able to mix one in every now and then.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:05:16.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
