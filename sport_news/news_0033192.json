(AP) - The cost of Gov. Bobby Jindal's security detail has doubled to more than $3 million since the Republican governor entered office nearly eight years ago.\nThe Louisiana State Police says the hefty price increase isn't largely driven by Jindal's frequent out-of-state travel, but more by a sizable pay raise given to state troopers last year.\nProtective services for the governor cost just under $1.5 million in the 2007-08 budget year when Jindal first took office. Data provided to The Associated Press shows the price tag rose to $3.1 million in the 2014-15 year that ended June 30.\nState lawmakers have complained about taxpayers footing the bill for Jindal's trooper bodyguards as the governor increased his out-of-state trips, readying for a presidential campaign he announced June 24.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
