His only other goal came in the FA Cup tie against Bristol Rovers in January 2014.Robinson's goal cancelled out Matt Phillips' 17th-minute opener, and Paul Caddis sealed the turnaround by converting a 63rd-minute penalty.From the start Birmingham were keen to atone for their recent indifferent form at St Andrew's following two successive home defeats.But some of the early play was untidy, with Rangers attempting to surprise Birmingham on the counter-attack.The highlight of the opening exchanges was undoubtedly the superb diving save by Robert Green to keep out a Demarai Gray effort.And Green's early heroics helped enable Rangers to take the lead. Phillips collected a long ball down the channel from Nedum Onuoha with his back to Birmingham's defence, and cleverly stunned the ball to drop it at his feet before despatching a rocket-like cross shot past Tomasz Kuszczak.Birmingham's response was immediate as they increased their attacking tempo, and they were rewarded with a 25th-minute equaliser.It came from the most unlikeliest source. Gray took a free-kick deep out on the left and, with everyone jostling for position, veteran Robinson raced around the back of Rangers defence to head home his noteworthy goal.The London club's rearguard was opened up again by the pace of Gray. He collected an accurate low pass from the industrious Stephen Gleeson but his powerful shot was just off target.With a disjointed Rangers obviously missing the goal threat of Charlie Austin and Jamie Mackie, there was little real threat from the visitors' attack with the exception of a speculative left-footed shot by Tjaronn Chery.They had a let-off when Clayton Donaldson, sliding in, just missed a low cross from David Davis.But this showed the writing was on the wall as Birmingham laid siege on Rangers' goal.The pressure eventually paid off for Blues when Donaldson was pushed in the area by Onuoha and Caddis coolly capitalised from the penalty spot.Rangers, who have failed to show their true potential this season, staged a late rally but were thwarted on several occasions by the tenacity of Robinson on one of his now rare first-team appearances.Before the game there was a warm minute's applause for Howard Kendall, whose death was announced earlier in the day. The former Everton player and manager played for Birmingham at the end of his career.
