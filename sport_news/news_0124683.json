They play the winner of Game 5 between Houston and Kansas City later Wednesday. Game 1 of the ALCS is Friday night.\nBautista's homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score.\n  \"It's the most emotionally charged game that I've ever played,\" Bautista said.\nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay.\nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors, and Toronto rallied. Benches cleared twice in the Blue Jays' half of the inning.\nRoberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save.\nOsuna turned toward the outfield after striking out Wil Venable, looked to the sky and was mobbed by his teammates as jubilant fans rocked the Rogers Centre.\nAfter Edwin Encarnacion tied it 2-all with a second-deck drive off tough-luck loser Cole Hamels in the sixth, Odor led off the seventh with a single and went to third on a sacrifice and groundout.\nWith Choo up, Martin's throw back to reliever Aaron Sanchez deflected off Choo and dribbled toward third base.\nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned the call, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home.\n\"I just caught the ball and threw it back very casually and it hit his bat and then next thing you know run scores. It's never happened in my life before,\" Martin said. \"It's just one of those moments, and it created an opportunity for us to do something special.\"\nFans littered the field with objects during the delay as umpires sorted out a play that is certain to rank up there with Derek Jeter's Jeffrey Maier homer or Reggie Jackson's hip block of a throw as one of the craziest in the postseason.\nAccording to rule Major League Baseball rule 6.03(a)(3), the batter is not to be charged with interfering with the catcher if the batter is still in the batter's box and doesn't make a movement to block or disrupt the throw.\nThis type of play is not subject to manager's review but Scott, the crew chief, after discussing the ruling with Blue Jays manager John Gibbons, called an umpire's review. After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field.\nThe Blue Jays filed a protest.\nNo need for the paperwork, though.\nThe Rangers made three consecutive errors to start the bottom half, with Martin reaching on a fielding error by Elvis Andrus to start it off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:16:03.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
