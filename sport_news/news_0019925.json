(AP) - Planners in New Hampshire are exploring the possibility of establishing commuter bus service along Interstate 89 from New London to Lebanon and Hanover.\nThe Valley News reports ( http://bit.ly/1Q0WFt4 ) planners believe there's demand due to population growth and commuting patterns. They hope to determine whether it's sufficient to support the service and how much it would cost.\nNate Miller, executive director of the Upper Valley Lake Sunapee Regional Planning Commission, says this could alleviate congestion, cut down on air pollution and delay costly infrastructure improvements.\nThe commission is seeking requests from consultants to investigate the feasibility of bus service along the corridor. It has a $64,000 transportation planning and research grant to assist in the study.\nThe study is expected to be completed by June 2016.\nInformation from: Lebanon Valley News, http://www.vnews.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
