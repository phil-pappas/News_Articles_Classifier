The Sporting News points out interview itself was \"pretty routine,\" but the backdrop revealed several of Jones' teammates completely naked. \nSBNation said viewers could see a glimpse of one player's penis, several bare backsides and \"one guy [who] looked like he was holding his junk on the way to the shower.\" \n\"Wowee, zowie, what an interview,\" one commentator said after the segment. \n\"Yeah, that was interesting.\" \nAlbert Breers, who conducted the interview, commented on the mishap on Twitter with an embarrassed face emoji. ðŸ˜³ RT @Official_JCope : Now NFL Network has to be considered NSFW, thanks @AlbertBreer haha â€” Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) October 19, 2015 \nIt's unlikely the FCC will penalize the NFL Network, a cable and satellite network, as the incident didn't occur on broadcast television like Janet Jackson's Super Bowl \"wardrobe malfunction\" on CBS in 2004. Still, others are calling for some action to be taken. \n\"Why do I have to explain to my kids why their dad is naked on tv?\" Bengals offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth tweeted Monday morning. \"@nflcommish ?? @nflnetwork ?? Time for a media policy change!!\" \nÂ» NSFW video of the interview can be seen at YouTube and Deadspin Laughing so hard at @nflnetwork showing accidental naked football player footage behind a post-game interview â€” ashley watts (@ashrwatts) October 19, 2015 NFL Network accidentally broadcasted naked players in the locker room on TV???
