He is still in critical condition, and there are a number of conflicting reports about how much he can talk and move. But one thing that has not changed is that his kidneys remain in jeopardy.\nOdom has been on dialysis for the last week, something that will now continue in Los Angeles for a reported six hours per a day. A transplant is the last resort, particularly since finding a match via an organ donor can be extremely difficult. But unfortunately, it may become necessary.\nIn addition to that ongoing issue, doctors are still unsure of the amount of brain damage Odom may have suffered. As previously noted, the former NBA star’s cognitive abilities are being continually assessed. But his long-term prognosis and how meaningful of a recovery he could have remain unclear.\nKhloe Kardashian traveled with Odom as he was taken from Las Vegas to Los Angeles via helicopter, and is believed to still be by his side. No one in the Kardashian family has publicly commented on the transfer, or Odom’s latest status. Gossip Cop will continue to have updates.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://gossipcop.com/tag/lamar-odom", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfCUvo.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Preparing", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfCL5P.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfwucU.img&quot;}}", "http://splashrss.mainstreamdata.com/RSS/SplashVideo.ashx?feed=1&amp;thumb=1280&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfsYqj.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBhb5GY&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;basketball_nba&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:false,&quot;Mute&quot;:false,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:48:22.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
