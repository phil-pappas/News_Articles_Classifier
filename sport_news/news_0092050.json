The Lady Tigers (14-9, 8-1) swept Har-Ber despite trailing 19-16 in the first set, 15-14 in the second set, and 10-5 in the third set. \nSadie Pate had 24 kills for Bentonville, which fell to second place in the 7A-West after losing to Fayetteville. \n\"This was a complete mental game for our girls,\" Bentonville coach Michelle Smith said. \"We've been working on strengthening our minds in intense situations when we're down and trying not to cave in. Athletically, we've had it from the beginning but, mentally, we haven't.\" \nHar-Ber was 8-0 before losing 25-18, 25-17, 25-18 at Bentonville on Sept. 8. The Lady Wildcats played better Thursday but couldn't contain their momentum against the Lady Tigers. \nKlaire Trainor had 14 kills and Lauren Thompson 13 kills to lead Har-Ber (15-3-2, 6-3). \n\"Bentonville's a good team. They're very consistent and that's why they're fun to play against,\" Har-Ber coach Shyrah Schisler said. \"If we could beat a Bentonville, it would be huge for our program. They're very good and they play great defense.\" \nBentonville rallied from 18-14 and 19-16 deficits to take the first set, 25-23. The Bentonville surge was led by Pate, whose kill put the Lady Tigers ahead 23-22. Har-Ber tied the game before Bentonville went ahead again on a dink from Tymber Riley. \nBentonville then completed the comeback when Emma Palasak went high for a block that went out of bounds off a Har-Ber player. \nHar-Ber jumped ahead in the second set and led 15-14 following a serving ace by Elizabeth Williams. But Bentonville zipped past the Lady Wildcats again with five consecutive points to take a 19-15 lead. \nBentonville got to match point after Pate faked a kill with a strong right arm and dropped a return serve into the open Har-Ber court. Palasak then won the game with a kill to give Bentonville a 2-0 series lead. \nBentonville called two timeouts in the third set after falling behind 7-3 and 10-5. But the Lady Tigers again regained their compsure and won 25-21 to complete another sweep over the Lady Wildcats. \nHar-Ber will participate in the Fort Smith Invitational this weekend before continuing league play at Fayetteville on Tuesday. Bentonville will play at Rogers on Tuesday. \nSports on 10/02/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:38:02.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
