The Longhorns of coach Carl Frerichs edged Coal Ridge 7-3 on a blustery evening for their second consecutive victory. “Really proud of our kids,” Basalt head coach Carl Frerichs said. “It’s a big win for us.” Coal Ridge held a 3-0 halftime lead. But Basalt opened the third quarter with a sustained drive. “Kyle Roberts had a huge catch on the drive,” Frerichs said. Quarterback Miles Levy ran a sneak from a yard out for the touchdown. David Flores added the extra point for the only scoring in the second half. “The defense played phenomenally all night,” Frerichs said. “Ian Lumsden, the whole defensive line played great. Will Chadbourne had a huge play to break up a pass.” He said the windy weather affected the passing game at New Castle. A bit of light rain also fell, he said. “Yes, we needed this one,” Frerichs said. Basalt improved to 1-0 in conference play, 2-3 overall. Coal Ridge dropped to 0-1 in league; the Titans are 2-3 overall. Basalt will make the long trip to Craig next Friday night to take on Moffat County.
