(AP) - Residents of Alstead, New Hampshire, gathered to dedicate a plaque honoring the deaths, damages and recovery efforts on the 10th anniversary of the 2005 flood.\nThe plaque is built into a stone on the banks of the Cold River, which raged and took out homes, vehicles, roads and bridges a decade ago.\nAlstead and the nearby towns of Langdon and Walpole were among the hardest hit when rain drenched the state. The U.S. Geological Survey reports that at least seven inches of rain fell in a 30-hour period. Seven people died - four of them in Alstead - and homes and property were destroyed.\nWMUR-TV reports ( http://on.wmur.com/1OtkTx5 ) that Alstead residents raised the $1,000 for the plaque with donations of $20.05 each - an amount representing the year of the flood.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
