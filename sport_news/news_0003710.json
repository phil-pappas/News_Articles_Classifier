(Getty Images) By Alex J. Jankowski \nThe midseason acquisition of outfielder Yoenis Cespedes -- and the immediate effect it had on the NL East-champion New York Mets' offense -- was one of the biggest stories in baseball. \nIn the flash of an 89-mph fastball from Philadelphia's Justin De Fratus, that narrative nearly came to a screeching halt. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nCespedes took the fastball off his left hand when batting Wednesday in the third inning, collapsing to his knees in obvious pain while Mets fans all held their collective breaths and began to fear the worst. Can the Mets psychologist help me through this tough time waiting to find out if Cespedes is really hurt? - Cara Jeffrey (@cara_jeffrey) October 1, 2015 Please don't let Cespedes be hurt, please - James DiChiara (@KingJamesD7) October 1, 2015 @baseball gods don't let Cespedes be seriously hurt \nIt appears the @baseball gods were listening, as Cespedes avoided serious damage to his hand . #Mets calling Cespedes a contusion of his left and ring fingers, but no break. X-rays were negative. What an incredible relief for the team. - Anthony DiComo (@AnthonyDiComo) October 1, 2015 \nAnd all was well in #MetsTwitter land. Well, at least for now. Chalking up Cespedes xray being negative due to the Pope blessing all of America..which also saves the life of a certain Philly tonight #LGM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:48:13.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
