I want to take control of my disease, and I want to be a better man, father and player.\"\nSabathia's departure leaves Ivan Nova as the lone Yankee starter with playoff experience - Nova started one game in the 2011 Division Series against Detroit. While 2015 was not Sabathia's finest season - he finished 6-10 with a 4.73 ERA - he did pitch 167 innings after injuries limited him to just eight starts and 46 innings in 2014.\nSabathia etched himself into Yankees lore with his gutsy performance in the 2009 playoffs, winning three of his four starts - all on three days' rest - and earning AL Championship Series MVP honors. The Yankees won the World Series in the first year of his seven-year, $161 million contract.\nThis year, any postseason heroics will be shelved as Sabathia battles a formidable off-field foe.\n“I want to thank the New York Yankees organization for their encouragement and understanding,\" he said. \"Their support gives me great strength and has allowed me to move forward with this decision with a clear mind.\n“As difficult as this decision is to share publicly, I don’t want to run and hide. But for now please respect my family’s need for privacy as we work through this challenge together.\n“Being an adult means being accountable. Being a baseball player means that others look up to you. I want my kids — and others who may have become fans of mine over the years — to know that I am not too big of a man to ask for help. I want to hold my head up high, have a full heart and be the type of person again that I can be proud of. And that’s exactly what I am going to do.\n“I am looking forward to being out on the field with my team next season playing the game that brings me so much happiness.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf6JYv.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA2eh8&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Cole", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf8fCL.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sabathia", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf2bd1.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Check", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf6pbF.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6BD5t.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rangers", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;This"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:02:04.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
