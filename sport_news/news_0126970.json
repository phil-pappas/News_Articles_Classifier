The Lions are the only team to win a division game against the Patriots over the past four seasons. \n\"They played more of a complete match today,\" said Leonia coach Steven Corn. \"They were definitely fired up about it.\" \nLeonia played to its biggest, or should we say tallest, strength: a Group 1 school with a lineup that features six Lions 5-foot-10 or taller, led by junior middle Maxine Walsh. \nAlva set Walsh in the middle and Walsh responded with a team-high 17 kills. Junior hitter Franceska Gustave had 11 kills and junior middle Briana Cahill 10, with Alva finishing with 40 assists. \n\"We felt we would have a lot of success in the middle, and we tried to really push good ball control, so we'd get more opportunities in the middle for our middle hitters,\" Corn said. \"That worked, they had a lot of success, and my setter kept going to them, knowing that was successful.\" \nLeonia's key was good passing and limiting miscues. The Lions only gave away five points in the first and third sets, but they handed Secaucus 12 points in the second set. Leading 10-8 in the third set, Leonia only made one hitting error the rest of the way. \n\"We sat down at the very beginning of the season, and we put a piece of paper on the wall, and we listed goals we had for this year,\" Corn said. \"And the division title was right at the top of it. They felt they really had a strong chance at it, and they are very close to achieving that.\" \nSecaucus' season is far from over. While the Liberty title may be out of reach, the Patriots still seek to continue their long-running grip on the Hudson County title, as well as repeat as Group 1 champions. \nThe question for Secaucus is: How quickly can a rotation that only has one player over 5-10, senior Alyson Toman — and this week began utilizing five freshmen — develop over the next three weeks? \n\"I said to them, 'Listen, you play like this and you're going to do well, because you're going to improve on this,'\" coach Sheila Rivera told the Patriots. \"It kind of feels like this might be our lineup. We found it. It took us until Oct. 22nd, but we might have found our lineup.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:58:01.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
