Player: Brett MoyerHeight and Weight: 6'3\", 220Graduating Class: 2017Position: Defensive EndCamp attended: Harrisburg (March) Ed O.B.'s take: I actually saw Moyer at another event prior to the PA PREPS All-State camp in March. Even though some of the linemen were bigger than him, Moyer was able to use a combination of strength and speed to go by and around anybody that tried to block him. Moyer finished as one of the top three defensive linemen at the March camp in Harrisburg that featured several legitimate Division I offensive linemen that he faced. Mid-Season thoughts: Moyer has emerged as one of the best defensive linemen in the Berks Inter-County League. Through five games, Moyer has made 30 tackles (22 solo), collected 2 sacks, and blocked one punt. Check out Moyer's game highlights against Susquehannock where he made 8 total tackles (6 solo) and collected one sack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:10:10.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
