Absolutely random,” Deputy Chief Rob Sherwin said. “He just attacked him … It’s just very unusual. It’s quite shocking.” \nOfficers were called shortly before 8 a.m. and found a man stabbed near White Rock Creek Trail underneath Walnut Hill Lane. \nSherwin said police found Johnson after he walked up to the Park Lane Equestrian Center and called 911. \nThe victim, who was not carrying identification, died at a nearby hospital. Sherwin said he is white and between 25 and 35. Police ask that anyone with information contact them. \nThe man was one of two people killed Monday in the White Rock area. Police said the two slayings are not connected at all. \nHomicide Lt. Latoya Porter said a suspect was taken into custody. His name was not released, and neither was a possible motive. \nAt a brief news conference , police took no questions and said the case remains under investigation. \nCrime scene tape stopped several cyclists in their tracks Monday morning. \nCindy Kindel, 58, said she was “leery” of riding the trail alone, even in the daytime. She said the stabbing Monday seemed to confirm her worst fears. \n“It’s so wooded up here and it’s so dense, anyone could come out of the brush at any time here,” she said. \nKindel, who is self-employed and lives in the White Rock area, said she was going to turn around and go home. She said she will be more cautious from now on. \n“It’s iffy to come out here by yourself. I’m in pretty good shape, but that wouldn’t stop anyone from knocking me off the bike,” she said. “I’m very hesitant to come out here. But I felt like it was a bright day, and it was a good time of day to come out here. But I’m always on guard when I’m here.” \nBut Marc Mumby, a Friends of the White Rock Creek Trail board member, said he believed the slaying was “an isolated incident.” \n“The trail is still pretty darn safe,” said Mumby, 63. \nStill, Mumby, who said he has biked the trail regularly for 35 years, said he was disturbed by the news that a man had died. He said he wouldn’t let his wife be alone on the trail at night and encouraged people to take precaution and ride with friends. \n“This is Dallas, and it’s a city, and stuff happens,” he said. “It’s just unfortunate it happened on the trail. It’s a place where people go for recreation and fun.” \nDavid Cole, 55, said the scene was “bizarre.” \n“It makes you stand back a little bit. It’s got to be an anomaly. There’s got to be … some strange story to it.” \nStory courtesy of dallasnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:37:47.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
