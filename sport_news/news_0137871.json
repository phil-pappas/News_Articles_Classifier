He also caught eight passes for 81 yards and a score for Trinity (4-2). \nThe Knights led 6-0 after the first quarter and 38-0 at half. \nThey tacked on eight points in the third and fourth quarters. \n\"It's very important just to get back in the groove and get your timing and get your speed back up,\" Robinson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:36:42.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
