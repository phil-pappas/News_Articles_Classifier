The 12-inch set had finally died.\nInstead of sending the broken television to the dump, the Santa Monica, Calif., filmmaker decided to go on a road trip, hoping to find someone who could fix his most prized possession from childhood.\n\"I bought it for $100 when I was 14,\" Kosareff said. \"I earned the money by selling Christmas Cards. It's one of those objects I just can't let go.\"\nIn \" TV Man: The Search for the Last Independent Dealer,\" a documentary about TV-set culture showing Nov. 5 at Cinema 21 , Kosareff's journey takes a pivotal turn in a Northwest Portland warehouse.\nAt a time when big-box stores and Internet retailers such as Amazon have all but wiped out mom-and-pop TV shops, tracking down a place equipped to repair the vintage Jetlite seemed hopeless.\nWhile driving up the West Coast, however, Kosareff kept hearing the same question from the last of the independent dealers: Have you met Bubby Cronin?\nCronin, owner of Portland's Electrical Distributing Inc. , was once the television king of the Pacific Northwest.\nAfter World War II, he bought into television, convinced that it would become one of history's greatest cultural forces. It wasn't exactly a popular opinion.\nAt the time, the technology was largely dismissed as a sci-fi oddity that wouldn't be able to capture mainstream audiences like radio.\n\"Opinion is no station will broadcast television continuously 18 hours a day as in radio,\" a 1946 article in The Oregonian reported from an entertainment-business convention in Seattle.\nWomen who had seen television, according to the newspaper, worried that daytime shows would prevent them from getting housework done. \"So the televisers are planning educational stuff, how to make a dress, stir up a cake, bathe the baby, build a fire, set out petunias,\" the story reported.\nThe Oregonian/1946 So, an early, more boring version of HGTV.\nElectrical Distributing, which dates back to an 1880s saddlery shop along the Willamette River, wound up selling hundreds of thousands of Zenith TVs from 1945 to the early 1990s.\nCronin is still selling high-end TVs and projectors to home-theater enthusiasts -- as well as barbecue grills, patio furniture and kitchen sinks -- out of his warehouse off U.S. 30.\nAnd, at 85, he's on his own quest: He wants to collect and preserve every U.S.-made Zenith model he sold before Korea-based LG took over the company to acquire it's high-definition patents in 1995.\nAt first glance, Cronin's aging collection of Zeniths isn't all that inspiring.\nBubby Cronin in his Portland TV museum Electrical Distributing Inc. owner Bubby discusses his extensive collection of U.S.-made Zeniths from 1948 to 1995.\nLast week, the bulky relics, many weighing hundreds of pounds, were crammed into a windowless room inside Electrical Distributing warehouse. They appeared to be technological relics waiting for a trip to Goodwill.\nBut with a turn of a knob, magic happened. \"Still works,\" Cronin said as the porthole screen of a coffee-and-milk-colored model slowly woke up.\nAn electric whine cut through the set's wood cabinet. From a black-and-white snowstorm of static, a blurry image of Ricky Ricardo singing \"I Love Lucy\" emerged on the itty-bitty screen.\nCronin's linebacker frame, boxy and brawny like his electrical antiques, towered over the console. Cronin, whose hair is evocative of yesteryear's white TV static, dusted off a service-with-a-smile sales pitch. He raved about how Zenith's \"Giant Circle Television\" was the only set truly ready for Portland's first UHF signal in 1952.\nWhen Kosareff drove into Portland with his inoperative Jetlite TV, Cronin invoted him to take a similar tour of private museum. The filmmaker was in awe.\n\"He is the TV Man,\" Kosareff said. \"His knowledge of old TVs, his love of the history and the technology, his collection – it wasn't just job for him. I wanted to capture it.\"\nKosareff, author of \"Window to the Future: The Golden Age of Television Marketing and Advertising,\" wound up filming half of his self-financed $100,000 documentary in Portland.\nYou will have to see the film to find out whether Cronin could fix the Jetlite.\nIf nothing else, Kosareff said seeing the collection of working Zeniths prompted him to take a more philosophical approach to his exercise in nostalgia.\n\"TV Man\" is loaded with vintage ads, interviews and humorous anecdotes from former repairman (sliding off roofs during antenna installs, being hit on by lonely housewives, bullet holes in sets: You name it.)\nBut Cronin's collection is a reminder of a bygone era when watching television was a cultural event and more communal, Kosareff said.\nThe filmmaker wanted to pay tribute to a time when every family member didn't have his or her own portable screen, headphones and personalized Netflix account.\n\"It's a combination of time travel and family reunion,\" he said.\n— Joseph Rose\n503-221-8029\njrose@oregonian.com\n@josephjrose", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpDSfUJDnSE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/6yShZGNb5vQ", "http://twitter.com/josephjrose", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1422366332"], "published": "2015-10-26T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:22:44.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
