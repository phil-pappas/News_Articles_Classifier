A lower court judge rejected the city's argument, ruling that baseball could withhold its approval for the Athletics to move under the league's longstanding antitrust exemption.\nIn its ruling in January, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco also cited Major League Baseball's unique antitrust status.\nThe Oakland A's have struggled with weak ticket sales in the Oakland Coliseum, which the team shares with the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League.\nSan Jose, the biggest city in affluent Silicon Valley, has longed for a Major League Baseball franchise for years. The city has offered the Athletics land for a baseball park while also pressing the league to have owners of the other teams vote to allow the Athletics to move.\nTired of waiting for a vote, San Jose sued Major League Baseball, saying its \"illegal and collusive actions thwarted plaintiffs' diligent efforts to procure a major league baseball team for Silicon Valley.\"\nMajor League Baseball did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe case is City of San Jose v. Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-1252.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:39:05.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
