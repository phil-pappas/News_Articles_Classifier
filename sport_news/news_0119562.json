They finish up the regular season with a road game against Dieruff on Saturday and a home matchup against Northampton on Wednesday as they look to secure their spot in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference playoffs. \nAfter Emmaus scored in the final seconds to tie Nazareth on Saturday and Whitehall posted a win over the Blue Eagles on Tuesday, the performance against Central Catholic was just what Nazareth needed. \n\"I think it's going to pick us up. Give us the momentum to carry us through and hopefully do well in district playoffs,\" Lunt said. \n\"Overall, our energy level is up and we'll go out hard in the next games,\" Strauser said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:19:04.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
