You are forgiven if you don't know the answer — it was, after all, six years and two conferences ago.\nThe Scarlet Knights haven't beaten one of the top 25 teams in the country since Nov. 12, 2009, when it thrashed then No. 24 South Florida, 31-0, at High Point Solutions Stadium in a Big East (remember that?) game.\nThat's right. It's been 2,157 days, and while they haven't played as many ranked opponents then as you might think, they are 0-8 against them and the average margin of defeat is more than three touchdowns.\nIt is a streak that this program needs to end to regain respect on a national stage, and here comes another opportunity: No. 4 Michigan State comes to Piscataway on Saturday night, and while Vegas isn't giving Rutgers much love — they are still 13 1/2-point underdogs — the Scarlet Knights do have plenty in their favor.\nThey are coming off a bye week. They are playing at home with the school promoting a special \"Blackout the Birthplace\" to create what should be a great atmosphere. They will have the emotional lift from team captain Leonte Carroo returning to the field , not to mention his impact on the offense.\nMeanwhile, the Spartans have issues. They've already lost three key players to season-ending injuries and several more are expected to miss this game. Purdue is one of the worst teams in the Big Ten, but the Boilermakers outscored the Spartans 21-3 in the second half last week and only lost by a field goal.\nRELATED: Leonte Carroo will make the most of his second chance\nPeople are concerned in East Lansing, Mich., especially with the rival Wolverines looking pretty strong down the road. (Note: The Spartans are also 30-3 in their last 33 games under Mark Dantonio. Oh, to have such problems!)\n\"You just play the games,\" Dantonio told reporters this week . \"You can't promise people that you're going to win. You can't promise people that you'll cover the spread. What you can do is promise people that you're going to play the very best you can, that you play with effort and toughness.\"\nIt was interesting that Dantonio mentioned covering the spread, because Michigan State is just one of five teams in the country that have yet to win a game against the Vegas line. That's a pretty good indication that they haven't lived up to outside expectations.\nWill that matter on Saturday? Who knows. It could mean that the Spartans are simply due for a good performance, and that Rutgers will once again be a victim of bad timing against a better Big Ten opponent.\nStill: If the Scarlet Knights don't win, wouldn't a moral victory be nice? No, it won't help get them bowl eligible, but given all that's happened lately to this program a close game in the fourth quarter would certainly be a welcome moment for the fan base.\nIndiana took No. 1 Ohio State to the final play last week, losing when a pass from its backup quarterback fell incomplete. This is Kyle Flood's least favorite stat, but here it is again: Rutgers was outscored 180-44 against the top four teams in the Big Ten East a year ago.\n\"We coach the games to win,\" Flood, who will serve the final game of a three-game suspension this week, said after a 45-3 loss in East Lansing a year ago. \"We don't coach the games to be close.\"\nI wasn't sure how that made any sense then, and I'm still not sure now. The Spartans not only called a fake field goal against Rutgers in that game when they were up 35-0 in the third quarter, but ran a reverse to their right guard with seven minutes left.", "external_links": ["http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/lynn-henning/2015/10/06/henning-dantonio-spartans-happily-take-record/73490342/"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:33:32.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
