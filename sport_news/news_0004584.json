Schipper's Rams won their defensive battle over the Tigers, 2-1, as St. Mary's Brianne Martinez scored the game-winning goal with 2 minutes, 32 seconds remaining. When the St. Mary's boys team defeated Tokay 15-6, it completed a season sweep for the Rams as TCAL competition nears completion. With three league games left, the Rams girls (9-6, 5-1 TCAL) remain in contention with Lincoln and Lodi for the championship, while the boys (10-7, 4-1) are a game behind Lodi. In Monday's girls game, the Rams held a1-0 lead before Tokay (8-8, 3-3) tied it on a long desperation shot by Nicole Iturraran with 5:46 remaining. Minutes later, Martinez took her time before firing the winning strike as the shot clock expired. It was the first game-winning shot in Martinez's career. \"I felt really happy because we didn't have to go to overtime,\" the senior Martinez said. \"I saw an opening and everyone else was pressed. I just took (the shot).\" Rams coach Shane Mahoney praised Martinez for her strength. \"We've been wanting her to shoot more because she has one of the hardest shots on the team,\" Mahoney said. Tokay coach Sarah Watt said it would have been nice to avenge its previous 6-3 loss to St. Mary's on Sept. 30. \"This would've changed our season had we won,\" Watt said. \"We did everything we needed to do on defense, but we needed an offensive attack to match it. In the cage, Julia is fearless. She's the center of our defense.\" Schipper, a junior, said it was intense to be part of such a low-scoring affair. \"I had faith in my team that we'd pull through in those last few minutes,\" she said. In the boys game, the Tigers (10-8, 4-3) matched the Rams' effort in the first quarter when Nick Kleinert's first of three goals leveled the score at 3 each. However, the Rams would score nine consecutive goals as they successfully converted their first seven shots of the second quarter. Freshman Matthew Hosmer and junior Jory Parker scored four goals apiece for St. Mary's. St. Mary's goalie Blake Martin also drew praise from Mahoney after the senior blocked 20 shots. Said Mahoney: \"I thought it was one of his best games of the year.\" By Kevin Niendorf", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:08:24.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
