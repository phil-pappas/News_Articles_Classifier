Button Down, who was also mentioned as a runner, was instead entered in the E.P. Taylor Stakes earlier on the card. \nHabibi was also nominated to the 1 1/4-mile Taylor, but instead will line up for the International as the lone female runner. \n\"Her best distance is a mile and a half,\" trainer Mark Frostad said. \"Her past two races have been at a mile and a half and it will be hard to go back on that.\" \nThe name may be Arabic (for someone you have an affection for), but this six-year-old lady is a product of New Zealand. She showed a lot of quality in her native country early in her career, winning six of seven including the 2013 New Zealand Derby. She also raced twice in Australia. \nShe was sent to North America after that win, making one start at Santa Anita last year and starting her season in California this past winter. After arriving at Frostad's barn, her Woodbine debut was a second in an optional claiming event. \nShe distinguished herself the wrong way in the Singspiel, last of eight, but bounced right back with a win in the Flaming Page Stakes. That set her up for an impressive outing in the Northern Dancer Turf on Woodbine Mile day, where despite being sent off at 17-1, she came from nearly last to finish second behind fellow International competitor Interpol. \n\"She really closed well and beat some good horses,\" Frostad said. \"She's fared very well on the turf course here at Woodbine and we've been really happy with her.\" \n\"If she stays to that last race, she'll be competitive.\" \nRobby Albarado will come north to ride the George Strawbridge-owned mare who is looking to become the 10th female horse to win the race. She is 10-1 in the morning line. \nSecond Step, the recent winner of a Group 1 race in Germany, is the 3-1 morning-line choice followed by Cannock Chase at 7-2. Sheikhzayedroad is 6-1. Interpol leads the local contingent at 8-1. At 10-1 are Danish Dynaformer, Triple Threat, and former Canadian horse of the year Up With The Birds. \nAt longer prices are Kaigun (12-1), Power Ped (20-1), and Reporting Star (20-1). \nMORE BIG FIELDS \nThe turf will get a real pounding as the two other features have come up full. Button Down is among 12 who will contest the E.P. Taylor, led by 3-1 morning-line favourite Curvy, a graded stakes winner in England and in Ireland earlier this season. Canadian Stakes winner Strut The Course leads the local contingent at 4-1. \nThe $300,000 Nearctic Stakes drew 11. The lone European is Terror, a two-time winner out of the barn of David Simcock. \nAnd a field of 10 were entered in the $150,000 Ontario Fashion Stakes for fillies and mares going six furlongs on polytrack. \nCROWN WORK \nEliminations for the Breeders' Crown also will take place at Woodbine on the weekend. Seven of the 12 races on Friday night's card will be elimination heats for two-year-olds. Juvenile stars Southwind Frank, Pure Country, Caprice Hill, and Control The Moment will be in action. \nSaturday's card has six elimination heats. Stars there include North America Cup winners Wakizashi Hanover and Jk Endofanera. Eight of the 12 divisions required elimination heats. The finals will take place on Oct. 24.
