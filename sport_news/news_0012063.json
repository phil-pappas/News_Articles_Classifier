The former NBA basketball player was hospitalized after he was found unconscious Tuesday at a Nevada brothel, authorities said. (AP Photo/David Becker) \nLamar Odom continues to be on life support but there is now a bit of good news with regards to the condition of the former NBA cager. \nIt seems that tests made on Odom Friday shows that his heart function is much better. According to doctors through a report from TMZ, this is a good sign since a critical organ is responding. \nBut despite the positive development, doctors are urging for calm in Odom’s room and that they do not want him stimulated. Per Odom’s attending doctors, non-stimulation promotes healing. \nHence for now, doctors have barred anyone from having access to Odom’s room though it is believed that Khloe Kardashian remains by his bedside. \nThe latest development regarding Odom’s condition since being found unresponsive at a Love Ranch in a brothel in Nevada last Wednesday does offer a big sigh of relief since previous reports gave him only a 50/50 chance of surviving. \nOdom, who had reportedly consumed cocaine as well as a herbal substitute for Viagra, had four vital organs failing and that he was not breathing on his own. \nHis condition was likened to the case of the late Bobbi Kristina Brown only that Odom did not lose oxygen to his brain. \nFor those who missed the official report from the Nevada Sherriff on the 911 call, you can view the video below. Update: Odom opens eyes, speaks \nAfter an earlier report revealing that Lamar Odom’s heart was functioning, Entertainment Tonight reveals that the former NBA player and TV reality star has opened his eyes and was able to speak. \nSuch was revealed by Alvina Alston, the spokesperson for Odom’s aunt JaNean Mercer. \nAccording to the spokesperson, a doctor asked Lamar how he was doing and the former cager responded with a thumbs up while also responding with a “Good Morning”. \nAside from that, Odom had reportedly indicated of wanting to see his two children, Destiny (17) and Lamar Jr. (13). \nAs of this writing, doctors are trying to determine if Odom can breathe on his own with the aid of a mask. They will still try to put him back and forth on the ventilator to see if he can breathe without heavy life support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:45:57.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
