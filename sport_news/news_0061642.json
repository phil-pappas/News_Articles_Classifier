Forecasters say some areas could see storm totals as high as 15 inches.\nMeteorologists say once the rain ends, the threat of flooding persists because the ground is too saturated to absorb water. And high winds could bring down trees like the one that hit a vehicle near Fayetteville, North Carolina, killing a passenger.\nThe storm also has been linked to a drowning in Spartanburg, South Carolina.\nFlood watches and warnings also are in effect in Delaware and parts of New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:38:01.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
