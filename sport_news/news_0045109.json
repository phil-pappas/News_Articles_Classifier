It was a great way to start the year.” \nShipley said that the ground blind was set up strategically when a Reconyx game camera showed several shooter bucks showing up in an area with good regularity. \nIn addition to the buck that Shipley killed last fall, Bucks of Tecomate show co-host David Morris also used a ground blind to his advantage in the Sunflower State. \n“There was one deer showing up that we called Coke Bottle because he had such massive bases,” said Shipley. “David had hunted that deer two or three years previously and it had nearly six-inch bases. \n“After getting the deer on camera, David got in a blind, the buck showed up the first afternoon of filming and David killed it.” \nIf it sounds like ground blinds can be great hunting tools, they can be. \nBut after using them for years in Texas, Shipley warns that in his mind, there is far more to effectively using one than setting it up, climbing in and beginning to hunt. \n“I brush stuff in to the point that I might as well have a brush blind only,” laughed Shipley. “Pop-up ground blinds have a rectangular shape with hard edges to them, something that stands out to game animals. From my experience, it’s something that they certainly notice and pay attention to.” \nBecause of that, the surrounding brush and cedar trees should be worried when Shipley shows up with a ground blind in one hand and a handsaw in the other. \n“I try to make them look as natural as possible, especially when I’m hunting whitetails out of one,” said Shipley. “I pick two primary shooting lanes to use and then the rest of the blind is walled off (with brush). \n“I can see through the other windows to observe deer coming and going, but I’m not going to use them to shoot through.” \nWhere are the best spots to utilize a ground blind for a whitetail? \n“It depends on what time of year it is and what the current deer behavior patterns are,” said Shipley. “It gets trickier during the rut because they can show up just about anywhere and run through an area, so it’s harder (to plan for where to put one). \n“But in general, I like to set a ground blind up on the downwind side of a food plot or other food source, based on what the prevailing winds are in the area,” he added. \nAs director of sponsor relations for the Tecomate Seed company, it is no surprise that Shipley often hunts next to a Tecomate food plot on his Texas hunts. \nBut in other parts of the Great Plains as the crew films various deer hunts, preferred food sources can range from an oak tree dropping acorns, a persimmon tree that has fruit on it, new growth browse after an early autumn rain or even a corn feeder spitting out golden nuggets (in states where such practices are legal). \n“Find the preferred food source,” said Shipley. “Then try to find a high traffic deer trail leading into and out of that food source. Finally, set up your blind — with the wind taken into consideration — where you can draw undetected and get a good shot as the deer are coming through.” \nIf brushing a ground blind in to where it disappears and putting it in the right location are a couple of keys to using such blinds effectively, Shipley says that another is being extra careful with human scent while hunting on the ground. \n“I always play the wind right, setting up a stand on the downwind side of things,” said Shipley. “And I go through the usual routine of showering in scent free soap before my hunt, making sure my clothes are washed in scent free detergent, not putting my hunting clothes on until I’ve arrived at the hunting spot, etc.” \nAny more keys to consider? Yes says Shipley. \n“When you get into the blind, especially the first time, you want to figure out where and how you need to be positioned to get an shot through a window without hitting it,” said Shipley. “I’ll test things out by drawing my Hoyt bow back several times with an arrow nocked, seeing where any problem areas might be.” \nHe has learned to do that from experience, drawing a bow back on past hunts and finding out that he didn’t have enough room to draw, was hitting the blind with either his elbow or the broadhead tipped end of the arrow or didn’t have the right angle to film from. \n“Another thing to remember is that as with all stands, the best time to kill a big mature buck out of a ground blind is the first time you go in there,” said Shipley. “You have to go in there with that mindset as a hunter, at least. \nWell grounded in his life after football, Shipley can smile big these days. \nEspecially when another big whitetail comes calling, trotting by a well hidden ground blind.
