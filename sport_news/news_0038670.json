Canucks goaltender Ryan Miller made 29 saves for the win.\n\"That's a pretty good road game to start the year against a good team in a tough building,\" Sutter said.\nJiri Hudler replied for the Flames with Karri Ramo stopping 39 of 44 shots in the loss.\nThe two clubs square off again Saturday in Vancouver for the second of their five meetings this season in the Pacific Division.\nCalgary was outshot 44-30. The game turned on Daniel Sedin's goal late in the second period and an own-goal by Calgary in the third.\nA Dan Hamhuis shot deflected off Ramo, then Sedin's leg and into Calgary's net to make it 3-1 with five seconds left in the second period.\nFlames defenceman Dennis Wideman knocked down a long, off-speed shot by Burrows, but tipped it past Ramo at 8:17 of the third to make it 4-1 for the visitors.\n\"That was probably as bad as we can get out there,\" Flames captain Mark Giordano said. \"We turned over a lot of pucks.\"\nHenrik Sedin scored Vancouver's final goal of the night on a sharp-angled wrist shot at 16:31 of the third period.\nThe Flames trailing 2-0, Hudler halved the deficit at 3:39 of the second.\nSutter batted a rebound out of the air past Ramo with a deft touch at 18:01 of the first period to make it 2-0 for his new team.\n\"Never really scored one like that before, but I'll take it,\" Sutter said. \"I'd say 99 times out of 100 you miss it, but I was fortunate enough to get a stick on it.\"\nThe Canucks dealt forward Nick Bonino, defenceman Adam Clendening and a draft pick to Pittsburgh in July to obtain Sutter, who is the son of former Calgary Flames head coach Brent Sutter.\nHansen took Hutton's cross-ice, stretch pass along the boards and beat Ramo top corner glove side with a blast from the top of the circle at 10:34.\nCalgary's Micheal Ferland and Vancouver's Derek Dorsett dropped the gloves two seconds after the opening faceoff. Flames winger Brandon Bollig and Canucks forward Brandon Prust then traded punches eight minutes into the game.\nNotes: The Flames fell to 0-5-1 in their last six season-openers and have lost their last two to the Canucks . . . Calgary's scratches were forward Mason Raymond and goalie Joni Ortio; Vancouver's were forward Jake Virtanen, defenceman Yannick Weber and goalie Jakob Markstrom.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:18:52.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
