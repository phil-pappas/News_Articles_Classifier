BC can keep things simple by winning its remaining games and locking up a postseason berth. Standing in the way of the Leos success is the Hamilton Tiger-Cats . The first place team in the East will aim to put a dent in the Leos chances tonight.\nDefensive Back Ryan Phillips says the team needs to put in a full four quarter effort tonight.\n“It is up to the guys in the locker room. We need to go out there and play hard. We have to play hard for more than three and half quarters. Playing three quarters of a game doesn’t do anything for us especially in the win column.”\nAndrew Harris leads the CFL in rushing yards and he knows he needs to have a big game against the Tabbies.\n“For us, it is about controlling the ball and having great ball security. We also need to make smart decisions with the throws we do make. We have to start fast and match their intensity if not better. We have to sustain that momentum for 60 minutes.”\nEven with Travis Lulay nearing 100-per cent health, Jonathon Jennings will get the start at the quarterback position. Jennings says he needs to come out firing to get the win.\n“We just need to take care of things we can control. Hamilton is going to make some big plays on defence. We just need to make sure we hold the ball tight and not make stupid mistakes. You can’t give up the ball and you can’t turn it over. We need to eliminate those mistakes and go out there and execute.\nIn their one previous meeting this season the Tiger-Cats crushed the Lions 52-22 in Hamilton.\nKick off is at 7 p.m. at BC Place.\nbc lions | CFL | football | Hamilton | lions", "external_links": ["http://ticats.ca/", "http://www.bclions.com/"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:37:22.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
