Warren’s Deloraine-based team defeated East St. Paul’s Carl German 8-1 to earn a berth in the senior’s men provincial championship. (TIM SMITH/BRANDON SUN) \nMurray Warren became the winningest skip in the 18-year history of the Neil Andrews Legends Classic curling bonspiel and earned a senior men’s provincial berth in the process on the weekend. \nThe 60-year-old, who lives just outside of Medora, and his Deloraine-based team of Brian Barker, Terry Warren and Reg Warren rolled off five straight wins to capture this year’s championship. They capped their run with an 8-1 victory over East St. Paul’s Carl German in Sunday’s final at the Brandon Curling Club. \nWinning the bonspiel was a big accomplishment for a team that hadn’t played a full game together before the event and left the skip feeling pretty good. \n\"For sure. I never thought it would work out like that,\" Murray Warren said. \"We started a little slow and we played Carl the first game and he beat us pretty good. Every time we got down we seemed to claw our way into games and we played pretty good.\" \nThe Neil Andrews Legends Classic, which was dedicated to the memory of Don Sumner this year, wasn’t just a test for Warren’s team but for himself. After undergoing stress tests and an angiogram last winter, Warren had a quintuple bypass in March. \nThis bonspiel was his first real test on the ice since the surgery. He felt he passed it pretty well. \n\"I feel pretty good now other than my legs. My one leg still bothers me a bit,\" said Warren, who started playing golf in July and also helped with the harvest. \"I was hoping to get back on the ice again, but didn’t figure I’d start this good.\" \nWarren’s team qualified for Sunday’s playoffs with a 2-1 record in their pool, along with German. Warren then beat Butch Mouck 6-5 in the quarter-finals and Ron Westcott 5-3 in the semifinals. \nHe stole two in the opening end of the final and three more in the third to jump out to a 6-0 advantage. After forcing German to one in the fourth, Warren got a key miss from German’s third the next end that allowed him to draw for two instead of facing five with his last. They shook hands after that. \nIn addition to claiming his third Neil Andrews Legends Classic title —he won the men’s event in 2002 and in 2011 when it was just a seniors’ competition —Warren’s team took home $2,400 and earned a spot at the senior men’s provincial championship, which will run from Feb. 24-29 at Winnipeg’s Fort Rouge Curling Club. \nEarning that berth has altered Warren’s approach for the rest of the season. \n\"There will be a few things we probably won’t go into,\" he said. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:23:37.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
