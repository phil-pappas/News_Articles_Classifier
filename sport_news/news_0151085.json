He was involved in a fracas and Chilean referee Enrique Osses reported him for insulting him in the players’ tunnel.\nThe gifted forward served the first two matches of his suspension in other matches Brazil played at the tournament, including their quarter-final defeat by Paraguay on penalties.\n(Reporting by Rex Gowar ; editing by Clare Fallon )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:05:25.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
