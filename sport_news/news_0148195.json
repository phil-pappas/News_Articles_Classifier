Stacy Long , Montgomery Advertiser 7:31 a.m. CDT October 8, 2015 Detavion Galmer is known as \"Box\" to his fellow Alabama State Hornets due to his box cut, hi-top fade hairdo.

Nor did Detavion Galmer provide any resistance. \nWhy fight the inevitable? \nSoon after Galmer set foot on campus last year, fresh out of high school, the Hornets quickly settled the biggest question any freshman player faces. \nIt took little more than a glance at Galmer for the Hornets to decide on the defensive end’s nickname. \n“Everybody calls him Box,” linebacker Kourtney Berry said. “That’s just the nickname we all gave him because of the simple fact he has a box cut. \n“He’s Box.” \nVoila, it was done. \nBecause Galmer’s calling card, at least away from the football field, is in the tradition of Kid ‘n Play. \nGalmer first sported a hi-top fade when he was a sophomore in high school and going away to college wasn’t going to change that. \n“Fashions and styles change, but I believe if it’s not broke, don’t fix it,” Galmer said. “Everybody likes it. The girls like it. My mom likes it.” ASU defensive end Detavion Galmer previews Southern, the Hornets' opponent Saturday. Stacy Long \nIt’s growing on the Hornets, too. \nGalmer, after redshirting last year, has five sacks through the first five games of his college career. \nSuch productivity means he can keep the hairstyle of his choice, without too much ridicule. \n“Whatever makes Box tick, that’s what makes him tick,” said first-year ASU coach Brian Jenkins, who was initially unsure why Galmer was known as “Box” until the instant he met him. \n“I know I can’t grow mine like that,” Jenkins said. “I joke with him all the time: ‘Hey, that’s not always going to last, buddy. \n“Enjoy it now.” \nThough they saw Galmer’s potential, both Berry and Jenkins said they had to encourage Galmer to reach it. \nAs a redshirt without hope of playing time last year, Galmer “didn’t practice up to where he could practice,” Berry said. Early this season, Jenkins met with Galmer and challenged him, too. \n“He saw that we thought a lot more of him than he was thinking of himself,” Jenkins said. “Because of that, I think his focus changed a little bit, and he’s been able to produce. \n“Hopefully, he can stay consistent. If he can do that, I think he can help us.” \nGalmer his first career sack — and two more — against Grambling. Last week at Texas Southern, he had two sacks. \nGalmer enters Saturday’s game with Southern with seven tackles, of which six are for a loss. \n“At the end of the game, it says ‘Detavion Galmer has a certain amount of sacks,’ but it’s the rest of the D-linemen and linebackers, too,” Galmer said. “The whole defense is like a puzzle and every piece is important.” 20 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1Rvzwjf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:10:26.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
