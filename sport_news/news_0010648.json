The foundation does fundraising for the university.\nLouisville President James Ramsey also said Thursday he ''fully'' supports athletic director Tom Jurich ''as we work to identify the facts in this situation.'' Ramsey reiterated the school has hired former NCAA enforcement official Chuck Smrt to lead the athletic department's investigation.\nMen's basketball spokesman Kenny Klein had no comment on a CBS Sports report that former Cardinals recruit JaQuan Lyle, now an Ohio State freshman, confirmed the ''gist of allegations'' detailed in Katina Powell's book during a meeting Tuesday with the NCAA.\nLyle originally signed with Louisville before de-committing and eventually landing with the Buckeyes. OSU spokesman Dan Wallenberg confirmed the NCAA meeting via email on Wednesday but said there were no issues with Ohio State. He did not mention Louisville.\nPowell's book, ''Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen'' was released online last weekend by a publishing affiliate of the Indianapolis Business Journal. A hardcover version of the 104-page book is scheduled for release on Monday.\nThe book states that McGee hired Powell and other dancers, including three of her daughters, for 22 shows allegedly performed from 2010 to 2014 at the players' Billy Minardi Hall dormitory.\nMcGee left Louisville in 2014 for Missouri-Kansas City, which placed him on paid leave Friday. A message left Thursday with his Louisville attorney, Scott C. Cox, was not immediately returned. A spokeswoman for IBJ's publishing arm could not be reached either.\nLouisville coach Rick Pitino has said McGee denied Powell's allegations. In a radio interview Tuesday he denied knowledge of what took place and said last week that others he talked to didn't know about the activities described in the book.\n''I'm going through 15 people who worked here, and not one person even had a premonition of something wrong,'' Pitino said Friday. ''Not one person living in the dorm had even the slightest premonition. It just doesn't make sense to me.''\nThe Hall of Fame coach wasn't mentioned in Ramsey's statement in which the chancellor praised Jurich's athletic program as ''exemplary'' at the school.\n''It is important that the university - all of us - stay focused on our day-to-day work of providing our outstanding students with a world-class education,'' Ramsey said. ''The investigation of the allegations may take time and we must, as one university, continue doing the work we do to move our university and our community forward.''\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:55:03.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
