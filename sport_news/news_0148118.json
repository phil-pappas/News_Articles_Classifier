Greg Abbott (left) and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (right) Governor Greg Abbott is challenging the governor of Oklahoma to a Texas-OU barbecue wager as the Texas Longhorns prepare to take on the Oklahoma Sooners this weekend in Dallas. Abbott is betting Gov. Mary Fallin that the loser of Saturday's game must donate food to a charity in the opposing governor's state. Longhorn's Mascot Ill, Will Not Attend TX-OU Game \"The friendly rivalry between the State of Texas and the State of Oklahoma runs deep, especially when it comes to football,\" Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement. \"In the history of the Red River Rivalry, the Texas Longhorns have come away with more victories than Oklahoma ever has, and I expect this Saturday to be no different. In the unfortunate event the Sooners pull off a win, the Oklahoma City Rescue Mission will receive some of the finest barbecue Texas has to offer - a prize valued far more than any trophy.\" If UT wins, Gov. Fallin and Head Country Bar-B-Q will sponsor 600 meals to be served at the Capital Area Food Bank in Austin. UT Player Apologizes for Halftime Tweet \"I felt a little bad about accepting this bet because UT doesn't stand a chance,\" Governor Fallin said in a statement. \"The Sooners are going to bring home a win, and a lot of barbecue from Texas for the City Rescue Mission. In the unlikely case we see a UT upset, Head Country Barb-B-Q and I will console ourselves by knowing we are supporting a good cause in Austin.\" If OU wins, Gov. Abbott will send a shipment of Railhead BBQ from Fort Worth to City Rescue Mission, a non-profit partnering with the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, in Oklahoma City. The AT&T Red River Showdown kicks at 11 a.m. Saturday at the Cotton Bowl.
