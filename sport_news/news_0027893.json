For the 3rd and 4th graders from the Montrose area, Thursday night's game had a bigger meaning. \nJust eight days ago, 3rd grader Wyatt Hanisch was diagnosed with a highly aggressive brain tumor. His family says Wyatt was more disappointed he couldn't play football than his diagnosis. Thursday, the community is doing their best to support Wyatt. \nAll the eyes are on the field tonight, but all the thoughts and prayers are with the 3rd grader on the sidelines. Fans cheer on their team while wearing shirts with Wyatt's Number 73. \n\"Could make a lot of tackles and he could stop a lot of runners. He was brave out there,\" Connor McGuire said. \nNow his bravery is focused on fighting the disease. Even though he can't play, Wyatt still contributes to the team. He gets the tee when his team kicks off after they score a touchdown, which they did a lot tonight. \n\"He's been our good luck charm,\" Head Coach Jay McGuire said. \nWyatt shares words of encouragement with his teammates at halftime. Quarterback Connor McGuire says Wyatt isn't just a teammate, he's a friend. \n\"Our school is doing a lot of stuff to raise money for him and I hope he gets better,\" Connor said. \nHead Coach Jay McGuire isn't surprised looking at the sideline and seeing a sea of green shirts supporting Wyatt. \n\"We are a team and that goes up to the parents and everybody and so when it's time to be a team we bind together and we are a team,\" Coach McGuire said. \nThe team won the game 27-12 to move on to the next round of the playoffs. While the win is nice, tonight was more about giving Wyatt two hours to forget about his situation, and just have fun. \n\"He's inspired me to be a good coach. Sometimes I think when you're coaching you kind of forget what it is about. It's about the kids. It's about making them better. Not just as football players, but in everything they do,\" Jay said. \nA 3rd grader who's giving life lessons to his coach. \nThere is an account set up for Wyatt's family at the Security State Bank in Montrose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:03:55.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
