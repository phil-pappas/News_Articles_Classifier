Carried on a napkin by his beloved owner and lone pallbearer to the heavenly sewers that await him, her sister recorded the procession and egged her sister on.\nIn loving memory of Nemo, Jaylah sang Nemo's favorite song before his final swim – Fetty Wap’s 679 .\nHer sister, perhaps the world’s worst funeral director, first posted a snippet of the funeral on Twitter Oct. 14, tweeting it to Jimmy Fallon.\n@jimmyfallon My little sister had a funeral for her Goldfish Nemo. Their favorite song was 679 by Fetty Wap pic.twitter.com/Cd2Bu5wNlw\n— Jazzïe (@Jazziejayy_) October 15, 2015 Jaylah’s sister, Jazmyne, posted the entire funeral on YouTube on Oct. 17 .\nNo word on if she’s gotten a new goldfish, or where their parents were at the time of the funeral.\nR.I.P.
