Last week, Ouachita came from behind to beat the previously perfect Harding Bison 26-21 and Henderson State ended Arkansas Tech’s streak in a 17-7 victory. The GAC currently has a five teams tied for first place with a 4-1 record. “It is a good conference for sure and very equal,” Ouachita Baptist University head football coach Todd Knight said. “Anybody can beat anybody on any given night and that makes it a lot of fun.” Last week, a late touchdown catch by Johnathan Powell, his first of the season, put the Tigers in front 24-21 against Harding and Barkley Legens sacked Bison quarterback Park Parish for a safety in the final minute to secure the win. This Saturday at 3 p.m. in Russellville, Ouachita will play at Arkansas Tech. “They have a good football team and I don’t know if you stop them, you just have to control them,” Knight said. “Their quarterback is big and he’s physical. They are running football team, but I think they got behind last week and threw it. They run an Auburn fast-tempo style and do a good job with it. They are very good on special teams and they are good on defense. They had one of the best defenses in the league last year and they are still playing really good defense if you look at them statistically.” Last week against Henderson, Arkansas Tech quarterback Arsenio Favor threw a touchdown pass to Michael Fine in the last minute of the game. The Wonder Boys are averaging more than 450 yards per game in total offense this year. Defensively, Cua’ Rose intercepted a Henderson pass, but the Arkansas Tech defense allowed 390 yards to Henderson’s offense, 305 of those were rushing yards. The Wonder Boys were also penalized nine times for 60 yards. “It’s a big game it is their homecoming and it will be packed,” Knight said. “They are tied for first, it is on the road, I mean there are a lot of things we have to overcome and the guys know that. We are looking forward to going up there and playing a big game on the road. We like that atmosphere and we are excited about that part of it, but we realize it is like that every week and you have to play your best football. This week is another one of those weeks.” The assignment for the Tigers is simple, play smart and physical. “We have to play assignment football, we can’t turn the ball over, we have to play really sound defense, we cant give up those big plays and if we do that, I think we will have a shot,” Knight said. Page 2 of 2 - Austin Warford orchestrated the Tigers offensive and passing plays. He is third in the GAC in rushing currently, behind Ouachita running back Kris Oliver. Defensively, Legens, Waymon Johnson, Jahlon Mitchell led the charge into Harding’s backfield most of the game and Knight says that type of physical play was a positive. “I thought our defense was very physical once we caught up to the speed of their option,” he said. “Offensively we able to continue to run the ball and we threw the ball well. Austin was on point and had a great game. I thought we were solid in all three phases and did some good things on special teams.” Arkansas Tech presents an more spread option type of attack offensively. “It is almost like playing an option team,” Knight said. “Really they are they are just a spread option who runs the football like that and you don’t want to get behind on them or you won’t get as many possessions. It will be a quick game like last week, because naturally both teams are going to run it. We are a lot alike if you look at us offensively it will be a quick one and each possession is going to be very important.” Arkansas Tech leads the series all time against Ouachita 41-30-8, but since joining the GAC, the Tigers are 4-0. Last year Ouachita won 14-9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:15:18.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
