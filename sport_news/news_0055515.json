(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) \nLONDON (AP) — Arsenal ended a run of two consecutive defeats in the Champions League with a morale-boosting 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich in Group F on Tuesday. \nSubstitute Olivier Giroud scored in the 77th minute at the Emirates Stadium, bundling the ball into the net after Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer rushed off his line and failed to claim a free kick from Santi Cazorla. \nThe ball appeared to come off Giroud’s arm last, after first hitting his head as he dived to make contact. \nMesut Ozil scored the second in added time, converting a cross from Hector Bellerin which Neuer pushed out after it had crossed the line. \nNeuer made an astounding first half save from a Theo Walcott header six yards out, diving to claw the ball off the line.
