The Lady Patriots and Lady Raiders were too far down in the Region 5- standings and the Lady Spartans were beat out for the fourth seed by Alexander.In Class , the Lady Wolfpack were on the verge of making the playoffs but North Cobb, Kennesaw Mountain, Hillgrove and Harrison were a little stronger on the court.“We just want to make Paulding County proud and have a good showing,” Hiram volleyball coach Kevin Thomas said. “Win or lose, we just want to play good volleyball.”From Area 5- , Hiram locked up the third seed in the region and will visit Lanier on Thursday.“From what I’ve seen Lanier plays well,” Thomas said. “They play sound volleyball. On defense, they are where they need to be.”Lanier has a 29-21 record and lost to Gainesville in the Area 8- championship game 3-1. The Lady Longhorns are led in kills by Jessica Helmink, who has 323 in 112 sets. Angela Raez, Clair McGranahan and Aja Bauer are other big-time contributors on offense with Jordan Hyndshaw and Raez handling most of the setting.“I’m just trying to convince the girls to have no regrets and play their hardest,” Thomas said. “Have good energy and be focused. Leave it all on the court.”Last season, the Lady Hornets made it to the first round as well but were eliminated by Starr’s Mill.“I think our girls are ready,” Thomas said. “Last year, we made it to the state tournament but we were unable to get out of the first round. One of our goals is to make it to the state tournament but take it a step further this year. Hopefully, that motivation can help them play well and hard.”If the Lady Hornets advance, they will meet the winner of the Starr’s Mill and Dunwoody matchup.In softball, Paulding County was the only team to make the tournament. The Lady Patriots’ series against Heritage in Conyers begins today.
