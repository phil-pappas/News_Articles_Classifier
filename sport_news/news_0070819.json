In order to be successful this weekend, we will need to be extremely patient and tough in our mindset. Additionally, we will need our entire lineup to step up this week in this very strong field.”HISTORY AT THE LANDFALL TRADITIONThe Gamecocks have competed at The Landfall Tradition in each of the past five seasons and have claimed three top-five finishes at the event. Last year, Carolina finished in a tie for third with a score of 293-287-291=871 (+7). Nanna Madsen was the runner-up on the individual leaderboard after turning in a score of 66-72-72=210 (-6). Her first-round score of 66 tied the individual low-round record at the event. Juniors Katelyn Dambaugh (+5) and Jia Xin Yang (+6) helped pace the middle of the lineup and look to build off that experience from a year ago.LAST TIME OUTCarolina shot 299-310-295=904 (+40), finishing in 11th place out of 18 teams at the Ruth’s Chris Tar Heel Invitational. The wet conditions proved a challenge for all as no team finished under par at the event. Senior Sarah Schmelzel led the Gamecocks, shooting 72-76-75=223 (+7) to tie for 27th individually at the event. Freshman Gaby Amos was in the lineup for the first time and fired a 71 on Day Three, the best round of any Gamecock over the weekend. Junior Katelyn Dambaugh and sophomore Ainhoa Olarra each tied for 39th place individually with scores of 10-over.BREAKING DOWN THE FIELDThe Gamecocks have faced at least one top-10 team in each tournament this fall, and The Landfall Tradition will be no different with No. 5 Duke, No. 7 Alabama and No. 10 Oklahoma State in the field. South Carolina sits at No. 38 in the latest Golfweek rankings. Eight other teams at the event are currently ranked in the top 40, including Virginia (17), Purdue (18), NC State (26), Ohio State (30), Clemson (31), Notre Dame (32), Michigan State (34) and North Carolina (37). With Clemson in the field, this marks the first Palmetto Series matchup in women’s golf of 2015-16. In each event the two schools compete this season, the team that finishes higher on the leaderboard in more events will be awarded one point.RECORDS FALLINGJunior Katelyn Dambaugh matched her career-best 65 at the 2015 ANNIKA Invitational, once again tying the program’s low-18 record.

Senior Sarah Schmelzel (74.52) also sits in the top five on South Carolina’s career scoring average list.
