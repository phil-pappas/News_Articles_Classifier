Everyone else would've had a home run or a triple, and when he got to the base he laid down in mock exhaustion and it looked like he was going to sleep. Everybody was admiring his skill at this age and being hurt a little bit, to still be able to hit a ball the way he did as a kid and then the humor he put into it. I mean it was really funny the whole place was standing up to give him a standing ovation.” \nThis is only one example of the many memories that were made during the Old Bridge alumni baseball game at the Lombardi Complex. \nForty former athletes played, which included those who attended Madison Central and Cedar Ridge, the high schools that resided in Old Bridge township before they merged together to become Old Bridge High School. The event started at noon, with batting practice and warm ups and the game itself lasted from 1-4 p.m. and through nine innings. \n“(Head coach James) Freel thought it would be a nice thing to meet some of the players from the past and up until the present to reconnect with people in the community and the players,” Cole said. “Both myself and another assistant coach, Mike Anastasio, both were head coaches at Old Bridge in the past. We had a lot of ties to our old players and coach Freel wanted to meet as many people as he could and we thought a great way to do that was to have an alumni game, so we did.” \nPitching set the tone for the day. \n“We had some really good pitchers, guys that had been pro baseball and guys that had pitched in college and they made the game very good from the start because they both threw the ball very well,” Cole said. “So I think people played a little harder because of that.” \nThe event overall was an enriching way for more recent graduates to meet and compete with baseball players who had represented Old Bridge in the preceding decades. It brought them together, evoked their sense of pride and fostered an environment that created lasting memories. \n“The game was very successful in every way,” Cole said. “Everything we planned came out well and it was fun for the people who were there, the spectators and players and it was generally great enjoyment for everyone. We are very hopeful of doing it again, I think we'd like to try.” \nStaff Writer Alyssa Davis: adavis3@gannettnj.com 60 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LgRJQQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:57:38.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
