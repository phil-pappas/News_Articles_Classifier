In his 32 seasons, the Raiders have won 26 league, 16 county, 15 state sectional and four state group championships.\nMarchese said the biggest difference from now and when he started is, \"I spent half my time coaching and the other half explaining to parents why players were in this or that position. It was like being on trial every week.\"\nOver time, Marchese’s program thrived. He said the past 15 years have been the best, with the addition of close friend and volunteer assistant Mike Preziosi. \nStrauss said her coach is a great motivator and teacher and \"always makes it fun.\"\nMarchese said \"it’s been a great run,\" but figures it’s \"nearing its end.\"\nHe has children in Montana and Idaho and says when they start having kids, it might be time for he and wife, Linda, to relocate.\n\"I’ve been blessed, being in a school that supports tennis with such great kids,\" Marchese said.\nCOURAGE AWARD: Abby Schwartz failed to reach her third straight Passaic County tournament final, but displayed incredible courage nonetheless.\nThe Wayne Valley senior won a second doubles trophy two years ago and reached last year’s third singles final. But she lost to West Milford’s Tess Korinko in Thursday’s first-singles semis, 6-2, 6-0.\nSchwartz has been plagued by a severe case of turf toe since the start of the season, but refused to lay down her racket despite suffering extreme pain throughout the match.\n\"My foot was throbbing every time I took a step,\" Schwartz said. \"But I tried not to let it get the best of me. I wasn’t going to let that be the reason I lost.\"\nSchwartz credited Korinko for that, calling her a \"terrific competitor.\"\n\"She played a terrific match,\" Schwartz said. \"No matter where I hit it, she was able to get to it. I’m really proud of how I did, though.\"\nROLLER COASTER RIDE: Through two rounds of this year’s state team tournament, the Immaculate Heart second doubles pair of senior twins Nika and Nila Nejad might have played the most compelling match.\nIn Tuesday’s Non-Public, North A quarterfinal against Kent Place, the teams were tied, 2-2, and it came down to the Nejads’ match against rivals Renee Safran and Kelcie Engles.\nThe Nejads won the first set, but lost the second, 1-6. They went ahead, 5-2, in the third set before their opponents rallied to take a 6-5 lead. The Nejads trailed, 40-0, in the next game, but survived three match points, won the game and took the ensuing tiebreaker, 9-7.\n\"They really gutted that one out,\" Blue Eagles coach Steven Park said of his Bergen County tournament large-school runner-ups. \"I’m really happy … not just for the win but for them.\"\n\"It was an intense match and very stressful,\" said Nika Nejad, whose team lost to top-seeded Oak Knoll on Thursday in the sectional semifinals. \"Fortunately, we were able to stay positive.\"\nONCE A RAIDER…: First-year Cliffside Park coach John Janucci starred for the school before graduating in 2000. Now he’s determined to build a winning tradition at his alma mater and \"give something back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:37.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
