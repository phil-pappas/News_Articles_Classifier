From the Dodgers’ side, Tejada’s injury was seen as the unfortunate consequence of hard-nosed play – the neighborhood play in a very rough neighborhood, if you will. Utley even reportedly reached out to Tejada through Mets third baseman David Wright Saturday night to offer an apology, saying he felt “terrible” about the injury.\nMLB’s chief baseball officer Joe Torre came down firmly on one side of the argument Sunday night, suspending the Dodgers infielder for Games 3 and 4 of the NLDS for what he called an “illegal slide.”\nTorre was in attendance at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night to see the play first hand and afterward expressed his concern that Utley had gone “over the top” in his attempt to break up a critical double play in the seventh inning of Game 2. Torre did offer support for the umpiring crew, second-base umpire Chris Guccione in particular, after the game. But Sunday’s ruling would seem to clearly indicate Utley should have been ruled out, giving the Mets a double play that would have ended the inning with the Mets’ 2-1 lead intact. The Dodgers went on to score four runs after a replay review ruled Tejada had failed to touch second base.\n“As I said after the game, the determination of whether a baserunner has intentionally interfered with a player attempting to turn a double play is left to the judgment of the umpire on the field and that judgment call is not subject to review,” Torre said in a statement announcing the suspension. “I should add that determining where to draw the line between an illegal slide and a legitimate hard play is an extremely difficult call for our umpires.\n“However, after thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley’s action warrants discipline. While I sincerely believe that Mr. Utley had no intention of injuring Ruben Tejada and was attempting to help his club in a critical situation, I believe his slide was in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a)(13) which is designed to protect fielders from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.”\nTorre’s statement was quickly followed by one from Utley’s agent, Joel Wolfe, saying Utley would appeal the suspension “immediately.” MLB is expected to expedite the hearing of that appeal so that the matter is settled before Game 3 of the Dodgers-Mets series Monday night.\n“A two-game suspension for a legal baseball play is outrageous and completely unacceptable,” Wolfe said. “Chase did what all players are taught to do in this situation – break up the double play. We routinely see plays at second base similar to this one that have not resulted in suspensions. Chase feels terrible about Ruben Tejada’s injury and everyone who knows him knows that he would never intentionally hurt anybody.”\nTwitter was filled with screen grabs and gifs Sunday proving Wolfe’s point. Similar plays (some involving Mets players delivering the takeout slides) including one that ended Pirates shortstop Jung Ho Kang’s season in mid-September did not draw suspensions.\n“I look at it as a baseball play,” Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said Sunday afternoon before the suspension was announced. “It was a hard, aggressive, legal slide to me.\n“Our organization is proud of the way Chase plays. We love the way he plays. He’s got a reputation for playing the game right, playing it hard and we’re behind him 100 percent.”\nAt the time, Mattingly said it was “definitely a possibility” that Utley would be in the starting lineup for Game 3 despite the possibility of retaliation by the Mets. Utley is 6 for 18 with a double and a home run off the Mets’ Game 3 starter, Matt Harvey.\nThe Mets released a statement Sunday night saying they support the suspension and “feel this was the appropriate course of action. With this decision behind us, the team and our fans can now focus on playing winning baseball.”\nMattingly called Tejada “courageous” for standing in against Utley. But he pointed a finger at the New York media and claimed a double standard in the way Utley is being vilified.\n“Their captain, David Wright, (if he) comes into (Dodgers rookie shortstop Corey) Seager and slides like that – the exact same slide – and let’s say he didn’t get hurt, there would be rumblings but it goes away,” Mattingly said. “It would have just been a hard slide.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:25:09.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
