But we're all in it together. No-one is the villain,\" Sherwood told reporters. \n\"I am sure Brad Guzan has the confidence to put it right.\" \nHowever, Sherwood did suggest that he will not be afraid to make a change. \n\"Goalkeepers can only play one position. Mark Bunn will be considered. When it's right to make the change, I will make it.\" \nSherwood remains upbeat despite his side's dire start to the campaign and said he has had no conversations with either owner Randy Lerner or chief executive Tom Fox about his future. \n\"I didn't speak much to them when we were doing well last season. That's not unusual,\" he said. \n\"It's obviously a transition period. I am proud to be Aston Villa manager. \n\"I will give everything to the cause. I can't give any more than I am giving, We will get through it. \n\"We will need Villa Park bouncing tomorrow. We need the help of the fans.\" \n(Reporting by Martyn Herman.
