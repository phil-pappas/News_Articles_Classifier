The momentum turned slightly in favor of the Indians, who rode that into the overtime period before advancing to their first region championship on PKs. \n\"(Henry Clay's) so quick and so talented, to get into overtime was huge for us,\" Madison Central Coach Chris Dunham said. \"And then to win in PKs? You just never know what's going to happen.\" \nHenry Clay Coach Mebit Aragaw was proud of the effort his girls displayed, especially his seniors'. \n\"We had our chances,\" Aragaw said. \"We played great. ... We made one mistake and it cost us.\" \nCatholic advances \nAlana Hughes was a freshman when Lexington Catholic last reached the 11th Region championship in 2012. \nHer two goals led the Knights to a 2-0 win over Woodford County in the first 11th Region semifinal Tuesday night at Madison Southern. \nEventual state champion Tates Creek ended LexCath's season in 2012. Hughes played a bit in that defeat. \"It's exciting going back,\" she said. \nWhile the Knights controlled possession for the bulk of the first half, they had difficulty getting clean shots against a Woodford defense content playing its midfielders deep. \n\"We knew they were going to come out really hard, so we had to mentally prepare for that,\" said Lexington Catholic senior Rachel Yeager. \nCatholic had seven first-half shots, three off set pieces — including a free kick by Hughes that sailed in over Woodford keeper Addie Martin. \nHitting the free kick \"really pushed our momentum forward,\" Hughes said. She has a frustrating relationship with those sets. \n\"Each free kick, I either hit it or miss it by a lot,\" she said, laughing. \nKasey Neuer, a junior, said the Knights were motivated by their seniors and coaches to be stronger in the midfield after the break. She said the Knights had a time against Woodford's middle line in their previous meeting, a 2-1 Catholic win. \nThe Knights again owned the ball in the second period, managing double-digit shot attempts in the half. That included a lay-in goal by Hughes that followed Martin's stop of a long shot attempt by Austin Wahle. \nHughes \"was hoping for\" a hat trick. Her final shot met metal in the 80th minute. She was more than satisfied coming away with the victory. \nWoodford County had won seven of its last eight games. It allowed just 10 goals entering Tuesday, leading the region in that category. \nCatholic meets Madison Central in the finals. Before the second semifinal began, Hughes said her team was ready for either team that it would face. \n\"We're ready to keep going, pushing and not stopping,\" Hughes said. \nLEXINGTON CATHOLIC 2, WOODFORD CO. 0 \n11th Region semifinals at Madison Southern \nG— LC: Hughes 2 (FK 37', 59'). \nGK— LC: Williams.
