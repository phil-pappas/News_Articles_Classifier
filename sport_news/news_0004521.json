He was due to meet with law enforcement officials, drug counselors and advocates at a community center to show \"a sense of urgency that we at the federal level can do more to address this issue,\" Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, told reporters.\nWest Virginia has the highest rate of overdose deaths in the U.S. — more than twice the national average, according to a report by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\nState officials say the problem is damaging the economy, depressing the workforce and overwhelming social services.\nOfficials stressed the problem is a national one. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released in July found the number of people who reported using heroin within the past year had nearly doubled from 2002 to 2013. Heroin use was up among nearly all demographic groups, but showed particular spikes among women and non-Latino whites.\nResearchers say two factors are driving the trend: the rise in abuse of opioid painkillers — drugs that are often a precursor to heroin — and the increasing availability of cheap heroin.\nResearchers found that most users reported using at least one other drug in combination with heroin, a factor that contributes to high overdose rates. Between 2002 and 2013, the rate of heroin-related overdose deaths nearly quadrupled, and more than 8,200 people — by some estimates, one in every 50 addicts — died in 2013, according to the CDC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:37:00.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
