We're proud of having obtained that.\" \nTorres, a midfielder with Major League Soccer's Houston Dynamo, put El Tri ahead in the sixth minute when he outjumped Jeremy Gagnon-Lapare just outside the 6-yard box and scored on a header. \nHirving Lozano scored on a right-footed shot from just outside the penalty area in the 57th minute to seal the deal. \n\"It's surprising that Canada played such a defensive game,\" Gutierrez said. \"We really expected more than that and that part made it easier to reach our objective. It was a complicated game because it was hard to play against a team where all their players are up in the midfield.\" \n-Routledge said. \"Some days they go in, some days they don't. The fact we're getting in those spots and getting those chances is a sign of good things to come.\" \nMexico and Honduras will meet in the rather meaningless final of the North and Central American and Caribbean region \nHonduras earned CONCACAF's other automatic berth with a 2-0 win over the United States. \nCanada will play the U.S. in the third-place game Tuesday, and the winner meets Colombia at Rio from March 21-29 for another Olympic slot. \nCopyright © The Associated Press.
