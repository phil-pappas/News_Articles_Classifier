Having a number of seniors on the field doesn’t guarantee any success,” said APSU football coach Kirby Cannon. “We had a good number in 2013; we had a good number last year. We don’t have a good number of seniors on the field this year.” \nAt any given time, APSU will have five freshman on the field in their offensive line “and people moan and groan if they have one,” said Cannon. \n“We aren’t just young. … We are embryotic.” \nAnd that prenatal state the Governors find themselves in has been causing woes during the second quarters of games recently. In just the past four games, Austin Peay has gone 48-0 in the last four minutes of the second quarter. Murray crushes APSU’s hopes of repeating victory \n“This team is a very emotionally driven team, and what I mean by that is the defense gets a stop then the offense feels like we can do it. If the offense scores, then the defense comes out better than they were before. I feel like that’s a lack of maturity,” sophomore wide receiver Jared Beard said. \n“We’ve got to learn how to win. We really have to learn how to win because regardless of if the offense does good or bad, the defense does good or bad, both sides have to come out with the exact same motivation as if the opposite were doing good.” \nThe number of young players and the lack of wins play roles in Beard’s mind on the lack of mental maturity on the field. \n“I think players don’t even know how that feels, so when they get in those situations, it’s like they can’t shake it,” said Beard, who caught a big-momentum touchdown in the loss to Murray State last week. \n“You can’t be like that in football.” \nBeard’s assessment is one that Cannon shares. \n“You have all this youth, but you don’t have any production from your older classes,” he said. “We have a few juniors that are out there and ready to play, but for the most part we are missing that leadership, that ability to say, 'hey, we’ve been here before.’ … None of our guys have that type of experience.” \nA few flashes of offensive brilliance and true shows of units working cohesively indicate that things are looking up for the program, but the rise is a slow and often frustrating one. \nAustin Peay has yet to win a game this season and is currently on an 11-game losing streak dating back to last season. \n“I’m not going to drop a bunch of guys. I’m not going to turn around and recruit a bunch of junior college or transfer guys that have no business being at Austin Peay. That was the plan from day one, build it right, and it means you are building it slow.” \nA ground-up makeover of APSU football has brought in the likes of Beard and likely future top OVC running back Kendall Morris. However, it does nothing to change the fact that the sophomore- and freshman-heavy starting roster hasn’t found an answer to the youth problem. \n“There comes a day when you throw that to the side. You don’t talk about it anymore,\" Cannons said. \"You don’t use it in any way as an excuse. But up until you play, up until you find out what it takes it’s a huge negative for our team.” \nReach Autumn Allison at aallison@theleafchronicle.com or (931) 245-0248.
