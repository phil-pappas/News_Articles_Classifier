Joerger has said that he intends to use at least a 10-man rotation, so Brandan Wright's absence Wednesday to nurse a sore knee is worth noting.\nWhat the rotation will look like may still be a bit unclear. What is clear is that Joerger will utilize all options in terms of lineup combinations.\nHe'll play small ball and employ a bigger-than-normal lineup at times. Joerger spent most of the preseason experimenting with different lineup combinations and made use of an expansive wing rotation Wednesday in what turned out to be a game with regular-season intensity.\n\"The guys brought it. Not that they haven't yet, but maybe with not that sense of urgency,\" Joerger said. \"There were some fumbles in there (early), and the timing was off. I'm glad we got it out of our system.\"\nHere are a few other observations from the preseason:\nJury is still out on Jeff Green starting: A contrast in Jeff Green's play at small forward with the starters and the second unit was on display Wednesday as much as the Grizzlies' overall versatility. That has been the case throughout the exhibition schedule given Green again started the game against Atlanta and didn't make an impact in the first half.\nHe went 0 for 2 from the field with zero points and one rebound. Meanwhile, Tony Allen had seven points, three rebounds and four fouls in the first half.\nGreen came off the bench in the second half and flourished. He appeared more comfortable with the ball in his hands and the ability to create his own shot. Green scored 10 points on 5-of-7 shooting in 12 minutes and picked up four rebounds. He was particularly good when playing alongside Matt Barnes on the wing. Green exploited his matchup against a smaller shooting guard, Tim Hardaway Jr.\nCourtney Lee is loaded for bear: Lee is the only Griz player to score in double figures in every game during the preseason. Lee is shooting 50 percent overall and 52.6 percent from 3-point range, and showing an aggressiveness on offense as promised.\nThe Big Three are easing into the season: Mike Conley, Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol have largely looked uninspired in limited minutes. Randolph and Gasol started 1 of 7 from the field against Atlanta, and Conley made just one shot. That's the bad news. The good news is that Conley made a clutch 3-pointer that proved to be the game-winner against Atlanta. Gasol and Randolph have each shown their wares at different times. Randolph's double-double (19 points and 13 rebounds) in the Atlanta game to go with his strong offensive outing against Cleveland on Oct. 12 proved that his skills remain reliable. Gasol didn't play with his national team in Spain during the off-season for the first time in a decade and clearly used the preseason to get into shape and develop timing.\nMatt Barnes' misfires aren't a concern: The Grizzlies traded for Barnes mostly for his defensive intensity, but he'll be counted on to make shots. So far, Barnes has been only half good on the investment. But Joerger isn't alarmed by Barnes' inability to make 3-point shots during the preseason.\n\"I think he was 1 for 24 from three in the preseason last year. I was giving him grief about it,\" Joerger said. \"So far this year he's made (two). But he's played good minutes. The other night he was plus-32, so he's having an impact on the game.\"\nBarnes is 2 for 23 from 3-point range in five preseason appearances.\nOdds and ends: Backup shooting guard Jordan Adams could see his first preseason action Friday night against Orlando after recovering from knee surgery. Third-string point guard Russ Smith is likely to log a lot of minutes in the preseason finale. Veteran journeyman center Ryan Hollins is expected to build upon his chances of making the Grizzlies' 15-man regular-season roster. The Grizzlies have a few loose ends to tie up before the regular season begins, but none of those issues will have a direct bearing on the start of the season.\nAdams' absence during the exhibition schedule effectively took him out of the mix at least for the first third of the regular-season schedule. Smith saw meaningful time but didn't convince teammates nor coaches that he is yet capable to run the Griz offense effectively. Hollins, the only true center available to back up Gasol, continues to make a case for a roster spot, so his presence remains a conundrum for Griz management.\nTip-in: The Grizzlies announced their plans for Oct. 28 when they host the Cleveland Cavaliers for the regular-season opener in FedExForum.\nFans are encouraged to arrive early for a Party on the Plaza from 5-7 p.m. with live music from Motel Mirrors, DJ Witnesse and Memphis' own Al Kapone. The opening-night festivities also will include the return of legendary NBA entertainer \"The Red Panda Acrobat.\" Panda will make her triumphant return to the league for a halftime performance, ending her retirement after 20-plus seasons.\nBefore the season opener, Griz center Marc Gasol will host select MVP season-ticket holders at the Mid-South Corn Maze that bears his likeness on Sunday at 4 p.m. Gasol's event is a prelude to the Grizzlies' tip-off luncheon on Monday at 11:45 a.m. with limited tickets still available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:35:07.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
