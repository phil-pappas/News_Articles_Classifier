The right hand side of the car suffered the damage -- front and rear suspension right hand side, the nose, the rear wing, crash structure.\n\"We haven't seen anything, however, that should stop us getting the car back together (for Austin),\" added Chester, whose team have been struggling for cash but are hoping to be taken over by Renault.\nDeputy principal Federico Gastaldi said there was a mood of optimism for the future.\n\"There’s an underlying confidence and strengthening resolve at Enstone (the factory) as we have a positive outlook for the future, all of which will become evident before too long,\" added the Argentine.\n\"There’s no point dancing faster than the music, but our dancing shoes are being polished in readiness.\"\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin , editing by Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:34:34.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
