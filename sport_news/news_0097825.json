The 2014 lawsuit was one of several such claims against NFL teams. \nThose covered cheered in the 2011-13 seasons and could receive at least $2,500 each, per season. \nCourt documents state that the Bengals added to cheerleader compensation starting with the 2014 season and that the Bengals deny wrongdoing but decided to settle the lawsuit to avoid lengthy, expensive litigation. \nThe settlement is subject to a Dec. 3 fairness hearing. The team declined to comment Wednesday.
