The way to characterise policies of the government is -- Congress plus a cow. Policies are the same,\" Shourie said at book launch function.\nThe function to launch 'Turn of The Tortoise', a book written by former Business Standard Editor-in-Chief T N Ninan, was attended by Manmohan Singh, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subranamian and former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran. Pointing out differences between the present and the previous governments, Shourie said \"there is clearer belief (in the present dispensation) that managing economy means managing the headlines and this is not really going to work.\" Targeting Modi, the minister in the Vajpayee government said, \"I feel there was never a weaker a PMO as now\". (Read: Why the Modi government needs to take Arun Shourie's criticism seriously )\nHe said \"there has never been as great a centralisation of functions, not power, of functions in PMO as now. ...If fellows don't dont have domain expertise, that Brajesh Mishra had, L K Jha had, all these principal secretaries had, then things get stuck.\"Shourie said, \"everybody is busy and everybody is doing very hard work, but it is not resulting in two there big things that was problem at that time(UPA government time).\" Elaborating, he said, \"If you see impediments that were there in tax administration, virtually no change... Banking reform has been delayed by year and a half for no reason. So therefore this tortoise is very generous metaphor. Ye to so hi jata hai (this tortoise goes to sleep).\"\nHe claimed that industrialists are afraid of speaking against the government. \"The industrialists who meet the Prime Minister don't speak whole truth. After meeting PM, they wonder what is happening and say 'please do something'. And in front of media they give the government 9 out of 10,\" Shourie claimed. Shourie noted that Parliament has become alibi for not doing anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:02:04.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
