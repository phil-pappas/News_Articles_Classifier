Drivers face the same penalty even if they are not smoking.\nThe law applies even if vehicle windows or a sunroof are open. It does not apply to a convertible if the top is down and properly stowed - and use of electronic cigarettes is not affected by the legislation.\nThe ban has not been introduced in Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:13:33.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
