It was the first meeting between the rivals since the \"Deflategate\" storm erupted after the AFC title game in January. \nFor a half, the teams traded jabs. \nBut New England seized control in the second half. \nBrady's 25-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowksi gave New England a 27-21 lead. And when the Patriots stopped the Colts (3-3) on an odd-looking and ill-advised fake punt, the scrambling Brady eventually found LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard scoring pass that made it 34-21. \nAndrew Luck was 30 of 50 for 312 yards and three touchdowns in his first game back from an injured right shoulder. \nOnline: \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:18:53.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
