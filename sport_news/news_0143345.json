Leukemia. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBrandon Novack, now 25, was 12 when his neck swelled up — a symptom doctors initially thought was mono, but was something much worse. \n“Initially, they thought I had mono, so they gave me antibiotics for that,” Novack, a Belgium, Wisconsin, native, said. “Then, I had an allergic reaction to the antibiotics. When I had that, they gave me tests and eventually figured out it was leukemia.” \nNovack spent the next 108 weeks in treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia, which included chemotherapy and radiation. \n“Initially, when you hear that, it’s a shock. It was a shock to my whole family,” he said. “But I had the attitude that I was going to beat it.” \nNovack said the hardest part was seeing his parents feeling helpless during the treatment, but said their support, and the support of his brother, family and community, gave him hope. \n“Everyone was amazing with the support,” he said. \nLooking out the window from his room at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, it also gave him hope seeing the lights on all night at the medical college, where research funded by the MACC Fund (Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer, Inc.) was underway. The MACC Fund is dedicated to funding childhood cancer and related blood disorder research. \n“The thing that benefited me the most is the hope and feeling that there are people out there working around the clock (on research),” he said. “The research is all done here, but the stuff they find can ultimately help a kid in New York or a kid in California.” \nNovack was in seventh grade when he was diagnosed, but missed much of the school year because of treatment. He was able to spend more time in school during eighth grade, but experienced complications when treatments weakened his bones, resulting in a fractured back and fractured bones in his feet. \n“I just wanted to be a kid like everyone else, but obviously there was limitations,” he said. \nNovack spent his first two years of college attending the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan, but transferred to Green Bay to finish a business degree. During his freshman year, he had another setback when he experienced double vision, which led to doctors to find bleeding near his brain stem. \n“They noticed there had been bleeding around my brain stem. It wasn’t active, but they noticed it had been at some point,” he said. \nNow an adult, Novack still returns to the children's hospital once a year for a check-up. \nNovack is a business analyst at Acuity Insurance, coaches football at Sheboygan North High School and volunteers in public relations for the Milwaukee Bucks.
