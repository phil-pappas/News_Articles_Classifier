Their defense was struggling to make the big play.\nAgain.\nAnd their high-powered offense couldn’t deliver the knockout punch.\nAgain.\nBut there was Dwayne Harris, with just a little over seven minutes to play, and his Giants in trouble against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday afternoon at MetLife Stadium. And there was the kickoff, right at the goal line. And then Harris found a crease and exploded up the field, gone for a 100-yard kickoff return, the decisive score in a 27-20 victory that the Giants desperately needed. With the win, Tom Coughlin joined Steve Owen as the only coaches in franchise history to reach 100 regular-season wins.\nINSTANT ANALYSIS: GIANTS 27, COWBOYS 20\nIt wasn’t pretty and it certainly wasn’t perfect, but the Giants (4-3) remained atop the NFC East. They still can’t truly put away an opponent, and somehow, they barely survived against a Cowboys team that was down Dez Bryant and started journeyman Matt Cassel at quarterback. For a second straight week, Eli Manning and the offense struggled and Odell Beckham Jr. (four catches, 35 yards) was nearly invisible\nBut they didn’t repeat their season-opening debacle in Dallas, either. Behind three interceptions from the ‘D’ and Harris’ dramatic TD, the Giants escaped with a victory. With 1:27 to play, and the Cowboys set to get the ball one final time, gunner Myles White finished off Dallas when Cole Beasley muffed a punt straight through his hands and White recovered.\nNot that this was supposed to be a game for even that long, not after the Giants defnse started the second half out with such a bang.\n HERE.\nJust six plays into the third quarter, Dallas seemed to be marching again, facing second-and-9 from midfield, when Cassel fired an out pass to Terrance Williams. But Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie exploded to the ball well ahead of Williams, picking off the pass and dashing back to the end zone for a 17-13 lead with 11:19 left in the third quarter.\nCassel tried to get Dallas back into things a possession later, driving them to the Giants 41, and on second-and-8, he had Williams running free toward the left corner of the end zone. But Cassel heaved a wobbly duck for Williams, and the pass was easily intercepted by Brandon Meriweather at the 1.\nKen Goldfield/Ken Goldfield Eli Manning throws for just 170 yards. Manning knew what to do. Thanks to a terrific one-handed grab from Rueben Randle at midfield, he worked the Giants out of the back of their own end zone, then handed to Shane Vereen, who rumbled 39 yards to the 11, setting up a 34-yard Brown field goal that extended the lead to 20-13 with 3:18 left in the third quarter.\nBut Dallas wouldn’t go away. With 7:14 to play, Cassel had capped a stunning nine-play, 80-yard drive by rolling right on first-and-10 from the Giants 25, and, with plenty of time, firing a strike to Devin Street in the corner of the end zone. The score tied the game, 20-20, conjuring images of the Giants’ season-opening nightmare in Dallas, only for Harris, the ex-Cowboy, to save the day.\nAll of this came after a first half in which the Cowboys had asserted themselves. They established the run game early. After the Giants’ opening drive stalled, Cassel took the ball at his 20, opened with a 12-yard completion to Jason Witten, the proceeded to hand off on six of the next nine plays as Dallas roared to the Giants 12. With 5:29 left, Dan Bailey gave Dallas the early 3-0 lead with a 30-yard field goal.\nBut after two fruitless drives, the Giants offense finally awakened early in the second quarter, behind an unlikely spark. It was little-used running back Orleans Darkwa - not Rashad Jennings or Andre Williams or Shane Vereen - who would rack up 41 rushing yards on an eight-play, 79-yard TD drive.\nDarkwa ran with a power and aggression that had been missing in the Giants ground game all season, capping the drive by dragging three Cowboys into the end zone on a 15-yard touchdown run that gave Big Blue a 7-0 lead with 11:02 left in the half.\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID & iOS\nKen Goldfield/Ken Goldfield Orleans Darkwa carries eight times for 48 yards and a touchdown.\nThe Cowboys seemed to have an answer on their ensuing drive, after Josh Brown’s kickoff traveled out of bounds, giving Dallas the ball at their 40. Four plays in, on second-and-10 from their own 31, Cassel fired a short pass that just barely stuck to Darren McFadden’s fingertips, and the running back deked past a handful of sloppy Giants tackles and raced to the end zone.\nBut the play was called back after a phantom offensive pass interference penalty on Cowboys receiver Devin Street, and the Cowboys eventually had to settle for a 45-yard field goal from Bailey to tighten things to 7-6.\nDallas wasn’t done. Following a Giants three-and-out, Cassel led the Cowboys on a 72-yard drive touchdown drive that got plenty of help from Big Blue. Three penalties - including back-to-back defensive holding calls early on - helped get Dallas to the Giants 2, setting up a TD dive by McFadden for a 13-7 edge with 2:22 to play.\nManning responded by leading an eight-play, 51-yard drive that culminated in a 47-yard Josh Brown field goal that closed things to 13-10 before halftime.\nRelated Stories Instant analysis: Giants defeat Cowboys, 27-20 Patriots too much for Jets, win AFC East showdown 30-23 Video: Giants support LGBT athletes via You Can Play project Texans' Arian Foster likely out for rest of season Tags: dallas cowboys , dwayne harris , matt cassel , dominique rodgers-cromartie , eli manning , rueben randle , shane vereen , orleans darkwa", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://nydn.us/app"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:12:50.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
