(Photo: Christian Petersen/USA TODAY Images) Story Highlights Schenn beat out Gudas for season opener spot Trying to quickly get familiar with defensive parter Medvedev CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTAMPA Flyers defenseman Luke Schenn has been quickly trying to brush up on his Russian. \nFor most of the week, Schenn practiced as the seventh defenseman. The day before the season opener, he learned that he’d be in the lineup with a new defensive partner in 33-year-old newcomer to America Evgeny Medvedev. \n“I’ve had maybe not even half a practice with him,” Schenn said before Thursday’s opener against the Tampa Bay Lightning. “We’re going to obviously try to read off each other a little bit, but we’ve had the whiteboard out a little bit.” \nMedvedev is trying to learn English quickly. He’s not bad, but predicts he needs another month before he won’t need a translator’s help. When he and Schenn aren’t on the same page they hand off Medvedev’s cell phone, which has a translating app that allows Schenn to type in English, Medvedev to read in Russian and vice versa. \n“We’ll figure it out quickly,” Schenn said. “We have no choice.” \nSchenn was confident the communication would work out the same way he was confident in his play since training camp opened. \nAt times, it was clear that he was on the outside looking in with him and now-demoted Andrew MacDonald working as a pair and getting the last turn in reps of drills. \n“I felt good,” Schenn said. “There’s a lot of outside noise and a lot of numbers with the cap. Obviously you start at the bottom and work your way up. I’ve been in that situation before. You start paying attention to numbers and what people are saying around you and there will be a lot of distractions and it gets you unfocused. I actually wasn’t real worried the whole time because I felt good about things.” \nSchenn was drafted fifth overall in 2008 by Toronto. The outside noise in Philadelphia is merely a whisper compared to north of the border. Even after being healthy scratched 11 games last year, he came into camp thinking that a top-six job was his. \n“There’s a lot of outside noise there,” Schenn said rumors in Toronto. “I’ve been in the situation before, too. I’ve been in and out of the lineup here. You just learn from past experiences.” \nTrying not to pay attention to what was being said around him helped Schenn get on the opening night roster. He beat out former Lightning defenseman Radko Gudas, who was a healthy scratch against his former team. Schenn had impressed new coach Dave Hakstol for a while. \n“He’s the guy that he’s been rock solid from the start of camp,” Hakstol said. “He’s done a good job and he’s competed hard. He’ll be the guy who’s in that spot. I think it’s a good pair with what the two guys bring. It’s a good combination.” System becoming second nature \nWith a new coach, the Flyers are learning a new system. After a training camp that lasted only 19 days, they were expected to make Hakstol’s vision become their first instinct on the ice. \n“I think we’re getting there in the larger sense. I think we’re getting there,” Hakstol said. “It’s still gonna take time to play at top speed without having to think within the systems, but everything’s pretty simple. They’ve done a good job of handling them.” \nThrough seven preseason games, a bunch of practices and a lot of work in the classroom, the Flyers are getting to the point where they’re acting on the ice instead of thinking first. That fraction of a second is critical in hockey. \n“Everyone has it in their head. It’s fresh,” alternate captain Wayne Simmonds said. “We know what we have to do. To a man, I think we’re pretty much there.” Loose pucks \nVinny Lecavalier, Sam Gagner and Gudas were all healthy scratches. The three have a combined salary cap hit of approximately $8.7 million. … For the second time in as many years, the Flyers opened their season on the road. … Before Thursday, they had lost three straight opening nights. \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com .
