To be admired, even envied, for the foresight that's paid off so handsomely. To feel the cool comfort of knowing I'm stronger, smarter, more ethical and even better looking than lesser, poorer individuals.\nYes, I possess two tickets for terrace seats at Wrigley Field for the National League Championship Series and — not to jinx it — the World Series.\nEven more sweet is that it was my daughter Rebecca who did the work. She's the one who got on the waiting list in 2005 and who walked through Wrigley on a cold winter day in early 2014, sending me photos of views from the seats that were available, finally selecting the perfect seats — directly up from the catcher's spot in the bullpen and just under the overhang. She's the one who bit the bullet and bought the pair she could barely afford. (Note to parents: Learn the lesson every Cubs fan already knows — there's always hope.)\nEvery conversation about the Cubs playoff series against the Cardinals inevitably included: \"Did you see Baez's homer? Hammel's single? Rizzo's homer? Soler's laser to cut down Cruz at the plate? Schwarber's moonshot?\"\n\"Yes, I was there.\"\nSilence.\nMore silence.\nEven more silence as shock, wonder and jealousy bubbled just below the surface and I saw the imaginary dollar signs dancing about in my listener's head. No one asked if I have tickets to other games. That would have been as inconceivable as assuming I could take a private jet to Basel for dinner and a drink.\nI'm in a rarefied atmosphere where I can barely breathe (though perhaps I'm just choking at the prices I could get for these tickets).\nLast-minute Cubs tickets? How to navigate standing room only Rachel Crosby Can't stand to miss the Cubs during their final homestand this week? You may have to — literally.\nStanding-room-only tickets could be your best chance, because as the regular season comes to a close, seated tickets are going quick.

You may have to — literally.\nStanding-room-only tickets could be your best chance, because as the regular season comes to a close, seated tickets are going quick. Just before Friday's early afternoon Cubs-Cardinals matchup, standing-room...\n(Rachel Crosby) When it came time to renew the tickets, Rebecca and I reviewed 2014 and the Cubs' 73 wins. What kind of return could we expect in 2015? What money manager would recommend doubling down after that performance?\n\"Buy low, sell high,\" Rebecca reminded me, just before her lament about student loans and this year's costs for her startup business. The other half of this partnership would have to pay for the Cubs tickets this year. Guess who. (Note to parents: It never ends. Get used to it.)\nI spent — or as I prefer to think, invested — several thousand dollars. We could sell them along the way. April? Too cold. May? Everyone's in school. June? The Cubs don't look that good. July? Everyone's on vacation. In August, we got face value plus 5 percent and in September face plus 20 percent — just enough that my investment paid 15 cents on the dollar.\nWhen the Cubs offered a full set of postseason tickets, I was tapped out. I couldn't throw away any more money buying tickets for a bunch of games that may not happen. Rebecca pointed out that the money for unplayed games would roll over toward next year's tickets.\nPhotos of Cubs practice on Monday at Wrigley Field ahead of Tuesday's Game 3 against the Mets.\n\"Besides,\" she said, \"they're going to keep winning.\"\nOf course! Less risk plus more reward. My kind of bet.\nMaybe I could finally pay off the credit cards and the car loan and get the 40-year-old bathroom decor updated.\nThe high/low for the National League Division Series tickets in my section was $1,200/$600 per ticket. Working through all the scenarios, I realized there was no downside to attending the first game and selling the second. If they won the second, we'd move onto the NLCS, where we'd see them again in the home games. If they lost, we wouldn't be there to endure the torture of having our hearts broken yet again. Rebecca, despite her rational bent and analytical mind — she's a physicist by training — couldn't have disagreed more strongly.\nWe saw Baez's homer, Hammel's single, Rizzo's homer and Soler's laser to cut down Cruz at the plate. And Schwarber's moonshot. In person.\nThe Cubs are in the playoffs, with the players, the manager and the attitude to win it all. Yeah, even after those two games in New York.\nThey could win a pennant for the first time since my father was my daughter's age.\nThey could win a world championship for the first time since, well, a decade before my father was born.\nIn \"Field of Dreams,\" Timothy Busfield, playing Kevin Costner's pragmatic brother-in-law, suggests, implores and then demands that Costner sell the property and his baseball field to the bankers. When he finally sees the players and the light, he mumbles, \"Don't sell the farm, Ray.\"\nNot going to sell the tickets.\nBob Zeni is a writer, designer and die-hard Cubs fan.\n Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs National League Championship Series World Series Wrigley Field Kevin Costner Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56254b95/turbine/ct-cubs-practice-at-wrigley-field-on-monday-20151019", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56255432/turbine/ct-cubs-tickets-wrigley-nlds-nlcs-perspec-1020-20151019", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56018277/turbine/ct-cubs-standing-room-only-met-20150922"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:30:47.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
