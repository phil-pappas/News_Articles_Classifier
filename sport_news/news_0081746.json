He also cleared away some debris on the path to the playoffs, at least for his own team. Yes, the calendar has turned to October, which means the playoff pictures in New Hampshire and Maine are coming into focus. Exeter’s win gave it the separation it needs to likely rule the East Conference in Division I again, but other local squads face thornier roads to the postseason. Here’s a ranking of which local teams are in the best shape to not just make the playoffs, but secure the best possible seed. 1. St. Thomas (4-0 in Division II). Who’s going to be the first team to give the Saints a game? Laconia on Saturday? Trinity on the night before Halloween? Souhegan or Windham in the Division II championship? Behind quarterback Stephen Hedberg and his talented supporting cast, St. Thomas is scoring at a 48-points-per-game clip and has not run into a defense that’s slowed it. It should have plenty of motivation Saturday, trying to get some payback against the only team to beat it in the regular season last year. “I think the kids remember what happened last year when we played them, so our focus is going to be solely on them the next six days,” said STA coach Eric Cumba after his team’s 43-7 rout of Plymouth last weekend. (Incidentally, the Saints scored two more touchdowns while I was writing this column.) 2. Exeter (4-0 in Division I). Wins by 5, 8 and 1 point are a far cry from the way past Blue Hawks squads ran over their foes, but with unflappable quarterback Kyle Ball, they’re doing something right in the fourth quarter to close out these tough games. With the tiebreaker against Winnacunnet in their back pocket, and the rest of their conference struggling to win games, it’s easy to see the Blue Hawks winning the East and hosting a Division I quarterfinal on Nov. 7. Games against South Conference heavyweights Salem (Friday) and Pinkerton (Oct. 30) will determine how long Exeter will stay at home in November. 3. Marshwood (3-1 in Class B South). The Hawks learned a lot about themselves in last week’s 29-28 win at previously unbeaten Leavitt, but not all of it was good. They’re still trying to find that reliable second ball carrier behind standout Zach Doyon. Sophomore Kyle Glidden is making strides and junior quarterback Cole McDaniel, who replaced the injured Jack Spear early against Leavitt and will start this week, brings a speed element “We had some guys whose effort got better and some guys whose effort didn’t get better,” said Marshwood coach Alex Rotsko. “We haven’t started the same offensive line two weeks in a row going back to the scrimmage (against Portsmouth).” The Hawks get a lay-up Friday with struggling Gorham (0-4) coming to town, but next Friday’s trip to Kennebunk (4-0) will have major playoff implications, with the winner setting itself up for a potential No. 1 seed in the region. 4. Winnacunnet (2-2 in Division I). There’s no time for the Warriors to wonder what about might have been after late losses to Salem (26-21) and Exeter (21-20), not with a good Timberlane team coming to Hampton on Friday. Through one month of the season, Winnacunnet wins the award for most improved team on the Seacoast. Running backs Mike Lewis (510 yards) and Brian Auffant (429 yards) are both on pace for 1,000-yard seasons, and the offense has shown the ability to control games for stretches. But to make the playoffs it will need to win a couple of these money games, starting Friday. 5. York (1-3 in Class B South). Coach Randy Small and the Wildcats were left stunned after getting overtaken by Kennebunk in last week’s 42-14 loss, giving up five touchdowns in the final 1½ quarters. “I am speechless,” Small told Seacoast Media Group afterward. “I have no idea how a turn of events like that can happen. I just don’t.” No time for them to wallow, not with a competitive Biddeford team and its option attack coming to town Friday. Unbalanced schedules can be good or bad, but nobody in Class B South got handed a tougher slate this year than the Wildcats. 6. Portsmouth (1-3 in Division I). Any hopes of staying in the playoff race require a win at Londonderry (1-3) on Friday, but at this point the Clippers are just trying to build on some of the success they enjoyed in last week’s 42-28 win over Spaulding. “For us, it’s about continuing to improve, continuing to mature,” said Portsmouth coach Brian Pafford. There should be a whiff of desperation in the air Friday, with the loser stepping out of the Division I playoff picture. 7. Traip (1-3 in Class D South). Coach Ron Ross said his goal at the beginning of the season wasn’t to just make the playoffs (eight of nine teams in the division go), but stay out of the 6-7-8 seeds that would send it on the road for a tough quarterfinal. But that’s exactly what the offensively-challenged Rangers are looking at after getting shut out in back-to-back games against Maranacook (14-0) and Old Orchard Beach (30-0). The best case now would be springing a big home upset against Dirigo or Oak Hill, and taking care of business against winless Telstar to earn a spot in the 4-5 quarterfinal. 8. Epping-Newmarket (1-3 in Division III). September was a tough month for the Blue Devils, who’ll likely be lamenting the winnable games they couldn’t finish against Bishop Brady (20-14) and Stevens (26-13) when their slate is concluded.
