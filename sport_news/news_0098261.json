But Jones is no stranger to the Bulldogs. The new head coach was a part of Miller's staff back in 2008 and continued teaching at West York even after he left to coach at other schools, including York Suburban. \n\n\"I had a lot of those kids started as sophomores for me so I'm happy for them,\" explains Jones. \"I know they've been working hard for the past two or three years and I'm glad they're where they are.\" \n\nThis will be the first time Jones will be taking on his former team as a Bulldog. \n\n\"We're going to go out and do the best that we can.\" said Jones. \n\n\"It's kind of bittersweet going up against him,\" says Dajour Henderson, York Suburban's Running Back. \"It's going to be an exciting game. I know he's getting his guys ready for the game and we're over here getting ready too.\" \n\nKick off is set for 7 pm at West York for their homecoming game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:36:15.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
