The results, however, have been exactly the same. After losing center backs Ciaren Ward and Alex Aparicio, as well as goalkeeper Nick Rusek, to graduation following the 2014 season, Warwick needed a brand-new trio in front of goal. Ian Roeloffs had seen plenty of time in goal as Rusek’s backup last season, so he naturally slid into a starting role for his senior season. Blas Freshko was another player who had earned some varsity experience in the back as a junior, playing as the outside left back, and was a natural for one of the center back spots. Through spring and summer workouts, another senior, Nick Ferreira, emerged as the final player Warwick needed on the back line. Ferreira had played as an outside midfielder as a junior but his wrestling background was one reason why Warwick head coach John Van Pelt decided to switch his role. “Nick is a wrestler. I’ve had wrestlers in the past,” Van Pelt said. “They don’t quit. They don’t stop. They just keep playing.” Warwick’s defense has played as well as ever this season. The Wildcats are 9-2-1 through 12 games, outscoring opponents 33-9 with five clean sheets. The Ferreira-Freshko pairing in the back is a major part of Warwick’s success, although they make an unlikely duo despite their years of playing together on rec and travel teams. Freshko is the tall, strong good-in-the-air type of defender. Ferreira is technical, a smart passer in crowded situations. “We pretty much keep it basic,” Ferreira said. “We don’t have to communicate that much, even though we should. We just have an idea because we’ve played together for so long.” “I know the little things he’s going to do on the field and I always know he’s going to be there for a pass and vice versa,” Freshko said. Warwick plays Minisink Valley and Valley Central in OCIAA Division II games this upcoming week. The Wildcats are closing in on a ninth consecutive division title. Only Goshen, which has won 14 straight Division III titles, owns a longer streak among local teams. “Obviously, it’s a lot of pressure, but my brother (Kyle), he played varsity,” Roeloffs said. “He’s two years older than me and he played goalie also. The tradition, it’s really great to be a part of. What is it, eight years in a row? We’re going to make it nine this year and it’s great to be part of.” No matter which team Warwick draws in the opening round of the Section 9 Class AA tournament, the Wildcats know they’ll be challenged. Warwick learned that on Sept. 25, needing to rally from a 2-0 halftime deficit to beat Kingston in overtime, 3-2. “It’s going to be a tough fight no matter what team we have,” Roeloffs said. “I think we can’t go into any game thinking it’s going to be an easy game. We just have to go in as our captain Will Brack says, “play them like they’re the best team in the world.” By William Montgomery", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:12:34.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
