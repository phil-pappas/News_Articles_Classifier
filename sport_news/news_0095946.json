That put Albuquerque’s official rain total for October at 0.76 of an inch, just shy of the city’s normal rainfall total of 0.77 for this point in the month. The city’s normal rainfall level for the entire month is 1.02 inches.\nRainfall totals\nTotal in inches from Wednesday’s storms, midnight to 5 p.m.\nAlbuquerque airport — 0.58\nNortheast Heights — 1.00 – 1.50\nWest Side — 0.50 – 0.75\nSanta Fe — 1.30\nBelen — 0.54\nLas Cruces — 0.46\nClines Corners — 1.13 “It looks like we got above an inch in most of the Northeast Heights and more than an inch near Tramway,” Frazier said. “On the West Side, we had one-half to three-quarters of an inch.”\nHe said at least another half-inch of rain was in play for the metro area through this morning.\nHail described as the size of “fat marbles” pummeled Las Cruces and other parts of southern New Mexico on Wednesday afternoon, the second time this month that the region has been hammered by hail. Earlier in October, golf-ball size hail caused wide-spread damage to rooftops and cars in the area.\nWednesday’s hail, which was accompanied by heavy rain, piled up like snow in parks and front yards.\nFrazier said golf-ball sized hail pounded Melrose in Curry County in east-central New Mexico on Wednesday and there were reports of nickel-size hail in Socorro.\nHeavy rains and flooding in Curry County also prompted that county’s road department to close sections of several county roads.\nSki Santa Fe got at least 4 inches of snow, the season’s first measurable snowfall after a warm autumn that kept the ski basin mountainsides cloaked in aspen gold through this past weekend.\nFrazier said there also had been reports of snow at the higher elevations in the Sandia and Jemez mountains.\nChris Romero of the Natural Resources Conservation Service of New Mexico said Wednesday he did not expect snow accumulations from the storms late Tuesday through today to stick around.\n“We are just a few degrees away from freezing at most points (in higher elevations),” Romero said during a drought monitoring workgroup session. “The lowest temperature so far has been 31 degrees. It’s still pretty warm during the day. We have been getting up into the 40s.”\nChuck Jones, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Albuquerque office, said that despite exceptionally dry spans in August and September, New Mexico’s rainfall totals for the calendar year are still 136 percent of normal.\n“So we are still doing pretty good for the year,” Jones said.\nJournal staff writers Lauren Villagran in Las Cruces and Mark Oswald in Santa Fe contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/CVzCfh8gSY0?rel=0"], "published": "2015-10-22T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:14:25.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
