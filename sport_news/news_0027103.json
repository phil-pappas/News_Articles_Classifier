Gillespie returned his second pick 40 yards for a game-clinching touchdown with 30 seconds left in the final quarter. Southridge ended a four-game losing streak with Friday’s win and sent Wa-Hi to its third loss in four games. “We have a lot of respect for coach (Eric) Hisaw,” Suns coach Tony Reiboldt said. “It was a great win. We weren’t one dimensional. We played well in all three phases.” Both teams are now 1-3 in the MCC and 2-4 overall. The Blue Devils, playing without running back Brennan Barberich and tight end Carter Davis due to injury, struck first following a Suns’ three-and-out on the opening possession of the game. Quarterback Mitch Lesmeister slithered his way past the line of scrimmage, then gathered a head of steam that pushed him past linebackers and secondary defenders on his way to a 62-yard touchdown at the 8:52 mark of the first quarter. Bryar Jensen added the point after to give Wa-Hi a 7-0 lead. Southridge equalized just over three minutes later. The Suns blazed a 61-yard, 11-play trail that ended in the end zone after a 1-yard run by Al-Ghani that, coupled with a Hunter Spiva extra point, tied the game at 7-7 with 4:48 on the clock. “He’s the heart and soul of what we are,” Reiboldt said of Al-Ghani. “He runs hard.” “We moved the ball (well),” Al-Ghani said. “We started flowing (well).” The Blue Devils proved to be their own worst enemy in a scoreless second quarter. Wa-Hi suffered a turnover on downs at the Southridge 5, lost a fumble on a second-and-7 play at the Suns’ 7, and an interception in the final minute of period two. Southridge drove 57 yards in 10 plays on its first series of the second half. Spiva ended the possession, which was aided in part by an illegal-hands-to-the-face penalty, with a 21-yard field goal with 5:01 remaining in the third quarter which gave the Suns a 10-7 edge. Wa-Hi drove from its 20 to the Southridge 39 the next time it had the ball. But an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty did its part to kill the march. The Blue Devils’ next three series ended with a punt, a fourth-down incompletion, and Gillespie’s second pick of the night. “He’s steady,” Reiboldt said of Gillespie. “He rallies us on defense.” Wa-Hi outgained Southridge 302 yards to 261, but only 111 of its yards came after halftime. “We didn’t deserve to win,” Hisaw said. “We were terrible on offense. We (took) turns imploding. “We defended well and got big stops,” Hisaw said. “I was pleased with our courage and heart.” Lesmeister rushed for 83 yards and Sam Hoe added 68 on 13 totes for the Blue Devils. “Sam is a warrior,” Hisaw said. “He’s fearless. He played well for us on both sides of the ball.” Wa-Hi hits the road next Friday for a 7 p.m. contest with Chiawana at Edgar Brown Stadium in Pasco.
