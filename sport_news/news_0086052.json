She said police still don't have a motive in the case.\nThe shooting occurred on the same day President Obama was visiting survivors and the families of victims of last week's mass shootings at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon.\nUniversity President John Rudley said the school, which has about 9,700 students, is no longer on lockdown. But he criticized what he said was a culture among students who believe they shouldn't snitch on each other.\n\"We're in the inner city. Crime is all around us. Our students have to be more vigilant,\" he said during a press conference Friday afternoon.\nRudley said the student who was killed was a freshman at the school, though the student's name and age haven't been released. Silva said the second victim, whose name also hasn't been released, was shot twice and is hospitalized in stable condition.\nThe incident occurred just hours after another shooting near the same housing complex. It's unclear whether the shootings were related.\n\"My main concern is what they're going to do now,\" said Daijsa Fowls, a 19-year-old pharmacy student from Houston. \"There's no enforcement. There's no way that outsiders should be allowed in a person's dorm room. I'm supposed to be moving on campus and it shakes me up.\"\nFowls noted that she had a 3-year-old son, and said she wouldn't feel safe walking with him on campus.\n\"A bullet has no name,\" she said. \"It could hit anybody.\"\nBrittney Solomon, 19-year-old psychology student, added: \"It's really nerve-racking feeling that a person here could have a gun.\"\nThe university said in a statement that earlier shooting occurred early Friday morning, and that the school was increasing police presence on campus. Details about the earlier shooting weren't immediately available.\nClasses were cancelled following the second shooting. Rudley said classes would resume on a normal schedule Monday.\nThe incidents follow a fatal shooting earlier Friday at Northern Arizona University, where an overnight confrontation between students escalated into gunfire that killed one person and wounded three others. Last week, eight students and a teacher were fatally shot at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. The gunman in the Oregon shooting also wounded nine people before turning the gun on himself.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:16:04.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
