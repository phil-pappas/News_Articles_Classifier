They will be looking to even the series in Game 4 as 40-year-old knuckleballer R.A. Dickey goes up against 6-foot-10 Royals’ right-hander Chris Young. Here’s what you need to know about today’s game.\nToronto Blue Jays vs. Kansas City Royals\nALCS Game 4\nRogers Centre\nFirst pitch : 4:07 p.m. EST\nRoof status: Not officially announced yet, but with a 40-per-cent chance of rain at game time, expect it to be closed as it has been throughout the post-season.\nStarting pitchers: RH R.A. Dickey (11-11, 3.91) vs. RH Chris Young (11-6, 3.06)\nTV: Fox Sports-1, simulcast in Canada on Sportsnet.\nProjected lineups:\nBlue Jays:\nBen Revere – LF\nJosh Donaldson – 3B\nJose Bautista – RF\nEdwin Encarnacion – DH\nChris Colabello – 1B\nTroy Tulowitzki – SS\nRussell Martin – C\nKevin Pillar – CF\nRyan Goins – 2B\nRoyals:\nAlcides Escobar – SS\nBen Zobrist – 2B\nLorenzo Cain – CF\nEric Hosmer – 1B\nKendrys Morales – DH\nMike Moustakas – 3B\nSal Perez – C\nAlex Gordon – LF\nAlex Rios – RF\nYoung’s the man\nJohn Rieger\nChris Young, an extreme fly-ball pitcher, is slated to start Game 4 for the Royals. He went 11-6 with a 3.06 ERA during the regular season.\nRoyals’ manager Ned Yost said he had no reservations about going with Chris Young, an extreme fly-ball pitcher, to start Game 4, citing his career numbers against the Jays (he has held Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki to just seven combined hits in 47 career at-bats). But Young, who had the highest fly-ball rate of any starting pitcher this season, has never pitched at the Rogers Centre, which is traditionally an inhospitable place for fly-ball pitchers.\nBullpen rested\nCharlie Riedel\nKansas City Royals relief pitcher Kelvin Herrera warms up in the bullpen during Game 2 of the ALDS against the Astros. The Royals’ bullpen was the best in the American League this year.\nOne bright side for the Royals in Game 3 is how they did not have to use any of their marquee bullpen arms — Wade Davis, Ryan Madson, Kelvin Herrera or Luke Hochevar — in the loss. That means the fearsome quartet will be well-rested and available to pitch in both Game 4 and Game 5. “Now we’ve got two more games here, we can go ahead and pour the coals on them,” Yost said. The Royals’ bullpen was the best in the American League this year.\nHot wings\nRick Madonik\nDespite a lingering finger injury, Edwin Encarnacion is tied for the team lead with 10 post-season hits.\nDespite dealing with a sprained middle finger on his left hand, Jays’ designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion has looked no worse for wear of late. He’s tied for the team lead with 10 post-season hits and he has multiple hits in four of the last five games, racking up six singles, a double and a homer in that span.\nPlayers to watch:\nRussell Martin\nThe Jays’ catcher has faced Chris Young more than any of his teammates and he has fared well against him in his career, going 9-for-30 with a pair of doubles and six walks.\nAlcides Escobar\nThe Royals’ speedy lead-off hitter, who already has seven hits this series, is 6-for-18 vs. Dickey in his career.\nMore on thestar.com\nWhat they’re saying in Kansas City: ‘No precedent for Cueto’s stink’ in loss to Jays\nToronto Symphony Orchestra dedicates song to the Blue Jays before ALDS Game 5 win", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:08:46.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
