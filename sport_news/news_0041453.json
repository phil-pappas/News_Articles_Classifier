(AP) — One jaw-dropping catch by Francis Owusu nearly overshadowed a record-setting performance from Christian McCaffrey. Owusu pinned the ball on the back of a defender in the end zone for one of the most memorable catches in recent memory and McCaffrey did most of the rest with a school-record 243 yards rushing and four touchdowns in No. 15 Stanford’s 56-35 victory over No. 18 UCLA on Thursday. “That’s one of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen,” McCaffrey said. He was talking about Owusu’s catch but others could have said it about McCaffrey’s own performance. He scored on a 70-yard run out of the wildcat, returned a kick 96 yards to set up another score and ran for three more touchdowns in a virtuoso performance that broke Toby Gerhart’s school record of 223 yards rushing in a game set in 2009. McCaffrey finished with 369 all-purpose yards as the Cardinal (5-1, 4-0 Pac-12) beat the Bruins (4-2, 1-2) for the eighth straight time. Stanford QB Kevin Hogan threw for 131 yards and three TDs on eight completions and McCaffrey took over the national lead in all-purpose yards with 1,518 for the Cardinal.
