Webb — A Texoma striper history lesson \nA friend of a friend of mine was cleaning out his files and found this article in the Whitesboro News Record paper from April 29, 1965. I thought you all might like a little history lesson about the start of a journey that was to make Texoma one of the best striper lakes in the country. This is the way the article goes: \n“A close check is being kept on a special release of striped bass into Lake Texoma. The new fish is like a sand bass’s brother just a lot bigger but similar in several ways,” said Leland Roberts, Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Department fisheries chief, headed up a delegation of Wildlife department personnel releasing the new species Wednesday of last week. The release was made on the Red River arm up stream from the lake. The Texoma release consisted of 416 pounds of Stripers ranging in size from 3 to 12 lbs. \nFirst announcements of the release stressed that the season is closed and will remain that way on the stripers until official notice from the Wildlife Department that it is lifted. This closed season was declared to let the fish spawn and develop. \nAdult striped bass have been introduced into Lake Texoma in order to develop a new sport fishery department, officials stated. To protect these fish all waters of the State of Oklahoma have been closed to Striped Bass fishing. Striped bass caught while fishing for other species must be returned to the water unharmed imminently. Notices of these rules have been posted all over Texoma in Oklahoma and Texas areas of fishing. \nOther than the size, anglers who might hook a striper can tell it from the regular sand bass by three primary characteristics. The stripes of the new species are more prominent, the back is not arched and the spines at the lower are more slender. Should the species develop as is hoped they will obtain weights of 40 pounds or more. It is not known how well the striped bass will do in Texoma. It’s a new action being tried out. \nOfficials said the release was made in the upper Red River arm of Texoma to help the fish spawn. They need moving water to spawn. It was also announced another load of smaller stripers was also released here to enhance their chances of surviving. \nThe striper is also known as a rock bass, rock fish, sea bass and rock squid hound. It is of the same genus of the sand bass with similar habits. The fish with 7 or 8 prominent stripes, spawn in fresh water. Females can lay up to 5 million eggs that will hatch in 30 to 60 hours. They feed primarily on shad. The release that Wednesday in April, 1965, was the 2nd attempt to introduce the striped bass to Texoma waters. \nThe fish were obtained from North Carolina. Few states have reported much success with trying to transplant the game fish. Department officers believe if the fish adapt it will be a management tool as they would keep the rough fish population down and serve as an excellent sport fish. It is suggested that anyone catching a striper handle it as little as possible and quickly return it to the lake.” \nNow this is almost word for word the way it is written. We all know how successful this program has turned out. Texoma is known nationwide for its striper fishery. Thank you, Oklahoma, for bringing this great fish to Texoma waters. Thank you to whomever wrote this article for the Whitesboro paper back in 1965. \nI have been busy the last couple of weeks helping build a fence and tear down a storage building. I don’t have much to report about what I have been doing fishing wise as I haven’t been on the water in a little while. One more day on the shed and I’m going.
