(AP) â€” The Los Angeles Angels have hired longtime Yankees executive Billy Eppler as general manager.\nThe Angels announced the hiring Sunday night, several hours after their season ended with a loss at Texas.\nThe 40-year-old Eppler replaces interim GM Bill Stoneman, who took over after Jerry Dipoto quit his job at midseason following his latest disagreement with Mike Scioscia, the longest-serving manager in baseball.\nEppler is a San Diego native who spent the past 11 seasons with the Yankees. Originally hired as the assistant director of baseball operations, he rose to assistant general manager for the past four seasons, working alongside Brian Cashman.\nThe Angels finished third in the AL West at 85-77, missing out on a wild card playoff spot on the final weekend.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
