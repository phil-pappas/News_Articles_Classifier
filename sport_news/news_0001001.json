A loss would be damaging for FAU's fading bowl hopes. The Owls haven't been to a bowl since 2008.\nAbout FAU: The Owls are still reeling from last week's disappointing loss to Rice. FAU led by 12 in the fourth quarter before allowing two late touchdowns. The offense could be in trouble, with quarterback Jaquez Johnson (ankle) and running back Jay Warren (ribs) dealing with nagging injuries. Leading receiver Jenson Stoshak (shoulder) is also a game-time decision. Defensively, the Owls have been anchored by their solid defensive line, led by senior Trevon Coley. Safety Jalen Young (concussion) is also questionable.\nAbout Marshall: The Thundering Herd has won four games in a row since losing to Ohio the second week of the season. Quarterback Chase Litton leads an offense that is averaging 31.7 points. Litton has completed 70 of 123 passes for 796 yards and 10 touchdowns. Running back Devon Johnson leads the team with 472 yards and four touchdowns. The Thundering Herd also features kick returner Deandre Reaves, who is among the nation's best. Reaves is averaging 30.7 yards a return.\nWhat to watch:\n1. How will the Owls respond after last week's debacle? Despite the loss to Rice, the players and coaches were in good spirits. Will blowing a double-digit, fourth-quarter lead last week affect the team mentally, especially with so many young players?\n2. Johnson's heath remains an issue. He's been limited as a runner, which plays a large role in his success. Johnson had the Owls in position to win last week, but the lack of mobility has affected the play-calling. Backup Jason Driskel, who was solid the two games he replaced Johnson, could be called upon.\n3. Running back Trey Rodriguez has provided a spark to the Owls' offense. Versatility is his biggest asset because he can affect the game as a runner or receiver out of the backfield. With Warren ailing, this could be sort of a coming out party for Rodriguez. He's is expected to play large role in the offense.\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n Florida Atlantic Owls Marshall Thundering Herd Rice Owls Conference USA Boca Raton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:45:18.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
