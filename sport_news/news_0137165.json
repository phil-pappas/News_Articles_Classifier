Matt DiSalvo paced CNU with a 4-over 144, while F&M’s Brad Lankler won the medal. \nWomen’s golf: \nWilliam and Mary’s Alessandra Liu won the Pinehurst (N.C.) Challenge with a three-round, 10-under-par 206, a school and tournament record. That helped the Tribe finish sixth. \nOld Dominion’s Rachel Walker tied for third by shooting a final-round 68, though ODU, with three players, didn’t factor in the team score. \nMen’s soccer: \nJoe Iraola’s goal in the 12th minute stood up as American (9-4-1) won 1-0 at Virginia (7-3-2). \nWomen’s soccer: \nHost Old Dominion (5-9, 3-2 Conference USA) beat Alabama Birmingham 2-0 on goals by Kira Laurento in the first half and Deirdre Bradley in the second. \nSwimming: \nWilliam and Mary's Jessie Ustjanauskas and Jeremiah O'Donnell were named the Colonial Athletic Association women's and men's Swimmers of the Week, respectively, after both Tribe teams defeated Towson last weekend. \nUstjanauskas was undefeated in four races against the Tigers, sweeping the butterfly events and swimming on two relays. \nO'Donnell also went 4-for-4 with two individual victories and two relay wins. He swam a lifetime-best 55.79 seconds in the 100-yard breaststroke. \nWomen's bowling: \nNorfolk State was chosen third and Hampton fifth in the MEAC's Southern Division in a poll of coaches and SIDs. \nN.C. A&T was tabbed as the Southern favorite, while Maryland Eastern Shore was chosen as the Northern favorite. \nSite switches: \nThe Big South will move its basketball, baseball and outdoor track and field championships from Coastal Carolina and the Myrtle Beach, S.C., area, conference commissioner Kyle Kallander announced. Big South bylaws stipulate that members leaving with less than two years’ notice are not eligible to host championships, and Coastal Carolina announced Aug. 31 that it will join the Sun Belt Conference as of July 1, 2016. \nThe men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, which were planned to be held at the same time, will be split into a March 3-6 event for men and a March 10-13 bracket for women.
