At the time Hayden said the coach was \"not healthy\" An unnamed player told the Los Angeles Times that the coach \"did not seem right\" when he met with the team on Sunday morning. \nSarkisian drew attention last August when he slurred his words and used profanity at the football team's \"Salute Troy\" prep rally.\nHayden concluded the firing announcement by saying the university was concerned about the troubled coach. \n\"Through all of this we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well being,\" he wrote.\nThe Trojans are 3-2 this year after last week's Thursday night 17-12 loss to Washington.  \nCopyright 2015 RNN.
