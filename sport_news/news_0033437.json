Image 25 of 25 Tracking down the man who voted the Aggies No. 1 1 / 25 Back to Gallery Josh Kendall is a rebel. A revolutionary. An AP renegade with a disdain for the status quo.\nOK, maybe not.\nJosh Kendall is the South Carolina football beat writer for GoGamecocks.com, and he's the only one of 61 Associated Press voters who deemed Texas A&M worthy of first-place.\nThe other teams receiving first-place votes: No. 1 Ohio State (38), No. 2 TCU (5), No. 3 Baylor (10) and No. 5 Utah (7).\nKendall has no ties to A&M. He's not an alum, Aggie blood doesn't run through his bloodlines and Kevin Sumlin didn't slip him a Franklin.\nSo what gives?\n\"There's nobody, frankly, that I love,\" Kendall told the Express-News. \"There's no team that I think, 'Yeah, that's the No. 1 team in the country.' \"\n\"I like what the Aggies have done. I think Sumlin can coach. But I think people are worried they're going to fall off.\"\nKendall may not be a full-fledged mutineer, but he is a breath of fresh air, the rare voter with blinders who can be quick to shun the consensus.\n\"I tend the be the outlier...I wish there were more outliers, I think the groupthink clouds up the whole system and we shouldn't all be thinking the same way,\" Kendall said.\n\"The fact that everybody votes in such lockstep normally is just wrong to me.\"\nHe's certainly an exception, but the battle against conformity isn't being waged by a one-man battalion. Last week, John Adams of the Knoxville News Sentinel cast his first-place vote for the No. 10 Utes, who became the lowest-ranked team to receive an AP first-place vote this late in the season since Week 15 of 2007.\nStill, it seems voters like Kendall and Adams are few and far between.\nThere are 16 undefeated teams currently ranked in the AP Top 25, yet, only five received a first-place vote.\nHas No. 1 Ohio State, who beat Northern Illinois and Indiana by seven points each, really done enough to convince 38 writers they're the best team in the country?\nMost will deny it, but a school's preseason rank and performance the prior season tend to play a big role in voter's minds, and it can blind them to the actual state of play.\nThat's not so with Kendall, who had the Buckeyes at No. 5 in his most recent poll — fellow anarchist Adams actually had them at no. 9, with A&M at No. 4.\nAs for where Kendall thinks the Aggies end up?\n\"It'll play itself out. I'm not saying they're going to win the national championship, I'm just saying right now, I think they're the best team in the country.\"\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/74/46/8636838/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/36/8759177/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/12/8725134/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/02/8700076/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/02/8700076/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/05/74/8675087/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/11/8749664/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/05/52/8673925/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/02/02/8659093/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/20/8717368/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/63/50/8600068/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/26/8729995/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/36/8759177/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/11/8749662/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/65/8736092/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/11/8749662/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/17/13/8712940/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/12/8725132/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/11/8737364/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/17/13/8712929/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/11/8749663/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/11/8749663/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/11/8737364/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/17/13/8712940/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/11/8749664/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/05/52/8673925/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/65/8736098/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/02/02/8659093/5/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/63/50/8600068/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/12/8725138/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/65/8736094/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/12/8725137/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/02/8700074/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/02/8700074/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/12/8725138/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/74/46/8636838/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/65/8736097/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/12/8725134/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/17/13/8712929/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/65/8736098/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/65/8736092/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/65/8736094/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/20/8717368/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/12/8725132/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/26/8729995/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/05/74/8675087/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/65/8736097/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/12/8725137/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:36:22.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
