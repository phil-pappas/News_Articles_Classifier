Like the rest of the offense, the sophomore wore a cardinal jersey.\nInterim coach Clay Helton said the move was made mainly because USC’s receiving corps is banged up.\n“We just want to make sure that Adoree’ is totally prepared – that, if and when he goes in, he can help us,” said Helton, whose Trojans (3-3 overall, 1-2 Pac-12) play host to No.3 Utah (6-0, 3-0) on Saturday. “Obviously, he’ll still help us on defense. But he can play a major role for us (on offense). When he touches the ball, everybody holds their breath.”\nJackson’s snaps on offense have been on the rise. After playing a season-high 30 offensive snaps against Washington, Jackson was in for 26 plays on that side of the ball in USC’s 41-31 loss to Notre Dame last week. Before that, Jackson hadn’t played more than nine offensive snaps in a game this season.\nWhen Jackson gets the ball, good things generally happen. Jackson had one reception against the Fighting Irish, and it went for an 83-yard touchdown. He has 11 catches on the season for 279 yards – a 25.4-yard average. Almost all of his 279 receiving yards have come after the catch.\nReceivers coach Tee Martin estimated that Jackson knows 90-95 percent of the offense.\n“Conceptually, he know pretty much everything that we do,” Martin said. “He’s smart. He just gets football. I think that helps him. He sees the concepts on defense, then he comes on offense, and I think it increases his understanding of the game.”\nReceivers Steven Mitchell Jr. (ankle) and Isaac Whitney (collarbone) did not play against Notre Dame. Darreus Rogers (hamstring) lasted only a half. None practiced Tuesday.\nCANDIDATE KYLE?\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham is considered a potential candidate to take over the USC program after the season. He declined to comment when asked about that possibility Tuesday.\n“I never make any comments on any job speculation one way or the other,” Whittingham said during the weekly Pac-12 coaches’ conference call. “Why speculate on speculation? It doesn’t make sense. … That’s always been my stance.”\nWhittingham, 55, has a career record of 91-43, including 8-1 in bowl games. The Utes are 6-0 after finishing 9-4 last season.\nBROWNE ‘100 PERCENT’ BACK\nBackup quarterback Max Browne, a third-year sophomore, is on pace to graduate in December. As such, he could transfer to another school without having to sit out a year.\n1 2 Next Page Related: VIDEO: Clay Helton on chippy Trojans, recruiting USC interim coach Clay Helton proud of the effort against Fighting Irish Pete Carroll to USC 'not happening' - nor should it Trojans report card: Notre Dame 41, USC 31 Mistakes doom USC at Notre Dame in Clay Helton's debut", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/usc-688061-notre-dame.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/usc/usc-688138-notre-report.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/usc/helton-688350-usc-chippy.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/usc/carroll-688309-pete-usc.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/helton-688130-game-usc.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:09:56.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
