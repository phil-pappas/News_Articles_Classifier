Huguely V in the beating death of Yeardley Love, a 22-year-old from suburban Baltimore. \nHuguely’s lawyers argued that he was denied the right to a fair trial after one of his attorneys became too sick to appear in court and the trial judge allowed proceedings to go ahead anyway. \nThe Virginia Supreme Court refused to hear Huguely’s appeal last year. \nHuguely’s slaying of the suburban Baltimore woman occurred in May 2010 in Charlottesville. The two had had an on-again, off-again relationship. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:39:31.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
