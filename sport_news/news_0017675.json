She is significantly ahead in the buildout of her operations, as financial reports filed Thursday with federal regulators show.\nClinton has about five times as many employees as does Sanders, as well as offices across the country and powerful voter research tools already in place. As for Sanders, he only recently hired a pollster.\nSanders plans to air his first TV ads around Thanksgiving, roughly three months after Clinton began putting spots on the air.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
