The Dover High School football team, which has won three games since being thrust into Division I at the beginning of the 2013 season, stood toe-to-toe with two-time defending champion Pinkerton — a school with more than twice Dover's enrollment — for three quarters Friday night. Only in the fourth quarter did the Astros — fighting for their playoff lives — pull away for a 48-21 victory at Dunaway Field. \"Hanging with Pinkerton for three quarters, that's impressive, especially with the young group of guys we have,\" said Dover senior co-captain Nate Stegman. \"If any game shows you how far we've come, this is the game.\" Dover (1-7) trailed 21-14 after three quarters, but any thought of a big upset went away on the first play of the fourth, when the Astros scored on a 79-yard touchdown pass. Dover went three-and-out on its next drive, and Pinkerton (6-2) responded with a four-play, 56-yard drive that ended in a 23-yard touchdown run. Just like that, the visitors were up 35-14. \"I was real proud of the way our guys came out in the first half,\" Dover coack Ken Osbon said. \"We did some nice things and played hard.\" The first half was a memorable one for the Green Wave. After Erik Stephens recovered a fumble (which Stegman forced) on Pinkerton's third snap of the game to give Dover the ball on the Astros' 37-yard line, the Green Wave responded with a 10-play drive that ended with a 1-yard run by Jack Brandin for a 6-0 lead. Dover's attempt at a fake for a 2-point conversion failed. \"I thought they gave us everything we could handle in the first half,\" Pinkerton coach Brian O'Reilly said. \"They did a nice job scheme-wise and we had to make some adjustments at halftime to get our running game going.\" The play of the game for Dover occurred just before halftime, when Caleb Bolden forced a fumble on a punt return and pounced on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown. Bolden took the 2-point conversion into the end zone to give Dover a 14-7 lead with 1:49 to go before the break. \"Coach always tells us to run down the field hard,\" Bolden said. \"I did that, knocked him on his butt, recovered it.\" Things might have been different for Dover had it been able to convert two trips deep into Pinkerton territory into points — the Green Wave turned the ball over on downs at the Astros' 1-yard line in the second quarter and again at the 5 late in the third. Dover also was hurt on a number of defensive breakdowns, as all seven of Pinkerton's touchdowns were the result of — or immediately followed — big gains. Pinkerton scored on touchdown runs of 40, 34, 23, 19 and 59 yards, while another touchdown was preceded by a run of 68 yards. \"There are two ways to look at the second half — either we woke up the bear or they wore us out,\" Osbon said. \"Either way, nothing on our kids. They played hard and did the best they could. I'm proud of the effort.\" Dover scored its final touchdown of the night late in the game when John Cantwell threw a 59-yard pass to Bolden, cutting Pinkerton's lead to 41-21 at the time. Dover will wrap up the season next Friday at home against rival Portsmouth.
