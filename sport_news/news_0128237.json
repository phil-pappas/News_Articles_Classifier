Excellent cuts, reading/using blocks. 7-0 #ECU #ECUFOOTBALL #ECUvsBYU — Bubba Rosenbaum (@BubbaRosenbaum) October 10, 2015 \nNot long after that ECU blocked a BYU punt and scored a touchdown to go up 14-0 in the first quarter. DB Trevian Hicks with the block on #BYUs rugby punt attempt; Yiannis Bowden with the recovery in the end-zone. #ECUvsBYU ECU 14-0 — Tailgat3 (@Tailgat3) October 11, 2015 \nThings looked bad for BYU, but then the defense started playing as did the offense. \nMangum and company started moving the ball and then the freshman signal-caller found veteran running back Algie Brown for a short dump off and the touchdown. T. Mangum pass to A. Brown for 22 yds for a TD #BYUvsECU #GoCougs http://t.co/loqvVTVYDM — Daniel Haslam (@DanHaslam) October 11, 2015 \nThen after that, BYU decided to return the favor. BYU returning the favor with a punt block of their own and a TD 2 plays later. #GoCougs — John Toronto (@JohnToronto1) October 11, 2015 this BYU ECU game is nuts. ECU Td, block punt, ECU Td, BYU TD, Block Punt, BYU on the 1 — Evan Roberts (@ER) October 11, 2015 \nThree plays later, Brown punched it into the end zone to tie the game at 14. — BYU Photo (@BYUphoto) October 11, 2015 \nAt that point, BYU had the momentum and went on a tear, scoring 14 unanswered points to go up 28-14. \nECU brought in quarterback Blake Kemp, who started moving the ball for the Pirates, but every time ECU gained some yards it turned it over. Three series' in a row as a matter of fact. Another nice drive by ECU stopped by a forced fumble (Davis) and recovery (Warner). Defense bends, but no break. #BYUSN #BYU — BYU Sports Nation (@BYUSportsNation) October 11, 2015 \nAfter the last ECU turnover, Mangum ran for a first down and hurt his hamstring and was out for the majority of the second half. That's when ECU took advantage. \nThe Pirates moved the ball and kept finding the end zone and true freshman Beau Hoge was doing his best at the quarterback spot for Mangum, but he couldn't get the Cougars rolling. Hate seeing @tannermangum out, but it's fun to see @beauhoge in there. Northern Kentucky represent! # #ecuvsbyu — Nick Newman (@nicknewman801) \nECU takes a Beau Hoge interception and turns it into a 33-yard field goal. 38-38 4:01 left. — Alex Clark (@alclark35) \nMangum felt his legacy wasn't already cemented this season, and he returned to the game, injured, and led the Cougars down the field. \nMangum started hitting passes and opened up the running game. He led BYU down into the \"Blue Zone\" and with 19 seconds left Brown got into the end zone to put the Cougars ahead. \nBrown had a monster game with 134 yards and three touchdowns, but everyone was talking about Mangum at the end of the night. Tanner Mangum is so special. His poise and moxie are comparable to John Beck already. He is the next great BYU QB. Such toughness as well. — KYLE F GUNTHER (@GuntherKFAN) October 11, 2015 In all 4 of BYU's wins with Tanner Mangum at QB, BYU was tied or trailing in the 4th quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:18:27.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
