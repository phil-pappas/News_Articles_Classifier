RPI hockey hosts top-ranked Boston College on Sunday 1  /  1 Back to Gallery RPI will have to chisel out a lot more minutes like the final 27 of Friday night's season opener. Otherwise, the Engineers have no chance against No. 1-ranked Boston College on Sunday afternoon.\nEngineers coach Seth Appert figured it was late in the second period at UMass-Lowell when his team started showing signs of life, enough to return home and perhaps make something of the special Houston Field House opener.\n\"You start at the last seven minutes of the second period, and the entire third, and we were determined to play the right way,\" Appert said. \"We had a lot of scoring chances.\"\nMore Information \nRPI vs. No. 1 Boston College \nWhen: 2 p.m. Sunday\nWhere: Houston Field House\n\nRPI lost, 3-0, to the country's 14th-ranked team while BC started the season with a 5-1 win at Army.\nBoth teams would say it's \"focus on ourselves\" time this early in the season.\nAppert has a chance to see if this group will require multiple reminders to learn the same lesson.\nLast year's did, and went 12-26-3.\nAppert called it the necessary building of \"the will of the locker room.\"\nHis goalie, Jason Kasdorf , said the will is there. He made 35 saves (15 in the second period) after the team's slow start, which included a 2-0 deficit after the first period on a rebound goal and a power-play blast. RPI was out-shot 31-14 through the first 40 minutes but won the third period, 13-7. No goals were scored in the final period.\n\"One thing I liked: We got better as the game went on,\" Kasdorf said. \"We were working hard. There were positive attitudes. I think we can build on that fast.\"\nRPI quickly cleaned up, ate and boarded a bus for a three-hour drive. The crew arrived home about 1 a.m., and Appert opted for a light 10 a.m. skate Saturday.\nAppert downplayed the quick travel and game turnaround, noting how back-to-back games are the norm.\nThe keys, Kasdorf said, would be resting and rehydrating.\nThis could be an interesting home-ice tone setter for RPI. The Engineers face Michigan and rival Union in upcoming home games.\nFirst, RPI has to deal with a loaded team, led by Jerry York — who Appert called the best coach in America — that had freshmen score three of its five goals at West Point. One of them, Miles Wood , was a fourth-round draft pick of the New Jersey Devils in 2013. He turned 20 in September. \nBig, strong, fast, particularly tenacious on defense — BC's no different than what you'd expect of a No. 1 team in football or basketball.\n\"It's what this month's about,\" Appert said. \"Facing really good teams.\"\nIt can be difficult to get these kinds of high-profile visits. Union and RPI collaborated a few years ago to secure a 4-for-2 home game deal with Michigan.\nBut Appert said this one was relatively simple. BC needed a home game in 2013 and agreed to return it straight-up two years later.\nThe 10th-year coach's only concern (a small one, really) was the crowd. He wondered just how electric it would be, considering it's a Sunday afternoon of a three-day holiday weekend for RPI students — many of whom barely were born the last time BC visited — Feb. 2, 1995, a 7-2 RPI victory. \nOddly, that's the same score as BC's win against the Engineers two seasons ago.\nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:05:21.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
