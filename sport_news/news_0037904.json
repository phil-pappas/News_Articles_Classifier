Among those close enough to taste it: Germany, which will claim a spot as long as it does not lose in Dublin on Thursday (2:45 p.m., ESPN), and Portugal, which also leads its group. Portugal faces the same math as the Germans — just don’t lose — when it hosts second-place Denmark in Braga on Thursday (2:45 p.m., ESPN Deportes). Wales must wait until Saturday to claim its first-ever place in the Euros; it needs only a tie at Bosnia and Herzegovina.

United States vs. Mexico at the Rose Bowl on Saturday night (9:30 p.m., Fox Sports 1). The winning team goes to the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia, its coach celebrated as a genius tactician and motivator who preserved the nation’s honor. The losing side spontaneously combusts amid spasms of second-guessing, hand-wringing and blame. So, you know, it should be fun.
