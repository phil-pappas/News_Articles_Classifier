I guess everybody’s different. Just depends from your character or your approach to tennis and generally to everyday commitments,” he said. \n“I thought I should always try to improve in every possible occasion. Every time I’m on the court I see things I can be better on.” \nNext up for the seemingly unstoppable Serb, who won three out of four Grand Slam finals this year to reach 10 major titles, is Spain’s David Ferrer, who beat Taiwanese wildcard Lu Yen-hsun 6-3 6-1. \nEarlier, life was a little trickier for Nadal as he was forced to come from a set down against America’s Jack Sock before setting up a chance for revenge in the semi-finals against Fabio Fognini. \nThe out-of-sorts Spanish great, scrapping to recover his form after a tough year, was outgunned by Sock’s howitzer forehand but he dug deep to see off the world No.30 3-6 6-4 6-3. \n“Yes, it was an important victory for me. Obviously I finished the match playing better than what I started. It’s important because I came back,” Nadal said. \nNadal, into his first hardcourt semi-final for more than a year, will now face Fognini, who has beaten him three times this season including in last month’s US Open third round. \n“He’s a great player. When you play against a great player, especially if you don’t play to your best, your chances are lower,” Nadal said of the Italian, who beat Uruguay’s Pablo Cuevas 6-1 2-6 6-2. \n“If I am able to play my best tomorrow … I am going to have my chances. If not, it’s going to be tough. It’s simple.” \nIn the women’s draw, Ana Ivanovic beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-3 7-5 to set up a semi-final with Timea Bacsinszky, who recovered from a first-set “bagel” to beat Sara Errani 0-6 6-3 7-5. \nAgnieszka Radwanska beat Angelique Kerber 6-1 6-4 to go into a semi-final clash with the in-form Garbine Muguruza, who halted the run of American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-1 7-5.
