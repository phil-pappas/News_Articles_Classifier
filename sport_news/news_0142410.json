(USATSI) LSU played host to South Carolina on Saturday due to flooding in Columbia. While the Tigers did everything they could to make the Gamecocks feel at home prior to the game, they were not the most welcome hosts once the game started. \nThe Tigers won 45-24 to remain undefeated and they did so, once again, behind a stellar performance from star running back Leonard Fournette. Fournette rushed for 158 yards on 20 carries, picking up a touchdown -- an 87-yard run right up the middle to open the third quarter. \n\nLeonard Fournette is unreal, my god... pic.twitter.com/6cGtuPCmMp \nâ€” Rob Perez (@World_Wide_Wob) October 10, 2015 That run put Fournette over 1,000 yards on the season, which made him the fastest LSU player to 1,000 rushing yards in a season and tied the FBS record by getting there in five games -- a tie between 10 other players. Among the names Fournette tied on Saturday are the likes of Marcus Allen, Barry Sanders and Ricky Williams. \nThe 158 yards was actually Fournette's lowest single-game rushing total this year, as LSU rested him late with the game well in hand. Fournette's 1,022 yards through five games is the eighth-most in FBS history. \nThe Tigers are yet to get to the hardest part of their schedule, but no matter what happens record-wise for LSU, if Fournette keeps up this kind of pace the rest of the season it's hard to see him not getting some hardware in New York in December.
