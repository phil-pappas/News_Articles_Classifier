(Photo: EWU) \nby EWU Athletics \nIt didn't take long for Cooper Kupp to overcome more than 50 years of Big Sky Conference football history. But it took an eternity -- 60 minutes to be exact -- for the Eagles to put away the opportunistic Bears. \nJordan Dascalo made a 44-yard field goal with no time remaining on a day in which Kupp became the league's all-time leader in receptions and reception yards, lifting Eastern Washington past Northern Colorado 43-41 Saturday (Oct. 24) at Nottingham Field in Greeley, Colo. \nThe Eagles rallied from deficits five times, and needed a nine-play, 49-yard drive that took 1:19 off the clock to set-up Dascalo's game-winning kick. That came after UNC scored with 1:23 to play on a three-play drive following a successful onside kick. \nNormally EWU's punter, Dascalo had to take on kicking duties recently as an injury replacement. \n\"It was one of those hard-fought games on the road,\" said Eastern head coach Beau Baldwin. \"At different times they felt in control, and then we felt in control up 12. But give them credit - they made plays. Ultimately it took us to go down and make a big field goal by Dascalo. When he hit it there was never a doubt - he drilled it. Give him credit, he hasn't kicked a lot of those. He does in practice, but he hasn't been our field goal kicker. But he keeps getting better and better. He just hasn't kicked much in the past.\" \nKupp finished with school records of 20 catches and 275 yards, and also scored three touchdowns. That brought his career totals to 281 receptions, 4,338 yards and 52 touchdowns. A pair of second quarter grabs broke the previous league receptions record of 268 held by Kasey Dunn of Idaho (1988-91). A 19-yard reception during a last-minute touchdown drive in the second quarter surpassed the previous league record of 4,140 yards held by EWU's Eric Kimble (2002-05). \nKupp has played only 35 games in his career, and now finds himself within striking distance of several FCS records, including the touchdown record. He now has 52 TD receptions in his career, just six behind the record of 58. \nEastern is now 5-2 on the season with a five-game winning streak, but the first three wins came by a total of just 14 points. Eastern is 4-0 in the Big Sky. Cougars Win Third Straight Game With 45-42 Victory at Arizona Luke Falk threw for five touchdowns and 514 yards as WSU beat Arizona 45-42. For the first time since 2003, the Washington State football team has a three-game winning streak in conference play. Luke Falk threw for 514 yards and five touchdowns as WSU beat Arizona 45-42 Saturday. Gabe Marks caught four of those touchdown passes from Falk, setting a new school record for most touchdown receptions in a game.
