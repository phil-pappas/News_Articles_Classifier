The classification breakdown in all sports will be released in mid-November. \nSchools then have a month to choose the option of playing up in classification. In mid-December, the PIAA will release the breakdown of schools for each classification. Meetings to determine playoff brackets are scheduled for January and March, with a likely finalization in May. \nAmong area schools, North Penn (current enrollment number of 1,861), Pennsbury (1,385), Upper Darby (1,354), and Northeast (1,341) will be near the top of the largest classification. \nSchools that are on the bubble when it comes to being slotted in Class or for football include Cheltenham (608), Penn Wood (607), Hatboro-Horsham (605), and Plymouth Whitemarsh (597). \n\"I'm hearing we're going to be a 5A school,\" Plymouth Whitemarsh coach Dan Chang. \"If we're in 6A, that's a world of difference.\" \nA potential problem for some Class squads, in their bid to gain enough points to qualify for the postseason, is playing multiple smaller-classification league foes. For example, Spring-Ford and Perkiomen Valley are likely to face four AAAA opponents in the Pioneer Athletic Conference. \n\"That doesn't seem good for anyone,\" Downingtown East coach Mike Matta said. \"It really puts you in kind of a bind. I'd like to see the possible reformation of certain leagues be discussed.\" \nNo matter how the pie is sliced, a team near the bottom of a classification is going to face an uphill playoff battle. \nWhile there is a continued - and understandable - outcry for separate tournaments for public and private schools, Lombardi says it's not a topic for discussion. Not now and maybe never. \n\"It's not on the table,\" Lombardi said matter-of-factly. \"Private schools were included in the PIAA as an act of the state legislature in 1972. We're not going against that ruling. We want inclusion, not segregation.\" \nAnd what about the grumbling when it comes to alleged widespread recruiting by private schools? \n\"If someone wants to say that a school is violating the rules, there's a process in place,\" Lombardi said. \"We have committees, hearings, and an appeals board for that. You just have to follow the process.\" \nNo system is perfect. But give this one, which can be tweaked in two years, a chance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:34:12.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
