That's an ambitious goal, given the severity of his injury as originally diagnosed Sept. 20. But at least he's forcing the Bears' medical staff to consider it while backup Jimmy Clausen prepares to start his second straight game.\nCutler threw to receivers for the second straight day during the segment of practice open to media. However, the checklist to clear him is more extensive than that.\nHis mobility and, more specifically, his ability to protect himself are at issue.\n\"If you come back on a hamstring earlier than you want to, it's definitely in the back of your mind because there's that slight pull,\" he said. \"It's an instinctual game, so you're doing things on the run without thinking. To have to worry about a hamstring and moving around is something that could weigh on you.\"\nAs it stands, the decision on his status appears increasingly likely to come down to Sunday morning, when the Bears also must take into account the probability starting left tackle Jermon Bushrod (shoulder, concussion) will miss the game.\nBear Download: Quarterback outlook The Tribune's Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell discuss the Bears' quarterback situation.\nThe Tribune's Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell discuss the Bears' quarterback situation.\nSee more videos In the meantime, with Cutler and Clausen splitting practice reps, the Bears are searching for answers in their passing game, regardless of who's operating it.\nClausen completed 9 of 17 throws for only 63 yards against the Seahawks. The Bears publicly graded him on a curve because of Seattle's vaunted defense, the hostile crowd at CenturyLink Field and the absence of injured top receiver Alshon Jeffery, who might miss his third straight game this week.\nOffensive coordinator Adam Gase wanted to pound the Seahawks with the run and avoid an aerial shootout, which he feared would jeopardize ball security.\n\"The one regret I do have,\" Gase said, \"is in that second half I wish I would have pulled the trigger maybe a little bit sooner as far as being more aggressive on some of those first- and second-down calls.\"\nThe Bears could open up the playbook against a Raiders defense that ranks 30th in the NFL in passing yards per game. Safety Nate Allen suffered a knee injury in Week 1 that landed him on short-term injured reserve and caused some personnel shuffling in the secondary.\nSecond-year cornerback T.J. Carrie played safety last week for the first time, but veteran star safety Charles Woodson did have an interception in their victory over the Browns.\n\"With Charles back there, great player, gets to the ball very well,\" Clausen said. \"He knows concepts and routes, so he knows where everything's going to be. And they have a good pass rush. Those guys make plays back there.\"\nIt's matchup Cutler is pining to face. He was said to be very emotional in the locker room after leaving the Week 2 loss to Cardinals in the second quarter.\n\"We were figuring it out on offense,\" he said Thursday. \"We were starting to click a little bit.\"\nAs part of Cutler's recovery, he's using the Accelerated Recovery Performance (ARP) machine that has helped his reputation as a quick healer.\nAfter straining his groin against the Redskins in 2013, he credited the electrical stimulation apparatus with aiding his return to game action in three weeks despite a four-week prognosis for recovery.\nBut will it be enough for this Sunday?\n\"If it happens and I can get back, I can get back,\" Cutler said. \"Jimmy's 100 percent prepared and ready to go right now. We'll see how it goes.\"\nrcampbell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @Rich_Campbell\nPrivacy Policy Jay Cutler Oakland Raiders Adam Gase Seattle Seahawks Charles Woodson Chicago Bears Washington Redskins", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d859d/turbine/ct-jay-cutler-strained-hamstring-20151001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560e1561/turbine/ct-bears-download-quarterback-outlook-video-spt-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:58:16.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
