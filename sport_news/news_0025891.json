The Moga district in Malwa belt alone witnessed 21 blockades, it is learnt. The situation was no different in neighbouring Faridkot—the protests started from Bargai village in the district. Instead of softening their stance, the protesters today adopted a fresh strategy: an ‘Akhand’ path alongside protests at several places. The religious move, which has left authorities at the highest level in the state concerned, was initiated to restrain the police from acting tough on the protesters, said a participant. A religious leader, Panthpreet Singh, was booed by the audience in Faridkot when he appealed for rescheduling the agitation. In Moga, protesters were seen forcing traders to shut their shops. Akali leaders had to face trouble as protesters blocked their way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:17:57.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
