We need a bit more ruthlessness from everyone. \n\"Moving forward there are encouraging signs. Everyone is warming to the manager and how he wants to play. \n\"There's lots of hard work and lots of yards to put in to get to where we want to be. \n\"Jurgen has made it clear that he demands 100 per cent. He wants us to win the ball back as soon as it's given away. \n\"Going forward, it's going to improve.\" \nLallana's former club are next up at Anfield and will pose a more significant test than the 10-man Russians did. \n\"They are playing well at the minute and recruited well,\" said Lallana. \n\"I'm looking forward to meeting up with a few old friends but Sunday is about getting the business done and ensuring we get the three points. \n\"It's back to the training ground for us on Friday and we want nothing less than three points on Sunday.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:13:46.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
