But at the halfway point, and coming off a second-defining win over Oklahoma, the Longhorns have momentum heading into the final six games. \nTexas plays Kansas State next Saturday at home just a week after the same Sooners team that Texas beat laid out the K-State Wildcats 55-0. The Wildcats have the worst offense in the Big XII, averaging just 326.7 yards per game. The Wildcats are also averaging just 30 points per game, but have given up at least 33 points in their last four games, three of which were losses. \nThe Longhorns follow up the K-State game with a road contest with the Iowa State Cyclones. Iowa State ranks eighth in the Big XII in scoring and has been outscored 111-52 in their last two games. The Cyclones are also giving up 462 yards per game along with 32 points per game. Iowa State also has to play the offensive juggernaut of Baylor just a week before playing Texas. \nTexas then gets the worst team in the Big XII Conference, the Kansas Jayhawks at home in Austin. Kansas has yet to win a game this season and has only been competitive in two games, one against South Dakota State and the Jayhawks’ most recent loss to Texas Tech. \nKansas has to play both Oklahoma State and Oklahoma before they come to Darrell K. Royal Stadium to battle Texas. \nWest Virginia would be next on the schedule and has lost three in a row heading into their next game against fourth-ranked TCU. West Virginia’s defense has also given up 44, 33, and 62 points during their current losing streak. \nTexas then returns home to face Texas Tech, who can put up points in bunches, but has a hard time stopping anyone. The Red Raiders are one of the highest scoring teams in the nation, having scored at least 50 points in four of their first seven games. The Red Raiders’ trip to Austin will be the final game for Texas Tech of the season. \nThe Longhorns then close the season with a likely loss against Baylor. The Bears are scoring 63.8 points per game this season, tops in the nation. However, the Bears haven’t played a top team up to this point in the season. \nTexas may catch a break with Baylor as the Bears will be facing TCU just one week before the Longhorns game. Baylor will face Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, and TCU before playing Texas.
