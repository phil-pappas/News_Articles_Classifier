(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Do yourself a favor after this football season. Call Ash Grove High School and ask for the season-highlight DVD, and then fast-forward to the chapter (because it’ll need to be a chapter by itself) on Jackson Bagley. Check out the senior quarterback’s Friday night, especially his monster second half: A 33-yard run on fourth down to set up the tying touchdown. A last-minute option pitch to a running back for said tying touchdown, much like those old 1980s, wishbone-running Oklahoma Sooners. Zig-zag scrambles all around, including an underhand pass to avoid a sack, another scramble before a key pass that led to the go-ahead TD. And then there was the 46-yarder on third down minutes before his first field goal of the season. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS He did everything but run the concession stand, or so it seemed.“I don’t know how to explain it. We were all pumped up walking down here (after halftime),” Bagley said, stressing a team effort and downplaying his performance that sparked Ash Grove to a come-from-behind, 17-7 victory against the host Fair Grove Eagles. Make no mistake, said his own coach and the opposing coach. Friday, they concurred, belonged to Bagley, he of the 28-carry, 143-yard rushing effort – including 20 carries and 119 yards after halftime.“He put us on his back,” said Ash Grove coach Ryan Jones. Said Fair Grove coach Bill Voorhis, “They’ve got a special player over there in Jackson Bagley. He just kind of took it over, and we didn’t respond.” With all eyes on the Mid-Lakes Conference showdown between Skyline and Marionville, Bagley’s performance suggested Ash Grove could quietly be a factor in the next few weeks. The Pirates (6-3, 3-3 Mid-Lakes) clearly played with a sense of urgency, and Bagley emphasized that it was because of the coaching staff’s halftime adjustments. Likewise, he credited his zig-zags and other crazy plays – at least allowing time for the plays to develop – on an offensive line of Max Cashio, Cole Davis, Trenton Climer, Keegan Hosman and Josh Pipkin. Everything was “we” out of Bagley’s mouth.“This is basically a new start for us. A lot of times we’re not chosen to have the upper hand,” Bagley said. “But it’s a huge confidence-booster for us.” One could have made a case for Fair Grove as the favorite entering Friday, given the Eagles ended a losing streak to Strafford last month and then last week nearly threw an upset on Class 1’s No. 2-ranked Marionville before losing 22-20. Fair Grove did assert itself early with a Dalton Cloyd 8-yard touchdown run late in the first quarter. However, Ash Grove’s defense held steady the rest of the way, allowing the Pirates’ offense to find its legs after halftime. Bagley’s last-minute pitch to Spencer Eagleburger for a 7-yard tying TD came a play after the quarterback’s 33-yard run on fourth-and-3 from the 40 – which was one play after Bagley’s scramble left, then right gained a critical 10 yards. Call it the momentum-builder Ash Grove needed. The Pirates forced a three-and-out, and then took its next drive 48 yards covering 10 plays – with a smorgasbord of highlights. The drive ended when Bagley scored on a 5-yard run. At that point, it was 14-7 with 43 seconds left in the third quarter.“That’s what Bagley does best,” said Pipkin, a tight end who moved to both guard spots recently. “He makes a play when there is no play to be had.” Fair Grove fumbled on its next possession as it tried a little-used quarterback on second-and-8 at the Ash Grove 41. Bagley made it hurt. He directed the next drive from the Pirates 35 to the Fair Grove 11 before kicking a 27-yard field goal. His 46-yarder on third-and-3 from the 42 all but cemented his grip on Friday night’s spotlight.“We came out on fire. We knew we had a lot left in us,” Jones said of the second half. “We’re big on wearing teams down, and we play hard the whole game. I told the kids if we keep hitting them, keep hitting them, we’ll wear them down. And I can’t ask enough of Jackson Bagley.” Ash Grove also forced a fumble and intercepted two passes, with Chase White’s INT all but preserving the victory. White’s oskie came one play after Fair Grove’s successful hook-and-ladder – the catch from Steven Huskey, the sweep toss to Cloyd and, a wrinkle, an option pitch to Austin Fodge – gained 28 yards. It took the Eagles to the Ash Grove 24 with about 2 minutes left, but White denied a late rally. Afterward, Voorhis acknowledged that the loss was a learning experience for his Fair Grove program, which has made strides in three years but is still learning how to win.“They were tougher than we were, and you could tell getting that fifth win was important to them,” Voorhis said, and later added, “We’ve played well enough to have a winning season, which is something our seniors have never had.“We talked this week about how hard to get over the hump. A football season is supposed to be 13, 14, 15 weeks long, not just 10 and turn in your gear. I don’t think our kids are ready to do that. I’m just think we’re at the doorstep and sometimes that last step is the toughest.” Ash Grove 17, Fair Grove 7 Ash Grove 0 0 14 3 – 17 Fair Grove 7 0 0 0 – 0 First quarter FG – Dalton Cloyd 8 run (Anthony Guynn kick) Third quarter AG – Spencer Eagleburger 7 run (Jackson Bagley kick) AG – Bagley 5 run (Bagley kick) Fourth quarter AG – Field Goal, 22, Bagley Team statistics First downs: Ash Grove 11, Fair Grove 10 Rushes-yards: Ash Grove 39-191, Fair Grove 39-146 Passing yards: Ash Grove 19, Fair Grove 82 Comp-att-int: Ash Grove 4-8-1, Fair Grove 8-12-1 Fumbles-lost: Ash Grove 1-0, Fair Grove 2-2 Penalties: Ash Grove 6-40, Fair Grove 2-10 Punts-avg.: Ash Grove 4-34.5, Fair Grove 5-27 Individual statistics Rushing – Ash Grove: Bagley 28-143, Eagleburger 5-36, Soper 5-13; Fair Grove: Fodge 13-73, Cloyd 11-44, Huskey 3-3, Lumley 11-26, Sandridge 1-0.
