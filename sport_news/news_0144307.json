It's also green and that's exciting. \nNot much else to say, really. \nUntil football is brought into the mix. \nPerhaps more than any other sport, football was made for grass. Factors such as ball security, grip, balance and strategy become heightened when playing on grass. All of the above are important anywhere but to a lesser extent on turf. \nThrow in elements such as wind, rain or snow, and the degree of difficulty becomes even more magnified on grass, especially for quarterbacks, centers and kickers. \nAs a huge fan of NFL Films growing up, watching the Bears' Gayle Sayres make amazing cuts on mud-caked fields or the Packers' Jim Taylor powering through defenders in harsh conditions at Lambeau Field ... well, that's the essence of football. \nIt's not the same on artificial turf. \nOK, I'll plead guilty to sounding like the old man yelling at kids to get off the lawn. \nStill, we have entirely too many turf fields in the Section 4 Football Conference. Stop, please stop, with all of these newfangled, state-of-the-art palaces. These are high school facilities in upstate New York, not some Donald Trump creation that needs the best of this or the best of that at every step of the construction. \nWent to Sidney last season for the football opener on its new turf field and there stood a huge video screen on the scoreboard. Isn't all of this going just a touch overboard? \nThe best high school games I've covered have come on grass. \nThere were a pair of games between Windsor and Walton in 1993, a 1994 game between Chenango Forks and Chenango Valley (the last time CV beat the Blue Devils), a 1997 Class B sectional final that pitted Windsor against Oneonta, and a pair of Delhi-Walton nail-biters in the 2000 season (for the record, I've seen some good ones on turf as well). Never once felt cheated that they played those games â€“ some in awful conditions -- on grass. \nHad the pleasure of seeing a good mud game this past Saturday at Chenango Valley. The Warriors went old-school on Waverly in a 22-12 victory, with a misty rain and breezy conditions adding to the setting. \nIt says here that CV doesn't win that game on carpet. Waverly quarterback Peyton Miller would have had an easier time getting the ball to his receivers if the footing was better and some of those wayward shotgun snaps probably wouldn't have happened. \n\"We were good mudders,\" said CV coach Jay Hope, whose team ran it 50 times Saturday. \nThey won't be good mudders next season, at least not at home. CV will play on a new turf field next season. \nThere are probably a million things I'm not considering in my criticism of turf fields, but football was never meant to be played in pristine conditions. Adapting to field conditions should be part of the game. \nNow get off my lawn! \nCentorani can be reached at rcentorani@pressconnects.com and follow him on twitter at @PSBRob. 2 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1LktiSx TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:40:45.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
