Meanwhile, Grand easily won the team competition.\nMore Coverage Red Devils off to hot start in 2A boys golf state championship “ I was a little stressed out in the playoff but I guess it all worked out. It was kind of nerve-racking.”\nGarrett Furubayashi\nMIDWAY — Rowland Hall senior Garrett Furubayashi stayed calm during a sudden-death playoff for medalist honors at the 2A boys golf state championship. Well, calmer than in previous years at least.\nFurubayashi was clearly feeling some pressure on the 18th hole of Soldier Hollow's silver course during his playoff with Manti’s Davis Hardy. However, he was able to overcome the nerves and win the individual portion of the 2A championship, defeating Hardy on the second playoff hole. Joining him in the winner’s circle was Grand High, which shot a 616 two-day total to win the team portion of the event.\n“It feels really good,” Grand coach Aaron Woodard said. “The kids really wanted it.”\nLed by sophomore Masen Ward, who shot a two-day total of 150, the Red Devils easily took home the team trophy, beating second-place South Sevier by 15 shots. Grand also received contributions from Brendon Woodard, Alec Williams and Brayden Ward. Rounding out Grand’s squad were Kane Scherer and Tobin Wainer.\n“The kids themselves are the ones who wanted it and they practiced so hard for it and they went after it and got it,” Woodard said. “It’s all on the kids.”\nIt was Furubayashi and Davis who stole the show when they went to their sudden-death playoff. Furubayashi, who shot a 75 on Day 1, improved on Thursday by shooting a 72. Hardy, who shot 78 on Wednesday, made a huge improvement to take Furubayashi to a playoff as he shot 69 on Thursday.\nIn the playoff, they took to No. 18 on the silver course, where they each made par the first time around. On their second try on No. 18, Furubayashi stroked a hybrid right down the middle of the fairway. Hardy, meanwhile, found a fairway bunker.\nFurubayashi hit his second shot about 50 yards in from of the green, while Hardy was only able to advance about 20 from the bunker.\nHardy hit up by the green and found the green in four shots, putting the pressure on Furubayashi, who hit his approach shot to the fringe in front of the green. However, in the big moment, the Rowland Hall senior was calm enough to chip his shot to about 5 feet away.\nHardy missed his 15-footer while Furubayashi made his putt, giving him his first individual state title.\n“I was a little stressed out in the playoff but I guess it all worked out,” Furubayashi said. “It was kind of nerve-racking.”\nRowland Hall coach Stacey Camacho has been with Furubayashi since he was a freshman and Camacho has noticed the improvement in the now senior's game.\n“We started working together when he was a freshman and all the hours he has put in to make this happen are countless,” Camacho said. “He was there in the wintertime, when it was 100 degrees outside, when it was raining.”\nBehind Furubayashi and Hardy came Grand’s Ward and Woodard at third and fourth place, respectively.\nSouth Sevier, which was tied for fourth place after Wednesday, shot a 305 team total on Thursday to swoop in and take second in the team competition.\nTEAM SCORES\n1 Grand, 616; 2.
