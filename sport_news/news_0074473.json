Then rough weather moved in and slowed fishing for the weekend. Fishermen have caught good-sized fish from boats in the Vegas Wash area. Lures still are working for top-water action, while anchovies fished on the bottom are catching catfish.\nLAKE MOHAVE — Striped bass action remains good in coves north of the power lines. Smallmouth bass can be found along the shelves, and pan fish are providing good action for bank fishermen using night crawlers.\nLAUGHLIN — Fishing along the Colorado River has slowed, but anglers still are finding striper action along Casino Row. Channel catfish have been found along the banks.\nLAS VEGAS URBAN PONDS — Fishing action was slow this past week due to thunderstorm activity around the valley. Warm-water fish, such as largemouth bass and bluegill, still are taking mealworms and night crawlers, but cooling water temperatures have slowed things a bit.\nKIRCH WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA — Fishing has been tough. Aquatic vegetation around the boat launches and along the dams still is a problem, and recent thunderstorm activity has limited fishing activity. Fall temperatures should help with both of these issues. Duck hunters might want to bring their fishing rods as well as their shotguns.\nEAGLE VALLEY RESERVOIR — Rain, rain and more rain was the situation at the park over the weekend. Anglers braving the lake between storm cells fared well using PowerBait and night crawlers. Water conditions are murky following all the rain, but that also means water levels are rising.\nECHO CANYON RESERVOIR — Rain was the name of the game over the weekend. While the precipitation is helping to raise water levels, it is making the reservoir murky. Trout action has been good. The fish are taking PowerBait, night crawlers and small spinning lures.\nDodgers, Mattingly mutually... Horse Racing: Today at...
