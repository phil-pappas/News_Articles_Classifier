The NFL Network report states as of Saturday night, doctors were attempting to fight off further infection and working to save his foot, which is at risk.\nThe problem arose after Fells had a toe injury, followed by an ankle injury and was treated with a cortisone shot. A week later, on Oct. 2, Fells’ wife took him to the emergency room with a 104-degree temperature. It was determined that his ankle was infected with MRSA, a staph infection that is dangerous because it is resistant to many antibiotics.\nThe NFL Network report states doctors are hoping to avoid amputating the foot, but the more urgent fear is MRSA has spread into the bone and could travel into the blood, which could be fatal.\nFells, 32, is an eight-year NFL veteran who has played for the Falcons, Rams, Broncos and Patriots before signing in 2014 with the Giants.\nBased on a directive from the NFL and the NFL Players Association, the Giants had a briefing with their players on Wednesday morning about what the team is doing to ensure their safety after Fells had to be hospitalized. Team physicians, senior vice president of medical services Ronnie Barnes and the supervisor in charge of cleaning the team facility offered an update on what is being done to prevent the spread of the staph infection. The entire facility, including the locker room, meeting rooms and trainers’ room, was scrubbed, and players were alerted to watch for any warning signs that their health might be compromised.\n“We are concerned about Daniel Fells, we’re very concerned about that,’’ Coughlin said last week. “We still do not know the reason for the infection or where it came from.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under daniel fells ,  new york giants", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:30:23.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
