Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 8:35 PM UTICA Thursday was a big day for 7-year-old Jack Elia. Standing in the concourse of the Utica Memorial Auditorium, Jack patiently waited in line as he approached his favorite Utica Comets player, Hunter Shinkaruk, to score an autograph. “I really like when they score and the alarm goes off,” the Clinton resident said, squirming with excitement. “I jump up and down!” The season begins Saturday in Rochester and the first home game is Oct. 21. Jack hopes to go to every game this year, because he and his family are season ticket holders — and so were the thousands of other fans at the Aud for the Season Ticket Holder party. Lines of fans sprawled around the Auditorium leading toward Comets players who signed photographs and took pictures with their supporters.

Matt Potrzcba, who works for the team, demoed a new system ticket holders will be using this season. Beginning Saturday, those who have tickets for the season can visit EmpireStateTix.com to transfer tickets to a friend if they can’t make a game. “It’s very simple,” he said. “Very user friendly. You just click on your account where you can view each of the games this season, and plug in your friend’s email to send to them.” Valerie Bouchard, 3, posed with players Cole Cassels, Brendan Gaunce and Travis Ehrhardt. “She loves hockey,” her mom Ruth Bouchard said. “Tell her what you say during the games, honey.” “U-TI-CA,” Valerie squeaked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:58:21.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
