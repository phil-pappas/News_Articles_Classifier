He was hurt on a carry deep in Chicago territory, as he was cutting left at the line.\nHe immediately grabbed his right knee - Charles tore the ACL in his left knee in 2012 - and was helped straight to the locker room by a trainer and teammate Justin Houston.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and the Associated Press.
