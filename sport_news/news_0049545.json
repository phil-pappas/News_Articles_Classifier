The Browns made Manziel active for last week’s game against Denver despite his domestic incident. \nManziel admitted drinking alcohol before his argument with girlfriend Colleen Crowley. He spent 10 weeks in a rehab facility during the offseason. Manziel told police he did not strike Crowley. \n___= \nOnline: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:04:32.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
