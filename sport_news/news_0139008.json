As far as the offseason goes, this is one of the oddest in recent memory for the NHL. The amount of off-ice problems this summer isn’t necessarily typical, but the severity has opened the eyes of many around North America.\nAdChoices The player that immediately comes to the forefront for his off-ice issues this year is Patrick Kane. Recently, the NHL and Chicago Blackhawks believed that it would be a prudent decision to allow Kane to participate in preseason games — a move that would seemingly be against the precedent they set with Slava Voynov. The NHL ruled quickly that he wouldn’t be allowed to play after domestic violence charges were brought up against Voynov.\nWhat makes the Kane situation different?\nNothing, really.\nAs a serious charge has been leveled against Kane, the league has decided to double down and allow him to play. The Blackhawks in their infinite wisdom are actually going to be having a Patrick Kane bobblehead night in January. No, seriously, they are actually having it. Just how tone-deaf can one organization be? Not only is this an ongoing investigation for a sexually violent crime, but it also is terrible PR for an organization that should be deflecting attention away from itself.\nFor a league that isn’t particularly popular, you would think that the decent and just move would be to suspend Kane until the situation resolves itself, but the Blackhawks and NHL have made it abundantly clear that they would rather lose fans than do the right thing.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:41:34.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
