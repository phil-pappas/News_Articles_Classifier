The Red Raiders (5-0, 1-0) went to the air on offense and used a smothering defense to stay unbeaten.\n\"Unbelievable win,\" said quarterback Anthony Binetti, who passed for 239 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score. \"We're excited we did our jobs and physically beat them. We knew this was going to be our year.\"\nHuntley took an 8-0 lead less than 5 minutes into the first quarter on a 42-yard pass from Binetti to Eric Mooney.\nCary-Grove (4-1, 0-1) had yet to allow more than 15 points in a game.\n\"It shows that our offense has a lot of talent,\" Mooney said. \"We're hard to stop.\"\nThe Red Raiders moved the ball again early in the second quarter as Binetti and Mooney hooked up for a 40-yard gain to the Trojans' 6. Casey Haayer then ran to the goal line before fumbling into the end zone, but Timothy McCloyn recovered the ball for another Huntley score with 8:19 left in the second quarter to make it 15-0.\nHuntley's defense made big stops all night. Led by Caleb Jones and McCloyn, the Red Raiders ended two drives deep in Huntley territory and forced a fumble.\nPrep football: No. 19 Simeon gets it together, defeats Curie Steve Reaven Tactics didn't cause Simeon to come back from a two-touchdown halftime deficit against Curie on Friday at Gately Stadium.\nAccording to the No. 19 Wolverines, coach Dante Culbreath's locker-room words were it took to turn the tide in their 33-21 CPS Red Bird win.\n\"He motivated us to play like we...\nTactics didn't cause Simeon to come back from a two-touchdown halftime deficit against Curie on Friday at Gately Stadium.\nAccording to the No. 19 Wolverines, coach Dante Culbreath's locker-room words were it took to turn the tide in their 33-21 CPS Red Bird win.\n\"He motivated us to play like we...\n(Steve Reaven) \"It's emotional,\" Jones said of the signature win. \"It's stunning.\"\nBinetti ran the ball in from 10 yards late in the third to cap a 90-yard drive to make it 22-0.
