The police department along with the sheriff's department set up sting operations over the weekend to catch businesses in the act, illegally selling alcohol to shoppers under the age of twenty one. Of the 16 businesses who sell alcohol in the city, a quarter were caught, issued a citation, and will have to appear before a judge.\n\"I'm not going to say all of them, but there are ones in town that usually, routinely fail when they go through. One of the businesses actually looked at the license and still sold. It could just depend on who's working for them, if they care about what they're doing or not,‚Äù says Corporal Dustin Whitehill of the Neosho Police Department.\nNewton County Sheriff Ken Copeland says half of the 24 stores checked in the county failed. The sheriff's office will be checking up on them again later in the year, and repeat offenders may be arrested.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:46:48.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
