Lincoln-Way West's 5-foot-10-inch, 170-pound senior tailback Gabe Montalvo led the Warriors past Bradley-Bourbonnais, 28-18, Friday in a crucial SouthWest Suburban Red battle. Related Links Minooka football stumbles at Oswego East, falls 17-8 \nMontalvo ran through the Boilermaker defense for 222 yards on 34 carries. He scored his 21st and 22nd touchdowns in the first half and has now rushed for 1,380 yards this season. \nThe Warrior defense was led by defensive lineman Deven Reed, who had 14 tackles and three sacks. Junior linebacker Trey Telez added a sack and defensive backs Josh Bohne and Cam Gavin had interceptions in the second quarter. Gavin's pick came in the end zone. \nIn the first quarter, Joey Velasquez recovered a Boilermaker punt return at the Bradley 32-yard line. On the next play Montalvo raced 32 yards for the first Warrior score. \nWarrior quarterback Connor Lowman (11-for-16 passing, two touchdowns) hit fullback Tom LaBerry (four catches, 29 yards, touchdown) from 5 yards out to give the Warriors a 21-10 lead with 1:34 left in the third quarter. Bradley-Bourbonnais (5-3, 3-3) scared the Warrior faithful, when they scored with 2:24 left in the game on a 15-yard pass from quarterback Austin Plowni to receiver Will Conway and the subsequent two-point conversion brought the score to 21-18. \nAn illegal kick on the first Bradley on-side kick attempt led to a 5-yard penalty and then on the second attempt, it appeared the Boilermakers had recovered. An illegal touching penalty on B-B, before the ball went 10 yards, gave the Warriors the ball at the Bradley 32. Four Montalvo runs and a 7-yard Lowman touchdown strike to tight end Ben Zordani (five catches, 30 yards, touchdown) with 18 second left ended the contest. \nLincoln-Way West (7-1, 5-1), closes out the 2015 regular season Friday at undefeated arch-rival Lincoln-Way North. A Warrior win will give West a share of the 2015 Southwest Suburban Red championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:11:11.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
