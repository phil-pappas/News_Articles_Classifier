They want their patients to know that back pain in children and teenagers is uncommon, but when it does occur, it should be dealt with quickly. These blogs can be found here:\n Sports-Related Lower Back Pain in Children and Teenagers Lower Back Pain from School Sports Activities How Concussions Affect School Performance\nThe first blog discusses how back pain occurs most often in adults due to the fact that children and teenagers are more flexible and resilient. For this reason, the chiropractors say they do not often suffer the same types of back injuries. As a matter of fact, they say children rarely suffer from pain in their backs. When children complain about chronic or acute back pain, it should be taken seriously by their pediatricians and parents.\nThe blog also discusses the procedures a child or teen will go through if the back pain is deemed serious. The first step is often a detailed consultation that may include a physical exam and a review of medical history. Further, medical professionals may request that radiological studies, including x-rays or MRI scans be necessary if pain episodes continue. The results of these tests may lead to the child or teen being referred to a specialist for more in depth examination and testing.\nThe second blog post discusses the types of injuries a child or teenager can get when they participate in school sports. Spondylolysis is a condition that occurs as school related sporting events become more competitive. These activities are more specialized and some back injuries can arise. This condition is a joint defect between vertebral bones and is found mostly in older teenagers when their backs are hyperextended in sports like gymnastics.\nThe blog also covers spondylolisthesis, which is a condition where there is a “slipping” of vertebra. This condition can last from early adolescence to later years and get progressively worse over time. When this leads to back instability and pain, surgery may be necessary.\nA Family and Sports Chiropractic Clinic goes on to describe the types of disc injuries and vertebral fractures that can occur. They say, “Teens who are hard on their spines through gymnastics or school sports may land hard on their feet or buttocks. This force is transmitted to the vertebrae, which can result in a vertebral fracture or damage to the intervertebral discs.”\nThe last blog in the series introduces the results of a new study that has shown that brain rest is extremely important for children in school following a concussion. The study was from Pediatrics and it surveyed 349 students between the ages of 5 and 18 who had a concussion within the past 4 weeks. Their parents were also surveyed. They were asked questions about the child’s functioning following the concussion. Children were also given several memory and concentration tests, and the results were categorized based on lingering symptoms. This study introduced in the blog post showed that 88% of the children who had not yet recovered reported symptoms like trouble concentrating, headaches, fatigue, and academic struggles.\nA Family and Sports Chiropractic Clinic wants parents to know that it is important to consider chiropractic care for their children who participate in sports . They recently said “With school sporting season upon us, it is a great idea for parents to get their children's backs checked by a chiropractor to help with their season.”", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZmFtaWx5c3BvcnRzY2hpcm9wcmFjdGljLmNvbS9jaGlyb3ByYWN0aWMtc2VydmljZXMv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZmFtaWx5c3BvcnRzY2hpcm9wcmFjdGljLmNvbS8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZmFtaWx5c3BvcnRzY2hpcm9wcmFjdGljLmNvbS9jaGlyb3ByYWN0aWMtc2VydmljZXMvc3BvcnRzLWNoaXJvcHJhY3Rvci8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZmFtaWx5c3BvcnRzY2hpcm9wcmFjdGljLmNvbS95b3VyLXZhbmNvdXZlci13YS1jaGlyb3ByYWN0b3ItZGlzY3Vzc2VzLWxvd2VyLWJhY2stcGFpbi1pbi1jaGlsZHJlbi1hbmQtdGVlbnMtcmVzdWx0aW5nLWZyb20tc3BvcnRzLWFjdGl2aXRpZXMv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZmFtaWx5c3BvcnRzY2hpcm9wcmFjdGljLmNvbS9hLXZhbmNvdXZlci13YS1jaGlyb3ByYWN0b3ItZGlzY3Vzc2VzLXNwb3J0cy1yZWxhdGVkLWxvd2VyLWJhY2stcGFpbi1pbi1raWRzLWFuZC10ZWVuYWdlcnMv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZmFtaWx5c3BvcnRzY2hpcm9wcmFjdGljLmNvbS9hLXZhbmNvdXZlci1jaGlyb3ByYWN0b3ItZGlzY3Vzc2VzLWhvdy1jb25jdXNzaW9ucy1hZmZlY3Qtc2Nob29sLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZmFtaWx5c3BvcnRzY2hpcm9wcmFjdGljLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9ibG9nLw=="], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:33:27.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
