Four of those touchdowns were caught by wide receiver Adam Geiger. While both believed they could have a great game, neither saw that coming. \n\"Homecoming week,\" Geiger says. \"We were all pretty pumped before the game, especially knowing Dalton was coming back and starting so I think we were just a little more ready to go than normal.\" \nFeeney says, \"I think it's just maybe him getting off quarterback and being wide receiver. That's his position and I've been throwing to him probably ever since fourth grade so I think it just came back and decided that night, we were gonna go off.\" \nFeeney and Geiger are best friends off the field. A relationship that allows them to communicate openly when the game is on the line. \n\"We talk throughout the game of what route he's gonna be open in,\" says Feeney. \"We kinda just critique each other sometimes. Sometimes I'm like 'you gotta run that corner more in depth' and he's probably like 'well, you gotta lead me a little bit more.' I mean, we're friends off and on the field. It's just awesome having him back.\" \n\"We even play catch like when it's not during the season so he always knows where I'm gonna be no matter if he's been out or whatever,\" Geiger says. \"He just knows where I'm gonna be usually when he throws me the ball.\" \nAnd with Feeney back under center and Geiger back in his natural position of wide receiver, they believe they are a completely different team. \nFeeney says, \"Teams are gonna have to be worried about two wide receivers having Sweep and Adam out there instead of just double teaming Sweep. But, Mike Olsen, our wide receivers are stepping up to the plate now because we're so in depth with our wide receivers having Adam back and having Logan Gross back at running back... We're gonna be a tough team.\" \nThe Patriots are going to have to use all of that depth to secure a playoff spot. Right now, they're tied for fourth with Mandan and Williston. All three of them are 2-2 in the conference.
