He remained on the ground as he was attended to by Mets medical staff before he was carted off the field.\nAfter the game Mets manager Terry Collins refrained from criticizing Utley for his hard slide, but did say his players were angered by the play.\n\"It broke my shortstop’s leg, that’s all I know,\" said Collins, who then was asked if he felt Utley's slide was dirty.\n\"I'm not going to get into it. It’s over and done.\"\nCollins will replace Tejada in the lineup with infielder Wilmer Flores.\nThe third game of the series is back in New York on Monday.\n(Reporting by Tim Wharnsby; editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:37:37.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
