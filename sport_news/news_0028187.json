Hunt placed 10th in 21:11.57 to lead the Chieftains to second place in the Black Division girls team standings. \nBy SCOTT COTTOS STAFF WRITER FOSTORIA — While nasty weather has always seemed to be the norm for the Fostoria Athletic Boosters Cross Country Invitational, pleasant conditions greeted the meet on Saturday at Fostoria Junior/Senior High School. It was particularly pleasant for Carey’s boys team. The Division III, 11th-ranked Blue Devils turned in a strong performance while finishing second to No. 5 Liberty Center by a 49-60 margin in Black Division competition. Junior Trevor Cook led Carey by finishing second in 16:15.67, trailing only Liberty Center’s Colin Burns, who crossed the finish line in 16:13.59.“We’ve been trying very hard to all have our best race on the same day and it looks like we may have done it today,” Blue Devils coach Dean Kessler said. “We’ve been chasing it all year long. We really hadn’t done it, where everybody had their best race on the same day. Today looked good. I’m very pleased.” Sophomores Jack Yeater (17:23.53) and Tyler Leist (17:26.32) finished seventh and eighth, respectively, in support of Cook’s effort. Cook said he and Burns exchanged the lead several times during the race before the Liberty Center senior took the lead for good near the end.“He was coasting off me for about the last 800 to a mile,” Cook said. “He took (the lead) on this last straightaway. He got me, but he was definitely worried. I’m not too ashamed of coming in second behind an elite runner like he is.” Ayersville was third with 115 points, followed by Old Fort (159), St. Wendelin (177) and Hopewell-Loudon (189). St. Wendelin lost ground in the team competition with coach Ethan Reinhart pulling his No. 3 runner, Dylan Sheets, off the course early in the race after seeing the freshman being troubled by a foot problem. Reinhart doesn’t believe Sheets’ injury is serious, but the coach was looking toward having him in good condition for next week’s Sandusky River League meet at Fremont’s Walsh Park.“We pulled Dylan and we let a couple of other guys pull up just to make sure we were staying healthy for next week,” Reinhart said. Nick DeHaven finished third for the Mohawks in 16;35.13. Hopewell-Loudon’s Garrett Hedrick was sixth in 17:16.81. Cole Manasian (18:02.55) and Mike Heilman (18:11.88) were 24th and 25th, respectively, for Old Fort. Natalie Hunt placed 10th in 21:11.57 to lead Hopewell-Loudon to second place in the Black Division girls team standings. Liberty Center, led by individual winner Olivia Kundo (19;24.52), topped the Chieftains 44-110 for the team title.“The times weren’t great,” Hopewell-Loudon coach Paul Jones said. “It didn’t seem like (the race) ran real fast, which was kind of surprising because the junior high race did. I think they competed, position-wise, real well, though.” Pettisville was third with 114, followed by Carey with 127. Destiny DeFeo led Carey with her fourth-place showing in 20:07.07. Huron claimed the Red Division girls team title by a 70-91 margin over Napoleon. Eastwood’s Hannah Sponaugle won the race in 19:21.67. Taylor Ellerbrock’s seventh-place finish in 20:25.77 led Columbus Grove to fourth in the team standings with 129 points, five behind third-place Bowling Green.“I went out pretty fast and I was glad I did because there was a big group of girls going out there,” Ellerbrock, a sophomore, said. “When I got ahead (of the pack) I felt I was in a pretty good position and just tried my best to hold my pace the rest of the way.” Division II 10th-ranked Otsego won the Red Division boys team title over No. 21 Bowling Green, 58-69. Columbus Grove, paced by 18th-place Boone Brubaker (17:51.77), was sixth with 183 points.
