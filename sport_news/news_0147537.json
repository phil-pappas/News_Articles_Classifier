The Yellow Jackets fell to Gulfport 28-10 last week.\nWayne Overman accounted for six scores in the win, as he threw for four touchdowns and ran for two more in the win.\nYellow Jacket Head Coach Eddie Whitehead said he liked the way his team reacted to adversity. \"We had to get back on track after the loss,\" Whitehead said. \"I think our defense stepped up and played well tonight.\"\nThe Yellow Jackets led 14-7 to start the second quarter, after Overman connected with Isaac Williams on a 43-yard touchdown toss and Overman scored on a two-yard run.\nSt. Martin quickly took control, scoring six touchdowns in the quarter.\nOverman threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Williams and Kalen Reddix raced in from 41 yards to extend the lead to 28-7. Overman then connected with Kaleb Clark for a magnificent 31-yard touchdown play in which Clark made a circus-like one-handed grab. Tyler Polk scored on a one-yard run and Polk later hauled in a 60-yard pass from Overman for another score.\nOverman capped the half with a 63-yard touchdown rumble with only seconds to play in the half, giving the Yellow Jackets a 56-7 advantage at the break.\nPolk led all receivers with 112 yards on five grabs. Williams added 76 yards on three catches.\nA two-yard run by Justin Clevenger in the third from ended the scoring for SMHS. Sean Gomez connected on all nine extra-point opportunities on the evening.\nThis story will be updated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:06:39.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
