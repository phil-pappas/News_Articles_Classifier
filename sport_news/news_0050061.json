We'll see.\"\nThe Cavaliers only have two preseason games left - at the Toronto Raptors on Sunday and home against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. Because they are meaningless games on a back-to-back, it's implausible James would play in both anyways. The Cavs open the regular season against the Chicago Bulls as part of the season-opening TNT doubleheader on Oct. 27.\nJames was sent home sick from Tuesday's preseason loss to the Milwaukee Bucks . It's no secret the Cavaliers intend to further regulate his minutes this season after a historic usage rate in last spring's playoffs. He turns 31 in December.\nCopyright © 2015 Score Media Ventures Inc. All rights reserved.
