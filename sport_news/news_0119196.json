He announced that Melvin Lewis will miss the remainder of the season with that fracture fibula. Stoops hopes his team can reach a bowl game to give the senior defensive tackle one last opportunity to wear the blue and white. \n“It’s usually a six-week injury,” said Stoops, hoping Lewis will return for a potential bowl game. “We’re not counting on him for the remainder of this regular season.” \nStoops expects Matt Elam to play well in place of Elam’s friend and mentor on the defensive line. \n“They are very tight, off the field as well. Matt really looks up to Melvin and he was disappointed for Melvin that he got hurt. But he will step in and do a good job.” Article written by Drew Franklin I can recite every line from Forrest Gump, blindfolded.

It’s your chance, big guy.

Mississippi State will blow the ball up the middle at will like Auburn did. Lewis played hard and never quit on a play. Real bummer.
