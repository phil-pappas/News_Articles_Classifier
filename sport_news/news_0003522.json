Filling in for the injured Jarrett Guarantano, Langan guided the Crusaders on a drive that led to the score-tying field goal at the end of regulation, and then made the pass that gave Bergen Catholic the win and at least a share of the Big North United Division title. \n“I think he’s awesome,” said Bergen Catholic coach Nunzio Campanile of Langan. \n“I think he’s an unbelievable winner and a great athlete and the moment is just not too big for him at all.” \nFacing third-and-9 in overtime, the play call was for receivers to go vertical and two others to cross underneath. \n“I was looking for a deep cross combination,” said Langan. “It wasn’t there, so then I surveyed the field and I saw Connor in the end zone and he was pretty much wide open.” \nLangan had time, but, before he released the pass, nearly tripped over a St. Joseph defensive lineman. He collected himself. \n“He just sat back there,” said Campanile. “He has a cannon and he kind of threw it off his back foot, but he ripped it in there.” \nHebbeler had only one other reception, a nice one-handed catch on a 7-yard gain in the second quarter. Until Saturday his contributions to the game had been negligible. \n“Connor is one of our everything guys,” said Campanile. “He’s a fullback, a tight end, a tackle, a defensive tackle, you name it, he does it. That’s what I think our team is all about, guys like Connor Hebbeler, people don’t talk about him all the time, but he’s a great player.” \nAnother hero for the Crusaders was freshman kicker Michael Kearney, who made a 22-yard field goal at the end of regulation. Campanile said his range was only 25 yards and in, and Kearney, a Mahwah resident, admitted to being nervous when he took the field. \n“You practice it a million times in practice, you keep going over it, but the first time you go out there, you’re scared,” said Kearney. \nWithout Guarantano, teams may not be quite as scared of the Crusaders as they used to be, but Bergen Catholic has just found ways to win. This is the third time in the last four years Bergen Catholic has beaten St. Joseph in overtime. \n“Coach said after Jarrett went down that we weren’t going to win every game by a lot,” said Langan. “Every game would come down to who worked hard that week and who is tougher.” \nSince the Big North United shifted to this five-team format in 2012, no team has gone undefeated in divisional play. Bergen Catholic faces Don Bosco next weekend in Ramsey. \n“I guess we will test that out,” said Campanile. “It’s the biggest game there is.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:05:10.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
