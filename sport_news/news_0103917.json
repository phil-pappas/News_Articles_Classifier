Chapman Stadium produced the most combined points in an FBS game this season. \nWhile NFL prospect Paxton Lynch lit up the Hurricane for 447 passing yards and accounted for five touchdowns, TU slinger Dane Evans threw for 421 yards and four touchdowns. \n\"I thought our guys played extremely hard,\" TU coach Philip Montgomery said. \"I think we had opportunities in there to really get back in the football game. I love the way they competed. \n\"Take nothing from Memphis ... but I thought our guys went toe-to-toe and we had our opportunities to pull back in it and have a chance to really put some pressure on them and that's what we were trying to do in the second half.\" \nThe defeat sent the Hurricane (3-4 overall, 0-3 American) to its fourth loss in five games, and former Union High School quarterback Justin Fuente, coaching in his hometown for the first time, picked up a 14th consecutive victory dating to last season. \nThe Tigers, who finished with 704 yards of offense, led by as many as 21 points in the second half and were helped by a trio of pass plays that resulted in gains of 40 yards or more, including touchdowns of 58 and 45 yards in the first quarter. \nNot to be outdone, Evans kept his team in the game by delivering his share of bombs, including three touchdown passes to Keyarris Garrett, whose career-high 268 receiving yards were the fourth-most by a Hurricane receiver in a game in program history. \nThe most impressive play of the evening came at the end of the first half, when Evans avoided a sack and launched a deep throw. Two defenders collided while trying to bat the ball down and instead tipped it into the waiting hands of Garrett, who fell into the end zone and trimmed the halftime deficit to 35-21. \nAfter connecting with Garrett on a 32-yard pass in the third quarter, Evans rolled to the left on the next series and found Josh Atkinson across the middle, and Atkinson took off for an 80-yard score that got TU within a touchdown. \n\"We got an opportunity right there in the third quarter where we got a couple big plays in there that kind of could have set it on fire,\" Montgomery said, \"and then we just let it get out of control there a little bit right after that.\" \nMemphis (7-0, 3-0) responded by scoring 17 unanswered points, benefiting by going 9-of-18 on third downs and 7-of-7 in the red zone. Running backs Dorland Dorceus and Jamarius Henderson combined for 269 yards and four touchdowns. \nWith top backs Zack Langer (hamstring) and D'Angelo Brewer (knee) sidelined with injuries, TU received only 113 of its 534 yards on the ground. Ramadi Warren, a Memphis native, scored his first career touchdown in the second quarter and tied the game at 14, and Rowdy Simon, a walk-on from Vian, scored his first career touchdown on a 4-yard run in the fourth quarter. \nThird-quarter observations from Tulsa beat writer Kelly Hines: \n* Evans keeps TU in it: Hurricane quarterback Dane Evans used his arm to produce back-to-back touchdowns in the third quarter. After Memphis took a 42-21 lead, TU answered with a 32-yard score in which Evans connected with Keyarris Garrett, who managed to get his left foot inbounds in the end zone. On the next drive, Evans rolled left and found Josh Atkinson across the middle, and Atkinson raced down the field for an 80-yard touchdown. \n* Third time's the charm: On drives that resulted in a Paxton Lynch 3-yard run and a 30-yard field goal by Jake Elliott, Memphis converted on five consecutive third downs. In the third quarter, the Tigers were 5-of-7 on third down. Through three periods, the team had 598 yards of offense. \n* Hurricane not seeing red: While Memphis was 5-of-5 in the red zone through three quarters, Tulsa was 1-of-1, having been inside the Tigers' 20-yard once and scoring on a 5-yard run by Ramadi Warren. The Hurricane's four other touchdowns were the result of plays that went for at least 32 yards. \nSecond-quarter observations from Tulsa beat writer Kelly Hines: \n* Another wild Hail Mary: At the end of the first half of the 52-38 loss at Oklahoma on Sept. 19, Dane Evans found Keyarris Garrett on a 43-yard Hail Mary. At the end of Friday's first half, Evans avoided a sack and launched a bomb, where two Tigers collided while trying to bat the ball down and instead tipped it into the waiting hands of Garrett, who fell into the end zone and trimmed the halftime deficit to 35-21. \n* Lynch looks the part: With six NFL scouts in attendance, 6-foot-7 Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch had his way against TU's defense in the first half. He completed 20 of 28 passes for 289 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions and no sacks. In addition to touchdown catches of 58 and 45 yards, the Tigers also scored on a wide-open 21-yard grab by Jamarius Henderson in the second quarter. \n* Penalties affect Tulsa: On the drive in which Memphis took a 28-14 lead, the Hurricane sacked Paxton Lynch for a loss of 12 yards on third down, but the play was negated by a holding penalty against cornerback Darrell Williams. Late in the half, Williams was flagged for a 15-yard face-mask penalty. On the same drive, a pair of penalties against defensive tackle Derrick Luetjen helped the Tigers find the end zone. \nFirst-quarter observations from Tulsa beat writer Kelly Hines: \n* Two backs sidelined: Ramadi Warren returned to action against the Tigers and earned the start at running back after missing last week's game at East Carolina, but Tulsa had two other backs missing: D'Angelo Brewer wasn't suited up and Zack Langer spent the first quarter rolling a softball under his left thigh, apparently addressing a hamstring issue. \n* Long passes burn TU: After giving up only two pass plays of 50 yards in the first half of the season, the Hurricane surrendered a 58-yard touchdown bomb from Paxton Lynch to Tevin Jones in the first quarter. Memphis also scored on a 45-yard touchdown catch by Anthony Miller late in the period. \n* Sacks hurting Hurricane: After giving up 12 sacks in the previous three games, TU allowed three sacks in Friday's first quarter that resulted in a loss of 20 yards. Quarterback Dane Evans was sacked on each of the Hurricane's drives that produced no points. Two of the sacks occurred on third down and forced punts. \nPre-game information: \n7 p.m. Friday • H.A.
