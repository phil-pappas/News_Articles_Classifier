He also said efforts should be made to resurrect respect for the secular values encouraging plurality of faith and belief. The Governor suggested that it would be fruitful if the universities were to take appropriate initiatives for the students to get them acquainted with the fundamentals of the “Rishi-Sufi” thought, the mystic poetry of Rumi and the great Persian poet Hafiz, who propagated universal brotherhood, love and compassion. He said it would help reviving the great tradition of aesthetics, culture, literature, music, dance, calligraphy, architecture, costumes and languages for which Kashmir was known in the centuries past. The Governor was addressing the inaugural session of the three-day international symposium on “Rishi-Sufi Traditions of Kashmir” at the University of Kashmir here today. The event is being organised by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) in collaboration with the University of Kashmir and the J&K Academy of Art, Culture and Languages. Scholars from India, the USA, Europe, Iran, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are participating in the event. Minister for Education Naeem Akhter was also present. The Governor welcomed the participants and complimented the ICCR for organising the event. He observed that the event took the participants back to over 600 years, when scholars and philosophers from several parts of the world travelled to Kashmir to engage in prolonged philosophical debates that led to evolution of the syncretic belief systems and traditions which, today, was popularly termed as “Kashmiriyat”. Vohra observed that the symposium was being held at a time when, in the name of religion, the world was being torn apart by radical and fundamental ideologies. Conflicts are taking place in many parts of the world, terrorist violence has emerged as an international phenomenon, the values of tolerance, communal harmony and brotherhood have been severely eroded and the world at large appears disinclined to resolve disagreements through peaceful means, civilised debates and discussions, he said. Centuries ago Kashmir witnessed intensive spiritual and philosophic debates among eminent religious scholars, historians, travellers and other important personages from Iran, Turkey, Central Asia, China and other countries making it a cradle, which fostered the birth of invaluable spiritual philosophies and traditions that symbolise the “Rishi-Sufi” way of life, said the Governor. He said the fact that the people of Kashmir were still devoted to the belief systems which emanate from the “Rishi-Sufi” traditions was evidenced by the admirable existence of a very large number of shrines in the Valley and elsewhere in the state that attract devotees not only from among the Hindus and Muslims, but from all other communities, and from all over the country. These shared traditions have proven to be crucial for promoting lasting connectivity and close understanding across the communities, Vohra said. The Governor observed that the damage done to the heritage of coexistence and to the Rishi-Sufi traditions had severely fractured the fabric of society. Today, we witness repeated incidents of terrorist violence in which dozens of innocent persons are getting killed, he said, adding that if peace and normalcy was to be restored and humanity was to remain civilised, radical ideologies would have to be denounced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:02.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
