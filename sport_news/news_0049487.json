And Kasey Hanlon got it done on the other side of the field. \nTogether they led Pen Argyl Area High School’s field hockey team to perhaps its biggest win of the season on Wednesday. \nHempeler scored 30 seconds into the second half and Hanlon stopped four shots to pace the host Green Knights to a 1-0 Colonial League victory over Slate Belt rival Bangor . \nHempeler’s goal came off a rebound of a shot by teammate Dana Evans, who was credited with the assist. The goal gave the Green Knights (9-5 overall, 9-4 league) a sudden jolt of momentum after a scoreless first half. \n“With the help of my teammates, we were able to get the ball out into our circle,” Hempeler said. “Dana shot it, and it came to me and I was able to finish it.” \nRELATED : Pen Argyl, Bangor field hockey teams have mutual respect for each other \nBangor had several offensive thrusts down the stretch, but Hanlon was up to the challenge. \n“It was a little nerve-wracking,” Hanlon said. “We really worked well together to be able to execute everything, and that enabled us to win.” \nHanlon has earned the utmost respect of her teammates and coaches. \n“Kasey has been our greatest goalie the past two years,” Hempeler said. “I’ll tell you, that kid has made a lot of big saves. We couldn’t have done it without her saves.” \n“Kasey is a great goalie,” Pen Argyl coach Fran Rowley said. “She’s quick and athletic. She really worked hard during the offseason. She’s a lot more aggressive, and she really commands the defense.” \nThe victory was big for the Green Knights on several levels. Not only did it come against their biggest rival, it avenged a 2-0 loss to the Slaters on September 12 and also put them in better position to qualify for the league playoffs. \n“We had to take care of business,” said Rowley, whose team clinched a District 11 playoff berth with Tuesday’s win over Wilson. “Every game lately has been like a playoff game.” \nHempeler’s goal was her sixth of the season. She’s scored less frequently than the previous two years mainly due to a position change. \n“She played left wing before and we moved her more into the middle,” Rowley said. “It’s made the team better and she’s really embraced her role even though it was a little tough for her at first. She brings the ball up the field and even though she doesn’t have the stats, she still plays a huge part in our scoring.” \nEmme Lentine scored both Bangor goals in the first meeting between the teams. However, Rowley said her squad made a concerted effort to mark Slaters junior standout Cheyenne Ott , who’s her team’s top scorer with 16 goals and 15 assists. Ott injured her leg and had to be helped off the field with 1:07 left in the game. \n“ Dana Evans pressured Ott the whole game,” Rowley said. “She’s such a great player. It’s unfortunate she went down with that injury.” \nThe Pen Argyl players had yet one more incentive to win Wednesday’s game. \n“If I could speak for the seniors,” Hempeler said, “our goal was to beat Bangor today because this is the last time we’ll play them on our home field.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
