And standing guard as that barricade crumbled were journalists.\nIn the early 1960s, it wasn't uncommon to find commercial billboards at ballparks or product endorsements by star athletes in magazines. For the most part, though, such crossovers were rare.\nIt all began to change later in that tumultuous decade, when the more savvy minds in business and sports recognized the obvious benefits of a marriage based on money. Auto races, horse races, and track meets initiated the turnover. The trend, however, was especially noticeable in golf.\nPGA tournaments that had derived their names from geography, entertainer hosts, or charitable institutions suddenly were redesignated to include their corporate sponsors.\nIn 1966, only two of the Tour's 39 events had obvious commercial connections in their names. By 1978, it was 11 of 44.\nThe Houston Open became the Michelob Houston Open, the Westchester Classic the Manufacturers Hanover Westchester Classic, the Flint Elks Open the Buick Open.\nIn 1969, a local tournament that had come into existence six years earlier as the Whitemarsh Open attached the name of Industrial Valley Bank (IVB).\nTo many news outlets in that idealistic period, the trend reeked of press-agentry. These sly corporations, it seemed, had devised a way to get free advertising, to mar sports' innocent facade.\nFaced with this obscene encroachment, The Inquirer fought back. All such sponsor names, including that of locally based IVB, were to be excised from copy.\nThe rule fit well with the ethical and journalistic revolution unleashed by Knight-Ridder's 1969 purchase of the paper from Walter Annenberg. Fresh, new editorial leadership tried to strip away any unethical remnants from a wilder, \"front page\" era.\nJust as the Associated Press Style Book then banned the use of corporate sponsors, so did The Inquirer. As a result, in 500,000 Philadelphia-area households daily and a million on Sundays, the IVB Philadelphia Golf Classic was merely the Philadelphia Golf Classic.\nTake that, you merciless money-changers!\nAttempting to counterpunch, IVB and tournament organizers dropped \"Philadelphia\" in 1980, assuming, I suppose, that \"The Golf Classic\" would be too generic for news outlets. No matter, in the pages of The Inquirer at least, the event Doug Tewell won remained the Philadelphia Golf Classic.\n\"It created some awkward constructions when events were tightly associated with sponsors,\" said Al Solomon, a Northwestern journalism instructor who in 1980 was the Inquirer sports department's copy chief. \"The Buick Open became That Golf Tournament in San Diego, or something like that.\"\nEvery similarly named tournament and race underwent the same kind of editorial surgery, prompting countless calls of complaints from frustrated companies and their public-relations arms - calls that a besieged sports department gladly transferred to the fifth-floor editors who mandated the policy.\nGradually, though, we all wore down. And when stadiums, arenas, and ballparks started to be renamed for sponsors, the risk of confusion - not to mention pomposity - was too great. Here and elsewhere, white flags were raised. Nike and its allies had triumphed over the mythology of sports purity.\nSince then, of course, corporatization has overwhelmed sports. Increasingly, the financial in-roads these companies have made allow them to dictate to once autonomous leagues and schools.\nAnd having conquered the pros, they soon turned their greedy eyes toward colleges.\nAs former Inquirer reporter Gil Gaul points out in his new book, Billion-Dollar Ball , nearly every facet of collegiate football is now merchandized and monetized to such an extent that, in 2012, the top 10 programs had a combined profit of $505 million, an uptick of 240 percent since 1999.\n\"Schools like Texas, Michigan, and Auburn now had profit margins that put the oil companies to shame,\" Gaul writes.\nAnd given its standing as the undisputed king of athletic sponsorships, Nike, whose website lists affiliations with 88 Division I schools, provides some of the most egregious examples of excess.\nAt the University of Oregon, which as Gaul notes is sometimes called the University of Nike, the company's founder, Phil Knight, donated $70 million toward a 145,000-square-foot football performance center. That facility, nicknamed the Death Star because of its futuristic look, has a weight room whose floor is made of rare Brazilian hardwood, meeting rooms whose seats are made of Ferrari leather, and a room dedicated to NFL scouts for their film review.\nMeanwhile, this year on the PGA Tour, where the phenomenon took root and where 38 of the 47 events now bear the names of commercial sponsors, the top six money-earners pocketed a combined $39.4 million.\nIn 1980, the top six made $1.9 million.\nThat was the year, by the way, that Tewell won the last - wait for it - IVB Philadelphia Golf Classic.\nBeing able to write that event's proper name in the Sunday Inquirer may indicate a victory of sorts, one of common sense over misguided principle. (It is still the sports section's policy to keep corporate names out of headlines.)\nIn a much broader sense, though, it reflects what's been lost.\nSports, to some degree, has always been a business. But for a time, when the dollar signs started to obscure our view, The Inquirer was there to strike them down.\nffitzpatrick@phillynews.com\n@philafitz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:31:45.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
