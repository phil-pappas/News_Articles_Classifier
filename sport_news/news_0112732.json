Comment Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 12:00 PM LAKE CHARLES The DeRidder Dragons (4-2)(0-1) hit a speed bump last week in their opening game of District 3-4A play against a very talented Crowley Gent team. While it was a disappointing loss for the Dragons and coaching staff, it showed what they needed to work on to finish the rest of District 3-4A play strong. The Dragons get no break this week as they host an always tough Washington Marion team (2-4)(1-0). On paper it looks like a no brainier that Dragon’s are the odds-on favorite, but the Chargin’ Indian record is no indication of the talent they have. The Chargin’ Indian offense is led by junior back Jacobi Taylor who has rushed for 1,908 yards on 182 carries with nine touchdowns. Taylor is averaging six yards a carry for an impressive average of 183 yards per game. The Chargin’ Indians are predominantly a running team, who through seven games have a total 1,585 yards on the ground. But can still pass when they have to led by Marquez Chagois with 216 yards, two touchdown and veteran QB L’Marcus Walker with 100 yards and a touchdown. The bright spot in the Dragons game last week was the “Black Shirt” defense who were able to contain the Gents ground game. On paper offensively the two teams match up evenly, with both being a predominantly running team. The key to victory Friday night will be both teams defenses. The Chargin’ Indians have allowed their opponents 163 points, while the DeRidder “Black Shirts” have allowed 142 points. If you can’t make Friday’s game tune into KROK 95.7 the home of DeRidder Dragon football.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:46:20.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
