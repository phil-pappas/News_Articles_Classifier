Semifinals for the events, which include both boys and girls singles along with boys and girls doubles, begin at 9 a.m., with the championship events to follow afterward. \n“I really want to get focused and I just want to play my game and want to give it everything I have,” Warnock said. \nWarnock, who drew a bye in the opening round, defeated Shirley’s Tessa Berry in the quarterfinals, winning in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0. Today, Warnock will face Hampton’s Lauren Marty in the semifinals, with the winner to face the winner of the other semifinal between East Poinsett County’s Kurstin Bryan and Earle’s Aundrea Allen. \n“I think I played well,” Warnock said. “I got the job done; I didn’t want to show off so I just mainly put the ball where it needed to be and just got it done.” \nIn her freshman season, Warnock — also a four-time conference champion — finished third at state before winning the championship her sophomore and junior years. She is also wanting to give her school an extra dose of pride by capturing a third straight state title. \n“I’m also thinking about my school because we don’t have the biggest sports program there is, but I think it means a lot to the school that we can have people who actually win state,” Warnock said. “The main sports that we win is tennis and track, so I think that will be a big accomplishment.” \nWarnock also has a big supporter in her mother, Jayne Warnock, who is Emma’s coach at Union. \n“Emma started playing when she was about five years old and we could just tell she was very athletic,” Jayne Warnock said. “If there was a ball, she could play the sport. She had great hand-eye coordination and she was just athletic, so we started her in tennis because I used to play tennis and she’s left-handed, which is a big advantage and she was just really good at it. \n“She tried other things and she loved tennis and we just joined the USTA (United States Tennis Association) and started doing it how juniors do; we would go to tournaments and she earned points. She’s currently ranked sixth in the state of Arkansas in the 18 and under for all junior players in the state.” \nEmma Warnock said having her mom as her coach makes it easier because they can both talk to one another on the court and at home. \n“If I’m not playing my best, she’ll just tell me to forget about everything else and just focus on your game,” Emma said of her mother. “Don’t play like the other players, just do you.” \nEmma Warnock added hitting is her specialty on the court. \n“I can hit the ball pretty well, but I can think about where I want to put the ball on the court. … If the player is standing where they’re not supposed to, I can hit it past them and they won’t be able to get to it, so I can place the ball,” she said. \nToday could be a family affair for the Warnocks. Not only is Emma going for a third straight state title, her younger sister, Rebecca, is going for one as well. Rebecca Warnock and Lexi Windsor are in the semifinals of the 2A girls doubles bracket. Union is also in position to grab the 2A team championship. \n“I was actually looking at the points because you get a point for every match you win up until the semis and then you get two and if you win the finals, you get three,” Jayne Warnock said. “Right now, we are neck and neck with Riverside, but I think if our girls doubles that plays in the semis (today) can win another match, I think that Union will win the whole thing. \n“If Emma wins the whole thing, which I expect her to, she will earn seven points for our school and I think if we can get even 10 points total we could win the whole thing, so I think our chances are good of us doing that.” \nRebecca Warnock and Lexi Windsor will face Parkers Chapel’s Allison Rogers and Bailey Norwood in their doubles semifinal at state. Warnock and Windsor won their first-round match Monday, 6-0, 6-0, before winning their quarterfinal against Elizabeth Ramsey and Hannah Hutson of Crowleys Ridge, 6-1, 6-1. \nThe other 2A girls doubles semifinal pits Mary-Morgan Ellis and Macey Vaught of Conway Christian against Riverside’s Abby Brickel and Hattie Milligan. \nIn today’s 2A boys singles semifinals, Riverside’s Grant Mason takes on Conway Christian’s Winston Strawn, while Kade Cushing of Parkers Chapel faces Nick Grice of Western Grove. \nThen in the 2A boys doubles semifinals, Riverside’s Gavin Stone and Jon Milligan faces Gurdon’s Devon Simpson and Garrett Clark, while the other semifinal involves Parkers Chapel’s Grant Brumley and Trace Blaylock against Riverside’s Braden Overman and Luke Baker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:29:22.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
