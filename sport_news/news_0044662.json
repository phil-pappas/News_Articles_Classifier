They are also third after two games in their Champions League Group G. \nWith some newspaper reports suggesting Mourinho's prospects at Chelsea were in doubt, the club released a statement on Monday afternoon to quash any speculation. \nIt read: \"The club wants to make it clear that Jose continues to have our full support. \n\"As Jose has said himself, results have not been good enough and the team's performances must improve. However, we believe that we have the right manager to turn this season around and that he has the squad with which to do it.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:19:07.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
