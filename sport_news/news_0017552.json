They lived a day as a New York Giant. \nThe North Edison and Iselin football teams practiced at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center in East Rutherford, the same facility that the Giants practice at every week. \nThey also got to meet two Giants playerse, linebacker Uani’ Unga and safety Brandon Meriweather, and had the chance to ask them questions and for autographs. \n“It was excellent, a lot of fun,” North Edison coach Danny Young said. “It just shows them that all the hard work is paying off for them whether it’s in school, with their parents or of course on the football field with their brothers.” \nThe teams practiced as they typically do, but the venue was very different. Instead of a grass field behind the middle school, the seventh and eighth graders practiced on brand-new turf in a state-of-the-art facility. \n“It’s amazing, nobody could get this opportunity,” 14-year-old Isaiah Noguera of Iselin said. “Everything that happened here will help us win a championship.” \nThe kids could also the feel the presence of the superstars who practice on the same turf that they did. \n“We had a little bit more energy just being at the Giants’ stadium, thinking Odell Beckham and Eli Manning have stepped in here and played,” 13-year-old Dan Ritchey of North Edison said. “I thought it would be really cool to play here just because of the fact that I hope to be here one day.” \nAfter practice ended, the kids took a knee in front of Unga and Meriweather and had the opportunity to ask two NFL players any questioned they liked. The two Giants defensive starters talked to their audience about the importance of hard work, especially in the classroom. \n“You have to keep up the grades to stay on the field,” Unga told the kids. \nThe kids pressed the two about what they should do to be the best players possible, which prompted Unga to talk about the mission trip he took to Guatemala before going to college. He lived there for two years. \n“It helped me become more mature,” Unga said. “I was definitely more mature than the other freshmen.” \nThe most important lesson the kids learned, it seemed, was the importance of hard work and good grades. \n“We learned we have to get good grades in school,” 14-year-old Tyler Montford of North Edison said. “Respect, hard work, dedication and teamwork are all important too.” \nSome of the other questions, as expected, were humorous. One player from Iselin asked Meriweather if he could get him a contract with the Giants. \nAnother player asked the two Giants what team they rooted for growing up. Unga responded with the San Franciso 49ers, which drew playful ire and boos from the Giants fans in the room. \nA rewarding experience for the kids, the NFL players also walked away from the experience with a lot to be grateful for. \n“It’s very important to us because this is where we all started and without this, there wouldn’t be the NFL,” Meriweather said. “Any chance you get to give back to these guys is really important to us.” \nStaff Writer Daniel LoGiudice: dlogiudice@gannettnj.com 42 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LsmZwk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:57:11.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
