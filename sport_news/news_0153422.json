Posted Sept. 28, 2015 \nAnother week, another big challenge for the Florida Tech football team. \nAfter a tight loss to No. 8 North Alabama last week, the Panthers head to Cleveland, Miss. To play No. 5 Delta State. \nFlorida Tech knows it will be a big challenge but are focused on rebounding from the 1-3 start. \n“They are hungry to get a win regardless of who we are playing, I don’t know that it matters as much as us just wanting to get a win,” Florida Tech football coach Steve Englehart said. “Being 1-3 isn’t any fun, especially when we have been so close. We are so close to being 4-0. I think they are hungry to get a win and regardless of our opponent right now, they are excited and have come out and practiced hard.” Florida Tech defense needs big day \nDelta State is the one conference team that has seemed to have Florida Tech’s number, beating the Panthers by at least three touchdowns in both meetings. Last season Delta State handed the Panthers their worst loss of the season – 58-20. But Delta State head coach Todd Cooley is not taking them lightly. \n“They are a dangerous football team, very good. They are 1-3 and they are just a few plays away from being 4-0,” Cooley said in his press conference this week. “They went toe to toe with the two-time defending conference champion and had a shot to win. Their backs are against the wall, they don’t want to start out the conference season 0-2. \n“This is going to be the toughest football team we have played, no doubt in my mind.” \nBoth teams come into the game with strong offenses that can put points on the board, which will put the onus on the defenses to slow things down. Delta State’s defense is coming off a shutout against Albany State and has come up with big plays all season as they are second in the conference in sacks with 10. They also have nine interceptions led by the duo of Joreco Beckwith and Greg Sims who have three and two respectively. \n“Our defense stepped up and answered the bell. We have challenged them and they have answered,” Cooley said. “We have a mature football team right now that comes in trying to get better and correct mistakes. If we keep doing that we have a chance to be really good.” \nThe Panthers have done the same thing this week and feel ready for the challenge. \n“Really, really good week. Just from an intensity standpoint, from an effort standpoint, from a focus standpoint I thought it was as good as we could ask for, I really do,” Englehart said. \nTODAY'S GAME \nWho : Florida Tech (1-3) vs. No. 5 Delta State (4-0) \nWhere : Parker Field-McCool Stadium, Cleveland, Miss.. \nWhen : 7 p.m. \nRadio : 89.5 FM, will have pregame and play-by-play. \nOnline : gscsports.org/ESPN3 \nSeries : Delta State leads 2-0 \nPlayers to watch \nDelta State – Tyler Sullivan.
