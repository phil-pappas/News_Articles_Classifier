It is reasonable to suggest those three runs could/should have resulted in a first down, leaving Detroit with no timeouts and the game all but over. \nSome will argue: 'But Detroit knew the Bears were going to run, thus making it harder to succeed.\" \nReally? If you thought the Bears should have thrown the ball, how could the Lions be sure they wouldn’t? \nA team has two goals in that situation: Convert first downs and force the other team to exhaust its timeouts. The Bears got half the job done. \nHonestly, I was screaming for a nice, safe, easy-to-complete play-action pass on second down at the time, but the problem there wasn’t that Fox/Gase ran the ball three times, it was that their defense allowed Detroit two chunk plays for 60 yards that took less than 25 seconds off the clock immediately after. \nAs for Fox not using his timeouts once the Lions were knocking on the door, how limited would the Bears have been on the ensuing drive to tie the game and get to overtime with no timeouts? \nAs it turned out, Fox never used those timeouts, but he couldn’t have known the Lions were going to hand him two pass interference calls to stop the clock and set up the tying field goal. \nFox did exactly what Bill Belichick did in Super Bowl XLIX after Seattle got to his 5-yard line with just over a minute left, and Belichick won a ring. \nYou can argue the Pats got lucky, but I beg to differ. Russell Wilson made a mistake and Malcolm Butler made a fantastic play. \nHad Belichick stopped the clock, with time to huddle on the sideline, would Pete Carroll have stuck with his decision not to give the ball to Marshawn Lynch? \nThe bottom line is if Belichick and Fox use their timeouts in those situations, they are clearly telling their defenses they expect them to fail and are planning accordingly because they can’t trust them to do their jobs. \nThat is not a message a coach ever wants to send either in the heat of the battle or for the lasting effect it can have on the hired help. \nPlease hear me when I say I’m not sure which would have been the best ways to go in those two situations. \nI’m just pointing out there is no certain right or wrong. \nAlthough, when you realize Fox got his club to overtime and gave it two more chances to win the game outright before a blown coverage on Calvin Johnson cost them the game, doesn’t that argue he actually got it right? \n• Chicago Football editor Hub Arkush can be reached at harkush@chicagofootball.com or on Twitter @Hub_Arkush.
