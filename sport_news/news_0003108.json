Pangilinan announced that he will step down as president of the national organization during a press conference at the PLDT head office yesterday. \nPangilinan’s term as president lapsed in February and he is disallowed from seeking another term as stated in the charter drafted by the SBP after it took the place of the Basketball Association of the Philippines as the FIBA-recognized body for Philippine basketball. \n“It’s for the best that I retire. We should follow the rules and prove to everybody else that I’m not here to tweak or tinker with them. I don’t want to violate the rules that we have crafted,” said Pangilinan. \nThe SBP will hold an annual assembly in January for the election of new officers who will make the decisions on crucial issues concerning the national team including its participation in the Olympic wildcard qualifiers in July and the newly reformatted qualifiers for the 2019 Fiba World Cup in China beginning in 2017. \n“It signals a change of leadership and membership of the board. Perhaps the new membership needs fresh blood for Philippine basketball,” Pangilinan said.
