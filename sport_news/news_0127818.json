Northeast volleyball hosted their final home match of the season, going 0-3 on Senior Night on Tuesday in Arma. The Vikings lost to Crest, 2-0, before dropping another 2-0 decider against the Jayhawk-Linn Jayhawks. Northeast closed out with a 2-1 loss to the Marmaton Valley Wildcats. “I didn’t think it was our best night,” said Northeast head coach Russ Cramer. “We were a little off. We didn’t have the intensity and focus that I thought we had (Monday) night.” The Vikings were playing their second set of games in as many days, and even though they had played nine matches in four days, Coach Cramer said fatigue was not a issue. “That can be challenging, but I expect us to play nine games in four days and it not be a factor,” he said. The Vikings started off with a 25-22 loss to Crest in the first set and then lost the second, 25-21. Against Jayhawk-Linn, both teams started off neck and neck before the Jayhawks took a 7-5 lead in the first set. The Jayhawks continued their run and took a 22-12 lead. With the Jayhawks win one point away from winning the first, the Vikings used a quick 2-0 run to try and get some momentum going. However, it wouldn’t be enough as an error gave the Jayhawks the 25-14. The Jayhawks used a strong start to take an 8-3 lead early in the second set. Northeast fought back with a 5-2 run, including an error from the Jayhawks to come to within two. The Jayhawks used a powerful run to pull ahead, 22-12, and eventually clinched the 25-12 win, taking the match. After the senior recognition ceremony, the Vikings started off on a strong 4-1 run to take an early lead against Marmaton Valley in the first set. NHS continued their run and took a five-point lead at 8-3. The Wildcats fought back and took a 19-16 lead. Northeast used a 3-1 run to tie the set at 20. After failing to clear it over the net, the Wildcats fell behind, 21-20. A few seconds later, the same thing happened for the Wildcats and Northeast took a 22-20 lead. It soon became a 3-0 run for the Vikings, forcing Marmaton Valley to call a timeout. The Vikings came out of the timeout by making an error on the serve, but a kill by Autumn Walker placed the Vikings on the edge of victory. Marmaton Valley did come to within one but the Vikings held on for the 25-23 win in set one. Page 2 of 2 - The Wildcats started the second set with a 5-0 lead. Northeast came back with a 5-0 of its own. Marmaton Valley jumped to a 15-8 advantage. The Wildcats stayed ahead and led 20-15 before too long. Marmaton Valley won the second set, 25-16, to force a third. With both teams going back and forth, the Wildcats went up, 18-10. The Wildcats soon took control and built a 23-12 advantage and finished off the 25-12 third-set win. “I just thought we didn’t communicate well,” Cramer said. “We have to play with passion and excitement. I thought tonight, we didn’t quite have the go that we’ve had on several other nights.” Kelsea Choate led the Vikings with 28 digs, while Lindsey Tindle finished with 14 and added nine aces in service. Lindsay Fox had 20 assists to lead Northeast. Before playing against Marmaton Valley, the Vikings honored their four seniors: Meghann Fountain, Jessica Zamora, Kayla Johnston and Seirrah Seal. “I’ve been proud of our seniors from the start,” Cramer said. “They’ve been through everything we’ve had. They’ve put in a lot of work over the summer. They’re so much better volleyball players than they were at the start of their careers and I’m proud of them.” Michael Bauer is a sports reporter for the Pittsburg Morning Sun.
