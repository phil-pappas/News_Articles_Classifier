In the 1st Quarter, Warriors at the Panthers' goal line. Quick give to Caleb Smith, he goes in for the touchdown.It's 7 - 0. Then it seemed both defenses loaded up on the pickle juice. They were energized, Kevin Whitson just blows up this play in the backfield. A loss of 5 on this play. More good defense from Bledsoe County, Brett Boring stuffs this run. Then it was the Panthers turn to play good defense. Warriors try to go wide but Tyler Thapa there with the tackle for the loss. Bledsoe wins a close one 14 - 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:37:34.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
