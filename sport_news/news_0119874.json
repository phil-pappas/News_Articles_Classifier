But he knows the Flyers will be fired up for their home opener. \n\"It was a little bit feisty at times, and it's early in the season,'' Gallant said. \"Teams want to win games and it's not about fighting. You expected something like that to happen when it's a 4-0, 6-1 hockey game at times. \n\"You're going to battle hard and I think they're going to be ready to play and it's going to be a different game.\"… \nJaromir Jagr, the NHL active leader in goals with 724, scored two goals, his second multiple-goal outing in his 21 s t game with the Panthers. ... \nPanthers rookie left wing Connor Brickley literally had an impact in his first NHL game as he had a game-leading seven hits to go with his first roughing penalty and a takeaway in 9:12 of ice time. \nLuukko with mixed emotions \nPanthers executive chairman Peter Luukko admitted to having slightly mixed feelings with two quick games against his beloved Flyers. \nLuukko served as president and CEO of Comcast-Spectacor for more than 25 years while overseeing the Flyers arena operations before leaving in 2013 and joining the Panthers last February. Luukko's son, Nick, was drafted by the Flyers in 2010 after playing at Vermont with Brickley. \n\"We certainly want to win and we know we need these points in October,'' Luukko said of the Panthers. \"I hear people say 'it's just another game' but these guys are my friends.'' \nLuukko believes last year's finish, then re-signing Jagr and hosting the NHL draft has given the franchise momentum which led to Saturday's sellout. \n\"People see the commitment. Our expectations are to make it [to the playoffs],'' he said. \"We're not here for fun. … We're just rolling the snowball here.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:34:10.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
