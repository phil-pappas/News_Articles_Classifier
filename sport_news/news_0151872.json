(AP Photo/Brandon Wade) slideshow \nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) â€” Falcons coach Dan Quinn says he expects receiver Julio Jones will be \"ready to rock\" on Sunday against the Houston Texans despite a new toe injury. \nJones participated in Thursday's practice after being held out Wednesday. He also was held out of the Wednesday practice before last week's game at Dallas to rest a sore hamstring. This week he is on the injury report with toe and hamstring injuries. \nJones said Thursday, \"I'm good to go.\" \nQuinn says he does not know when Jones hurt his toe. He says it is on top of Jones' foot and is not a turf toe injury. \nJones' 34 catches are the most in NFL history through three games. He also leads the league with 440 yards receiving. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
