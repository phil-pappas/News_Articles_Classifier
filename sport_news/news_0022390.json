There was no damage to arteries or nerves.\nCourson said all the damage is repairable and a full recovery is expected following surgery and rehab. Chubb currently is hospitalized for observation, and surgery would be expected sometime in the next two weeks.\nChubb took a handoff and ran left for a short gain. He was tackled near the sidelines and landed awkwardly on his left knee, which bent backward at a severe angle. As Chubb was carted to the locker room later, he was visibly emotional despite draping a towel over his head. Other Bulldogs appeared shaken, as well, at the injury to their star.\nThe sophomore was averaging 149 rushing yards (745 yards, seven touchdowns in five games).\nA week earlier against Alabama, he tied a Georgia record with his 13th consecutive 100-yard rushing game, a mark set by Georgia great Herschel Walker. Chubb entered Saturday's game as a fringe Heisman Trophy candidate .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2015/10/05/heisman-survey-leonard-fournette-trevone-boykin-nick-chubb-ezekiel-elliott/73410322/", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:36:12.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
