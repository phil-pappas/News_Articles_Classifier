In fact, it was a day the Stateliners had to forget. \n“We had a really good workout on Monday after the Easton meet,” Hardin said. “I really think that helped but the team back on track. I think we have put Easton in the past and that definitely showed today.” \nIt certainly did. \nHardin came in fifth overall in 16:44 Thursday and led the Stateliners to a sixth-place finish as a team. \n“All-around today, this was a much better performance,” said a smiling Phillipsburg coach Dave Post, whose mood on Saturday would have been inadequately negatively described as bleakly black. “A lot of times when a Phillipsburg team loses to Easton, it takes a while to get out of their minds, but we came right back here on Monday (the ‘Liners often practice at the high school) and ran the course in ½ mile stretches, and that was the best way to deal with Easton. That showed today.” \nHardin agreed, \n“This couldn’t have been better,” he said, “I felt really strong and I went out faster. I wanted to hold on to the top pack as long as I could. I was trying to conserve myself in the first mile because (eventual winner in course-record 15:44 Joe Dragon of High Point) went out so fast. I wasn’t going to stay with him.” \nWhat Post liked about Hardin’s performance was his tenacity. \n“Jake was fifth at the two-mile mark and not only did he hold the spot he expanded on the sixth-place runner,” Post said. \nSurely helping Hardin, who wound up as the sole Warren County runner in the top 10, was the pro-Phillipsburg crowd that made a racket every time they saw him. \n“It’s definitely a motivator to want to come out on your home course and take advantage of the home-field advantage,” Hardin said. “I always want to do better when I am running here.” \nNow, Hardin and the Stateliners are off to next Thursday’s Skyland Conference championships at Natirar Park in Somerset County. \n“That’s one of my favorite meets,” said Hardin, who placed 10th in 2014 at the conference meet. \nAnd now with Easton in the rear-view mirror, Hardin and the Stateliners can accelerate into what appears to be a brighter future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:50:04.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
