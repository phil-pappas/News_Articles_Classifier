Daily Messenger sports editor Bob Chavez joins long-time columnist Bill Pucko to discuss the Bills loss to New York, and look ahead to Tennessee. Bill: Just four games into the National Football League season and this is already getting old. I was telling people just last week that the Bills figured to be favored in all the games prior to their bye, and had the chance to hit their week off with a 6-1 record. Consistency is the mark of a true championship contender. This football team just hasn't learned how to win yet. That sounds so vague, but it's true. It takes time for the team and patience from the fans. I know the latter is in pretty short supply in Orchard Park these days. Bob: That Buffalo lost to the New York Giants is not so surprising. But after the Bills came into the game talking about how they had to control their emotions, they clearly didn't. Seventeen penalties for 135 yards is not acceptable. But Rex Ryan says it'll get fixed. Why should we believe him? Bill: We all knew he'd pay a price for all his bluster before the season began and frankly, the hope the coach brought to the franchise is worth it. But you're right. Ryan can't fix a problem he helped to create just by saying so. Anymore than he can guarantee a playoff berth. Just because he says it more demonstrably than his predecessors doesn't make it more likely. The talent on the team will determine that. Bill: The thing is, that game Sunday was there for the taking. To start the second half, the Bills had the Giants stopped in four straight possessions, forcing a punt and three three-an-outs. Then on a third down call which would have been Buffalo's fifth straight stop, Rashad Jennings sidestepped a tackle attempt by Nigel Bradham, and went 51 yards for a touchdown. That play was the game. There's usually only one and that was it. Bob: Exactly. This game certainly was within reach and the Bills shot themselves in the foot, which is sort of ironic even if Plaxico Burress wasn't playing. As frustrating as this loss is for the Bills, there are positive signs and it comes right back to what you said to kick this off: This team hasn't yet learned how to win. And if the Bills haven't learned yet that talk is cheap, I'm not sure they will. Bill: So it's off to Nashville to play the Titans, who come off a bye week. The Bills are three point favorites in a game no one expects them to lose. Same as Sunday when they were six point picks to beat the Giants. Bob: It's a tough pick because it's impossible to know which Bills team is going to show up. If the Bills can clean it up, they should have no problem winning against the Titans. They have the talent and if they want to keep the postseason dream alive, these are the games they have to have so when Sammy Watkins and LeSean McCoy return, the team will be able to roll them right into the momentum they could already have going for them.
