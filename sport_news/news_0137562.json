The longest in recent history was Sprague's 24-game winning streak from 2003-05. \nOne more win and South Salem (7-0, 6-0) would have the longest conference winning streak by a Salem-Keizer public school in a decade. \n\"I think it's a tribute to my coaching staff who is doing a good job, the kids who put in the work and continue to do the preparation piece each week, and we also have a talented group of kids,\" South Salem coach Scott DuFault said. \"We got some kids who are going to play college football.\" Buy Photo \nSouth Salem High School's Joseph Carey (6) makes a catch for a touchdown during their game with Sprague on Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015. (Photo: ASHLEY SMITH / STATESMAN JOURNAL) \nA win against McNary also would clinch for South Salem at least a share of the Greater Valley Conference championship, which would be the team's second straight. \nSouth Salem put together a checklist of goals before the season and this is the second one – the team accomplished the first one in clinching a state playoff spot a couple weeks ago – the team wants to check off. \n\"I think for this group in particular, we've got our eyes set down the road a ways, too,\" DuFault said. \"It's a big deal for us to win a conference championship, but we've got other goals, too.\" \nMcNary is tied for third in the GVC with West Salem at 4-2, but has scored a combined 91 points in its past games behind the prolific play of senior quarterback Trent Van Cleave, who has passed for five touchdowns and rushed for three in that span. Friday's high school football preview \n\"I think for us defensively it starts with knowing where No. 7 is,\" DuFault said. \"He's awfully good. He's starting to play with a lot more confidence. We haven't seen a quarterback like this yet. That's a tough thing to handle, a guy who can extend plays. \n\"Their running back's great. They're big up front. They've got some guys who can catch the ball. Defensively, their front four is awfully good, and I think they're pretty good.\" \nbpoehler@StatesmanJournal.com, (503) 399-6701 or Twitter.com/bpoehler \nMcNary at No. 6 South Salem \nWhen: 7:15 p.m. Friday \nOn the air: Radio on KYKN 1430 AM, video on CCTV2 Channel 22 at 11:59 p.m., livestreaming on www.clypian.com \nRecords: McNary (4-3, 4-2 GVC), South Salem (7-0, 6-0). \nDiabetes awareness night: This is the third annual event, which raised $3,500 last year.
