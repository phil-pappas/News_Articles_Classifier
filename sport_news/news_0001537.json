He said Aima had become first panchayat of the state which had introduced scheme for door-to-door collection of garbage. Addressing media persons here this afternoon, Shanta Kumar appealed to other panchayat pardhans of other one dozen panchayats adjoining Palampur town to follow the example of Aima panchayat and help the government of India in the successful implementation of Swachh Bharat Mission of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shanta Kumar said he was ready to release funds to these panchayats if they also undertake total cleanliness programmes in their panchayats. He particularly requested the panchayat pardhans of Ghughhar, Bindravan, Lohana, Bundla, Maranda and Khalet to come forward and start campaigns to keep their panchayats clean and green like Aima. Shanta Kumar also disclosed that he had planned to spend the entire MPLAD fund of Rs 5 crores under Swachh Bharat Mission and money would be released to those panchayats which work on lines of Aima panchayat. Shanta Kumar said panchayats near the important towns like Palampur, Baijnath, Kangra, Nagrota Bagwan, Nurpur, Banikhet, Chamba and Dharmshala should also come forward and launch door-to-door garbage collection in their areas. Shanta Kumar appreciated the efforts of SDM Baijnath Ashwani Sood who had started total cleanliness drive in Baijnath and Paprola panchayats with the assistance of local residents and had also succeeded. The veteran leader also urged the other SDMs of Jaisinghpur, Kangra, Dharamsala, Nurpur, Chamba and Dalhousie to persuade panchayats to join the total cleanliness drive in their jurisdictions. He said SDMs could play vital role in this noble cause as they have all executive powers to implement the plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:02:15.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
