She sat in the glow of a TV set, lost in the premier of Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" – 13 minutes of terror that sent the junior high school student dashing next door to find her mom.\nTrish Trout, now 72, remembered taking her petrified child home that night and watching a repeat of the video for herself. Trish, who was in those days earning a master's degree in theater at Portland State University, thought the mix of film, music and storytelling was, in a word, \"groundbreaking.\"\nMother and daughter, dressed as zombies, pushed into a throng of fellow ghouls on a sun-streaked street in Portland's Old Town on Saturday afternoon to celebrate the music video – as perhaps only the undead can do – by taking part in a six-minute group dance to \"Thriller.\"\nThe pre-Halloween event, called Thrill the World , celebrated its ninth highly choreographed tribute to \"Thriller\" on Southwest 2nd Avenue from West Burnside to Ankeny. Spectators crowded six deep around the zombie zone near the entrance to the Saturday Market, where they were treated to a homegrown version of the slick music video directed by John Landis, who co-wrote the screenplay with the late singer.\nJoining in was Aretha Donnelly, a 40-year-old writer from Los Angeles, who said the dance practices leading up to the event were grueling, although – \"God bless them\" – some folks didn't make a rehearsal until Friday night.\n\"This is a bucket list activity for me,\" she said. \"I love Michael.\"\nJoining the undead dancers were Portlanders Dana Mazer, a nurse practitioner in scrubs, and daughter Stella Coomes, a da Vinci Arts Middle School student, who was a dead ringer for Christina Ricci's Wednesday Addams . They practiced the moves in their kitchen.\nOrganizers of Thriller events around the globe describe them as a celebration – with nations as disparate as Russia, Rwanda and Romania taking part – of \"an exemplary humanitarian and performance genius\" and \"all people around the world as a community , regardless of political, economic or racial background.\" Local organizers raise money for charities at the events.\nThe dancing mass, with torn clothing and pallor-faced zombie makeup, blended effortlessly into a neighborhood rich with homeless folks, strolling drug addicts and a massive \"Keep Portland Weird\" mural on a nearby street.\nThe dancers, who crawl to life from the street during their routine, endured a couple of false starts – technical troubles that halted the music after several bars – before the song got underway for good about 3:04 p.m.\nYou haven't seen dancing until you've seen lines of stiff-legged zombies lurching to life.\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DE17DC6D36A5897", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA", "http://www.thrilltheworld.com/who-we-are/", "https://twitter.com/Bryan_Denson", "https://pdxccentric.wordpress.com/b11-voodoo-doughnuts/", "http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/davinci/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101272"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:18:52.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
