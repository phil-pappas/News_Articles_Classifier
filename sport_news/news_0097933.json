Ebenhack) The Seattle media didn't get a chance to talk to former Seahawk Golden Tate this week, but did get Matthew Stafford. So there you go. \nOne of the most obvious storylines of Monday’s Seattle-Detroit game is the return of former Seahawk Golden Tate to CenturyLink Field. \nTate was the leading receiver and punt returner for Seattle when the team won the Super Bowl following the 2013 season before signing with Detroit as a free agent (he also made maybe the most memorable catch in Seahawks’ history, the Fail Mary/Touch-ception against Green Bay in 2012). \nIt was a storyline the Seattle media hoped to pursue with Tate himself, hoping he would be the opposing player who would be made available in the weekly conference call. Each team makes one player available each week to talk to media who cover the opponent — Russell Wilson will talk to Detroit media this week. \nInstead, Seattle media got to talk to Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford, apparently in part because of comments Tate made earlier this week when he said Detroit’s opponents knew what plays were coming in all three games — the Lions lost all three in a start that marks the team as one of the most disappointing in the NFL so far (whether that was Tate’s decision or the team’s is unclear).

That was the story that was reported on last week, and last week was last week. We’re moving on.” \nAsked another question about it, he said: “We’re just trying to play as sound football as we possibly can. Run the ball effectively, limit turnovers and mistakes, and still be aggressive at the same time.” \nHere’s a bit more of what Stafford had to say: \nOn what Golden Tate brings to the team: “Just a guy with great catch and run ability, a guy that makes something out of nothing quite a few times. He did it last week, had a big play for us on a play that looked to be a negative play. At the same time, just an energy guy, plays hard on Sundays and last year was forced into a number one role for us when we lost Calvin [Johnson] for about half the year. He did a great job in that regard as well.” \nOn if Golden Tate could tell them anything useful about the Seahawks defense: “Not really. He played offense for them and he just tells me what he thinks of certain guys on the defense as far as the DBs go and things of that nature. Seattle doesn’t try to hide too much, they just line up and play their physical style of football, and it works for them.” \nOn if Golden Tat seems enthusiastic about playing against the Seahawks: “ I think so. I think he’s just happy to be playing another NFL football game. He loves playing, he loves getting out there on gameday and going. I’m sure he’ll be fired up for a Monday nighter.” \nOn how the Seattle defense looks different with Kam Chancellor: “He plays that position a little bit differently technique-wise than 35 (DeShawn Shead) did. He’s obviously a big physical presence, a guy that runs and hits extremely well, that can match up on tight ends extremely well too with his size and his length. Obviously, I’m not in their locker room so I don’t understand the leadership aspect that everybody talks about, I assume it’s there but at the same time he’s a really good football player on the field as well.” \nOn if the Seattle defense looks different with Kris Richard’s more aggressive style: “Not a ton different. Obviously there’s some tweaks and everything that certain coordinators bring, and he’s obviously a different one than they’ve had in the past. He seems to be bringing similar type things, but maybe just a little bit more often.” \nOn what makes Seattle’s defense different than Denver’s: “Different? They’re actually, maybe not schematically, but personnel wise, they’re similar. They both have very good corners, they both have good rush guys, their linebackers are really good players and sometimes underrated. From a personnel standpoint, they’re really good, both of them are. From a scheme standpoint, they’re a little bit similar in their thought process as far as being simple and letting their guys go play, but as far as coverage schemes and looks, it’s totally different.” Bob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
