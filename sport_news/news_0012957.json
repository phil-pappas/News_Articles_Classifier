(AP) - Attorney General Jim Hood says a former Greenville police officer has been indicted on a murder charge in the slaying of her husband.\nA news release from Hood's office Wednesday says 41-year-old Kvonya Moore was arrested Tuesday by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.\nShe's accused of shooting her husband, 44-year-old Reginald Moore, in the head with her police gun and killing him.\nInvestigators said Moore and her husband had returned home May 2 from her birthday party when the shooting occurred, and that the couple's two children were at home.\nHood's office says Moore, who had been the Washington County CrimeStoppers coordinator, was re-arrested Tuesday and released on $500,000 bail. That's up from $300,000 bail she posted in May.\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether Moore has an attorney.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
