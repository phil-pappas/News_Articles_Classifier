(AP) - Dak Prescott accounted for six touchdowns to lead Mississippi State to a 42-16 victory over Kentucky on Saturday night. \nPrescott looked like last season's Heisman Trophy-contender, passing for 348 yards and three scores while rushing for 117 yards and three more - all season highs. \nPrescott threw 288 consecutive passes, dating to last season's Orange Bowl, without an interception before being picked off in the second quarter. \nMississippi State (6-2, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) had 586 total yards and forced three turnovers on defense. \nKentucky (4-3, 2-3) scored a touchdown early in the first half, but could only manage field goals from there and never threatened in the second half. \nTaveze Calhoun had two interceptions and Brandon Holloway, De'Runnya Wilson and Darrion Hutcherson each caught a touchdown pass for Mississippi State. \nKentucky's Patrick Towles completed 23 of 42 passes for 218 yards with two interceptions and one rushing touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:18:53.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
