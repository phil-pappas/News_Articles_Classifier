Hingle, USA TODAY Sport) 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThere’s one thing to be said for college football. Even in a relatively quiet week, it’s not uneventful. A couple of upsets to top-10 teams caused most of the movement in the new Amway Coaches Poll. \nOhio State solidified its hold on the No. 1 ranking following perhaps its most dominant performance of the season to date at Rutgers. The Buckeyes claim 49 first-place votes, up four from last week. \nBaylor, with nine firsts this week, holds steady at No. 2 after downing Iowa State, but the Bears might be without starting quarterback Seth Russell for a stretch . TCU, which had the week off, also stays put at No. 3 with two No. 1 nods. Snap judgments from Week 8 of college football \nLSU edged ahead of Michigan State for the No. 4 spot. The Tigers receive one first after handling a non-conference challenge from Western Kentucky. They get a week off before a huge SEC West showdown at No. 7 Alabama. \nThe No. 5 Spartans, despite a strong outing from quarterback Connor Cook to get by Indiana, were outpolled by LSU by seven points. Clemson, a big winner at Miami (Fla.), remains No. 6 but gets a No. 1 vote for the first time this season. \nStock up: Stanford. There wasn’t a whole lot of room for upward mobility, but the Cardinal made the most of their opportunity after taking care of Washington. Stanford climbs three places to No. 8, nudging ahead of No. 9 Notre Dame, which didn’t play this week and only gains one position. College football's Week 8 winners and losers \nStock down: Utah. The Utes suffered their first setback of the campaign at Southern California. As a result, they take the biggest rankings hit this week with a seven-position drop to No. 14. \nStock up: Duke. They had to work extra hard for it, but the Blue Devils match the biggest gain of the week after their f our-overtime win at Virginia Tech. Duke checks in at No. 18. \nStock down: Florida State. The other top-10 upset victim, thanks to a crazy blocked field goal return on the game’s final play at Georgia Tech, takes a six-place plunge to No. 15. Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \nStock up: Houston. The Cougars also climb three slots to No. 19 after pulling away from winless Central Florida to keep their own record unblemished. They still trail fellow American Athletic Conference unbeaten Memphis, No. 16 this week, in the rankings. \nStock down: Toledo. The Rockets didn’t drop, but staying put at No. 20 while Houston inched ahead of them wasn’t a helpful poll result in the quest for a major bowl invitation. Nevertheless, Toledo did overcome a slow start to get by Massachusetts in Mid-American Conference action — or should we say, MACtion. \nNew kids on the block: No. 24 Pittsburgh, No. 25 UCLA. \nCollege dropouts: Texas A&M, California. \nGALLERY: AMWAY COACHES POLL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:25:24.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
