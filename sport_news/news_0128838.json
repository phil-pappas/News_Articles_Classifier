Rainfall is expected for Sunday's race and thick, dark cloud cover lowered the temperature markedly on Saturday.\nMeanwhile, Rossi's mood also blackened as pole position slipped away from him in the final minutes of the qualifying when Lorenzo stormed back to the top of the timesheets.\n\"It's a shame... because pole position is something that doesn't happen very often, especially to me,\" Rossi said.\n\"But that aside, I am satisfied about today. We worked well with the team. In the free practice, I was consistent. I was fast. We did a good strategy. I was in the right place.\n\"For sure, Jorge is always fast. We can try to stay close,\" the Italian said. \"I know I can do a little bit better.\"\nMarquez, standing 79 points behind Rossi in the championship battle, said his injured left hand was stopping him from riding at his full potential, allowing the sizzling Yamaha men to stay ahead.\n\"My finger is painful, of course, it's broke. But that's OK. I can ride more or less well,\" said the Spaniard, the season champion in 2013 and 2014, who will take painkillers for Sunday's race.\n\"I am closer to Valentino, but still not enough,\" Marquez said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:32:13.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
