All this was part of a conspiracy to destabilise his government, he said. Still clueless on who exactly was behind these “orchestrated” incidents of sacrilege of Sikh symbols, Badal said there were forces, including political parties, that were working together to destabilise his government. “The Akali-BJP government is committed to peace and communal harmony and incidents like sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib are aimed at politically harming the Akali Dal,” he said, adding that people of Punjab should understand that someone is trying to destroy the hard-earned peace of the state and respond sensibly to such provocations. Though he ruled out calling an all-party meeting or an emergency Vidhan Sabha session over the issue, Badal appealed to all political parties to try and maintain peace. The Chief Minister, in an impromptu interaction with select mediapersons here this afternoon, admitted that all efforts by the government to quell the public outrage had failed to give the desired results and his government was on its toes trying to establish the larger player behind these incidents. “Though some people have been arrested in Ludhiana today, we are trying to identify the real perpetrators of incidents that sparked protests across the state,” he said. Major cities such as Amritsar, Jalandhar, Moga and Muktsar remained tense. Badal denied that the government had collapsed when asked what his government was doing to ease the tension. He said the protesters only wanted that those guilty of perpetrating incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib be brought to book. The police were thus trying to trace them and asked people to give police some time. He said it was the top priority of his government to reveal the identity of those behind these incidents that were threatening to push Punjab to the brink. He admitted that people were angry, but denied that the anger was actually directed against his government over poor governance. Hold ‘path’ for peace: Dy CM Deputy CM Sukhbir Badal today announced to hold \"akhand paths\" at the district level across the state from October 21 to 23 in view of sacrilege incidents. SAD secretary Daljeet Singh Cheema said Sukhbir has asked district presidents to organise the \"paths\" to pray for peace and harmony in the state and seek forgiveness. Politics rife as crisis over ‘Bir’ sacrilege deepens Bhagwant joins protest in Sangrur Sangrur: Local MP Bhagwant Mann on Monday joined a protest organised at Mahavir Chowk by various Sikh organisations. Mann said he would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha and before the Human Rights Commission. He said he had demanded a CBI inquiry into the police firing that claimed the life of two innocent Sikhs at Bargari village of Faridkot. Mann said the government should also give Rs 1 crore compensation to the families of the deceased. Farm unions back Cong protest Bathinda: A group of 12 farmer and labour organisations on Monday joined the Congress’ protest against the government and sought the resignation of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. Congress MLA Ajit Inder Mofar said: “The Akali Dal has expertise in diverting public attention from burning issues.” Boota Singh Burjgill, president of the BKU (Ekta-Dakaunda), said: “During farmers’ protest, the government raked up the dera issue. And to divert public attention from pesticide scam, it brought up the sacrilege incidents, which is unfortunate.” Sarna guns for DGP Sumedh Saini New Delhi: A delegation of the SAD (Delhi) on Monday met Union Minister of Home Affairs Rajnath Singh and demanded removal of Director General of Police Sumedh Singh Saini and imposition of President’s rule in Punjab to control the ongoing unrest. The delegation was lead by former DSGMC president Paramjit Singh Sarna. The delegation told the Home Minister that pesticide scam, pardon to Dera Sacha Sauda chief and sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib were the reasons for the unrest. Instead of taking action against culprits, the police killed two innocent youths, he alleged. SGPC members, Akalis resign\nChandigarh: A number of SGPC members and SAD leaders on Monday resigned from their respective posts. The SGPC members are Sarbans Singh Manki of Samrala and Surinder Singh of Anandpur Sahib. The Akali leaders are former Rajya Sabha member Varinder Singh Bajwa of Hoshiarpur, Avtar Singh Kapur, Avtar Singh Kandhalan Jattan, Raj Singh Baddla, Kuljit Singh, general secretary of SAD’s Amritsar unit, and Amarjit Singh, SAD’s circle president and local councillor. The leaders criticised the police for killing two youths during a peaceful protest at Kotkapura. Bains brothers to gherao CM’s house Ludhiana: Accusing Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal of playing petty politics, Ludhiana legislators Simarjit Singh Bains and Balwinder Singh Bains have announced that they would gherao the CM’s residence on October 21. “There has been a concerted effort to create communal rift in the state. But Punjab has a long tradition of brotherhood which is hard to break,” said Simarjit. He accused the government of using “divisive tactics and policies” to deflect the public attention from the core issues and problems plaguing the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:08:49.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
