(AP) - Jeffrey Vitter, named as trustees' top pick to become the next chancellor of the University of Mississippi, says the problem solving of computer science informs his approach as a university administrator.\nAs provost at the University of Kansas, Vitter says his top achievement is a strategic plan that brought a core curriculum to the university and advanced scientific research.\nIn a telephone interview with The Associated Press Monday, Vitter offered no opinion on whether Ole Miss should stop displaying the Mississippi state flag because it contains the Confederate battle emblem. He says he's glad students are discussing it and says he's committed to diversity.\nVitter is scheduled for Oct. 29 campus interviews with students, faculty, staff and alumni. If all goes well, trustees are likely to hire him that day.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
