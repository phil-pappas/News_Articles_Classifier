He believes that football is more than a game, it becomes a lifestyle.\n\"I think there's a certain part of football — contact sports in general — that I really, kind of endorse,\" Brady said. \"When you have to make a commitment like we make as football players to your health and well-being, there's a certain discipline that comes along with that that translates to your life in general.\"\nBrady was a standout catcher growing up, and was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 1995 MLB Draft. Despite his prowess on the diamond, he doesn't think baseball provides the ideals that football does.\n\"In baseball if you're the pitcher, and a guy hits a homer, like OK, you gave up a homer, it' s a homer. But no one ever really charges the mound anymore, there's no accountability for certain things,\" he said. \" In football, and hockey — I have a lot of respect for those guys — and boxing, there is a different level of discipline because if you don't prepare, then you pay the price, physically.\n\"It's your body, you only have one body. It's your head, it's your knees, your hips, your feet, your hands. Everything takes a toll if you don't commit yourself the right way. So I think there's just a great discipline — the part of football that I probably enjoy, is like I said, that discipline part where the more you put into it the more you get out of it.\"\nWhen asked about the concussion risk, the 16th-year quarterback replied, \"There's risk/reward to everything in life.\"\nAt the end of the day, Brady said the only thing that matters is what his children are passionate about.\n\"Whatever your kid is into, obviously that's what I'll support,\" he said. \"So, whatever they want to do, that's what they'll do, and I'll do my best to support the things that they love.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:14:06.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
