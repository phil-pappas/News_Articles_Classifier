USA Today Sports 3 days ago by Jeff Gluck, USA TODAY Sports © Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports LOUDON, N.H. — NASCAR’s nerve-shredding, gut-mangling playoff is already in high gear after two races.\nAdChoices And after more dramatic ups and downs Sunday at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, it’s a good thing drivers and race fans have a week to catch their breath before the first elimination race at Dover International Speedway.\nThough Brian France said he wanted Game 7 moments for his Chase for the Sprint Cup, even he might not have been able to envision days like this one.\nSeven of the 16 playoff drivers faced significant adversity at New Hampshire, an event which isn’t exactly known for being a wild card race like Talladega Superspeedway or Martinsville Raceway. The “Magic Mile” turned out to be anything but for several drivers who faced an afternoon full of curses.\nWhere to begin? Perhaps with Kevin Harvick, who was about to pull off one of the great playoff wins in the format’s history and earn a free trip to the second round until he ran out of fuel with three laps to go.\nInstead of basking in the glory of a brilliant New England day, Harvick and crew chief Rodney Childers left the track without comment and now find themselves in a must-win situation next week at Dover (where Harvick is 0-for-29 in his career).\n“Somewhere, we were off in our calculations,” car owner Gene Haas told USA TODAY Sports. “That’s something we’ll be talking about tomorrow and the next couple days real hard.”\nMatt Kenseth inherited the lead — and the victory — when Harvick ran out of fuel, giving Joe Gibbs Racing its fourth consecutive win and a 1-2 finish with Denny Hamlin.\nBut it was heartbreaking day for JGR teammate Kyle Busch, the most inspiring story of this season after he came back from a horrible crash at Daytona International Speedway and made the playoff despite missing 11 races.\nBusch suffered a flat tire while minding his own business in the middle of the race, sending him crashing into the wall. Now he’s in danger of failing to advance past the first round — another potential Chase disappointment in a career full of them.\nAnd then there was Kurt Busch and Dale Earnhardt Jr., who were both enjoying good starts to the Chase and having solid races until they joined Harvick in running out of fuel at the finish. The result was especially tough for Earnhardt, who now finds himself just one point ahead of Kyle Busch for the final playoff spot with one race to go.\nOther drivers had enough time and opportunity to overcome setbacks that could have potentially poisoned their Chase hopes.\nJust look at Jimmie Johnson, who had a flat tire and was lapped at one point in the race, only to rally for a sixth-place finish. That was the kind of comeback fans are used to seeing from the six-time champion and his team.\nMeanwhile, Carl Edwards shrugged off a penalty for removing equipment from his pit box (a gas can went over the line) and somehow got a fifth-place result out of it. Both he and Johnson should be on to the next round as long as nothing goes wrong next week.\n“It’s what we needed,” Edwards said. “Now we go to Dover, have a little bit of fun.”\nAnd then there’s Brad Keselowski, the opinionated former champion who felt NASCAR made an example out of him when it issued a black flag for jumping the restart with 58 laps to go.\nDrivers had been howling for tighter enforcement on the restarts for weeks, with some saying restarts would only be respected once someone got penalized for breaking the rules on one.\nSomeone finally got penalized, but Keselowski certainly didn’t feel it was justified in his case.\n“It’s an entertainment sport, not a fair sport,” he said. “… I got the chance to do something again for the first time — first person to be penalized for jumping a restart when I didn’t pass anyone. So that’s a new one.”\nNASCAR Sprint Cup Series director Richard Buck said officials had to make a ball-and-strike call and were confident their decision was the right one.\n“We’re not out to get anybody,” Buck said. “All anybody asks for in this garage area is to be treated fairly, and we believe we did our job today.”\nBut even with the penalty, Keselowski gained enough spots to salvage a 12th-place finish — just another roller-coaster turn of events in a day full of them.\nSo after all the madness, what could next week possibly hold? To anyone daring to venture a guess: Good luck with that.\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jeff_gluck", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:35:11.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
