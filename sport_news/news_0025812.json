Wolves correspondent Tim Spiers picks out five talking points. \nNo case for the defence Wolves trudge back to kick off after Johnny Russell netted Derby's fourth. \nDefensive mistakes have hung over Wolves' season like the Banks's Brewery smell over Wolverhampton. \nAnd those errors are becoming as traditional as the famous old brewery, such is their regularity. \nDominic Iorfa and Emiliano Martinez were culpable for Derby's second goal, and Wolves were collectively statuesque for the third (a goal they could have avoided conceding simply by having a man on the post) before being picked apart for the fourth by a very impressive Derby team. \nJackett's excuse that his defenders are naive, which has been heard already this season, is one that will not buy him much credit with supporters who can instantly respond with the accusation that naivety is to be expected with such young players, so why not buy experienced ones? \nOr indeed, why let one go, in the form of you-know-who. \nSorting out the defence, or not, may well dictate whether Wolves' season ends up being a successful one. \nPartnership shows promise Adam Le Fondre scored his third goal for Wolves at the iPro. \nThe form of Wolves' two strikers, however, continues to show promise. \nBenik Afobe and Adam Le Fondre made it five goals between them in the last three matches, and while the pair have a long way to go before being the new Bull and Mutch, they are showing signs of an increasing understanding in their link-up play. \nWolves need them to continue firing because they still don't possess enough goals in their midfield to allow for a slump from their strikers. \nThat need is increased further as they only have untried teenager Bright Enobakhare as back-up. \nTime to tighten up? Conor Coady returned to action after a four-game absence. \nJackett has consistently asserted that he won't sacrifice an attacking mentality to try and tighten up at the back. \nIt's an admirable approach, but with Wolves so fragile in defence it might be time to revise that theory. \nNo promotion campaign will be built on anything other than solid foundations and if it takes a few drab 0-0 draws or scrappy 1-0 wins to give Wolves some badly-needed consistency, so be it. \nLast season they often excelled in fast-paced counter-attacking football. \nThis time around the focus has been more on possession and precision, which against weaker teams works fine when McDonald and Price are free to try and unpick those locks. \nAgainst Derby, with Wolves on the back foot, they were unable to exert any dominance in midfield and struggled to cope with the excellent Johnny Russell and Bradley Johnson. \nConor Coady added steel when he came on and arguably, although it's easy to say in hindsight, should have started. \nBut against the better teams - Middlesbrough this Saturday being one - Wolves need a 'plan B' to adequately frustrate the opposition. \nWallace yet to shine Jed Wallace - yet to hit top form. \nAnother audition for the left midfield slot, another opportunity not taken. \nJed Wallace has shown glimpses and flashes of quality in his stop-start Wolves career so far, but the former Portsmouth man has yet to prove he can excel at Championship level. \nHindered by an knee injury picked up on the first day of the pre-season tour to France, Wallace has taken time to get up to speed following the first injury of his professional career. \nHis work rate is undeniable and there are signs of a very good player there, so patience is required. \nWolves need creativity and vibrancy on both flanks though and at the moment only James Henry is delivering. \nWallace, Sheyi Ojo and even David Edwards have all been given chances to stake a claim for Bakary Sako's vacant position. \nIronically the player to impress most of all in the role was Henry, who was magnificent against Charlton in August but is still better suited to the right flank. \nWith Ojo more effective from the bench for now, Wallace may get another opportunity against Brentford. \nA show of faith from Jackett might give him the confidence he needs. \nSquad too thin? Kenny Jackett. \nA glance at Derby's bench starkly demonstrated the disparity in quality - and depth - of the two club's squads. \nBut even more pertinent than that was the alarming difference in experience. \nDerby's seven subs have a combined number of 1,980 career league appearances between them. Wolves' bench have amassed three times fewer, on 671. \nJacob Butterfield, a £4m signing from Huddersfield, Andreas Weimann, who cost £3m from Villa, England international Darren Bent, the versatile and experienced Chris Baird, Premier League regular of many years Stephen Warnock and ex-Stoke defender Ryan Shotton were Derby's outfield options on the bench, with Lee Grant (428 career league appearances) their goalkeeper. \nWolves' bench contained their only spare senior defender Matt Doherty, who has 100 league games under his belt, and their only spare striker, teenager Enobakhare.
