Ad Feedback \n\"I try not to think about it too much and just focus on the job I have to do at the moment, but it's exciting.\" \nNew Zealand qualify one girl for the test event provided they meet the scoring criteria and McGregor felt it was within her reach particularly now she has experience of big competitions. \n\"It was awesome to get such high scores at nationals, and know that it's possible if I keep doing what I'm doing.\" \nThere was also success for Canterbury in the other senior events with Maggie Takami winning the Rhythmic Gymnastics title. She held off a strong challenge from fellow Cantabrian Keziah Oliver to win with a score of 52.469 after her ball, club, ribbon and hoop routines. \nMadaline Davidson also took home the senior women's trampolining title ahead of Bronwyn Dibb and Bethany Long. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:37:07.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
