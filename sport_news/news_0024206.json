The resulting defensive effort, which also had Luke Vermilya moving to inside linebacker, saw Trinity hold Bethlehem to one score through three quarters while taking a 14-0 lead into halftime. \nTrinity’s other senior starting quarterback — Dominick Reed — sparked his team with an interception late in the first half, setting up the Lions on Bethlehem’s 6-yard line before finishing the offensive drive out on a scoring run. \nJoseph Cotton scored three touchdowns and Vermilya and Ben Kritko also added touchdowns in the victory. \nThe win now sets up a showdown for first place in 1-AAA next week at home against Loganville Christian (7-0, 4-0), which was off on Friday. \nA victory by the Lions clinches a region title, while Trinity could finish off a perfect region schedule by picking up wins over Loganville and crosstown rival The Heritage School.
