Cox/Getty Images The Nationals could be looking to move Stephen Strasburg. There is buzz that the Nationals could make Stephen Strasburg available in a trade this winter, according to a new report.\nAdChoices Strasburg battled injury for a portion of 2015, but with the Nationals retooling and trying to manage salaries, Strasburg could be dangled as a trade chip, according to the Boston Globe’s Nick Cafardo .\nStrasburg is a free agent after the 2016 season, and with Scott Boras as his agent, he is extremely likely to test the open market. The right-hander made $7.4 million this season and could see a pay hike through arbitration this winter. With players such as Bryce Harper about to become extremely expensive, it makes sense that the Nationals will reassess their roster to carve out a path forward for the future.\nEven with only a year of team control left and an injury history worth considering, the Nationals would have plenty of suitors if they did move Strasburg, as he’s still one of the better pitchers in the game when healthy. It could be a good opportunity for Washington to acquire a group of younger, cheaper players to fill multiple positions as they look to move forward from their enormously disappointing 2015.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/10/17/teams-will-make-power-play-baseball-offseason/X33s3eHxG8wrbk9br3HNUM/story.html?event=event25"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:49:46.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
