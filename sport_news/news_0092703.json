Foster caught up with it just in time to beat Camp Verde's goalkeeper for the score.And since Farnsworth had already made it a 1-0 affair after her goal in the 15th minute, the lucky bounce put Chino Valley up 2-0.\"It was some kick,\" Chino Valley head coach Allen Foster said about his goalkeeper's strong boot that led to odd goal.Foster would score her second goal of the night in the 62nd minute to put Chino Valley [12-4 Overall] up 3-1 after she took it right from Camp Verde's goalkeeper, who was attempting to kick it out of the box.It is the second straight win for the Cougars, and their 11th out of the last 12 matches, but despite that, Chino Valley hasn't budged from their No. 7 ranking in the AIA Power Point Poll for Division V.\"The downfall is we're not moving up in the rankings, but with Blue Ridge next week, that may change,\" Foster said.
