It's a meeting of two Top 10 offenses. Here are three keys:\n1. Running in the rain: The forecast for Friday night in Tulsa? Not very good. Rain is expected, and rain may lead both offenses to run the ball a bit more than usual. That should play to Memphis' strengths, and could create problems for the Golden Hurricane, which ranks 118th of 127 Football Bowl Subdivision teams in rushing yards allowed.\n2. Slowing the Hurricane: Tulsa, much like Bowling Green, runs a Baylor-style offense. That scheme gave Memphis problems the first time around. The Tigers' defense has shown incremental signs of improvement in the weeks since, but Friday will still present a major challenge. Memphis will look to slow Tulsa's up-tempo attack by winning early downs and rushing the passer, thereby disrupting its rhythm.\n3. Early focus: Memphis' win over Ole Miss was probably the most physically and emotionally draining game it'll play all season. Will that affect the Tigers in the first quarter Friday? Tulsa wants to make this a track meet, and getting out to a quick lead would certainly help it achieve that goal. Memphis needs to avoid contributing to that by playing smart -- limiting penalties and turnovers, as it has for much of the year.", "external_links": ["http://app.contenttools.co/polls/2052/embed.js?show_name=yes&show_description=yes&show_sharing_options=yes&show_cover_image=yes"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:34:25.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
