Foster was carried off the field and carted to the locker room.\nAdChoices NFL Network reported that the injury was a torn Achilles and would end Foster's season.\nFoster had 125 yards and two TDs from scrimmage, yet it all came in garbage time after the Dolphins built a 41-0 first-half lead. Texans coach Bill O'Brien seems sure to regret using such a valuable player (on a wet field, too) with so little on the line at that stage of the game.\nHere are the other notable injuries from Week 7:\n— Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford suffered a left hand injury and will have X-rays\n— Washington Redskins pass rusher Ryan Kerrigan suffered a broken hand.\n— Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Louis Murphy suffered a knee injury.\n— New York Jets center Nick Mangold suffered a broken hand and will have X-rays.\n— Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown left the game against the St. Louis Rams with a shoulder injury and did not return.\n— Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Phillip Dorsett was ruled out against the New Orleans Saints with an ankle injury.\n— Tennessee Titans cornerback Jason McCourty suffered a hamstring injury against the Atlanta Falcons.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:06:24.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
