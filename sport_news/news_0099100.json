Because, maybe at this stage, we still don’t believe enough.” \nIn the wake of their fortuitous escape against Scotland, Cheika is understood to have asked each player whether they believe the team can go on and achieve World Cup glory. \nBased on Genia’s forthright response, there’s little doubt the belief exists. \n“I genuinely believe,” Genia said. \n“What (Cheika is) trying to get at is that if you think you won’t (succeed), you won’t. \n“You’ve got to eliminate all doubts and think you deserve to win it because you’ve done the hard work. \n“You’ve got to believe you can win it – you can go all the way. That way, you take out any doubts. \n“The moment you start having doubts, that hesitation creeps in. And you sort of fall off the pace a little bit. \n“The self-belief is built over all the hard work everyone has done. \n“That has to continue day by day because his big thing is one little thing can change that; one little thing can give you belief.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:47:44.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
