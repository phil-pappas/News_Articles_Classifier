In such cases, section 8(5) of the Privacy Act stipulates that the institution head must notify the privacy commissioner in writing “prior to the disclosure where practicable” or soon afterward.\nThe privacy commissioner, in turn, may notify the affected individual their personal information is being disclosed.\n“Our office does not appear to have received a public interest disclosure notification under subsection 8(5) related to this issue,” Lawton said.\nAmara, born in Jordan, was arrested in 2006 along with several others for allegedly plotting to set off bombs in the Toronto area. He was sentenced in 2010 to life in prison.\nAccording to the National Post, Amara got a notice in June informing him of the government’s intention to revoke his citizenship. On Sept. 25, he received a letter confirming the move at the Quebec penitentiary where he is serving his sentence, the newspaper said.\nOn Sept. 26, Defence Minister Jason Kenney tweeted that Amara so despised Canada he “forfeited his own citizenship” by scheming to murder civilians.\nKenney said in an interview with The Canadian Press the same day that Amara deserved to lose his citizenship for being guilty of “violent disloyalty to Canada.”\nSeveral other convicted terrorists — including at least one born in Canada — have received notices informing them of the government’s plan to pull their citizenship.\nThe British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers and Asad Ansari, who was convicted along with Amara in the 2006 plot, have launched a constitutional challenge of the new provisions.\nThey argue that the revocation law, among other things, violates the principle that a person cannot be punished twice for the same offence.\nThe NDP and Liberals say they would scrap the new measures.\nFollow @JimBronskill on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:27:58.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
