Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson (4) celebrates after a play during the first half of an NCAA College football game against Miami, Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015 in Miami Gardens, Fla. By RALPH D. RUSSOAP College Football Writer \nNothing brings out the I-told-you-so crowd in college football like a surprising team losing for the first time. \nWhat a fraud! Overrated! Exposed! \nSuch was the reaction from many fans when Utah was removed from the list of unbeaten teams in FBS by Southern California. The turnover-filled 42-24 loss in Los Angeles certainly laid bare the Utes' faults: inconsistent quarterback play by Travis Wilson and a shortage of explosiveness in general on offense. \nThe Utes dropped from No. 3 to No. 13 in The Associated Press College Football poll on Sunday, but to say Utah was exposed suggests those shortcomings were being ignored. And that the Utes had not earned the first-place votes they were receiving. \nVoting a team No. 1 doesn't necessarily mean it has to stay there to validate that vote. A voter can at one time believe the Utes deserved to be atop the poll and fully expect them not to stay there. \nUtah lost to a talented team. It happened to Alabama. It happened to Notre Dame. Both are still in the College Football Playoff race and the Utes a capable of doing the same. \nHeat checking the latest Top 25. \nNo. 1 Ohio State (8-0) \nJ.T. Barrett's Buckeyes Cardale Jones' Buckeyes. Though Jones might have been wondering why he didn't get to face Rutgers' defense. \nNext: Minnesota, Nov. 7 \nHeat check: Still a bit too hot, but the defending national champions are trending up. \nNo. 2 Baylor (7-0) \nQB Seth Russell (neck) is likely to miss some time. How much is unknown, but the timing could not be worse. Baylor has the toughest November schedule in the country. How good the Bears are might come down to how good highly touted freshman Jarrett Stidham can be. But if Heat Check had to pick one coach to get a freshman quarterback to play at a championship level, Art Briles would be that coach. \nNext: at Kansas State, Nov. 5. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 3 Clemson (7-0) \nBeating Miami isn't what it used to be, but no team has ever beaten the Hurricanes the way the Tigers did. Maybe the definition of Clemsoning should now be playing like the No. 1 team in the country. \nNext: at North Carolina State. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 4 LSU (7-0) \nQB Brandon Harris has lifted some of the offensive load from TB Leonard Fournette and removed some of the doubt about LSU. \nNext: at No. 7 Alabama, Nov. 7. \nHeat check: Just right. \nThe Big 12 favorite now? Maybe. \nNext: West Virginia, Thursday. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 6 Michigan State (8-0) \nThere are at least a couple teams with one loss that should be ranked ahead of the unbeaten Spartans. \nNext: at Nebraska.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:47:45.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
