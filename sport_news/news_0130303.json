He added that he's \"not at all\" worried about the prized freshman guard's eligibility.\n\"We haven't been given any reason to be alarmed about anything in terms of him moving forward, in terms of his eligibility status because of an official visit that he may have taken to another school,\" Jones said. \"I've addressed with (the team) about making sure that they support him and make sure that they rally around him and this, too, shall pass, and it will move on. But it's in the moment now and it's something that he'll grow from.\"\nIn exchange for cooperation with an investigation, NCAA rules allow for immunity to be granted to student-athletes who might otherwise find their eligibility in jeopardy. ESPN's report Tuesday included five former Louisville players or recruits who corroborated the gist of Powell's book.\nBlakeney was originally scheduled to attend SEC media day, but LSU understandably found a substitute.\nKyle Tucker covers college sports for The Louisville Courier-Journal , a Gannett company.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2015/10/21/coach-blakeneys-visit-between-him-and-god/74344964/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:18:19.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
