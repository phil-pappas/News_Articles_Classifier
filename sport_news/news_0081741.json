Being freed from fantasy football really opens up the mind. \nOn another channel, a new season of those addicting police dramas was beginning, breaking a monotonous string of re-runs; those shows have become a nice escape from the sports world for a few hours on a night off. \nBut for the first time in quite a few years, the remote control kept finding the channel that was showing the Minnesota Twins game. \nYes, a Twins game in September that mattered. Remember those? \nPerhaps it's the mundane, daily schedule of baseball that makes it hard to watch in June and July. Perhaps it's the increased intensity with which players celebrate a home run or a strikeout, regardless of how it might be received in the opposing dugout, that makes it more watchable in September. \nWe're already getting to the point where some of you don't have vivid memories of the World Series victories of 1987 and 1991, when the Metrodome was the place to be to act goofy and wave a white handkerchief. There have been few sporting experiences that have matched those home games on the fun meter, with Jack Morris on the mound or Kirby Puckett leaping against the centerfield fence. \nThe Twins have had other relevant seasons since then that provided some must-watch TV: Game 163 in 2009, plus playoff seasons of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2010. Even though those seasons came to an abrupt end, it was a lot of fun watching the Twins get there. \nThis weekend, it looks like things might not end well for the Twins, who have shocked the local fan base by contending for a wild-card spot in the final week of the season. The most optimistic fans were hoping that young talent would emerge this season with the chance of being in this spot in 2016. \nBut a few of the veterans have produced beyond expectations, and some of the rookies have arrived and thrived, allowing the Twins to break a four-season losing streak and be in the playoff conversation in the final weekend. \nSo here it is, a weekday night, the recliner extended about halfway back, the remote control locked into the right hand. Professional football? Police drama? Or Minnesota Twins? \nMany fans will disagree that September baseball is more enjoyable to watch than September football, and there are those who don't watch sports on TV. But on this night, with plenty of options, the home TV was showing the Twins game. And it was fun. \nChad Courrier is a Free Press staff writer.
