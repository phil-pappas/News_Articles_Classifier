Unlike last year’s tournament, where Trinity and Heritage advanced on opposite sides of the bracket, the county rivals will face each other in the Final Four for the first time. \nThe winner of today’s 2:30 p.m., match will immediately advance to the best-of-5 GISA State Championship. \nTrinity’s lineup, which includes five seniors, improved to 32-4 this season after defeating Holy Spirit and Region 2 champion Val- wood, which entered Friday undefeated. \nHeritage School, meanwhile, advanced with victories over Dominion Christian and Region 4 champion Augusta Prep. \nLooming on the other side of the state bracket is Oak Mountain, which also returned to this year’s GISA Final Four after finishing as runner-up to Trinity Christian in 2014. \nOak Mountain had handed the Lady Lions two of their four losses this season.
