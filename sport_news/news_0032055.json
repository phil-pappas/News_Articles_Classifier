Super Bowl 50 \nSuper Bowl 50 will be played at the new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. \nSuper Bowl 50 will be played at the new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. (Danny Moloshok / Associated Press) Matt Wilhalme \nSuper Bowl 50 will be played Feb. 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. \nThe game will be broadcast on CBS and is scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m. \nThe $1.3-billion Levi's Stadium opened last season and is the home of the San Francisco 49ers. \nSuper Bowl 50 -- the only game without a Roman numeral in its name -- will mark the return of the game to California for the first time since 2003, when Super Bowl XXXVII was played at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium. \nQualcomm was also the site of Super Bowl XXXII in 1998 and XXII in 1988 when it was known as the Jack Murphy Stadium. \nIn all, California has hosted 11 Super Bowl games, not including Super Bowl 50. \nThe Coliseum hosted Super Bowl I and VII and the Rose Bowl was the site for games XI, XIV, XVII, XXI and XXVII. \nStanford Stadium hosted Super Bowl XIX in 1985. \nSuper Bowl LI is scheduled to be held Feb. 5, 2017, at the Houston Texans' NRG Stadium. \nIt was a sad day when the NFL decided to standardize the Super Bowl logo design and neuter the creativity that millions ogled, cheered and, sometimes, ridiculed. Gone are the days of wondering how designers will weave the heartbeat of the host city into the traditional elements of the logo.For now, all we can do is look back and see the transformation of the logo from year to year, and comment on your favorite ... or least favorite.
