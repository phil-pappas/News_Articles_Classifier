On Sept. 18, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported there have been 22 cases of West Nile virus in Illinois this year, leading to three deaths. In the NSMAD area, there have been two cases where humans have been infected as of Sept. 18. Those numbers are far smaller than what happened in 2012, when there were 20 cases of humans being infected.\nThere may have been fewer West Nile virus cases in 2015 in the NSMAD territory, but the workload has remained the same. During the summer, crews lay traps for mosquitoes that are then brought back and analyzed three times a week. New NSMAD Executive Director Roger Nasci, who took the position in July after a 24-year career at the Centers for Disease Control, says the area's conditions make it a tricky endeavor to keep the virus in check.\n\"There is something about the ecosystem where the birds, the mosquitoes, the people and the virus all come together in the right combinations to cause these periodic outbreaks,\" Nasci said.\nOnce the traps are collected, biologists sift through the material collected to see how many mosquitoes are carrying West Nile virus. If necessary, the NSMAD will spray areas for 45 to 60 minutes to prevent an outbreak.\n\"Ninety percent of our operations is larva control. We are trying to stop them before they hatch into flying adults. It is more cost effective and it is more efficient,\" said NSMAD spokesman David Zazra. \"Basically, we get a better kill.\"\nDespite being relatively new on the job, Nasci has seen why this can be a breeding ground for West Nile virus given the characteristics of the stormwater-handling system.\n\"In our district alone, there are about 60,000 catch basins,\" Nasci said. \"They all have a reservoir at the bottom that holds water and the mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus love those habitats. There is organic material in there where it gets hotter and dryer and they stagnate and that brings in a lot of mosquitoes in our heavily populated neighborhoods.\"\nWhile not many disagree with the mission of mosquito abatement districts in general, there are concerns about whether Illinois – which has more taxing units than any other state in the country according to the U.S. Census – needs four mosquito abatement districts in the Chicago-area alone.\nOverall, the NSMAD has a $1.5 million budget. The agency, which has five trustees appointed by Cook County commissioners, operates with eight full-time employees plus 15 seasonal employees.\n\"People just want the service provided and nine out of 10 people have no idea which mosquito abatement district they live in and they just want the service provided,\" said State Rep. Ron Sandack (R-Downers Grove).\nSandack then pointed to the ongoing budget battle in the state capital.\n\"Everything about what is happening in Springfield ties together and there are no vacuums here,\" Sandack said. \"A taxpayer needs only to look at their tax bill to see how many different units of government there are in Illinois. Other states are providing the same services far more efficiently than we are.\"\nBut Nasci has a different take.\n\"You are going to have to provide the same services that are provided by the special taxing district anyways and you will still need to have these satellite locations,\" he said. \"You have special taxing districts with the units that are tailoring their services to the community's wishes and needs and the ecosystems that they serve.\"\nAs temperatures have started to dip for fall, Nasci has found time recently to reflect on his new responsibilities plus prepare for the summer of 2016.\n\"The last couple of the months have reinforced the complexity of doing mosquito control in an urban setting,\" Nasci said. \"As we transition into our fall and winter season, we will evaluate our surveillance and determining how well our control programs have worked.\"\nDaniel I.
