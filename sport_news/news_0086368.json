The 35-year-old Klentak had been the Angels assistant general manager since November 2011.\nKlentak replaces Ruben Amaro Jr. He was fired in September by new team president Andy MacPhail.\nKlentak previously worked for MacPhail in Baltimore as the Orioles director of baseball operations from 2008-11. He then served as the No. 2 man behind GM Jerry DiPoto for four seasons. Klentak interviewed for DiPoto's job after he resigned this summer. The Angels hired Billy Eppler earlier this month.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
