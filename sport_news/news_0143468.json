Show Caption Previous Next \nVERO BEACH — It was the best round of the tournament, but it came on the North Course — not the West Course where match play will be held. \nRobby McWilliams, of Benton, Louisiana, shot a 6-under-par 65 on the John’s Island Club’s North Course Sunday and breezed into match play Monday with a two-day total of 1-under-par. \nMcWilliams’ 65 is a “competitive course record” on the North Course, according to USGA officials. \n“Drove it well and made some putts,” McWilliams said. “I was bogey-free (Sunday) and I think I missed only three fairways and three greens. \n“After shooting 5-over (Saturday) on the West Course, I was doing everything I could to get back to even. I got to 3-under on my front nine (Sunday), and I just kind of stayed in my game there on the back nine.” \nNow, McWilliams heads back to the West Course in hopes he learned something from his first 18 holes there on Saturday. \n“The sight lines are different for me out there (West Course), because I’m used to playing tree-lined golf courses that tell you where to hit your shots,” McWilliams said at the North Course No. 9 scoring tent after his round. “Over there, it is not tree-lined and I have to figure out where to start the ball off the tee. It looks huge (at the West Course) off the tee, but it’s not. \n“I made a lot of mental mistakes Saturday, hitting driver when I should have hit 3-wood, and hitting 3-wood when I should have hit driver. I learned a lot, in that you want to stay below the hole and out of the rough. You get in that rough and you just have to take out a 9-iron and chop it up toward the green.” \nSTROKE PLAY CONTINUES \nA rain delay of 1 hour, 6 minutes meant the second round of stroke play wasn’t completed as planned Sunday. \nPlay was stopped with 59 players — 35 on the West Course, 24 on the North — who haven’t completed their second rounds of stroke play at John’s Island Club. Golf will resume Monday morning at 7:30. There’s expected to be a playoff to reach 64 players and the first round of match play will start afterward. \nFour-time Mid-Amateur champion Nathan Smith made four birdies on his back nine, but he won’t know his fate until Monday. Smith was at 1-over 73 and was tied for 67th. His best hope is to get into a playoff if at least three players in front of him make some bogeys. \n“I hope I’m out here (Monday),” Smith said. “It could be a long day or it could be a short day. I’ve always made match play. It seemed like a real grind. If I hit a good drive, it would be a mud ball or it would land in a sand divot.” \nMatt Parziale, a former golf pro from Brockton, Mass., who is now a firefighter, shot a 3-under 69 at the West Course and is the leader in the clubhouse at 4-under 139. Defending champion Scott Harvey also is at 4-under, but he faces a 4-foot par putt on his 17th hole of the North Course. \nParziale tried to go through the PGA Tour’s Q-school three times, but he decided two years ago to follow his father’s path of being a firefighter. \n“I have no regrets,” Parziale said. “I didn’t want to lose the opportunity to be a firefighter. I love what I do.” \nHe is the Massachusetts Golf Association’s reigning Player of the Year. \nUSGA PRAISES JOHN'S ISLAND CLUB \nExcept for the weather delay, the USGA has been thrilled with the hosting of the U.S. Mid-Amateur by John’s Island Club. \n“I love the atmosphere around this place,” said Bill McCarthy, who runs the championship for the USGA. “It doesn’t feel like you’re in Florida. It feels like you’re somewhere in the Northeast. They’ve done a great job.” \nJohn’s Island member Mark Mulvoy, the tournament chairman, downplayed the effects of the delay. \n“This will only cost us an hour or so (Monday),” he said. “They will start sending out some of the matches that are decided while the playoff is going on.” \nIf there is a playoff, it will start on the 13th hole of the West Course and continue to the 14th, 15th and 18th holes, if needed. \nThe logistics of running the event are simplified when the field of 264 players is reduced to 64 for match play. \n“There’s a big decompression,” McCarthy said. \nCraig Dolch contributed to this report.
