That’s what we had to do — not worry about anything else.”\nLund finished with a match-high 27 kills to lead the Tologs, who have won 11 of 13 matches dating back to Oct. 1.\n“It came down to who got those rally points,” Lund said. “We knew it was going to be a tough match. We had to get those extra points, points on long rallies.”\nFlintridge Sacred Heart showed grit and determination when it had to.\nThe Tologs won a tight set three and were trailing 20-15 in the fourth before mounting a tremendous comeback.\n“We were good all-around and our middles really stepped up,” Lund said.\nFlintridge Sacred Heart coach Ernest Banaag was more than pleased.\n“I have to give credit to the girls,” Banaag said. “They not only followed the game plan, they didn’t relive the past. They were in control, had a good attitude and learned to win tonight. They stayed the course, didn’t get too up and didn’t get too down. We just tried to make it difficult for them. Our offense came alive and we made them have to work.”\nLund had plenty of help from her teammates in a solid, balanced effort.\nEllis DeJardin and Ali McCollum each had 13 kills.\nDeJardin’s ace ended the match one play after Clare Lund put home a kill to break a 24-24 tie.\nClare Lund finished with 61 assists but was humble in victory.\n“It’s easy to do that when you get great passes to set and hitters to put away balls,” she said. “It was awesome to see us play together, get some key kills, some key passes and keep our serves in.”\nFlintridge Sacred Heart moved to within one game of Marymount in the league standings with three to play.\n“We came together after the Harvard-Westlake loss and told each other it’s time to live up to our expectations,” Clare Lund said.\nAdvertisement\nKayla Lund added: “Our two league losses were a wake-up call. Our practice drills have changed, our mindset has changed. We come out on the court different now. We are definitely playing together.”", "external_links": ["http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:42:34.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
