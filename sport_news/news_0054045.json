Jeff Samardzija didn’t make it any easier Tuesday night. \nEric Hosmer and Kendrys Morales hit back-to-back homers and Johnny Cueto threw six quality innings, but the Royals lost to Samardzija and the Chicago White Sox 4-2. \nThe Royals, who have lost four of their last five, fell behind 3-0 after Adam Eaton drove a two-run homer into the bullpen in right field off Cueto (10-13) in the fifth inning. \nCueto lost for the third time in his four September outings and gave up three runs and eight hits over six innings. He struck out two and walked two. \nStill a Royals offense that hadn’t scored in 17 innings during a three-game stretch that included Kansas City being shut out 1-0 in 11 innings by the Chicago Cubs on Monday night, didn’t do much to help Cueto — or the Royals. \nTuesday’s loss dropped the AL Central champions to 10-17 in September. After beginning the month with a 6 1/2 game lead over Toronto for the best record in the AL, the Royals now trail the Blue Jays by 1 1/2 games with five games remaining in the regular season. \nAsked if he’s starting to fight the urge to try and do something to snap out of it, Royals manager Ned Yost said, “Maybe a little bit, but we’re not quite there yet.” \nHe added, “We’re fighting it a little bit.” \nKansas City got within 3-2 in the sixth when Hosmer and Morales homered off Samardzija (11-13), who won for the second straight time after losing nine of his 10 previous outings. \nComing off a complete-game one hitter against Detroit on Sept. 21, Samardzija scattered eight hits over seven innings to pick up the win, striking out two. The consecutive homers — Kansas City’s first since July 25, 2014 — snapped Samardzija’s string of 14 scoreless innings. \nThe solo homers didn’t rattle Samardzija.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:10:46.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
