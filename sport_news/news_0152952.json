The left back featured for 77 minutes in a left midfield role and grabbed what proved to be the game’s winner with his 48 minute striker after team mate Jamie Vardy had put the foxes ahead via the penalty spot. Schlupp featured in midfield after Algerian Star man Riyhad Mahrez was mysteriously left out on the bench and his performance was a delight to watch before being substituted by Andy King. \nJORDAN AYEW: \nThe Villa forward just like his team are still trying to find their feet in the league after a major summer overhaul. The former Lorient man was substituted in on the 58th minute mark for English winger Scott Sinclair as his side went searching for the equalizer against Mark Hughes’ Stoke City. Jordan huffed and puffed but his efforts were not enough as his side were unable to overturn the deficit. Villa are still searching for a win after their opening day victory over Christian Atsu’s Bournemouth. \nCHRISTIAN ATSU : \nAtsu is yet to make his Premiership debut for Eddie Howe’s side despite having a good pre-season with the side. He was not named in the match squad yet again as Bournemouth were held to a draw by newly promoted Watford. Atsu, just like many Ghanaians will be wondering what he can do right to enter into Howe’s plans. Many felt Ivory Coast Max Gradel’s unfortunate injury will be a blessing in disguise for the former Porto man but he has been overlooked time and again. Nigerian Igalho once again was on the scoresheet equalizing for Warford after Glenn Murray had taken the lead for Bournemouth. \nBABA RAHMAN \nJust like Atsu, Rahman will be wondering what he can do right to make his Premiership debut for the Blues. Despite being constantly bashed as the weak spot in the team, Branislav Ivanovic continues to be deployed as right back while Spaniard Cesar Azpilicueta continues at left back at the expense of Baba Rahman. On Saturday, he sat on the bench for ninety minutes as he watched his side go down 3-1 at home to Southampton putting more pressure on his side. His coach in a press conference earlier stated Rahman is not ready for Premiership soccer, but for how long will this remain? \n- \nFollow Kweku on Twitter: @nana_odum.
