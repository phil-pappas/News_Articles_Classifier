The restaurant will be open Tuesday through Friday and will serve dishes aimed to pair well with their beer offerings.\n“[Jack’s Abby owners] tasked Chef Gregg Bergeron with creating a menu that would pair well with lots and lots of beer,” Jack’s Abby representative Sarah McGinley said. “What he created is a menu that features wood-fired pizza, inspired comfort-food options, and plates with a German flair. You can find a clam and bacon pizza, braised beef goulash cooked with our Smoke Dagger [Black Lager], four-cheese mac and cheese, and bratwurst with spaetzel all on the same menu.”\nMediaBoss Television of Framingham The new space is about five times larger than Jack’s Abby’s previous digs, and focal points of the location include a copper-cased wood-fired pizza oven and a tapline that accommodates 24 unique brews.\nThe new kitchen and taproom are joined by a complete company rebranding.
