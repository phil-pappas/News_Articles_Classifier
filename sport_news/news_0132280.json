It is not easy to play here in these conditions and the cold,” Rakitic told reporters. \n“I think it was (our most complete game this season) as we were solid at the back and gave away few chances, while in attack we worked hard and maybe just lacked another goal. We are on the right lines.” \nBarca have seven points from three games and BATE have three. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:38:19.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
