That’s what I’ve learned from the last couple of days and I think it was a positive way to start,” he said. \nAllardyce takes over a Sunderland side he briefly played for in the early 1980s, currently propping up the standings with north-east rivals Newcastle United, the only teams without a league win this season. \nThe man known as “Big Sam” has been out of management since leaving West Ham United at the end of last season and begins his latest stint in the hot seat with a trip to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday (1400). \n“We have to try and install a little bit more confidence in the team,” he said of a side who have amassed just three points from eight games. \nLast season’s champions Chelsea find themselves just three places above Sunderland in 16 th and owner Roman Abramovich was moved to publicly back manager Jose Mourinho after their fourth league loss of the season against Southampton. \nChelsea host fellow strugglers Aston Villa on Saturday (1400) in desperate need of three points after their horror start which has yielded only two wins. \nLeaders Manchester City host Bournemouth on Saturday (1400), the first meeting between the clubs in 16 years. \nCity are two points ahead of Arsenal, who are away at Watford (1630) while Manchester United, level with the Londoners on 16 points, make the trip to Goodison Park to play seventh-placed Everton (1400). — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:43:26.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
