Matt Reagan and Chad Irvine made sure B-R stayed on the winning track by scoring two touchdowns each and led Bridgewater-Raynham (3-3, 2-0 Old Colony League) to a 48-24 victory over Barnstable (1-5, 0-1) at B-R on Friday night. Barnstable struck first when quarterback Bryce Conroy found tight end Will O’Day for a 37-yard touchdown, giving Barnstable an 8-0 lead with 3:52 left in the first quarter. Bridgewater-Raynham answered back later in the quarter when Jensen Vallarelli ran it in for a touchdown, cutting the Barnstable lead to 8-7 with 10:53 left in the opening quarter. Barnstable was driving in the second quarter when the B-R defense stood tall on a fourth-and-one stop by Bryce Shaw to force a turnover on downs. B-R was then driving deep into Red Raider territory when Barnstable recovered a Trojan fumble. From there, Conroy found Nate Balthazard for a 37-yard touchdown pass, making it 15-7. The Trojans once again answered when Vallarelli ran for a 17-yard touchdown, cutting the Red Raiders’ lead to 15-14 with 2:54 left in the first half. The Trojans pounced on a fumble on the kickoff return by Barnstable, taking over at the 27. D’Emilia found Matt Reagan for a 27-yard touchdown, giving B-R a 20-16 lead with 2:30 left in the half. B-R struck again before halftime as D’Emilia found Reagan for his second touchdown of the day – a 30-yard touchdown – making it 27-16 at the break. Kyle Johnston and Trevor McMasters led the charge defensively for the Trojans. The Trojans kept the momentum going in the second half as Chad Irvine rumbled for a 38-yard touchdown run, increasing the B-R lead to 34-16 with 10:27 left in the third quarter. Irvine added a 36-yard touchdown run later in the quarter. Alex Smith scored in the fourth, extending the lead to 48-16.
