A bad outing for a pitcher that would be filed and forgotten in June is taken as a possible sign of folding under pressure in October. If a hitter goes through a bad stretch in the regular season he’s just in a slump, but if he does it in the playoffs, the whispers start: Could it be that he can’t handle the big stage?\nMost of this is nonsense, of course, because baseball is a game that should be assessed in big gulps, not small bites. Occasionally someone reminds us of that, as when Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw , who hadn’t had nearly the postseason success that one would expect of a pitcher with three Cy Young Awards, shut down the Mets for seven innings in their playoff series last week in an elimination game for the Dodgers. Suddenly it seemed so silly, this idea that players who perform at a high level for six months suddenly get the yips in the cauldron of October.\nFor six innings on Saturday, it appeared that Blue Jays starter David Price , another Cy Young winner with a similarly poor postseason history, was going to duplicate Kershaw’s accomplishment, if not exceed it. Price was nearly flawless against the Kansas City Royals in Game 2 of their American League Championship Series, allowing a leadoff hit to Alcides Escobar before retiring the next 18 consecutive batters.\n“He had it going on,” said Jays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki . “I mean, he was sailing.”\nBut in the seventh, whatever postseason gremlins have dogged Price in the past got to him again.\nMLB Video Royals come from behind to defeat Blue Jays in Game 2 of ALCS by Cliff Corcoran", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/SI_PhilTaylor"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:54:29.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
