If Julien has always had a basic core principle that sound defense has to be a key foundation of a team — and any coach who doesn’t share that belief is in the wrong line of work — he’s never been one of those coaches who teaches the same X’s and O’s year after tedious year.\nThroughout his nine seasons behind the Bruins bench, the 55-year-old Julien has demonstrated not just a willingness but a desire to make changes.\nJulien showed that flexibility and the instincts of a survivor this summer, after general manager Peter Chiarelli was fired and Don Sweeney stepped into the job. For three weeks, it wasn’t clear whether Julien would be brought back.\nHe had previously been mostly answerable only to Chiarelli, but now the coach had a new power structure above him, and Sweeney and club president Cam Neely were adamant that the B’s open up and play a faster, more offensive brand of hockey.\nCould Julien adjust and give them what they wanted? Well, when he and Sweeney talked things over they realized they could work together just fine.\nTheir accord became very evident at the NHL entry draft, when Julien went out of his way to voice support for Sweeney.\n“First of all,” said Julien, “I think you’ve got to give Donny a lot of credit. He’s come into this role and there was a lot on his plate and a lot going on, some tough decisions to be made.\n“Personally, I’m pretty impressed with how he’s handled it. That’s not to say I’m happy that Dougie Hamilton and Milan Lucic are gone. Those are two pretty good players. But those were moves that probably had to be made with the situation we’re in with the cap and everything else. They decided to make some decisions regarding the future of the Bruins. They had to make those decisions.\n“I’m a coach who likes to have the support of upper management, so I’m going to be supporting upper management on those.\n“I’m the coach here and I’m going to take whatever player we have — and there’s obviously going to be some new faces — and we’re going to make it work. I’m not looking at this as we’re rebuilding, not at all. We’re going to go out there to be a real competitive team.”\nNow that his buddy, Mike Babcock, has jumped from Detroit to Toronto, Julien has the longest current tenure with the same team. He is also believed to be the fourth highest-paid coach in the league, pulling down some $2.5 million-per-year for two more years.\nJulien has a record of 470-278-112 behind the benches of the Bruins, Devils and Canadiens. His mark in Boston is 351-192-79, leaving him 36 wins behind Art Ross, the skipper for 16 seasons from the mid-1920s to mid-1940s.\nThirty-six wins should be very attainable for Julien this year — assuming he sticks around all season. Whether or not that will be the case could depend on the team’s start. The B’s brass has created the uncertainty on his job security. Neely understands why there’s a belief that the coach is on shaky ground.\n“I get why there’s that perception,” said Neely last week. “After Don was hired it was a while before there was a decision. Don had to feel comfortable and go through some conversations he felt he needed to go through with Claude.\n“But I think it’s unfair to start a season off where there’s already conversations that’s he’s on the hot seat. A lot of things can happen where it’s not necessarily the coach (at fault). We’ve got a number of new players who have to learn the way we’d like them to play.”\nFans better hope Julien and his players get it figured out in a hurry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:46:17.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
