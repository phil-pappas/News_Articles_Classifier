They were in that game against the Patriots for 43 minutes and 46 seconds. And then, inexplicably. the worst trick play in the history of mankind unfolded in the sort of slow-motion train wreck usually reserved for the Browns or Redskins or Lions . \nThe Colts tried a unique formation on 4th down. It didn't work. #NEvsIND http://t.co/Eh0HXpFV00 — NFL (@NFL) October 19, 2015 \nAt the time, the Colts trailed the Patriots 27-21 with 1:14 left in the third quarter. And instead of punting on 4th-and-3 from their own 37, they tried to match wits with the evil genius and it blew up in their face, on national television no less. \nAfterwards, Colts coach Chuck Pagano, who somehow finds himself on the hot seat despite winning 11 games in each of his first three seasons, tried to explain what happened . \n“The punt play, again I take responsibility there,” he told reporters. “The whole idea there was, on a 4th-and-3 or less, shift (our) alignment to where you either catch them misaligned, they try to sub some people in, catch them with more men on the field, 12 men on the field. And if you get a certain look, you've got three yards, two yards — you can make a play. \n“But again, we shifted over, and I didn't do a good enough job of coaching it during the week. Alignment-wise, we weren't lined up correctly, and then a communication breakdown between the quarterback and the snapper. And that's all on me. I take full responsibility on that, and I didn't do a good enough job of getting that communicated to the guys. And obviously, it played a huge factor in this loss, given the field position and the point in the game and the touchdown that resulted from that.” \nPro Bowler Pat McAfee , who uncorked a 56-yard punt earlier in the evening, also tried to shed some light on what was supposed to happen . \n\"We started working that play last year and then we put it back in this week,\" he said. \"It's a play where you try to take advantage of numbers, try to confuse the defense and hopefully get an edge, numbers-wise. The look was not there that we normally have in practice where it's a go. There must've been some miscommunication between the snapper ( Griff Whalen ) and Colt (Anderson).\" \nIn the other locker room, Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman offered this on the failed fake punt: They did that,\" he told Yahoo.com 's Dan Wetzel. \"You know, Colts.\" \nThere are no words for what happened next.
