Lawrence Academy rebounded from that loss to run the table and win the Hugh Caldera Bowl.\nMany of the players return for the Spartans, including running back A.J. Dillon, quarterback Jake Cassidy, Brown-bound wide receiver Demetri Jackson and key linemen Eddy Fish and Finn Dirstine. Dillon comes off a 320-yard, five-touchdown effort in a season-opening 55-30 victory over Cheshire Academy.\n“(Dillon) is the best back I’ve seen in a while,” said Governor’s Academy coach Jim O’Leary. “He’s a big kid (230 pounds) who is strong and fast.”\nGovernor’s Academy flexed some offensive muscle in its first game, rallying to defeat Williston Northampton, 40-30. Cam Macri, who rushed for three scores, teams with Ryan Day to form one of the top backfield tandems in the ISL.\nSeth Harrell runs the show at quarterback and his top target is Zach Coffey. The line is keyed a pair of returning ISL All-Stars in Jacob Palmer and Brian Fraga.\nElsewhere tomorrow, Everett looks to avoid a 1-3 start for the first time in two decades when it hosts Central Catholic . Malden Catholic , 3-0 for the first time in 1996, faces its biggest challenge when it travels to No. 2 St. John’s Prep .\nCardinal Spellman faces Austin Prep at North Reading High School, while Milton Academy visits Brooks .\nWeather permitting this evening, several key league contests highlight the slate. The marque matchup takes place in Tewksbury where the Redmen square off against Andover in a Merrimack Valley Conference Large showdown.\nDefending Division 4 champion Holliston takes to the road to meet its Thanksgiving Day rival Westwood in a Tri-Valley Large tilt, while Watertown and Melrose battle for the top spot in the Middlesex Freedom in Melrose. Two more battles worth watching are Archbishop Williams at Bishop Fenwick and Foxboro at Canton .\nAmong the premier nonleague contests are Brockton at BC High and Marshfield at Bridgewater-Raynham .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:22:46.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
