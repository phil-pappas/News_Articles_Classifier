YK Mishra, general manager, pollution control unit Pey Jal Nigam, today said he was aware that the STP treatment plant at Uttarkashi was in need of a major repair, as three pumps out of two were not working efficiently and he had directed officials to restart the plant manually within two weeks. He also said the old contractor who was assigned the work to run the plant had been removed from the service for his fraudulent activities and the process to appoint new one was in progress. The efforts are also being made to employ more people for the smooth functioning of the plant. Medicines have also been released so that the area is made safe from contamination. Mishra assured that the STP plant would become operational from December 15. Presently, operator Mahesh Rawat is handling all chores at the plant and is awaiting his salary since April 2012. Residents of the area are of the view that idle STP plant and untreated sewage is still flowing into the Ganga.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:20:44.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
