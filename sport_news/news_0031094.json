(AP) - Freshman Lorenzo Nunez’s shoulder injury has led to the latest quarterback switch for South Carolina and coach Steve Spurrier. \nSpurrier said Thursday former walk-on Perry Orth will start against No. 7 LSU on Saturday because Nunez had not practiced much this week after injuring his shoulder at Missouri. \nOrth, a junior, started at Georgia three weeks ago in a 52-20 loss. Nunez took over the following week and also started in a loss at Missouri. \nConnor Mitch, who began the season as the starter, remains out with a separated shoulder he sustained in a loss to Kentucky last month. \nThe Gamecocks (2-3, 0-3 Southeastern Conference) had their home game with LSU (4-0, 2-0) shifted to Louisiana because of flooding in South Carolina. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:03:39.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
