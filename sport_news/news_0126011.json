Instead it was a less-than-stellar effort against a Terps defense that got good penetration for a good portion of the day and held Ezekiel Elliott to 29 yards on 12 first-half carries. A team supposedly ready to fire its head coach should not be causing as much trouble as it did Since the start of the 2014 season, four of Maryland's five Big Ten losses before Saturday were blowouts. \nGRADE: C \nRUNNING GAME \nEzekiel Elliott's streak of 100-yard games, now at 11, was in serious jeopardy at halftime, but that always seems to be the case. The Buckeyes got more from Braxton Miller in the passing attack, but he's still not much of a threat as a runner. Those direct snaps are just too unpredictable. Inserting J.T. Barrett as the red zone specialist provided a much-needed spark, while also fanning the flames of quarterback controversy. It's nice to see the Buckeyes put some read-option back into the attack, but they're doing it with the wrong guy. Cardale Jones has had enough trouble running a pro-style offense. \nGRADE: B minus \nPASSING GAME \nIf inserting J.T. Barrett as a red zone specialist was meant to light a fire under starter Cardale Jones, it seemed to work. Jones came back after Barrett finished two TD drives to throw scoring strikes of 19 yards to Braxton Miller and 48 yards to Jalin Marshall. OSU fans may have seen a first when the Buckeyes used three QBs, including Miller, on the same series. Good thing they scored or OSU might have tried four on the next possession. When Marshall got behind the secondary on his TD grab, it was a good thing Jones laid it in there after Marshall and coach Urban Meyer essentially called him out for underthrowing balls two weeks ago. \nGRADE: B plus \nDEFENSIVE LINE \nOK, Joey Bosa may have carried it too far on the roughing call that kept Maryland's game-tying scoring drive alive, but it was good to see more of him collapsing the pocket on Saturday. Or not a good thing, given that QB Perry Hills was at his best when scrambling. Bosa got his first solo sack of the year, but he deemed it worthy of only a mini-shrug, his signature sack celebration. A mini-shrug was probably what the entire defense deserved Saturday. Tyquan Lewis (two sacks Saturday and team-high 5.5 for the season) has benefited from the extra attention paid Bosa, Adolphus Washington's stock continues to rise at tackle and freshman end Sam Hubbard had an athletic pick. But there's still plenty of room for improvement by the entire unit after giving up four touchdowns to one of the worst offenses in the Big Ten. \nGRADE: C \nLINEBACKERS \nThe more we see of Raekwon McMillan at middle linebacker, it's harder to explain why Curtis Grant was getting any starter snaps last season, especially when you consider that McMillan is going to be a three-and-done player. The only thing missing from his game to take him to the elite level is more impact plays and they should come. Remember Andy Katzenmoyer's freshman year, when he had 12 sacks and 23 tackles for loss? Or the season James Laurinatis had five interceptions? It will be fun to see if McMillan develops into that kind of middle linebacker. The biggest knock against the back seven Saturday was giving up a 75-yard run by quarterback Perry Hills, setting up his own short TD. It recalled the 79-yard TD run by Indiana's backup QB Zander Diamont one week earlier. \nGRADE: C plus \nDEFENSIVE BACKS \nThe most glaring mistake by the secondary was that busted play early in the game, resulting in a 52-yard TD pass to ridiculously open D.J. Moore. Because of the pressure up front, quarterback Perry Hills was reduced to nothing more than a running threat. So where were the Buckeyes when Hills set sail up the middle on his 75-yard jaunt? Tyvis Powell had the backfield's only takeaway with his interception and it was late in the game when the Terps were in desperation mode. \nGRADE: B \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nJalin Marshall continues to impress as a punt returner, not just with his breakaway ability but his smarts on staying away from bouncing balls he would have tried to pick up in traffic last season. His 28-yard return gave the Buckeyes a short field on a second quarter TD. Cameron Johnston did nothing to tarnish his reputation as one of the nation's best punters, booming one 65 yards and dropping two inside the 20. Field goal kicking, however, is quickly becoming a concern. Duke transfer Jack Willoughby beat out last year's kicker, Sean Nuernberger, but his miss from 44 yards makes him 0-for-3 from beyond 40 yards, and his longest is only 31. Maryland's punt return dynamo William Likely had a 28-yard return, but wasn't able to get into the end zone for a third time this season. \nGRADE: B \nCOACHING \nUrban Meyer's decision to use J.T. Barrett as a red zone specialist obviously helped win the game, leading to six touchdowns in six opportunities — five of those with Barrett at the controls — after the Buckeyes came in with only 6 TDs in 16 trips inside the 20. But the move does nothing to quell any simmering quarterback controversy. We're going to have to trust Meyer knows what he's doing. As for the defense, Luke Fickell needs to come up with a better solution for stopping mobile quarterbacks. \nGRADE: B 3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1RAfofZ More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:24:38.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
