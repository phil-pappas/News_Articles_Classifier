Get ready for Season 6, in which Oregon's Todd Hoffman, whippersnapper Parker Schnabel, and Tony \"What did he say?\" Beets find even more of the yellow stuff.\nI talked to Dave Turin, who lives in Welches, Oregon, and has been Hoffman's get-it-done guy, and \"Gold Rush\" executive producer Christo Doyle about what to expect in Season 6.\n\"This season, we have double the amount of gold,\" Doyle told me in a phone interview. \"Not only do we have gold, which the viewers always love, we have a lot of drama.\"\nOf Hoffman, Doyle says: \"He is an incredibly smart man. You may not know that by some of his mining decisions, but he's an incredibly smart guy, and incredibly dynamic. We look for larger-than-life personalities, and he definitely has that.\"\nTurin says that while Hoffman may not be the most practical-minded gold miner, \"he's really great at putting deals together. Which I'm not. I'm too easy. We complement each other. We've become very, very good friends.\"\nRead my story to get more intel from Doyle and Turin about what to expect in the new season, from Hoffman, Schnabel and Beets.\nWe know that Hoffman, who lives in Sandy, Oregon, when he's not way up yonder looking for gold, is joined again by his father, Jack, and that Hoffman's son, 16-year-old Hunter, will be getting more camera time this season.\nWhat: The two-hour \"Gold Rush\" Season 6 premiere\nWhen: 9 p.m. Friday, Oct. 16, on Discovery Channel\nPlus: At 8 p.m., the behind-the-scenes companion show, \"The Dirt,\" begins its season, with new host Matt Rogers.\n-- Kristi Turnquist\nkturnquist@oregonian.com\n503-221-8227\n@Kristiturnquist", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChristoDoyle?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author", "https://twitter.com/kristiturnquist", "http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/gold-rush/", "http://www.discovery.com/embed?page=189445", "http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/gold-rush/bios/dave-turin/"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:02:47.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
