Comment By Phil Ricciuti/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By Phil Ricciuti/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 9:30 PM By Phil Ricciuti/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 9:30 PM SUDBURY — They had the same league record heading into Tuesday afternoon’s contest and were tied atop the Dual County League’s Large Division standings. And well into the second half they had each scored one goal. But eventually there was some separation between the Lincoln-Sudbury and Concord-Carlisle boys soccer teams in their second meeting of the season. With 16:29 showing on the clock, C-C senior midfielder Thomas Ratcliffe got his head on a loose ball in front of the L-S net and headed it past the outstretched arms of L-S goalkeeper Robert Hurstak for a 2-1 Patriots lead. The Warriors never could respond, and the game ended with that same score. L-S, which had beaten C-C 1-0 earlier in the season, falls to 6-2-3 in the DCL Large with the loss, while the Patriots improve to 7-2-2. “It’s always a battle with C-C,” L-S coach David Hosford said. “It was a game that shows us where we should be and it shows that we still have a lot of work to do, and if you don’t bring your ‘A’ game against C-C they know how to expose all your weaknesses and they did that today.” While it was C-C that ultimately emerged with the victory, it was L-S that jumped out to an almost immediate lead. Less then two minutes into the game, senior Andy Manos took a direct kick and put the ball past Patriots netminder William Palmer for a quick 1-0 lead. “We were lucky to draw a free kick in a great place and I just did what I have been doing in practice and execute and the ball went into the bottom right of the net,” Manos said. C-C had a rapid response. Barely a minute later, the Patriots were awarded a penalty kick when the Warriors committed a hand ball in the penalty zone. Hurstak had just made a leaping save off a high shot that appeared destined to settle into the top of the net. He batted the ball into the air where it was then touched by an L-S defender. Midfielder Cole Easton took the PK and buried it past Hurstak to even the score at 1-1. And that’s where it remained until there were less than 17 minutes remaining and C-C’s Ratcliffe provided the game-winner. “That was a great finish by Thomas in the end to get up and put his body on the line,” C-C coach Ray Pavlik said. “He’s not a big kid and he got up in the air and got over some guys that were a couple of inches taller than him. It was a great play and technically sound.” Page 2 of 2 - While there was a gap of some 60 minutes between goals, both L-S and C-C had chances to break the deadlock before Ratcliffe eventually did so. Palmer and Hurstak, however — as well as the respective defenses of the Patriots and Warriors — were up to the task each time. Even after Ratcliffe’s go-ahead goal L-S had opportunities to equalize. Junior Daniel Sacher hit the crossbar with 11:50 remaining, and two minutes later Palmer made a diving save to barely deflect a shot that was headed straight for the far corner of the net. “(Concord-Carlisle) had the play for a while and then I felt that in the last 10 or 15 minutes we forced their goalie into making some good saves,” Hosford said. “He made a couple of good saves and deflected a shot that could have gone in but went wide.” By Phil Ricciuti/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By Phil Ricciuti/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 9:30 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:55:49.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
