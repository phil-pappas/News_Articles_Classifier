The answer is easy: Yes, he plays.\nIn his first five years in the league, he missed eight games. But that's deceiving, because he was suspended for the first four games in 2012 after failing a NFL drug test. Since his rookie year of 2010, Haden has missed four games due to injury. That counts Sunday's 30-27 loss at San Diego.\nFurthermore, he played 75 percent of the snaps as a rookie. From 2011-15, he's been on the field for 96 percent of the snaps.\nJoe Haden plays. He wants to play. The record indicates that.\nWhen Haden said his broken finger prevented him from playing last Sunday's game, there's reason to believe Haden simply couldn't play. In the Browns' 27-20 loss to Oakland, Haden hurt his ribs on the first play of the game. He still played 93 percent of the snaps that game.\n\"I play hurt all the time,\" Haden told the media. \"Hurt is different than injured. If I'm injured and I feel like I'm going to hurt the team, I'm not going out there.\"\nThat was Haden's decision last week. But lurking behind this story is another story -- the failure of Justin Gilbert to grow into a trustworthy defensive back.\nWHAT PETTINE DID WRONG\nHaden could have done things differently, and the same is true of coach Mike Pettine.\n\"We left it up to Joe and he said he didn't want to go,\" Pettine said on Monday.\nThe coach made it sound as if Haden didn't want to play. He offered little else in the way of an explanation, other than a brief discussion of the finger. Remember, this was said 24 hours after the game ... not 24 minutes following a loss.\nIt's obvious that Pettine was upset with Haden's game-day decision. But it's also true that Pettine has to know Haden's history of playing virtually every snap in nearly every game of his career.\nIt's easier to understand Pettine making that flip statement right after the loss ... rather than a day later. All Pettine had to say was, \"We know Joe wanted to play. He has a history of playing. We support Joe and want him back on the field as fast as possible.\"\nLater, Pettine realized he had messed up. He knew this didn't help him with the other players. It's easy to imagine some wondering why Pettine failed to support his Pro Bowl cornerback.\nTo Pettine's credit, he apologized to Haden, the team and then in the media.\nWHAT HADEN DID WRONG\nBecause it seemed the coaches and the other players expected Haden to play, he should have taken more time to explain to his coaches why he was so concerned about the condition of his finger.\nJoe Haden on his decision not to play last Sunday for the Browns Cleveland Browns cornerback Joe Haden discusses his pre-game decision not to play last Sunday in the loss to the Chargers due to the broken finger, even though he was listed as probable. Dave Andersen, Northeast Ohio Media Group\nHe was listed as \"probable\" before Sunday, yet appeared on the list of inactive players. During the week, the media was not made aware of Haden's broken ring finger on his right hand. The ribs were the concern.\nHaden said he took a painkiller shot and wrapped up the finger to try and play, but believed he'd be forced to cover receivers \"with one hand\" after going through warmups before Sunday's game.\nPerhaps he should have tried to play. If he indeed was limited to playing with one hand, he could have come out. Everyone would have seen that he at least gave it a try. There would have been no discussion.\nBut it's easy to understand why Haden felt conflicted. Because if he knew he couldn't play for long, he would occupy a game-day active spot. Perhaps someone who was inactive could have helped the team.\nI really don't have much of a problem with Haden.\nTHE REAL PROBLEM\nThe Browns were already without top reserve defensive back K'Waun Williams (concussion). The coaches had planned on Haden being available.\n\"I see exactly where they are coming from,\" said Haden. \"They game plan around me and what I am going to do out there on defense. ... Kind of a curveball. ... They knew the whole week that my finger (was injured) ... it was just a lack of communication.\"\nYes, communication was part of the trouble. But the real problem was that they made Justin Gilbert the No. 8 pick in 2014, and they have so little confidence in the cornerback from Oklahoma State.\nPierre Desir started for Haden. The fourth-rounder has ability and promise. He could develop into a starter. Gilbert has been such a disappointment, he played only eight snaps in Sunday's loss.\nThe Browns instead turned to Johnson Bademosi, an undrafted free agent and special teams player. When Bademosi does play, it's usually as a safety. Yet he was being asked to play cornerback instead of Gilbert.\nBademosi played 42 snaps, or 65 percent of the game. He was OK, but that's it.\nHaden's injury, combined with Gilbert's struggles, led to frustration for the defensive coaches. That's why as the frustration bubbled up, it was about more than just Haden. It's about the failure of a top draft pick to be ready when needed.\nIt also points once again to the costly mistake made at the top of the 2014 draft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:16:51.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
