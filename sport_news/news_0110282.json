We came out slow,” Palat said. “They were all over us. We were a little soft, and that can’t happen. I don’t know what’s going on, but we have to fix that. The second and third periods were better.” \nBrayden Coburn, Cedric Paquette and Vladislav Namestnikov all scored for the Lightning (5-2-1). \nNikolaj Ehlers, Drew Stafford and Blake Wheeler had regulation-time goals for the Jets (4-3-0). \nBen Bishop, who recorded his 100th career win on Friday, has started every game for the Lightning this season and moved to 5-2-1 on the year. Ondrej Pavelec picked up his third loss in five starts and sits at 2-3-0. \nTyler Johnson threaded a pass from behind the net to Coburn, who buried his first of the season for a 1-0 Tampa Bay lead. \nWinnipeg tied the game 1-1 when Ehlers tapped home his second of the season after the Jets entered the zone three wide, with Mathieu Perreault feeding Mark Scheifele, who shuffled the puck over to Ehlers 16:28 into the first. \nEhlers came inches from his second of the night and a lead for the Jets, but his shot hit the post. \n“It was a fast game, some really well executed plays for both teams,” said Jets head coach Paul Maurice. “I think both teams were good for a reason. I don’t think through the game one team got worse. One team was good in the first and the third, that was us. They were real good in the second period.” \nTampa Bay restored its one goal advantage 7:23 into the second frame. \nPaquette benefited from the Lightning forcing a Jets turnover, allowing the sophomore to snipe his first of the season top corner over Pavelec’s glove hand. \nThe Jets briefly tied the game at 2-2 through Stafford on a partial breakaway. But 21 seconds later the Lightning struck again as Namestnikov fired home a rebound off a Hedman point shot to restore their one-goal cushion at 11:18. \nWinnipeg found the equalizer once again, this time shorthanded, 1:17 into the third period as Wheeler raced behind the net, stole the puck from Bishop and scored on a wraparound.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:20:18.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
