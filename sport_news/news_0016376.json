A post-war Allied tribunal put the death toll at about half that number.\n\"The (Japanese) government believes there is no denying that some killings of non-combatants and acts of looting took place,\" Suga said. \"But there are various debates on the issue and Japan's stance is that it is difficult to put a finger on specific numbers.\"\nThe dossier, covering the period from Dec. 13, 1937 to early 1938, includes court documents from the Allied tribunal and a separate Chinese military tribunal, as well as photographs said to be taken by the Japanese army and film taken by an American missionary.\nChina has welcomed UNESCO's decision.\n\"The Nanjing Massacre is a severe crime committed by Japanese militarism during World War II and is a historical fact recognised by the international community,\" China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday.\n\"Facts should not be denied and history not re-written.\"\nSome Japanese conservatives periodically say that accounts of the massacre are a fabrication or exaggerated.\nSino-Japanese ties have also been frayed by territorial rows and mutual mistrust over China's growing military assertiveness, as well as Japan's bolder security stance, although relations have thawed somewhat recently. China's top diplomat was in Japan on Tuesday for high-level political talks.
