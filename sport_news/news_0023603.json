He also was still grieving over the death of his son, former Delaware Attorney Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in May.\nWednesday's announcement was a letdown for Biden supporters who had pleaded with him to run, and in increasingly loud tones as his deliberations dragged on through the summer and into the fall.\nFor months, the 72-year-old Democrat made front pages and appeared on cable news screens as pundits mused about his prospects and Clinton's perceived vulnerability.\nA super political action committee, Draft Biden, formed with the explicit goal of getting him into the race.\nAt the White House, aides and longtime Biden loyalists had prepared for his potential bid, putting together a campaign-in-waiting ready to move fast should he decide to jump into the race.\nLast week one of those aides, former Sen. Ted Kaufman, wrote an email to former Biden staffers laying out the potential rationale for a Biden run and promising a decision soon.\nBiden and his team had lined up potential staff and enlisted donors willing to help; Biden spoke personally to many supporters.\nAs speculation about his plans reached a fever pitch, Biden kept up an intense schedule of public appearances, seemingly testing his own stamina for an exhausting presidential campaign.\nBut as speculation swirled, Biden broadcast his reluctance to run amid doubts that he and his family were emotionally ready in the wake of Beau Biden's death.\nIn a September appearance on \"The Late Show,\" Biden told comedian Stephen Colbert he was still experiencing moments of uncontrollable grief that he deemed unacceptable for a presidential aspirant. \"Sometimes it just overwhelms you,\" he said, foreshadowing his ultimate decision.\nBiden would have faced substantial logistically challenges in deciding to mount a campaign this late in the primary process.\nBoth Clinton and Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders have been in the race since April â€” giving them a powerful head start in fundraising, volunteers, endorsements and voter outreach.\nDemocratic operatives and donors already committed to Clinton would likely have had to defect to Biden in order for him to have viable shot at the nomination.\nHaving decided against a final presidential campaign, Biden now approaches the end of his long career in politics.\nA month after being elected to the Senate in 1972 at age 29, Biden's wife and baby daughter died when their car collided with a tractor-trailer. Biden considered relinquishing his seat, but instead was sworn in at the hospital where his sons, Beau and Hunter, were recovering.\nOver six terms in the Senate, he rose in the ranks to become chairman of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees, developing broad expertise in global affairs and reputation for a plainspoken, unpredictable approach to politics.\nBiden twice ran for president. His most recent attempt in 2008 ended after he garnered less than 1 percent in the Iowa caucuses. His first run in 1987 ended even quicker, following allegations he plagiarized in some speeches from a British politician.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:37:50.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
