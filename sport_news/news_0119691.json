FREMANTLE has wasted little time in replacing outgoing assistants Brett Kirk and Simon Lloyd, adding three premiership players to its coaching staff. Former Hawthorn pair Brent Guerra and David Hale - who were both part of the side that beat the Dockers in the 2013 Grand Final - will head west, along with former Kangaroo Anthony Rock. Hale retired just over a fortnight ago, while Guerra and Rock have dipped their toe in the coaching water in various roles since ending their playing days. Dockers football operations manager Chris Bond said the club was thrilled to add the trio’s football experience to its staff. “David, Brent and Anthony each have key football and coaching qualities, and will be valuable additions to our club,” he said. “They have decades of experience at the game’s most elite level and we look forward to them joining our coaching team and the valuable input they will have at the club.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:05:30.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
