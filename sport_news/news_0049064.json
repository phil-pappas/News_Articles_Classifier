But after bringing down yet another college program, it’s true. Brown is bad news for the college game, and it’s time for him to go.\nThis time, for good.\nRELATED: NCAA hits SMU, Larry Brown hard with sanctions\nWhen SMU was slapped with NCAA sanctions Tuesday morning, it improved Brown’s record to 3-for-3. Three times he’s been a head coach in college, and all three times his schools have been hit hard by NCAA violations.\nSMU will lose scholarships and have restrictions on recruiting after it was found to have committed multiple rules violations, including academic fraud and unethical conduct. Seems a former basketball administrator helped former McDonald’s All-American Keith Frazier do schoolwork that allowed him to be eligible at SMU.\nBut the biggest penalty is a postseason ban on a team that was expected to make a deep run in the NCAA tournament. To say nothing of the hit SMU’s reputation is going to take, just as people had finally begun to think of the Mustangs as something other than the NCAA’s poster child for bad behavior.\nAnd to think, SMU actually got off easy.\nIn 1981, UCLA, Brown’s first college stop, had to vacate a Final Four appearance after the Bruins were caught using ineligible players. Nearly seven years later, Kansas became the first school not allowed to defend its national title after it was found to have committed several recruiting violations, including Brown’s “handouts” to a potential transfer.\nNow, the NCAA didn’t find Brown had any direct knowledge of the academic misconduct but that doesn’t matter. As the head coach, he’s in charge of – and responsible for – everything that goes on under his watch and he, of all people, should have known that.\n—“I now realize that every time you are investigated by the NCAA, it's a big deal,” Brown said way back in 1988, after Kansas got busted.\nBrown is a Hall of Famer who has won most everywhere he’s been, and it’s easy to see why SMU was so infatuated with him. He needed all of two seasons to make the Mustangs relevant, three to get them into the NCAA tournament for the first time in 20-plus years.\nBut with Brown, success comes with a heavy price. Too heavy for any college program to pay.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://api.ooyala.com/syndication/mp4?id=78124fe4-69e0-4264-94c3-7cd05c8b729b&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeVL2e.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAeadnv&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;CBS", "http://api.ooyala.com/syndication/redirect?embed_code=pxeXd0dzoD0A_4MYASDVqO6nVT2gSKOe&type=mp4&id=cded7a3a-f48e-4a05-a102-81257a1d5ddd&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;Campus", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeVSE8.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAyrb0&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1tos2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;SMU", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;sports_news&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&q", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeSVrt.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeVhCw.img&quot;}}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:53:35.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
