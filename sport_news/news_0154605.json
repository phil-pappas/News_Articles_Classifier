But in the quarter-finals, the Indian duo found it tough against the Japanese pair of Masataka Morizono and Yuya Oshima as the latter won 3-1 (11-3, 11-5, 10-12, 12-10) to stop Indian progress.\nThe other Indian pair of Sathiyan and Shetty failed to cross the pre-quarterfinal hurdle as they could not sustain the 3-0 (11-8, 14-12, 11-3) onslaught by Japan's Koki Niwa and Maharu Yoshimura, another top pair. Earlier, the Indian beat Turkmenistan's Rashid Ahmedov and Denis Kuzmenko 11-0, 11-0, 11-0 and followed it up with a win over another Saudi pair of Abdulaziz Al-Abbad and Naif Al-Jadai 13-11, 11-6, 11-7 to enter the pre-quarters.
