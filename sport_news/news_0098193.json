Avon police confirm alcohol was involved and Manziel admitted to having two drinks earlier in the day, but an officer did not notice any slurred speech or impairment. \nPer the police report, Manziel and his girlfriend, Colleen Elizabeth Crowley were in downtown Cleveland drinking earlier in the day, and had plans to go see a movie together. When he decided he wanted to pick up a friend also, this upset Crowley. Upset with the change in plans, Crowley wanted to head back to Avon. Manziel stated that he began heading home and while on IR 90, he had Crowley's cell phone on his lap and was using it to control the music. During the ride, Crowley began accusing him of \"driving bad'\". He then stated that Crowley grabbed his wallet, which was in the center divider and threw it out the window. Manziel then stopped his vehicle and turned around in order to look for the wallet. After parking, he stated that \"She did try to get out of the car\". He then admitted to \"trying to grab her arm to keep her from 'riding' out of the car.\" Manziel was asked if at any point there was any striking, punching of pulling of hair, in which Manziel responded, \"No.\"\nCrowley suffered a friction burn to her wrist per the report. \nPolice say based on statements and lack of physical evidence and both parties were drinking and neither wanted to press charges, no arrest was made. The couple left the station together. \nStatement from Browns General Manager Ray Farmer on incident involving Johnny Manziel: \n\"We were aware of the situation. It is a matter that we take seriously and have express our concerns to Johnny directly. Those conversations will remain private and we will refrain from further comment at this time.\" \nCopyright 2015   WOIO .
