Jon will be entering his third season with the Storm.

He will be an outstanding returning role model for the rookies on the team this year. General Manager Tyler Pederson stated, \"Happy to have Jon back with us, his character and leadership is hard to replace. I know he is determined to make 2016 his best season yet.\" At the end of last season, Jon signed a one-year deal with the Arena Football Leagueâ€™s (AFL) Spokane Shock. \n\nCourtesy: Sioux Falls Storm DISCLAIMER: The views of the author are not necessarily those of this station, its owners, officers, agents or employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:57:39.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
