We'll take a lot from that - we're thinking if only we'd faced six or seven more balls each we'd have done it.\" \n\"I was hoping the umpires had taken them off for light with nine overs to even it up but there you go. \nEngland raised hopes of an unlikely draw and a s the last hour approached, and progressed, Pakistan's frustration began to match England's nerves. \nThey tourists then lost Mark Wood with 11.1 overs to go, before Adil Rashid departed for 61. \nCook added on Sky Sports: \"It's just so frustrating. Full credit to the way the guys batted today - but we all know the third morning really cost us. \n\"You always have the feeling 'today might be the day' but the odds were against us. \n\"There are a lot of good things to come out of it in one sense - but we shouldn't have been in that position. \n\"We're doing a lot of good things - nine of the 10 days have been fairly even but a tough two hours have cost us this game.\" \nPakistan now lead the three-match series going into the finale in Sharjah, which starts on Sunday. \nCook acknowledged that Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler did not have their best games for England but added: \" It's international cricket - there is always someone struggling a bit. \n\"The selectors will try to pick a side to win that game.\" \nPakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq was pleased with his team's victory. \nHe said: \"I think the performance, overall, was really good. \n\"It was a really good effort by the bowlers which enabled us to get them out.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:22:00.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
