Sometimes your body's not recovered,\" the 21-year-old said on court after the match. \nWilliams, who also looked stiff on court the day after a gruelling semi-final against her sister Serena's nemesis Roberta Vinci, conceded that she would have had a tough match against Muguruza if she had been on form. \n\"I probably wouldn't have had many chances if you had been feeling well,\" Venus said in an on court interview Copyright AFP (Agence France-Presse), 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:07:48.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
