Coach Tom Coughlin says Cruz will not play Sunday against Buffalo after aggravating a calf injury Wednesday. Instead, Cruz will work with trainers. There is no timetable for his return. Cruz had said Monday he expected to practice Wednesday and play Sunday. Cruz hurt his calf in training camp in August and has not practiced with the team. He has missed the first three games of the season and has not played in an NFL game since his season-ending knee injury last Oct. 12 against the Eagles. It was his second knee injury in two seasons. Bills playmakers out ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Buffalo Bills coach Rex Ryan ruled out running back LeSean McCoy and receiver Sammy Watkins from playing against the Giants. Ryan initially said he'd never use the word \"out\" after the two players missed their second straight day of practice. Then, Ryan shook his head sideways and said reporters could figure it out on their own. McCoy is sitting out to rest a left hamstring injury that's nagged him since he was hurt Aug. 18. Watkins was sidelined after hurting his right calf in a win at Miami on Sunday. Sapp takes plea deal LAS VEGAS — Hall of Famer Warren Sapp has taken a plea deal that spares him jail time in a domestic violence case involving a scuffle with his former girlfriend that began at a Las Vegas-area casino hotel. The 42-year-old former Buccaneers and Raiders defensive tackle pleaded no contest in Las Vegas Justice Court to one misdemeanor domestic violence charge. A judge fined Sapp $345, ordered him to pay $2,555 in restitution, log community service and counseling time and stay out of trouble for six months. Prosecutor Lisa Luzaich says Sapp also has to stay away from the victim. Sapp's attorney, Rich Tanasi, didn't immediately respond to messages. Sapp was accused of knocking down and stepping on the woman in April at the M Resort in Henderson and at her Las Vegas condominium. Decker practices FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — New York Jets wide receiver Eric Decker participated in some team drills for the first time since spraining his left knee nearly two weeks ago. Decker was hurt against Indianapolis in Week 2 and sat out last Sunday against Philadelphia. His status remains uncertain for the Jets' game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday in London. Coach Todd Bowles said he would like to see more from Decker during practice Friday in London before determining whether he'll play. Cornerback Darrelle Revis was limited for the second straight day with a sore hamstring. Revis said Wednesday he would be fine to play.
