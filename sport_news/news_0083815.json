We want to make sure that day-to-day, long-term, that he is fine. We can't worry about basketball right now as much as I think he is going to be a big part of what we do. But he has to get better first.\"\nBrown said that Charles, who is from Brooklyn, did not feel well Oct. 7, the day before the Danes had their first practice. Charles went straight to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with the condition, which Brown did not disclose.\nCharles has been taking medication and responding well to it, Brown said. If all goes well, he could be on the practice floor by Monday.\n\"It's scary,\" Brown said. \"I am not going to make the decision to put him on the court. That will have to come from the cardiologist and our doctors and trainers.\"\nCharles averaged 13.9 points and 6.7 rebounds for Howard County Community College in Texas last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:23:13.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
