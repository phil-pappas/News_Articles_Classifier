The Clippers leaned on the shoulders of improved blocking by the interior offensive line of Xavier McParlin, Sabastian Lambert, Lucas Gauthier, Ethan King and Domenick Johnson. That group got solid support from tight ends Sam Borne, Matthew Creighton and Jake Haley, leaving Epping nowhere to run. Portsmouth started the game with a methodical drive that was capped by a 21 yard-dash by Jack Connor, giving the Little Clippers a 7-0 lead. They had another great chance after Max Lalime beat the Epping kickoff return team to the football to give the ball back to his offense. But they cashed in later after both teams traded turnovers. Billy Omahen broke loose up the middle and cut to the sideline for a 75-yard TD run. Epping’s Cameron Philbrook showed tremendous hustle as he almost ran down the speedy Omahen, but Jack Radcliffe converted the point after to give Portsmouth a 14-0 lead at halftime. In the second half, Radcliffe scored a rushing touchdown and Lalime added the point after for a 21-0 lead. Later, Caleb Comstock joined Conner, Lalime and Omahen as they marched the ball down field with Lalime adding the last TD of the day to cap the scoring. Little Clipper B’s The Portsmouth LIttle Clipper B football team improved to 5-0 on the season, defeating Epping 26-0. Portsmouth set the tone on the first drive of the game behind solid runs from Gunner Jackson and Adam Croteau. After quarterback Evan Graham connected with Cooper Roy, bringing the ball down to the goal line, Max Diep punched in to give Portsmouth an early 6-0 lead. Epping responded with a long drive of its own, only to turn the ball over on downs in the red zone. It had a chance for redemption after a Portsmouth turnover, but the Clippers’ Alex O’Neil came up with a fumble recovery to thwart another Epping drive. Portsmouth then moved downfield with solid running and a long Graham completion to Jake Healy. With time running down in the second quarter, Graham was able to rush in from short yardage to give Portsmouth a 12-0 lead at halftime. Roy crunched Epping’s first drive of the half with a fumble recovery. Then, on the first series, he caught a pass from Graham and scampered into the end zone for a 58-yard catch and run. Charlie Turner added the extra point, making it 19-0 early in the third quarter. Adam Croteau added another score when he sprinted to the outside and down the sideline for a 93-yard TD run to cap the scoring. Junior Clipper varsity The varsity Junior Clippers beat the Rochester Red Raiders 48-12 in recent action, scoring Portsmouth its fourth victory this season. The Clippers came out strong on the opening drive, scoring on a 49-yard run by Peterson Monexant, who also capped off his team’s second drive with a 65-yard touchdown run. Calvin Hewitt kicked the extra point to put the Clippers ahead 14-6. Good defense kept the Raiders from scoring and Monexant had a 48-yard touchdown run to bring the score to 20-6. At the start of the second quarter, Jacob Boutin broke a 35-yard run, and quarterback Nico DellaCosta hit Hewitt in the end zone and Hewitt split the uprights to put the Clippers up 28-6. Boutin had a 57-yard touchdown run to bring the Clippers up 36-6, with another good extra point kick by Hewitt, and DellaCosta ran in a 25-yard keeper to bring the score to 42-6 at the half. Portsmouth’s defense was strong with great tackling by Casey Gladu, Noah Diep and Monexant, and interceptions by Oscar Lalime and Hewitt. Liam Ellis started the third quarter by recovering a fumbled kickoff. The Raiders answered with a 65-yard touchdown run, but Nolan Pafford blocked the extra point to make the score 42-12. The fourth quarter had interceptions by Matis Cole and Trevor Fournier and a 55-yard touchdown run Monexant to seal the win. Junior Clipper JVs The Junior Clippers JV squad suffered its first loss of the season in recent action at Tom Daubney Field, falling 20-6 to the Exeter East Seahawks. The Clippers scored first on a 9-yard run by Owen Fox. The touchdown was set up by a 28-yard pass from quarterback Cam Francois to receiver Willy Hindle. The Francois-Hindle duo hooked up on several occasions to lead the Clippers offense in the first half, which ended in a 6-6 deadlock. The Seahawks relied on a grinding ground attack that ultimately wore down the Clippers’ defense. Exeter stacked the middle of the offensive line and found the path to victory paved between the tackles and running right into the heart of the Portsmouth defense. Overall the Clipper defense continued its solid play this season with Joey Gobbi, Coleman Philbrick and Cam Fregeau keeping the Exeter offense in check early.
