Now that the Taft varsity football team’s time off is in the rear view mirror, they are turning their sights to the final three games of the regular season starting with Friday night’s game up in Wasco. “I think it was great for us to have the week off,” said Taft coach George Falgout. “I think we’re focused. These kids are dialed in each week. Even when they were on their bye week, they’re focused.” Taft, who is 6-1 overall and 2-1 in the South Sequoia League will be taking on a Tigers team that is 2-5 overall and 0-3 in the South Sequoia League. Both teams have had similar opponents so far in North and Cesar Chavez. While Taft split against those two, the Tigers lost 26-14 to North and 33-3 to Cesar Chavez. While this is a departure for a Wasco program that reached the semi finals two years ago. Falgout says the Tigers are not to be taken lightly. “I think they’re a team that can come out every week,’ said Falgout. “We’re taking it as we better bring our A game or we’ll be in trouble.” When it comes to what he knows about Wasco, Falgout says there are similarities between the offense for Taft and Wasco. “I know they run the same offense as we do,” he said. “They’re a powerful team. They play tough. I know the offense they run pretty well.” There are several players that stand out to Falgout. One of them is senior quarterback Ricky Rios. According to maxpreps.com , Rios is 7-for-11 passing for 114 yards. The backfield and offensive line also stand out to Falgout. “They block their offense very well,” he said. Despite those challenges, Falgout is confident in the team’s defense. “I think our defense will do well and be ready for Friday night,” he said. “I think he (Russell Emberson) has our kids dialed in and ready to go.” Falgout also likes how the Taft offense is doing. “Our offense is looking good,” he said. “We’re gelling a lot more.” One benefit for the Wildcats during the bye week was to rest up. As a result, Taft will be getting their starting quarterback Tevin Howell back from a mild concussion he got during the Cesar Chavez game. Page 2 of 2 - Other than Howell, Taft is completely healthy according to Falgout. ‘That’s why that bye in the seventh week helps us out a lot,” he said. Friday’s game will also be the last regular season game the Wildcats are playing on the road. “I think it’s great,” Falgout said of the final road game. Following Friday’s game, Taft will return home to face a surging Bakersfield Christian during homecoming week and a successful Robert F. Kennedy on senior night. Kickoff for Friday’s game is set for 7:30 p.m. By Matt Henry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:19:50.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
