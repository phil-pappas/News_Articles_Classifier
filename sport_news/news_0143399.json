Jordan Spieth is the 2014-15 PGA Tour Player of the Year. The award was announced Friday morning. It would have been unprecedented for a golfer who won as much as Spieth (including two majors) to not win this award.\nThe past four Player of the Year awards have gone to Rory McIlroy , Tiger Woods , McIlroy and now Spieth. That's a pretty solid stretch for golf's top award.\nSpieth cleaned up in 2015 with five wins, the Masters, the US Open and over $22 million in on-course earnings . He joins Tiger Woods (nine times), Rory McIlroy (twice), Jim Furyk , Luke Donald , Vijay Singh and Padraig Harrington as winners of the award since 2000.\nIt was quite a season for the hottest kid in American golf.\nHis reaction on Friday was pretty funny (and epitomizes Spieth's long-range attitude).\n\"You get a nice trophy and it goes down on your Wikipedia.\" - Spieth on what he gets for being POY\nâ€” Chris Chaney (@Wrong_Fairway) October 2, 2015 \"We won on some awesome tracks this year, some beautiful places,\" Spieth said after the Tour Championship. \"You have to conquer the golf course first and foremost. You have to conquer yourself, your own emotions, you have to win the mental battle with yourself.\"\nSpieth won a lot more than that. And now he has been recognized as having one of the all-time great seasons . I don't know what the encore will be or if there will be one, but history was made this season on the PGA Tour. \nJordan Spieth owned 2015. Now he has the hardware to prove it. Jordan Spieth wins all the awards.
