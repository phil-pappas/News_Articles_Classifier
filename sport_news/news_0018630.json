I deserve a little grace if it comes my way and I think I received that today. Hopefully, it lasts the rest of the week.\" \nGene Fieger of Naples, Florida, the 2013 champion, and Chris Starkjohann of Oceanside, California, were a stroke back. Fieger opened at Black Horse, and Starkjohann at Bayonet. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:14:47.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
