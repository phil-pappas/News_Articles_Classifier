It’s a goal and a possible achievement. If I can help these guys get down the slope in one piece and in a quick time then I’m all for it.” \nThe 33-year-old, who trains twice a week in Bath, is still a member of Birchfield Harriers and trains regularly at The Alexandra Stadium where he refuses to let go of a dream return to the summer Olympic sprinting squad. “Moving forward onto 2016 and I’m in a good place. I’ve got the support of physios who will keep me injury-free. I’ve got a speed team that I can work with,” he added. What do you think?

The power and speed in the bobsleigh will help me massively. \n“We’ve got back from Switzerland where we were training last week and it was my first ever two-man push. You just don’t realise how fast that thing moves – it’s a good job my legs can still move to jump in there! \nAfter suffering niggling injuries over the last couple of seasons, the Birchfield Harrier revealed the change in scenery is like a breath of fresh air.
