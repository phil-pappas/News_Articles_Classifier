(Photo: File) \nDusty Baker’s name is coming up again on the manager rumor mill. He interviewed for the vacant job with the Washington Nationals. The Miami Marlins are reportedly interested as well. If Don Mattingly is out with the Los Angeles Dodgers, I’m guessing Baker’s name gets some run there as well. Baker’s best playing days were with the Dodgers and he’s still popular there. \nThe attention for Baker comes after he didn’t get any real attention, despite lots of openings, in the two years after the Reds fired him. \nBaker made it clear he had not retired. But when he inquired about jobs, he didn’t hear back. \nIt was beginning to look like Baker’s days of managing were over. More and more general managers came up through the ranks as analytic guys. Baker has been Public Enemy of No. 1 of the Sabermetrics crowd. \nHe was not popular with a large base of Red fans because of that. Well, that and because some people think the most important thing a manager does is fill out the lineup card — as if batting Joey Votto second instead of third was the answer to all that was wrong with the Reds. Dusty Baker out of baseball, into the garden \nEven Baker’s most ardent critics would be hard pressed to make the argument that he was the problem here. The team won 91, 79, 97 and 90 games respectively in his last four years here. The Reds have won 79 and 64 games in the two years since Baker was dismissed. \nBaker lost his job here because of the postseason failures. Ownership believed that changing the manager and his coaching staff before the 2013 season would be a boost. \nI wrote then that that was flawed logic. I still believe that. That’s not to say Baker would have won the last two years. But he didn't hold the team back. \nIn baseball, it’s always largely about the Reds. \nCase in point: My Twitter feed would fill up night after night with questions about how Baker’s hitting coach, Brook Jacoby, kept his job. The Reds average with runners in scoring position was constantly cited as evidence of Jacoby's failure. \nJacoby, of course, was fired along with Baker. As Baker told it, he was told to fire Jacoby, Baker refused and it led to Reds and Baker parting ways. \nSo what’s become of Jacoby? He’s the hitting coach for the Toronto Blue Jays. Jacoby screwed things up so badly in Toronto that the Jays only scored 127 more than any team in baseball and led the world in on-base and slugging. \nAgain, it’s largely the players. \nThat’s why I think Baker would be a good fit in Washington or LA. He’s very good at getting the most out of his players. Baker has the unique ability to have players like him and fear him a bit at the same time. \nHe also relates to everyone on the roster. He speaks Spanish, a huge factor with the Latin players. \nHe also knows what buttons to push at what time. I think the biggest turning point in Baker’s tenure with the Reds came in 2010. The Reds had just suffered the most heart-wrenching loss in years. They blew an 8-0 lead and lost when Francisco Cordero gave up a walk-off grand slam — on a ball Laynce Nix should have caught no less — in a 10-9 loss in Atlanta. \nThe team flew to Cleveland after the game. Baker called a team meeting in the hotel bar. He made everyone get a drink. He basically said: We’ve got to put this behind us and move on. It was a short meeting. Afterward players headed in large groups to dinner, drinks and bonding. And they got over it. \nThe debacle in Atlanta happened on May 20. The Reds were nine seasons removed from a winning record. It could have very easily sent them reeling again. \nIt didn’t. They won the next two in Cleveland — the start of a seven-of-nine run. \nThe Reds went on to win the division two of the next three years. They made the playoffs three of the next four years. \nBaker’s legacy here was sealed by the failure in the 2012 division series. Had the Reds closed that out against the Giants, I think Baker would still be the manager here. \nBut they didn’t. He got fired. But if you look at his record with the Reds and talk to players he managed, he’s a guy who deserves another chance. 124 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1ROBJXr TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:02:09.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
