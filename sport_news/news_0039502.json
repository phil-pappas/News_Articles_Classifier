The last two games (have) been a great team effort.\"\nThis was the first time the Hawks were shut out since March 21 of last season. Including playoffs, the Hawks had scored at least 1 goal in 37 straight games.\nCorey Crawford was solid in net for the Hawks, making 26 saves. They fell to 2-2-0 and still haven't won in Philadelphia in the regular season since November 1996.\n\"We're still feeling each other out as a team, making sure we're all prepared, we're all ready to go before the game,\" Jonathan Toews said. \"It starts with the guys that have been here for a number of years -- guys that know what it takes, especially early on.\"\nThe best scoring chance for the Hawks came while short-handed midway through the second period when Viktor Svedberg zipped a pass to a wide-open and streaking Marian Hossa. Hossa, though, shot the puck into Neuvirth's right pad and the Flyers maintained their 1-0 edge.\nSaid Neuvirth: \"That was a huge save for us, definitely.\"\nThe Hawks outshot the Flyers 15-6 in the third period and had numerous big-time scoring chances.\nPanarin, though, was denied at the net by winger Wayne Simmons when Simmons just got enough of Panarin's stick to keep the Russian from scoring into a wide-open net at 19:05.\nToews also could have made it 2-1, but he couldn't force the puck past Neuvirth after getting a pass from Hossa with 4:25 to go.\nViktor Tikhonov was one of the few Hawks who stood out Wednesday and played with Toews and Hossa on the top line during the third period.\nStill, Quenneville didn't want to talk about mixing up the lines after the game.\n\"It wasn't about trying different things tonight,\" he said. \"We were brutal.\"\n• Before Wednesday's game, the Flyers honored Kimmo Timonen, who spent seven seasons playing for Philadelphia before being traded to the Blackhawks last season. The 40-year-old Timonen, who played in 1,213 games (including playoffs) in the NHL, retired after the Hawks won the Stanley Cup in June.\n\"The people who admired Kimmo's career got to feel, 'Wow, what a great finish to … a tremendous career,'\" Quenneville told reporters in Philly. \"So it's fitting that we're here and he gets honored here tonight.\"\nTimonen said that more than 10,000 people showed up when he brought the Cup home to Kuopio, Finland.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
