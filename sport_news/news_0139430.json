Douglas advanced to the all-around finals with a 57.516. Three-time Olympic medalist Aly Raisman finished fourth in the all-around but will not compete in the finals because of rules limiting countries to two competitors in each event.\nThe U.S. opened with a dynamic series of floor routines that sent a message it is primed for a repeat.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
