NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BIDDERS: If you are considering bidding on this property lien you should understand that there are risks involved in bidding at a Trustees Sale (auction). You will be bidding on a lien. Although you will receive title to the property, placing the highest bid at a Trustee auction DOES NOT automatically entitle you to free and clear ownership of the property. You should be aware that the lien being auctioned off may be a junior lien. If you are the highest bidder at the auction you will be, or may be, responsible for paying off all liens senior to the lien being auctioned before you can receive clear title to the property. You are encouraged to investigate the existence, priority and amount of outstanding liens that may exist on this property by contacting the County Recorders Office or a title insurance company, either of which may charge you a fee for this information. If you consult either of these resources you should be aware that the same lender may hold more than one mortgage or deed of trust on the property. NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNER: The sale date shown on this Notice of Sale may be postponed one or more times, pursuant to California Civil Code Section 2924g. The law requires that information about Trustee Sale postponements be made available to you and the public, as a courtesy to those not present at the sale. If you would like to know whether your sale date has been postponed, and/or the rescheduled time and date for the sale of this property, you may call (408) 374-7204 or visit www.foreclosureco.com and check Trustees Sale #15-226. Information about postponements that are short in duration or that occur close to the scheduled sale time may not immediately be reflected in the telephone information or online. The best way to verify postponement information is to attend the scheduled sale. Said sale will be made without covenant or warranty, expressed or implied, regarding title, possession or encumbrances, to satisfy the obligations secured by and pursuant to the Power of Sale conferred in a certain Deed of Trust executed by Robert A.
