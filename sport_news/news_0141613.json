He added that changing the calendar will be controversial because it will affect investments and traditions. \nThe busy final weeks of the season, which include a rising number of events in Asia, has been marked by a series of injuries and retirements. \n“To do some of the things we have to do, we have to make some fundamental changes in the calendar and our approach to it,” he said. \n“I think we have to take an honest and open look at that. That’ll probably be the first thing that begins to create controversy and angst among the group as we have those types of conversations.” \nThe WTA Finals, involving the top eight players, will be followed on November 2 by the inaugural WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, featuring players ranked nine-20, with one wildcard. \nChina alone has eight WTA events this year amid explosive growth in the sport following the career of the now retired Li Na, Asia’s most successful tennis player with two Grand Slams to her name. \nWorld No.1 Serena Williams pulled out of Singapore to “heal” her body and restore motivation after losing the US Open final in September. \nSecond-ranked Simona Halep, the WTA Finals’ top seed, was forced to retire in her opening match at the China Open in Beijing due to an ankle injury. \nPetra Kvitova, Garbine Muguruza, Victoria Azarenka and Belinda Bencic are also among the players who have retired from matches in recent weeks. \nTennis great Martina Navratilova, who will hold talks with Simon, said “the number of injuries withdrawals is still too high”. \n“You got to think long-term. Maybe it’s great to have all these tournaments but at the end of the day, if you don’t have enough players playing, you got a problem,” she said.
