Roger Kinney, public information officer for the West Sacramento Police Department. \nAfter the man was hit, the train and its passengers remained at the scene for 90 minutes, police said. \nThe man has not been identified. Once an identification is made, the Yolo County Coroner’s Office will contact the victim’s family, Kinney said. \nBlair Anthony Robertson: 916-321-1099 , @Blarob Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:50:52.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
