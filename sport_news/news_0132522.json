Comment Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 3:04 AM Updated Oct 2, 2015 at 3:07 AM Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 3:04 AM Updated Oct 2, 2015 at 3:07 AM WALTHAM – The monotonous routine of their training camp is about to be altered over the next week. The Celtics will board a plane late tonight and head for Europe with stops in Italy and Spain, leaving behind the comfortable confines of their training facility. The team will be taking part in the NBA’s Global Games Europe, playing exhibition games against Olympia Milano in Italy on Tuesday and Real Madrid in Spain on Thursday. They will be practicing in both countries and doing some sightseeing in a preseason trip that will allow new teammates to get to know one another. Since the Celtics are going abroad, they were allowed to open training camp last Saturday, ahead of other NBA teams. The Celtics also will be playing just seven preseason games rather than the normal eight. “I think it’s a good thing that you get a chance to do the overseas trip,’’ said coach Brad Stevens. “I like how that has been scheduled as far as the timing. I like playing one less exhibition game. I think I’m among a group of coaches that would vote for less exhibition games because everybody’s anxious to get the season started. “You want as much practice time as you can get. It’s nice to have a week of practice before we leave and it’s nice we get a couple of days to adjust when we get over there. “We’re well behind Milan and Madrid in practice time and that’ll be good for us because we’re going to have to be able to keep up with their pace at both ends of the floor and that’ll be a real challenge early on.’’ The Celtics are scheduled to practice this afternoon before their evening departure, giving them eight workouts in camp so far. This marks the third time in nine years the Celtics have traveled out of the country for a portion of their camp. In 2007, the first year that Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen were on the team, the Celtics went to Rome and London, and that trip was known as the time when the team bonded at the start of a championship season. In 2012, the Celtics went to Turkey and Spain, losing to the Turkish team Fenerbahce Ulker, 97-91. Six of the 16 players under contract are new to the Celtics, and Stevens is hoping the team can build some on- and off-the-court chemistry while in Italy and Spain. “I laugh about that a little bit,’’ said Stevens, “because I’ve been on overseas trips with the college teams where you come back and don’t have a very good season, then you come back and go to the national championship (game with Butler). Page 2 of 2 - “When we went to the national championship game, I talked about how great it was. The bottom line is it’s a good team bonding experience, the opportunity to improve together and spend time together is a good, positive thing. It’s a small piece of a long puzzle.’’ President of basketball operations Danny Ainge traveled to Europe when he played for the Celtics in the 1980s. He is not a big believer that teams come together on trips like this one. “I think our team can get better wherever we’re having training camp,’’ said Ainge. “I’m not sure there’s some magic in Europe or some magic traveling outside of this gym right here. “I think it has a lot more to do with the attitude of players and coaches and the health of players. I think training camp will be fine. “I liked going to Europe when I was a player. It was something different. I’m not sure I got anything more out of it, but it was fun. Hopefully the players will have a good experience. I think the thing we get out of it more than anything is we get a few extra days of training camp.’’ Comcast SportsNet will televise both games in Europe. The Celtics will fly home after the game next Thursday and have a couple of days off before resuming camp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:42:57.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
