Chara, who sustained an upper-body injury in a Sept. 24 preseason game, has been skating for more than a week and began practicing Tuesday, but he and the team decided it was best not to risk reinjury so early in the season. \"I'm OK to be smart about it,\" said Chara, who participated in the morning skate in advance of Thursday's opener against the Winnipeg Jets at TD Garden. \"Obviously, I want to play as soon as I can, but at the same time, it's Game One. Not that it's less important than any other game, but at this time I just wanted to continue to have progress and keep going forward with it, instead of having any setbacks.\" Chara doesn't know if he'll be ready to play Saturday night's game against the visiting Canadiens. \"No guess,\" he said. \"Looking forward to [Friday].\" With both Chara and Dennis Seidenberg (back surgery) sidelined, the Bruins set up defense pairs of Torey Krug-Adam McQuaid, Matt Irwin-Zach Trotman and Joe Morrow-Kevan Miller to face the Jets. Colin Miller was the projected healthy scratch on the blue line. With Chara on injured reserve, the Bruins had 14 forwards, seven defensemen and two goalies on their active roster. Max Talbot, who cleared waivers on Tuesday,and Tyler Randell were the projected healthy scratches at forward against the Jets. Tuukka Rask will start in goal for the Bruins.
