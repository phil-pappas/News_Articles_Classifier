San Antonio College in its season opener. \nSaddleback took a 6-0 lead on a Jojo Binda 7-yard run in the first quarter and extended the lead on quarterback Jacob Gibsonâ€™s 52-yard TD strike to Remy Wasserbach just before the half. \nGibson completed 10-of-18 passes for 106 yards, two TDs and one interception. The Gauchos ran the ball 42 times for 163 yards as a team. \nKenny Torrence ran the ball 18 times for 53 yards to lead COC, but he also lost one of two Cougars fumbles. Dunn lost the other in Saddleback territory. \nIt was, however, a non-conference game. And the Cougars currently sit in a tie atop the National Division, Northern Conference at 2-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:37:06.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
