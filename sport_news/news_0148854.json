The Greyhounds scored first, but the Eagles scored the next 56 in their 56-13 win. slideshow MARIETTA — Momentum is mentioned a lot in football, and Etowah grabbed it early and never let go in a 56-13 win over Pope in the Hound Pound on Friday night.Pope jumped out to a 6-0 lead on a converted fourth-down play that went for a touchdown, but Bronson Rechsteiner returned the ensuing kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and the Eagles never looked back.“I was so happy to get that special teams touchdown there, and that is definitely a momentum deal right there,” Etowah coach Dave Svehla said. “It was huge. We have given up some long passes the last couple weeks, and we gave one up on that first drive.“You just don’t want your kids to think about what happened in the past and have it impact them. When you have a special teams play, where you are able to answer right away, I think it gets your adrenaline going again. It gets your energy back up.”Pope coach Kyle Adkins said his team has not figured out a way to keep the momentum going this season.“I don’t understand what happens after our first drives in our games. We come out lights-out virtually every game, but we can’t seem to do it the rest of the game,” Adkins said. “I don’t have an answer for that yet. It is just the same story, different week.”Etowah (5-1, 3-1 Region 5 ) rattled off 56 points before Pope (0-5, 0-3) got close to the end zone again. The Eagles held the Greyhounds to 253 total yards, with Pope compiling 79 of those yards on the final drive of the game.Pope quarterback Evan Conley did seem to have a connection going with Patrick Burke early in the game, as Conley found Burke for the 40-yard touchdown to open the scoring. Burke caught four passes in the first half for 125 yards, but he did not catch a ball in the second half.The big play seemed to be there for Pope, but Svehla said his team found a way to not let the big plays find the end zone.“I thought our kids played well, and we recovered from a couple big plays,” Svehla said. “They did a great job on that first drive of theirs and they just had a couple of good players making some plays.”The Eagles again relied on a balanced rushing attack, as Tyray Devezin rushed for 98 yards and two touchdowns on 12 carries, Vincent Riley rushed for 80 yards and a touchdown on five carries and Quorealus Smith had 77 yards and a touchdown on four carries. Quarterback Patrick Ferris added four carries for 47 yards and two touchdowns as Etowah rushed for 315 yards as a team.“Our offense was pretty consistent,” Svehla said. “We didn’t have a ton of big plays offensively. We just methodically moved the ball, and I am OK with that. We were able to get the ball to a lot of people (Friday).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:52:10.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
