The remaining money, most of it county dollars, will pay for renovations that will remove the bar, private dance areas, add more toilets, fix up the commercial kitchen and add laundry facilities, said Human Solutions Executive Director Andy Miller .\nHuman Solutions director explains meaning of vice to nice Andy Miller, director of hHuman Solutions Inc., discuss plans to convert a closed strip club into a homeless shelter.\n\"From vice to nice,\" he said about transforming the closed Black Cauldron building located at 16015 S.E. Stark St. into a use that's received support by neighborhood groups. Residents and neighborhoods don't normally support the opening of a homeless shelter in their area, he said.\nIn exchange for the $300,000 loan, the nonprofit agrees to operate the shelter for at least six years, a service valued at $50,000 annually, according to loan paperwork . If the nonprofit backs out or the county chooses another contractor, the county has dibs to take over the property and keep the shelter running.\nFor seven years, Human Solutions has typically provided shelter services for families during the winter season, Miller said. Instead of finding a property to lease only for the winter season, the unexpected option to purchase the property allows for year-round operations.\nIf completed by February, the shelter should house up to 130 individuals a day, Miller said. That's up from a capacity of about 100 in years past, he said.\nUrban League of Portland President and CEO Nkenge Harmon Johnson said she was excited for Human Solutions. The Urban League has seen homeless and poor populations, especially among African Americans, who have been pushed out into eastern areas of the county from gentrification, she said. It's an area her organization plans to serve as well, she said.\n\"I am also excited for the opportunity for the Urban League to come before you in the months to come with a similar opportunity,\" she said. \"When it's our turn to say we've got this deal, this package, we want to bring together to purchase property that will allow us to better serve the community that we serve.\"\nHer comments came moments after Multnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith warned that this deal was made outside the public process.\n\"I do have a problem with us setting up a nonprofit and giving them an asset that is theirs,\" Smith said. \"I would have much preferred us buy the project, and they lease it back. That would have been a better tool.\"\nThe county plans, by June 30, 2016, to begin seeking qualified nonprofits to provide the various homeless services for the next five years. Smith said the deal means that county staff could be pressured to recommend Human Solutions to keep its contract.\nMiller said if the county chooses another nonprofit for the services at the Stark Street location, it would lease the property to another nonprofit to use the facility.\nThe half-acre property contains the 7,438-square-foot building currently owned by JZ Property Management in Lake Oswego, according to PortlandMaps.com, a website of the City of Portland. Its market value stands at $1.2 million, according to the website. Officials have said the purchase price is about $1 million.\nMary Li, director of the county's Community Services Division, said past family shelters in the area haven't been suitable for large numbers of families. They have lacked sufficient kitchens or other basic amenities that a shelter should have.\nBut the building needs a lot of work.\nWalking into the closed club, it's certainly suited for October and Halloween with paintings of warlocks and scantily clad witches and fairies adorning the walls. Liquor bottles were left on the bar, used pots and pans in the kitchen. Clothes and undergarments, and heels, were left in the dressing room.\nChairwoman Deborah Kafoury said officials at the city of Gresham were happy with the county's steps to put the building \"into the community's hands instead of having it be a place where women are victimized.\"\nFor more reading:\nOur Homeless Crisis: For families on the street, there's only one sure option\nOur Homeless Crisis: Family Winter Shelter will stay open through academic year's end\n-- Tony Hernandez\nthernandez@oregonian.com\n503-294-5928\n@tonyhreports", "external_links": ["http://humansolutions.org/about-us/leadership/", "https://multco.us/loretta-smith", "https://ulpdx.org/", "http://www.twitter.com/tonyhernandez", "https://ulpdx.org/staff-2/", "http://humansolutions.org/", "http://multnomah.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=3&event_id=502&meta_id=80473"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:06:30.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
