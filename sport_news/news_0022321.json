The Lions' defense showed signs of life against Seattle. And Matthew Stafford proved he can be effective — late in the game. If only Stafford could move the team like that all the time.\nDrew Sharp\n• Cardinals 24, Lions 20: The Lions recover emotionally from their disastrous finish Monday night in Seattle. And rumor has it they'll actually have an offensive play that will gain more than 40 yards from the line of scrimmage. But they're simply facing a much better team that has more to play for in Week 5 than the Lions. The Lions can't blame the refs for this loss, leaving them to revert back to the dozens of other excuses for losing.\nThis week's guest picker: Joseph Friedli (Photo: Courtesy photo)\nToday's guest picker is Joseph Friedli of East Lansing, who won the Free Press Twitter contest last week by picking a 17-10 Seahawks win over the Lions.\n• Lions 20, Cardinals 17: A comeback by Matthew Stafford doesn't fall short this time. The return of DeAndre Levy and a huge game by a motivated Calvin Johnson will ignite the Lions to their first victory.\nYou pick 'em!\nLions fans!
