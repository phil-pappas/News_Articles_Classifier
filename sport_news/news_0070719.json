Cincinnati defeated Seattle 27-24 in overtime. CINCINNATI, OH - OCTOBER 11: Dre Kirkpatrick #27 of the Cincinnati... The Seattle Seahawks lost their mojo, but it's not that difficult to find.\nIt's on the outskirts of Phoenix -- inside a stadium that looks a bit like a spaceship -- buried at about the 1-yard line, at the exact spot where the team stopped believing it was destined to win.\nSince the Seahawks' heartbreaking loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, they've forgotten how to close out an opponent.\nIn their last six games that mattered, including the Hawks' loss to the Pats on the biggest stage of them all last February, Seattle has been outscored 67-13 in the fourth quarter. It's a disturbing turn of events for a team that prided itself on its ability to dominate opponents late in games.\nSince 2012, the Seahawks have ranked no worse then tenth in the NFL in fourth-quarter scoring, averaging 7.7 points in the game's final frame. On the other side of the ball, Seattle's defense has been among the best in the league in shutting down opponents late in games, giving up just 4.2 points per fourth quarter.\nEven during their 3-3 start in 2014, which included a Week 3 Super Bowl XLVIII rematch with the Denver Broncos that saw the Seahawks give up a 14-point fourth quarter lead only to win the game in overtime, Seattle gave up just 1.1 more points than they scored in the game's final 15 minutes (7.2 to 8.3).\nThis year, something's different.\nThrough the first five weeks of the 2015 campaign, the Seahawks are being outscored 10.6 to 2.6 in the fourth quarter, when they've also given up leads in losses to the St. Louis Rams in Week 1 and the Green Bay Packers in Week 2.\nOn Sunday, things got even worse, as the Hawks blew a whopping 17-point advantage in the final quarter en route to a 27-24 loss that dropped them to 2-3 on the season. The loss tied for the worst fourth-quarter collapse in franchise history, and afterward head coach Pete Carroll said the entire team needed to shoulder the blame for the loss, including himself.\n\"We all share in it, so we all have to work to fix it, because there's too many different things that happened across the board, where we couldn't get off the field or we couldn't convert the third down or we got a couple miscues and penalties or stuff like that,\" Carroll said. \"It's just spread throughout.\"\nHe's right. An offense that shredded the Bengals to the tune of 328 total yards through the first three quarters managed a paltry 39 in five fourth-quarter and overtime possessions. And a defense that bounced back from an opening drive touchdown to allow Cincinnati to rack up just 139 yards on their next seven possessions failed when it counted most, allowing 230 yards in five fourth-quarter and overtime drives.\nCrunch time used to be the Hawks' time to shine, when Richard Sherman tipped away a would-be Colin Kaepernick score or when Russell Wilson found Jermaine Kearse for a game-winning deep ball. But since Wilson threw the fateful interception to New England's Malcolm Butler in the closing seconds of Super Bowl XLIX more than eight months ago, the team looks almost resigned to its fate when the game is on the line.\nTrue, Kam Chancellor's forced fumble on Detroit's Calvin Johnson -- with an assist from the officiating crew -- saved the day last Monday against the Lions, when Seattle looked in danger of surrendering yet another fourth-quarter lead. But in hindsight, Chancellor's heroics are starting to look less like a return to form and more like an exception that proves the rule.\nThe Seahawks may have met in Hawaii this spring to talk through their feelings about the blown back-to-back Super Bowl titles, to bond together as a team and move on. But if they want to salvage their season, what they need moving forward is an exorcism, something that wipes away the demons of their recent late-game collapses.\nAfter Sunday's game, Carroll sounded confident they'd find their way back.\n\"We've had to be terrific in this moment for years to do what we've done,\" he said. \"And so just three games here, they're all basically the same storyline at the end. We can fix that and we can change our season around, and that's what we plan to do.\"\nMight we suggest hiring a priest?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:39:36.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
