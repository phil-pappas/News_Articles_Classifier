Frank McCourt is now the sole owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers , thanks to a divorce settlement that will pay his estranged wife, Jamie, about $130 million, paving the way for his impending battle with Major League Baseball for control of the franchise.\nJamie McCourt reportedly agreed to withdraw her opposition to her estranged husband's efforts to sell the Dodgers' media rights to Fox for $3 billion and filed a motion supporting the deal. The terms of the agreement, the conclusion of an ugly divorce, have not been made public.\n\"Jamie is pleased that this matter has been fairly resolved in the best interests of her family and the Dodgers' fans, players and organization,\" her spokesman, Matthew Hiltzik , said Monday in a statement.\n\"From the beginning, Jamie has consistently expressed her willingness to accept a settlement, even if it required her to give up her interest in the Dodgers, the team she loves, if a fair resolution were possible. That has now been achieved through the cooperation of everyone involved and Jamie looks forward to moving on and focusing on new opportunities.\"\nFrank McCourt 's spokesman, Randy James , declined comment when asked where the Dodgers' owner will come up with the money for the divorce settlement. A source familiar with the agreement said it calls for McCourt to complete the payment to his wife by next spring.\nThe deal may force McCourt to sell the team, since commissioner Bud Selig had made it clear that he will not approve the proposed TV deal with Fox.\nThe McCourts had reached a divorce settlement on June 17, but the deal was contingent on approval of the proposed television contract between the Dodgers and Fox. That deal would have given Jamie McCourt $100 million, but Selig nixed the 17-year TV contract because $150 million of the $385 million Frank McCourt would have received up front would have been diverted from the Dodgers to pay for legal fees and other debts.\nThe divorce case has been placed on hold until a bankruptcy court in Delaware determines the fate of the team. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday and a judge will consider dueling motions over four days starting Oct. 31.\nAfter Frank McCourt took the Dodgers into bankruptcy on June 27, his estranged wife joined MLB and Fox in asking the bankruptcy court to reject Frank McCourt's bid to auction Dodgers television rights. It is still unclear if the bankruptcy judge would allow Frank McCourt to use the TV money for the settlement if he prevails in court.\nThe McCourts have racked up more than $20 million in legal fees, making it the costliest divorce proceeding in California hisotry.\nMajor League Baseball assumed control of the day-to-day operations of the Dodgers in April. Selig appointed Tom Schieffer , the former president of the Texas Rangers , to run the team because he said he was concerned about how the the Dodgers' finances were being managed.\nSchieffer, a long-time baseball insider who was an investor in the Texas ownership group fronted by former President George W. Bush , served as the Rangers' president from 1991 to 1999. He oversaw construction of The Ballpark in Arlington , which opened in 1994.\nA Los Angeles judge ruled in December that the prenuptial agreement that gave Frank McCourt sole ownership of the Dodgers was invalid. Jamie McCourt, the CEO of the franchise until she was fired by her ex-husband two years ago, sought half the team under California's community property law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:01:52.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
