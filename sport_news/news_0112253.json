One of her former players was current Spartans head coach Adrienne Searfoss. Dierking also coached for seven seasons at DeSales University and most recently for four seasons at Parkland High School. \nRELATED : Rapid recap: Moravian Academy downs Southern Lehigh in Colonial League title game \nDierking and Bross coached against each other for many years and ultimately gained a mutual respect for one another. \n“Deb’s a terrific coach,” said Dierking, who primarily works with Moravian’s goalies. “We have the same coaching style as far as philosophies, strategies and how to work with the kids. We never disagree. We always agree on everything.” \n“Pat is awesome,” Bross said. “To add someone to our staff of her caliber is pretty special.” \nBross made a special point not to overlook her other assistants – Wendy Sheetz, Alice Friend and Kacy Friend. \n“We just have good coaches all the way around,” Bross said. “We all respect each other. We have eyes all over the field. We work very well together and complement each other. To have a staff full of teachers like that is fabulous.” \nDierking admitted it was awkward playing the championship game against Southern Lehigh. \n“It was very strange,” she said, “but obviously I’m going to root for whoever I’m coaching for.” \nA humble Dierking refuses to take much credit for Moravian’s success. \n“I have nothing to do with that,” Dierking said. “That happened way before I got here. All I’ve done is fine-tune things here and there.” \nWith a few days off before the District 11 playoffs, the Moravian players and coaching staff will all gather at Bross’ house on Friday for banana bread and chocolate milk. \n“It’s been my tradition every year,” Bross said. “We have the time so we’re going to do it on Friday. It’s a team event after practice.” \nDierking could sense something special was on the horizon when the team began practicing last August. \n“The camaraderie was really nice,” she said. “They really care for each other. They’re very coachable…very pleasant girls. You ask them to do something and they do it. They’re just real easy to coach.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
