He has struck out 12 batters in 8 1/3 innings pitched and has increased the frequency of his fastball, which is now being thrown more than 71 percent of the time. \nAnd that’s help keep batters on both sides of the plate from hitting for too much power. \nKelvin Herrera struggled in August and September but averaged more than 97 mph on his fastball and has held opposing batters to a .531 OPS against in high-leverage situations, those times when the game is most on the line. \nRyan Madson has lost the past four seasons to injury but bounced back to post a 2.13 ERA while striking out 58 batters in 63 1/3 innings of work, walking just 14. He has the second highest context neutral wins , or WPA/LI , on the team (1.00), which directly measure a player’s contributions to his team’s win expectancy, while neutralizing for leverage index so that players don’t get a large bonus by being in high leverage situations more often. Only current closer Wade Davis has been better (2.18 WPA/LI), and he has the highest mark among all of baseball’s qualified relievers. \nDavis’s fastball has held opposing hitters to a .155 average against with 40 strikeouts over 116 at-bats ending with the pitch this season, but his curve and cutter have also been as unhittable: .163 against the former and .129 against the latter. \n“ He’s been one of the most dominant relievers in all of baseball , and Wade doesn’t care what inning it’s in, if it’s the eighth or the ninth,” Yost said. “I mean, he had 11, 12, 13 saves before we named him the closer, so I mean, he was well familiar with that type of inning. He just goes out and gets it done.” Neil Greenberg analyzes advanced sports statistics for the Fancy Stats blog and prefers to be called a geek rather than a nerd. sports Success!
