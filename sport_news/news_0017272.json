Southwind (two league losses) travels to face three-loss Bolton while Central (two losses) hosts last-place Overton.\nKirby, also with two losses, took on Wooddale in a late Thursday game.\nMunford and Brighton are in great shape, but it likely will come down to tiebreakers to sort out the rest. Stay tuned.\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n(4) Munford (8-0, 5-0 Region 8-5A) at (12) Brighton (7-1, 4-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Should be a dynamite atmosphere at Brighton as two of this season's biggest surprises collide. Munford has only allowed 118 points this year and will have to contend with some skilled Cardinals playmakers led by running backs Zach Camp and Malik Matthews. Look for the Cougars to use their ground game to put together some (hopefully) time-consuming drives.\nDANDY DOZEN GAMES\n(1) Whitehaven (7-1, 4-1 Region 4-6A) at Collierville (4-4, 2-3), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: A victory for the Dragons would go a long way toward helping them land a top-four finish and a home playoff game in the first round. But the Tigers have been clicking lately and are one of only two teams in town (along with Cordova) ranked in the top 10 in both total offense (seventh) and defense (10th).\nCraigmont (1-7) at (3) MUS (6-2), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: It's been a disappointing season for the Chiefs, who despite winning just once will still make the 4A playoffs. MUS will want to fine-tune some things in time for next week's showdown vs. CBHS and get through the night without any key injuries.\nCatholic (1-7) at (5) CBHS (6-2), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: The Brothers invoked the mercy rule in five of their six wins, and it would be a major shock if they don't do it again against a Catholic team whose only win came against Rossville Christian (22-20 on Sept. 25).\nGermantown (4-4, 3-2 Region 4-6A) vs. (6) White Station (5-3, 4-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: The Spartans look good for a top-four finish in the region and a home playoff opener that will come with it. Germantown has responded well after a shaky start, and a win here would solidify their top-four status as well.\nHouston (1-7, 1-4 Region 4-6A) at (7) Cordova (7-1, 4-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Cordova is also on track for a home playoff game and will be itching to get back on the field after dropping its first game of the year against White Station two weeks ago. Houston has some talented playmakers, but Cordova has the area's second-best defense.\nFayette-Ware (4-4) at (8) Northpoint (9-0), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Fayette-Ware deserves a ton of credit for its efforts this year. But the Wildcats will need their best performance yet to defeat a hard-nosed Northpoint team, which has held three of its last four opponents to seven points.\nMAHS (4-3) at (9) St. George's (7-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: The Lions have the unenviable task of trying to slow the area's No. 1 offense. St. George's has scored 49, 54, 45 and 73 points in its last four games and will look to stay on a good roll with University School of Jackson looming in next week's finale.\n(10) Olive Branch (5-3, 3-1 MHSAA 1-6A) at Columbus-Miss. (6-2, 4-0), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Columbus has won four straight, including a 20-10 victory over Southaven last week. Running back Kylin Hill is the Falcons' bell cow and stopping him will be top priority for the Quistors, who have won four of their last five.\n(11) DeSoto Central (6-3, 2-2 MHSAA 1-6A) at Tupelo (3-5, 1-3), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Tip your hat to DeSoto Central running back Alan Lamar, who has run for 2,022 yards (224.7 average per game) and accounted for 38 touchdowns so far. Another big game from him will be enough for DC to come out on top.\nTODAY'S OTHER GAMES\n7 p.m. — Bartlett at Arlington, Hamilton at Bolivar Central, Southwind at Bolton, Overton vs. Central at Crump, St. Benedict at ECS, Kingsbury at First Assembly, Horn Lake at Hernando, Center Hill at Lake Cormorant, Harding at Lancaster Christian, Manassas at Lausanne, New Hope at Lewisburg, North Little Rock at Marion, Trezevant vs. Mitchell at J.P.
