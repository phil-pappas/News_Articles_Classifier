Robinson says he thinks the players are fine but that the team is going through “an identity crisis right now.”\nBurleson, meanwhile, said he thinks it’s “time to panic” saying he thinks there is no clear identity on offense and that teams are no longer scared of Seattle’s secondary.\nHere are some of those quotes, as provided by the NFL Network:\nOn what is wrong with the Seahawks defense: \nMichael Robinson: “I don’t think there is anything wrong with them. I really don’t. These guys, they’ve been through everything together, they’re battle-tested and if you look at last year they were in the same position last year through six games as they are right now. Actually, the defense is performing better this year at this point than they were last year. I think they’re just going through really an identity crisis as a team right now. They have to figure out each year who they are. It’s not the year before. It’s not like people are just scared of the Seahawks anymore; they’re not just going to go out on the field and beat teams. I look at the offensive side of the ball, they’re not finishing drives. They have one of the worst offensives in the fourth quarter and I think that’s the big problem.” \nNate Burleson: “We had this conversation Week 1 and Week 2, and I said it’s time to panic. I talked to the people in Seattle and I said it was time to panic because there are things they need to fix that will start to rear its head later in the season. Right now we’re at the midway point almost and we’re seeing the same things. We’re seeing the lack of production offensively, no true identity; they fed Jimmy Graham a little bit more which was great. But now on the defensive side of the ball, what scared people most was that secondary. People aren’t scared of that secondary, in particular tight end play. You look at Tyler Eifert and what he did with the Cincinnati Bengals – they went right over the top of this ferocious secondary…Greg Olsen got in the endzone. If you’re looking at Kam [Chancellor], you’re looking at [Richard] Sherman, you’re looking at Earl Thomas, the guys that used to make those plays aren’t making those plays. You might shutdown a receiver or two, but they need to watch out for these tight ends for the rest of the season.” \nRobinson: “They’re not finishing this year. Maybe it’s getting to a point where Pete has been there awhile, the core group of guys have been there for a while…maybe the message is running a little thin. Maybe the guys are tired of hearing the same old things in every team meeting.” \nOn the Seahawks’ motivation: \nBurleson: “I’m not going to speak on their individual motivation. I’m just saying as a team collectively it’s hard to get yourself up when you already won that championship…[Earl Thomas] also said there is some stuff that I want to talk about that I can’t say right now. You know what that tells me? There is trouble in the waters. You have guys bickering and pointing to each other, yelling in high definition – those are things we didn’t see the last couple of years.” \nOn the Seahawks defense: \nBurleson: “We also have to talk about the linebackers and pressure on quarterbacks. There are quarterbacks sitting in the pocket more confident than ever against this team. That’s a lot different than what we’ve seen in the years past. Quarterbacks used to get rattled when they faced the Seahawks. They’re not so rattled anymore.” \nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bcondotta .
