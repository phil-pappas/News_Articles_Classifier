Emerson Etem approached Tanner Glass in the Rangers’ locker room after Wednesday night’s preseason finale at the Garden. The two wingers, who seemingly are battling for the 13th and final forward spot on the regular season roster, played on the same line against the Boston Bruins.\nSo naturally Etem, 23, walked up to Glass, 31, closed his fist, and held it out with a smile.\nGood job, Etem said, with a fist-bump to his older teammate.\n“Yeah,” Glass said with a happy head-nod. “Good third.”\nUntil one of them is waived, they will be teammates. Or as Glass put it, grinning: “I’m gonna keep showing up for work here until they tell me not to.” But could there be a way for both players to be on next Tuesday’s plane to Chicago for their Wednesday night season opener?\nIt’s unlikely, but it’s possible, if only due to a hard-to-believe but conceivable scenario that could be on the table: That the Rangers may find a trading partner for veteran center Dominic Moore.\nNow, to qualify, there is no logical hockey argument behind trading Moore. Put this on the record: It would be a mistake, even with the 35-year-old making $1.5 million and due to hit unrestricted free agency in July.\nBut first-year GM Jeff Gorton can’t be interested in losing Etem ($850,000) on waivers after just acquiring him in the Carl Hagelin trade with Anaheim, and coach Alain Vigneault can’t be excited about having the hardworking but underwhelming and unreliable Etem as his only extra forward.\nWith Moore on the team, it’s Glass ($1.45 million) versus Etem for the final spot, and only one of management’s concerns goes unresolved. With Moore off the team, Glass and Etem both stay and Gorton and Vigneault address both dilemmas.\nGlass might be the odd man out except he is a winger, where the Rangers need depth, while Moore — though flexible enough to play wing — is a career center, at a position where the organization has a sudden logjam. Moore also is a tradeable commodity while Glass is not, especially with an extra year left on his current contract. A number of other variables support the scenario of a potential Moore deal, as well.\nFirst, if preseason was any indication, Vigneault loves the reliability of offseason acquisition and veteran center Jarret Stoll, and if the coach had to pick a fourth-line center, it seems clear he’d give Stoll the spot that Moore has occupied in the coach’s first two seasons in New York.\nSecondly, when Kevin Hayes moved out of the third-line center spot for a top-six trial on the wing Wednesday night, Vigneault made the interesting decision to audition rookie Oscar Lindberg at center for a second time. There would be no reason to even consider that Lindberg might play center for this year’s team unless Moore or Stoll were out of the picture.\nVigneault also has certain players that just aren’t his favorites. He’s threatening to leave J.T. Miller out of his top-six, for example, even though the young forward has had one of the best camps on the entire team. Moore is another example of Vigneault’s occasionally arbitrary impatience.\nMoore has boatloads of playoff experience, penalty-killing prowess, and a track record of elevating his game onto more prominent forward lines in consecutive Rangers postseason runs to the Cup and Eastern Conference finals. But his place still seems uncertain, especially perplexing considering Moore’s track record on face-offs.\nSigning Stoll (51% on face-offs last year) and having Moore (54.5%) finally gave the Rangers two imposing face-off men. Casting one of them out of the middle, or off the team, would negate an improvement the Rangers required.\nDerick Brassard (48.8%) is the only other respectable pivot at the dots. Derek Stepan (44.1%) only has his moments, and Hayes (36.3%) was awful in his rookie season. Perhaps Lindberg (8-of-12 for 67% on Wednesday night) is considered a solution there.\nVigneault, in fairness, did audition Moore and Stoll together on a penalty killing unit once this preseason and recalled fondly his luxury in the 2013-14 season of having strong face-off men Moore and Brian Boyle on ice together. So it’s not like the coach doesn’t see Moore’s strengths or value to a team.\nIt’s just important to understand that the Rangers’ management staff, led by Gorton and Vigneault, is extremely diligent. So when they convened on Thursday’s off day to deliberate, they undoubtedly covered every possible scenario. And this is one of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:25:03.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
