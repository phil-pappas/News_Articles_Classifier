It's plain and simple.\"\nRangers starter Derek Holland (4-3) worked into the seventh and allowing three runs on Thursday. The left-hander struck out six and gave up three hits in 6-1/3 innings.\n\"I thought Derek threw the ball very well,\" Texas manager Jeff Banister said.\n\"The ball came out clean. The breaking ball showed up again, the changeup was there and, more than anything else, there was life on the fastball.\"\nTexas closer Shawn Tolleson picked up his 35th save of the season after a perfect ninth.\n\"We've got to win one more,\" Tolleson said. \"We've got to win the West.\"\nLos Angeles starter Andrew Heaney (6-4) allowed four runs on five hits and walked five in 4-1/3 innings.\nHeaney worked around control issues with two double plays through the first four innings to keep the Rangers scoreless.\nTexas broke through in the fifth by taking advantage of Heaney's fourth and fifth walks to score four times. Beltre had the big blow, a three-run double to chase Heaney.\n\"I need to bounce that,\" Heaney said of the low slider to Beltre.\n\"I'm not surprised. That guy is really freaking good.\"\n(Compiled by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:16:10.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
