He hits on the challenges of the coming opponent, maybe breaks down – in very general, Patriots-approved non-specifics – how the offense is playing, and calls it a day. If there's a controversy or something team-wide that needs addressing, Brady's your man. \nThe 2015 season, however, has marked a shift in Brady's press conference comportment. Typically quick with a smile or patient with scores of questions, he has turned his media commitments into clipped, perfunctory affairs lasting as few as four minutes. \nSimultaneously, he has declined opportunities to appear on NBC's postgame coverage after emotional victories over the Steelers and Colts, even though the former marked not only Banner Night, but his victory in court, while the latter was billed as revenge week for Indy's role in Deflategate. \nSo what's the deal? Brady understandably seems to have some hard feelings following the beating he took this winter, and he's also at a point in his career where he feels the need to dial back on anything that's not directly related to football, as he explained to Dennis & Callahan with Minihane during his weekly appearance on Tuesday. \n\"There's a lot of requests and demand for my time,\" Brady said. \"I think since winning the last Super Bowl , a lot of different things have kind of happened with my life, just in general. I think having a concerted effort to save as much energy as I can, when I can, where I can, and to give my teammates opportunities to do some of the real cool things that I've had a chance to do over the course of my career.\" \nThe reference to his teammates is the fact that other players have conducted the postgame interviews with Michele Tafoya that typically would've been Brady's domain. \nSo what are we to make of this? For one, it's clear that Brady's keeping score following a winter of misery, and as a human being, it's hard to blame him. My personal view as a reporter is I'd always prefer if smart, perceptive athletes like Brady speak more rather than less. We get stories people want to read, and fans get insight into the state of the team. \nThat said, he's obviously well within his rights to say as little as he wants, and I never got too worked up over putting a stopwatch on press conferences. If he talks, great. If he doesn't, we can still do our jobs. And yes, merely broaching this topic runs the risk of Narcissus-level navel-gazing. \nTwo facets of this interest me, however. First of all, blowing off the broadcast partners can pretty easily be interpreted as a shot at the NFL, the league that made the perplexing decision to go to the mattresses over Deflategate in the first place. Brady without question will do everything in his power to put a winning product on the field, but it looks like that's where his responsibilities end, which is also why I doubt he lost any sleep over disparaging NFL advertisers Coke and Frosted Flakes by referring to their products as, \"poison\" and \"not a food,\" respectively, during last week's WEEI interview. \nLocally, however, Brady's truncated press conferences are coming at the expense of a press corps that almost universally rallied behind him throughout Deflategate, often going to great lengths to defend him. His most vocal critics were mostly national, with the exception of a couple of columnists and the stray radio personality. \nEarlier this season on D&C, Brady hinted that he'd be devoting less time to interviews. \n\"It's a long season anyway, but the more things that I do -- non-Patriots related really to help other people out -- those things take away from the energy that I may have to do other things,\" Brady said. \"I've always tried to fulfill different obligations for people and different times it's hard to fulfill all of them. I get a lot of requests. Things that may be public or private and then I just try and make those decisions based on how the week is, but it's hard to fulfill them all. We'll see how that goes this year.\" \nI'm quite certain most Patriots fans could not care less whether Brady speaks for two minutes or 20 on Wednesday. His play on the field says all they need to hear. \nBut as we consider the lasting impact of Deflategate, Brady's reduced media dealings reinforce the notion that he has entered the bunker, and if things go his way, maybe he won't emerge until the second week of February in San Francisco.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:10:03.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
