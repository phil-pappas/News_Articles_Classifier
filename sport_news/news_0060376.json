Despite the narrow margin, the Blackhawks trailed by five points early in two games that they eventually came back to win. \n“It defiently shows the caliber of the kind of team we are,” said FA head coach Liz Colver on the closeness of the games. “However, going into the postseason, we cannot put ourselves into that predicament. It shows a lack of discipline when we allow them to get those points on us.” \nThe Blackhawks (8-5, 3-3 Badger South), which received a No. 5 seed in the upcoming WIAA Division 1 tournament, are set to face similar stiff competition as Colver eluded too. First up is No. 12 Kenosha Bradford, who will be a test for the up-and-down Fort Atkinson team. \nBut the real challenge will come should they reach the WIAA Division 1 Regional semifinals against Badger South rival Milton, which boasts a 13-4 record and also beat the Blackhawks in a five-game match early in September. \nColver said it comes down to control and the kind of mentality her team decides to have on a given night. Fortunately for Colver, the mentality proved to be on a high note in their match. \n“We went out and planned to attack the ball,” Colver said. “We did not want our opponents to attack us and most importantly we always want to control the pace of the game.” \nControl is something Colver stressed to her team all night especially leading up to the fifth and final game of the night. \n“Eventually our luck was going to run out if we kept leaving it up to chance,” Colver said before her team took the court for the fifth game. “I told them that they needed to control the ball every time it comes over to our side. It is up to us to do what we want with it.” \nThe final game ended in the Blackhawks winning 15-7, with Katie Frohmader and senior outside hitter Juila Hanson collecting the majority of the kills. \n“(Frohmader) is a great leader and you almost think she is a senior out there,” Colver said. “She struggled tonight too and that is where you see her mentality. She is a tough kid and struggled with her service receive, but was able to move her feet and make up for it on her serving, blocking and offense. She is vital to our program.” \nFrohmader led the team with four aces and added 13 kills behind Hanson’s 19. \n“When (Hansen) is on the service line she can rally and put down a couple points when you need it,” Colver said. “When she gets fired up she can put the ball down on the outside and she truly is an exciting player to watch because when she is on she can dominate the game.” \nAlthough Waunakee played scrappy defense all night, including some dive saves and pancakes that led to momentum-changing points, Colver said it comes back to who controls the ball and the game because good things happen to those who play together. \nFort Atkinson senior libero Arielle Hatchel took that personally, digging kill after Waunakee kill in the final game. She tallied six digs in that game to add to her game-high 27 digs. She also was able to contribute three serves that gave Fort an early 4-1 lead. \n“(Arielle) has worked all season to earn her position,” Colver said. “She is starting to move better and pass better.” \nColver said that for her team to return to sectionals like they did last season she is going to need the Blackhawks to play the best ball possible. \n“At this point in the season they need to decide how they are going to play and they need to decide what is acceptable for them,” Colver said. \nThursday’s WIAA Division 1 begins Regional semifinal begins at 7 p.m. at PremierBank Gymnasium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:11:28.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
