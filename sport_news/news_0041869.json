NJSIAA has received a complaint. NJSIAA requested an investigation and report from East Orange,\" Goodell said. \"NJSIAA is waiting for that report and once it receives it, it will review it to determine whether there are sufficient facts to require a hearing.” \nGoodell said that the NJSIAA was investigating, \"generically, out of season coaching,\" and that the organization expects to receive the report within a week. Requesting an investigation into complaints is standard policy for the NJSIAA. \nAdam Zagoria of SNY.tv tweeted on Friday that Lovett had been suspended by the NJSIAA for two years for \" intentionally playing two ineligible players; housing a player; and playing a kid who didn't attend East Orange High. \" \n\"NJSIAA has not taken any formal action other than to ask for an investigation and report,\" Goodell said. \"I have no idea what the school has done, if anything. I know that we’re waiting for the report and we’re anxious to get it.\" \nWhen reached by phone on Friday by NJ Advance Media, Lovett denied all wrongdoing and said that no punishment had been administered. \n\"I haven't heard anything in regards to it. I haven't heard anything from the school, I haven't heard anything from the state. No one at the school at East Orange has said anything to me,\" Lovett said. \"There's been no hearing, there's been nothing.\" \nStaff writer Matthew Stanmyre contributed to this report. \nJeremy Schneider may be reached at jschneider@njadvancemedia.com .
