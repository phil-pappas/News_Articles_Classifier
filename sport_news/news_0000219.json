Sometimes you make them and are not punished. We were punished,\" he told reporters.\n\"We watch dozens of repetitions of Porto taking corners. We were completely ready for that and in a moment when the game is under control we concede a goal that is ridiculous.\n\"We had another mistake similar when they hit the post. Apart from that the performance was balanced. The players reacted in a positive way and tried to play in a positive way. It's a difficult opponent, a difficult place to play. Champions League brings a different emotion to matches.\"\nThe result leaves Chelsea third in Group G with three points, behind both Porto and Dynamo Kiev.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:38:37.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
