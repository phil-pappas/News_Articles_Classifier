He made a fair catch on three of Collin Barber’s first four punts, with the other one being downed. \nOn the play in question, Hilton was hit by Malcom Mitchell just milliseconds after catching the ball, and Malkom Parrish recovered the ball on Missouri’s 43. \nMissouri was running a punt-block play, meaning there weren’t many blockers back to protect Hilton. \n“Generally, unless it’s a real poor kick, you’re probably going to have to fair-catch that,” Pinkel said. “So that’s just little things freshmen do.” \nHilton said he wasn’t expecting a flag at the time. \n“At first I was kind of like, ‘Oh, what am I doing?’” he said. “But then when I looked at it on film, I was like, ‘Oh, that was pretty clear (it was a penalty).’” \nHilton said it was “kind of relieving” to hear the wrong call was made. \n“I was more frustrated with myself, but it kind of takes some off me,” he said. \nWith Missouri’s offense failing to move the ball — the Tigers didn’t score a touchdown for the second straight game — Hilton said his approach to punt returning was a bit more aggressive than it might have been otherwise. \n“I always want to be a playmaker,” he said, “so that was definitely going through my head.” \nPenton’s penalty came on a first-down pass attempt to Mitchell. Greyson Lambert’s throw sailed out of bounds, but Missouri’s junior cornerback was flagged for defensive pass interference nonetheless. \n“I just think the ball was uncatchable,” Penton said. \nThe penalty essentially put Georgia in field-goal range, and after gaining 7 more yards, Morgan made what turned out to be the game-winning kick. Penton, meanwhile, was kicking himself. \n“I’m supposed to feel that way,” he said, “because (of the) moment that call was made on that particular drive.” \nPenton said he tried not to let the penalty affect the way he played the rest of the game. \n“You have to be yourself out there, and that’s why you’re here,” he said. “But other than that, if you just stay mentally prepared and focused you’ll be fine.” \nAt that point, however, it didn’t matter much how Penton played. Georgia didn’t need to attempt another pass. \nNotes: Junior quarterback Maty Mauk remains absent from the Missouri depth chart, with the newest one released Monday. True freshman Drew Lock will start his fourth consecutive game Saturday at Vanderbilt. The Tigers are 1-2 without Mauk, who was suspended indefinitely Sept. 29 for a violation of team policy. … Tight end Sean Culkin was listed as the first-string tight end. Culkin, who injured his knee Sept. 26 at Kentucky, was listed as questionable last week but played at Georgia, catching two balls for 16 yards. … True freshman Emanuel Hall is listed as a co-starter with J’Mon Moore at X receiver. Missouri has already started true freshmen at quarterback (Lock), receiver (Cam Hilton), defensive tackle (Terry Beckner Jr.), punter (Corey Fatony) and punt returner (Hilton) this season. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:09:57.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
