ALCS Royals Blue Jays Baseball Kansas City Royals starting pitcher Johnny Cueto leaves the game against the Toronto Blue Jays during the third inning in Game 3 of baseball's American League Championship Series on Monday, Oct. 19, 2015, in Toronto. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Paul Sancya) Comments \nJohnny Cueto lost Game 3 of the American League Championship Series on Monday night and might have cost himself some offseason cash, too. \nIn his third start of the postseason, Cueto was knocked around for eight runs in two innings of work as the Blue Jays won 11-8 in Toronto to cut into the Royals' 2-1 series lead. \nCueto gave up six runs in the third inning on a single, double and homer and was pulled before retiring a batter. \nIt marked Cueto's worst start of the playoffs, and only one of his previous two starts in the American League Division Series was strong. \nIn Game 1 of the ALDS against Houston, Cueto gave up four runs on seven hits in six innings. He stepped up when it mattered in Game 5 to hold Houston to two runs on two hits over eight innings to win the series, but his postseason ERA in these three starts sits at 7.88. \nWhile Cueto had a 3.44 ERA with 176 strikeouts and 44 walks in 212 innings between Cincinnati and Kansas City, the postseason numbers play a big factor when teams are looking to bid for his services this offseason. \nThe Red Sox need an ace and Cueto is likely on their list of free-agent starters but starts like the one Monday night, especially against an AL East team in Toronto, don't bode well for the Red Sox. \nThe Royals traded for Cueto at the deadline to bolster their staff for the playoffs but he hasn't helped much yet. \nMeanwhile, Cueto had elbow problems earlier this season. \nUnless he performs spectacularly through the rest of the playoffs, the Red Sox would be wise to skip on the 29-year-old righthander and focus their efforts and money elsewhere. \nAnd other teams might follow suit, dropping the price for Cueto, which in turn might make other free-agent starters like David Price more coveted and more expensive. \nFollow MassLive.com Red Sox beat reporter @jcmccaffrey on Twitter.
