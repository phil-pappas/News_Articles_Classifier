(AP) — Pacific Classic winner Beholder has galloped at Santa Anita for the last time before heading to Kentucky for the Breeders’ Cup. \nThe two-time Eclipse Award winner was on the track Sunday and is scheduled to ship to Keeneland early Monday. Trainer Richard Mandella plans one workout for her there before she is scheduled to face Triple Crown champion American Pharoah in the Breeders’ Cup Classic on Oct. 31. \nAmerican Pharoah also galloped Sunday. Trainer Bob Baffert says the colt will have another workout on Tuesday. He has not yet finalized shipping plans to Kentucky. \nBeholder has 15 wins in 20 career starts and earnings of over $4.4 million. She won the $1 million Pacific Classic against male horses by 8 1/4 lengths in August at Del Mar, and she won the Grade 1 Zenyatta Stakes for the third straight year on Sept. 26 at Santa Anita.
