While the Falcons led much of the game, turnovers came back to bite them in the end during the 25-18 loss. \n“We have to protect the football. You can’t expect to win when you turn the ball over five times,” Los Fresnos coach Clint Finley said. “It was disappointing and it hurt, but it’s a lesson that we’re going to take from it. Hopefully we can use that to our benefit in the future.” \nRivera is searching for its first win and has struggled on both sides of the ball. The Raiders beat Los Fresnos last season after the Falcons were coming off a big win against Harlingen High the week before. Rivera doesn’t have the same punch as it did one season ago, but the Falcons haven’t forgotten last year’s loss either. \n“I expect a tough, hard-fought game,” Finley said. “We have to make sure that doesn’t happen to us and we learn from the mistakes from last year. Hopefully we can be a little bit better prepared and more ready to play because we’re going to get their best shot.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
