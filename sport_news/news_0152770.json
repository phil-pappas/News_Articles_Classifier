The difference between Tuesday in the practice round, how well they played, and yesterday -- the mood was just not there. \n\n\"I to go to those guys and say, relax, try and play golf, and just go out there and do what you did so well throughout the year to get you to this team. \n\n\"I'm really proud of the way my team played today. It was a big turnaround, and I think all the youngsters on the team learnt an awful lot.\" \n\nPrice admitted that 25-year-old New Zealander Danny Lee, who was born just a few kilometres away from the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club in Incheon, was too \"strung out\" with tension to play his best golf, despite winning his match with South Korea's Bae Sang-Moon who sunk a snaking 12-footer on the final green. \n\n\"I think we even saw today, Danny Lee, who is so into this week, he's so strung out. The guy is trying so hard,\" said Price. \n\n\"I must admit, that putt that Sang-Moon made on 18 today, was probably the highlight of the last two days for us.\" \n\nSouth African pair Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace got the ball rolling Friday by beating Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson 4 and 3 for their second win of the week. \n\nThey will again be out first in Saturday morning's foursomes, up against Patrick Reed and Rickie Fowler. \n\nThe US team's Bubba Watson and J.B Holmes have also had two wins out of two and they will face the all-Australian pairing of Adam Scott and Marc Leishman. \n\nBae was rewarded for his fine display Friday on a course on which he has won twice as a professional by being selected to team up with Japan's Hideki Matsuyama against Bill Haas and Matt Kuchar. \n\nThe final match of the morning finally sees a face off between the number one and two players in the world, Spieth and Jason Day, when they team up with Dustin Johnson and Charl Schwartzel respectively.
