In reality, they face elimination, down three games to the Mets in the NLCS. But there’s still hope in the Windy City.While many Cubs fans wore long faces as they exited Wrigley Field Tuesday night, some were still spouting hope.“I think they got a good shot at winning the next game,” one fan said Tuesday.Among the hopeful was Cubs President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein.“It’s been done before, rumor has it,” he said.Epstein was at the helm of the Boston Red Sox when they roared back to win four straight in the 2004 ALCS.“We’ve done it. Nine winning streaks of four or more games this year,” Epstein said.But manager Joe Maddon says it all has to start with a win Wednesday.“It’s not easy. I totally agree with you there. It’s just it really comes down — that we have to pitch equally as well, if not just a little bit better better. Not easy to do. We’ve done it this year at different times,” Maddon said after Tuesday’s game.Cubs' outfielder Kyle Schwarber admitted the Cubs' offense is struggling, but, he added, things can turn around quickly for the club. “You can only control what you can control. So, you know, it’s — it is a little frustrating, but things can turn around just like that.”Maddon says Cubs’ starter Jason Hammel will pitch in Game 4 on Wednesday against the Mets' Steven Matz, and that they'll go to the bullpen early if necessary.
