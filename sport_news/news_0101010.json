And his response is so classless, he didn’t really come across as believable either. \nBut ultimately, yeah, I’d like to see some proof as well. I think we’ve heard all we need to know when it comes to determining whether some of this stuff went on up there (it did). But if she accuses him, specifically, she might want to be prepared to back that up with proof. He could sue her for libel.

It’s one thing to say this kind of stuff around your buddies, but to say this stuff to the media is pretty ridiculous. I would say that I’m embarrassed for him, but I’m really not.
