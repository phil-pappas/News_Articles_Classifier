All NFL games \nGreen Bay — Of the many differences between wide receiver Jeff Janis and cornerback Quinten Rollins, their physical size is what makes their special-teams performances so interesting. \nAt 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, Janis is both the biggest and fastest receiver for the Green Bay Packers. He is as close as you'll find to a Jordy Nelson clone in terms of appearance, and the jet fuel in his legs produces eye-popping 4.42 seconds in the 40-yard dash. \nRollins, a second-round pick by the Packers in 2015, is a compact ball of muscle. He measures in at 5-11 and 190 pounds with a pedestrian time of 4.54 seconds in the 40. \n\"They are different,\" special teams coordinator Ron Zook said. \nBut for all their discrepancies in height, weight, speed and position, Janis and Rollins have developed into an exciting pair of gunners for the Packers on special teams. Tasked with careening downfield to ensnare the opposing team's punt returner, the unlikely tandem has combined to make five special teams tackles — nearly 25% of the Packers' total — and catalyze a unit that ranks 14th in the NFL in fewest punt return yards allowed. \n\"Our tenacity and our willingness to get down there and defeat blocks and stuff makes us successful out there,\" Rollins said. \nWhat makes their early season performance more impressive is the fact that neither player had any experience at the gunner position prior to this season. Rollins played just one year of college football at Miami (Ohio), while Janis focused almost exclusively on receiver, finishing as the all-time leader in receptions (241), receiving yards (4,274) and receiving touchdowns (46) at Saginaw Valley State. \nTheir paths met as gunners for punter Tim Masthay, whose kicks they would chase at full speed in hopes of making a quick and precise tackle to limit a potential return. That is, of course, if they could get off the line of scrimmage. \n\"It's definitely about the release,\" Rollins said. \nWith one gunner on each side of the formation, the punt return team makes a choice about whether to line up one or two players across the line of scrimmage to defend. The St. Louis Rams, who travel to Green Bay on Sunday, are what Zook described as a \"return-philosophy team,\" meaning at least one of the gunners, either Rollins or Janis, is likely to see a constant double-team. (Zook also labeled Rams' returner Tavon Austin the most complete return man the Packers have faced this season.) \nThe ability of a gunner to win what amounts to a hand-to-hand battle on the perimeter is a major indication of the overall success of the play. Janis and Rollins do everything in their power — they will tell you the referees ignore holding and grabbing in this particular part of the game — to nullify the attempted jam by the opposition to begin an all-out sprint toward the ball. \n\"It's definitely a dogfight,\" Rollins said. \"...But at the same time it's that much more fun because it's just one play where you can really just go all out and don't have any worries.\" \nThe ultimate reward is slithering through a double-team. \n\"That's the best feeling in the world because you're really not supposed to beat a double-team,\" Rollins said. \"To know that you fought, competed and got off, beat two men whose sole job was to stop you. You get down there and you disrupt the play, you can't do nothing but be proud of that.\" \nWhile Rollins' opportunity as a gunner resulted from an injury to defensive back Demetri Goodson, Janis was essentially handpicked by the coaching staff. Mired near the bottom of the receiver depth chart, Janis viewed special teams as a way to impress the coaches with effort and, he hopes, convince them to give him more reps on offense. \nThrough four games, his performance can be described as phenomenal at best and impressive at worst. Janis is tied with linebacker Jayrone Elliott for the most special teams tackles on the team, and their totals of four tackles each are tied for the third-highest total in the NFL. \n\"That's something that I'm taking pride in,\" Janis said, \"And I want to bring some energy to the team.\" \nThey are likely to take the field again Sunday, two players learning on the fly but with a world of desire and feistiness. Masthay will punt, their arms will thrash and, a few seconds later, either Janis or Rollins hopes to make a crucial tackle down the field. \n\"It takes speed, it takes quickness, it takes strength, it takes toughness,\" Zook said. \"That's a tough job.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
