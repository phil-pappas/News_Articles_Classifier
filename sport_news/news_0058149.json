Comment Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 9:37 PM Cheboygan, Mich. By JARED GREENLEAF sports@cheboygantribune.com CHEBOYGAN — Cheboygan head coach Dave Schulz has been through this before — he’s dealt with teams that were consistently on the losing end. But the message has always been the same from Schulz to his players, no matter what the circumstances are. “That each day, each practice they need to play their best at each thing they’ve got to do,” explained Schulz. “They need to make the next play the next game, make it your best one that you’ve ever done, just keep moving forward and not to think about the whole thing. There’s no time to dwell on it, it is what it is.” It’s been more than frustrating for the reeling Chiefs (1-6), who will head into Friday’s 7 p.m. season finale against Remus-Chippewa Hills (6-2) on a five-game losing streak, averaging just 6.6 points per game during that span. “It’s frustrating, but it’s nothing that you really keep with you each week, you really try to get things going and focused on that week and not so much of, ‘Is it going to happen again,’” Schulz added. “You just move things forward.” Cheboygan’s final home game of the season — and more importantly, its final game as an independent — will come against a Chippewa Hills program that handed the Chiefs a 42-6 thrashing last season. The playoff-bound Warriors used a dynamic offensive attack and strong defensive performance to handle the Chiefs in what was the final game for then Cheboygan head coach Jack Coon. “Overall, they’re very sound fundamentally both offensively and defensively,” Schulz said of Chippewa Hills. “They can run the ball, pass the ball, they’ve got good speed at quarterback. The kid makes a lot of plays, so the challenge will be to contain him.” That player the Chiefs will be looking to slow down is quarterback DeAngelo Lowery, who is a dual-threat that can hurt you with both his arm and legs. “He can definitely throw, but we’ve seen a few quarterbacks on different teams even back to the Sault,” Schulz said of Lowery. “There’s some dynamic players that we’re going up against. Is he going to be the best one? Time will tell, we’ll see. I think we feel very prepared because we’ve played a lot of good teams this year, so it’s not like we have to get up and change anything we’re really trying to do to prepare. We’re getting ready to play another good football team and we’re going to do everything we can to win that game.” Page 2 of 3 - After starting quickly with a touchdown on their first drive, the Chiefs struggled to put up points — a common theme this fall — during a 41-7 loss at Bay City John Glenn last week. In his team’s final game this season, Schulz is hoping the points will finally come against a talented Chippewa Hills defense. “On offense, it’s about sustaining drives and putting the ball in the endzone,” Schulz said. “I mean it’s what we’ve been preaching and trying to do all we, and we just want to make this week our best game, play our best and be proud of what we did.” With senior quarterback Zach Socha out due to injury last week, it was junior Mike Radle getting the start for the Chiefs, leading the team to a touchdown on its first possession. But with Socha returning to practice this week, Schulz is undecided on who will be the starter Friday. “It’s a matter of who’s going to be able to step in there and execute the offense to give us the best change to win,” Schulz said. “Zach’s definitely looking good again and getting back to where he was before he got hurt. “Mike Radle did a good job starting his first game as a varsity quarterback, the first drive he led the team to a score. That was a great sign that the system of what we’re doing is being passed on from each kid and they’re learning, and we just kind of use each kid in our system to their strengths.” In addition to it not being a winning season for the Chiefs, it also hasn’t been a healthy one for a team that’s suffered several key injuries over the course of the fall. “It’s frustrating and you feel bad for the boys who get injured because they want to be in there, but as a coach, it’s a matter of making sure the next guy is ready to play,” Schulz explained. “It’s not too challenging from that standpoint, it’s just mentally frustrating because those kids want to be out there playing their best, and when they don’t get to, it’s the next guy’s opportunity.” Friday night will mark the final game for the Cheboygan senior players that include Alex Chasse, Ryan Dorey, Brandon Heath, Tristan Jarman, Garrett Lindgren, Logan Mills, Dalton Oikarinen, Dan Pearson, Dominic Reese, Dylan Shampine, Austin Sidelinker, Zach Socha, Dylan Socolovitch and Travis Thompson. If there’s one thing Schulz’s been proud of with his senior players, it’s been their ability to keep a strong mindset during a difficult campaign. Page 3 of 3 - “They’re very resilient,” Schulz said. “They’ve had to deal with losses before, but it doesn’t change their work ethic. They don’t let it define who they are. It fuels them to do better and do more the next time. I’m proud of that aspect of the senior class and just their resiliency that they’ve shown week to week.” Even though Friday will be the final game for the Cheboygan seniors, Schulz said they probably might not feel the moment until perhaps down the road. “It’s special right now because it’s their last game, but I don’t think it sinks in for months or years down the road of what this really was, the opportunity they had,” Schulz said. “That stuff you learn over time, so they’re a little young to understand how these things kinda come to an end. They’re just going to go out there and play another football game the best that they can, try to play their best and make themselves and their team and parents proud, and when it’s over, it’ll start to hit them a little bit that was the final time. It’s nothing that’s going to shape how they play, they play hard every week, whether it’s last or their second or whatever game it is.” WCBY Radio will carry the Chippewa Hills-Cheboygan football game on Friday.
