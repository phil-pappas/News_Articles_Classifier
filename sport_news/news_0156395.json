They have not won since a victory at Everton last May.\nThe manager had hinted strongly at his intentions on Saturday when he refused to confirm he was staying at the club after the West Ham game.\nSunderland had led 2-0 before having their second goalscorer Jeremain Lens sent off in the second half and allowing the Hammers to walk away with a point.\nThe decision to step down almost certainly spells retirement for Advocaat, who moved into coaching after a low-key playing career as a midfielder spent mainly in the Netherlands.\nAppointed assistant to Dutch national coach Rinus Michels in 1984, he became head coach and took the Netherlands to the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 1994 before returning to club coaching with PSV Eindhoven in 1995.\nHe won his first trophy, the Dutch Cup, a year later, before adding the Dutch Championship in 1997.\nAdvocaat led Rangers to a Scottish treble in 1999 before leaving in 2002 to follow a nomadic career as both a national and club manager which included the distinction of becoming the first foreign coach to win the Russian Premier League title with Zenit St Petersburg in 2007.\nHe guided Zenit to victory in the 2008 UEFA Cup final against his old club Rangers to become the first foreigner to be made an Honorary Citizen of St Petersburg since 1866.\n 04, 2015 11:20 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T05:43:39.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
