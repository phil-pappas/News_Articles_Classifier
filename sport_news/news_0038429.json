He says the money was unpaid additional salary from his job as Blatter's adviser between 1998 and 2002.\nBefore Thursday's meeting, several European associations said they wanted more details on why Platini waited nine years to collect the money, which was not covered by a written contract. It was unclear if they received the answers they wanted.\nPlatini's lawyer took questions at Thursday's meeting of the UEFA members and the executive committee, where it was decided not to withdraw backing for its leader of eight years.\n\"We support Michel Platini's right to a due process and a fair trial and to the opportunity to clear his name,\" UEFA said in a statement it said was agreed to by the executive committee and 54 members.\nAustrian federation president Leo Windtner confirmed that \"all nations give all support to Mr. Platini\" in a unified position.\nPlatini is appealing against the interim suspension, but even if that is lifted he would still be facing the full verdict on the case by FIFA's ethics judge.\n\"We strongly call on all instances involved in the current process: FIFA's Ethics Committee, FIFA's Appeal Committee and ultimately the Court of Arbitration for Sport to work very rapidly to ensure that there is a final decision on the merits of the case by, at the latest, mid-November 2015,\" the UEFA statement said.\nFIFA investigators have not yet been convinced there was even an oral agreement between Platini and Blatter for the unpaid debt called in at the start of 2011. Platini said he did not receive his full salary by 2002 because FIFA could not afford to pay him.\nPlatini has not produced a written contract to show the money was owed to him. Because of his ban from any role in soccer, Platini was not allowed to attend Thursday's meeting. The payment is also being investigated by the Swiss attorney general.\nHours before being suspended last week, Platini submitted his election paperwork to FIFA.\n\"Michel Platini is already a candidate for the FIFA presidency,\" Infantino said, overlooking the fact that status is only declared by FIFA's election committee.\nPrince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan is the only other hopeful to formally submit his candidacy to FIFA, which includes nominations from five federations.\nUEFA executives are still discussing whether another candidate should be put forward as a backup in case Platini is ineligible.\nAs UEFA members met Thursday, Hayatou spent his first day at FIFA headquarters in Zurich as acting president and addressed the staff.\n\"It's certainly an unprecedented situation for FIFA,\" Hayatou said in comments provided by FIFA. \"But we remain focused on the necessary reform process, the presidential election and on supporting the current investigations. To restore public trust is a crucial objective. It is essential that FIFA carries on its mission of developing the game and staging international tournaments.\"\n___\nFollow Rob Harris at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\nCopyright The Associated Press\nMore News Videos From Our News Partners Father learns to walk again so he can take daughter down the aisle on her wedding day Koko the gorilla receives kittens for 44th birthday Man gets 5 years for showercam, says it was for watching chickens Man crushed by 16-pound pine cone sues park for $5 million Mark Hamill denies flubbing Star Wars lines", "external_links": ["http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js\\", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/js/handlebars-v3.0.0.js\\", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/daytondailynews/hbs/cinesport_grid_items.hbs", "http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/man-crushed-16-pound-pinecone-sues-park-5-million/nn3xj/", "http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/national/father-learns-walk-again-so-he-can-take-daughter-d/nn394/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/15/d9/87/ce5bed2d57e445f59f89271de9e4b627\\u002D8823e7ef0a204cdabdde7344b577f458\\u002D1.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/15/71/aa/ce5bed2d57e445f59f89271de9e4b627\\u002D76de67ab18014d5e8de9a6b89169d0f5\\u002D1.jpg", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/cache/cacher.php?saveas=ddn_cinesport_main&format=rss&json_url=", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/php/simple_get_file.php?url=", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/15/b3/0e/ce5bed2d57e445f59f89271de9e4b627\\u002D8823e7ef0a204cdabdde7344b577f458\\u002D0.jpg", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://www.krmg.com/news/news/national/man-gets-5-years-showercam-says-it-was-watching-ch/nn3wy/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/15/89/da/ce5bed2d57e445f59f89271de9e4b627\\u002D76de67ab18014d5e8de9a6b89169d0f5\\u002D2.jpg", "http://www.wftv.com/news/entertainment/movies/did-he-or-didnt-he-mark-hamill-denies-flubbing-sta/nn322/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:07:48.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
