They also complained about body and sunroof squeaks, rattles and leaks.\n“As the older vehicles are getting up on miles we are seeing some where the electric motor needs to be replaced and the onboard charging system won’t charge the battery,” said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports’ director of automotive testing. “On the newer vehicles we are seeing problems such as the sunroof not operating properly. Door handles continue to be an issue.”\nFisher said the flaws could signal future problems for the brand, which plans to roughly double production next year. It has just begun deliveries of a second vehicle, the Model X electric crossover , and intends to introduce the Model 3, a smaller, less expensive electric car, in 2017.\nTesla Model S P85D: The D is like nothing else on the road Robert Duffer Certain experiences promise a thrill: roller coasters, free fall, love.

The D goes 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds, making...\n(Robert Duffer) Through the first nine months of the year, the automaker has delivered only 33,117 vehicles. Current Tesla models sell for about $100,000.\n“Going forward this poses the question whether they will be able to keep quality up as they increase volume and add models to the mix,” he said.\nThe risk is significant because the vehicles are becoming more complex, he said. For example, a signature feature of the Model X are “Falcon Wing” doors that swing out and fold up. Fisher asked how reliable those will be if Tesla is already having trouble with door handles.\nWhile wealthy Tesla owners are likely to have other cars, making problems less of a hassle, if Tesla reaches its 2020 goal of selling several hundred thousand Model 3s annually, buyers might not be as forgiving, Fisher said.\nTesla finally unveils the Model X all-electric SUV Tribune wire reports Electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors has mastered the sporty two-seater and the elegant sedan.

Now it wants to conquer the family hauler.\nAfter nearly two years of delays, the official launch of the Tesla Model X — one of the only all-electric SUVs on the market — on Tuesday night near the company's...\n(Tribune wire reports) Tesla spokesman Ricardo Reyes said the Palo Alto automaker keeps in close communication with its customers to “proactively address issues, and quickly fix problems.”\nHe noted that over-the-air software updates allow Tesla to diagnose and fix most bugs without the need to come in for service.\n“In instances when hardware needs to be fixed, we strive to make it painless,” Reyes said. “Consumer Reports also found that customers rate Tesla service as the best in the world.”\nConsumer Reports slammed Tesla’s Model S on reliability even though it loves the way the car drives.\nJust last month the magazine awarded one version of the car – the all-wheel-drive Tesla Model S P85D – 103 points, a tally so high it broke the Consumer Reports road test ratings system. Its driving performance was better than any other car vehicle the magazine has evaluated.\nBut Fisher said road-test scores are based on the performance, comfort and road manners of the cars Consumer Reports buys and evaluates.\nThey are separate from CR's new-car predicted-reliability scores. A great-performing vehicle still might be a service nightmare while an uninspiring, appliance-like model could be trouble-free.\nThe Model S ratings are not representative of new technology electric cars, Consumer Reports noted. Nissan’s electric Leaf earned average reliability marks this year and generally has rated above average in previous years.\nWhile Consumer Reports graded the Model S, it didn’t officially include Tesla in its annual ranking of 28 auto brands because until last month the car company had only one vehicle in the market.\nBut if it were scored as a brand, the automaker would have placed 19th between Acura and GMC, Consumer Reports said.\nLexus was the top brand for reliability. The rankings of the other brands with better-than-average reliability are second-place Toyota followed by Audi, Mazda, Subaru, Kia and Buick.\nBrands with average reliability are Honda followed by Hyundai, Mini, BMW, Volvo, Volkswagen, Porsche and Nissan.\nThose that were least reliable are Lincoln followed by Ford, Acura, GMC, Chevrolet, Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, Dodge, Infiniti and Cadillac.\nThe worst of the bunch were Ram followed by Jeep and Fiat.\nThe 2015 Annual Auto Reliability Survey relied on data from more than 740,000 vehicles.\n“We’ve seen a number of brands struggle with new transmission technology,” Fisher said, including systems such as a dual-clutch gearbox, a continuously variable transmission and transmissions with eight or nine speeds.\nBut some manufacturers are getting it right. Audi and BMW have reliable dual-clutch transmissions, while the CVTs in Honda and Toyota hybrids have been strong performers.\nLexus collected top reliability marks for all seven vehicle lines scored in the Consumer Reports survey. Buick was the only domestic brand in the top 10 coming in seventh place. Fiat-Chrysler products were the worst, taking five of the seven bottom spots.\n“We’re significantly accelerating our pace of improvement for our entire product lineup,” said Matt Liddane, vice president of quality, FCA North America. “We compete with many other global players in an industry that’s always evolving and is certainly not standing still; so, we need to continue to push harder.”\nFor more automotive news, follow me on Twitter ( @LATimesJerry ) and Facebook .\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune UPDATE 10:10 a.m.: This article has been updated with Tesla's stock price.\nThis article was first published at 9:45 a.m.\nAutomotive Industry Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Auto Reviews Tesla Motors Chrysler Honda Motor Co.
