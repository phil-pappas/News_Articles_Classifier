PELZMAN Buy this photo RECORD FILE PHOTO Running back Stevan Ridley, recovering from a knee injury, hopes to play Sunday when the Jets face the Patriots. \nFLORHAM PARK – Stevan Ridley’s narrative has been set up perfectly. \nNow all he needs is for the Jets’ coaching staff to sign off on it. \nRidley, who suffered a major knee injury last October in his fourth and final season with New England, has been on the physically unable to perform list since the beginning of training camp. By NFL rule, he sat out the first six weeks of the season. \nHe is eligible to return to game action Sunday against — of all teams — the Patriots. \n\"The story couldn’t be written any better,\" Ridley said Thursday after practice. \"I’m fired up about it. It’s my distant family. I’ve got so many friends that are over there. Just to say that I went out a year ago and I’m coming back this week against my old team, it’s kind of crazy. I don’t think you could make a movie any better than that.\" \nBut for that movie to be produced, Ridley must continue to impress the coaches in what amounts to the NFL’s version of a pitch meeting — practice. \nCoach Todd Bowles was noncommittal Thursday, saying it’s \"possible\" Ridley could be moved off the PUP list and onto the 53-man roster in time for Sunday. \nThe Jets may need a running back for the game, considering that second-stringer Bilal Powell hasn’t practiced this week because of a sprained ankle. \n\"It all depends on what we determine, whether we need a third or fourth back and those types of things,\" Bowles said. \"[Ridley] ran around more [Thursday]. Again, he’s been out for a while.\" \n\"He looks OK,\" offensive coordinator Chan Gailey said. \"You don’t see the same burst that you saw, but you shouldn’t. That’s got to come, and I think it will come. You can see flashes that he has good feet and he has good balance and good vision, but just that little burst isn’t quite there yet.\" \nRidley tore the ACL and the MCL in his right knee on Oct. 12, 2014, and missed the rest of the season. \nRidley rushed for 2,817 yards, 22 touchdowns and a 4.3-yard average while with New England. Yet the Patriots chose not to re-sign the free agent, perhaps over concerns about his knee, and he agreed to a deal with the Jets in April. \n\"That’s an obvious question, man,\" Ridley said when asked if there would be extra incentive in playing against his former team, one that didn’t want him anymore. \"I’m motivated, of course, because I’m a competitor. I’m motivated because I’m going against my old team. I’m motivated because this is my first game back. \n\"It’s in the bank of motivation for me,\" he added. \"That’s a team I was connected to and I’m no longer there. So guess what? I’m with my new team, with my new boys, and I’m with a new team that’s doing tremendous.\" \nThe Jets have started 4-1 for the first time since 2010 and are trying to match that team’s 5-1 record. A victory Sunday would mark their first regular-season road win over the Patriots since 2008. \n\"I’m just trying to come in here and find my role,\" Ridley said, \"and what my job’s going to be going forward. All I can do is work hard and hopefully I can slide in there and get in the rotation. … How much I’ll play is totally up to coach [Bowles]. I’m fine with whatever he calls. If it’s two plays, if it’s 20 plays, whatever this team needs. That’s the kind of player I am.\" \nEmail: pelzman@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:59:20.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
