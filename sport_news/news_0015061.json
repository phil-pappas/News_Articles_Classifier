While many players falter at this point in the year following a long and busy season, the World Number One only seems to get stronger. \nThe dominant Serb has won 13 matches in a row dating back to his victory at the US Open, and has not lost more than five games in a match since the start of the China Open last week.Djokovic in the red had never lost to Lopez in their six previous meetings, and he wasn't about to start now. Despite getting run all over the court, he still manages to fend off all attacks and finish with a backhand winner to set up a break point. Not much Lopez can do, and he tried everything.Djoker would race out to a 5-2 lead and now has set point, and the Serb wins the first frame when the Spaniard finds the net.Lopez would attempt to serve and volley in the second, but to no avail as Djokovic sets up another break point, as the Spaniard and his coach seem resigned to yet another loss against the top seed.On match point, Lopez will send his return long giving Novak the set 6-3, to maintain his rate of losing five games or less, and the defending champion is through to the Quarter-Finals. Djokovic cruises past Lopez 6-2, 6-3 \nFormer World Number 1 to play Wawrinka in next round That's big serving Canadian Milos Raonic in the near court against Rafael Nadal, and the Spaniard snaps off a winner down the line to set up a break point early in the first set.Nadal would break Raonic to build a 4-1 lead, and although the Canadian takes this point with a blistering forehand to the corner, Nadal wins the set 6-3.The second frame would be close and go to a tiebreak, but Nadal now has match point. He fires a forehand and Raonic tries to reply, but instead finds the net, so Rafa is moving on to face Stan Wawrinka in the Quarter-Finals. Frenchman to square off with Anderson in Quarter-Finals Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga facing Albert Ramos-Vinolas, who dispatched Roger Federer in the second round. The Spaniard keeps his momentum going, and takes the opening set 7-6. But he's unable to sustain that level as Tsonga battles back to win the second 7-5. Jo-Willy earns a critical break here in the decider with a monster backhand.The 16th seed would then win the third set 6-4, and next meets Kevin Anderson, who surprised Kei Nishikori in straight sets. Scotsman wins 6-7, 6-4, 6-4 to advance to Last Eight Andy Murray against American John Isner, whose mammoth serve win him the first set 7-6. But Murray breaks him here in the second, en route to winning the frame 6-4.The third seed plays smart in the decider, and the surprise backhand puts Isner on the ground.Murray holds strong, and secures the three-set win to remain unbeaten against the towering American.So here are the match-ups for the Last Eight. Djokovic will face Bernard Tomic, who beat Richard Gasquet in the third round. Murray's opponent is Tomas Berdych, who eliminated Gilles Simon in straight sets. Nadal squares off with Wawrinka, who defeated Marin Cilic... while Tsonga will hope to beat Anderson for a spot in the Final Four.
