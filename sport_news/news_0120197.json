The Cubs clinched the 2003 NLDS in Atlanta and had two chances to clinch the 2003 NLCS at Wrigley before something happened we're not allowed to discuss in Chicago.\nTheir only two previous clinchers occurred in the 1907 and 1908 World Series, both of which came in Detroit's Bennett Park before Wrigley was built.\nSchwarber's opposite-field line shot in the second, a mini-\"Schwarbomb\" that put the Cubs on the board, was the appetizer. It eased the pregame tension that occurs whenever the Cubs are playing a postseason game at home, a condition that has had no known cure since Game 6 of 2003.\nThe second was Castro's solo shot in the fourth, a no-doubt-about-it blast to left that tied the game at 2-2 and came right after the rhythmic clapping walk-up song ended. Castro watched it sail out to left and immediately went into a full-metal, Manny Ramirez-style showboating mode, bringing down the house.\n\"Best moment I've had in my career,\" Castro said.\nThe crowd was getting a little anxious by the time Bryant crunched one to left in the fifth with Soler on first for his first postseason homer, giving the Cubs a 4-2 lead. Bryant received a sunflower shower from his teammates in the dugout and came out for a curtain call, stealing a page from the Cardinals.\nBefore the collective sigh of relief over Bryant's blast ended, Rizzo cranked it to deep right field off left-handed reliever Kevin Siegrist. Rizzo gave it a look of deep and abiding admiration as Castro leaned back in the on-deck circle like a human apostrophe, and ran through a gauntlet of teammates like it was homecoming night at Mount Carmel.\n\"We know when the wind blows out here what we could do,\" Rizzo said. \"It's either smallest park in baseball or plays as the biggest park. We took advantage of it today. The weather here is unbelievable. No one could predict it'd be that nice.\"\nAfter the Cardinals had pulled to within one run in the top of the sixth, Soler took Adam Wainwright's first pitch out to left-center to give the Cubs breathing room again and give fans a chance to relax.\nThe Cubs dugout went berserk and Soler took the second curtain call.\n\"That's the reason why we go for the head,\" Schwarber said of the helmet-rubbing routine. \"It's all about 'we're in that at-bat with you in the dugout.' Whenever someone has success like that, we go nuts too.\"\nFowler's shot to right in the eighth proved to be the dessert.\n\"I think I was the only one without a hit at that point,\" Fowler said. \"I was praying I'd get a hit too.\"\nJake Arrieta wasn't at his best on Monday, but it didn't matter.\n\"It's going to happen,\" catcher Miguel Montero said. \"I'm actually happy it happened because I realize he's human. I was a little concerned about it.\"\nThe big guns picked Arrieta up, and now the Cubs can take the next big step on Tuesday.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs Anthony Rizzo Starlin Castro Jorge Soler St. Louis Cardinals", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c7d19/turbine/ct-cubs-sullivan-home-run-record-spt-1013-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:39:49.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
