Our relocation policy is very important.\"\nThe St. Louis Rams , Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers all have designs on moving to L.A., which has not had an NFL franchise since 1995, when the Rams and Raiders left.\nThe current timetable calls for submission of applications to relocate in January, when the owners could vote.\nThere has been speculation that timetable could be moved up to December, when the next owners meeting occurs in Dallas. But Pittsburgh Steelers president Art Rooney said he doesn't envision that.\nThe Rams are proposing a stadium in Inglewood, Calif., while the Raiders and Chargers have one planned for Carson.\nEarlier Wednesday, the owners approved more international games through 2025, including ones in places other than England, such as quite possibly Mexico, Germany and Canada.\nThe NFL will announce the 2016 international games this fall.\nGoodell reiterated that the league will continue to vigorously pursue in court reinstating Patriots quarterback Tom Brady 's four-game suspension for using underinflated footballs in the AFC championship game.\nBrady had the suspension set aside in federal court last month.\nIn the wake of the officiating mistake at the end of Detroit's loss to Seattle on Monday night, Goodell said rules for use of instant replay in officiating \"clearly will be discussed again\" by the powerful competition committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:33:03.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
