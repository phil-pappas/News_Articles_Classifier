By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — When Dayton Moore arrived in Kansas City, he saw that the evolution of the Kansas City Royals franchise in many ways hinged on the devolvement of Alex Gordon. \nGordon, who struggled mightily early in his career and played on several lousy teams, eventually turned into an All-Star, and he has been a big reason why the Royals are playing October baseball for the second year in a row. \nAnd Saturday at Kauffman Stadium, when his team needed him the most, Gordon came through in perhaps the biggest at-bat of his career. Gordon’s two-out double off Toronto ace David Price scored Mike Moustakas for the go-ahead run, and the Royals rallied for a 6-3 win in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series. \nGordon’s hit sent Price to the showers, his otherwise stellar line marred by a 30-pitch seventh inning in which he gave up five hits and five runs. Through six innings, the Royals mounted a rather feeble attack against Price. \nThe Toronto left-hander had stymied the Royals bats, not allowing a runner to cross home plate, and only giving up a first-pitch single to Alcides Escobar. But these are the Royals, and they have a tendency to rally. And that’s just what they did. \nTrailing 3-0 to start the bottom of the seventh, the Royals rally began with consecutive singles by Ben Zobrist ­— whose hit fell between two Blue Jays in position to catch it in shallow right field — Lorenzo Cain and Eric Homser. Kendrys Morales and Mike Moustakas each produced RBIs, setting up Gordon’s at-bat, which was followed by an RBI single from Alex Rios that sent the crowd of 40,357 into a frenzy. Those voices only got louder when the Royals tacked on an insurance run in the eighth. \nDanny Duffy (1-0) pitched a scoreless seventh before giving way to Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis. Yordano Ventura started for the Royals, giving up three runs in 5 1/3 innings while giving up eight hits and striking out six to go with two walks. \nOn the road to the ALCS, the Royals had to overcome the loss of Gordon as he missed about two months with a severe groin strain. Since his return from the disabled list, Gordon has struggled at times offensively but has had some big moments. In Game 1 of the ALCS, he hit a key double and scored a run. He also hit a home run in Game 3 of the AL Division Series and drove in the go-ahead run in Game 4 before adding a key double and scoring a run in Game 5. \n“It’s always tough to miss time during the year, when you’re not able to swing or see a lot of pitching, to come back and just get right back into it,” Gordon said. “I felt like I did a pretty good job of staying in shape, staying game ready. I had my struggles a little bit when I came back. \n“But overall, right now I feel pretty good and feel comfortable at the plate, and I’m seeing the ball good. I’ve been here for about a month and a half since the injury. I finally started to feel like I’m back in the groove.” \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:54:00.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
