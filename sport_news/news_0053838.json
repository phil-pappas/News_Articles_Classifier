Or was it the fact that the Raider Diaspora turned Qualcomm Stadium into O.Co Coliseum South, with at least an equal number of the fans and the vast majority of the noise during a 37-29 victory?\nMake no mistake. Regardless of the final score, padded as it was by three fourth-quarter Chargers touchdowns, this was a tail whipping of the first order.\nIf this is an indication of the future business partnership between these ancient rivals, Dean Spanos had better keep an eye on his wallet.\nThe Raiders have already stolen the Chargers’ souls. Might as well take their lunch money, too.\nOakland (3-3) scored on its first seven possessions, and if three trips to the red zone hadn’t resulted in field goals rather than touchdowns, the margin would have been worse.\nThe Raiders pretty much did whatever they wanted offensively. Derek Carr threw for an efficient 289 yards. Rookie receiver Amari Cooper shook loose for 133 yards on five catches, including a short pass toward the end of the second quarter that Cooper turned into a 52-yard touchdown, making Chargers defenders look like the Washington Generals.\nAnd Raiders’ backs punished the Chargers (2-5) to the tune of 5.0 yards a carry.\nMeanwhile, Philip Rivers – who threw for a club-record 503 yards a week ago in Green Bay – had to pad his stats in the second half to get to 336. San Diego’s seven first half possessions: Interception, punt, field goal, interception, punt, punt, field goal.\nThe day started badly: Rivers was intercepted on the third play of the game, with Malcolm Smith returning it to the San Diego 2-yard line to set up the Raiders first touchdown.\nOakland’s other pick, by D.J. Hayden, came on a pass Rivers threw behind Keenan Allen. Rivers was often off target while the game was in doubt, finishing 38 of 58 mainly by going 21 of 28 in the fourth quarter after the Chargers had fallen behind, 37-6.\n“There’s not much you can say after a game like this,” Chargers coach Mike McCoy said. “Nothing good happened from the first play on.”\nIf McCoy had little to say about his team’s uninspired, ineffective performance, he had nothing concrete to say about what could only have been a benching of first-round draft pick Melvin Gordon. He didn’t use the running back at all until the second series of the third quarter, opting for Branden Oliver.\nWas it a further way of reprimanding Gordon for his fumbling problems, perhaps?\n“We’re trying to win football games, not trying to punish people,” McCoy snapped. “We went with the game plan. We said from day one we were going to play (the running backs) by committee.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:28:44.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
