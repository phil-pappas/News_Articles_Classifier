We have to make sure it's done right. I think a lot will be determined in the next few months.\"\nUSA TODAY\nBell: Nothing hurts NFL more than 'integrity of game' being questioned\nThree teams are considering a move to Los Angeles: the St. Louis Rams, the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers.\n\"I think there needs to be a lot discussion with all three ownership groups, but again, I think we need to come to a consensus for what's best for the National Football League,\" Irsay said.\nBy 2 p.m. ET, several owners, such as Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots and Mark Davis of the Raiders started to trickle in to the league's headquarters for Tuesday's committee meetings.\nIrsay said \"it's always possible\" that the league could table discussion about an imminent move until the next significant round of owners meetings in December, but stressed the need to find a solution with temporary playing facilities while the city builds a stadium.\nUSA TODAY\nJust how badly are NFL kickers struggling in 2015?\nIrsay also added that he has spoken to Jaguars owner Shad Khan about the London market and the potential of \"eventually sending a team\" there, though Irsay stressed that Khan is \"still committed and trying to make it work\" in Jacksonville.\nThe final vote on the decision to bring one or two teams to Los Angeles should come closer to the Super Bowl, unless the NFL decides to accelerate that timeline.\n\"Well I think looking at the past history of the market it's no slam dunk to assume that two teams could go in there and be viable,\" Irsay said. \"I think that there really needs to be some excitement and that needs to be brought on by a stadium solution. Obviously success on the field brings that as well.\n\"But I really think the excitement of coming back and having a new stadium — and the potential that the new stadium area could be kind of like an NFL Disneyland. I think the traction in that is really exciting. I think that two teams can go out there, but those teams really have to win and market and do it right to have success.\"\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes .\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Inside Slant: Controversial call mars Seahawks win | 01:16 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero breaks down the Seahawks controversial Monday night victory over the Lions.
