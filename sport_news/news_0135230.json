Washington State head coach Mike Leach ranked 38th among FBS head coaches, with a salary of $2,750,000. \nThat figure is the same as Leach's salary in 2014. A year ago that ranked him 31st in the nation. None of that money came from performance or academic based incentives - which, like this year, could amount to a max bonus of $625,000. \nNow in his fourth season in Pullman, Leach is the sixth highest paid coach in the Pac-12. Washington's Chris Petersen is at the top of the list at $3,402,940. UCLA's Jim Mora is scheduled to take in $3,350,000, followed by Arizona's Rich Rodriguez ($3,238,844), Oregon's Mark Helfrich ($3,150,000), and Arizona State's Todd Graham ($3,002,960).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:22:44.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
