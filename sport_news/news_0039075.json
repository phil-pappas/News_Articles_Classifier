The Peruvians lost both of their first games. \nSquad: \nGoalkeepers: Jefferson (Botafogo), Alisson (Internacional), Cassio (Corinthians) \nDefenders: Danilo (Real Madrid), Daniel Alves (Barcelona), Filipe Luis (Atletico Madrid), Marcelo (Real Madrid), David Luiz (Paris Saint-Germain), Miranda (Inter Milan), Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain), Gil (Corinthians). \nMidfielders: Luiz Gustavo (Wolfsburg), Fernandinho (Manchester City), Elias (Corinthians), Renato Augusto (Corinthians), Oscar (Chelsea), Lucas Lima (Santos), Willian (Chelsea), Kaka (Orlando City). \nForwards: Douglas Costa (Bayern Munich), Neymar (Barcelona), Hulk (Zenit), Ricardo Oliveira (Santos). \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:27:32.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
