Chris Perkins Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Nine of 11 starters on Dolphins' offense were drafted by the team \nNine of the Dolphins' 11 offensive starters are homegrown talents, players drafted and developed by the front office and coaching staff. Only left tackle Branden Albert and tight end Jordan Cameron were selected by another team. \nSo when wide receiver Rishard Matthews, a seventh-round pick in 2012, took a huge hit last Sunday against Tennessee and bounced back up it could have been a metaphor for the Dolphins' recent offensive draftees. \nWhen the Dolphins (2-3) take the field Sunday against Houston (2-4) with their re-energized offense it'll be a direct reflection of years of hard work by the organization. \nWith center Mike Pouncey (first round, 2011), left guard Dallas Thomas (third round, 2013), right guard Billy Turner (third round, 2013), right tackle Ja'Wuan James (first round, 2014), tight end Dion Sims (fourth round, 2013), quarterback Ryan Tannehill (first round, 2012), running back Lamar Miller (fourth round, 2012), wide receiver Jarvis Landry (second round, 2014), and Matthews, the Dolphins are putting their \"draft and develop\" philosophy to work. \n\"It makes a difference,\" Dolphins interim coach Dan Campbell said. \"Here's the thing, when you draft your guys then you know you're probably going to keep them around for a while because you've invested money in them.\" Caption Full Episode: Have Dolphins transformed from finesse to physical team? \nX's and Omar: Sun-Sentinel's Omar Kelly and CBS 12's Matt Lincoln discuss the Dolphins situation as they prepare for the Texans. \nX's and Omar: Sun-Sentinel's Omar Kelly and CBS 12's Matt Lincoln discuss the Dolphins situation as they prepare for the Texans.

Dan Campbell strikes again \nChris Perkins and Omar Kelly discuss the latest motivational ploy by Dolphins interim coach Dan Campbell as well as Thursday's other practice news. \nChris Perkins and Omar Kelly discuss the latest motivational ploy by Dolphins interim coach Dan Campbell as well as Thursday's other practice news. See more videos \nThe rushing offense is 26th (91.4 yards per game) in the league, the passing offense is 16th (247 yards per game), and the scoring offense is 24th (20.6 points per game). \nOnly Pouncey has made a Pro Bowl among Miami's group of drafted offensive starters. But a large number of them are playing key roles. \nAnd when you throw in tight end Charles Clay (sixth round, 2011), who is now in Buffalo, the Dolphins' recent offensive draft picks earn another measure of respect. \n\"I think we're all doing a good job at staying relevant,\" said Matthews, who leads the Dolphins in receiving yards (363) and touchdowns (three) and is second in receptions (23). \nNot all of the Dolphins recent draft picks on offense have worked out.Players such as running back Daniel Thomas (second round, 2011), tight end Michael Egnew (third round, 2012) and tackle Jonathan Martin (second round, 2012) are no longer with the team. \nBut others such as Pouncey, Tannehill, Landry and James started as rookies. \nMiller, Thomas, Turner, Sims and Matthews developed later in their careers. \nWhile struggling at times, and not being full of star players, this crew has developed enough to form the core of a group that could be together for a while. \n\"I think the longer you're together,\" offensive coordinator Bill Lazor said, \"the more chances you have to have success.\" \nThe Dolphins still have other offensive draftees in the wings, most notably wide receiver DeVante Parker, this year's first-round pick. Campbell called Parker a \"flash player,\" meaning he flashes signs of promise. \n\"As soon as those flashes start showing up a lot more often,\" Campbell said, \"that's when you feel good about getting him on the field.\" \nMatthews, by the way, was running a slant pattern when he absorbed that big hit against the Titans. But he got up, and then enthusiastically signaled \"first down.\" \nJust as it happened with the Dolphins' recent offensive draftees, the payoff came after the initial hit. \n\"I was able to swag on him after,\" Matthews said with a smile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:20:14.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
