Tobias/The Advocate) \nNEWARK - Junior Chase Richardson and sophomore Christian Black have held down the fort at linebacker this season and have been playmakers for an improving Newark defense. \nCoach Mike Kopachy singled out Richardson as a guy other Newark players should try to emulate. \n“Chase Richardson plays his heart out every night,” Kopachy said. “I think he has led our team in tackles every week. If we could create a mold of him to get our kids to believe and fight, that would be a good model to go after because he gives his all every week. \n“He is kind of an unheralded guy and he probably has over 100 tackles.” \nRichardson is playing much bigger than his listed height (5-foot-9) and weight (190). \n“I just play for this team,” said Richardson, who typically can be found around the ball on defense. “I think about all of the time the coaches put in. We became close at the beginning of the year. We maybe didn’t come out and get those wins. But I just come out and play for my teammates and my seniors. \n“It’s all about getting that first win. That would give us so much confidence going into the last game or into next season.” \nRichardson is especially valuable on making first hits on ball carriers within the tackle box. \n“On big plays and big downs, I want the ball ran at me,” he said. “I want to see who is better than me. I want to prove to myself I can make those plays.” \nWith two games left, Richardson is hoping Newark can engineer a late-season breakthrough. \n“We’re putting it together, but big plays are killing us,” Richardson said. “It’s the same thing as last year. We will have a couple of good series and then a big play will hurt us.” \nAt 6-0 and 210 pounds, Black has the size and speed to develop into a real force for the Wildcats over the next two seasons. \n“It’s fast,” Black said. “It’s very fast. I feel like every week I am getting better and better at coming downhill and filling my holes and forcing guys to bounce it back or bounce it outside.” \nBlack said despite the losses, the coaches have tried to maintain a positive outlook as Newark builds toward better days. \n“The coaches have emphasized that we are very young and we are getting a chance to see varsity time and learn the speed of the game,” he said. “After the division change, we should look pretty good.” \nAsked about some other playmakers on the defense, Black said, “I look at Levi McKee and Ashton Gilkey. They do well on both sides of the ball. D’ante Woods runs the ball hard and comes over and helps us on defense every once in a while.” \nKopachy said Black has overcome some injuries this season. \n“He has been banged up, but he has played pretty well the last couple of weeks,” Kopachy said. “Those two are stepping up and will be anchors for our defense, not only this year but next year as well.” \nAug. 28: @Zanesville 20, Newark 17 \nSept. 4: Mount Vernon 48, Newark 22 \nSept. 11: @Heights 48, Newark 26 \nSept. 18: Pick.
