RB Alfred Blue (57 carries, 226 yards, 4.0 yards per carry) had a 139-yard performance against Tampa Bay. But the Dolphins, who allowed just 63 yards rushing to Tennessee last week, think they might have found their run defense. DT Ndamukong Suh had a good showing last week as did LBs Koa Misi and Jelani Jenkins. Still, it takes more than one good showing to be convinced about this unit. The Dolphins are 31st in run defense (141 yards per game) while Houston is 23rd in rushing offense (96 yards per game).
