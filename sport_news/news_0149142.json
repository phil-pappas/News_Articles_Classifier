The Eagles are one of the largest underdogs in Tiger Stadium history as LSU is favored by 45 points. \nLSU coach Les Miles has not come out and said that the game will resemble a scrimmage. But Eastern Michigan has the nation's worst defense against the run with 373 yards allowed a game, while LSU has one of the best running games in the nation as tailback Leonard Fournette is first in the country in rushing yards per game with 210 and third in overall rushing yards with 631. \n\"First and foremost, the important piece is to play well against Eastern Michigan,\" Miles said at the opening of his weekly press conference on Monday. \"Offensively, they really have moved the football against everybody they've played. They're going to come in here and play hard.\" \nEastern Michigan is 53rd in the nation in total offense with 435 yards a game and tied for 50th in scoring with 33.8 points a game. Tailback Darius Jackson is 26th in the nation in rushing with 407 yards, having carried 59 times with seven touchdowns. \nMiles did not mention Eastern Michigan's defense other than saying it has \"size and speed and makes plays.\" The plays the defense has made, though, are usually after a lot of yards have been gained. \n\"We'll have every intention of going in there and being our best,\" said Eastern Michigan coach Chris Creighton, whose first Eagles team went 2-10 last year with 65-0 and 73-14 losses to Florida and Michigan State, respectively. \"You've got to be sharp, and so it starts with us.\" \nLSU was a 24-point favorite last week at Syracuse and only won by 34-24 as it was guilty of 14 penalties for 120 yards. \n\"The score could've been way worse than it was without the penalties. We have to fix that,\" LSU defensive end Lewis Neal said. \n\"We need to have zero penalties in this game,\" LSU center Ethan Pocic said. \"That's what we're working toward. This game is about making our team better. We have a lot of things to work on.\" \nMiles went over LSU's penalty issues numerous times this week, which likely got his team's attention more than Eastern Michigan's accomplishments this season and recently. The Eagles last had a winning season in 1995 and went 2-10 in 2012, 2013 and 2014. \n\"Just because it's Eastern Michigan doesn't mean we change anything,\" LSU defensive tackle Davon Godchaux said. \"We do the same things we've been doing – study film, great practices and don't change nothing up. Of course, we've got to eliminate some of the penalties.\" \nMiles has not had much trouble with opponents like Eastern Michigan. Since becoming LSU's coach in 2005, he is 40-0 against non-conference opponents in the regular season, and his team was favored in all 40 of those games. He has won those games by an average margin of victory of 36 points, but he doesn't like talking about such lopsided affairs or the likelihood of same in Saturday's game. He bristled at a question this week about the opportunity to play a lot of younger non-starters. \n\"Everyone takes winning for granted except the guys in this room,\" he said of his players. \"It's about our goal and our path and what we have to and want to accomplish as a team.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wwltv.com/1RkTJs2 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:11:37.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
