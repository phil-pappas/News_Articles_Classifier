Instead, Tucker's plant foot sunk in to the turf as something like a miniature sinkhole opened up, causing Tucker to slip and fall while his kick went careening off the uprights.\nThe turf at the 49ers Levi's Stadium has long been criticized, and despite re-sodding the thing multiple times since the stadium opened just one season ago, it clearly hasn't gotten any better. Pretty soon, the stadium is going to look like what Heinz Field did in \"The Dark Knight Rises.\"\n[Via Joe Goodberry ]", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/e96WvjLEBiO", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DpRHniIMlew/maxresdefault.jpg", "https://vine.co/v/e9rUYl77rOu/embed/simple", "https://vine.co/v/e9rUYl77rOu", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:28:02.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
