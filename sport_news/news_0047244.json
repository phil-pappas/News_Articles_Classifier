That’s why it will be hard for any team, including the Washington Nationals , to evaluate him accurately as a potential manager. The job of grasping all of Ripken, not just what’s on the surface, will be difficult. But the Nats should make that effort. If Ripken turns out to be a fine manager, then passing on him, when he’s under your nose, would be an incredible waste of possibility. \nSometimes in sports, and perhaps in life, we make decisions because, at a gut level, we feel: This is a risk, but I just have to find out. Tom Boswell is a Washington Post sports columnist. View Archive \nIs Ripken, as a manager — a job in which he definitely could fail — one of those times when opportunity and fate unite for the Nationals? \nCal is almost always what he appears, but he usually more, too, with an unexpected component. \nLong ago, he was in a team brawl. He hurt his knee and didn’t think he’d be able to play in what would be his 1,793th straight game. His wife, Kelly, suggested he play an inning, or pinch-hit. “I wouldn’t do that,” he said. But what about the streak, she responded, “I thought that’s what you wanted.” 1 of 43 The Nationals’ rollercoaster 2015 season View Photos From high expectations in the spring to Jonathan Papelbon choking Bryce Harper in the dugout in the penultimate home game to Max Scherzer’s second no-hitter, Washington’s season was certainly memorable. Caption From high expectations in the spring to Jonathan Papelbon choking Bryce Harper in the dugout in the penultimate home game to Max Scherzer’s second no-hitter, Washington’s season was certainly memorable. Nationals infielder Yunel Escobar is greeted by teammates at the plate after hitting a walk-off home run in the 10th inning against the St. Louis Cardinals at Nationals Park on April 21, The Nationals won, 2-1. Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue. \n“You, too?” said Ripken. \nUnderestimating or misevaluating Ripken, as an athlete or for the past 14 years as a successful businessman, has been a thread throughout his life. The Orioles drafted him just two picks behind Larry Sheets and two ahead of Cecil Whitehead. He never would have moved from third base to shortstop, unless Earl Weaver, unlike everyone else, believed a 6-foot-4 220-pound man could play the spot. As potential rookie manager of a pennant contender in Washington, Ripken draws similar natural skepticism. \nThe issues cited against him are all factual and fair. He has no managerial experience at all. As a player, Ripken was a leader by example, but seldom considered charismatic as a teammate. He helped others, but focused on himself. Over his 21 seasons, the Orioles lost a few more games than they won. He never had the “winner” mantle of a Derek Jeter or (gulp) eventual manager Pete Rose. \nMost pertinent, Ripken has had no day-to-day exposure to MLB at the field level since 2001. That’s longer than Joe Gibbs was away from the NFL. Ripken seems knowledgeable during his postseason appearances as an analyst on TBS, including this week. But he also defers to Ron Darling, an everyday Mets broadcaster who knows current players in more detail. Also, baseball’s rule of thumb is that great players make mundane managers. Can they “relate?” \nAgainst those arguments, and others, we have Ripken’s own evaluation: He thinks he’s ready. Don’t underestimate the serious self-analysis behind that or the determination with which he would carry it out. \nAfter his rookie year, I asked him what his goal was. He said, “I’d like to play every game, every day for 20 years. Like Brooks Robinson and Pete Rose.” Taking him at his word has often been wise. \nMany of Ripken’s core traits are useful to managing, but maybe not sufficient without complementary gifts. Few are as shrewd at reading people. He likely would have a feel for the clubhouse. He might be good at identifying motivational buttons. But is that the same as empathy for a rookie or struggling vet? Does he have communication skill — a productive private meeting, the right word or emotional connection? One year after winning 96 games, a division title and National League Manager of the Year, Williams was fired with a year remaining on his contract. This time around, the Nationals should look at experienced candidates, says The Post's Adam Kilgore. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) \nCal’s father connected profoundly with players as a minor league manager where he was adored by future stars such as Jim Palmer and Eddie Murray. But at the big-league level, that didn’t translate. Other Ripken managers, such as Weaver and Robinson, thought “communication” meant that the phone to the bullpen was in working order. Of his best managers, only Davey Johnson had the interpersonal knack. \nWould Ripken have personal as well as baseball relationships with players, and thus inspire more loyalty? Ripken was keenly aware of Weaver’s blunt, even insensitive, touch with players. \nIs observation of bad managing also an education? Ripken played for manages so lame that teammates asked him to call pitches from shortstop. The manager didn’t know. Leadership or mutiny? \nPerhaps most misjudged is how well Ripken understands the psychologically crushing nature of a game he often made look like a joy. Everything about hitting came hard to Ripken, the man of 1,000 stances. \n“Someday Cal will have the worst swing in the Hall of Fame,” manager Gene Mauch once said. \nRipken understands the misery of acquiring mastery. But he will also grasp the value of players with unique gifts. Current advanced statistics rank Ripken as the fourth-most valuable defensive player in MLB history. His soft hands led to a three-error season or his toughness allowed him to make hundreds of double plays that others dodged. \nFew would be more in tune with current trends in valuing defense. As for shifts, Ripken created his own. Hitters just didn’t know it. He broke in anticipation of pitches, so by the time the ball got to the plate, he wasn’t where the hitter last saw him. How can a “slow” player be everywhere? That’s part of it. \nIf you love baseball, you will seldom get a knottier problem, or one with higher stakes, than Ripken, 55, getting a chance to manage in a sport where some managers last until 70. \nIn many ways, he was born, raised, almost bred to manage by everyone, starting with his father. Could he tolerate constant second-guessing? Well, he ignored “break the streak” critics for 10 years, won MVP in ’91 long after many had said The Streak was killing his game. And at 38, he hit .340. \nBut Ripken also has a solitary streak, a need for privacy. Out of 25 players, how many would he connect with, five or 20? You never know with a first-time manager. \nWhat’s the worst case? You hire Ripken and, for a couple of years, he resembles another shaved-headed home-run-hitting Gold Glove stoic: Matt Williams . But other fears are legitimate. Poor chemistry between Ripken and also-stubborn General Manager Mike Rizzo could have longer-term repercussions. That’s the key relationship to analyze. \nWhat’s the best case? Ripken is the manager of outstanding teams in Washington — as a bonus at a time when the Nats and Orioles are brawling in court over mega-millions in cable-TV money. That’s fannies in seats, eyeballs on TVs and even an image remake for a Washington team now seen as just a little too full of Natitude. Ripken does modesty and kick-your-rear (simultaneously) as well as anyone. \nWill the Nationals take a risk on a retread manager with experience, but not proven excellence, such as Bud Black or Rod Gardenhire? Or will they pick a manger with promise but no big-league track record? \nOr will they take a chance on the candidate who, though worrisome, also offers the biggest potential rewards: Ripken? The disguised element is Cal himself, despite all his fame. He always has proved smarter, more adaptable and shrewd than expected. His unanticipated upsides have been his secret to success all his life. \nThe choice is just as hard as it looks. And just as important, too. sports Success! Check your inbox for details.
