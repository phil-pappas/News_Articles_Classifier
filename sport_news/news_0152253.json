So, it was only natural that Massaro would ask Williams, his Vanderbilt counterpart, about the Commodores one day coming here to play the Blue Raiders at Floyd Stadium. \n“We had played Middle here in our place,” Williams said, “and Chris talked about wanting to have us come up to their place. That made sense. We’ve had them down here, and they wanted us to be there.” \nConversations between the two over several years also included then-Vanderbilt coach Bobby Johnson and Blue Raiders skipper Rick Stockstill, who arrived at MTSU in 2006. Ultimately, the jigsaw puzzle of non-conference scheduling fell into place. \nIn March of 2008, the four-game series was announced. It would start this year with Vanderbilt visiting MTSU for the first time since 1920 and then returning two years later. MTSU travels to Vanderbilt in 2016 and ’18. \n“It has been on the books a long time,” Massaro said of the series that kicks off Saturday at 6 p.m. with a national television audience watching on the CBS Sports Network. “It’s one of those when you sign the contract, you hope you are here for it. You’re wondering if you’re not going to be, and the same way with coach ‘Stock’ when we were talking about it.” \nKudos to Williams for scheduling this series, plus also adding a home-and-home set with WKU that started this season with a Vanderbilt home loss. The Commodores have also scheduled home games against FCS neighbors Austin Peay this season and Tennessee State in 2016 and ’18. \n“I do think it is good to play schools in the community,” Williams said. “It obviously helps them to have an SEC school come into their stadium. While we want to beat them, we want to help them develop their program. I think it is something that (Massaro and I) both thought was something good to do.” \nAs a member of the Power Five Southeastern Conference, Vanderbilt appears to have little to gain and more to lose when playing Conference USA and FBS members MTSU and WKU, especially on the road. Vanderbilt is a slight underdog in Saturday’s game at MTSU, as it was at home to WKU in the season opener. \nBut the Vandy AD doesn’t necessarily agree. \n“People talk like that,” Williams said. “We are supposed to win every game. And they think they are supposed to win every game. I think that sort of the location of where you play is really secondary to it. \n“Some people will say, ‘Well, because you are this, you should have a favorite, and you should win.’ But I’m sure they’re not backing down because we’re SEC.” \nMassaro agreed that Vanderbilt scheduling the four-game series benefits MTSU and Vanderbilt in particular and college football in the area in general. With its 2009 visit, Mississippi State is the only other SEC team to play the Blue Raiders at Floyd Stadium. \n“I commend Vanderbilt for doing the four-game series,” Massaro said, “because I think it is good for college football in our area and in our city. It creates local interest all the way from the local high schools to the local media. \n“There’s nothing wrong with being on the front of the newspaper and in a discussion line and all those kind of things. I think it helps Vanderbilt. I know it helps us, so it’s a really good series.” \nGreg Pogue is host of The Greg Pogue & Big Joe Show on WNSR 560 AM.
