SEATTLE -- The Seattle Mariners hired former big league catcher Scott Servais as their manager Friday, giving the job to someone with ties to the new front office but no experience running a team. The 48-year-old Servais replaces Lloyd McClendon, who was fired earlier this month after Seattle went 76-86. Servais will be formally introduced by the team next week. New Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto made the announcement. Servais has worked the past five seasons as an assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Angels and worked alongside Dipoto for most of that time. Dipoto resigned as Angels GM on July 1. Not only did Dipoto and Servais work together with the Angels, they were teammates for one seasons in Colorado in 2000. Servais oversaw the Angels' scouting and player development, and had wanted to be on a major league coaching staff. He joined Dipoto and the Angels in 2011 after spending six seasons as the senior director of player development with Texas. Servais was credited with the growth of slugger Nelson Cruz during the time together with the Rangers - Cruz now plays for Seattle. Servais spent time with Houston, the Cubs and San Francisco during his playing career. He hit .245 with 63 home runs and 319 RBIs in 820 career games. Servais served as a catching instructor for the Cubs for two seasons after retiring and was a scout in Colorado before joining the Rangers front office in 2005. Servais grew up in Coon Valley, Wisconsin. After starring at Westby High School, Servais went to Creighton University and played on the gold-medal winning 1988 Olympic baseball team. News 8 caught up with Servais' dad, Daniel, who confirmed Scott called him Friday morning to say he got the job. \"He sounded very excited. It's something he's always been looking forward to and it was one of his dreams that he was hoping he could do some day, and now he's got the opportunity.\"\"Very proud of him. He's worked very hard, he's been in baseball his whole life ever since he left college.\" At a young age dad believed Scott was destined to be a big league manager. \"I did at one time because when he was very young, I think it was one of his goals to be a manager. And I think after he got done, he retired from pro ball and got into the other side of the business, the business side of it with finding players and stuff like that, he still missed putting on his uniform. And now he gets to put on the uniform and go out and coach these guys.\"\"Like Scott says, one thing about a manager, he says, 'After you get hired, it's just a matter of time before you get fired.' (laughs) And I hope it doesn't happen for a long, long time, but managers always get fired. (laughs)\" The hiring makes Servais the 10th full-time and interim manager for the Mariners since the club's last playoff appearance in 2001. \nCopyright 2015 by WKBT News8000 .
