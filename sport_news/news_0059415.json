Tailback Christian McCaffrey caught a pitch from his quarterback and ran to the right. McCaffrey’s lead blocker laid out Arizona defensive back Cam Denson, knocking him to the ground. Stanford gained 25 yards on the play and, soon after, took a 20-7 lead.\nThe blocker was Keller Chryst, Stanford’s 6-foot-5, 228-pound freshman backup quarterback.\n“If that happened to me,” said Cardinal linebacker Blake Martinez, “I’d leave the stadium and never come back.”\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats XTRA app: Get latest news, scores\nThere’s been a lot of that lately for UA, a team in the midst of a two-game losing streak. Two weeks ago, Arizona lost 56-30 to UCLA and allowed 497 yards; last week against Stanford, the Wildcats lost 55-17 and allowed 570 yards.\n“We have to play better,” UA coach Rich Rodriguez said. “We haven’t played well in a couple weeks.”\nSomething is wrong with Arizona’s defense, and Rodriguez insists it's not schematic. He’s been running a 3-3-5 “odd stack” defense since his days at West Virginia.\nSo, what is it then?\nThe injuries? The talent? The opponent?\nA few answers:\nInjuries and depth\nRodriguez knew the second he saw Arizona’s 2015 schedule that the Wildcats would have to stay healthy to complete.\nThat didn’t happen.\nAll-American linebacker Scooby Wright tore his meniscus early in UA’s season-opening win against UTSA and missed two games. Wright returned only to sprain his foot, putting his season in jeopardy.\nAZCENTRAL\nUA football coach Rich Rodriguez defends defensive scheme\nDerrick Turitui, a 6-1, 265-pound outside linebacker and Arizona’s second-best pass rusher after Wright, has battled groin and hip injuries and will miss Saturday’s game against Oregon State.\n“That’s like losing four guys instead of just two,” Rodriguez said.\nLinebacker Cody Ippolito, Wright’s backup, tore his ACL in training camp and won’t play this season. Linebackers Haden Gregory (knee) and DeAndre’ Miller (wrist) have missed five combined games; defensive end Luca Bruno (concussion) missed one game.\nThe depth issue stems from recruiting misses, too — of the 40 defensive signees from Rodriguez’s first three Arizona recruiting classes who could’ve still had eligibility this season, 17 are no longer with the program.\nAZCENTRAL\nUA football looks to get back to winning ways\nMissed tackles\nArizona is the only team in the Pac-12 without a linebacker listed among its top three tacklers. Safety Will Parks leads the way with 36, good for 14th in the conference.\nJake Matthews has 20 tackles, most among UA linebackers; he’s a former walk-on who wasn’t even a starter to begin the season.\nTackling has been an issue the last two weeks.\nStanford rushed for 314 yards and four touchdowns against Arizona; UCLA had 213 and six scores. Individually, Paul Perkins (85 yards, three touchdowns) and Christian McCaffrey (156 yards, one touchdown) were a handful for Arizona’s defense. They’re both certainly skilled — Perkins and McCaffrey rank third and fourth, respectively, in the Pac-12 in rushing — but Arizona’s tackling mishaps didn’t help.\nIn those two games combined, the Wildcats — and this is an unofficial stat — have 48 missed tackles.\nAZCENTRAL\nPac-12 football power rankings - Week 6\nBroken down by position, the defensive backs (25) had the most, followed by the linebackers (16) and defensive line (16).\nWright, clearly not himself in his first game back, missed six against the Bruins. His replacement in the middle against Stanford, senior Sir Thomas Jackson, missed five. The biggest culprits in the secondary the last two games: safety Jamar Allah and corner DaVonte’ Neal, each with six.\n“There’s fundamental things that all of our guys could probably do a little bit better,” Rodriguez said, “like pursuit angles and some other fundamental stuff.”\nThere needs to be “better communication,” safety Tellas Jones added. “Every week and every practice, we’ve been trying to get better at that.”\nBig plays\nIn the last two weeks, Arizona has allowed 23 plays of 15 or more yards and seven plays of 30 or more yards.\nStanford quarterback Kevin Hogan completed three consecutive passes of 15, 18 and 18 yards, the last one a touchdown to Michael Rector.\n“There’s always more than one reason that big plays happen on either side,” Rodriguez said.\nHogan only had two incompletions on 19 pass attempts. UCLA’s Josh Rosen, a true freshman, started 14 of 17 against UA.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona football has real tough time against No. 18 Stanford\nThe red zone\nThis will be short and (not-so) sweet.\nArizona’s opponents have converted on 95.8 percent of their possessions in the red zone. That’s 18 touchdowns and five field goals on 24 tries.\nIt ranks last in the Pac-12 and 122nd in the nation.\nBoth Stanford and UCLA were each 6 of 6 in the red zone with a touchdown on every possession inside the 20-yard line.\nForcing turnovers\nTra’Mayne Bondurant’s nickname was “Bang Bang” for a reason.\nIn 2014, the playmaking “spur” in Arizona’s defense forced forced five fumbles, recovered three and had two interceptions. Bondurant’s gone.\nWright forced five fumbles and recovered one. He also had 164 tackles, 31 for loss and 15 sacks. He’s out.\nAs a team, the Wildcats forced 26 turnovers last season.\nIn 2015, Arizona is on pace for just 14. Wright and Will Parks, Arizona’s playmaking answer to Bondurant’s departure, have yet to force a takeaway.\nParks, from Philadelphia, had two interceptions and one fumble recovery last year.\n“He’s one of the guys defensively that has the ability to make some game-changing plays,” Rodriguez said of Parks. “So we gotta figure out ways to get him involved.”\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona football blasted for second consecutive week as No. 18 Stanford rolls\nSize disadvantage in the trenches\nArizona’s defensive line has struggled to get off blocks the last two weeks.\nIt’s hard to blame them too much, though, considering their size disadvantage. UCLA’s five starting offensive linemen stand, on average, 6-5 and weigh 302 pounds, while Stanford’s average 6-5, 301.\n“They were physical,” defensive lineman Jeff Worthy said of Stanford.\nOn the opposite end, Arizona’s starting defensive linemen — Sani Fuimaono, Luca Bruno and Reggie Gilbert — stand an average of 6-3 and weigh an average of 271 pounds.\nAs a result, there’s been little-to-no pass rush: Arizona has two sacks in each of the last two weeks, but only one — in the first quarter against Stanford — came when the game wasn’t already a blowout.\n“The defensive staff is doing the best it can to put guys in position to make plays,” Rodriguez said. “We’re not gonna sit there and give up, we’re gonna try everything we can.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c47d660a401556d2cda0cdf550493e6d1fa9b13/c=87-0-612-525/local/-/media/2015/08/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635762183712997114-arizonawildcats.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d825dd0c9b924527b38fc8f808e87a0706bc8346/c=0-0-3803-3803/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635797678490481004-anu.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0946e352c5dc4458307f2a9958c9bd336eede46/c=1249-0-3756-2507/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635795111264290073-12.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5db28afa1df4f14f137c19d1d6702ff8b412625/c=706-0-3530-2824/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Phoenix/Phoenix/635795817233714300-richrod.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a0849d7894b9751cbb67bf89100b540e51ca72f/c=1040-0-3637-2597/local/-/media/2015/10/05/Phoenix/Phoenix/635796857204489374-defense.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce7d4d3462a06d142026d61f4fe0765a3f3078aa/c=438-0-2438-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635797535591712992-pac-12-collage.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:10:13.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
