What do you think? Be the first to comment \nAnd the £4,500 gained in prize money makes Jones pretty much a shoo-in for the World Championship, a notion which had looked in serious doubt. \nIt would be the first PDC worlds without Jones involved since 2003, but he could rubber-stamp his position after tomorrow and Sunday’s Players Championship at the same venue.
