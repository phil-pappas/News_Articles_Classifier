The Falcons notched their fourth win in five games on Friday with a 41-6 victory over Apalachee in Flowery Branch. \nThe win helped keep the Falcons (5-3, 4-3 Region 8- ) in contention for a playoff spot in Region 8- and showed off the Branch's defensive prowess. \nApalachee (0-7, 0-6) managed just 150 total yards on the night -- led by 89 yards rushing and a touchdown from Stephen Massillon. It was far from enough to derail the Falcons, however. \nKory Graham passed for two touchdowns on five completions, finishing with 105 yards through the air. His first score went for 66 yards to receiver Cortez Davis. Trey Wilcoxson also scored three touchdowns while rushing for 86 yards on 15 carries to help pace the Falcons. \nFlowery Branch took a 21-6 halftime advantage and then blew the game open with 20 unaswered points in the third quarter. \nThe Falcons will take a bye next week before looking to maintain their momentum on Oct. 30 against Salem. \nApalachee will look to bounce back next week against Heritage.
