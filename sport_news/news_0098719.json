But UMass coach Mark Whipple said Bowling Green was simply better in every facet of the game.\n“We didn’t make a play on defense to get any kind of momentum,” Whipple said. “We tried to do it on offense and really missed some things.”\nIt briefly appeared UMass had put itself in position to at least compete with the Falcons.\nTrailing 28-10 near the end of the first half, the Minutemen embarked on an 81-yard drive in 92 seconds that resulted in a 23-yard touchdown pass from Blake Frohnapfel to Tajae Sharpe to make it 28-17. UMass defensive back Kelton Brackett intercepted Bowling Green’s Matt Johnson on the ensuing drive, and the Minutemen received the kickoff to start the second half.\n“The game was within reach,” Frohnapfel said.\nBut UMass was stopped on fourth down on its first drive of the second half — Frohnapfel attempted a quick pass to Elgin Long which fell incomplete — and Bowling Green capitalized, scoring a touchdown eight plays later to go up 35-17.\n“You don’t want to get stopped there,” Frohnapfel said. “That’s a bad read on a situation like that.”\nRunning back Marquis Young fumbled on UMass’ first play from scrimmage following the score, and the Falcons responded with a 40-yard touchdown pass from Johnson to Ryan Burbrink.\nIn a span of 67 seconds, Bowling Green pushed the lead from 28-17 to 42-17.\nThe Minutemen did respond — freshman James Oliphant returned the ensuing kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown — but couldn’t stop the Falcons offense, which removed its starters by the fourth quarter. UMass forced only two punts all game.\nUMass placed an emphasis on execution, specifically in the red zone, in the week leading up to the contest, and Whipple said his team’s failure to do so was a critical factor in the loss.\nThe Minutemen (1-4, 0-1) entered the red zone on their first three drives, but came away with only 10 points. One such instance — a Frohnapfel interception in the end zone — led to a five-play, 78-yard Bowling Green scoring drive to make it 21-10.\nFrohnapfel said it was one he wanted back.\n“That interception in the end zone was pretty bad,” he said. “I made a throw I probably shouldn’t have made. . . . In a game like that we were down a couple touchdowns, you’re making those throws where you normally wouldn’t.”\nFrohnapfel was 34-of-56 for 409 yards and three touchdowns. Sharpe led the Minutemen with 156 receiving yards on 13 catches, including his TD.\nUMass now heads back to Amherst, where the pressure mounts as it prepares to face Kent State Saturday at McGuirk Stadium.\n“There’s definitely a big sense of urgency,” Mills said. “But the season’s not over, we still have a chance to compete and play for something.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:37:11.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
