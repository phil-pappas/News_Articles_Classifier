It's time @NUFC Over to you boys #Geordies #NUFC\" - former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer (@alanshearer) expressed his worst fears ahead of the game but they came true as Sunderland triumphed 3-0 for a sixth derby triumph in a row against the Magpies. \n? \nPLAYER RATINGS (Out of 10) \nCostel Pantilimon: 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:19:54.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
