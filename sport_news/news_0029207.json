Chengelis , The Detroit News 8:10 p.m. EDT October 13, 2015 Former Michigan head coach Brady Hoke (Photo: Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News) \normer Michigan coach Brady Hoke likes Michigan's chances in the upcoming rivalry game against Michigan State. \nHoke, who now has a twice-weekly gig on SiriusXM College Sports with host Mark Packer, discussed Saturday's game while responding to a caller during the show Tuesday afternoon. \nHoke spent the last four seasons coaching Michigan and was 1-3 against the Spartans, the lone win coming in 2012, 12-10, at Michigan Stadium, the last time the teams played there. He was fired after last season's 5-7 record and replaced by Jim Harbaugh. \nSeventh-ranked and unbeaten Michigan State plays No. 12 Michigan (5-1) on Saturday at Michigan Stadium. ESPN's College GameDay will be originating from there. The Spartans have won six of the last seven meetings with the Wolverines. \n\"Michigan State, they're coming in this game limping a little bit from an injury standpoint, but I did like in just evaluating how (quarterback) Connor Cook played last week (at Rutgers), he threw for 357 yards,\" Hoke said on SiriusXM. \"I think matching their receivers will be the first test for Michigan's defensive backs. \n\"Now, that (Michigan) pass rush and the way the front four is playing and the front seven, they're playing awfully hard. I think this is going to be a great game. I think Michigan is going to win the game, but I also think this is exactly what Mark Dantonio and Michigan State (like). They feed off everyone talking about Michigan, and that's just the way their makeup is.\" \nHoke said the team that doesn't turn the ball over and can run the ball will win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:20:27.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
