He will face 0-4 Randy Heddericks of Gulfport, Miss., in a four-round, welterweight match today at the Florida Orange Event Center on Combee Road in Lakeland. JAMES BENNETT/LEDGER CORRESPONDENT JAMES BENNETT/LEDGER CORRESPONDENT Published: Saturday, October 10, 2015 at 12:07 a.m. Last Modified: Saturday, October 10, 2015 at 12:07 a.m. \nLeAnthony “Tyga” Fleming has a word of advice to those who couldn't afford to see Floyd Mayweather's last fight. Facts \nWHAT: Bombs Away 4, presented by Mad Integrity Fight Sports. Eight bouts are scheduled.WHEN: Tonight starting at 7. Doors open at 6:30 p.m.WHERE: Florida Orange Event Center, Combee Road in Lakeland.ADMISSION: Regular admission is $30. VIP admission is $60 and includes free beer from Brew Hub for those 21 and older. \n“A lot of people are in a financial situation where they can't see Floyd fight. Cool, come see me fight because I'm the closest thing to him,” he said. \nAt 0-1, the former Sonrise Christian football standout has a long way to go to back up comparisons to the undefeated world champion, but today he hopes to take a step forward. In his second professional bout, Fleming will face 0-4 Randy Heddericks of Gulfport, Miss., in a four-round, welterweight match today at the Florida Orange Event Center on Combee Road in Lakeland. It's part of the undercard in an eight-bout presentation by Mad Integrity Fight Sports starting at 7 p.m. \n“I'm coming to put on a show and get him out of there early,” Fleming said. \nFleming had a dominating high school football career at Sonrise Christian after transferring from Bill Duncan Opportunity Center, an alternative school for students with behavioral issues. \n“I had a friend of mine playing at Sonrise and he came to me and said, 'Man you got too much talent to be wasting out here at Bill Duncan. You should come to Sonrise.' I said, 'How am I going to do that? They won't let me out of here.' He said, 'You go to a private school they have no choice but to let you go.' So I went to Sonrise and broke every record they had. And it went on from there.” \nFleming's performance with Sonrise Christian led to a year of junior college and a scholarship to Central Connecticut State University. But a loss of the scholarship and child-support obligations led Fleming to drop out of school. Depressed and desperate for an opportunity, he began flipping through the phone book, calling boxing gyms. \n“I used to fight a lot in the streets, so I was like, what about boxing?” he said. \nAfter connecting with a trainer, Fleming said he found his path. \n“I stepped foot in there and fell in love with it. I've been doing it ever since off and on. Now I'm back doing it full time. “ \nThat was 2008. Fleming's first professional bout was in 2014 in Tampa, against Armando Alvarez. He lost by decision and says that a poor fight camp, with no sparring or organization, was a key factor in his defeat. \n“First one didn't go my way,” he said. “I had some mishaps at the gym and I wasn't able to train like I was supposed to. Basically I was unprepared for the fight.” \nFleming has connected with trainer Marco Fazzini and strength-and-conditioning coach Terry Tari of Lakeland. He fights out of Winter Haven Boxing Gym. \n“This is his first real camp in boxing,” Fazzini said. “This is probably the hardest he's trained ever. He's starting to realize how important it is for his professional career to actually have good camps. We've been working on being extra sharp, working off the jab, landing good right hands, just being patient in the ring. I think Saturday will be good for him.” \n“Boxing is a whole different world,” Fleming said. “With football, you have 10 other players that can help you win or help you lose. Boxing is just you and the other guy so you can't blame nobody but yourself.” \nIn tonight's main event, light heavyweights Radivoje Kalajdzic (19-0, 12 knockouts) and Domingos (23-3, 21 KO) face off in an eight-round bout. \nArmando Alvarez, the undefeated fighter that defeated Fleming last year,faces Juan Aguirre in a junior welterweight six-round fight. \nThe other four-round undercard bouts feature Michael Guillen vs. Curtis Vert, Joseph White vs. Roger Streeter, Wytama Faulk vs. Clark Brightwell, Alexander Charneco vs. Leonardo Kenon, and Brian Meadows vs. Raynard Younger. \nDoors open at 6:30 p.m. Regular admission is $30. VIP admission is $60 and includes free beer from Brew Hub for those 21 and older. LeAnthony “Tyga” Fleming flexes during his weigh-in at Big Dog's Patio in Plant City Friday afternoon.
