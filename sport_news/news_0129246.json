Probably not, so here’s a really quick recap: Whitlock left the Star , was upset about some things that went on during his time there, and proceeded to rip the newspaper during a long-winded rant on live radio that included him shedding a few tears. It was a magical moment for Whitlock—and for everyone who spent a whole afternoon discussing it on Twitter.\nFast forward to 2015, and Whitlock is now promising #TheExplanation2, which, based on the fact that it’s in hashtag form, may or may not take place on Twitter. Whitlock and ESPN just parted ways a few months after Whitlock was removed as the Editor-in-Chief of ESPN’s yet-to-be-unveiled website The Undefeated . And as you'd expect, it doesn’t sound like he’s happy about it. Just check out a couple of the tweets he sent out this morning:\nDon't believe everything you read/hear about me. Always been transparent. The Explanation 2.0 is coming soon. #WeDontBuyCornersWeTakeCorners\n— Jason Whitlock (@WhitlockJason) October 6, 2015 Continuously employed since 1990. 8 employers. Fired by 1. The Explanation 2.0. Don't miss it. #BetterThanOriginal https://t.co/wq4muoJXLs\n— Jason Whitlock (@WhitlockJason) October 6, 2015 In addition to those tweets, which seem to indicate that Whitlock has a lot of things to get off his chest, he also addressed the recent Stephen A. Smith and Kevin Durant \"beef\" and called ESPN out for the way they handled it:\nESPN promotes SAS's rebuttal to Kevin Durant's criticism. Others advised to take high road, say nothing when attacked. #TheExplanation2\n— Jason Whitlock (@WhitlockJason) October 6, 2015 Threaten prominent, black athlete = promotable. Call powerful, white commissioner liar = fireable. The Explanation 2.0. DO NOT MISS IT.\n— Jason Whitlock (@WhitlockJason) October 6, 2015 And to finish things off, Whitlock referenced the Deadspin article that was published about him earlier this year and called out the writer of it:\nYeah, daddy's home. Streets about get cleaned up. #TheExplanation2\n— Jason Whitlock (@WhitlockJason) October 6, 2015 Tell Greg Howard that Craggs and Marchman ghostwriting his stuff and rewriting Ta Coates talking points won't save his ass #daddyshome\n— Jason Whitlock (@WhitlockJason) October 6, 2015 So when will #TheExplanation2 take place? Stay tuned! This is looking like it's going to get good.\n .\n[ via For The Win ]", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/more-sports/2015/10/04/jason-whitlock-espn-bought-out-fox-sports-1", "https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason/status/651412255410524160", "https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason/status/651408723890454528", "http://deadspin.com/how-jason-whitlock-is-poisoning-espns-black-grantland-1698683962?utm_expid=66866090-56.xSggy8zmSwG3vMsivr7rOg.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/daddyshome?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BetterThanOriginal?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason/status/651408201519226880", "https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason/status/651391931960832000", "https://t.co/wq4muoJXLs", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeDontBuyCornersWeTakeCorners?src=hash", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/jason-whitlock-goes-on-furious-rant-after-parting-ways-with-espn", "https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason/status/651396428695076865", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheExplanation2?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason/status/651407769640144896", "http://www.sbnation.com/2010/8/21/1634944/jason-whitlock-explanation-jay-mariotti-arrested-felony"], "published": "2015-10-06T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:34:00.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
