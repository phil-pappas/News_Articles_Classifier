The Blue Jays defeated the Rangers 6-3. Photo by Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images View all 16 photos In recent history, no MLB team has been more adept at coming up short in the postseason than the Texas Rangers . The summation of their struggles came to light in one unfortunate inning during Wednesday’s game against the Toronto Blue Jays ; as the team fell apart, falling in the series in the process.\nPhoto by Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images Seven was not the lucky number for the Rangers, although it started well. During the top half of the seventh inning, with the score tied 2-2, the tomfoolery officially got underway. After a pitch, Blue Jays catcher attempted to toss the baseball back to pitcher Aaron Sanchez. It instead deflected off of hitter Shin-Soo Choo’s bat, trickling down the third base line. An astute Rougned Odor was waiting at third. Smelling an opportunity with the live ball, he dashed home; putting the Rangers up 3-2.\nOriginally, he was ordered back to third, but, after a conversation between the officials, he was directed home, with the run counting. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons would protest, but his pleas would be in vain.\n\"First time I've ever been involved in a play like that in my life,” said Martin. “I wasn't really sure what the rule was. I think if he's in the box, there's nothing wrong. If he's outside the box, then he's out. He was inside the box.\n\"I heard the umpire [call it dead]. But then they got together and went over the rule, and I'm sure they got it right. You have like eight brains out there. You're going to get it right.''\nBlue Jays fans didn’t seem to think so, as they littered the field with garbage in protest. The uprising would eventually be quelled, but more shenanigans would unfold following the seventh inning stretch.\nRussell Martin would lead off the frame, hitting a ground ball to shortstop Elvis Andrus , who, perhaps looking to throw before securing the ball, would fall to come up with the routine grounder. Martin would take first. Andrus would be charged with an error.\nKevin Pillar would bat next, hitting a grounder to Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland. Looking like a routine double-play, it appeared that Andrus’ previous error would be erased. Alas, the baseball gods had other ideas. Andrus would prove unable to handle a shoddy throw from Moreland. Both runners would be safe. Moreland would be charged with an error.\nRyan Goins would step up to the plate next, laying down a bunt. Expecting the play, Adrian Beltre would grab the grounder and turn to fire to Andrus, who was covering third. Perhaps ‘all shook up” from the two previous plays, Elvis would again drop the ball. All three runners would be safe. Andrus would be charged with another error.\nThree plays, three errors and suddenly the Rangers were in a bases loaded jam. It marked the first time in postseason history that a team had three errors in one inning of a winner-take-all game. Andrus was at the center of all three.\n\"Nothing good is going through my mind right now,’ said Andrus after the game. “We had an opportunity to win and I let everybody down. I should have made the plays. They were easy plays. I should make them 100 times out of 100. There is no excuse. This is the toughest point of my career.\"\nThe Rangers would finally get an out on the next play with a force at home. That would mark the end of Cole Hamels’ night, as Sam Dyson would then come in to face Josh Donaldson, who would hit a routine popup to Odor, who would make a bad read on the ball and watch it bounce off the tip of his glove. So routine was the play that base runner Ben Revere headed back to first, and was then forced out at second. Pillar would score however, and the game would suddenly be tied; a monster of the Rangers’ own erroneous creation.\nThe game would not remain tied for long however, as Jose Bautista would launch the ball 442 feet with an epic home run. Just as epic as the homer was “Joey Bats’’ bat flip that followed, causing the Toronto crowd to erupt in jubilation.\nEdwin Encarnacion would try to temper the gathered masses, only to be confronted by a disgruntled Dyson. The benches would clear, but order would eventually be restored momentarily.\nTroy Tulowitzki would pop out in foul territory to end the inning, but Dyson would stir up some more trouble; walking up to “Tulo” and patting him on his posterior. The benches would clear yet again.\nIn all, the inning took 53 minutes, but it will haunt the memories of the Rangers for far longer. They would fall in the contest 6-3. Falling in the series 3-2. The Blue Jays are headed to the ALCS. The Rangers are headed home; having fallen victim to their own worst enemy: themselves.", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2015/story/_/page/playoffs15_seventhinningALDSGame5/inside-look-epic-seventh-inning-game-5-texas-rangers-toronto-blue-jays", "http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-rangers/headlines/20151014-grant-will-his-defensive-struggles-in-game-5-define-elvis-andrus-career.ece", "http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2015_10_14_texmlb_tormlb_1&mode=box#game=2015_10_14_texmlb_tormlb_1,game_tab=box"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:03:40.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
