(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nAnn Arbor — De'Veon Smith was asked shortly after No. 18 Michigan earned its third straight shutout, this time a 38-0 upset of No. 13 Northwestern, if he was already thinking about what's next on the schedule.\n\nMichigan, now 5-1, 2-0 Big Ten, faces in-state rival Michigan State on Saturday, the first time since 2012 the teams will play at Michigan Stadium. The Spartans have dominated the series of late winning six of the last seven meetings.\n\"Not really. We were really focused on Michigan S … I mean, Northwestern,\" Smith said, catching himself but still drawing laughter at the postgame news conference. \"They're a great team. We were really focusing on Northwestern.\n\"It was two minutes left on the clock out there and you start thinking about who we've got next and we were ready to go. We know what we have to do next week and how we have to prepare as a team.\"\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh called Michigan State a \"tremendous opponent.\" Early this year when Harbaugh and his staff were at a high school coaching function in Detroit, he referenced MSU as the \"biggest guy on the block.\"\nDETROIT NEWS\nRudock continues his mastery of Northwestern\n\"Going to demand we're at our very best,\" Harbaugh said of MSU. \"That's going to mean a great week of preparation. Move on even more quickly than usual (after the win) because it is such a good, worthy opponent next week. We'll be looking forward to it.\"\nSmith said it's been \"frustrating\" to lose to MSU, but this group will maintain the status quo as they begin preparations with film breakdown on Sunday.\n\"It's our rival team,\" Smith said. \"We're not going to change our methods on how we approach games. We're just going to approach this game like it's another one and do our best.\"\nThe Michigan players chose not to bite much when asked about the Spartans.\n\"They're a good team,\" Jabrill Peppers said. \"We're just trying to enjoy this win right now. When we come in tomorrow, we'll watch the film and start the game plan process.\"\nSaid Jourdan Lewis, who returned an interception for a touchdown in the win over Northwestern: \"I know they're a good team, a great team, actually.\"\nSmith said this team, which already has equaled the total number of wins last season, has a different outlook.\n\"There's something different about this team than there was last year even though we have basically the same players,\" Smith said. \"I don't know, there's something different about us. We're tired of losing.\"\nHe was asked if the Wolverines are better equipped to handle a team like MSU this season.\n\"We have that confidence and swagger about us,\" Smith said. \"I feel we believe in each other. We believe we can win next week.\"\nangelique.chengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:45:35.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
