Then why two farmers committed suicide in last one week? What is the reason that people involved in recruitment rackets are not punished? Why innocent women are beaten up and sent to jail by police? Is this the Gujarat Model?\" Hardik said at a press conference.\nHe alleged that Patels are being subjected to violence by police and the state government delayed the local body polls for its benefit.\n\"Patels are being singled out by police and mercilessly thrashed. BJP-led Gujarat government brought an ordinance to delay the local body polls, for their benefit. Is this Gujarat Model? What will happen when such a model, for which our PM takes credit all the time, will be implemented across India?\" asked Hardik.\nThe 22-year-old convener of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) termed the Gujarat model as a \"myth\" and said he will \"expose\" the reality behind it.\n\"When such wrong and misleading notions about Gujarat Model is being spread by our leaders, which is totally against the reality here, we have decided to expose the well-propagated myth,\" he said.\nHardik, who is also president of Patidar Navnirman Sena (PNS), claimed that the outfit has presence in 16 states and its members will hold various programs across India, including Bihar, to educate their community through public gatherings.\n\"As of now, more than 56 lakh members have registered with PNS. Not just Bihar, we will organise programs in various parts of country to tell people about the atrocities police have committed on us in Gujarat,\" he said.\nHardik rejected state government's Rs 1,000 crore package announced recently for the students of economically backward class (EBC) sections of non-reserved category.\n\"We don't want such package. We want only reservation. If government claims that reservation can't be given as per the present laws, then I want the government to explain to us, under which laws it cannot give us reservation,\" said Hardik.\nHardik apprised PAAS will organise a maha-panchayat of Patels at Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh on Sunsay.\nA mega rally is being planned in Rajkot in coming days while many other gatherings and rallies are in the pipeline at various places of Gujarat.
