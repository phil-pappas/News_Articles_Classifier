But among people with the inherited disorder, the blood doesn't clot, which can lead to dangerous bleeding episodes. Traditional treatments are based on plasma-derived products containing vitamin K-dependent proteins to stem or prevent bleeding, the agency said in a news release.\nCoagadex, derived from human blood plasma, has been approved for people 12 years and older to control and prevent random bleeding episodes, and those stemming from menstruation or recent surgery.\nThe product was evaluated in clinical studies of 16 people with the rare bleeding disorder, which affects men and women equally. No safety concerns were identified in these studies, the FDA said.\nCoagadex is manufactured by Bio Products Laboratory Ltd., based in the United Kingdom.\nMore information\nLearn more about this approval from the FDA ", "external_links": ["http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/", "http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm468038.htm"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:28:39.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
