So we'll see how we go. \n\"We've got to improve massively from what we did today, to even be in the hunt next week. \n\"We'll pick two or three things and try to make those things better. \n\"When you've got a team like New Zealand with so many threats, who are so well-drilled and have such a great coach you have to be working hard all the time. \n\"New Zealand have had a very different path from us to here. They will be feeling a little bit differently in their preparation. \n\"But it's a World Cup final and the adrenaline's going to be pumping and anyone who's a little bit sore will forget all about soreness next week.\" \nFormer Leinster and Waratahs boss Cheika only assumed the Wallabies job in October 2014, after Ewen McKenzie's resignation. \nThe taskmaster coach has transformed a talented but disparate group besieged by infighting and recrimination into potential world champions, and all inside 12 months. \nThe no-nonsense 48-year-old still batted away any praise when quizzed on how he has reversed Australia's fortunes however. \n\"I'm not taking credit for any type of that stuff,\" said Cheika. \n\"I don't know if we're turned around or anything, I just know guys are playing for each other, want to play for Australia and are committed when they take the field. \n\"That's the basis for a contact sport, and that's about it really.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:24:48.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
