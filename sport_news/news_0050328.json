The player usually makes frequent contact, has good speed, a high on-base percentage and brings energy to the team. \nAlcides Escobar possesses all but one of the above — the lone exception being his .293 OBP during the regular season. Statistically, the case can be made that Escobar should be batting in the lower third of the order, but at this point Royals manager Ned Yost isn’t planning on making any changes to his lineup. \n“My lineup’s my lineup,” Yost said. \nIt’s hard to argue with success, and the Royals have enjoyed remarkable success in the win column since Escobar was moved to the top late last season. Escobar, though, struggled mightily in the second half this year, and Yost eventually moved Alex Gordon and Ben Zobrist to the top spot in September. \nThe team, however, was winning with Escobar batting leadoff, and they went into their swoon when he was bumped down. The last week of the season, Yost moved Escobar back to the leadoff spot and the Royals finished the regular season on a five-game winning streak. \nNow Yost is hoping his unconventional formula and faith in Escobar can somehow carry them to the ALCS. \n“Esky’s a special player,” Yost said. “He’s got the ability to step up and be confident and help you win baseball games. I like him. I think everybody’s real, real confident with him.” \nEscobar always has been a free swinger, and he has a tendency to swing at the first pitch of the game. In their five-game win streak to close out the regular season, Escobar swung at the first pitch in every game. \n“I’m an aggressive hitter,” Escobar said. “I like to be aggressive. For me, that’s good because I like hitting in the leadoff spot. The manager’s the one who makes the final decision. If he wants me batting ninth, I’ll bat ninth. I just want to win.” \nIn Game 1 on Thursday, Escobar took the first pitch and the Royals ultimately lost. He went 0 for 4 with a strikeout. \nCoincidence? \n“I don't know what that is,” said Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer. “But when it works out for us, and when he gets a hit on the first pitch of the game, it kind of just sets the tone for us offensively. And at the same time for the opposing pitcher, it kind of puts him in a little hole.” \nHouston leadoff hitter Jose Altuve is one of the best in the game. Like Escobar, he brings energy to his team, but he has more power. In Game 1, Altuve got three hits, but it was his first at-bat that set the tone for the rest of the game for Houston. He took the first pitch and then singled and eventually came around to score. \n“What Jose’s been doing over there for the past couple years, and the years he’s been putting up and just the spark that he’s bringing to that team every day is something special to watch,” Hosmer said. “It’s something fun to watch. But at the same time, being on the opposing team, we’ve got to figure a way to shut him down.” \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:44:35.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
