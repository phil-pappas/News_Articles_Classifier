The hardware has been on display in the Robert Troop Center since AU's 17-7 win last season over the Chargers. \nIt's up for grabs again Saturday when the eighth-ranked Eagles (6-0) host Hillsdale (1-5) in a 1 p.m. Homecoming contest. The two teams have been playing each other almost yearly since 1970. \n\"It's a one-game season. When you play a rival...they're playing to win that trophy out there,\" AU coach Lee Owens said. \"If they put it together one time for four quarters and beat us, they take the trophy home. It's important for them to do that. We fought our tails off to get that trophy back here last year. We just don't want to give it up.\" \nThe first-ever meeting between the Eagles and Chargers came on 1970 Homecoming weekend. Ashland and Hillsdale have met on Ashland's Homecoming six times prior to 2015, with the Eagles prevailing five times. \nAU kicker Aidan Simenc is the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Player of the Week after hitting a career-high four field goals in four attempts and three PATs for a career-high 15 points in the Eagles' 33-7 win at Saginaw Valley. \nSimenc is the second Eagle to win the honor this season, joining junior punter Austin Bruns. \nSimenc has been the Eagles' placement kicker in 12 games over the last two seasons, and is 14-for-16 on field goals and 49-for-54 on extra points. He has made six field goals in a row. \nSaturday's festivities will also see former head coach Gary Keller get recognized at halftime for being inducted into the AU Hall of Fame that morning. \nKeller ranks as one of the top assistant football coaches in Ashland history and became just the second Eagle head coach to lead the program to the NCAA Division II postseason. \nIn his 23 seasons at Ashland, Keller molded some of the best defenses in the country. The Eagles consistently ranked among Division II's best in various defensive statistical categories from 1990-94, including ranking as the country's top team in total defense in 1991 and 1992, and in rushing defense in 1992. \nKeller coached in the NCAA playoffs twice — in 1997 as head coach and in 1986 as an assistant. During that 1997 season, Ashland won a share of the Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference title, and Keller was named MIFC Coach of the Year. Keller guided the Eagles to six winning campaigns.
