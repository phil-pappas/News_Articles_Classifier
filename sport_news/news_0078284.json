There was a mouse in there. It was gross,” Jones told KGW .\nJones snapped a photo of the rodent between the spinach and the cheese. The mouse apparently was originally in the container for storing spinach.\nLocal heath inspectors were notified and followed up with an investigation.\nCheryl Connell, director of Lincoln County Health and Human Services, said the rodent did not come from inside the Lincoln City Subway. \"The inspector determined the most likely way the rodent got into the restaurant was through the bagged product the restaurant issues for the sandwiches,” Connell said.\nThe manager of the Subway was alerted, and Jones got a full refund.\nKGW contacted Subway franchise headquarters and received the following response:\n“As soon as the customer alerted the owner about what happened, they were immediately given a full refund and an investigation was launched. To be cautious, all of the products in the sandwich unit were disposed of and a thorough cleaning took place, (after) which the Health Department gave the restaurant a clean bill of health. There were no other complaints made.”\nICYMI Dead rodent found in Ore. #Subway sandwich http://t.co/NKfIZGwz6I pic.twitter.com/33OFdWkmL3\n— KGW News (@KGWNews) October 14, 2015 Read more here.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/33OFdWkmL3", "https://twitter.com/KGWNews/status/654280116416192512", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Subway?src=hash", "http://t.co/NKfIZGwz6I", "http://www.kgw.com/story/news/health/2015/10/13/dead-rodent-found-subway-sandwich-lincoln-city/73880190/"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:03:29.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
