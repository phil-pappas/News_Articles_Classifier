I expect mostly dry weather with the front however, we cold see a stray sprinkle here and there after midnight.\nAs the front pushes off the coast by mid morning Saturday, expect mostly sunny skies, warm days with lower humidity and cooler nights.\nHighs this weekend will range from the 80-85 range as lows dip into the lower 50s north to the upper 50s to lower 60s south. Sunday will be the cooler day of the weekend.\nFollow me on Twitter: @BruceKatzFOX8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:18:59.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
