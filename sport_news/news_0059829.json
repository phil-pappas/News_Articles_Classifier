Michigan Ave. and will be the largest of the retailer's 40-some U.S. locations, except for the New York flagship on Fifth Avenue.\nA long escalator, a signature element of Uniqlo stores, takes 85 seconds to ride from bottom to top. Uniqlo's store in Chicago will have about 400 workers, outnumbered by nearly 500 mannequins, many inside display cases in museum-like exhibits, while dozens more are visible from Water Tower Place across the street.\nChicago's Uniqlo store, among the five largest in the world, features a Starbucks with glass walls overlooking the street. The company's New York City flagship is the only other one with the coffee shop.\nDigital screen displays are found throughout the three floors. Cashmere sweaters come in seven additional colors not found in other Uniqlo stores. The Chicago store is the only one to have stock of Uniqlo's Lemaire collection, a collaboration with French designer Christophe Lemaire, which is sold out everywhere else, said Justin Kerr, Uniqlo's chief merchandising officer.\nUniqlo Chicago store tour Uniqlo will open its first Midwest store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago on Friday, Oct. 23.

(Greg Karp / Chicago Tribune)\nSee more videos Uniqlo executives said they scouted Chicago for years to identify the ideal retail space. The company's U.S. expansion has concentrated on the coasts.\nThe Michigan Avenue store is meant to be a showcase, in part to give Chicagoans and visitors a taste of Uniqlo so they feel comfortable ordering from the company's website. Uniqlo has no immediate plans for other locations in the Midwest.\nHowever, Neil Stern, a retail analyst and senior partner at Chicago-based McMillanDoolittle, said he expects that eventually Uniqlo will expand beyond showcase stores and add more stores to major shopping areas around Chicago.\nUniqlo's attraction is fundamental, Stern said. \"They offer great products at really affordable prices — that would be a simple way to describe them as a retailer,\" he said. \"That's its intrinsic consumer appeal.\"\nHe described the stores as \"beautiful, well-organized and colorful.\"\nThe Chicago store, in particular, is stocked with warm-weather clothes for the cold and windy winters. The store also has a dedicated section of Disney and Star Wars children's apparel, with some patterns exclusive to Uniqlo, Meyer said.\nAs this location opens, it will be a testing ground for a new company strategy of interacting with customers on their smartphones — via the Uniqlo app — while they're in the store. That might include shopping and styling tips, discounts and a store map.\nUniqlo is often referred to as a fast-fashion retailer, a category that targets young buyers by matching the latest trends with low-priced apparel. However, company officials bristle at the term because it can also connote low-quality clothing.\nUniqlo was founded in Hiroshima in 1984 by Tadashi Yanai, often reported as the richest person in Japan. Yanai has boldly expressed a desire for Uniqlo to be the largest apparel retailer in the world by 2020.\nSo far, the company has more than 1,600 stores in 16 markets worldwide and has nearly doubled the number of U.S. locations in the past year.\ngkarp@tribpub.com\nTwitter @spendingsmart\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56291708/turbine/ct-uniqlo-opening-1022-biz-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56290610/turbine/ct-uniqlo-chicago-store-tour-video-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:32:47.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
