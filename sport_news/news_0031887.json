You have to come in ready to play defence, ready to shoot that three or a jump shot or whatever you have.\n“You have to be almost in a lather when you come off the bench. He’s adjusted to it, he’s had the whole summer knowing . . . so the mindset is there.”\nOn July 9, the day the Raptors signed free agent DeMarre Carroll was the day Ross became a backup, so the six-foot-seven native of Portland has had time to prepare himself for a new job that includes much more responsibility.\nThe Raptors’ second unit is not chock full of offensive ability and it will fall on Ross to be the team’s primary scorer off the bench, and he’ll have to do it quickly each night. There will be no chance to ease into a game, to gauge its flow before picking his spots.\n“It’s an opportunity to have a big role in the offence and have a big role defensively, doing it all,” Ross said here Friday. “I just get to be more assertive early . . . you have to come out and instead of waiting for someone to get you involved, you have to actually go out there and make something happen yourself.”\nRoss was an integral part of what will be Toronto’s primary regular season rotation here Friday night.\nComing off the bench about seven minutes in the first quarter of a 92-82 win over the Washington Wizards at the Bell Centre, he had an innocuous three points in 23 minutes as the pre-season wrapped up.\nDoing what he said he would, Casey stretched out his regulars to much closer to regular season minutes, using nine players into the fourth quarter before turning to Anthony Bennett and Delon Wright.\nThe most telling decision was starting Luis Scola over Patrick Patterson , but the nine who are expected to log the bulk of the minutes did.\nCarroll had 16 points, Kyle Lowry 13, DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas had 12 apiece for the Raptors.\nRoss’s reasons for needing a big season go beyond just helping the Raptors have an excellent season — there’s money at stake.\nHe will become a restricted free agent in July if he and the Raptors don’t agree on a contract extension by Nov. 1, and a good seson could put him in line for a substantial raise from his current salary of about $3.5 million (U.S.).\nHis agent and the Raptors have had some minor talks about a new deal but the franchise is not about to overpay in money or years for a young player who has yet to put together a good full season. They would do a deal in a minute strictly on their terms, but Ross and his representatives know it could be more lucrative to hold off if he’s sure he’ll have a breakout season in his new role.\n“It’d be an honour to get it but if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen,” Ross said.\nMore on thestar.com\nBuffalo Bills hurting unit ahead of game in England\nEarly labour threw Jays reliever for a Loup", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:46:35.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
