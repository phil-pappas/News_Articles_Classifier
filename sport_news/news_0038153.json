But this year was a little different. The return envelope enclosed, typically addressed for the Tax Collector’s Office in San Andreas, was addressed to the Del Norte County Tax Collector’s office in Crescent City. “If somebody doesn’t bother to check their envelope, all the money that is supposed to go into the general fund for Nov. 1 when it’s due, late on Dec. 10, gets sent to the incorrect city,” said Meyer. Barbara Sullivan, Calaveras County tax collector, said the mistake occurred during the printing process. The printer — a Stockton-based enterprise — printed out 33,000 county tax bills, the final 5,000 of which included the incorrect return address. When they got to the last 5,000, they inserted Del Norte County as a return envelope,” said Sullivan. “It was only 5,000 of 33,000, but that’s still a lot.” Sullivan says the printer caught the mistake — doing a basic inventory survey and noticing that Calaveras County had a surplus of tax bill envelopes left over — and is working to correct it. “He’s printing out more today and printing out a correction notice today to those affected by the mass billing error,” Sullivan said. “They should be getting notice in mail. They’re going out today and should be in by the weekend.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:03:52.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
