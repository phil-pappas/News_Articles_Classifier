But her chief rival for the nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has pushed hard against the big financial institutions, and he's co-sponsored a bill to restore the law that once separated commercial and investment banking, known as Glass-Steagall. \n\"If you only reinstate Glass-Steagall you don't go after all these other institutions,\" Clinton said when asked if she would try to bring the law back. \"What I'm proposing is that we go after the risk. If they are too big to manage, that's a risk and they should not continue.\" \nClinton said she would offer a comprehensive plan designed to deal with problems in the future. She pledged to hold individuals responsible for bad behavior and said she would enforce and implement the Dodd-Frank law passed by Congress in 2010, which tightened regulation of financial institutions. \nClinton said she would \"go after what I think are the real problems, not the problems of the past, but the problems of today.\" \nDuring two stops in Iowa, Clinton also said she would support small business, spending on public infrastructure and providing more help to the poor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:46:08.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
