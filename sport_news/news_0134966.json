He followed that late in the half with a 91-yard drive ending with a six-yard strike to Tiquan Underwood and in the third with an 87-yard catch-and-run to Terrell Sinkfield.\n\nHamilton Tiger-Cats wide receiver Tiquan Underwood (1) celebrates after a catch during the first half of CFL football action against the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Hamilton on Friday, October 9, 2015. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Peter Power \nIt was Mathews' second career start after taking over for the injured Zach Collaros midway through Week 13's loss against Edmonton. This is his first win.\nBrett Smith, the rookie pivot who replaced starter Kevin Glenn to start the second half for Saskatchewan, hit Weston Dressler for a 79-yard catch-and-run TD and Ryan Smith with a 68-yard TD strike. He also threw one interception.\nHamilton snapped a two-game losing skid to improve to 9-5 and take sole possession of first place in the CFL East. Saskatchewan falls to 2-13 and is last in the West.\nHamilton kicker Justin Medlock hit all three field-goal attempts, from 25, 44 and 18 yards.\nSaskatchewan kicker Paul McCallum missed from 27 yards out.\nHamilton took a 20-0 lead into the third quarter.\nGlenn made 11-of-17 pass attempts for 67 yards and one interception in the first half and was replaced by Smith to start the third quarter. Smith's opening drive ended with an interception by Courtney Stephen at the Saskatchewan 21 and returned to the 18. But Hamilton later failed to get the first down on a botched fake 22-yard field-goal attempt and the Roughriders got the ball back on their own eight.\nThree plays later, Smith found the wide-open Dressler downfield and the score was 20-7 at 4:53 into the second half.\nHamilton got that back four minutes later when Sinkfield escaped a tackle after a 10-yard pass from Mathews and ran it the rest of the way for an 87-yard score and the 27-7 lead.\nMedlock's 18-yard field goal with 4:34 left in the game followed by Smith's 68-yard TD catch-and run, with a two-point convert with 1:57 left, finished the scoring.\nNotes: Attendance at Tim Hortons Field was 24,222.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:48:34.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
