These winds could also lead to some minor coastal flooding.\nA few stray showers, like yesterday, are possible for the next few days, but coverage remains less than 20%. By Sunday, however, tropical moisture comes surging back over the area with a developing surface low.\nThis will finally bring rain back to the region. It looks like the rain may stick around through early Wednesday. We could use the rain.\nFollow me on Twitter: @BruceKatzFOX8\n- Meteorologist Bruce Katz\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
