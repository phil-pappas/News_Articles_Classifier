Last night he played three sets. He finished after midnight. Maybe that has influenced a little bit his game in the second set,” Djokovic said. “Then again, I’ve started to read his serve a little bit better, started to move him around the court. The first game of the second set was crucial, I think, making that break.”\nDespite the loss, Tomic remains focused on rising up the rankings, he is now projected to reach a career high of 18.\nWorld No.1 Novak Djokovic of Serbia returns a shot against Bernard Tomic.
