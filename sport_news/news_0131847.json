The timing is curious, because Albertsons, which acquired Safeway in January, postponed its initial public offering last week in the wake of “recent market volatility.” \nSafeway previously sponsored an LPGA event in Portland, Ore., from 1996 through 2013. Albertsons also has history in golf, as title sponsor of a Web.com Tour event in Boise (site of its corporate headquarters) since 2002. \nThis new deal at Silverado runs through 2020, resolving swirling uncertainty about the tournament’s future. Johnny Miller , the Hall of Famer and NBC analyst, is part of Silverado’s ownership group and had been lobbying to keep the event at the resort. \nFry’s Electronics has sponsored the tournament since 2007 — first in Scottsdale, Ariz., then at CordeValle in San Martin and the past two years in Napa. CEO John Fry hoped to move the event to his ultra-private Institute Course in Morgan Hill, but lingering permitting issues have delayed plans to build an elaborate, castle-like clubhouse there. \nFry’s officials still hope to one day host another tour event at the Institute. \nHeads up, Rory: Rory McIlroy shot 71 and faded into the pack Saturday, tied for 39th. He also nearly got drilled as he stood on the 17th green. \nPGA Tour officials moved up the tee on that hole, turning it into a drive-able par-4 at 296 yards. The group behind McIlroy’s mistakenly thought the green was clear, so Emiliano Grillo , a 23-year-old rookie from Argentina, let it rip. \nGrillo’s tee shot did not miss McIlroy by much. \n“It would have put me out of my misery, to be honest with you,” McIlroy said. \nGrillo was apologetic afterward. He smiled sheepishly when asked about almost hitting, of all people, the biggest-name player in the field. \n“That would have been bad,” Grillo said. \nBriefly: Andrew Loupe hit 17 of 18 greens in regulation on his way to a third-round 63. Loupe, a 26-year-old from Louisiana, made 10 birdies in all. … James Hahn , who grew up in Alameda and attended Cal, climbed into a tie for 20th after shooting 68. … Saturday’s secondary cut, used when too many players make the 36-hole cut, sent nine golfers home, including 12-time tour winner Justin Leonard . \nRon Kroichick is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
