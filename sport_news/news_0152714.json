The 21-year-old has impressed during 43 first-team appearances for Santos since being promoted from the club’s youth ranks last year, reports Xinhua. Zeca was called up for Brazil’s under-23 friendlies against the Dominican Republic and Haiti this month before being ruled out with a hip injury. According to reports in the Brazilian media on Thursday, Benfica have indicated they are willing to pay four million euros for the defender. Zeca last month extended his contract with Santos until 2018 with a reported buyout clause of six million euros.
