Rick Bamman - hbamman@chicagofootball.com \nThe Bears released veteran defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff on Thursday and signed D-lineman Ziggy Hood. \n“We felt moving forward without Jeremiah was in the best interest of our team,” Bears general manager Ryan Pace said in a statement. “We appreciate his contributions and wish him well. We are also excited to be able to add Ziggy Hood to our roster.” \nRatliff, who turned 34 in late August, was suspended for the first three games of the season following a 2013 DWI charge. He missed Week Four because of an ankle injury suffered in the preseason. \nAccording to multiple reports, Ratliff was involved in a heated discussion with Pace outside Halas Hall. The Chicago Tribune reported that Ratliff was originally sent home after he reported to the facility not in a condition to work. \nIn his two games, Ratliff played in 78 snaps and made eight tackles. The D-lineman started 11 games last season and was second on the team with 6.5 sacks. He had 1.5 sacks in five games with the Bears in 2013. Ratliff went to four Pro Bowls with the Cowboys during his eight seasons in Dallas. \nHood, 28, is a 6-foot-3, 300-pounder who played in all 16 games for the Jaguars last season and had 24 tackles and one sack with zero starts. He played for the Steelers from 2009-13, appearing in every game during that span. A 2009 first-round pick out of Missouri, Hood has 164 career tackles, 12.5 sacks and seven passes defensed. \nThe Jaguars placed Hood on injured reserve with a foot injury on Sept. 5. He was released on Tuesday. \nWhen the new regime took over and Vic Fangio implemented a 3-4 defense, John Fox and Fangio singled out Ratliff as a player to build the defense around. Now, Hood joins a group that is also without Ego Ferguson, who was placed on injured reserve. The Bears have only two players on the roster who started the 2014 season opener on defense — Lamarr Houston and Shea McClellin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:48:05.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
