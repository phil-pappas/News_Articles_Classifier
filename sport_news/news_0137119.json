We simply wrap our microwave-ready confections in a moist paper towel and steadfastly reheat those items in an effort to attain perfect harmony between palate and legacy. Furthermore, Louisville Men strive to pass down these basic principles of radiation and thermodynamics to future generations of Louisville Men. We do this proudly, as members of a distinguished microwave-driven society of microwave loving Louisville Men. Some may say that we overuse pop culture catch phrases that do not actually do for our arguments what we think they do. To them, I say, “We are Louisville Men and Women. You’re not supposed to understand how our microwaves work.” Catgrad7072 October 12, 2015 at 4:04 pm | Permalink \nWell played Dieter; you are the ‘Afternoon Internet Champion!’ D de October 12, 2015 at 4:09   \nA nightmare for me would be some day one of my daughters to bring home a “Louisville Man” who looks like this dude at the top of this page. I don’t know what I would do! A Louisville Man October 12, 2015 at 4:37   \nI think it is admirable for Mark Blankenbaker to describe what he stays for as a “Louisville Man.” He is wrong about the people he named at the University of Louisville being that type of man. I mean he is REALLY off-base. I mean as far off as he could possibly be.. However, to say you (Matt Jones) would not describe yourself as a Kentucky Man or a “your hometown” Man is disappointing. Take some pride in your hometown and describe what type of man you would call yourself. Present that idea to other people from the state/town and hope they may want to strive for those same character traits. I agree with Mark and the first couple of paragraphs describing a man someone should strive to be from Louisville or the State of Kentucky. After describing a Louisville Man, he should have asked for support in kicking out Bobby, Rick, Tom, and Ramsey. In that case, this article would have been praised and not condemned.

Being a Louisville Man or even a Kentucky Man simply drips with douchebaggery. \nThe attributes which the author attempts to claim as the sole purview of the “Louisville Man” could and should be claimed by any male attempting to be a decent human being, regardless of alma mater or geographic origin. To then claim as examples, people whose actions display the exact opposite of those aforementioned virtues is what takes Mark’s essay into the realm of ridiculous fantasy, deserving of all mockery and derision that it receives.

Y’all are so insecure with your basketball only athletic program that you spend more time in one day talking about Louisville that Louisville spends talking about you all year. I like to come here to check on your insecurities. \nBut wait you say…we are 4-1 in football.

It is not even sport anymore to pick on them. They have no defense. On second thought, three things. They just continually set themselves up for the fall so why not. Second, they don’t seem to have the capacity to learn from their mistakes. Third, we all need some levity in our lives and with such a rich source 80 miles down the road, just to good to pass up.

Catsrus October 12, 2015 at 7:10 pm | Permalink \nI’ve been thinking the UL scandal has many of the same elements as the Penn State Football one starring Jerry Sandusky. Underage sexual abuse and a out of the loop head coach. Hard to imagine what might be done in court about institutional sexual exploitation of minors. Stay tuned. KevinM October 12, 2015 at 4:43   \nMTT, I don’t envy you having to research UL and their improprieties that seem to come out EVERY year. \nIs there another university in the entire country that allows this type of behavior? UNC is the closest thing that comes to mind. KT October 12, 2015 at 5:17 pm | Permalink \n“Research” is a strong word. This crap pretty much writes itself since Jurich took over that program a few years back. Matt just gets up and walks outside in Louisville and he has like 30 minutes of material right there. \nYou bring up a good point though, there has been at least one sex scandal annually for like a decade. That’s pretty amazing. Maybe we should try to get a Hall Mark holiday in UL’s honor, hell, there’s one for about everything else but there has to be a couple days left “un-hall marked” out of 365. Bobbum man October 12, 2015 at 4:47   \nThis is just a perfect example of the typical delusional UL fan. Even after everything pitino has done they still prop him up like some supreme example of what a person should be. Just beyond laughable, honestly they make it too easy anymore.

Tommycatsfan October 12, 2015 at 5:16   \nA Louisville man is also tattooed up. Doesn’t have a job and doesn’t wear a shirt other than a wife beater. But he does have a line beard and a gold tooth. A Louisville man supports an athletic department that hires male whores and recruits criminals kicked out of other schools. I could go on and on about traits of a Louisville man. The most incredible trait is the ability to believe their school is a national football powerhouse (I just threw up in my mouth) and on par with UK in basketball . Uh… Not. But I am admittedly not a Louisville man….. My parents raised me better. Tommycatsfan October 12, 2015 at 5:17   \nA Louisville man is trash. Just sayin…. Tommy Boy Jurich October 12, 2015 at 5:49   \nOk, so between Ricky, Bobby, McGee and all the felons and low life athletes, we just barely missed the target for being decent human beings. I want to be clear, I have never read or endorsed anything written or implied by over zealous fans, that constantly break into our players cell phones and tweet, text, email crazy messages and pictures. This ULSheriff50 dude appears to be another cellar dweller with delusional aspirations, we just can’t achieve with the coaches and players we get. So please modify the expectations down a lot.
