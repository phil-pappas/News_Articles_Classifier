With the Hornets coming in at 5-1 overall compared to 2-4 for the Pirates, Blank said he wanted the team to come out fast to start both halves against Fulton. As it turned out, it was the Hornets who got off to a fast start with 14 unanswered points in the first quarter and a 13-7 edge in the third quarter to beat Boonville by a score of 47-13. While the loss dropped Boonville to 2-5 overall and 1-4 in the NCMC, Blank said he knew the Hornets had a lot of weapons offensively and were coming in with a lot of confidence. “They are a good team,”Blank said, “and it didn’t help that we came out flat. We talked to our kids about starting fast but then they get off to a 14-0 lead after we muffed a punt. I thought we were in the game even though we were down 27-6 at the half. Then, in the second half, we come out and score to cut the lead to a two score game and then let them drive down the field on a 11-play drive. We have to find our confidence and ourselves as a team. It’s just an attitude that our kids have to really believe it that you can fight through adversity.” The Pirates faced plenty of adversity Friday night. Aside from playing from behind all night, it didn’t help that Fulton hit paydirt on its second possession of the game after a muffed punt by Boonville. But that’s exactly what happened as the Hornets took advantage of a short field by scoring on a 19-yard run from senior running back Travis Dean to make it 7-0 with 7:35 left in the first quarter. Dean also scored on a 50-yard run after the Pirates turned the ball back over to Fulton on downs at the Hornets 20. However, on the sixth play of the drive, Dean broke several tackles on his way to the end zone for his second touchdown to extend the lead to 14-0. Although Dean and quarterback Devin Masek figured on all seven touchdowns by the Hornets, the Pirates had their chances while cutting the lead to eight at 14-6 after a six-yard run by junior running back Keon Johnson with 11:20 left in the second quarter. Meanwhile, after exchanging punts, Fulton came back with a seven-play drive from its own 43 to hit paydirt for the third time on a 2-yard run by Masek to push the lead to 20-6. The Pirates had two three and outs to closeout the half while Fulton struck again on a 16-yard run by Dean with 55 seconds remaining to go in at the half on top by a score of 27-6.
