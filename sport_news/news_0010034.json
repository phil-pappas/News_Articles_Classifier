Sadly, this is not always a pleasant experience due to the lack of maintenance and pride shown by businesses in the area. Many sidewalks are in poor repair and parking lots covered in weeds and trash.\nThere are some businesses that do a great job – the owners take the time to sweep in front in the morning and patrol for trash on their property. But too many look virtually abandoned.\nWe can do better than this, and I think that those businesses belonging to the Chamber of Commerce should take a leadership role in trying to exemplify what it is we want our community to be.\nCYNTHIA ANDERSON\nAlbuquerque\nMen on their way to becoming superfluous\nTO ALL THOSE sorry little creatures who consider a woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices a threat to their manhood, listen up! You would be better served by limiting a woman’s right to study genetics.\nIn the not-too-distant future, we will be able to stimulate a human ovum to divide and, eventually, form a fetus without fertilization by a sperm. Of course, without the Y chromosome, all resulting babies will be female.\nThink about it. A world without men. This could mean a significant reduction in war, spousal abuse, bar fights, football, boxing, rape, infidelity, mid-life crises and chest-thumping idiocy in government, international relations and resource management. We may keep a few decorative men around, but they would have to accept their subservient role.\nHeads up! The genie is female and she’s about to break out of the bottle.\nADELE E. ZIMMERMANN\nEmbudo\nRepresentatives hypocritical on abortion\nON SEPT. 18, 177 U.S. House of Representative Democrats voted “no” to a piece of legislation designed to protect babies who survive the abortion procedure. New Mexico’s two House of Representative Democrats – who list Catholic as their religious preference – were among the “no” voters on passage of this issue.\nI think it is outrageous and hypocritical that these individuals cannot put politics aside in order to protect the human life they claim to “champion.” The poor, downtrodden and unprotected in our society includes these babies. Shame on you for your lack of moral integrity here.\nAs a citizen and Christian of this country, I felt the need to step up and call out those so-called leaders, whose social and moral speech and actions do not coincide with who they would like us to believe they really are. We can do better! We can’t continue to tolerate the social and moral decay in our society. I stepped up in writing this. We need to make a change.\nRUSTY ARRIGHETTI\nAlbuquerque\nFreedom more sacred than church opinion\nIN YOUR COVERAGE of the meeting between … Kim Davis and Pope Francis, the formulaic statement “marriage is between a man and a woman” is used to describe the pope’s beliefs. I would ask my fellow citizens to think carefully about this thing between a man and a woman; is it a sacred bond or a civil contract? For most of us it’s both. We exchange our vows in church, but we also sign some papers afterwards, don’t we?\nNow, if my church says a marriage can be a sacred bond between a man and a man or a woman and a woman, that’s religious freedom in action. The American government cannot prevent two consenting adults from entering into a civil contract. And as far as I’m concerned, that freedom is what’s sacred here.\nJIMMY ABRAHAM\nAlbuquerque\nDivert abortion funds to hospital shuttles\nIN THE WAITING room (recently), a fellow – lady – patient sat down next to me and immediately expressed her anger over the parking situation. This lady is a long-time visitor to Presbyterian Hospital it turns out. She took her late husband there, over 20 years ago, for years of treatment. The parking situation was tough on patients even then.\nI am fairly mobile at 65, but she is not, nor are the many patients you see making their way to and from the crowded and distant parking lots. Many walk slowly and painfully up the hill.\nThe sad stories she had about parking were numerous, but she suggested a shuttle, and I thought, “what a great idea.” Not everyone can afford the valet service continually or find a nearby parking space.\nHas Presbyterian considered this kind of service?\nMay I suggest our tax dollars would be well spent to fund efficient shuttle services at all hospitals. Why? Because someday you or I or someone you are caretaking will not be able to negotiate the parking lots. Many people don’t have someone to drop them off at the main door. Or, they don’t want to trouble someone to take them.\nAirports have shuttles, why not hospitals? Doesn’t it just make sense?\nAnd while I’m talking about tax dollars, how many people know that we are paying for abortions? That’s right, we are – whether we agree with it or not. Late-term abortions cost $30,000 and up.\nWhy not divert Albuquerque abortion money, which destroys a child’s and a mother’s life, to the support of life by helping those many handicapped people get to the hospital painlessly, by shuttle?\nLARA STARK\nAlbuquerque\nAnimal shelters deserve positive coverage\nIT’S BEGINNING to appear that the Journal and some of its reporters have some sort of personal vendetta against Barbara Bruin (outgoing director of the Animal Welfare Department). There may be issues, but are you going to tarnish every single good thing that she did for the city and homeless animals?\nOctober is Adopt a Shelter Dog month. I would be very interested to see you “investigate” all the good things about the city shelters, in addition to all the good work done by every other shelter and rescue in this state.\nBy continuing to shovel dirt and doubt, all you’re accomplishing is to demoralize the people who work tirelessly every day to save the city – and state’s – homeless, unwanted, abused pets.\nI would also like to see you use some of your valuable front page space to spotlight a homeless pet from the city shelters every day until we don’t have to euthanize for space. Let’s see the Journal step up to be a community partner.\nRAMONA GALLEGOS\nBosque Farms\nSpeed up imposition of death penalties\nEXECUTION BY lethal injection for the crime of involvement in a murder plot is not cruel and not unusual punishment (“Georgia executes female inmate,” Sept. 30).\nExecution by any means 18 years after committing the crime is not unusual but is certainly cruel. Death sentences should be carried out within 90 days of conviction or should be commuted to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. If there is so much uncertainty about the justness of the sentence that execution is strung out over many years, then the sentence of death should not have been imposed in the first place.\nAUGUSTINE R. LETTO\nAlbuquerque\nObamacare is ‘Cadillac tax’ writ large\nSEN. MARTIN HEINRICH now wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s so-called “Cadillac tax” because “it will impact middle-class families,” (“‘Cadillac tax’ could eliminate some health coverage,” Sept. 27). Yet, he vigorously supported Obamacare at town hall meetings here in New Mexico, spoke passionately on its behalf on the Senate floor and voted enthusiastically for its passage. He knew full well – back in March 2010 – that the entire law is really a massive tax on the middle class.\nThe following is a list of new or increased, indirect taxes on the middle class and on small business written into the Affordable Care Act. The monies raised will pay for expansion of the federal bureaucracy. They do not pay for health care. Obamacare taxes include: “Black Liquor” – bio-fuel – tax; Blue Cross/Blue Shield tax; Cadillac tax; charitable hospital excise tax; earned income tax; employer mandate tax; health insurers tax; health savings account withdrawal tax; innovator drug tax; medical device tax; Medicare payroll tax – increased; medicine cabinet tax; net investment income tax; new sales tax on all health insurance plans; personal penalty tax, formerly the individual mandate; and tanning salon tax.\nEvery one of these taxes is aimed, as they said quietly in Washington, “where the money is” – in middle class pockets.\nThe senator cannot say the Cadillac tax hits and hurts the middle class without admitting the whole Obamacare law does the exact same thing.\nIn the same article, Sen. Heinrich claimed that (the) Affordable Care Act has “given thousands of New Mexicans access to quality, affordable health care for the first time.” It has, indeed, given free insurance to more than 200,000 newly insured New Mexicans through the Medicaid expansion.\nI await Sen. Heinrich’s evidence that proves that Obamacare insurance will translate to timely, quality care for the citizens of the Land of Enchantment. Like every other doctor in this great country, I am concerned that the Affordable Care Act takes money away from patient care services to pay for health care bureaucracy.\nDEANE WALDMAN, MD\nAlbuquerque\nMayor Berry’s too eager to add positions\nINVARIABLY, WHEN a city department under Mayor R. J. Berry finds itself in a dysfunctional, situation, e.g., Transit and Animal Welfare departments, the mayor reacts by unnecessarily throwing taxpayer money at the problem by creating new personnel positions, without offsetting deletions.\nThat is an incredibly troubling trend, especially for a mayor who professes to be a political conservative.\nROBERT E. GURULE\nAlbuquerque\nAbortion ban would be archaic, dangerous\nWHY DO REPUBLICANS feel that they are the law? Not just that they are above the law, but that they determine what the laws are. … To hell with the shrinking middle class, economic woes, immigration problems, environmental issues or any other problems our country suffers from. They are acting like little children throwing a temper tantrum when things do not go their way.\nAbortion seems to be their No. 1 issue. Why? What do they hope to accomplish other then sending women’s health issues back to the Stone Age? Do they think that returning to a time when abortions were illegal will stop abortions?\nI worked in a hospital on the lower east side of Los Angeles and saw women die from botched back alley and self-inflicted abortions many years before abortion became legal. Republican views on women’s issues are just plain archaic, not to mention criminal in nature.\nGAIL BENJAMIN\nAlbuquerque\nLead young refugees to liberate nations\nAM I THE only one who has noticed the majority of Middle East refugees we see in national news videos are young men of military service age? Simultaneously, the current administration admits it can only produce a literal handful – four to nine – of fighters to “degrade and destroy” ISIS.\nReal leadership would work to care for the women, children and elderly of these refugees while arming and leading those men back into battle to reclaim their homelands. If the men refuse, then they and their families can be sent back to the country for which they refuse to defend. We should only help those willing to help themselves.\nBut to do this, (President Barack) Obama needs to step up and allow the refugees to take out (Syrian President Bashar al-)Assad or others they are fleeing, not just ISIS. If you believe the “vast majority” are just good average people fleeing tyranny, then you should believe any new government they create would also be in their best interests. These are the people we need to cast our lot with, not existing corrupt officials. We also don’t need to impose our culture, we just need to stick around long enough to make sure new compassionate governments have been entrenched within the borders of their choice not ours.\nSpare me the high-minded lectures while the Middle East is destroyed and Western nations flooded with people fleeing instability created by Obama’s naïve foreign policy. There are only Russia and Iran willing to fill the vacuum this president has created and I trust America and her allies much more than these ideological and theological tyrants. There is no other benevolent superpower to which we can abdicate our responsibility.\nThis issue is of historic proportions requiring real leadership making hard choices not those that bow to the winds of vocal political minorities and a benighted citizenry.\nLeaders lead, politicians follow.\nEVERETT SMITH\nAlbuquerque", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:24:11.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
