Comment By Dan Cagen/Daily News Staff   By Dan Cagen/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 5:39 PM Updated Oct 24, 2015 at 5:41 PM By Dan Cagen/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 5:39 PM Updated Oct 24, 2015 at 5:41 PM Starting Friday, the third year of the state’s current football playoff system will begin. In Eastern Massachusetts, there will be six playoff divisions filled with eight teams each. Quarterfinals will be played Friday and Saturday. It’s an opportunity to play postseason football for 48 EMass teams, a chance that didn’t exist for many before the current system was adopted in the 2013 season. Beginning next year, an invite to the dance could be extended to a few more schools. Last week, the MIAA Football Committee voted to make changes to the current format. The most prominent change is adding two divisions to Eastern Mass., creating eight state champions instead of six. The divisions will have a balanced number of teams and alignments will be based strictly on enrollment. All that stands between the changes becoming reality is a final vote Monday by the MIAA’s tournament management committee for approval. The current postseason format was voted on in 2012, with a primary reason being an effort to reduce the number of state champions. Under the previous system, there were 19 Super Bowls, which were more district championships than anything resembling a state title. This vote sees a bit of a reversal in that line of thinking, a reflection of a compromise for those who are not fans of the current system and wish to reduce the number of consolation games, among other factors. “I think into the third year and moving forward here, I think the district representatives here are trying to bring forth the concerns brought up, even if there’s just a couple,” Franklin coach Brad Sidwell, a member of the Football Committee, told ESPNBoston.com . “I don’t think any system’s going to please everybody, but I think this is, in my opinion, a good way to move forward. “When you’re representing a group of 64 schools and you have people that feel that way, you have to at least bring it to the table.” Central Mass. will remain at six divisions, while Western Mass. will keep its status quo of four divisions. For Eastern Mass., the format could mean a watered-down postseason. With only six divisions, it was not uncommon for a 3-4 team to reach the postseason. With 16 more teams now qualifying, the threshold for playoff qualification will drop. “At the end of the day, I think the way it is now is it was fine,” Milford coach Joe Todd said. “Everybody has an opportunity, and to add more teams I guess is fine, but I think to make the playoffs even now, it seemed like a great opportunity. Now it’ll be a little easier. Page 2 of 2 - “Last year, there were teams at 3-4 getting in. I think you should have to have a minimum of a .500 record, I think you should be a top-two team in the league. I’m all for opportunities for everyone. The teams that get in should be getting in, and I think it’s great that there’s a consolation system for teams to keep playing and get better.” The change should positively impact the teams in the lower divisions the most. Those were the divisions that were imbalanced. While Division 2 South has just 11 teams — meaning over 72 percent of the teams will reach the postseason — in Division 6 South, there are 21 teams. That drops the number of qualifiers to 38 percent, below the roughly 50 percent that is standard in other sports. There has been a push to get all football divisions to close to that number. “I think it makes it more balanced across the state,” Xaverian athletic director and football coach Charlie Stevenson told ESPNBoston.com . “That push really came from the teams in the lower levels and it came from the Coaches Association in the proposal because they’re looking at 12 teams in Division 1 and eight are qualifying, whereas there were 25 teams in Division 6 and only eight are qualifying.” The change would likely result in some championship games being pushed out of Gillette Stadium, which has housed every Super Bowl since the current playoff format was instituted. Fort Foxboro can only host six games on Super Bowl Saturday, so at least two games would have to be played elsewhere. Dan Cagen can be reached at 508-626-3848 or dcagen@wickedlocal.com.
