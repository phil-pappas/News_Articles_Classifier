After throwing 50 pitches in relief of Dickey, he claims to be fine with it. \n“It doesn't matter,” Price said on Friday. “I mean, whatever the team wants me to do to try to help them win, I'm all about it. I knew I was going to be starting one of these games. \n“I completely get it and I'll be ready to go (on Saturday.)\" \nPrice had a 2.93 earned run average in two starts against the Royals this year and may match up better against them than he did against the Rangers. That's what the Jays are hoping for anyway. \nAs brilliant as Price has been during the regular season -- and as big a part he played in the team getting to the post season -- he has struggled in the playoffs. He'll bring a 2-6 post-season, win-loss record into Saturday's contest. \n“No, I know it's going to come,” Price said when asked Friday whether he is feeling nervous about his past playoff efforts. “I have 100% confidence in myself. I know my teammates do as well -- and our coaching staff. \n“This is a part of it. You've got to be able to live in the moment. I want to be able to step up for my teammates and this organization and all our fans in Canada.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:34:36.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
