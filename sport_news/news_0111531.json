We’ve seen it in flashes. Now it’s time to see if Seattle can put together a complete performance more reminiscent of the dominant teams we’ve come to expect in recent seasons. The Hawks looked more or less like themselves again through three quarters against Cincinnati, racing out to a seemingly commanding 24-7 lead. But they self-destructed on both sides of the ball in the fourth quarter and overtime, failing to put together sustained drives on offense and doing little to stop Andy Dalton and the Bengals defensively.Finishing off and burying the opposition has been a hallmark of Seattle’s back-to-back NFC championship seasons, making the inconsistency and inability to close teams out the most unsettling aspect of the team’s 2-3 start. The home matchup in Week 6 presents the Seahawks with a golden opportunity to correct those finishing woes and whether or not they can do so figures to be the prevailing storyline in Week 6.

Seattle’s running game has managed to stay afloat in Lynch’s absence, mostly thanks to the emergence of undrafted rookie Thomas Rawls, who gashed Cincinnati for 169 yards on 23 carries last week. But Lynch is still the league’s leading rusher since 2011 and his punishing style is key in establishing Seattle’s offensive identity. Assuming he’s healthy, look for Lynch to resume his duties as the feature back and for the Seahawks to feed their beast regularly.

After taking the brunt of the criticism and blame for Seattle’s rough offensive start, the Seahawks’ offensive line put in an improved effort against the Bengals. They controlled the line of scrimmage adequately enough to allow Rawls to rattle off 169 yards and gave Russell Wilson time to throw much more consistently than had been the case in previous weeks. It wasn’t perfect by any means (Wilson was still sacked four times and put under pressure on too many plays) but it was at least a step in the right direction for a group that badly needed to take one.Pete Carroll and offensive line coach Tom Cable have preached patience with the line, saying that they expect more consistent performances will come with more reps and experience playing with one another. Six weeks into the season, it’s time to see if that sentiment will end up becoming a reality. Can the O-line shine?

Linebacker Bobby Wagner, meanwhile, is questionable with a strained pectoral muscle. Hill’s absence hurts Seattle’s depth on the defensive line, but it’s the loss of Wagner that could end up having the biggest impact on Sunday’s game if it does turn out he's unable to go. The fourth-year pro has become one of the best middle linebackers in the NFL and you don’t need to look any further than Seattle’s performance last year when he missed time with a toe injury as evidence of the extent of his value to this defense.Seattle went 3-2 in the five games Wagner missed last season before rattling off eight straight victories and playing lockdown defense after he returned. He was also a first-team All-Pro despite only playing 11 games. If Wagner is forced out of action on Sunday, that will make the task of stopping Cam Newton and the Panthers all the more difficult for Seattle.

Sunday’s game marks the first time the Panthers will return to CenturyLink Field. For all of Seattle’s struggles through its first five games, CenturyLink is still one of the toughest places for opponents to play in the NFL –- something that Panthers quarterback Cam Newton struggled to adjust to in last year’s playoff matchup. But the Carolina signal-caller is one of the NFL’s more physically gifted quarterbacks and is surely feeling good with his squad coming into the game at 4-0.

Photo-8786343.118640 - seattlepi.com Image 6 of 6 Are the Panthers for real? It’s true that Carolina comes into Sunday’s matchup at 4-0. But keep in mind that those wins have hardly come against juggernaut opponents. The Panthers’ four victories have come against Jacksonville (1-4), Houston (1-4), New Orleans (1-4) and Tampa Bay (2-3). A 4-0 run is never anything to sneeze at in the NFL but the fact remains that a road game against the Seahawks presents the Panthers with easily the toughest matchup they’ve come across thus far on their early season schedule. Knocking off the Seahawks at CenturyLink in Week 6 wouldn’t clinch the Panthers a playoff spot, but it would be a statement that they will be a force to be reckoned with in the NFC this season.
