I might do the same thing,” Colomb said.\nNeighbor Mike Monahan says, “I can understand his frustration and anger. I don’t know that I would've done the same thing, but you never know.”\nThe chase didn’t last long. The coach fell, and according to the Saints, broke his wrist and tore his Achilles tendon.\nThe burglars took $40 from a wallet inside one of the cars, and the sense of security that so many residents of the Livingston Place subdivision used to have.\n“Pretty creepy just to know there are people like that outside of your home,” Monahan said.\nKen Domilise adds, “You just don’t really feel safe, you try to do what you can as a reasonable person. It’s just under these circumstances, it’s unbelievable.”\nThe Livingston Place Neighborhood Association already had plans to put up surveillance cameras on light poles and other fixtures, but after this incident, they say they're even more motivated to do so, and quickly.\n“Hopefully it'll prevent it or catch the people who are doing this,” Legrand said.\nWhile Andrea Legrand says it’ll take a few weeks to get the cameras, it only took Joe Vitt a few hours to return to work, a little batter and bruised, but with the added respect of the Who Dat nation.\nThe sheriff’s office says both Vitt’s vehicle and his neighbor’s car were unlocked.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
