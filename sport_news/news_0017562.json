Jordan and forward Earl Thompson Jr. have stepped up to be leaders on the team, but their level of play hasn’t dropped with the extra responsibility. Jordan posted 29 points, while Thompson drained 34 on Sunday as Brandon defeated the MacEwan University Griffins 114-107 in overtime in a pre-season game at the Healthy Living Centre. \nJordan, a six-foot-three, 180-pound Texan heading into his fourth year of eligibility, took over in the fourth quarter with back-to-back threes and another field goal to go along with some timely steals and a block. He has shown a lot of heart, playing Sunday with a bruise on the bottom of one of his fee, and adjusting to shooting guard from the point, where he normally played. But he’s loving it so far. \n“Last year I was playing the one (point guard) and (coach Gil Cheung) moved me to the two (shooting guard) because he wanted to get me better shot selection,” Jordan said. “That’s all I’ve been working on all summer is just shooting, so it looks like it’s paying off. \n“I’m used to having the ball all the time and just holding on to it. Now I’m coming off of it and have limited touches here and there. I just have to get used to it and coming off the ball better, so I’ve been working on that. I’m liking the looks I’m getting, especially when the ball is moving. When the ball is getting moved, we make good plays.” \nAlthough they’ve only played two exhibition games so far, it appears BU’s offensive woes will be a thing of the past. Brandon has been near the bottom of the Canada West conference rankings for the past five years by averaging no more than 74.2 points per game in any campaign. \nThey put up 200 total points in their first two pre-season games — including Thursday’s 103-86 loss to the Brock University Badgers — although 18 of those points came in an extra quarter. \nJordan and Cheung pointed out all the Bobcat players can finish and are offensive threats. However, defence is a big concern for them. \nThe Bobcats were beaten in transition a lot on Sunday and they struggled to grab rebounds on either end of the court. \n“We’re not 100 per cent healthy now and we’re missing some bigger bodies,” Cheung said. “Hopefully with added personnel and when everyone is healthy that aspect of the game will shore up itself. The energy was there for two games and defensively we have some things to work on, but I was proud of their effort for being this early in the year. \n“When you look at the lineup, they’re lucky they don’t have name tags out there because you don’t know who’s who really.” \nThe Bobcats’ next game comes on Oct. 23 when they visit the University of Manitoba Bisons. Their regular season begins on Nov. 6 when they host the University of Regina Cougars. \nJordan and Cheung were happy with the first two games of the pre-season, but they admit there’s a lot of room for growth still. \n“The first one I felt like we let that one go away. I thought we had that one, but I thought we overplayed,” Jordan said. “Everybody was excited to play. Some hadn’t played in a while, so everybody was excited to play and everything and we were too antsy. \n“This one we almost let it go away, but we had to bring it together. We can’t be that team that thinks it has that switch that we can flip it on and off. We have to be on at all times.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:33:35.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
