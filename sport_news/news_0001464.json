Minnesota Forward Justin Kloos attempts to score against Northeastern on Saturday at Mariucci Arena where the Gophers defeated the Huskies 4-3. By Mike Hendrickson October 26, 2015 The Gophers picked up their first two victories of the season in a weekend sweep, after stumbling out of the gate with a 0-3 start. No. 19 Minnesota (2-3) had no trouble generating offense over the weekend, scoring four goals in each home game against Northeastern. The Gophers scored seven first-period goals in the series, after only scoring one goal in their first three games. “It was a good two wins,” head coach Don Lucia said. “We obviously had to have two wins this weekend. We didn’t want to go into the off week losing tonight , so it just makes it a little easier when you know you feel like you’re making some progress with your team.” The Gophers opened Saturday’s game with three goals in 2:40 . Junior Hudson Fasching and sophomores Michael Brodzinski and Leon Bristedt all scored even-strength goals to put Minnesota ahead 3-0 early on. Northeastern quickly responded on a goal by junior John Stevens, but the Gophers would never lose the lead. Fasching scored his second goal of the night and third of the weekend to make the score 4-1, and Minnesota held on from there despite allowing two second-period goals in a 4-3 victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:37:02.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
