The doubters who say that Calgary could have done better with the 21st overall pick in 2012? In one ear and out the other. The draft-day comparison to Hall of Famer Joe Nieuwendyk, a Flames icon, by a member of the Calgary front office? Whatever. “I don’t really listen to it too much,’’ Jankowski says. “I just come to the rink every day and try to work my butt off, take everything that Coach (Nate) Leaman has taught me and everything I’ve learned from the camps in the summer with Calgary. Just work on getting better every day. Control what I can control and tune out everything else.’’ That philosophy has served Jankowski very well. He has shown solid if unspectacular improvement in his offensive totals over his first three years, from an 18-point season as a skinny 18-year-old straight out of a Quebec prep school to a 25-point year as a sophomore, followed by a 27-point junior season that climaxed with him being named to the Frozen Four all-tournament team as PC won the NCAA championship. Now, as a senior, this looks like it could be the year that his point total explodes. I’ve been saying it since the Friars hit the ice this fall: Jankowski is headed toward a big 2015-16 season. The 6-foot-3 centerman, who has always had very soft hands, is bigger and stronger. With increased muscle has come a more powerful skating stride. “That’s the big thing -- his strength,’’ says Leaman. “He came in as a weak freshman at 170 (pounds). The next year he played at 180, then 190, and this year he’s playing at 200, 205. That’s the difference. “He’s always had the game, but he didn’t have the strength to get to the right areas on the ice. He didn’t have the strength to hold onto pucks, to win his battles, to win his faceoffs. I think he can dominate in the traffic areas, where in the past he was getting pushed to the outside. The vision and the skill have always been there.’’ Jankowski can feel the difference. “It’s a huge change from freshman year to now. Now I can use my body to protect pucks and get to the net-front and win battles there for rebounds and second chances. It’s been a real help,’’ he said. Heading into this weekend’s two-game home series with 0-4 Ohio State, Jankowski has two goals and seven points in three games and is tied for second nationally in scoring. Page 2 of 2 - The goal he scored last Friday against Holy Cross was a good example of the strides he's made. When the Crusaders’ defense gave him room, Jankowski pounced, moving in and snapping off a 35-foot wrist shot from the middle that beat Tommy Nixon over the catching glove. “He got to that area a bunch the last two years and he wasn’t strong enough to finish that play,’’ said Leaman. “This year he’s strong enough to finish. It’s one thing to get to that area, but then you’ve got to make the play. He played phenomenal in the national tournament last year. When you play well on that stage, you build a lot of confidence.’’ Jankowski, who spent a month training with Flames prospects in Calgary over the summer and then attending Flames’ development camp, agrees that ending last season on the highest of notes was important. “Playing your best hockey at the end of the year is something you always want to do, especially in the biggest moments. I gained a lot of confidence and went into the summer working hard, then had a pretty good development camp in Calgary. I’m taking all that and using it as confidence and now I’m back and aiming to have a really good senior year,’’ Jankowski said. In addition to his regular shift – he’ll be centering Erik Foley and Trevor Mingoia on Friday -- Jankowski is on the power play and the penalty kill. He logged 22 minutes in the second Miami game, more ice time than any other forward. “He’s going to be a guy that’s relied upon night after night with our team. The best thing about Miami (where Jankowski put up five points in two games against the No. 15 RedHawks) was seeing him do it against a very good team, a very physical team. That was a very good sign,’’ said Leaman. For a player such as Jankowski, who turned 21 just three weeks ago, college hockey has been the perfect place to develop. “Major junior versus college, that’ll be a debate forever. For some people, major junior is the better option. College was definitely the right route for me and I’m really glad I chose Providence,’’ he says. If Jankowski continues his hot scoring pace, he'll put himself in the conversation for the Hobey Baker Award, which goes to college hockey’s top player. That would make the kind of noise that he probably would pay attention to. providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:30:58.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
