Utley was called safe and Tejada was injured on the play and left the game. PAUL RODRIGUEZ, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER \nNEW YORK — Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley has been suspended two playoff games by Major League Baseball for his takeout slide that broke New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada’s right leg. \nIn handing down the penalty Sunday night, Major League Baseball executive Joe Torre called it an illegal slide. Umpires ruled it a legal play Saturday night. \nTorre says after a thorough review from all angles, he concluded Utley’s slide merited a penalty. \nThere was no immediate word on whether Utley would appeal, which could keep him eligible to play Games 3 and 4 this week in New York. The best-of-five NL Division Series is tied at one apiece.
