(Rainin' Js podcast) Time To Worry About James Young? Into his second season for the Boston Celtics, James Young still hasn't rounded the corner. MassLive's Jay King and Red's Army's John Karalis discuss the youngster's lack of obvious progress. Comments \nNow entering his second season, James Young still has not turned the corner for the Boston Celtics. \nAt age 20, the wing remains the youngest player on the team. He dominated the D-League at times last season and still owns all the physical tools that made him a first-round pick. He was expected to need time to develop and really hasn't been in the NBA long. \nStill, he struggled at summer league (where he shot 27.1 percent) and hasn't shown much obvious progress when he does receive opportunities in Boston. It's fair to hope he would have shown a better understanding of how to make an impact by now. \nRight? \nI joined Red's Army's John Karalis to discuss Young's situation in our weekly podcast. Video of the chat can be found above, or the whole podcast can be found at Red's Army . \nBelow is a little footage of Young playing 1-on-1 with Evan Turner after a recent practice, if you're interested in that sort of thing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:23:57.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
