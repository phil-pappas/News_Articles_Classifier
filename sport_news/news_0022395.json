The Colts (3-2) host defending Super Bowl champion New England (4-0) on Sunday night. \nLuck says he is hopeful to play against the Patriots after missing the last two games — at Houston last Thursday and Jacksonville last Sunday. \nLuck wouldn't go into detail about what exactly he did in practice and Colts coach Chuck Pagano didn't reveal much either.
