Rod Blagojevich's shakedown for a campaign contribution.\nBoth tracks have hired a broker to sell the properties.\nMaywood will continue to operate simulcast racing until at least the end of the year.\nThe casinos alleged Blagojevich signed a 2008 three-year extension of a 3 percent casino impact fee for Balmoral, Maywood, Arlington International Racecourse and Hawthorne Race Course after seeking a $100,000 campaign contribution from Balmoral President John Johnston.\nAt this week's Illinois Racing Board hearings Balmoral sought to race Friday and Saturday nights next year from Jan. 4 through Nov. 3 and Maywood on the same nights from Nov. 4 through Dec. 31.\nBoth requests were denied.\nGiven Balmoral and Maywood's bankruptcy status and the prospect of no live racing and simulcast revenue in 2016, members of the sister tracks' management team said this is tantamount to putting them out of business permanently.\nMaywood Park, at the corner of First Avenue and North Avenue in Melrose Park, was, according to its website, originally the home of the Cook County Fairgrounds. It was the only area racetrack devoted to standardbred, or harness, racing.\n\"It hurts to do this but I think it's the right thing we must do in the interest of keeping the sport alive (at Arlington International Racecourse and Hawthorne Race Course),\" Racing Board member Kathy Byrne said, alluding to the plunging purses that greatly diminished the quality of this summer's Arlington meeting and the steadily deteriorating financial situation at Hawthorne.\n\"It is a very difficult decision to make. It is hard to see a racetrack close.\"\nThe Racing Board returned Hawthorne to the harness racing map for the first time since 2008 next year by giving it a Jan. 6-Feb. 5 winter meeting and a May 6-Sept. 26 summer meeting, bookending its spring and fall thoroughbred meetings. During both of the harness meetings Hawthorne plans to race five nights per week.\nArlington's thoroughbred meeting will run from May 1-Sept. 29.\nAfter unsuccessfully attempting to eliminate Hawthorne's spring thoroughbred meeting for the last four years, Arlington formed an alliance with Hawthorne and they made a joint presentation to the Racing Board.\nIn return for Arlington's support, Hawthorne is giving the state's premier track a portion of the host track revenue it receives from out-of-state simulcasts to significantly bolster purses at the Arlington summer meeting.\nMilbert is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\nPrivacy Policy Joliet Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f0ebc/turbine/ct-maywood-park-balmoral-spt-1003-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T19:44:25.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
