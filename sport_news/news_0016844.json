Utah's defense performed wonderfully all night, eventually enabling the No. 4 Utes to overcome all of the issues that they created for themselves in a 34-18 victory at Rice-Eccles Stadium.\nJust like last weekend against California, the Utes were protecting a six-point lead midway through the fourth quarter. That episode turned out well for Utah, after Cal drove to the 21-yard line in the last minute and threw two incompletions. This time, Tevin Carter's fumble recovery led to Andy Phillips' field goal for a nine-point lead and the defense took care of the rest. Devontae Booker's late 62-yard run made the win look easier than it was in reality.\n  So the Ute defense has come through two weeks in a row, after giving up fourth-quarter leads in five Pac-12 games last season — including an eventual overtime loss to ASU.\nThe Utes showed more of the resolve, resilience and resourcefulness that makes them look like a remarkable team at the halfway point of the regular season. This was a game that they certainly could have lost, and would have blame themselves for giving away. The defense's consistency made the difference in Utah's sixth win of the year, with an effort that covered up a lot of uncharacteristic problems in other areas.\nSpecial-teams mistakes basically cost the Utes 15 of ASU's 18 points — via a kickoff return for a touchdown, a punt return resulting in a field goal, a safety on an attempted trick play and another field goal on ASU's possession that followed the safety. Throughout the game, right down to Cory Butler-Byrd's punctuating interception on the final play, Utah's defense was exemplary.\nThe Utes held ASU to 257 total yards, with five sacks of quarterback Mike Bercovici contributing to the Sun Devils' net total of 15 rushing yards. That explains how the Utes seized control of the Pac-12 South race and kept themselves in the College Football Playoff conversation.\nClearly, the Utes have come a long way athletically in three years. In Utah's first encounter with ASU coach Todd Graham's spread offense, the Sun Devils scored 31 points in the first half on their way to a 37-7 victory that featured 512 yards of total offense in 2012.\nWatching that game unfold, I wondered how long it would take Utah to reach a Pac-12 talent level — especially in terms of speed.\nThe Utes have caught up quickly, judging by recent results against ASU. Even though the Sun Devils kept winning the next two years, their offense was anything but overwhelming. ASU needed a fourth-quarter rally for a 20-19 victory in 2013 and relied mostly on their defense again in a 19-16 overtime win last November. So the Utes have given up a total of 56 points to ASU in the three games since that 37-point outburst.\nIn the latest adventure, ASU failed to record a first down in the first quarter, while netting 5 total yards. The Sun Devils made some progress in the second quarter, but never threatened to score. Utah took a 14-10 halftime lead, thanks to Travis Wilson's two touchdown passes.\nWilson was definitely the better quarterback in the first half, passing for 220 yards to Bercovici's 51. Those numbers were equally remarkable in their own way, considering how Wilson had thrown for a total of 178 yards in his previous two starts against ASU.\nThe Utes sacked Bercovici only once in the first half, with Hunter Dimick and Kylie Fitts combining, but they pressured him sufficiently to disrupt ASU's passing game. Jared Norris, Pasoni Tasini and Pita Taumoepenu (twice) produced sacks in the second half.\nIn the third quarter, the Utes got a break when Kody Kohl dropped a would-be touchdown pass on a trick play, with receiver Devin Lucien delivering the ball. The Sun Devils settled for a field goal, then came the bizarre play resulting in a safety for ASU's 15-14 lead. Ute returner Britain Covey was called for a forward pass in the end zone after catching the kickoff, as the Utes attempted a trick of their own. The Sun Devils added a field goal to make it 18-14.\nBut another three-and-out effort by Utah's defense, followed by a poor punt, led to Booker's 25-yard touchdown run with an option pitch for a 21-18 lead. There would be more points to come, but that TD was sufficient for this 6-0 team.\n\nkkragthorpe@sltrib.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:19:30.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
