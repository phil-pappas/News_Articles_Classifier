I think he's done that in almost every game he's played. He's been very stingy with the football and done a nice job of that, and that's why he's more mature for his age than people give him credit for.\"\n In his first two games as Utah State's starter this season, Myers helped beat Colorado State (33-18) and Fresno State (56-14) in different ways. He ran for 191 yards against the Rams — a school record for rushing yards by a quarterback. He completed 18 of 25 passes for 260 yards and one touchdown against Fresno State.\n\"… In the passing game, he was pretty accurate,\" Wells said. \"Still, there are things he can improve on. He missed on two deep balls that would have given him some big, big numbers.\"\nSky View tight end commits to USU\nHours before kicking off against Boise, the Aggies got some good news when Sky View High School tight end Bryce Mortenson decided he would attend USU.\nOn Twitter, Mortenson said, \"Proud to announce my commitment to Utah State. Always dreamt of playing Aggie football.\"\nMortenson stands 6-foot-6 and weighs 220 pounds. He is rated a three-star prospect, according to Scout.com . He has helped Sky View achieve the No. 2 spot in The Tribune's Class 5A rankings.\nGetting after Rypien\nGoing into its game against Utah State, one of Boise State's goals was doing a better job of protecting freshman quarterback Brett Rypien.\nIn last week's 41-10 Mountain West Conference victory at Colorado State, Rypien was hit six times in 65 snaps. He was sacked once.\n\"The No. 1 requirement of playing this position is toughness,\" offensive coordinator Eliah Drinkwitz told the Idaho Statesman. \"Obviously, we'd like for him not to get hit at all. But this is football and this is a contact sport.\n\"We're going to do a better job protecting him, that's going to be a focus for everybody involved, but he's going to have to do a better job moving in the pocket, sliding out of trouble. And sometimes, hey, you've got to take one.\"\nAgainst Utah State, Rypien was under pressure from the start. He fumbled twice and threw two interceptions in the first half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:14:27.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
