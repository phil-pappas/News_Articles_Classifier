(AP) - Jason Garrison scored his second goal of the game in overtime, and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 on Thursday night. \nGarrison's game-winner came on a breakaway at 2:17 of the extra session, which featured end-to-end action in the NHL's first 3-on-3 OT of the regular season. \nThe NHL moved overtime from 4-on-4 to the new setup this season. \nTampa Bay's Ben Bishop faced his second penalty shot at 1:27 into overtime and made a pad save on Scott Laughton. \nIt was the first NHL game for Philadelphia coach Dave Hakstol, who spent the past 11 seasons coaching at the University of North Dakota. Seven of his teams at North Dakota reached the NCAA Frozen Four. \nMatt Read and Brayden Schenn scored for the Flyers. R.J. Umberger had two assists. \nThe Lightning also got a goal from Ryan Callahan.
