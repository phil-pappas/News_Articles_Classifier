Comment   Will Gilbert Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 12:01 AM By Will Gilbert Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 12:01 AM Melbourne Heber Springs senior Chase Gallaway earned all-state accolades with a round of 81 as the Panthers finished fifth at the 4A state tournament – only 10 shots behind state champion Baptist Prep at Cooper’s Hawk in Melbourne. Sophomore James Bull followed closely with an 82, one shot shy of earning all-state, while junior Jordan Adkins’ round of 89 gave the Panthers a three-player total of 252. Following Baptist Prep’s top score of 242, Fountain Lake finished second at 244. Shiloh Christian (249) was third and Pocahontas finished fourth (251), one shot ahead of Heber. “It was a good year,” said Heber Coach Gaye Stark. “We won our conference for the second straight year. We played against a lot of great players this year and that made us better. “I am really happy for Chase making all-state his senior year. He has improved immensely throughout his whole career. We will definitely miss him,” added Stark. Junior Blake Eddington, who scored 94, also competed for the Panthers. Warren’s Hayden Lassiter earned medalist with a 69. Baptist Prep’s Hunter Hickingbotham scored 74 for runner-up and Waldron’s Logan Soloman finishedthird at 76. All three will represent Class 4A in the Overall Tournament this Thursday at Pleasant Valley County Club in Little Rock.

Freshman Lilly Thomas paced Heber Springs with a round of 91, sophomore Delaney Drexler followed at 100 and freshman Courtney Eddington also competed. “We have a very young team with great potential,” said Stark. “The next three years we will be looking for big things out of them.” By Will Gilbert   Will Gilbert", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:34:50.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
