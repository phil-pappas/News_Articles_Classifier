My family will come because they don't want to miss such a special match.\" \nBoth clubs come into the match with three points after both lost to Juventus. \nThe Italian champions will be looking to maintain their perfect record in Group D when they host last-place Borussia Moenchengladbach. \nHere are some things to know about Wednesday's matches: \nNO AGUERO? NO PROBLEM \nWhen Manchester City resumed Premier League action after the international break against Bournemouth on Saturday, it was without striker Sergio Aguero and influential playmaker David Silva, who had sustained injuries on international duty. \nThose two absences would be enough to derail most teams, but City routed Bournemouth 5-1. Raheem Sterling scored a first-half hat trick and Wilfried Bony, spearheading the City attack in Aguero's absence, netted twice. \nThree points on Wednesday are needed for City to get out of the group. \nSEVILLA'S STRUGGLES \nSevilla couldn't pick a more difficult moment for a trip to face the Premier League leaders. \nSevilla coach Unai Emery led the club to back-to-back Europa League trophies the past two seasons. But the Andalusian side has struggled to adjust to the departure of striker Carlos Bacca and Aleix Vidal, and Emery has yet to find a way to get the most of new arrivals like striker Fernando Llorente. \nSevilla has only two wins in eight Spanish league matches, although one was a 2-1 victory over Barcelona to avenge its loss in the UEFA Super Cup. \nLlorente has made the trip to England after missing the last four games because of a muscle injury. Midfielder Michael Krohn-Dehli also traveled after missing the last match, a 1-1 draw at Eibar. \nSOARING IN EUROPE \nJuventus is flying in the Champions League with two wins, but it's a different story on the domestic front. \nThe four-time defending champions are 14th in Serie A after winning only two of their first eight matches. \n\"Maybe we have a bit of 'performance anxiety' in the league after our slow start,\" Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci said. \"In Europe, you face teams which play openly and that allows us to bring out all our qualities, as happened against City and Sevilla. \n\"Victory on Wednesday would be an important step, but anything can happen in the Champions League. Borussia is up and running again after a difficult start and we're expecting a lively game.\" \nJuventus can once again count on the backing of a sold-out stadium. And it has an impressive European record at Juventus Stadium, where it is on a 14-match unbeaten run in UEFA competition. \nAlthough that last loss came against German opposition — Bayern Munich in April 2013 in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinals. \nINTERIM SOLUTION \nWith four consecutive Bundesliga wins under interim coach Andre Schubert, Borussia Moenchengladbach has turned around what began as a miserable season with five straight losses. \nAfter crushing Eintracht 5-1 in Frankfurt, 'Gladbach hopes its newly regained form will also carry over to the Champions League, where the team is without points after two matches. Another loss would probably end its hopes of advancing to the knockout stage. \nMoenchengladbach was pleased with its display against Manchester City despite the 2-1 loss. \n\"We want to show that we can hold our own against the big teams as well,\" said Moenchengladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer, who is playing with a special face mask after breaking his nose. \"We have a lot of confidence at the moment and we are playing with courage and impudence, we are not easy to figure out. \n\"Everything is coming together now.\" \nAlthough Schubert has revived the team, 'Gladbach is still looking for a permanent coach. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:10:14.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
