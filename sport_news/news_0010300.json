Mitsubishi On a stand-alone basis, one could tolerate the 2016 Mitsubishi i-MiEV. With nothing to compare it to, it’s not a bad little car and there is the added appeal that it runs on electricity.\nThat was the case when it was introduced in 2012. Its only competition was the Nissan Leaf, but so much has changed in the electric vehicle universe since then. Unfortunately, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV has stood still and is being outpaced by the competition.\nRelated Links A lot of Teslas just became semi-autonomous overnight 400,000 SUVs recalled because they can roll away when parked Mercedes-Benz made a bunch of kids miserable with toy cars that won’t crash Mitsubishi points out the i-MiEV is the least expensive electric vehicle on the road with a starting price of $22,995 (before an $850 destination charge). The company also cites the $7,500 federal tax credit. Massachusetts has a $2,500 rebate available. You need to talk to a tax professional, though, to understand how the tax credit and rebate work.\nIt’s the price of the batteries that turn what is basically a $12,000 vehicle into one with a price tag of $23,000. The Mitsubishi i-MiEV just feels cheap with doors that seem to have the heft of cat food cans and an interior filled with hard plastic surfaces. Mitsubishi might have been smart to not seek the “lowest priced EV” title and instead funneled additional upscale materials into this car even if it meant a higher MSRP.\nOther sedans like the electric Ford Focus, Volkswagen eGolf, and the Nissan Leaf cost more yet are substantially nicer inside. They also get additional range, which justifies their higher prices.\nStory continues after gallery.\n10 fuel-friendly luxury cars:\n If you’re looking for an eco-friendly set of wheels, but want a car with a little more style than a Toyota Prius or a Chevy Volt, there are plenty of options. Kelley Blue Book has compiled its list of “10 Most Fuel-Efficient Luxury Cars of 2015” based on EPA ratings. These luxury cars offer impressive fuel economies and come in a wide range of prices. Check out the most luxurious fuel-friendly cars of 2015 and the pros and cons of each. Carlos Osorio/AP Photo 2016 Audi A3 TDI. Audi’s latest model is diesel-powered and features adaptive cruise control and an impressive sound system. The 2.0-liter, four-cylinder, diesel-powered engine gets 150 horsepower. It gets 31 miles per gallon city and 43 mpg highway for a combined fuel economy of 36 mpg. The base MSRP of a 2015 Audi A3 ranges from $29,900 to $41,100 according to Consumer Reports. Courtesy of Audi 2015 BMW 328d. The diesel version of BMW’s 328 gets a better fuel economy than its gasoline counterpart with 32 mpg city and 45 mpg highway. The 328d has all-wheel drive and gets 181 horsepower from its 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine. Consumer Reports liked the 328d’s agile handling but complained the diesel clatters a little. The base MSRP ranges from $32,950 to $62,000. Chris Tedesco/Courtesy of BMW Group 2015 Lexus ES 300h. According to KBB, the hybrid version of the Lexus ES offers 40 mpg city and 39 mpg highway for a combined fuel economy of 40 mpg and a range of 700 miles. Consumer Reports likes the smooth ride and reliability but complained the car is not engaging and has a troublesome control system. The base MSRP ranges from $37,700 to $40,580. William Griffith 2016 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid. KBB points out the starting price of the hybrid MKZ is the same as the gasoline alternative, giving it one of the best values on this list. The MKZ hybrid gets 41 mpg city and 39 mpg highway for a combined fuel economy of 40 mpg. KBB praised the MKZ for its spacious leather cabin while CR liked its enjoyable ride. However, CR noted the interior isn’t as spacious as other luxury sedans. The base MSRP ranges from $35,190 to $37,080. AP Photo 2015 Lexus CT 200h. The Lexus CT 200h has the same powertrain as the Toyota Prius. According to KBB, it gets 43 mpg city and 40 mpg highway for a combined fuel economy of 42 mpg. Consumer Reports likes its reliability but found the interior tight, the view from the rear camera limited, and the handling stiff. The base MSRP is $32,200. David Dewhurst Photography 2015 BMW i8. According to KBB, this all-electric car gets a combined fuel economy of 76 mpg for the first 15 miles and 28 mpge for the next 315 miles. It has very impressive horsepower of 228 from its 3-cylinder, 1.5-litre turbo engine. It can go from zero to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. The base MSRP starts at $136,500. Courtesy of BMW Group 2014 Cadillac ELR. The ELR has the same electric/gas system as its cousin the Chevrolet Volt. According to KBB, it can travel up to 37 miles on electricity alone for a fuel economy of 82 mpg. Over the next 303 miles it gets 33 mpg. KBB points out there is no ELR for 2015, but the 2016 version will have a more powerful drivetrain. The base MSRP is $75,995. General Motors 2015 Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive. KBB points out the electric B-Class offers the luxury Mercedes-Benz is known for and a combined fuel economy of 84 mpge. However, it only has a range of 87 miles. The electric motor gets 177 horsepower and a base MSRP of $41,450. Courtesy of Mercedes-Benz 2015 Tesla Model S. KBB points out the all-wheel drive 70D is the most fuel-efficient of the five Tesla models available. This version gets a fuel economy of 101 mpge city and 102 mpge highway for a combined 101 mpge. The 70D can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds and has a top speed of 140 mph. The interior includes a large 17-inch touch screen. CR called it one of the quietest rides but points out the Tesla’s impressive range drops during cold weather, which makes planning recharging stops essential. It’s also expensive with a base MSRP that ranges from $75,000 to $105,000. AP Photo 2015 BMW i3. This is the second year in a row the BMW i3 has topped KBB’s list. KBB calls the BMW i3 “the most fuel-efficient car, period.” It gets 137 mpge city, 111 mpge highway, for a combined fuel economy of 124 mpge. CR loves the i3’s fuel efficiency and calls it fun to drive. It is eligible for generous tax breaks. But CR also points out the i3’s unique look makes it kind of an eyesore and a limited range. The base MSRP ranges from $42,400 to $46,250. For those interested in the numbers, the lithium-ion main drive battery pack consists of 88 individual battery cells. Its total energy storage capacity is 16 kWh. The EPA says it has a range of 62 miles. In my week with the car, the meter consistently showed 72 miles and I observed mile-per-mile equal to the meter.\nMy wife drove the Mitsubishi to work and back, a distance of about 46 miles round trip. It went out with a full charge and came back with about 27 miles left. She sacrificed air conditioning only because we weren’t sure if she could use it and make it home. It turned out to be an unjustified concern.\nCharging was at first confusing because the Mitsubishi i-MiEV has ports on both sides of the car. One side is for the more traditional charging offered at a home through either your standard household outlet or a more powerful home charging station. The other is for high-speed charging.\nThe standard outlet will bring the car to full charge in 14 hours, but you would have to be way down in juice to need that long. A Level 2 charging station will get the job done in 7 hours. A high-speed charger can bring the i-MiEV up to 80 percent charge in less than 30 minutes.\nOnce on the road, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV drives pleasantly enough. It has three drive modes. D provides the highest performance. Eco gets you the most bang for your charge while B helps you recharge your batteries through regenerative braking. B is best used when you are braking frequently. On the highway, you need to be in D to stand any chance of changing lanes. The 0-60 time for the Mitsubishi i-MiEV is in the 13-15 second range.\nAs mentioned, the interior of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV leaves a lot to be desired but is not without some redeeming touches. The diamond patterned seats are nice looking and the center stack is easy to use. The HVAC vents and door handles are well designed.\nINTERIOR DISAPPOINTS: The instrument panel should have more emphasis on miles remaining in the charge, instead of using a fuel gauge that is largely ineffective. Mitsubishi One flaw is the instrument gauges. Too much space is devoted to a faux fuel gauge that shows remaining charge. Because the miles-left gauge is what people are going to rely on, it should be more prominent.\nThe model we drove had the optional navigation package for $2,000. It includes a seven-inch screen and navigation package, hands-free link system with Bluetooth, USB, redundant steering wheel controls, and rearview camera system.\nWithout the nav package, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV is lacking in technology beyond the heated seats. For conservation reasons, heated seats are a must-have in any electric vehicle. They help reduce the need for energy-draining heating that warms the entire cabin, even when the driver is solo.\nThe Mitsubishi i-MiEV, while loaded with airbags, gets only four stars overall from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Its side crash rating is three stars. Those scores need to be higher in a subcompact car.\n2016 Mitsubishi i-MiEV\nTHE BASICS\nPrice, base (with destination): $23,845. Fuel economy (equivalent): 126 city/99 highway/112 combined. Drivetrain: Single-speed transmission electric vehicle. Body: Four-door subcompact.\nTHE SPECIFICS\nHorsepower: 66 hp @ 3,000 to 6,000 rpm. Torque: 145 @ 0 to 3,000 rpm. Overall length: 144.7 in. Wheelbase: 100.4 in. Height: 63.6 in. Width: 62.4 in. Curb weight: 2,579 lbs.\nTHE GOOD\nThe Mitsubishi i-MiEV is the lowest priced electric vehicle in the U.S., which makes it a good way to explore an alternative fuel vehicle lifestyle.\nTHE BAD\nThe Mitsubishi i-MiEV feels too unsubstantial as a car to be a viable choice as an electric vehicle. It has a cramped interior, an awkward design, and a power deficit not overcome by instant torque.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nThe 2016 Mitsubishi i-MiEV suffers from being so far behind the competition in a growing electric vehicle field. About the only compelling reason to buy one would be price alone.\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement", "external_links": ["http://p.o0bc.com/rf/image_700w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/10/15/Boston.com/BCOM/Images/10.17.2016_Mitsubishi_iMiEV.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:06:39.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
