They sat below the red line and were simply fighting to move back into playoff position.\n\"Three games ago, these guys were under pressure,\" Porter said. \"We were being questioned and for good reason. We weren't getting the job done, but the players answered the call.\"\nTimbers tifo goes South Park The Timbers Army unveiled a \"South Park\" themed tifo before kickoff of Sunday's regular-season finale against the Colorado Rapids at Providence Park.\nAfter beating Real Salt Lake 1-0 in a hard-fought game on the road and upsetting the Los Angeles Galaxy with a dominant 5-2 win at StubHub Center , the Timbers entered Sunday's game in fourth place in the West, needing just a win or a tie against the bottom-dwelling Rapids to clinch a playoff berth.\nAll ten Western Conference teams played at the same time Sunday as part of MLS \"Decision Day\" and the Timbers entered the game capable of finishing anywhere from second to seventh place in the the standings, depending on results.\n\"We got the job done in the last three games,\" Timbers defender Jorge Villafana said. \"It was hard. It wasn't easy, but now we have to prepare for the next game.\"\nThe Timbers should feel very confident heading into playoffs.\nDespite struggling to score goals for much of the 2015 season, Portland's offense clicked in October and the Timbers closed out the season with a whopping 10 goals over their final three matches.\n\"When you look at the playoffs, you want to be in a situation where you are bringing momentum with you,\" Timbers defender Nat Borchers said. \"We have a lot of swagger right now and that's good.\"\nWith playmaker Diego Valeri serving a one-game suspension for yellow card accumulation, Darlington Nagbe took control of the offense Sunday.\nNagbe, who scored just one goal in 2014 and entered Sunday's game with just three goals this season, recorded a brace to lead the Timbers to the win.\nNagbe opened the scoring in the fifth minute, sending a beautiful free kick over Colorado's wall and into the back of the net to give Portland the 1-0 lead.\nAfter Colorado midfielder Dominique Badji scored the equalizer in the 13th minute off a shot that deflected off Timbers defender Liam Ridgewell and into the net, Nagbe once again stepped up for the Timbers. Nagbe got on the end of a cross from Lucas Melano in the 33rd minute and sent a beautifully placed header into the corner of the net as Portland retook the lead.\n\"(Nagbe's) taking ownership,\" Porter said. \"He's stepped up. He's not waiting for things to happen, he's making them happen himself. That's what makes him scary, when he plays like that.\"\nThe Timbers put the game out of reach in the second half. Jorge Villafana's shot in the 63rd minute deflected off a Rapids defender and into the net. Timbers forward Fanendo Adi then scored his 16th goal of the season in the 88th minute to give Portland the 4-1 lead.\nIn each of the last three games, the Timbers have played under extreme pressure and have risen to the occasion in each game.\nAs they head into playoffs and Thursday's knockout game, the club feels like it is peaking at the right time.\n\"With the way the guys are playing right now, I wouldn't bet against them,\" Porter said.\n-- Jamie Goldberg | jgoldberg@oregonian.com\n503-853-3761 | @ jamiebgoldberg", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamiebgoldberg"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:41:27.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
