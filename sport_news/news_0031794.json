It appeared that the airplane was taking off but encountered some kind of trouble and tried return, according to an FAA spokesperson. When emergency responders reached the scene, the plane was fully engulfed in flames.\n“ We do have a station on the airport, it responded right away, it did confirm we had a plane down that was engulfed in fire at the time, our units arrived on scene and started putting the fire out as they were responding ,” John Thomas, the Hammond Fire Chief, said.\nThomas said it was unclear if the pilot attempted to call for help.\n“T he airport tower was aware of the situation, I can't confirm if it was by radi o or by line of sight, but I'm sure [the plane] was capable of radio , but whether there was anything transmitted, we don't know ,” Thomas said.\nThe identities of the victims have not been released.\nOfficials would not release details about the plane's origin or destination. The Federal Aviation Administration is handling the investigation and will release more information Thursday.\nThe NTSB and a representative from Cessna’s engine manufacturer are expected on the scene Thursday to try and determine what happened before the crash.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
