Martin Perez will start for Texas against Marco Estrada. \nAlberto, only in the lineup because star third baseman Adrian Beltre was out with a strained back, made an error that led to Toronto's first run. He delivered an RBI single with two outs in the 14th, and Delino DeShields followed with an infield hit for another run. \nTexas shut out the highest-scoring team in the majors after the fifth inning. The victory made road teams 5-0 in the postseason so far. \nKeone Kela (1-0) worked one inning for the win, staying calm after a dust-up with Toronto slugger Josh Donaldson. Ross Ohlendorf, with an old-school, double-armed windup, finished for a first save. LaTroy Hawkins (0-1) took the loss. \nNLDS-CUBS-CARDINALS \nLackey dominates, Cardinals beat Cubs 4-0 in NLDS opener \nST. LOUIS (AP) - John Lackey outpitched old teammate Jon Lester, allowing two hits into the eighth inning, and rookies Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty each homered late as the St. Louis Cardinals cooled off the Chicago Cubs with a 4-0 victory Friday night in the opener of their NL Division Series. \nIn front of a standing room only crowd of 47,830 - the second-largest at 10-year-old Busch Stadium - thousands of Cubs faithful mixed into the red throng for the first postseason game between the two long-time rivals. \nGame 2 of the best-of-five series is Saturday. The Cardinals turn to lefty Jaime Garcia (10-6), who made 20 starts coming off risky thoracic surgery. Kyle Hendricks (8-7) makes his postseason debut for the NL wild-card winners. \nMatt Holliday had an RBI single in the first, giving St. Louis a lead after just three at-bats. Pinch-hitting, Pham homered off Lester and Piscotty had a two-run shot off Pedro Strop in the eighth. \nBC--CAR--NASCAR-CHARLOTTE-FINAL PRACTICE \nKyle Busch to start in front row at Charlotte Motor Speedway Saturday \nCONCORD, N.C. (AP) - Kyle Busch was the fastest Friday night in the final practice for the NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. \nBusch, who will start on the front row Saturday night alongside Matt Kenseth, turned a lap 189.354 miles per hour. \nChase drivers had the six fastest times. \nKurt Busch was second, followed by Joey Logano, Ryan Newman, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Brad Keselowski. \nDefending race winner Kevin Harvick was 12th, while Kenseth was the slowest of the Chase drivers with the 25th fastest lap. \nJeff Gordon struggled again in practice at a track he typically runs well at, finishing 16th. \nThe winner Saturday night will automatically qualify for the next round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.
