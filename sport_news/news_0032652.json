Sponsored Links ATASCOSA COUNTY, TEXAS â€” \nIt's said that you can't ever go back and do it all over, but one sheriff's deputy in Texas managed one more magic moment with his high school band. GM recalls SUVs, tells owners not to use windshield wipers \nAtacosa County Sheriff Deputy AJ Mendez travels with the Poteet High School marching band as security. The band director asked him to join in on a cadence with the drum line and Mendez couldn't resist. He's a 2005 graduate of Poteet and used to play in the drum line-- in fact, he and his friend created a cadence still used by the school. Mendez started coaching up the current drum line and showed them some new moves. Drum captain Patrick Gonzales said that they were getting so much of the crowd's attention that the football teams stopped playing so they could watch too. Mendez was thankful for the honor to play with the band again and when the Sheriff's Office posted the video it went viral.
