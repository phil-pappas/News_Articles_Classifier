China's Lin Xi Yu and Australia's Alison Lee took the first round lead at the rain interupted 2015 Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia golf championship, in Kuala Lumpur today. \nBoth players scored an identical six-under-par 65 at the par-71 East Course of the Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club in Bukit Kiara. \nPlay was halted for three hours due to lightning and heavy rain before it was resumed at 4.30pm. \nFor Alison, who had just completed her 17th hole before flashes of lightning broke out, the three-hour break helped her to overcome the hot and humid weather. \n\"After the rain delay, my memory just swipped clear. But I would say I was playing really well. I did make one bogey on 17...I missed a shot par putt coming in. \n\"It was all a blur. It was really hot out there today and I was just trying to stay awake,\" said the LPGA rookie. \nHowever, early starter Xi Yu escaped the weather disrupted play. \n\"On the 18th, I pulled my driver but it was lucky the ball stayed on course...but it still was a not very good lie. I had a really good second shot on the green. \n\"I guess I was a little too aggressive trying to make another birdie,\" said the 19-year-old from Guangzhou, China. \nFour players including defending champion, Feng Shanshan are trailing the joint leaders by just one stroke. \nThe others are Tseng Yani (Taiwan), Michelle Wie (United States) and Choi Chella (South Korea). \n\"Overall I think I did pretty well today (with) five-under. I am really happy that I didn't have too much pressure during the round. I still brought out my A Game. Still three more days to go,\" said Shanshan about her game. \nShanshan, who teed off from the first tee-box, shot four birdies on her first-nine and added another two birdies in her second-nine. \nHer only blemish of the day came on the 18th hole when she dropped a bogey. – Bernama, October 8,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:06:49.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
