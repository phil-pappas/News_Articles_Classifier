As players we do want that, but we also have four Slams a year,\" she told AFP in interview at the China Open in Beijing.\n\"So it's not like a lot of other sports where they get one opportunity every four years — we kind of get opportunities every four months.\n\"So it would be amazing, it would feel like probably I've won everything then if I win that Olympic medal. But if I don't, I'm not going to kill myself. I mean life\ngoes on.\"\nIndia's Olympic successes have been few and far between, with only one non-team gold medal so far at any of the Summer Games — going to bespectacled shooter Abhinav Bindra at Beijing 2008.\nExpectations at Rio \nVictory in Rio would push India's Sania mania to fever pitch, but the player herself did her best to dampen growing expectations.\n\"People kind of expect that if you don't have that medal, you're depressed. It's not like that,\" she said. \"The last time, I remember we played the Olympics and before people left the Olympic village we were already competing in another tournament. That's how a tennis player's life really is.\n\"It would be amazing to win a medal and I'll do whatever I can, but if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:35:27.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
