With Daniel’s injury we have to take it day by day, and see if he’s better,” Klopp told a news conference yesterday. \n“If he can train tomorrow completely normal, then he’s an option. Because the break is not too long, then maybe not as a starter, but he’s an option. We have to wait for this.” \nThe euphoria of Klopp’s arrival has been tempered by two draws. Last weekend’s 0-0 stalemate at Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League was followed by a 1-1 draw at home in the Europa League against Russian side Rubin Kazan. \nIt is not quite the start that Klopp, or Liverpool fans, would have hoped for. “In my first season in Dortmund we had 15 draws, if you want it’s a half win! You don’t lose. We have to get more stable,” the former Borussia Dortmund manager said. \n“I didn’t expect we would run through the league from the moment I started. This league is too strong. \n“But I have seen many things, I’m not sure what was there before but I saw many (good) things. My job is to give the team some ideas in the box.” \nWhile Sturridge is a major doubt, the return to fitness of Christian Benteke and Roberto Firmino has given Klopp more attacking options for the visit of Southampton. They both came off the bench in the second half against Kazan and could play as a partnership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:57:53.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
