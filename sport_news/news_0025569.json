He’ll face Texas lefty Cole Hamels.\nAfter losing the first two games at home, then bouncing back in Game 3 on Sunday night, the Blue Jays routed the Rangers in Texas. Toronto started knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, the 2012 NL Cy Young winner, and replaced him during the fifth inning with hard-throwing left-hander David Price, who won the AL award in 2012.\nNow Stroman, who spent most of the summer rehabbing his knee at Duke University while also finishing up his degree, will try to pitch the Blue Jays into their first AL Championship Series since 1993, when Toronto won the second of back-to-back World Series titles.\n\"I’m just so excited for this opportunity,\" the 24-year-old righty said Tuesday as the Blue Jays held an optional workout. \"Those dog days at Duke when it’s kind of tough to get through a workout with the knee pain, that’s what you kind of have in the back of your mind to keep you going.\"\n\"Obviously, it’s a perfect situation that kind of played out in my head, and it’s happening. I get the chills just thinking about being in the position that I am now,\" he said.\nBlue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos sat in the back row of the press conference room Tuesday and listened as Gibbons and Stroman addressed the media. Speaking in the hallway afterward, Anthopoulos acknowledged it was quite a setback when Stroman first suffered his injury.\n\"I might yell a little bit, but I don’t throw stuff and bang walls,\" Anthopoulos said. \"I just got in the car and drove for a little bit.\"\nBy July, as he continued to receive positive updates on Stroman’s recovery, the Blue Jays GM started to believe a comeback was likely.\n\"We factored it in when we were looking to acquire starters,\" Anthopoulos said, \"but you had no assurances and no guarantees. Even when he got injured we knew there was a chance, you just don’t want to count on it.\"\nThe Rangers also hope to have four-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner Adrian Beltre in the lineup again today The slugger left Game 1 with a strained back but returned with two hits in Game 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:17:12.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
