(Photo by Jeff Zelevansky/NASCAR via Getty Images) NASCAR has issued warnings to multiple Sprint Cup Series teams for irregularities in the inspection line last weekend at Dover International Speedway.\nThe teams of Stewart-Haas Racing teammates Kurt Busch and Tony Stewart were both handed written warnings for discrepancies with the rear bumper tubing round on their cars in pre-race inspection.\nAdChoices Busch is a Chase a driver while Stewart, the co-owner of SHR, is not.\nNASCAR also issued written warnings to the Sprint Cup Series teams of Martin Truex Jr., Trevor Bayne, Jeb Burton and Michael Annett for failing NASCAR's LASER Inspection Platform too many times in pre-race inspection. The warning against Truex's Chase-contending team came the same day that NASCAR placed the driver's crew chief, Cole Pearn, on probation through Dec. 31 for an infraction that occurred just prior to the race at Dover.\nMeanwhile, the teams of SHR driver and Dover winner Kevin Harvick and driver Michael McDowell will be held 15 minutes of practice this weekend at Charlotte Motor Speedway for infractions on previous race weekends.\nHarvick, the reigning Sprint Cup champion, is being held after his team was hit with two warnings for failing to pass NASCAR's LASER Inspection Platform three times in pre-qualifying inspection and twice in pre-race inspection at New Hampshire two weekends ago.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:34:49.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
