Friday night’s wind-blown 28-6 dismissal of Union-Endicott snipped the Tigers’ 10-game win streak in this series, leaving Vestal \na 4-2 record to its Division II football rival’s 1-5. \nThe home team built a two-TD halftime advantage — as the Bears did last season versus U-E — but this time not only protected that, but added to it in a jiffy. Twelve seconds into third-quarter play, Derek Osman was crossing the goal line to complete an 86-yard kickoff return. Richard Gleason’s PAT kick made it 21-0. \nSenior quarterback T.J. Wegmann rushed for 66 yards and a score, and passed for 80 and another. And what a gem that TD pass to Rusty Virkler was with a couple minutes remaining. And the Bears did the neighborly thing on their final possession, instructing Wegmann to thrice drop to a knee inside the Tigers’ 10-yard line.

So they bit down on it, I got some big blocks on the outside— just an awesome feeling.” \nThe lead blossomed to 14-0 two plays after a bold decision blew up in the Tigers’ paws. \nOn fourth-and-2 from its 39-yard line with 2:18 to play until halftime, U-E sent Jon Hoyt between the tackles in search of the necessary yardage, but the Bears whacked him at the line of scrimmage. \nVestal’s Sam Bulman picked up 9 yards on the next snap, and then the remaining 30 on a blast through the middle into a sizable chasm in U-E’s defense. Gleason’s PAT made it 14-0. \n“We hadn’t stopped them. They were moving the ball the whole time, getting a little bit here and there,” Anderson said of U-E’s ill-fated fourth-down decision. “I told the guys at the time, they’re going to go for it, I expected them to.” \nAnd so, Vestal blitzed aggressively, took over the football — and a couple plays later, the ballgame. \nIndeed the Tigers had left some prints in Vestal territory. \nU-E’s opening possession went for 51 yards to the hosts’ 7 before a 24-yard field goal try was off the mark, and their second again got into Vestal ground before an errant pitch led to a lost fumble. \nIn the third quarter, the Tigers advanced 72 yards on 14 plays to Vestal’s 8-yard line, only to have Chris Wright’s fourth-and-5 rush be snuffed out a yard shy of conversion. \nWright was a busy young man, playing part-time at quarterback — with an emphasis on rushing from shotgun formation — and part-time at running back when Anthony Diorio shouted instructions. That pair accounted for U-E’s touchdown on a 2-yard pass with 6:48 remaining in the game. \nOh, about that Wegmann-to-Virkler beauty. \nOn fourth-and-8 from U-E’s 28, Wegmann accepted the snap and drifted to his left, surveyed, stopped, jumped and lofted a ball to Virkler in space aplenty just across the 10-yard line. Virkler continued unmolested across for the score. \nAnd, yes, the QB shared, it was improvisation from the get-go rather than some rip-off Florida game film when Tebow was at the controls. \nThe Golden Bears will bring a 1-1 Division II record into its game next weekend against Johnson City. Union-Endicott, 0-2 in division, visits Maine-Endwell. 7 CONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1LmYOiX TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:21:07.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
