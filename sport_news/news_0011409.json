His second goal was the game-winner in a 4-2 win over the Jets at the MTS Centre.\nThe win was the Blues' fourth in a row and they are now 4-1 on a six-game road trip that will wrap up Tuesday in Montreal.\nThe visitors put up a season-high 41 shots on goal to Winnipeg's 29, of which goaltender Brian Elliott made 27 saves for his fourth win of the season.\nIn the Blues' first game without Paul Stastny, the league's fifth-ranked offense (3.4 goals per game) picked up two goals by Tarasenko and one apiece from Scottie Upshall and Carl Gunnarsson.\nThe game was tied 2-2 entering the third period and the Blues went down a man a minute into the period when Troy Brouwer was elbowed in the head by Winnipeg's Jacob Trouba. No penalty was called, as Brouwer headed to the locker room for an evaluation.\nBrouwer returned to game that was still knotted with 11 1/2 minutes remaining in regulation and took a seat on the bench.\nIn game that witnessed 13 minor penalties, the Blues were about to go another power play a minute later, but they held position and brought an extra attacker on the ice during the delayed penalty.\nThe Blues whizzed the puck around in the offensive zone, with Scott Gomez making a heads-up pass to get the puck on the stick of Tarasenko. He sized up his fifth shot of the game from the top of the circle, sent it screaming past Winnipeg goalie Ondrej Pavelec for his fifth goal of the season with 10 minutes, 10 seconds remaining in regulation.\nThe game grew testy late when Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien leveled Jay Bouwmeester, drawing a crowd of players in the corner. Byfuglien was whistled for charging and roughing, putting the Blues on their sixth and final power play.\nGunnarsson converted on the man-advantage, redirecting a shot by Colton Parayko with 1:07 remaining, for the two-goal cushion that the Blues needed down the stretch.\nThe Blues deserved plenty of credit for a victory that came in their third game in a span of 3 1/2 days in a tough environment. But Sunday's game night not have still been a game in the third period if not for some undisciplined penalties.\nThe Blues' PK had nullified all 10 power plays in back-to-back victories against Edmonton and Vancouver and with the close-decision wins over both of those clubs, the special-teams unit made the difference.\nHeading to Winnipeg on Sunday, the Blues could ill-afford to continue putting their PK to the test, but they did, and they paid for it.\nThe Jets had six opportunities on the man-advantage through the opening two periods and scored on two of them, tying the game twice after the Blues had jumped ahead.\nThe Blues were outshot 6-0 in the early going, but weathered the storm with a scoreless first period. Kyle Brodziak made a bid to put the Blues ahead with under a minute to go in the period, but a goal that would have been his 100th in the NHL was denied by an outstanding glove save by Winnipeg goalie Ondrej Pavelec.\nBut the Blues struck in the second period, and once again it was Tarasenko.\nDmitrij Jaskin, who was pointless this season before Sunday, dropped the puck back to Tarasenko, who slid through the slot and looked for his shot. Before Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien could realize what was happening, Tarasenko ripped one past Pavelec for a 1-0 lead just 3:27 into the period.\nTarasenko's fourth goal of the season gave him at least one point in all six games this season. He has four goals and four assists.\nBut the Blues' fourth penalty of the game allowed Winnipeg back in.\nScottie Upshall was whistled for high-sticking just 4:15 into the period, and just 16 seconds later Mathieu Perreault netted the Jets' first goal.\nBlake Wheeler, a noted Blues' killer, found Perreault with a back-door pass, and Perreault had a wide-open net to beat Brian Elliott for a 1-1 score.\nWith Paul Stastny out of the lineup Sunday, missing his first game with a lower-body injury, the Blues were forced to find some new line combinations.\nOne of those lines features Scott Gomez, who made his Blues' debut on Friday, centering Jaskin and Upshall. All three contributed on the Blues' second goal of the game Sunday.\nGomez provided the steal in neutral zone that led to a shot by Jaskin. That was turned away, but Jaskin grabbed the loose puck and flicked it past Pavelec to the front of the net, where Upshall was standing and ready to knock it across the goal line.\nBut with 7:33 left in the second period, Winnipeg struck on the power play again, with Drew Stafford deflecting a shot by Nikolaj Ehlers for a 2-2 score.\nIt stayed that way until the third, when once again Tarasenko led the Blues to victory.\n(c)2015 St. Louis Post-Dispatch\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1739827&h=Blues+win+fourth+straight+game+in+Winnipeg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1739827&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1739827"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:38:45.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
