Fenninger was transported by helicopter to a clinic in nearby Innsbruck earlier Wednesday, three days before the World Cup season starts with the traditional GS on the Rettenbach glacier. \nFenninger, who is the GS world champion, won the race last year, sharing victory with Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:50:40.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
