Related Links The full story: Mathew Ajibade case timeline By Jan Skutch Mathew Ajibade was “pretty much defenseless” after he was strapped into a restraining chair at the Chatham County jail on Jan. 1, a deputy on the scene testified Friday.\n“I didn’t know the Taser was used,” former deputy Eric Vinson told a Chatham County Superior Court jury hearing the case against three former jail employees charged in Ajiade’s death.\nTestimony has shown that Abijade resisted deputies’ instructions shortly after he was taken to the jail on Jan. 1 and he was taken to the floor in an attempt to control him.\nDuring an ensuing scuffle which injures two deputies, Lt. Debra Johnson ordered him put in a restraining chair and he was taken to a pre-booking holding cell where then-Cpl. Jason Kenny, the ranking officer, used a stun gun on the restrained inmate.\nAjibade died in the restraining chair, a spit mask covering his face, sometime before 1:38 a.m. on Jan. 2 after jail staff failed to monitor him for an hour and a half.\nEvidence showed that Kenny was not originally assigned to the pre-booking area on Jan. 1 but moved there after Sgt. Anza Rowland was disabled in the scuffle with Ajibade.\nDeputy Cpl. Maxine Evans then assumed Rowland’s duties as the next ranking deputy.\nAlso Friday, Deputy David Cody testified he helped restrain Ajibade, telling jurors Ajibade was saying, “I’m going to die, I’m going to die,’” as deputies strapped him in into a restraining chair in holding cell 4.\nCody said Kenny had a Taser with him in the room as Ajibade was fully restrained in the chair, but questioned if a Taser was needed.\nCody testified that since the inmate was fully restrained, “I believe we would’ve succeeded without the Taser being used.”\n“Do you think it appropriate to Tase him at all when he’s fully restrained?” Assistant District Attorney Matt Breedon asked Cody.\n“No,” he responded.\nCody also testified that while Kenny had the Taser he had not recalled him using it.\nAjibade, 21, died in the wake of a violent confrontation with jailers after his arrest earlier on Jan. 1.\nKenny, 31, and former deputy Maxine Evans, 56, along with Gregory Brown, a 45-year-old Corizon Health licensed practical nurse at the jail, are on trial for involuntary manslaughter for causing Ajibade’s death “without any intention to do so.”\nKenny is charged with using a Taser against a restrained Ajibade. The other two are charged with reckless conduct by failing to monitor Ajibade’s status.\nIn addition, Kenny and Evans are charged in two separate indictments with committing perjury before the Chatham County grand jury that was hearing the case in what the state contends was part of an attempt to cover up their involvement in the death.\nAll three defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nJudge James F. Bass Jr. will hold court today as prosecutors attempt to catch up on witnesses.\nAlso on Friday, Vinson was asked about Evans’ testimony before the Chatham County grand jury in the case.\nWhen Assistant District Attorney Matt Breedon cited Evans’ testimony that Vinson told her that he and Deputy Mark Capers had checked on Ajibade at “approximately 12:20 a.m.” on Jan. 2, Vinson replied:\n“No sir. I was just doing the check,” Vinson replied.\n“Did she ever ask you to check at all?” Breedon asked, to which Vinson said no.\nSimilarly he denied Evan’s grand jury testimony of a similar report of a check at 12:40 a.m.\nAlso Friday, sheriff’s internal investigator Nicole Meyers told jurors that her use-of-force investigation left her with “some concerns about the use of the Taser” on Ajibade.\n“Did you see Mathew Ajibade fighting?” while in the restraining chair, Assistant District Attorney Christy Barker asked.\n“I did not,” Meyers responded.\n“Did you see Mr. Ajibade acting what you would term combative,” Barker asked.\n“No,” she replied.\nMeyers testified she heard Ajibade say, “I can’t breathe, help. I heard him cry” at about 11:50 p.m. on Jan. 1.\n“I want to say I heard him sniffle. He like whined,” about 12:35 a.m. on Jan. 2.\nAnd recently retired Lt. Robert Brooks testified his training of Corrections Emergency Response Team members was the typically a Taser is not used in putting someone in a restraint chair.\nKenny was a part of that CERT team.\nTestimony has shown that Rowland used a “drive-stun” Taser into Ajibade during the initial scuffle.\nThe method is pain compliance use which hurts but does not immobilize the person as a shot of two prongs will do.\nHe also said the limit number of shots from a Taser was three.\nIn the Ajibade situation, Brooks told jurors, “I wouldn’t have drug stunned him. I would have gone ahead and put two prongs into him.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14766969_2.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14766969_2.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14754190_4.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14754189_4.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/ajibade_3_1_0_5.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/ajibade_3_1_0_5.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14754189_4.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14754190_4.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:07:59.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
