(Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar) \nTHE DEHNER DECISION \nThis wasn’t a poor Buffalo defense. The Bills boast a scary front seven and one of the best young cornerback tandems in football. \nThe Bengals sliced and diced them in the second half to sap any drama out of Sunday afternoon at Ralph Wilson Stadium. \nSound like a theme? Outside of the win at Baltimore and last week against Seattle the first six weeks of the season have contained little drama thanks to this offense. At this point it’s fair to wonder if any defense can slow them down as long as they stay healthy. The Bills and Rex Ryan certainly couldn’t. \nTeams can’t keep up with these weapons and heading into the bye week at 6-0 with two weeks to prepare for Pittsburgh should leave the Bengals coaches kicking back with their feet up and smile on the face. Bengals now 6-0 with win over Bills \nGAME BALL: Andy Dalton \nGiving the game ball to Andy Dalton every week might feel like a cop out, but hard to deny at any point he hasn’t been worthy. Again, Dalton orchestrated the Bengals offensive circus efficiency while the Bills threw different looks around. \nDalton not only went without an interception, he checked masterfully into a run play against a Bear defense for the Giovani Bernard touchdown run and found the 6-inch height difference between Tyler Eifert and Bacarri Rambo for a third-quarter touchdown. \nSeven players caught passes, four others rushed. \nDalton finished with 22 of 43 for 243 yards. He had a passer rating of 118.6. Now he has six consecutive games with a passer rating of at least 95. He’s also topped 115 in five of his first six games. The only one lower was when leading a 17-point fourth-quarter comeback against the Seahawks. \nDANCE OF THE GAME \nJeremy Hill unveils his latest touchdown dance after a slick tiptoe of the sideline for the Bengals first touchdown of the game. \nGAME CHANGER: Marvin Jones \nAs the Bengals pushed the tempo after Buffalo stole momentum with a touchdown just before halftime, Dalton opened the first drive of the second half targeting No. 82. On a drive that covered 90 yards, four times Dalton hit Jones – two of the spectacular variety. Jones sprinted and dived after a 42-yard reception. He then put the finishing touches on the drive cutting a WR screen up-field and diving, flipping and extending the ball over the goal line. The Bills picked their poison shading coverage to take A.J. Green away and Jones made them pay. \nINJURY UPDATE \nBengals linebacker Vinny Rey went out with an ankle injury in the third quarter and had to be taken off on a cart. Rey took all but three snaps this season and was the nerve center of the defense making all the calls from linebacker. Rookie third-round pick P.J. Dawson entered in his place in the base defense. \nRey came back to the sideline with a helmet, but didn’t play another snap after the injury. \nLinebacker Vontaze Burfict will be eligible to return after the bye week, but whether he does or not is up in the air. We updated this story Friday, here are those details. Bengals notes: Burfict won't be activated on bye \nMEMORABLE MOMENT \nThe Bengals hope to see many more interceptions from 2014 first-round pick Darqueze Dennard going forward, but the first pick of his career offered a spectacular start. This marked Dennard’s third straight game with extended playing time due to injuries in the secondary. Leon Hall was inactive Sunday because of a back injury, leaving Dennard as the starter in the slot. \nTHREE KEY NUMBERS \n34: Yardage difference of average drive start during the first half. The Bengals average start was midfield and Buffalo their own 16. \n4-66: Receptions and yards for Marvin Jones on the Bengals touchdown drive to open the second half, including a 42-yard diving deep reception and WR screen with an acrobatic dive into the end zone. \n1975 and 1988: Only other time in franchise history the Bengals have been 6-0. Both teams lost their seventh games. \nPHOTO OF THE GAME \nGiovani Bernard running with a smile on his face during a touchdown run in the first half. Great shot from our guy Kareem Elgazzar. — Kareem Elgazzar (@ElgazzarBLVD) October 18, 2015 \nTHREE KEYS REVISITED \nCommunication Breakdowns in the Secondary: For a third time this season the Bengals were left looking at each other wondering what happened to a receiver left wide open. This time the touchdown came when Sammy Watkins stood alone in the end zone for three seconds as E.J. Manuel hit him with a 22-yard TD pass just before halftime. Dre Kirkpatrick, Dennard and Reggie Nelson were all around the play. \nStart Fast: Buffalo actually set the tone on the opening drive. They went 11 plays and 80 yards in 5:39 for an easy touchdown drive. The Bengals were able to recover and jump out to a 17-7 lead. They still held a three-point lead at the break, marking the fifth time in six games they led at the half. \nNeutralize the defensive line: The Bengals offensive line continued be dominant protecting the passer. On Sunday it was a quarter-billion dollar starting front four across them. Dalton wasn’t sacked and rarely ended up on his back. The Bengals have only allowed a sack in two of the first six games. \nVINE OF THE GAME \nA firsthand view of what it’s like to be a Bengals fan at Ralph Wilson Stadium as No. 94 gives it to him following the Bills first score. Oh, and what it’s like to be a kid at Ralph Wilson Stadium as he takes a body to the face. 133 CONNECT 16 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1LE5CIS TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:31:13.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
