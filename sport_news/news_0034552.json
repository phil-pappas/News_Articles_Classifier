General Manager Mike Rizzo said on a conference call last week that he will be conducting a thorough managerial search in the weeks ahead, with an emphasis on experience. \nRipken, 55, has never managed before, and he addressed that lack of experience with Eisen. \n“The baseball background I have, you’re a student of the game,” Ripken said. “There’s a lot said about experience or a lack of experience in managers coming through. To me, it’s all about your philosophy, how you handle things, what you’re going to do. And then, it’s being able to apply. I haven’t had a chance to apply that, so no one knows. That would be a risk, I suppose.” \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP. All Rights Reserved.
