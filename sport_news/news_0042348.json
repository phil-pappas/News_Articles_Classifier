Because they’re going to test us all over the field. \n“They’re going to run from deep in their half, they’re going to put up high balls. \n“They’re going to test us all around the park – tactically and technically.” \nWinger Drew Mitchell, who plays at French club Toulon, knows the talents of Imhoff and his allies well – having matched up against them in the Top 14, where Imhoff represents Racing Metro. \nHe sent out a warning to teammates that it wasn’t just out wide that Argentina have been attacking and that lazy play anywhere on the field will be punished. \n“(It’s) not just for us out wide to have to worry about containing them, it’s for our defence entirely,” Mitchell said. \n“Because they’re looking for lazy defenders and guys who might knock off on the inside and make the most of the opportunities on the inside as well. \n“They’ve shown the hand that they’re prepared to play from anywhere. \n“Some teams prefer to kick out of certain situations, these guys are more than happy to really attack, so it means there’s just no room for assumption against the Argentinians.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:42:09.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
