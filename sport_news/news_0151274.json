The two teams combined for plenty of crazy moments in a contest that contained eight turnovers -- five for the Falcons (three of which ended early drives). \nIn his second start of the season Winder quarterback Brock Landis continued his impressive play, scoring two touchdowns and putting up 195 total yards to help spark a Bulldoggs offense that was still missing standout running back Cece Green due to injury. Javonne Hughes also stepped up for Winder, rushing 27 times for 125 yards. \nLandis' first score -- on a 26-yard run in the second quarter -- made it 7-3 at halftime and his 1-yard run in the fourth quarter proved the difference in the final score. At the time, however, it looked as if Landis' touchdown iced the game -- but Flowery Branch was not about to go away. \nThe Falcons blitzed downfield on a 41-yard pass play and pulled within 24-17 on a 1-yard touchdown run from Jasen Johnson. Flowery Branch kept the Bulldoggs under pressure, forcing a fumble and a punt inside the final five minutes -- but Winder would not let go of its lead. \nTrey Wilcoxson continued his workhorse play for the Falcons offense, rushing 22 times for 110 yards. Quarterback Kory Graham completed 5 of 19 passes, including a 32-yard touchdown srtike to Johnson, though he also tossed three interceptions. \nThe Falcons will look to bounce back next week at Clarke Central. \nWinder will take a bye next week before facing Cedar Shoals on Oct. 16.
