Now the hard part begins: raising the funds to build it. And the Chatham County commission can help with that effort.\nMarine Science Center director Maria Procopio told Tybee Island city officials last week that the new building would be 5,000 square feet in size, but with an added 5,000 square feet of usable space. Now located in a former police station on the south beach near the pier, the new museum is slated for a space in the historic Fort Screven district.\nThe building, she said, would feel like a “natural space on a barrier island,” with views of the dunes and the shipping channel from three overlooks.\nThe new building would also feature an amphitheater for programs and Nana walls (bifolding doors) for expanding its classrooms.\nThe estimated cost for construction, she said, is about $2 million. Another $2 million would be needed to fund exhibits, equipment, furnishings and fixtures.\nIn an interview with the Savannah Morning News before the design phase started, Ms. Procopio outlined plans for building the new museum:\n• The new facility will be a one-story raised structure covering 5,000 square feet devoted to administrative and classroom space; a gallery showcasing exhibits of living creatures native to coastal Georgia; and an animal husbandry area. That’s a significant increase over the existing facility’s 3,000 square feet and will give the center — which hosted 44,000 paid-program participants in 2014 — the space needed to carry out its mission of teaching visitors about our state’s coastal resources.\n• To be constructed on vacant acreage on the north end of the island’s north beach parking lot that’s being leased from the city of Tybee.\n• The facility will be financed via $600,000 in already allotted Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax money, proceeds from grants and a capital fund campaign.\nOnce the facility moves to a larger space, Ms. Procopio said, the plan is to grow its programming to include coastal culture. The center would also work in conjunction with other attractions in the area like the Tybee Island Light Station and Museum, she said, “and let the south end stay the party place.”\nTo meet $2 million fund-raising goal, the museum will need some help. One suggestion floated at a workshop last week was to use funds leftover in the current SPLOST from the recent beach nourishment project. Mayor Jason Buelterman cautioned city officials that getting that money will be up to the county. So if Tybee officials opt to go for that option, they would need to get the blessing of Chatham County officials.\nTybee is a regional destination spot for all residents in the county and Southeast Georgia. We encourage the Chatham County Commission to seriously consider this funding option for the maritime center. The money is there and unless they can find a better project, this maritime center provides educational opportunities for school children, tourists and local wildlife enthusiasts. In 2014, the Coastal Georgia Gallery in the museum had 28,000 visitors. And the center had 22,000 Georgia students participate in its Sidewalk to the Sea program.\nThose are impressive numbers that could be expected to grow in a more suitable and dedicated venue.\nThese visitors came to the museum despite that fact that the two story facility is practically windowless and in no way provides the aura of a seaside facility.\nWith the county commission’s support, this museum will showcase the importance of a barrier island like Tybee to school children, tourists and local residents. That’s a large constituency. And these are important lessons.\nTYBEE MARITIME CENTER\nCounty should support fledgling maritime center\nT he design phase of the Tybee Island Maritime Center’s new facility is complete.
