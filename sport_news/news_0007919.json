I don’t think he ever shied away from the fact he wants to pitch in the postseason. We’re here now and he’s ready to take the ball when he needs it.\" \nHarvey was slotted for Game 3 of this series since he could only pitch once due to his innings restrictions, but providing an inning of relief would be similar to throwing a bullpen session. \nFellow starter Noah Syndergaard is also available in the bullpen — he and Harvey are lined up for the first two games of the NLCS if the team advances. Collins said Syndergaard could potentially be used in the seventh or eighth innings. \nOFFENSIVE SLUMBER: Several of the starters are having a rough series, including 3B David Wright, 1B Lucas Duda, and C Travis d’Arnaud. \nDuda is 2-for-15 with nine strikeouts in the series, and Collins said \"we’ve got get Lucas going.\" Wright is hitting .083 but has a .353 on-base percentage, and d’Arnaud is 3-for-16, with all three of his hits coming in Monday’s blowout victory. \n\"Our lineup, if we spread out the offense, we win games. We win a lot of games,\" Collins said. \"Right now, we’ve got to have that [tonight]. We’ve got to have one through eight for sure produce some runs for us.\" \nCONFORTO STARTS: Michael Conforto will start in left field tonight. He homered off Zack Greinke in the previous matchup. \nBRIEFS: Nationals ace Max Scherzer will join Fox’s studio show during the ALCS. … New Brewers GM David Stearns hired Rays executive Matt Arnold as VP/Assistant GM. … Cardinals C Yadier Molina, who battled a strained left thumb ligament in the playoffs, said his injury was \"pretty bad\" and was headed to visit his doctor. \nThis article contains material from The Associated Press.
