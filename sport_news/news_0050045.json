I am like most coaches, in that I feel like we left a couple matches out there that I thought we could have won. We are excited to have five out of six still in the main draw of singles. Tomorrow things are going to be much more difficult, so we need to be prepared to raise our level of play.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:55:26.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
