Coach Danny Manning said that Miller-McIntyre had surgery on the foot during the weekend, but did not specify which foot. Miller-McIntyre averaged a team-best 14.5 points last season while starting all 32 games. The senior has missed just two games during his college career — one as a freshman (at North Carolina State due to strep throat) and another as a sophomore (at Duke due to an ankle injury). He’s one of six players in the Atlantic Coast Conference who enter the approaching season with more than 1,000 career points. He led the Demon Deacons with 12.6 points per game two seasons ago as a sophomore. Wake Forest begins its season Nov. 13 against Maryland-Baltimore County. A six-week recovery would force Miller-McIntyre to miss six or seven games before returning around the start of December. Wake Forest faces Richmond on Nov. 18, then travels to Hawaii for high-profile games from Nov. 23-25 against Indiana, St. John’s or Vanderbilt and another yet-to-be-determined opponent at the Maui Invitational.
