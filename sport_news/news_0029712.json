Siegel (11-2-1) plays Stewarts Creek (6-6-3) at 8 p.m. Tuesday in the second semifinal. \nBoth semifinal winners play at 7 p.m. Thursday in the championship game. Both district finalists qualify for next week's region tournament. Heads up: Blaze soccer wear headbands to reduce injury \nOakland defeated Blackman 4-0 on Sept. 24 in their regular-season meeting. The game features Vice coaching against Jeff Boynton, whom Vice coached at Blackman. \n\"We're going to try and play with them,\" Vice said. \"Jeff has a good team. I've got a few wrinkles for Jeff. I'm not saying what they might be. I'm sure he'll figure it out.\" \nThe Lady Blaze's win came two weeks after they shut out Smyrna 1-0 to secure a home playoff game. After that game, Vice was upset with his team's inability to score goals. \nThat wasn't a problem this round. \nFreshman Jill Berosh scored off Carly Bowen's pass in the 35th minute for a 1-0 lead. It was the first of two goals for Berosh. \n\"We were connecting the ball better,\" Berosh said of the Lady Blaze's offensive success. \"We had better runs out wide that led to open crosses in the middle. That led to better finishes.\" \nKenzi Vetter scored off teammate Katelyn Davis' pass three minutes into the first half. Berosh then scored off Emily Nash's pass in the 59th minute. Carrington McKenzie ended the scoring on a quick hitter from Davis that got by goalkeeper Emily Bryant in the 62nd minute. Girls soccer, volleyball postseason schedule \nBlackman's offensive surge came after Smyrna (8-6-1) held its own in the first half and even had multiple scoring opportunities. \n\"First half we came out and it was kind of how everyone anticipated this game going,\" Smyrna coach Brian Grogan said. \"We had some really good looks at the beginning. \n\"Credit to them. They took care of every mistake we made, or every bad bounce in the back. They finished, and finished well. Other than that, it was pretty equal.\" \nThe game marked Grogan's last as the girls coach. Assistant Stephanie Goldsmith will take over as head coach of the girls next season in a move decided prior to the season. Grogan will continue to be the boys head coach. \nReach Tom Kreager at 615-278-5168 and on Twitter @Kreager. \nDistrict 7-AAA Tournament", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:32:20.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
