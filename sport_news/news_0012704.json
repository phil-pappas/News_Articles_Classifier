The Valencia-based team aims to finish the season in style with another podium and secure second spot in the championship. Fuster joins Calko and Matijoaitis at the wheel of the Ginetta-Nissan LMP3 after missing the previous round at Paul Ricard. The season finale of the 5-race European Le Mans Series will indeed be a decisive round for SVK by Speed Factory Racing. The team founded by Dalius Steponavicius will continue podium push on Portuguese soil. The Autódromo do Estoril, the home of the F.1 Portuguese Grand Prix from 1984 to 1996, hosts the final round of this year´s European Le Mans Series, which reach a dramatic climax at the final event of the year. SVK by Speed Factory Racing has achieved two podium finishes to date at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, 2nd in LMP3 class, and at the Paul Ricard HTTT, stepping 3rd onto the podium. Only bad luck prevented from delivering similar results at Silverstone and Red Bull Ring always against factory competition from Ginetta. With only one round remaining in the European Le Mans Series, SVK by Speed Factory Racing continues to place second on 45 points with its drivers Konstantin Calko and Dainius Matijoaitis also second in the drivers´ championship. The primary goal is to defend second place ahead of the pursuing experienced squads and end the season in style with another strong result. Spain´s Jesús Fuster returns to race in the European Le Mans Series, after missing the previous event in France where he was replaced by Netherlands´ Mirco van Oostrum, and will rejoin Calko and Matijoaitis behind the wheel of the Ginetta-Nissan LMP3. Saturday is devoted to two 90-minute free practice sessions at 10.30 and 15.00 (Portuguese time). On Sunday, LMP3 qualifying session takes place at 09.30 (local time) and the 4 hours of Estoril will get underway at 13.00 (local time). Dalius Steponavicius (Team manager of SVK by Speed Factory Racing): \"For us, Estoril isn´t only a race, but we want to take our best result of the season. At the beginning, our start in the series was difficult from technical side. We struggled with engine power issues at Silverstone. Then at Imola we had win in our hands, but horrible quality of headlights cost us 2 minutes in the box and we took 2nd. Red Bull Ring was the most important race of the season. Our pace was really good but sadly we return home without finish and points, as two valances broke self and Factory can´t support us with required quantity of parts. It was a decisive moment in this season, and it became clear that we can´t win the championship against Ginetta Factory team. Starting from the Paul Ricard race weekend we have switched to more conservative tactics, the same we will do in Estoril. Our race in Portugal will be very calculated and we will try to maintain our 2nd place in the championship and hope to have good time to celebrate ELMS vice champion title in LMP3 category. In parallel we already started preparation for the next season which will be very busy and wider for the team. We will announce our 2016 program during Estoril race weekend.\" Konstantin Calko (Driver of SVK by Speed Factory Racing): \"The very first time I raced at Estoril was in 2013, when I tested the Audi R8 LMS ultra. The track is really challenging with plenty of space for overtaking. We all know how important this race is for us. We are going to put in maximum effort into what´s a very difficult event and gain best possible result.\" Dainius Matijoaitis (Driver of SVK by Speed Factory Racing): I don´t know why, but it´s probably because Estoril is the last event, that I´m most worried for this one. There are so many things going on at the end of the season. We need to try our best to keep our team on the podium. Besides, different testing will kick off to prepare for the new 2016 season. So my vision of a peaceful season-ending won´t become reality. But, in the end, that is what we are here for, pure excitement!.
