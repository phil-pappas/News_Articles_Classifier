The remnants of Patricia, which was downgraded to tropical depression status and was expected to reach northern Mexico by Saturday night, may add to the rain falling in South and Central Texas, said Jesse Moore, a National Weather Service forecaster in Fort Worth.\nThe storm system already moving through Texas dumped more than a foot of rain on parts of the state on Friday, causing flooding that blocked several major roadways.\nStorms clouds move over during the second practice session for the Formula One U.S. Grand Prix auto race at the Circuit of the Americas, Friday, Oct. 23, 2015, in Austin, Texas.

Firefighters retrieved him and walked him to safety.\nA Union Pacific freight train derailed before dawn on Saturday near Corsicana, about 50 miles south of Dallas, because a creek overflowed and washed away the tracks, said Jeff DeGraff, a railroad spokesman. The two crew members swam to safety and nobody was hurt, he said.\nAdvertisement \"They (crew) escaped the train after it stopped and swam to high ground,\" DeGraff said. \"A Navarro County rescue team was able to get in and pull them to safety, they are back safe on dry ground.\"\nOne locomotive and several rail cars loaded with gravel went into the water and were partly submerged, DeGraff said. He had no specifics on how many cars derailed because crews couldn't reach the site due to flooding.\nA driver attempts to navigate through high water on Northwest Highway during a heavy rain fall Friday, Oct. 23, 2015, in Dallas.
