WEST WINDSOR – The Holy Angels tennis team “has two great singles players, but its doubles aren’t that good.”\nAngels doubles player Brooke Heideger heard these remarks plenty of times this fall, and said she did a slow burn every time.\n“It made me angry,” Heideger said. “It just made us want to go out there and beat people even more.”\nOn Thursday, Heideger and her second-doubles partner Abby Williams proved the notion complete hogwash as they recorded the clinching point in their team’s 4-1 victory over Bishop Eustace in the Non-Public A final.\nHoly Angels won its first group championship and will return to Mercer County Park on Sunday for the NJSIAA Tournament of Champions.\nThe Angels’ senior-sophomore combination of Heideger and Williams knocked off rivals Meghan Bohny and Caroline Hromy, 6-1, 6-4. The Angels were actually up 5-1 in the second set and squandered six championship points before finally ending it.\n“We definitely could’ve ended it sooner,” Heideger said with a laugh. “I guess we kind of got a little excited and lost focus. But we got ourselves together, went out there and hit our shots.”\nIn addition to its singles standouts in freshman Ashley Hess and senior Adrianne Alfonso, Holy Angels received a big point from junior Alison Kim at third singles. She topped Ashley Sorelle, 6-0, 7-5.\n“We came down here my freshman year and got beat really bad by Pingry,” Kim said. “Coming back and winning this meant a lot to all of us, especially the seniors.\n“Our team has never won groups, so for me, being part of that is really special.”\nHoly Angels’ most special talent is Hess, who fell in a surprising 0-3 whole against Caitlyn Sorelle but reeled off 12 straight games to win 6-3, 6-0. Hess’ tremendous combination of power and finesse proved too much in the end.\n“She started out really strong, and I think I was a little nervous at first,” Hess said. “But once I settled down, I was able to start controlling points. By the second set, I was back to my game.”\nAlfonso had no early jitters and clobbered rival Caitlin Deffler, 6-1, 6-0. Alfonso said moving down to second to accommodate Hess hasn’t bothered her a bit.\n“Being part of a team that’s accomplished so much, winning counties and then this … it’s plenty for me,” Alfonso said. “I’m ecstatic right now and really proud of my team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:33:34.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
