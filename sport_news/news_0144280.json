Edit: Mr Badal has to own up Punjab: SAD ‘activist’, granthi among five arrested for sacrilege Punjab: Over 100 villages boycott Akalis More stories on Punjab page In signs of government's weariness, CM Parkash Singh Badal today surmised there was \"a method behind these orchestrated incidents meant to destabilise his government\" and that law enforcement agencies were trying to find the real perpetrators. The CM, who visited the Golden Temple on Saturday a day after Akal Takht withdrew pardon to the Dera Sacha Sauda chief, admitted that the people were angry. \"However, we should not misjudge the situation as being anti-Akali-BJP,\" he hastened to add. Badal's remarks had no effect on Congress leader Capt Amarinder Singh, who prayed at the Golden Temple today and later hit out at the CM, demanding his dismissal. In the midst of protests, Akal Takht in a statement in Amritsar today asked people not to hold Akhand Path on roadsides. Reports said the Amritsar police arrested a granthi and his wife on charges of desecrating 'gutkas' and 'pothis' in a Jandiala village. The police have also formed a special investigation team to probe such instances at Najjarpur and Bath villages. A Ludhiana report said the police arrested two persons, including a baptised woman in Dehlon village for desecrating the holy book. Another man was held in Sangrur. Moga, the hotbed of protests in the Malwa region, remained on edge for the seventh day with most schools and colleges remaining closed and road blockades put up at many places at national and state highways. Reports said panchayats in 100 villages have decided to boycott Akali leaders and 'bar' politicians from entering the villages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:14:45.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
