High school football Week 7 scouting report 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Express-News staff writer Terrence Thomas sets the stage for what to watch for this weekend:\nKey storylines\nDeja vu for Lee: A week ago, the Volunteers defeated Madison for the first time since 1987. If they can snap another sizeable drought this week, if could be a big step toward them earning their first postseason berth since 1993.\nLee (5-1 overall, 1-1 District 26-6A) faces Churchill (3-2, 0-1) at 7 p.m. Saturday at Heroes Stadium. Churchill leads the all-time series 35-11-2, including 12 straight wins. Lee’s last victory in the series was a 20-17 decision in 2002.\nThis time they count: While most teams have already started pursuits for district titles and playoff berths, the area’s sub-5A districts (13-3A-I, 13-4A-II, 14-3A-II, 14-4A-I, 14-4A-II, 15-2A-II, 15-3A-I, 15-4A-I, 15-4A-II and 16-3A-II) open up league play this week.\nSaturday matinees: Have plans for Saturday evening and won’t be able to make it out to a local stadium for a high school football game? Have no fear. Your problem is solved.\nThere are two 2 p.m. games scheduled for Saturday — Burbank vs. Brackenridge in a District 28-5A contest at Alamo Stadium, and Central Catholic at St. Anthony in a TAPPS 2-I matchup.\nUnder the radar games\nSomerset at Southside: 7:30 p.m. Friday — The Cardinals won last year’s game 17-14 on Zach Henry ’s 26-yard field goal with nine seconds left. It was perhaps the defining moment in Southside’s season, catapulting it from a 1-9 showing in 2013 to an 8-3 finish in 2014.\nThis year’s game could have similar importance — Southside is 0-2 in District 29-5A and needs a win to remain in the hunt for a playoff spot.\nKerrville Tivy at Lockhart: 7:30 p.m. Friday — It will be the tortoise (Lockhart) vs. the hare (Tivy) in this matchup of unbeaten District 27-5A foes.\nTivy (5-0 overall, 3-0 district) is averaging 57.8 points and 564.6 yards — 325 passing and 239.6 rushing. Lockhart (6-0, 4-0) is averaging 45.5 points and 321.5 yards — 307.2 rushing out of its ball-control, Slot-T attack led by D.J. Ellison (1,093 rushing yards).\nBy the numbers\n7: Area players — Jefferson’s Jesse Flores (992), Wagner’s Jamaree Yelton (981), Clemens’ Frank Harris (962), Devine’s Jack Zimmerle (961), Southside’s Matthew Collier (880), MacArthur’s Dai’Jon Williams (863) and Lee’s Sammy Davis IV (770) — who could reach the 1,000-yard rushing mark this week. Davis has the largest margin to make up to reach the plateau, but he rushed for 232 yards last week against Madison.\nAntonian’s Daniel Rosenfeld (1,112) and Pearsall’s Adrian Leal (1,052) have already rushed for 1,000 yards.\ntthomas@express-news.net\nTwitter: en_terrence", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/71/13/8622819/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/60/21/8586312/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/64/8731933/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/64/8731933/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/71/13/8622819/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/13/00/8695811/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/06/8700322/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/60/21/8586312/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/53/8657617/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/53/8657617/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/13/00/8695811/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/06/8700322/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:48:40.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
