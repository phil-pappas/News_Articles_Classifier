To see our heated rival have to go through the struggle of knowing something bad happened in your program, or completely living in denial, leaves us with a tough decision. People who live out in the state without any daily interaction with Louisville fans get off easy. You have crafted an idea of what a UL fan is in your mind and nothing you see will change that opinion. But myself and thousands of others in this city don’t get that luxury. We actually work, live, and hang out with these people. Hell, most of my family are UL fans. And so I am faced with a difficult decision. Do I sympathize with people who I love and care for? Or is it my job as a UK fan to take a joy in their pain? \nYou see, there is a dirty little secret that most people reading this website will never want to admit: UL fans are not that bad. They really aren’t. You know how UK fans get this reputation for being obsessed and crazy, almost to the point of delusion? Well, the reality is that we absolutely have some of those people and they are often the loudest of our fans. But the other 95% of us are normal people with normal lives who follow and cheer for a college team. The same goes for UL. Of course they have that idiot fan who drinks Crown Royal and speaks like they are in a 90’s rap video and want to punch Matt Jones at every opportunity. But the reality is that 95% of them go to the games, have a couple beers, cheer on the Cards, and go home to their wives and kids and jobs. And they’ll give you a hot dog at the tailgate and share a laugh about this or that. I know these people all too well. \nThe problem is now that those people are hurting. Taking away the UL fan in denial, most UL fans know something bad is coming in the future. And frankly many of them have come to the conclusion that it’s time for Pitino to go. We’ll see if that happens or not, but the fact is they know. They are faced with deciding if they can still passionately support a program with that kind of scandal and a coach who doesn’t seem recognize the severity of this story. And I feel for them and think about if we had the same thing happen at UK. Would my UL friends have sympathy for me and fanhood or would they be ruthless in their criticism? \nMy point in saying that is UL fans have not been unique in their response to this in my opinion. They are either trying to defend their program to the death or figure out how to proceed. But either way they are in a struggling position. It’s easy for the UK fan in Harlan to take great joy in that. They don’t have UL family members or friends. But for those of us living here, who’ve had countless positive encounters with UL people, that makes it tough. Am I supposed to make fun of my uncle or cousins if their program goes on probation and they don’t get to experience an NCAA Tournament this year? Is that what being a fan is all about? \nI want to hear from UK fans living in Louisville. Have you experienced the same kind of mixed emotions as me? Do the UL people you like deserve a little slack in how much grief you give them?

Their fan base is so delusional and I am baffled by the excuses that come from their mouths. Matt was right when he said that if this happened at UK they would be calling for Cal to be fired. I don’t understand how they can back Rick when he is sinking their program. catty October 21, 2015 at 8:15 am | Permalink | Reply \nI’ve lived here all my life. Two of my cousins are jerk arses about UL and I mean nasty arses. I love every bad thing because of them! AND the nasty biotch that works next to me, she STILL thinks it’s a “whore who made all of these lies up.” \nThen there are my son’s best friends that are great guys. They were in his wedding. I love these guys. I don’t want them hurting. Put this stuff on a scale to see which weighs more. Right now, I’m lovin’ it. I won’t say anything to the jerks, but will be sympathetic to the younger guys when I see them.

BETH October 21, 2015 at 8:17 am | Permalink | Reply \nI’m glad you wrote this article. I have been feeling this way and wondered if I was alone and if it meant my UK fandom wasn’t as strong as others who have been laughing and enjoying the news. I was lucky enough to have been born to a family that bled blue and taught me from a young age that there simply is no other way to live. \nThat said, some of my very best friends and people I love and respect are Cardinal fans. Some of them were loud and enjoyed the years that UK suffered under Billy G and lost in the NIT and some of them even bring up Pay Pal Cal and NCAA death penalties from 30 years ago. This somehow seems different. I am a little happy that Ricky P is going through this, I felt like he deserved it after getting out of the Sypher thing with barely a scar on his reputation (and honestly I’m still a bit pissed he took the UL job when returning to college basketball). I’m sad for just about everyone else in this situation. The kids who didn’t participate in the parties (and I do think there were some who didn’t), the administration and faculty and students at the university (of which my daughter is one), the fans who love their team and have to somehow justify that love in the midst of all of this, the mothers of the recruits who visited during this time wondering if their son or their husband participated, the children of Katina who were born into a life that taught them to use their bodies as a means to make money….all of these people I am sad for. It’s hard to take joy out of a situation with so many losers. \nI still laugh at the memes and “like” the posts and “favorite” the tweets but it’s very difficult to be loud and boisterous and sing “na na na na boo boo” in the faces of my friends who just love their team like I love mine. I do still wonder how they would be acting to my face if the show was on the other foot though… Mathlete October 21, 2015 at 8:18 am | Permalink | Reply \nUK has had its probation years too, let’s not forget that while we consider the plight of our top rival’s fans. I feel bad for the 95% who are probably genuinely embarrassed to throw up an L right now, but the deluded chumps who deny everything (or in rare cases condone it) get nothing but laughter from me.

We all like 24s and throwing up gang signs. \nSeriously tho. This article needs help. If you care about those people then this is good for them. Time to clean up that mess of an athletic department. That’s why thugs like UL cause it portrays a thug lifestyle. They need to get with the normalcy of college sports.

Most are mean, vile people who have no problem saying whatever nasty thing they can come up with about UK. To the few UL friends I have I will keep my mouth shut. But I have no sympathy for the rest of those fans, their coach, AD or program. Believe me, they wouldn’t have any sympathy for us! Post October 21, 2015 at 8:27 am | Permalink | Reply \nI am not really reveling in all this news, although I do find it amusing but I dont know why you keep writing articles sticking up for Louisville fans. I agree with B-Lord40 that the split of obnoxious fans is significantly higher than the 95-5 you imply. \nI can promise one thing though, if this happened at UK, the number of card fans that would be calling for Cal’s head and rubbing it in our faces would be 99.999-0.001 Unsympathetic October 21, 2015 at 8:34 am | Permalink | Reply \nAt some point the Card fans made a conscious decision to root for a program that institutionalizes lying and cheating, that glorifies sleaziness and that openly embraces thug players who are closer to belonging in prison than on the court or field. In other words, they made this bed, and now they have to lie in it. 502Wildcat October 21, 2015 at 8:38 am | Permalink | Reply \nI am a CAT fan that has lived in lville for almost my entire life, with the exception of my college years and I too find this to be a very sensitive subject around my loved one’s and peers. It almost finding out someone you extremely dislike has a terminal illness, it makes you kinda rethink the reason that you dislike this person and how it got this deep in the first place. HOWEVER…. One thing that I get sick of, being a cat in lville, is more often then not we have to take the high road, be the bigger man, and so class. Now granted that is what our fan base is about and that’s what makes us great. But you gotta be honest here had the shoe been on the other foot they would be down here throwing a parade!!! Singing to the praises that “Cal finally got caught”. The whole bases of there fan base is waiting for UK to slip up so they can gloat and finally say there better. If this incident happened at UK, it would be the greatest achievement in UL fans history/Mind. Just think about that as us lville cats continue to take the high road #BBN ClutchCargo October 21, 2015 at 8:40 am | Permalink | Reply \nWhile I too have several people near and dear to me, as well as neighbors and coworkers who are U of L fans, that doesn’t change anything about the satisfaction I feel as I watch the U of L athletics department twisting in the wind. I don’t have to do anything different, because I don’t typically run my mouth about sports unless someone else starts it first. I can care about those people and still hate the Cards. See how that works? StrokerAce October 21, 2015 at 8:41 am | Permalink | Reply \nDuring the end of Tubby’s tenure and the entire Billy G debacle, I found myself cheering for our rivals to lose as much, if not more, than I found myself cheering for us to win. I knew we weren’t national contenders, so I just wanted to make sure none of our other rivals had success. \nThe best thing Cal’s done since he’s been here is brought us back to the national stage, and now, I know we’re going to be in the thick of things year in and year out, so I’ve found that all I worry about is cheering for us and not worrying about any other programs. Don’t get me wrong, still love it when UL, Duke, UNC, etc. lose, but it doesn’t consume my fanhood like I allowed it to for a few years before Cal arrived. \nWith all that said, I still find it hard to feel much sympathy for the Louisville program in general, but I do feel for the few rational Card fan friends I have. Greg October 21, 2015 at 8:41 am | Permalink | Reply \nI graduated from U of L twice…but have hated their sports programs since at least 1975. I bleed the bluest of blue but a big chunk of my friends and family are red through and through. I moved to Georgia a few years ago and expected to get away from these people, holidays not withstanding. However, my company hired a Louisville fan about a year ago. He is on the delusional side of this fence. \nThe fall is sad and pathetic. Pitino has to go or whatever credibility is left at U of Scumville is lost. But that doesn’t mean we as UK fans should be overly giddy. Rubbing it in a little is to be expected, but going over the top is not in our best interest. The line I keep hearing from BBN is that whether Rick knew or not he needs to go. How many of these UK fans have said that what happened at UMass and Memphis under Cal didn’t apply to Cal because he didn’t know? This is where I struggle to push too hard on the Card Nation. If Pitino really had no clue (which I find virtually impossible), then should he not receive the same kind of pass we give Cal on those other events? Or is the sex and money too much to over look? \nI don’t have a good answer, but am glad we as BBN are asking the question of ourselves.

We give each other barbs here and there, talk about each other’s respective fan bases, a lament wins and losses. When playing against each other, the gloves come off. However, as a lifelong unabashed UK fan, one that loved Rick Pitino when he was our coach, I can’t bring myself to rub it in mercilessly. Yes, I will laugh at the jokes and make my comments, but, UK fans, we must be careful. What goes around comes around! I think Cal runs an excellent program and none of this crap is near our athletes. But it wasn’t long ago that Team Turmoil, Billy G, and even Emery Worldwide were causing all of us the same type of agony!! This isn’t good for any person, program, or even our state to have to endure. I’m thankful its not UK!! Go Cats!

At the end of the day, we all just want the truth to come out and for people to accept the consequences. While I don’t honestly want their program to be in shambles, I don’t feel bad because 1.The evidence is pointing to this as actually happened. 2. I fully believe if the roles were reversed, all I would hear all day from UL fans was how they knew Cal was terrible and should be fired, etc. etc. 3. It’s sickening how much the fan base and the media in Louisville constantly defend Ricky P and Jurich. To me, it’s a rivalry and I wouldn’t care of UL lost every game it ever plays from now until the end of time! TJY October 21, 2015 at 9:04 am | Permalink | Reply \nI graduated from UK in 95 and moved to Louisville and have lived here for the last 20 years. When I first entered the work force I was bombarded with UofL fans and we butted heads. But over the years I really grew to love the city and made real friends that are, perish the thought, UofL fans. \nIt wasn’t until 2012 that I completely changed my outlook on Louisville. I went to NOLA with my wife and a UK buddy who lives in Nashville. As we walked down Bourbon St, it was covered in UofL Red and every 200 feet or so, a UofL fan would yell at me and it would be someone I had worked with, played volleyball with, coached their kid in football, etc but it was always a UofL fan. My friend then asked me if I even knew any UK fans anymore. That is when it really hit me that many of the people I am close to love the Cardinals. \nThe Final Four game between UofL and UK was half red and half blue and I was impressed that UofL travelled as well as UK. After that euphoric feeling of winning a title, I was left to talk to my close friends and they congratulated me but were of course disappointed that their team didn’t win. That is when it hit me that I wish my friends could experience the same joy I did. The next year they won it all and I was genuinely happy for them because I like them as people. \nDon’t get me wrong, there are plenty of UofL fans I would love to laugh at but there are many UK fans I would like to tell to shut up as well. Overall, I feel bad for my friends that passionately love their Cards, and I wish it would all go away. I like UK to win vs teams at full strength, beating a team with less talent is only so fun.

WKU October 21, 2015 at 9:05 am | Permalink | Reply \nAs a WKU fan first and a UK fan second I feel sympathy for the ville. Reason being, if this goes on there I can guarantee you this sort of thing happens at a lot of big time schools. I have a hard time believing this started at UL. They are likely keeping pace with other big time programs, they just got caught. Maybe other schools aren’t buying hookers but I bet a ton of alcohol gets provided to them at parties and a good possibility that weed makes it in there too. This is the world we live in and these are some of the things that make a “good” party. I’d be cautious of hammering UL too much lest the tables get turned in the future. Don’t get me wrong, Pitino and the administration need to go. UK needs a good rival not one thats in the dumpster .

He’s lots of times wearing a UK cap. Lots of times this makes me ashamed to don the same gear. But idiots exist in all fan bases, and to make a singular assertion about a fan base is unwise. So, I echo the sentiment from this article. \nThen again, this is a competitive enterprise that feeds off the animal instincts of people in order to create a very lucrative business venture. In such scenarios there is almost always deviation from ethics, because to indulge animal instincts is to promote irrational thinking and to do what is not right in order to achieve what ends up being only a temporary advantage before the caca hits the fan. \nBy this rationale which I believe to be true based on evidence of lucrative ventures in the past, UK is probably pushing the limits of ethics as well. That’s not to say they are have stripper parts in their dorms, but there are countless other ways this could go down. \nAs a UK “fan” in Louisville (I’m not fanatic, just an appreciator of how their players play the game, really), I merely keep in mind that every fan base and every program has its faults and at the end of the day I can do without UK basketball, KSR, and BBN What does it really even matter in the grand scheme of things?
