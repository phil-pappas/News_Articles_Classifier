In the Tornadoes' second season as an Apollo Conference member, Odam's squad has a conference title and 8-0 record. \nQuarterback Blake Heimsness had his best game of the season, 222 yards and 3 touchdowns of 77, 64 and 34 yards, to beat Mattoon 45-17 in a winner-take-all conference clash on Friday. \nThe defense continued its great season with three first-half forced fumbles to help take the lead. The unit is allowing only about 9.4 points per game. \nThe Tornadoes (8-0) go for an undefeated regular season this week against Chillicothe Illinois Valley Central (1-7). \nOdam's coaching his 7th season at Taylorville. \nQ: How's it feel to win   title outright? \nA: It feels pretty good. It was nice going into the game knowing this was winner-take-all, win or lose. We kind of pounded it into the kids all week about setting your own legacy for the rest of your lives, and all that kind of talk. To have it happen was pretty sweet. \nQ: With this your second year in the Apollo since moving over from the Central State Eight, can you say it's been a successful transition? \nA: I think the results kind of speak for themselves for sure, but our philosophy, the way we run practice, the way we try to be as physical as possible -- all the things we had to do to try to win games in the Central State Eight -- none of that has changed in our preparation for the Apollo teams. \nWe keep coming back to our community is a blue collar community that fights and struggles for everything we can get, and our kids are no different and our football program is no different. We do the best with what we've got and our kids really take to that. \nWe have pretty spirited practices and that'll never change. \nQ: In Friday's game, you forced three fumbles in the first half that helped you guys get going and take a lead. All season it seems like your defense has been really keen on creating turnovers, why is that? \nA: I think it starts with practice. One of the things our defensive coaches looked at in the offseason was how to get more efficient and do things a little bit better so all the kids are on the same page. The first 20 minutes of every practice, they've got a set routine. I could call my defense together right now on the phone and say I want you to go out and do our fundamental rotation and in 20 minutes they'd have it all done. They do it every day. \nPart of that is tackling. Part of that is taking turnovers. Part of that is getting off the ball and things like that. It's a daily routine and they've got a great practice schedule. We've got great kids that work hard. Doing the same things every day kind of reinforces that they're important -- that the attention to details matter. \nQ: This defense is shaping up to be maybe your best defense since you've been at Taylorville. Who are some guys who have stood out this year? \nA: Brett Langen has had a great year. Brett's presence over there does a great job for us. Jimmy Barry had a span of two or three weeks where he had five or six interceptions. He's done a great job. \nTanner Thomason right now is playing really well in the secondary. He's a young man who has really grown and developed in the offseason, physically, mentally and emotionally, and we're very proud of him for that. Tucker May's been slowed by injury but came back Friday night and had a heck of a game. \nAnd in the middle, Travis Winans is a young man that really had to buy his time. He's not the biggest kid in the world, but he's highly intelligent, and he plays his middle linebacker position with a lot of passion and a lot of intelligence. He's a young man in the middle who's kind of been our rock. He gets everyone lined up in the right place. He's a voice of reason out there and he's done a really great job for us. \nQ: Blake had his best passing game on Friday. How have you seen him progress throughout this season, specifically as a passer? \nA: A lot of things we have Blake do are with his feet. He understands that, that's just the way the offense is. I'll go back to last year with Tanner Champley, when we got into a pinch with third-and-short or third-and-long, we'd run power and counter with him. It's the thing we did. We relied on the guys up front more than anything. And that's how we've kind of evolved this year as well. \nBlake's a more polished passer than what we had last year. He's certainly got a bigger arm than what we had last year. It wasn't so much that Blake developed something special throughout the year -- he could always do those things -- but we needed him to throw the ball more against Mattoon than what we have in weeks past. It was more of a game planning thing. \nQ: You're 8-0. Did you see this coming? \nA: It was kind of weird. As the offseason kind of wore on, and wore on, and wore on, that's a long 80 days in the weight room. Some days you're attendance isn't great, some days your attendance is really good. Some days your effort isn't real good and some days it's great. It was a very hit and miss type of offseason for us. \nBut one of the things we noticed as we got into summer camp and into 7-on-7s, our kids, really, when they show up they can really get after it. Maybe even more so than groups we've had in the past. They may not like the daily grind as some groups, but when the lights are on and shining brightest, that's when they really show up. \nAs far as expectations, we didn't really talk about it. We didn't quite know what we had. We had some ups and downs in the offseason. Offensively, we replaced 10 guys. It's hard to set expectations when you're basically starting over on offense. As the pieces kind of fell together throughout the season -- we made some changes Week 5 and Week 4 as far as tight end and offensive line -- and that really kind of gelled us for the most part. \nQ: Sounds like it's a really fun group to coach. \nA: I don't know if fun is the right word. Last year's group was a lot of fun because they had a lot of funny characters. The kids themselves were a lot of outgoing kids that would say anything in any moment and that made them really fun. \nThis group is a lot more laid back. They do things at their own pace and we've embraced that as coaches. But on Friday nights when we're coming out and running power and getting 5 or 6 yards a carry, and the defense is coming up with some big stops, that's when our kids have a lot of fun. \nIt's been fulfilling to watch these guys grow and really blossom into what's happened. That's been a real joy to watch. Odam", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:11:56.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
