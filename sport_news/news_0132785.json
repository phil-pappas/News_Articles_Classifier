Romain Grosjean was eighth for Ferrari ahead of Dutch teenager Max Verstappen in his Toro Rosso and Australian Daniel Ricciardo who was 10th for Red Bull.\nAfter another curtailed practice session during the morning, when Sainz survived his high-speed crash at Turn 13, qualifying began with the two Mercedes men, led by Rosberg, leading the way in welcome dry conditions. Both ran on the harder of the two available tyre compounds.\nIn the absence of Sainz, only four cars faced the early cut after Q1 and, after a late decision to join the fray, they were led by Fernando Alonso who marked his 250th Grand Prix by winding up in 16th place in his McLaren. Out with him went Marcus Ericsson of Sauber and the two Manor Marussia men Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi. It mattered little for Alonso, of course, as he faced a 25-place grid penalty after being fitted with a new Honda engine.\nIn Q2, Hamilton demonstrated finally that he had learned the circuit by clocking a lap in 1:37.672, faster than his team-mate by six-tenths of a second before Rosberg responded to go quicker still by 0.172 seconds.\nA late effort from Ricciardo lifted him from 13th to eighth while Felipe Massa flopped in his Williams and failed to make the cut into the top-ten shoot-out finishing down in 15th. \"I had traffic on the first lap, then I lost the tyres completely at the rear on my final lap,\" said a disappointed Massa.\nOut with him went local hero Daniil Kvyat in his Red Bull who was 11th followed by Felipe Nasr in the second Sauber, Jenson Button in the second McLaren and Pastor Maldonado in his Lotus. \"I just couldn't get the fronts working,\" said Button, who added that he was \"reasonably happy with his time, but we couldn't have done a time for Q3.\"\nAs Q3 began, Sainz was busy in hospital where he was photographed organising a television to allow him to watch the qualifying session and trying to persuade his medical staff to allow him out to race on Sunday.\n\"All ok!.. Nothing to worry about!\" he tweeted. \"Already thinking about how to convince doctors to let me run tomorrow...\"\nOn their initial runs, Rosberg set the pace with a lap in one minute and 37.113 seconds, three-tenths quicker than Hamilton, with Bottas third ahead of Vettel. For the two Mercedes men, it was a signal for a final battle, but neither could improve in the cooling conditions", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:44:54.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
