And, yes, sunscreen will still help you avoid getting skin cancer. But it turns out that a commonly used ingredient in brand-name sunscreens damages the environment. A study published in an academic journal this week concludes that oxybenzone guts coral reefs. NPR reports that \"some 14,000 tons of screen lotions wind up in coral reefs around the world each year.\"\nCoral reefs -- called the \"rainforests of the seas\" by the World Resources Institute -- are increasingly stressed everywhere. Sunscreen is not the greatest threat to reefs, but it's playing a significant part in their decline. Writes the Washington Post : \"Not only did the study determine that a tiny amount of sunscreen is all it takes to begin damaging the delicate corals ... it documented three different ways that the ingredient oxybenzone breaks the coral down, robbing it of life-giving nutrients and turning it ghostly white.\"\nThe damage isn't just from scuba divers and other ocean-goers: sunscreen washed down a shower drain often finds its way to the ocean through sewer overflow systems.\n\"We have lost at least 80 percent of the coral reefs in the Caribbean,\" study co-author Craig Downs told the Washington Post. \"Any small effort to reduce oxybenzone pollution could mean that a coral reef survives a long, hot summer, or that a degraded area recovers.\" He added: \"The use of oxybenzone-containing products needs to be seriously deliberated in islands and areas where coral reef conservation is a critical issue.\"\nSunscreen products without oxybenzone do exist, though they aren't the most popular brands.
