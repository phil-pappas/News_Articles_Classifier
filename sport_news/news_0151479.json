Posted: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 8:34 am Lady Tigers fall short in Longview By JORDAN MOSS Tribune sports writer dailytribune.net | 0 comments The Mount Pleasant Lady Tigers were defeated in straight sets by the Longview Lady Lobos on Tuesday night. In the first set Longview jumped out to a 5-1 lead before the Lady Tigers fought back to even things up at 5-5. From there the Lady Lobos outscored Mount Pleasant 20-8 on their way to a 25-13 victory. The second set saw the Lady Tigers fight and even the battle all the way to the end. The two squads traded points throughout the early going of the set. With the score tied at 15-15 Longview began to pull away from Mount Pleasant. The Lady Lobos eventually pulled away from the Lady Tigers and took the second set 25-22. Down two sets to none it became do or die for Mount Pleasant. The third set proved to be another evenly fought battle as the two squads once again fought, locked up at 15-15. The Lady Lobos went on a 7-0 run to build a 22-15 lead that Mount Pleasant could not overcome. The Lady Tigers fell to Longview by a score of 25-16 in the final set. Precious Thompson led the Lady Tigers in both kills and digs with 11 and 10. Nikki Martin led the assist category with 11. Head coach Jeremy Stewart was not pleased with his team’s performance on the court Tuesday night. “There wasn’t any effort there tonight,” Stewart said. “We didn’t come out expecting to win. When you don’t expect to win you have to not only beat the other team you have to beat yourself.” The Lady Lobos height caused problems for Mount Pleasant but Stewart did not feel it was something the Lady Tigers shouldn’t be used to. “We play tall teams year long,” Stewart said. “We’ll never be the taller team and we know how to handle that. But we just didn’t show up tonight.” For now Stewart has to get his team ready to move on from defeat quickly. “We’re going to have to get ready for Friday,” Stewart said. Friday is a huge game for us, every game now is huge, and they have to understand that.” Earlier in the evening the Mount Pleasant freshman volleyball team fell to Longview 2-1 with scores of 25-22 (Mount Pleasant) and 25-15 and 25-12 (Longview). The junior varsity team lost to the Lady Lobos in straight sets by scores of 25-22 and 25-19. The Mount Pleasant Lady Tigers volleyball team will next be in action at 4:30 p.m. this Friday when they travel to Sulphur Springs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:31:07.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
