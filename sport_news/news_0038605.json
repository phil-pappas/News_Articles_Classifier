Feng, the Chinese world No. 7, kept the pace with six birdies of her own at the Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club. Michelle Wie, who like Lee played a role in the United States’ emotional Solheim Cup victory over Europe last month, was also at 5-under along with Chinese Taipei’s Tseng Ya-ni and Chella Choi of South Korea. World No. 1 Park In-bee, also of South Korea, carded a 3-under 71 with three birdies on an otherwise clean card.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:37:27.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
