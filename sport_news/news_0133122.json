The goal came on the first power play of the game for the Blues (2-1-0), who had been short-handed four times in the first period.\nParakyo scored again with 32 seconds left in the second on another long shot from the same distance, this one changing directions slightly on the way and slipping under Hiller's arm.\nIt was the third straight goal for St. Louis, which entered the period down 2-1, but tied it at 2:49 when Troy Brouwer scored on a breakaway. Scottie Upshall also scored for the Blues.\nMason Raymond, Jiri Hudler and David Jones scored for Calgary (1-2-0). The Flames, who fell to 0-2 at home.\nCalgary was held to just 10 shots through 40 minutes, but got back to within one 1:42 into the third period on a bad turnover by Blues captain David Backes. Michael Frolik quickly fed Jones, who scored his first of the year.\nThe Flames weren't able to find the equalizer despite a late push in the final couple minutes.\nBrian Elliott had 15 saves to improve to 2-0-0 on the season. Hiller turned aside 24 shot in falling to 1-1-0.\nThe Blues have dominated the Flames in recent years going 7-0-1 in their last eight games. During that span, St. Louis hadn't trailed in a game to the Flames until Raymond scored 1:14 into the first period on the first shot of the game.\nThe Flames retook the lead at 17:31, finally converting on a power play. Johnny Gaudreau earned his fifth point of the season by setting up Hudler.\nNotes: St. Louis lost defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk (lower body) in the second period and Calgary left-winger Lance Bouma (lower body) also hobbled off the ice and never returned in the second. ...
