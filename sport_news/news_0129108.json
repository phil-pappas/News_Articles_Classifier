To come in here and get it going into the last three games, it’s huge.” \nWith a light snow falling, the Ticats improved to 10-5, giving them a two-point lead over the Toronto Argonauts and the Ottawa RedBlacks. Finishing first would earn Hamilton, which had qualified for the playoffs after a B.C. Lions loss on Saturday, a bye to the East final. \nAnd it’s beginning to look like the loss of quarterback Zach Collaros won’t hurt the Ticats as much as many figured (including this corner). \nPlenty of football remains to be played before we can make a final evaluation of quarterback Jeff Mathews, but the 24-year-old continues to improve. \nIf you’re nitpicking, you’re emphasizing that Justin Medlock was called upon to attempt six field goals before an announced crowd of 23,058 at Percival Molson Stadium. Medlock was good on five of them, providing the Ticats with the bulk of their points. \nIf you’re stressing the positive, it’s that Mathews completed 21 of 25 passes for 241 yards and one touchdown, a three-yard strike to Terrell Sinkfield in the second quarter. \nIn his third start in the Canadian Football League, Mathews, who accidentally bit off a chunk of his tongue on one play, was sacked three times but was not rattled. Offensive co-ordinator Tommy Condell devised a solid game plan, and the Ticats ran the football efficiently. \nMathews fumbled once and he did not throw an interception. \n“You would love to (get to the end zone more often),” Mathews said. “They are a great defence, we knew that coming in. \n“If we could convert some of those field goals to touchdowns, it’s a blowout. We did what we needed to do to win, there are things we need to improve on, but it was a fun game. We got out on the right end.” \nMathews’ counterpart, veteran Kevin Glenn, was picked off by the Tiger-Cats defence three times. Glenn had said on Saturday he would have liked more time to get accustomed to the Montreal offence after he was acquired from Saskatchewan earlier in the week, and his fears were realized. It didn’t help that on at least four occasions, Alouettes receivers dropped catchable passes. \nGlenn connected with Fred Stamps on a 16-yard touchdown, a major that came with 1.3 seconds remaining in the game. Montreal fell to 5-10 and its playoff hopes now lie in a possible crossover spot in the West Division. \nThere was a blocked punt by the Ticats’ Mike Daly, a play that led to Sinkfield’s touchdown. \nHamilton, which led 13-2 at halftime, lost linebacker Simoni Lawrence (upper body) and running back Mike Ford (lower body) to injuries. Though head coach Kent Austin did not have an update on either player, Lawrence joked with reporters in the locker room after the game and probably is day to day. \n“You have to grow as a football team and part of that is to play well in places where you have had tough games,” Austin said of the victory. “It’s another step for our team. \n“You can’t have a chance to win the whole thing unless you are in the playoffs, so the first goal is accomplished.” \nTASKER HAULS IN A BEAUTY \nJeff Mathews said he has seen something similar from Luke Tasker “100 times in practice.” \nWe’ll give Mathews some leeway for exaggeration, but there’s no doubting the talent and determination Tasker brings to each play. \nIn the third quarter of a Hamilton Tiger-Cats’ win against the Montreal Alouettes, Mathews launched a pass downfield to Tasker. As he was falling to the field, Tasker leaned back and made an over-the-shoulder catch. Tasker got up and scampered approximately 16 more yards for a 43-yard reception. \n“Was that not an unbelievable catch?” Ticats coach Kent Austin said. “It’s what that guy does. You get it near him, he is going to typically come down with the football. To arch his back like he did and to track it all the way, it was a pretty amazing catch.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:32:27.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
