Everybody says that I have the qualities, I just have to work hard and the goals will come.\" \nOrigi has been impressed with Klopp's approach since he replaced Rodgers at the helm following a rocky start to the campaign and believes the team will only improve once they adapt to a fresh approach. \n\"He just wants to play with passion and no fear,\" the striker said of Klopp. \n\"He believes in everybody - the young players, the old players, we're all here because we have quality. We just have to work hard and trust him and we all trust him, so I think we can have a good season. \n\"When you look at the coach, he sends out a very strong feeling, a very powerful feeling. You can see it through the team. \n\"Against Tottenham we had a lot of energy, we pressed, we played with a lot of joy. We are a very strong together as a club with the fans also, it's a very nice thing.\" \nOrigi may have hit the crossbar in the early stages but Tottenham then had the better chances to win the game with Clinton Njie, Harry Kane and Dele Alli all coming close. \nSpurs remain unbeaten in the league since the opening weekend defeat to Manchester United and have now kept three clean sheets in their five home games. \nDefender Jan Vertonghen was full of praise for fellow Belgian international Mousa Dembele who came into the side to replace the suspended Eric Dier and put in a man-of-the-match performance in the holding midfield role. \n\"I spoke to him this week,\" he said. \n\"Obviously we have got some injuries and suspensions, he was ready to play and I think he is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and I think everyone agrees on that, he is a nightmare to play against and a joy to play with him. \n\"I gave him some bad balls and wanted to say sorry but then he quickly turns and throws some of the midfielders in the stands, he is an unbelievable player and I hope he can stay fit, I hope he is back now for the rest of the season.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:09:06.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
