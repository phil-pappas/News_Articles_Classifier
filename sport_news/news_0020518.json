The Australians have performed extremely well in this World Cup so expectations are very high, while the Scots come into the tie as underdogs looking to spring a surprise. The Wallabies enjoyed a strong start to the World Cup and ultimately progressed from the pool of death as winners, dispatching England with ease before seeing off Wales with a fantastic defensive display. Twickenham has suddenly become a home away from home for the Aussies and the famous old ground is now the scene of two momentous, but different wins so far for the men from Down Under at this World Cup. The game against England was mostly about the pressure they applied, and some razzle dazzle off the back of that. The win against Wales was mostly about the pressure they absorbed, and the stoic nature of their defence. Two great games, two famous wins. Can Michael Cheika’s charges make it three in a row at ‘home base’? If recent history is anything to go by, the gold jerseys could struggle. The Highlanders have won two of the last three games between the sides. Who can forget that famous day in Newcastle in 2012, when a full southerly gale was blowing the ball back over the kickers’ heads, like a high-lofted chip shot at St Andrews? The Scots thrived in those conditions. Go further back and the results swing the way of the southern hemisphere side. The teams have played 28 times over the years, and the two-time world champions have won 19. However, one would be a fool to write Vern Cotter’s troops off, especially in this tournament, where the gap between the bigger and smaller nations has narrowed so noticeably. The Brave Hearts have just come off an epic encounter with Samoa – one of the most entertaining games of this or any World Cup. The British side was its own worst enemy for most of that game. But they pulled up their socks to come through when it mattered most. Cotter’s crop made hard work of securing second place in Pool B with that tough 36-33 win over Samoa. Prior to that the boys in navy went down 34-16 to a determined South Africa, who were still smarting from their 34-32 loss to Japan. The Europeans were able to dispatch of the United States of America andthe Japanese in their opening two group games. The northern hemisphere side’s task this weekend has been made harder by the suspensions of forwards Ross Ford and Jonny Gray. Should they pull off an upset, it would deliver a first semi-final appearance in 24 years. While for the Rugby Championship holders, David Pocock and Israel Folau, who has missed much of training after rolling his ankle against England, have both been ruled out.
