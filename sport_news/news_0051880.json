The Lady Stars were in the same scenario in last year's finals against Blackman before dropping their only district game (20-25) of the year. \nHistory looked ready to repeat itself in game three again Thursday. Blackman took its first lead of the match at 2-1 and led five times, including a three-point lead at 10-7, before Siegel reeled off a 10-0 run to help secure another championship. \n“(Siegel coach Shawn Robinson) has been on me this whole year about tempo, tempo, tempo. It's playing our game instead of playing down to the speed of the other team. In (game three) we set the pace of the game,” said tournament and regular season MVP Kristin Demonbreun. \nThe senior had five of her 33 assists during the run. “That starts with the pass, then it goes to me, and then it goes to the hitters. We've all got to do our job and it's really all about the tempo that gets us going.” \nJunior Leah Poarch collected three kills and a block during the crucial run to help close out the match. \n“We knew that we had to push and finish,” Poarch said. “Since it was a tie game it was pretty much like starting 0-0 and just a quick game to 15. We just had to get the lead quick and fight.” \nThe Lady Stars jumped out to a 7-1 lead to open the match and closed out the first game with a 14-4 run. Blackman kept it closer in the second game, including a 13-13 tie, but Siegel scored seven of the game's final eight points for the 2-0 lead. \n“We tried composing ourselves and tried to stay positive more than negative and didn't focus on individuals; we were more of a team,” Blackman senior Tristyn Lozano said. “We kind of just got drained (after the 10-7 lead in game three). We were making mistake after mistake and we thought it was over, and then toward the end we realized it was not over and we decided to push. But by that time it was too late.” \nSiegel will play host to a Region 4-AAA semifinal against the Columbia-Livingston Academy loser, while Blackman will travel to the winner for its region match. The semifinal winners secure a spot in the sectional round. The Lady Stars are going for their third straight region title. \nSiegel advanced to the finals after a 25-13, 25-22, 25-14 win against host Stewarts Creek, while third-seeded Blackman dropped the first game against second-seeded Riverdale before winning the next three (24-26, 28-26, 25-23, 25-20).
