Source: AP\nWith the Wolverines just 10 seconds away from what look an inevitable victory, Melbourne-born O’Neill botched a last-minute punt to hand the game to the Spartans 27-23.\nO’Neill fumbled the snap, lost the ball as he tried to punt it again and the Spartans pounced for a touchdown to complete one of the craziest endings ever seen in college football.\nUnsurprisingly, O’Neill copped some nasty treatment on social media after the nationally-televised match but many leapt to his defence.\nHate tweets sent to Blake O&apos;Neill are a disgrace. Ignore them Blake! @blakewoneill True M fans know you are a star. Mistakes happen. @GoBlue\n— Gene Sperling (@genebsperling) October 18, 2015 Let&apos;s keep it real UM fans. If I&apos;m Blake O&apos;Neill&apos;s dad, I&apos;m tempted to wrap him in my arms and never let go. We all bleed red. #MSUvsMICH\n— Chris Edwards (@edwardswxwxyz) October 18, 2015 I&apos;m still sick to my stomach for that punter...Blake O&apos;Neill wasn&apos;t trying to fail...hoping people have a bit of compassion for him\n— Joel Klatt (@joelklatt) October 17, 2015 Many were earlier hailing O’Neill’s booming punt as one of the greatest in college football.\nWow. That&apos;s the best punt I&apos;ve ever seen. Blake O&apos;Neill catches the jet stream for an 80-yarder.\n— Dan Murphy (@DanMurphyESPN) October 17, 2015 Lot&apos;s of \"WOWs\" up here in the box on Blake O&apos;Neill&apos;s 80-yd punt.\n— Ricky Lindsay (@RLindz35) October 17, 2015 Blake O&apos;Neill deserves a lot of credit. Solid punter who continues to pin opponents deep in their own territory. #GoBlue\n— Scott C. (@Kilo1899) October 10, 2015 The O&apos;Neill punt is a mainland U-M record, though.
