Franklin) more > By - Associated Press - Saturday, October 10, 2015 \nPHOENIX (AP) - Center Alex Len scored 14 of his team-high 21 points in the first half and Markieff Morris added 18 points in 16 minutes, leading the Phoenix Suns to a 101-85 win over the Utah Jazz Friday night. \nGordon Hayward led Utah with 24 points, including four 3-pointers in a team-high 32 minutes. \nUtah led 47-45 at halftime. The Suns pulled away behind a 3-pointer from Brandon Knight late in the third quarter that gave them an 80-67 lead. \nJAZZ: Coach Quin Snyder said before the game he wanted to see how a bigger backcourt combination is developing, with the emphasis on how Hayward, Alec Burks and Rodney Hood played together. Burks played 23 minutes and scored six points, and Hood played 24 with eight points. \nSUNS: Forward Jon Leuer, who had 17 points and 13 rebounds in the Suns’ preseason opener against Sacramento, didn’t see action until the second half and finished with five points and five rebounds. \nBOOKER SUSPENDED: Jazz forward Trevor Booker will miss one regular season game without pay after the NBA suspended him for his altercation with the Los Angeles Lakers’ Roy Hibbert in a preseason game earlier this week. Booker, who played Friday and scored eight points, was punished by the league for striking Hibbert with an open hand to the head. \nDNP/REST: Jazz guard Trey Burke and forward Joe Ingles were given Friday night off. Burke is averaging 12.5 points, four rebounds and four assists in two preseason games. Suns starting guard Eric Bledsoe did not play Friday, rested by coach Jeff Hornacek. \nUP NEXT: The Jazz host the Portland Trail Blazers in their fourth preseason game on Monday night. The Suns host the Houston Rockets in their third preseason game on Tuesday night. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:49:47.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
