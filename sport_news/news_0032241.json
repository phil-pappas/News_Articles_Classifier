We kicked off last week with readers' favorite Portland happy hours . This week, we asked for your favorite beer bars. Cocktail, wine and classic bars are still to come.\nIn the poll below, we've collected our 2014 guide to Portland's 10 best beer bars, then added suggestions submitted via comments , email and Twitter . We'll keep the poll open until Wednesday of next week, then announce the winners in a separate post.\nA quick note: For this poll, we're focused on beer bars, not brewpubs (as much as we liked the latter). Also, we combined a couple of sister bars into one. Prost fans should cast their vote for Stammtisch, while aficionados of The Upper Lip should go with Bailey's Taproom.\nSo, which Portland beer bar is your favorite?\n-- Michael Russell Follow @tdmrussell", "external_links": ["http://app.contenttools.co/polls/1988/embed.js?show_name=no&show_description=no&show_sharing_options=no&show_cover_image=yes", "https://twitter.com/tdmrussell"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:16:25.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
