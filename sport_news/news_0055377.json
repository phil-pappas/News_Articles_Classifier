The rows of bars along Clark Street were empty except for a few stragglers around lunchtime. Mothers pushed strollers, and twentysomethings walked their dogs past brick rowhouses that were dotted with Halloween décor and Cubs flags. The rumbling of trains along the elevated tracks provided a soundtrack, and the trees, whose leaves have turned yellow, orange and red, provided the backdrop.\nThat would all change as the day rolled on, as fans converged at the intersection of Clark and Addison Streets in anticipation of what in this city is a rare treat, late October baseball — Game 3 of the National League Championship Series between the Mets and the Cubs.\nBesides its ivy-covered brick walls and century-old charms, one of the allures of Wrigley Field is the surrounding neighborhood.\n On Baseball: Welcome to Wrigley, Where the Bleachers Will Be Beckoning OCT. 20, 2015 Behind Thick-Rimmed Glasses, Cubs’ Joe Maddon Takes a Rose-Colored Approach OCT. 19, 2015 Mets 4, Cubs 1: Daniel Murphy (Who Else?)

From a Place They Never Had: Wrigley OCT. 13, 2015 Wrigley is unlike the suburban parks of the 1970s, or the urban ones that have been built in the past 20 years with a nod toward the past, some of them trying to create a vibrant work-and-play environment.\nPhoto Leroy Legerski, 72, waiting in a firehouse for Wrigley Field’s gates to open before the Cubs played the Mets.

It’s different the way it developed organically, instead of the modern stadiums trying to create this. It’s in the fabric of the neighborhood.”\nThe neighborhood, like the ballpark, which is in the midst of an extensive renovation that includes enormous video boards and an adjacent building that will house the team’s offices, has continued to evolve.\nWells Offutt, who was preparing to pedal his bicycle down Sheffield Avenue, said the neighborhood had undergone a striking change since he arrived in 1978. He pointed to buildings that had been abandoned and lots that had been vacant. But for some time now, the neighborhood has sported those telltale signs of gentrification: a Whole Foods and a Starbucks.\nPhoto Michael Bailey, a former Chicagoan who now lives in Florida, sketching Cubs players on Addison Street in the Wrigleyville section of Chicago.

It’s become a destination. It’s become a place to party and have a good time.”\nBob King, a firefighter at Engine No. 78, across Waveland Avenue, down the left-field line, said that when he began working there 25 years ago, a building next door to the station sold for $289,000. Now, he figures, it would go for at least $2.5 million.\nWhereas the station used to respond to a fire a day, now a vast majority of calls are for medical assistance. As fans pass by on their way in and out of the ballpark, some stop to ask if they can buy T-shirts or patches at the firehouse. Others ask for a photograph.\nPhoto Bruce Mullens-Wricket grew up in Wrigleyville and has been a Cubs fan for 54 years.

The eventual goal is to close off the streets and create an extension of the park, with bars and restaurants.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story For now, fans can congregate outside the players’ parking lot on Waveland and greet them. But next year, the players will park in an underground lot and will be able to enter the ballpark without having any contact with fans — the custom in most, if not all, cities.\nPhoto Fans gathering at Addison and Clark Streets near the 101-year-old ballpark.

Many of the bars opened early, some by 10 a.m., since they were not quite sure when fans would start arriving.\nPhoto Employees of Chicago Beverage delivering beer to Wrigleyville bars.

So were the opportunities to cheer on the Cubs.\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nJustin Dardick and his brother, Sam, stood outside Murphy’s Bleachers, the renowned bar across the street from center field, watching on television. They live in the neighborhood but did not want to pay the $250 that tickets were going or in the upper deck.\nAs the Mets, who would earn a 5-2 victory, scored the go-ahead run in the sixth inning on a wild pitch, it was an indication that for all the changes that have taken place in the neighborhood, perhaps one thing had not changed.\nSam Dardick shook his head.\n“Cubs,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-4/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-4-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-1/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-1-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-2/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/sports/yCUBS1/yCUBS1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-4/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-4-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-3/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-3/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-3-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-2/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-5/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-5-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/21KEPNERweb1/21KEPNERweb1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-5/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-5-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-1/Y-WRIGLEYVILLE-1-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/20/sports/Y-JP-MADDON/Y-JP-MADDON-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/19/sports/19jpMETS1/19jpMETS1-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:37:40.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
