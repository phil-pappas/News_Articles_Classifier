Milton Academy’s offense then marched 86 yards down the field to put the game out of reach, 34-20. The drive was capped off with an 8-yard run by Alec Beesmer with 1:50 left to play.\n“There were a lot of big plays in that game, but nothing bigger than that,” Milton Academy coach Kevin MacDonald said of McDermott’s interception. “We have a very good secondary, but they’re really good. That quarterback (Costello), he’s probably the best in the state. He’s a double threat being able to run and pass, but I didn’t realize how good their receivers are.”\nBeesmer’s touchdown was one of four rushing scores by the Mustangs. The other three were run in by Michael Silva, who tallied 192 rushing yards. Most of them came in the second half after senior captain James Fadule left the game with an injury near the end of the first half.\n“Jimmy going down meant a lot for us. He is the second captain to go down, and originally we wanted to with this game for Dom (Cozier), but in the second half we wanted to win it for the two of them,” Silva said. “We knew without them we needed to step it up, and our line just played phenomenal. I just ran behind them. They made my job easy.”\nBB&N did not go away quietly, continuing to attack the Mustangs with its passing game in the second half. Costello ran for one touchdown, threw three more, connecting for more than 300 passing yards in the game overall, most of which came in the final two quarters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:27:49.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
