Correction: after USC practices.\nFreshman cornerback Iman “Biggie” Marshall almost always stays late to work on his craft. Footwork. Hand placement. Whatever he can think of that might make him better.\n“It’s just the sign of a guy who wants to be great,” said USC coach Steve Sarkisian, whose team plays host to Washington on Thursday night. “He’s not satisfied with where he’s at yet. He’s a heck of a player for a true freshman. But he wants to be special.”\nNo one has to tell Marshall to put in extra work; he does it of his own volition. The five-star recruit from Long Beach Poly hasn’t slacked off since becoming a starter in USC’s third game. If anything, he has spent more time in the deepest corners of the practice field since moving up the depth chart.\n“Him staying after, that’s just something that’s in him,” USC defensive backs coach Keith Heyward said. “He’s done that since he’s gotten here.”\nMarshall did it before he got to USC. But he wasn’t born that way. He learned the value of hard work, preparation and paying attention to details from the most influential person in his life.\nFATHER KNOWS BEST\nTony Marshall’s father was not part of his life. Tony was determined to provide his oldest child, Iman, with a different experience.\n“I wanted to make sure to give my son every chance,” Tony Marshall said by phone this week. “Kids need discipline, structure. Because I didn’t have that – just my mom – there was a lot of unmet potential. I didn’t want him to have the crutch.”\nTony played running back and defensive back at Poly. He continued his football career at Long Beach City College and Texas A&M-Kingsville. (He had an offer from Texas Tech but didn’t qualify academically.) Then he had Iman.\nFrom the time he was 6 years old, Iman wanted to play football. Tony planned to wait until Iman was 11. But by the time he turned 9, it was clear that Iman was ready. He already knew the sport from playing the “Madden” video game with his dad.\nTony considered “Madden” a “great learning tool.” When they played, Tony would have Iman study the responsibilities of every position and how different defensive coverages worked.\n“I made sure he understood the game of football before he played the game of football,” Tony Marshall said.\nIman took to it right away. Playing fullback in his first youth football practice, he scored a long touchdown. The defensive coordinator wanted to know what happened. Iman explained that the center blocked down, the guard peeled and sealed off the linebacker and the rookie fullback cut off the guard’s butt.\n“For him to be able to see that and recite that instantly, it just blew my mind,” Tony Marshall said. “He wasn’t just reacting. He was processing it.”\n1 2 Next Page Related: No. 17 USC vs. Washington: Who has the edge?
