(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \n121 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Michigan's game at Maryland on Saturday has been been moved from 8 p.m. to noon.\nIt will be televised by the Big Ten Network.\nThere has been speculation that the start time would be moved due to the potential for hazardous weather associated with Hurricane Joaquin.\n\"The weather experts are still dealing with uncertain probabilities for the course of Hurricane Joaquin,\" said UM athletic director Jim Hackett. \"Thus we remain vigilant on developments and will err on the side of safety for all participants and fans.\"\nOn Wednesday morning, in light of the impending storms, the BTN announced the studio show that was going to broadcast live from outside Byrd Stadium, had been canceled.\nDETROIT NEWS\nJohn Harbaugh might join Jim on UM sidelines\nJoaquin has strengthened but experts are tracking it heading east. According to a story in the Washington Post on Thursday, while it may not make landfall in that area, “one thing does look certain: extreme rainfall totals are likely for large parts of the Eastern Seaboard, if the storm tracks close to the coast or inland.”\nThe National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA.gov) projects heavy rain and high wind gusts on Friday and Saturday in the College Park, Md., area.\nThe Wolverines are scheduled to fly to Maryland mid-day Friday, but their travel plans could be altered.\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh, during his weekly appearance Thursday morning on the “Stoney and Bill Show” on 97.1, said he had been keeping track of the storm. He said the decision to move the kickoff was up to the home team.\n“So we’ve been told it’s our responsibility to get there and be there and God willing and the creek don’t rise, we’ll be there,” Harbaugh said, using a phrase he often says.\nClearly, fans aren’t as keen on attending the game. A scan of the secondary market on StubHub showed the cheapest tickets for the Michigan-Maryland game had dropped $10 from the night before to $45. A week ago they were more than double.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:15:52.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
