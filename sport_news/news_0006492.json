Hill might also transfer and play his senior season for another school, though. The general thinking of the latter argument is that he could transfer so coaches and players wouldn't have the difficult task of choosing between him and Tanner Mangum as the quarterback and leader of the team. If Hill does come back, who do the Cougars start in 2016? \nHere are arguments for both players as the starting signal caller. \n\nUnless you're Ohio State, you don't bench Heisman candidates. \n\npasses. Though he showed glimpses of being able to beat teams with his arm, the passing game struggled through much of the season. \nLast year, Hill showed marked progress in his decision-making and passing accuracy in the first four games. Before getting hurt, the young quarterback was looking like a legitimate dual threat. In the first half against Nebraska, Hill looked even better as a passer than he did in 2014. Having a dual-threat at the helm of the offense puts a lot of pressure on opposing defenses. Had he played in the Michigan game, for example, the Wolverines would not have been able to play man-press as much because Hill would have run all over them. While Mangum has had a lot of success thus far, he is not a major threat with his legs. The Cougar offense can beat teams in more ways with Hill at the helm. \n\n\nStarting Hill next year would stunt Mangum's progress, and it cannot be realistically asked of him to be happy about sitting on the bench after doing nothing but playing outstanding football. \n\nWhile Hill has made considerable progress in his passing abilities, Mangum has once-in-a-generation arm talent. With some more seasoning, Mangum has the potential to break all kind of passing records. \n\nIf Hill does come back next year, it could potentially be divisive as the team might have split loyalties. \nSelfishly, I would love for Hill to come back because he is the most exciting player I've seen in Provo since Luke Staley. However, after the performances Mangum has put together, it would be hard to justify benching him. As much as I love Hill, it may be time for him to pursue other avenues.
