Coach Jason Garrett said Wednesday he made the move \"to see if we can get our offense going a little bit more.\" The Cowboys (2-3) are on their bye and have about a week and a half to get Cassel ready to face the NFC East-leading New York Giants on Oct. 25. In Cassel, Dallas is picking someone with more experience — and more wins. Cassel made 71 starts for New England, Kansas City and Minnesota and has 33 wins to just five for Weeden, although both have losing records for their careers. The Dallas offense has posed little threat down the field with Weeden. Former player had CTE HARRISBURG, Pa. — Researchers have confirmed that a former NFL lineman from Pennsylvania who died of suicide at 25 had the brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Adrian Robinson Jr.'s diagnosis was confirmed through officials at the NFL brain bank at Boston University. Family lawyer Ben Andreozzi says Robinson had several concussions during two seasons in the league. The family has not filed suit over his May death in Philadelphia. Robinson, of Harrisburg, played for Temple University before playing for Pittsburgh, Denver and San Diego in 2012 and 2013. Head trauma protocol NEW YORK — Houston's Arian Foster and Jacksonville's Bernard Pierce both were on the field with potential head trauma in games last week. The Texans running back returned to play on his own before the team's medical staff could evaluate him. The Jaguars running back showed no symptoms of a concussion until he attempted a block instead of trying to make a tackle on the punt unit. The NFL said both teams properly handled the concussion protocol once they had the opportunity to do so or suspected possible head trauma. Houston's medical staff, including the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant, was preparing to evaluate Foster when he left the bench and ran back onto the field for two plays.
