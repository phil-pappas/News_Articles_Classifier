It was fantastic to see the enthusiasm around that,\" Schmidt told a news conference on Friday. \n\"I know they're up again on Sunday after us and it would be great to have a genuine super Sunday of Irish sport. I've no doubt the fans will vacate the stadium pretty quickly and get to somewhere they can watch that game (against Poland) and make a similar amount of noise.\" \nUlster hooker Rory Best, who is from the Northern Irish county of Armagh, was thrilled to see the North qualify for their first major finals since the 1986 World Cup, when he was just three years old. \n\"We were sort of watching both of them. To qualify is brilliant. The boys have been great the whole way through this campaign. It was very inspirational for us to watch both games,\" Best said. \nThe soccer successes capped off a week when motivation was sought from a range of Irish sports stars after the rugby team were addressed over dinner by former world boxing champion Barry McGuigan, Olympic silver medallist runner Sonia O'Sullivan and champion jockey AP McCoy. \n\"Obviously, there were great stories and we had good chats but I think there is something special about Irish people and that massive level of colloquialism we have,\" Ireland fullback Rob Kearney told reporters. \n\"Bringing all those Irish icons over to us in Wales just brought that all back to us and it was a great touch. A big thing for us is about being Irish and that helped build it.\" \nIreland play France on Sunday in Cardiff in a game that will decide who finishes top of Rugby World Cup Pool D and avoids world champions New Zealand in the quarter-finals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:31:45.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
