So the six-team Colonial Liberty and six-team Colonial Patriot likely would remain intact under the WJFL umbrella. \nThat would ensure teams of five division games against preexisting opponents. \nIn addition, some preexisting crossover games would remain on the schedule - such as the Thanksgiving Day game between Haddonfield and Haddon Heights - but new matchups would be created as well. \nThe WJFL factors in geography as well as group size and program strength in creating crossover games, so Colonial Conference teams likely would play games against nearby opponents. \nPossible crossover games could be matchups such as Paulsboro vs. Glassboro, West Deptford vs. Deptford, Haddonfield vs. Bishop Eustace, Gateway vs. Gloucester Catholic, Collingswood vs. Camden, Woodbury vs. Salem, Audubon vs. Gloucester City, Haddon Township vs. Maple Shade, and Haddon Heights vs. Palmyra, among many others. \nThe proposed merger is seen by proponents as a way to create more competitive schedules for stronger and weaker programs in the Colonial Conference by helping the more powerful teams play more challenging games while allowing the teams in rebuilding stages to face opponents in similar situations. \nUnder Colonial Conference rules, a two-thirds majority, which would be eight of 12 votes in favor, would be required to approve the merger. \nIn December 2013, Colonial Conference schools voted 7-5 against a proposed affiliation with the Cape-Atlantic League that would have allowed for some crossover games. \nWJFL officials have begun the process of creating divisions and crossover games for 2016-2017 that will include the 17 teams from the Cape-Atlantic League. \nThat process would be adjusted to include the 12 Colonial Conference teams. \nThe Cape-Atlantic League teams are expected to join the WJFL in three divisions of six, six, and five teams. \nThe addition of the Colonial Conference would create a league that likely would have 15 divisions of six teams and one division of five teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:45:27.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
