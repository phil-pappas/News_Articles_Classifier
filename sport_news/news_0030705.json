Still, they needed a win on the final day of the regular season to clinch home field in the NL wild-card game. \nThey got that win behind J.A. Happ’s stellar effort and Pedro Alvarez’s long home run Sunday, 4-0 over the Cincinnati Reds. \nThe Pirates will host the Chicago Cubs (97-65) Wednesday in a winner-take-all playoff. \n“We love playing at home,” said Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle, whose team went 53-28 at PNC Park. “Our guys love pitching at home. There’s opportunity for it to be a really good ballgame. \n“I know our fans will show up and it will be loud and it will be proud. Our guys will be ready for it.” \nThe Pirates finished second to the St. Louis Cardinals (100-62) in the NL Central. Pittsburgh will host the wild-card game for the third straight year after beating Cincinnati in the 2013 game and losing to the San Francisco Giants last season. \nThe Pirates had 20 straight losing seasons, the longest streak in major North American professional sports history, before their current run of postseason appearances. \n“We really don’t sit back and look at it too much, as a staff or as a team,” Hurdle said of the turnaround. “I always say that if you focus on being good long enough then you can turn out to be great and we’ve been able to put some good seasons together.” \nHapp (11-8) pitched three-hit ball for six innings. He struck out seven and walked two while improving to 7-2 in 11 starts since being acquired July 31 from the Seattle Mariners. \n“I didn’t have my best stuff but I just tried to execute pitches, move the ball up and down, in and out,” Happ said. \nJoakim Soria, Tony Watson and Mark Melancon finished the six-hitter with one scoreless inning each. \nAlvarez’s 479-foot leadoff home run to center field in the fourth inning, his team-high 27th, made it 2-0 after Josh Harrison doubled in the first and scored on Neil Walker’s single. \nHarrison and Francisco Cervelli each had three of the Pirates’ 13 hits and Jordy Mercer had two.
