All matches are good practice for me. It’s good energy for starting the next season stronger.” \nIn the women’s singles final in Beijing, 22-year-old Muguruza of Spain won 7-5 6-4 in a hard-fought victory for her second WTA title, and will climb to fourth in the world rankings when they are released on Monday. \n“It’s amazing, and I can’t wait to come back and defend my title next year,” she said at the trophy presentation of her biggest title to date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:14:08.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
