Obviously I'd like to win my old belt back in this fight will give me a great ranking with the WBO, but I would fight anyone in the country or the world and I'm excited to be in a great fight on November 7.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:06:33.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
