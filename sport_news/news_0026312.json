Barrett before a game against Penn State on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015. David Jablonski/Staff By Dave Jablonski COLUMBUS — \nOhio State coach Urban Meyer said he will not publicly announce a quarterback decision Monday. \nThe combination of Ohio State having a night game and the the presence of many recruits on campus didn’t leave Meyer enough time to meet with J.T. Barrett or Cardale Jones, and he plans to do that Monday. \nJones started and completed 9 of 15 passes for 84 yards on Saturday in a 38-10 victory against Penn State. Barrett completed 4 of 4 passes for 30 yards and rushed 11 times for 102 yards. He rushed for two scores in the second quarter and threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter. \nMeyer said the offense ran better with Barrett on the field and said he has an idea of who will start next Saturday against Rutgers, but “I want to make sure I visit with everybody and I’m doing the right thing.” More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:23:49.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
