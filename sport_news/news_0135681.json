Dale Earnhardt Jr. qualified fifth to put the four Hendrick drivers in the first three rows at the 2.66-mile supserpseedway. \nIt was the best outcome for Gordon and Earnnhardt, the only two Hendrick drivers still in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field. Both need strong runs — Earnhardt may actually need a victory — to advance into the third round of the playoffs. \nFour drivers will be cut from the Chase field following the race. Gordon is seventh in the standings, while Earnhardt is 11th in the 12-driver field. Both drivers are six-time winners at Talladega, and Earnhardt won the spring race here. \nMatt Kenseth, who is last in the Chase field, qualified fourth. Like Earnhardt, he likely needs to win Sunday to move into the third round. \nPeters wins truck race \nTALLADEGA, Ala. \nTimothy Peters has won the Truck Series race at Talladega Superspeedway for the second consecutive year. \nPeters was second on the final restart Saturday after a multi-truck accident caused a stoppage of 15 minutes for the track to be cleaned. Brandon Jones got a terrific jump as the leader but he pulled too far away from the line of trucks behind him in the bottom lane. \nIt allowed Peters, in the top lane, to catch Jones and pull past Jones for the lead. Then Spencer Gallagher tried to duck down and attempt to pass Peters, but he was hooked by John Wes Townley to bring out a race-ending caution. \nNASCAR said this week it would only make one attempt to finish both the truck race and today’s Sprint Cup Series race under green. \nWarriors coach to miss opener \nOAKLAND, Calif. \nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr will miss the season opener as he continues to recover from back surgery. \nGeneral manager Bob Myers told reporters Saturday that interim coach Luke Walton will coach the team for the season opener against New Orleans on Tuesday night in Oakland. Kerr will be on hand for the banner-raising ceremony but is not ready to take back the coaching duties. \nKerr has been sidelined since the opening week of training camp because of complications from offseason back surgery. The Warriors do not know when he will be healthy enough to return. \nStaff/wire report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:25:41.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
