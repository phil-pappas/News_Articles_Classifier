The Panthers had a bye last week and travel to play Seattle on Sunday. \nKuechly, wearing pads and a helmet, was first in line during individual drills on Tuesday, hitting the blocking sleds seemingly as hard as he could. \nWide receiver Jerricho Cotchery also practiced after missing the last two games with a high ankle sprain. \nDefensive end Jared Allen did not practice after pinching a nerve in his back in the team's Week 4 win against Tampa Bay. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:05:46.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
