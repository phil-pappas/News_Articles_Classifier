Special photo by Cecil Copeland slideshow Despite all the rain in the area, several Cherokee County quarterbacks took to the air Friday night.Cherokee’s Nolan Donley, Creekview’s Kyle Wilkie and Woodstock’s Liam Byrne each threw the ball more than 30 times, each for more than 250 yards.Perhaps the most surprising inclusion on this list was Donley, who threw a season-high 48 times, completing 23 passes for 269 yards in a 31-24 win over Wheeler.While Donley received plenty of help from Brittain Brown, who had more than 200 yards of offense and scored four touchdowns, Cherokee coach Josh Shaw insists his running and passing games rely on one another.“It’s really two different halves,” Shaw said. “In the first half, we were able to pass quite a bit. Then, (Wheeler) took some things away in the second half in the passing game, so we established the running game a little more.”When Wheeler loaded the box in the first half, Donley had plenty of space to get his playmakers the ball. Receivers Montrell Washington and Imad Strozier also took advantage, with Washington hauling in 10 passes for 133 yards and Strozier recording a 51-yard reception.“We’re exceptionally more dangerous when we can throw the ball like that,” Shaw said. “Our offensive coaches did a phenomenal job. They were able to get Montrell the ball quite a bit and spread the ball around. We got a lot more creative getting guys the ball, and Nolan was very efficient and made some outstanding decisions. When we can do both, we’re a much more effective football team. That was a good team we beat (Friday) night.”After throwing for a county-record 487 yards two weeks ago, Wilkie looked to be set back again this week by a sloppy Creekview field. But the game was moved to Etowah, and Wilkie took advantage of the artificial turf.The senior completed 25 of 37 passes for 332 yards, with 261 of those yards coming in the second half of a 28-21 loss to Dalton. Wilkie may have also found a new favorite target in sophomore Trevor Kolb, who caught a game-high 12 balls for 181 yards, including a 28-yard touchdown to tie the game in the fourth quarter.While Creekview and Cherokee got big games out of their usual starters, Woodstock had to turn to junior Liam Byrne to run its pass-oriented offense.Although he had seen time earlier in the season, Byrne was making his first start because of an injury Garrett Bass suffered in the Etowah game.“I think it showed that it was his first start,” coach Brent Budde said. “He was doing it against one of the best defenses we’ve faced all year. Considering that they weren’t afraid to play man, and the adverse weather conditions, I thought he played pretty well. There is definitely room for him to get better, and we expect him to learn from the mistakes that he made and build upon those.”Woodstock’s quarterback may have been different, but the offense was not. Budde said before the game that he felt like “I have my starter in there,” and he proved it by throwing the ball 41 times.Despite being sacked nine times in a 21-14 loss to Lassiter, and having an interception returned for a touchdown as time expired, Byrne kept the Wolverines in the game, completing 20 passes for 279 yards and two touchdowns.Byrne also seemed comfortable spreading the ball around, completing 20 passes for 279 yards to seven different receivers.“I think it’s a huge advantage to feel like we have two starter-caliber quarterbacks,” Budde said. “I think it’s to our benefit to have a system where someone else can come in. In our program, we have several kids who can really throw it, and we believe they can come in and succeed in our offense.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:27:14.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
