The Royals are playing in the Fall Classic for the second straight season. The Mets? This is their first World Series trip since 2000.\nMonday afternoon Royals manager Ned Yost announced his World Series rotation, one day after calling himself a \" punk \" for withholding the information. Edinson Volquez will get the ball in Game 1 Tuesday, and he'll be followed in order by Johnny Cueto , Yordano Ventura and Chris Young . Volquez, Cueto and Ventura would then come back for Games 5-7, if necessary.\nVolquez, 32, started Game 1 of the ALCS against the Blue Jays and threw six shutout innings. He has a 4.32 ERA with an unsightly 15/12 K/BB in three starts and 16 2/3 innings this postseason. The Royals are 1-2 in Volquez's three October starts.\nStarting Cueto in Game 2 allows him to make his two World Series starts -- again, assuming Game 6 is necessary -- at home in Kansas City. Cueto was more effective at home (4.50 ERA) than on the road (4.98 ERA) with the Royals after coming over from the Reds at the trade deadline.\nPerhaps more importantly, pitching at home means Cueto won't have to deal with a ruthless road crowd. The \"Cue-To! Cue-To!\" mock chants were loud and clear at Rogers Centre in Toronto last week, and it appeared to affect him on the field. Cueto took a long time between pitches and was generally out of sorts.\nVentura, amazingly, has the most postseason experience of any starting pitcher in the World Series. He has eight career postseason starts (and one relief appearance) to his credit, during which he's posted a 3.98 ERA and a 35/17 K/BB in 43 innings.\nThe Mets announced their World Series rotation over the weekend . Here are the pitching matchups:\nGame 1, Oct. 27 in KC: Volquez vs. Matt Harvey\nGame 2, Oct. 28 in KC: Cueto vs. Jacob deGrom\nGame 3, Oct. 30 in NY: Noah Syndergaard vs. Ventura\nGame 4, Oct. 31 in NY: Steven Matz vs. Young\nGame 5, Nov. 1 in NY*: Harvey vs. Volquez\nGame 6, Nov. 3 in KC*: Cueto vs. deGrom\nGame 7, Nov. 5 in KC*: Ventura vs. Syndergaard\n* if necessary\nGame 1 of the 2015 World Series will begin Tuesday night at 8pm ET. Edinson Volquez will start Game 1 of the World Series for the Royals.
