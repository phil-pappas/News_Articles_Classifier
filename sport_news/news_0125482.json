This fun debate was made possible by you — the readers — and the passion everyone showed for their classmates. I know there were plenty of names I excluded. That doesn’t mean they weren’t great. They were. Here’s a name for you, thanks to a reader. You know who you are. His name is Paul Bunker. Bunker was born in Michigan and moved to Taunton as a baby. He graduated from Taunton High in 1898 as the best football player in the state. Bunker was named to the first-ever All-American team in 1901 at West Point as a tackle and 1902 as a running back. He remains until this day as the only collegiate player to be named to two different All-American teams. Bunker was later voted into the college Hall of Fame in 1969. He served for our country in World War I and World War II. He died at a POW camp in Japan in 1943. A housing project for low-income people was named after Bunker, which today is called Riverside Apartments. The street inside the complex is still called Paul Bunker Drive. Well there you have it. I hope to be running another series on maybe greatest teams, greatest plays, greatest coaches or maybe even greatest players of their respective schools. That is something to think about. Here’s a look at the list: NANCY (LEGER) BERNIER, Bristol-Plymouth Bernier was an exceptional athlete for the Craftsmen in the mid 1980s. She played in all three sports — volleyball, basketball and softball— for four seasons. Bernier was the volleyball captain for two years and helped her team to the states in that sport as well as basketball and softball. The biggest accomplishment at Bristol Plymouth was scoring 1,000 points in basketball — the first ever. Bernier had 600 points going into her senior season and scored the rest of her career mark. She averages over 20 points per game. During the Apponequet softball dynasty days of four straight years without a loss, Bernier collected a hit off of Marie Pellegrini. The Craftsmen beat the Lakers at the East Taunton Bowl. She is currently training for a marathon n New Hampshire this fall. COURTNEY OLIVER, Coyle-Cassidy When you think about great softball pitchers in the area, Oliver’s name has to be at the top of the list. The former Warrior star hold many school records including career wins (73), career strikeouts (998), winning percentage (.859), career no-hitters (seven), most consecutive wins (21), single-season strikeout totals (296) and tied for season no-hitters (four). Her career earned run average (0.43) is second all-time behind Lauren Peloquin. Opponents hit just .114 off of her during her four-year high school career and she lost just 12 times. Oliver led C-C to their second state title in 2002 with an overall record of 19-2. At the plate, Oliver hit .382 in her career with six home runs and 60 RBI. The Swansea native helped the Hofstra Pride to four NCAA regional tournament appearances — a feat yet to be duplicated by any softball collegiate athlete in the Greater Taunton area. Oliver’s softball collegiate coaching accomplishments include five NCAA conference championships, seven regional and two super regional appearances and has been appointed the softball head coaching position at East Carolina University this past June. She was recently selected to the Coyle-Cassidy Hall of Fame class of 2015. Page 2 of 4 - AMIINA (SIRYON) PFINGSTLER, Taunton During the early 1990’s, there wasn’t a better girls athlete than Pfingstler. Pfingstler was the first player in the history of the Taunton High girls basketball program to crack the 1,000 career point mark. The four-year starter, team captain and Dave Cowens award nominee finished her high school career with 1,176 points and 909 rebounds while leading the Old Colony League in scoring during her sophomore and junior seasons. She was also a three-time OCL all-star selection along with other numerous track and field accomplishments in the triple jump, relays, shot put, and discus at state and New England regional level. Pfingstler was also a Class A Track and Field champion in the 100 meter dash and OCL champion in the 100 meter dash. She helped lead Stonehill College to an NE-10 conference title and an NCAA Division II Sweet 16 appearance in her sophomore season. Pfingstler finishing her college career with 797 points and 479 rebounds. Pfingstler, 26, died suddenly in 2003 in Pennsylvania, where she had made a home with her husband, Jude. ALAN RICH, Coyle-Cassidy Rich was one of the most talented athletes that came out of Coyle-Cassidy in the 1970s. He was All State in football (safety) and played quarterback. Rich lettered in football, basketball (guard), track (sprints 9.7 in the 100) and baseball (shortstop). He quarterbacked the varsity football team that became the 1970 State Class C co-champions. Rich went on to Boston University where he was the starting quarterback. MIKE SIMPSON, Coyle-Cassidy Throughout his high school career in the late , Simpson excelled in cross country and track while also playing basketball for the Warriors. He lettered in four varsity sports (cross country, basketball, winter and spring track) in just his senior year alone. Simpson set or had a hand in setting over 20 school records for track and field. He was the Division III State Champion in the Decathlon and was in the top five in the state for the 300m hurdles. Simpson was part of the team that broke a school record in the state relay. He capped off his senior year by winning the Massachusetts State Decathlon Championship. Simpson continued his track career at UConn during his freshman and sophomore years. BRUCE TEXEIRA, Taunton Texeira was considered the best basketball player to come from the city of Taunton in the 1960s. During his four years in a Tiger uniform, Texeira was the heart and soul of the team. A rival coach says: “Bruce is one of the best basketball players “ever to play in the Bristol County League, and in 1964, one of the best in Massachusetts.” Texeira was the first male basketball player in school history to record 1,000 points in his career. After graduating from Taunton High, he attended College of Holy Cross where he graduated in 1968. He enjoyed spending time with his grandchildren, coaching middle school basketball and vacationing with family and friends. Page 3 of 4 - Texeira, 65, past away in 2011. PRISCILLA TROJANO, Coyle-Cassidy It was truly an amazing high school career for Trojano The West Bridgewater native owns roughly 15 school track records at Coyle-Cassidy and she captured five Division IV titles in the hurdles, starting with a title in the winter 55-meter competition her sophomore year to landing a title her senior season in the 100 hurdles. She owns individual school records in the 50-yard hurdles (7.2 second), 55 hurdles (8.29), 60-meter hurdles (8.98), winter long jump (17-feet, 3-inches), spring long jump (16 feet), winter shot put (32-10), spring shot put (30-3), triple jump (34-9), spring high jump (5-feet), winter high jump (5-3), the individual pentathlon (3,281 points) and the individual heptathlon (4,058 points). Her performance in the individual state heptathlon earned her titles in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Trojano, an All-American, also won state pentathlon titles in 2006, 2007 and helped C-C claim the women’s heptathlon title in 2008 and defend its 2007 title in the pentathlon. She enjoyed a productive four years at Dartmouth College where she earned an indoor pentathlon title in 2010. GLEN TUFTS, Bridgewater-Raynham He was a natural at the plate. A threat to hit the long ball in every single at bat during his illusion career at B-R. Tufts was one of the most dangerous hitters in the 1970s and one of the greatest baseball players to come out of B-R. He was an all-state as a sophomore, junior and senior — the first since former Boston Red Sox star Tony Conigliaro. Tufts concluded his high school career with a batting average of .488, including a .565 mark in his sophomore season. He was selected fifth overall in the 1973 Major League Draft by the Cleveland Indians. Months after signing a MLB contract, a car accident derailed Tufts’ career. He played four seasons in the minors before leaving the game in 1977. Tufts worked as a scout for the San francisco Giants and runs a “Play Ball Baseball Camp” in Bridgewater. ERIN WADE, Taunton Her No. 9 Taunton High uniform will be forever remembered as being worn by one of the greatest softball pitchers in the program’s history. Wade currently holds eight Tiger single-season record — most wins (25), lowest earned run average (0.07), fewest runs allowed (six), fewest earned runs allowed (two), most decisions (27), strikeouts (332), innings pitched (189) antied for first with the most strikeouts in a game (20). She is first all-time in wins (67), strikeouts (942), no-hitters (12) and shutouts (51). Wade also threw three perfect games. Her 1.26 ERA is ranked second all-time and opponents batted just .110 against her over four years. She led the Tigers to their fourth Division I state title. What’s impressive about Wade’s career strikeouts numbers is that her closest competitor — Amy Kvilhaug — sits 502 Ks behind her in second place. Wade attended Hofstra University. BONNIE (YUEN) BELFIELD, Taunton When it came to middle distance, Belfield was simply the best in high school. Page 4 of 4 - The 1985 Taunton High graduate still holds the school record in the 800-meters (2.09.2), the 1000-meters (2.49.8) and the mile (4.57.1). Belfield was a four-year athlete for the Tigers in cross country and indoor and outdoor track and field. She was an eight-time state champion in the 800 and was undefeated in New England for three years. Belfield was a two-time New England champion in the 800 for outdoor track and five-time state champion in the 1000 for indoor track with a personal-best time of 2.33.2. She was also a two-time qualifier in the Millrose Games for the mile and member of the 1985 United States Junior National team. In college, Belfield competed at University of Missouri (Columbia) and was a seven-time Big Eight All Conference athlete. Most recently, she was inducted into the Massachusetts Track and Field Hall of Fame. DAVE AREITA, CARL FISHER and STEVE MEUNIER, Taunton High These three I witnessed growing up when I was a teenager. I call them “The trio”. All three played for Taunton High’s only Super Bowl team (1980) in school history. The undefeated Tigers beat Lynn Classical on that faithful day in the EMASS D2 Super Bowl, 21-0. Arieta, Fisher and Meunier were athletes with a lot of ability in high school. I couldn’t name one without leaving the other two empty-handed. Arieta, who played both ways and returned kickoffs and punts, was a leader in baseball, basketball and football. He was the starting tight end for the Tigers and even caught passes for touchdowns in the Annual Shriner game from Doug Flutie. Arieta was named Player of the Year by the Boston Globe. Meunier, who played four season of basketball and three seasons of football, was named MVP in the Super Bowl game. He was an all-league track and field star, placed second in the state decathlon and set the record for most points after touchdowns. Fisher came from a talented family and was a versatile athlete who played in many positions. My best memory of Fisher that made me love sports today was the seven touchdown effort scored in a Pop Warner, mud-filled game at Hopewell Park. That was special.
