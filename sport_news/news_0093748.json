(Photo: Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The number of teams on bye this week increases to four, but there are still more than enough matchups for fantasy owners to exploit -- as well as some to avoid.\nSTUDS\nWR Jeremy Maclin, Kansas City Chiefs: The Chicago Bears rank 10th in average points allowed to wide receivers. QB Alex Smith has perfected his connection with Maclin over the last two games, completing 19 of his 25 targets to him for 289 yards.\nRB Justin Forsett, Baltimore Ravens: Cleveland has allowed the most rushing yards to running backs per game (139.0) and the fifth-highest weekly fantasy points (PPR scoring) to backs. Forsett had three consecutive four-catch efforts before rushing for 150 yards against the Pittsburgh Steelers last week.\nQB Peyton Manning, Denver Broncos: Manning’s production has not matched his reputation, with more questions surfacing about his arm strength and Denver’s play-calling. Luckily, the Oakland Raiders are a top-five fantasy matchup for quarterbacks. They’ve allowed two passing touchdowns in every game, all against mostly immobile slingers, so Manning should direct things comfortably from the pocket.\nWR Jordan Matthews, Philadelphia Eagles: The New Orleans Saints have been fortunate to have faced three teams with limited wideout personnel. The Eagles have had issues through the air, too, but Matthews has not seen fewer than eight targets in any of his four games. With Sam Bradford coming off a growth week throwing the deep ball, that should change in Week 5.\nWR John Brown, Arizona Cardinals: After two mediocre performances, the wideout rattled off a solid seven-catch, 75-yard Week 4. He should have another productive effort against Detroit’s secondary, which ranks in the top 10 for PPR points allowed to wideouts.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 5 fantasy football rankings\nDUDS\nRB Jeremy Hill, Cincinnati Bengals: Anyone coming off a three-touchdown week is due to decline — unless your name is Devonta Freeman. Still, Hill runs into the brick wall that is the Seahawks run defense, which allows the second-fewest fantasy points per game to enemy backfields. Smells like a Giovani Bernard game.\nWR Calvin Johnson, Detroit Lions: Even in poor matchups, Megatron is still worth a flex spot, but Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson blanketed him last season (five catches, 59 yards). The Cardinals should pester Matthew Stafford and force him to settle for midrange gains throughout the day.\nRB Latavius Murray, Oakland Raiders: A fumble, a drop that led to an interception and a diminished role in a comeback attempt limited Murray in Week 4. Expect more of the same from the Raiders backfield — including more utilizations of Roy Helu Jr.\nRB Isaiah Crowell, Cleveland Browns: Coming off a week in which he gained 125 total yards, Crowell probably will take a back seat to pass-catching specialist Duke Johnson. The Browns will opt for him Johnson of trying to penetrate Baltimore’s front seven on the ground.\nQB Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks: Wilson’s feet will keep him on at least the back end of fantasy QB1 territory, and the Bengals have just two sacks this year. But Cincy’s defensive front will be a huge problem for Seattle’s struggling offensive line, which will keep Wilson under even more duress than the six-sack game Monday night. The Bengals’ suddenly standout cover corners should keep him guessing, too.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nFantasyScore podcast Week 5: Lonesome kickers, surprising receivers, more\nSLEEPERS\nQB Michael Vick, Pittsburgh Steelers: The San Diego Chargers' stellar numbers against quarterbacks paint a rosier picture than reality — they’ve allowed at least two touchdowns via the air in three of their four games this year. Vick completed 73.1% of his passes in the first game replacing Ben Roethlisberger. In his second, he will get a nice present with Martavis Bryant’s return.\nTE Owen Daniels, Denver Broncos: Daniels scraped together a touchdown on an otherwise disappointing Week 4. The Raiders have no idea how to cover this position, having allowed 26.7 fantasy points per game to tight ends — tops in the NFL. Daniels has 19 targets in his last three games, scoring in each of the last two. Losing Greg Olsen or Kyle Rudolph to byes? Here’s your replacement.\nRB Andre Williams, New York Giants: Since a fluke Week 1 stifling of Adrian Peterson, the San Francisco 49ers have opened the floodgates for running backs, allowing the sixth-most fantasy points per game to them. Most of the damage has come between the tackles, and Rashad Jennings only succeeded last week because of a flukish long TD reception. Williams fits the profile of DeAngelo Williams, Chris Johnson and Eddie Lacy, who had success up the gut against the Niners.\nWR Dorial Green-Beckham, Tennessee Titans: The Buffalo Bills have a good pass rush but their secondary has executed poorly. The Titans probably spent their bye week getting their rookie wideout more involved in the game plan. He already has found the end zone in back-to-back games.\nJacksonville Jaguars defense/special teams: The Jags boast an underrated pass rush, improved from last year. Tampa Bay's Jameis Winston threw four picks last week and has been sacked five times this year. Even if the points fly for both sides, Jacksonville should still reward fantasy owners with takeaways — the most important part of picking a defense.\nUSA TODAY\nWeek 5 fantasy football tips\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT ", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798381491664542-c06-fantasy-1008.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6df8d0a1c3353d8f96bbcc9e3e8d57c1eeda7709/r=300/https/i0.wp.com/usatfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/fspodcast-site-hero660x4501.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798381491664542-c06-fantasy-1008.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/56e6cac0c0460a51dc3a53c0cd1ce6e9f2361283/c=0-214-4220-2598&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798393848815754-USP-NFL-Detroit-Lions-at-Seattle-Seahawks-001.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LiL6xx&text=Fantasy%20studs%20and%20duds%3A%20Maclin%20making%20an%20impact&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4659ad4aaa6eb39c992388aa2a5daed383fb5c0b/c=333-0-4520-3148&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798381491664542-c06-fantasy-1008.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebc9519ac086054fa5092ba711393606fbfe81d3/r=300/https/i1.wp.com/usatfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/rob-gronkowski-new-england-patriots_0927151-e1444152947398.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LiL6xx&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:48:16.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
