The Indians have struggled to stop the run all season. Friday, they had to face a Bedford team that loves to run. The result was a 60-27 Tecumseh loss. “This was kind of a snap shot of our season right there,” Tecumseh coach Steve Robb said. “We have a pretty good football team, we have some fun on offense and we have a few playmakers on defense, but we’ve had a hard time stopping the run all year. We knew we were up against it coming in here tonight, and they did what we expected. They ran the ball, and they had success at it.” The Indians stayed close for most of the first half, trailing by just six points with 9:26 remaining in the second quarter. Mitch Meger’s 43-yard touchdown run in the first quarter made it 13-7, and Meger’s 45-yard pass from quarterback Jakob Coker cut Bedford’s lead to 20-14, before the Mules scored four unanswered touchdowns. “I thought we could hang in there with our passing game, and we did for a little while,” Robb said. “But eventually those big strong teams that run the ball well wear you down, and that’s eventually what happened.” Meger finished the game with 18 carries for 224 yards and caught one pass for 45 yards to lead the Indian offense. “That’s about his average,” Robb said. “He has about 1,600 yards in seven games; he’s having a heck of year. It’s hard for me not to hand him the ball every time. He had 47 carries in a victory over Ypsilanti this season, and we kind of realized we couldn’t give it to him quite that much.” Jordan Patterson caught a 14-yard touchdown pass from Coker in the fourth quarter, and Spencer Cowen made an athletic 8-yard catch for a score to make it 54-27. Tecumseh falls to 3-5 overall and will wrap up the season next week against Airport. “We lost a heartbreaker at homecoming last week with 11 seconds left that would’ve gotten us a share of the division title and kept us in the playoff hunt,” Robb said. “I thought it showed a little tonight that we weren’t quite as spirited as we have been. We have our senior night next week, and we need to play hard and finish 4-5.” Bedford lost its first four games of the season as a handful of players were suspended, but has been on fire since returning to full strength. Borrowing a phrase from former Michigan coach Lloyd Carr, Wood said that now it’s all about the “precious present” as Bedford heads into the final week of the season against a one-loss Detroit Country Day team. Page 2 of 2 - “Sure, it’s unfortunate and disappointing what happened (at the beginning of the season), but you can’t sit there and dwell in the past,” Wood said. “You have to keep these kids rolling and look on the bright side of things. Our bright side is that we can finish with a winning season with a big victory over Country Day.” Wood has guided the Mules to seven straight winning seasons since taking over the team in 2008. He hopes to keep the streak alive, and Friday’s dominating victory over Tecumseh was a step in the right direction. The Mules’ 60 points scored against the Indians were the third most in team history. Bedford scored 62 points in a win over Oregon Clay (Ohio) in 1995 and won 72-0 against Holland (Ohio) in 1958. “We won’t score 70 points,” Wood said. “I won’t let my team scored 70. Unless somebody scores 65.” Wood may not ever let his team run up the score, but it was clear his offense had the chops to get it done. The Mules outgained the Indians 593-448.
