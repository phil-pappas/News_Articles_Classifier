Clarkson, felled by an undisclosed lower-body injury, has not played in his club’s opening three losses and was ruled out of Columbus’ game against Ottawa on Wednesday, but there is a possibility he could return to the lineup in time to face his former team. \nClarkson went down with a season-ending injury upon being dealt to the Jackets last season and did not play when the teams met in the late stages of the 2014-15 campaign. \nThe Leafs’ road show continues in Pittsburgh the next night, and for the first time Sidney Crosby won’t be the main attraction. Not with Phil Kessel — the apparent Toronto problem child — in the lineup to face his old Leafs pals for the first time since his blockbuster departure. Kessel has a goal and an assist in three games with the Pens who, like the Leafs and Jackets, had yet to hit the win column entering Wednesday’s play. \nIt makes for a few juicy elements heading into back-to-back road tilts for the Leafs, who have been playing second fiddle to the Jays in terms of public interest for the first time in, well, perhaps, 22 years — the last time the Jays made the playoffs. \nBut just like former coach Carlyle, new bench boss Mike Babcock won’t put emphasis on anything — or anyone — beyond his players and a desire to win hockey games. \nClarkson Mania and Kessel Fever be darned. The in-it-for-the-long-haul Leafs have enough to worry about in-house and can’t afford to be dazed and distracted by the allure of going head-to-head with ex-mates. \nStill, that doesn’t mean they won’t be aware. \n“Playing with (Kessel) for so many years, it’s definitely going to be a little bit different,” Leafs forward Nazem Kadri said following a spirited practice in Etobicoke on Wednesday. “But as soon as that puck drops, it’s going to be like any other team.” \nLike any other team that just happens to boast some of the best players in the game (Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, etc.) and now Phil “The Thrill,” who put up 30-plus goal seasons in three of four seasons with the Leafs, finishing with 20 in a lockout-shortened campaign. \n“We’ve just got to try to be hard on him. Definitely give him a lot less time and space,” Kadri said of the reunion weekend highlighted by Kessel’s participation. “Try to get a body on him every time you can. He’s just such a special player and how he releases the puck is unbelievable. It’s definitely hard to catch him with his head down. But we’re going to have to find a way to do something.” \nAdded veteran Joffrey Lupul: “We got to see a different side of him than (the media did.) He was a fun guy to be around. He’s a friend of mine. He’s a friend of a lot of guys in here. It will be fun to compete against him.” \nNot surprisingly, the Leafs have sputtered out of the gate, earning just a single point through three games. Among the chief concerns for this young, rebuilding team is finding the back of the net on a consistent basis. But after recording just one goal in the opener against Montreal and being blanked in Babcock’s forgettable return to Detroit, a four-goal outing — and three-goal rally — did not equal a win against the Senators last Saturday. But it propelled the hosts to a shootout and provided evidence the Leafs are capable of scoring, if only by committee. \nThat has been helped by Toronto’s improved puck possession early on, and it’s what Babcock wants continually, along with effort. \n“There’s lots of keys to keeping the puck, but competing is part of it, for sure,” the coach said. “Our goal is not to play in the ‘D’ zone. Everyone talks about checking. Checking, if you do it fast, you always have the puck. That’s what we want to do. We want to have the puck all the time. Why? Because it’s more fun. \n“When you come in here every day and you compete and you’re honest with your effort and your teammates, it’s way more fun,” the coach added. “That’s the way life is. Sport mirrors life. If you put it all in every day at your job, you go home and you feel good about yourself. That’s just the facts.” \nWhile Clarkson’s involvement in Friday’s game remains to be seen, all eyes will be on Kessel on Saturday, including the Leafs’. \n“I’m a fan, too, so I want to see Phil do well (this season),” Lupul said. “It’s a great opportunity for him. They’re not off to a great start, but that team is going to get going. \n“It’s hard for you to believe, again, but Phil’s a fun guy to be around. He was fun in the locker room. He was fun at dinners,” Lupul added. \nAnd rather dangerous on the ice, too, as every player will attest. \n“We’ve got to watch what he can do,” Kadri said. “He’s a special player.” \nROBIDAS RETURN STILL UNCERTAIN \nWhat’s up with Stephane Robidas? \nNamely, is his NHL career in jeopardy? \nThe 38-year-old Maple Leafs defenceman appeared in just three pre-season games and has not been used in a regular-season game. According to a report from TSN’s Jonas Siegel published on Wednesday, Robidas, who has been plagued by injuries in the late stages of his career, sustained a strained knee on the morning of the team’s final exhibition game, which led to a groin injury, according to Leafs general manager Lou Lamoriello. \nThe severity of Robidas’ injury is not known, although Siegel’s report quotes the player’s agent, Pat Brisson, as saying his client was in “a lot of pain” during training camp, which ultimately became “unbearable.” \nIt is not clear where exactly Robidas fits in upon a return to full health, but assigning the Quebec native to the AHL Marlies is an option. Robidas has two years remaining on his contract with the Leafs, including this season. \nThe veteran appeared in 52 games with the Leafs last year, recording one goal and seven points to go along with 34 penalty minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:08:20.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
