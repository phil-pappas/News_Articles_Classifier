Proctor High School’s playoff football game against Syracuse’s Nottingham High School on Saturday did not end the Raiders’ season. It did end ugly -- four Nottingham players, including one who started the melee when he began punching star running back Jamarious Morgan from behind, and one Proctor player were ejected – with 1:54 still remaining in the third quarter and the Raiders leading 38-0 at D’Alessandro Stadium. But after order was restored and officials met with members of both coaching staffs, Proctor head coach Steve Strife said the athletic director from Nottingham did not want the game to continue, so the Raiders, now 7-1 overall, will be advancing to next week’s Section III Class AA semifinals. Proctor plays state-ranked No. 14 Christian Brothers Academy (7-1) of Syracuse at a neutral site and time to be announced on Sunday. CBA was a 41-14 winner over Fayetteville-Manlius in its quarterfinal game. “We did nothing wrong,” Strife said of Saturday’s game-ending brawl. “Our kids acted appropriately the whole game. Their coach (Nick Patterson) even apologized to me. He said, ‘I’m sorry coach. We don’t coach our guys that way.’ “I’ve never been involved in anything like this before. … Their A.D. just said it was over.” Morgan, who rushed for 142 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries, had just been tackled when a player not involved in the play pounced on him after the whistle and began punching him in the back of the helmet. “Proctor gets a bad rap sometimes,” Strife said when asked what triggered the fight. “But there is no doubt about it; their kid ran in there from 15 yards away and just started punching Jamarious. “It’s hard not to react in a situation like that. It was a melee. But we did a good job of controlling ourselves and I’m happy for our kids and our school and our community. I’m just glad it’s over and nobody got hurt.” Proctor’s DeJae Johnson ran for two touchdowns – he finished with 65 yards on eight carries – and sophomore quarterback Logan Wilcox threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Tony Graham. Graham also had an interception for the Raiders, whose only setback is a 35-34 loss to Baldwinsville. Nottingham’s Bulldogs (4-4), whose three regular-season losses were to three state-ranked teams – CBA, Liverpool and Elmira – had qualified for the playoffs with a four-overtime win over Corcoran last week. “I’m very disappointed; we don’t coach that up,” Nottingham coach Nick Patterson said of Saturday’s brawl. “It (stinks) when you have one or two bad apples who spoil the whole barrel. Page 2 of 3 - “I can take a win and I can take a loss, but you never want to do it that way.” Patterson confirmed that it was his athletic director, Richard Spicer, who “made the call” to end the game at that point. The coach also said he does not plan to appeal the ejection of his four players, meaning none of them will be eligible to play in a nonleague crossover next week. “Oh no, we won’t appeal,” Patterson said. “They were guilty. They will be disciplined.” The Bulldogs actually had a chance to take the early lead Saturday after driving to Proctor’s 4-yard line on the game’s first series, but Alvin Munjakovic recovered a Bulldog fumble at his own 11. Two plays later, Johnson’s 33-yard scamper and two 15-yard personal foul penalties on Nottingham led to a 16-yard touchdown run by Morgan. Proctor struck again late in the first period. Wilcox threw a 20-yard pass to tight end Gio Dixon, and Johnson swept right behind Chris Feliciano’s block for a 4-yard touchdown run. Feliciano’s two-point conversion run made it 16-0. The Raider defense then came up big, making a stand at its own 10-yard line and then forcing a punt. Another 33-yard run by Johnson and another 15-yard penalty on Nottingham set up a 15-yard touchdown run by Morgan, and Wilcox’s conversion pass to Graham made it 24-0 at the half. Graham’s interception on the first play of the second half was quickly followed by a 22-yard touchdown run by Morgan, who followed Johnson’s block on the perimeter into the end zone for a 30-0 lead. After taking over on downs at their own 24, Morgan shook free for a 26-yard gain and moments later, on 3rd-and-24, Graham caught Wilcox’s 43-yard bomb in stride and Morgan added the conversion run that made it 38-0 with 4:30 left in the third quarter. Nottingham was then stopped on fourth down and Strife said he was going to play his starting offense for one more series when Morgan was punched after a first-down run. “I knew something like it was possible, but I didn’t think it would happen,” Morgan said of the incident. “He just started hitting me.” It took a few very anxious minutes for cooler heads to prevail. “It was getting chippy,” Johnson said. “(Nottingham) didn’t have anything to play for and we knew they wanted to get some of our guys ejected. We just had to keep our heads, and not let anything dumb happen.” Follow @OD_Moshier on Twitter or call him at 792-5031.
