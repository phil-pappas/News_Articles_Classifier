I think guys are working their tails off.\"\nBrees completed 26-of-43 passes for 335 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday, but he also lost two fumbles on sacks and threw an interception. (New Saints tight end Michael Hoomanawanui had the fourth turnover when he was hit just after catching a pass and fumbled the ball).\n\"We better score 50 points if we're going to turn the ball over four times,\" Brees said.\nInstead, the Saints managed only 17, and the last touchdown as time expired padded statistics but was otherwise meaningless.\nBut Brees said the poor play wasn't a reflection of the locker room.\n\"I don't want to hear anything about youth. I don't want to hear anything about talent. I don't want to hear anything about anything other than what we have to do to win the game,\" he said.\nThe Saints (1-4) get only a short break before playing the Atlanta Falcons (5-0) at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on Thursday night.\n\"I love what we're capable of,\" Brees said. \"I think guys are doing a great job, guys are doing the right thing, guys are taking care of their bodies...We have great guys. We have great leaders and guys who want to do the right thing, who want to be great. So it's frustrating when you're sitting here at 1-4.\"\nBrees' optimism hasn't dimmed.\n\"We feel like we have the right pieces in place,\" he said. \"It hasn't come together yet, but it will.\"\nDrew Brees, 'This game should have been much closer.
