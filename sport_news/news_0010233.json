The deal went down – literally for 38-year-old Portland man Lawan Sanders and his girlfriend – after cops showed up and busted the would-be traffickers.\nReports The Associated Press on Oct. 19: “Court records show dispatchers overheard three men talking about selling drugs. They triangulated the call and officers arrived at the location to find three men standing by a car.”\nAccording to reports, on Sept. 27 Sanders and his girlfriend, Charity Fournier, traveled from Oregon to Idaho Falls in order to sell marijuana. Sanders was at a gas station speaking to two other men when he evidently sat down with his iPhone in his back pocket.\nThe unintentional call came through, and police were able to hear the trio talk about how to break up their large stash of hash and sell the pot in individual baggies. A few minutes later, cops rolled up in an unmarked car and placed the pair under arrest.\nAccording to the Idaho Post Register , Sanders had one bag of marijuana in his pocket and more pot stuffed into a prescription pill inside the vehicle. The men who met Sanders told cops he was going to sell them drugs from his hotel room; a search warrant was obtained, and investigators found half a pound of pot, close to three ounces of cocaine and eight grams of methamphetamine.\nSanders was charged with “possession with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance,” as well as “trafficking in cocaine or a mixture in excess of 28 grams but fewer than 200 grams” – which according to Idaho law carries a mandatory three-year prison term.\nThe other men were referred to the Bonneville County Prosecutor’s Office for charging decisions. Sanders was released on $50,000 bail. This crook will undoubtedly be the jail cell butt of the joke after calling 911 during his drug deal fail.", "external_links": ["http://bigstory.ap.org/article/police-say-suspect-accidentally-dialed-911-during-drug-deal", "http://www.postregister.com/articles/news-daily-email-todays-headlines/2015/10/15/cops-drug-suspect-dialed-911-during-deal"], "published": "2015-10-20T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:39:21.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
