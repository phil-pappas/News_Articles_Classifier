Additionally, today market is awaiting the economic data like CPI and IIP,\" said Vinod Nair, Head-Fundamental Research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.\nLupin, Cipla, Sun Pharma, TCS and Dr Reddy's too lost big time.\nThe stock of Bank of Baroda felt the heat as it ended 3.02 per cent down after CBI carried out searches three of its locations in New Delhi for an alleged forex violation of Rs 6,000 crore.\nHowever, metal stocks were in a sweet spot, which soared for the second day after Glencore said it will cut zinc output by a third, sparking a short-covering rally.\nVedanta gained 7 per cent while Hindalco rose 5.98 per cent.\nThe broader markets, however, saw some buying activity.\nThe BSE mid-cap advanced 0.15 per cent and small-cap ended higher by 0.01 per cent.\nMajor indices in Asia ended higher and Europe was trading lower in its early session.\nFrance's CAC and UK's FTSE were trading down by up to 0.56 per cent.\nMeanwhile, the buying momentum continued for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in October as they net bought shares worth Rs 483.86 crore last Friday, provisional data showed.\nAs many as 16 scrips out of Sensex's 30 ended lower.\n\"This is an intermediary reaction and India will get back to the global trend which is impressively getting positive in expectation of stimulus from China and ECB,\" added Nair.\nThe market breadth turned negative as 1,442 stocks ended in the red, 1,309 closed in the green while 118 ruled steady.\nThe total turnover dropped further to Rs 2,390.13 crore, from Rs 2,878.40 crore last Friday. â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:04:46.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
