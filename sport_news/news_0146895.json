Justice Revati Mohite Dhere directed the self-styled god woman to be released on bail of Rs 25,000, if arrested by the police. The court, however, did not impose any conditions while allowing the plea.\nIt stated, \"Considering the facts in the present case, no such conditions are required to be imposed.\" The prosecution's plea to direct Radhe maa to surrender her passport with the police was also turned down.\nWhile allowing the petition, the court primarily took into consideration the fact that Radhe maa was not a relative, as defined under section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and thus could not be booked for dowry harassment. Appearing for her, advocate Abad Ponda had pointed out that the petition filed before the family court in 2013 had not mentioned the allegations and they were added later in a private complaint filed in 2015.\nThe police also agreed with the court's suggestion that following the apex court order, Radhe maa could bot be prosecuted as she was not related to the complainant. The court had also raised questions about the claim of dowry sought by the in-laws and husband of the complainant, as no specific evidence was provided.\nThe police had filed a case against Radhe maa on August 5 for instigating the in-laws of a 32-year-old Borivli woman to harass her for dowry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:37:26.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
