Louisiana’s other quarterfinalist, Kay Daniel of Covington, also bowed out in the quarters. \nFollowing Thursday’s title match, a concluding championship presentation is scheduled between noon and 1 p.m. on the Squire Creek lawn and the public is cordially invited. \nAfter defeating Tonore, Shirley said, “I really enjoyed getting to know Ashley. She is a great person and a spectacular competitor. I felt I played well in our match and even though you get very defensive on these greens, I was able to give myself enough chances to make some.” \nTonore also had high praise for Shirley, the 29-year-old former Auburn standpoint. \n“She’s a great player and just keeps coming at you. I can see why she won last year and was runner-up the year before that,” said Tonore. \nShirley jumped out front on the second hole and was up by two after four before Tonore started whittling away, winning six and seven to square the match. But, as if to preview a continuing theme of the rest of the match, Tonore couldn’t put two consecutive winning holes together again. \nAfter hitting a great iron shot into seven to win that hole, the four-time LSU all-SEC pick came up short on her 8-iron into No. 8 and left there one down again. \nBoth ladies birdied No. 9 and then halved 10 before Tonore got even again at No. 11 thanks to perhaps her best approach shot of the day, a wedge to within three feet for birdie and a win. \nBut she followed that with perhaps her worst iron of the round on the par-3 12th, finding the hazard and losing to again go one-down. She never caught up again and eventually had bogeys on 15 and 16, ending the match. \nStill, Tonore had no difficulty stating her appearance at this national event was “a great time and a whole lot of fun. It was a good feeling to get back into the thick of tough competition and, honestly, I don’t want to go this long (10 years) before doing this again.” \nReminded that she was now qualified for next year’s U.S. Women’s Mid-Am Championship in Pennsylvania by virtue of her slot in the final eight of this year’s event, Tonore, 38, said, “I admit, that is something that sounds very appealing. \n“But the main thing I am thinking about right now is that we have soccer practice at 5,” a sentiment which vividly depicts golf for many women who are also serving in their primary role as a mom.
