The Oklahoma Department of Education released this year's report cards for all public schools, grading them on a scale from \"A\" to \"F\".\nIn Miami, no public school earned \"A's”. There were two \"B's,” two \"C's, two \"D's\" and one \"F\". The letter grades are based on student performance and student growth. The growth score combines the growth of all students in a school and the growth of students in the bottom 25th percentile of all students in the school. New Miami Superintendent Terry James says the formula is flawed.\n\"I would ask parents to view it as we are. Is it an indication? Yes it is. Particularly for your child get with your teacher and see how your child is doing on these achievement scores. I think that's what the parent is concerned about, how your individual child is doing. But also we would just ask you to keep in mind in that other hand, this isn't a particularly accurate assessment,” says James.\nThe US Board of Education and the State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister have also spoken out against the validity and reliability of the report cards. The new grading formula was mandated by a 2013 law.\nView the full list of scores.", "external_links": ["http://afreportcards.ok.gov/"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:55:30.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
