Now, after an off week, U.Va. gets into the conference grind against a Pittsburgh team coming off a dominating defensive performance in Blacksburg. U.Va. quarterback Matt Johns will have to unload the ball quickly to wide receiver Canaan Severin (team-high 23 catches for 298 yards and a touchdown) and running back Taquan Mizzell with Panthers defensive end Ejuan Price (two sacks at Tech) looking to get after him. If U.Va. can slow down running back Qadree Ollison, it might have a shot at rattling quarterbacks Nate Peterman and Chad Voytik, both of whom should play. U.Va., which is looking for its first takeaway of the season, will try to get its running game going behind a banged-up offensive line that will feature Jay Whitmire in his first start of the season at left guard. \nPREDICTION: Pittsburgh 27-13. \nWILLIAM AND MARY (2-2, 1-1 CAA) AT VILLANOVA (2-2, 1-0) \nSee the 2015 Christopher Newport University football season in pictures. \nWHEN: Noon. TV/RADIO: CSN/92.3FM, 107.9FM. \nWHERE: Villanova Stadium, Villanova, Pa. \nTHE SKINNY: It's official: Wildcats QB John Robertson, who came into his senior season with 10,274 total yards, is done for the season with a knee injury. So the offense is now in the hands of Zach Bednarczyk, whose first collegiate start came in Villanova's 24-13 loss to Penn on Sept. 24. He's completing 60 percent of his passes for 242 yards. The Wildcats, who are coming off a bye week, have been struggling to score (17.5 ppg). The Tribe had been strong defensively until last week's 24-23 loss to Delaware, in which the Blue Hens rushed for 353 yards. Tribe RB Mikal Abdul-Saboor's status remains uncertain with a sprained ankle, but Kendell Anderson has filled in nicely with 292 yards on 42 carries the last two weeks. QB Steve Cluley has 7 TDs and only 1 INT in 109 passes. \nSee William and Mary's 2015 season -- from the spring game through the fall season -- in pictures.

In its three games against Division I opponents, DSU has scored 32 points. The Hornets are averaging 1.8 yards per rushing attempt and completing 42 percent of their passes. Their defense is allowing 252 rushing yards per game. Hampton had 431 total yards in last week's 45-31 loss to North Carolina A&T.

Mixson has 500 receiving yards on 25 catches. \nPREDICTION: Hampton 34-21. \nCHRISTOPHER NEWPORT (1-3, 1-2 New Jersey Athletic Conference) AT KEAN (3-1, 2-1) \nWHEN: Noon. ONLINE/RADIO: cnusports.com/live, 99.1FM. \nWHERE: Kean Alumni Stadium, Union, N.J. \nTHE SKINNY: The Captains have lost three in a row but were more than just competitive in last week's 14-9 loss to 15th-ranked Rowan. CNU's defense shut out the Profs through three quarters and allowed only 139 total yards. Kean's Cougars already have won more games this season than they did last year. They have a tough runner in Damian Corredor, who has rushed for 438 yards and 4 TDs. Kean is averaging 5.2 yards per rushing attempt. QBs Tyler Rodriguez and Charles App have combined for 881 yards and 6 TDs through the air, 231 and 2 on the ground. CNU is averaging only 2.4 yards per rushing attempt. The Captains' best offensive player has been WR Taylor Loudan, who has 23 catches for 405 yards and 2 TDs. He's averaging 116.5 all-purpose yards per game.

Middle School. \nTHE SKINNY: The Builders showed signs of life in last week's 56-21 loss at unbeaten Washington and Lee. Dustin Hiner and Brenden O'Neil have each rushed for a pair of scores this season. Both of Hiner's TDs were last week, when he gained 194 yards. On defense, Travis Harris leads the Builders with 29 tackles. They're facing the Hurricanes, who are ranked 12th in the National Junior College Athletic Association. Louisburg is led by sophomore QB Darron Downing, who has thrown for 411 yards and three touchdowns. Though the Canes are unbeaten, their wins have come over Jirah Prep and three junior-varsity teams: CNU, North Carolina Wesleyan and Huntingdon. \nPREDICTION: Louisburg 24-20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:04:22.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
