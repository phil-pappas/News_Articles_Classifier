They reached No. 3 three times previously, including once last season. \nVoters spread first-place votes around to six teams in the Top 25 released Sunday. The Buckeyes received 27, down 11 (38) from last week. Baylor has 13 and Utah has 16. No. 3 TCU received three first-place votes and No. 5 Clemson and No. 9 Texas A&M each received one. \nOhio State started the season a unanimous No. 1, but as the Buckeyes have sputtered support has slipped. Ohio State pulled away from Maryland in the second half Saturday for a 49-28 victory. \nNow, there isn't much separation in the top four. The Buckeyes have 1,411 poll points, 21 more than Baylor. TCU is four points ahead of Utah. \nAssociated Press Top 25:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:33:43.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
