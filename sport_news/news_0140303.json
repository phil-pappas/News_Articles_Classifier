(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) By Justin Boggs Staff Writer \nSaturday’s Ohio State versus Indiana game drew one of the largest television audiences of the college football season despite it not being aired in primetime.Saturday’s contest gathered 7.3 million viewers, making it the sixth-most watched college football game of the season thus far on an ESPN network. It was the most watched non-primetime game of the season. The game kicked off at 3:30 p.m. EDT.Saturday’s contest was a back-and-forth affair that the Buckeyes pulled out a 34-27 win over the Hoosiers. Ohio State hung on as Indiana reached the Buckeyes’ red zone in the final minute of the game. Saturday’s game was the second most watched game on an ESPN network last weekend. The most watched game was between No. 6 Notre Dame and No. 12 Clemson. The contest only had 400,000 more viewers than Ohio State’s game in Bloomington. The most watched game of the season on ESPN's networks this season was Ohio State’s Labor Day game versus Virginia Tech. The game, which was broadcast on ESPN, had 10.6 million viewers.While college football has enjoyed increased ratings in recent years, thanks in large part to the College Football Playoff, the ratings pale in comparison to the ratings the NFL is drawing. Last week’s CBS Thursday Night Football game had 19.4 million viewers. Sunday’s NBC primetime game had 24.2 million viewers.
