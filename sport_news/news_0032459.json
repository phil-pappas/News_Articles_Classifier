It does not create a long-lasting negative consequence for the fish.The professional lake management professionals use proper equipment. They know how to do this. This is something that requires a professional. The purpose of electrofishing is to determine the growth, rate, weight, size, and abundance of the fish. By gaining statistics, it is possible to know how to proceed in improving the lake or waterway.An electrofishing survey can also be used to help decide if there are invasive species in a lake. Invasive species are non-native species that have no natural predators and can start taking over an ecosystem and destroy it. By removing invasive species, it helps improve the integrity of the ecosystem.The way it works is the fish are stunned. They are then netted and brought into a holding tank. After the professional has a chance to examine the fish and take statistics on it, it is returned to the water. However, sick and unwanted fish, such as invasive species, may be removed at that time.Electrofishing is used in private lakes and larger lakes such as Lake Tahoe and the Great Lakes. It has also been used in the Mississippi River. No matter what the size, this is a useful tool for lake management. Electrofishing is not dangerous for mammals that live near a lake.

Professionals have the right type of equipment. However, otherwise, electricity and water do not mix.Electrofishing surveys are the way to gain statistics in order to know how to take the necessary steps to improve a lake.   authors   http://LochowRanch.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:50:10.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
