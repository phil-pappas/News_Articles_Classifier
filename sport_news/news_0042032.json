We are carefully monitoring Bevo's condition at this time and will update the public as we find out more about his condition. The safety and well being of Bevo XIV is always our primary concern, and therefore he will not be attending the game on Saturday\" said Ricky Brennes, the executive director of the Silver Spurs Alumni Association, in a release. \nTexas plays Oklahoma this Saturday at 11 a.m. in the Cotton Bowl.
