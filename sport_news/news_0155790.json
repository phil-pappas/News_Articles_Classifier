Are you going to come back and fight, or are you going to whimper?’ And we didn’t whimper tonight. I’m very proud of them.” \nThe win was Lynden’s third straight after losing two of its first three to start the season. \nLynden receiver Jordan Wittenberg accounted for three touchdowns − two rushing and one receiving − Ben Colwell ran for a 51-yard score and quarterback Sterling Somers sealed the game with a 54-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run. \nSomers finished 15 of 24 for 174 yards and a touchdown. The senior also ran for 108 yards on 11 carries. Wittenberg led the Lions (4-2, 3-1 NWC) with six receptions for 69 yards. \n“It was a great test for us this week,” Wittenberg said. “They scored early, but we dug deep. We didn’t give in. Our team has so much heart, so much passion for the game. It’s unbelievable how hard our guys play.” \nLynden braved the work of Burlington-Edison running back Taran Lambert, who finished with 199 yards on 17 carries, in the first half to take a 14-13 halftime lead. \nThe Lions, during a key three-minute, third-quarter stretch, began to pull away. \nKrause set everything up with an interception off Burlington-Edison QB Hunter Anderson. Five plays later Wittenberg took a carry around the left side of a 3-yard touchdown, giving Lynden a 20-13 edge with 8:23 to play in the third. \nThen on the ensuing kickoff, Per Wolfisberg kicked short down the right side of the field. The ball bounced back, and Scarlett hustled down to recover it, giving the ball back to the Lions. \nTwo plays later, Somers connected with Wittenberg for a 20-yard touchdown strike to put the Lions in front 27-13. \nJust like that, the Lions were in firm command. \n“That certainly took the wind out of their team’s sails,” Kramme said. “There is no doubt about that.” \nBurlington-Edison kicker Jake Field converted a 37-yard field goal with 3:13 to go in the third to trim Lynden’s lead to 27-16, but Somers’ 54-yard TD dash down the left sideline, combined with a strong defensive effort, handed the Lions their third consecutive victory. \nBurlington-Edison", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:17:18.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
