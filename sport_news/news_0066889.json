It meant they went into the afternoon fourballs leading 7.5-6.5 after sharing the foursomes 2-2. \n\nSpieth may have looked a picture of calmness as he stood over the putt to win the match, but he revealed straight after he was anything but serene inside. \n\n\"Your blood is running, it's running through your hands. You know it's there,\" he said. \n\n\"Just looking at the spot just in front of the ball allows me to get over the tension in my hand and make a nice, solid stroke over that point. \n\n\"That was a great fight. And it was a huge point in the Presidents Cup.\" \n\nEarlier Branden Grace and Louis Oosthuizen continued their perfect run this week with a third win in a row, 3 and 2, over Patrick Reed and Rickie Fowler. \n\nOut first after an hour's delay to the start because of overnight rain, the pair took control with a birdie at the first hole in the alternate-shot format and were never behind. \n\nThe pair had little time for lunch and were quickly back out in the afternoon fourballs against Bubba Watson and J.B. Holmes. \n\nThe morning could have been even better for the Americans had Watson not lost his normally red-hot touch with the putter against Adam Scott and Marc Leishman. \n\nFirst the 2012 and 2014 Masters champion missed a seven-footer for par at the 16th to enable the Internationals to level. \n\nThen he missed an even shorter one to win the match on the final hole. \n\nLocal hero Bae Sang-Moon was involved in final green drama for the second day in a row. \n\nOn Friday he had holed a 12-footer to win his match as wild celebrations erupted. \n\nOn Saturday, he put his partner Hideki Matsuyama stone dead with his third shot to the par-five to secure a half against Bill Haas and Matt Kuchar. \n\n\"I was thrilled for both of us, \"said a grateful Matsuyama. \"We were one down and somehow we pulled it off.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:23:31.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
