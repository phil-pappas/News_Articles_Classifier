He had similar remarks when the 49ers were in the midst of a four-game skid earlier this season. \nThere have been scant personnel changes. On offense, guard Andrew Tiller has split snaps the last three games with Jordan Devey. Defensively, cornerback Jimmie Ward has seen a lot of action as the 49ers’ fifth defensive back. \nSchematically, there’s been a simplification on both offense and defense. The team isn’t blitzing as often as it did early in the season, especially with its safeties who mostly are falling back in coverage. Offensively, Kaepernick has started taking more snaps from under center than in the shotgun, which has been credited for getting him into a better rhythm and, in conjunction with play-action passes, has given him a bit more time to throw. \n“And we’ve had some up and then down,” Tomsula said when asked about the earlier adjustments. “We’ve got to get an uptick and keep going with it. That’s what we have to do.” \nAgainst the Seahawks, however, Kaepernick took one more snap from the shotgun than he did from center and he was sacked six times. He is on pace to go down 57 times this season, which would surpass by two the 49ers’ season record for sacks allowed.

Tomsula indicated that the injury was not serious. \nAfter the game, Kaepernick said the Seahawks simply had more intensity than the home team; Tomsula was asked why. \n“I thought there were spurts where the intensity, particularly in the second half, dropped,” he said. “And one time in the second quarter, and we were identifying that on the sidelines. People start to think and try to figure out what we’re doing – ‘What do I adjust? What do I fix?’ – and we’ve got to keep the intensity rolling while we’re doing those things.” \nMatt Barrows: @mattbarrows , read more about the team at sacbee.com/sf49ers .
