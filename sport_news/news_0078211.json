He told Golf Channel that he was preparing himself for the next six months of competition and future events, and felt it was appropriate to let his coaches and team know now. \nDeChambeau joined Jack Nicklaus, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Wood and Ryan Moore as the only players to win the U.S. Amateur championship in the same year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:14:56.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
