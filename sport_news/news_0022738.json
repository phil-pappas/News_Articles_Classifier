(Mark Tenally/Associated Press) \nRicky Jean Francois already bought his plane ticket to Miami. The bye-week relaxation plan was scheduled well before the Buccaneers arrived in town: The defensive lineman and his fiancee would enjoy a few days in his hometown with Jason Hatcher and his wife. Hatcher had even promised he’d be making some magic, which appears to be a euphemism for a different sort of sack. \nStill, if the Redskins hadn’t mounted the biggest comeback in team history, Jean-Francois was going to cancel the trip. (Don’t worry, he bought insurance.) \n“It just wouldn’t have felt right,” he said after Washington’s outlandish 31-30 win , the one that again had you glancing at the NFC East standings and the upcoming schedule. “I know it sounds weird, but I wouldn’t have made no moves. That game would have played back too much in my head. It would have just been too much. I’m serious.” \nYou know all those “just another game” truisms that are scattered throughout locker rooms, next to the Louis Vuitton bags and sweaty rags? They were missing on Sunday. Whatever color code you wanted to affix to this game, players were perfectly aware of what a loss would have meant. They were surprisingly frank about their post-break trip to New England to face the undefeated Patriots, about the implications of being two games out of the division lead entering the bye, and about the temperature around town had they lost a third straight game. \n“It would have been bad,” linebacker Will Compton said. “It would have been awful. I t’s all you would have thought about.” \n“I f we would have lost this game, that would have been the worst feeling ever,” said fellow linebacker Perry Riley Jr. \n“A very bad feeling,” lineman Chris Baker said, making Pierre Garcon laugh with his gentleness. “I didn’t want to curse,” Baker explained, before offering a non-family-friendly description. \n“Oh man, I don’t know if we were prepared for that,” Hatcher said. “There’s no telling what … it would have been a big hole going into the bye week.” \nHe stopped himself, but the bad possibilities go without saying. Maybe there wouldn’t have been drastic changes if the 24-0 deficit became a 48-0 loss, but there would have been a few inevitable consequences. Apathy in the stands. A loss of confidence in the men making the decisions. The fanbase’s wholesale abandonment of all those promises to be patient. The prospect of yet another late-season tailspin. \nDon’t forget, Washington’s cumulative record in the second half of the past two seasons is 1-15, the worst in the NFL. Since Joe Gibbs left town, the Redskins are 16-40 after the season’s midway point, better only than St. Louis and Cleveland. \nAround here, the football talk usually stops by the end of October, replaced by circus jargon and poop emoji. In 2010, Washington lost four of its first five games after the bye. In 2011, the bye devolved into a six-game losing streak. Washington closed the 2013 season with an eight-game losing streak, costing Mike Shanahan his job. Last year, the Redskins lost their first five games after their bye, sealing Jim Haslett’s fate. A loss to Tampa Bay on Sunday, with the New England Patriots looming, and you could already envision the annual December angst, the comically early mock drafts, the calls for firings and the sports-radio gimmicks. Remember last year’s coffin ceremony ? \nSunday’s comeback doesn’t guarantee those demons will stay away, but don’t tell the players that. Hatcher gathered the team in the locker room after the win and “ told them they’ve just got to believe that’s who we are, and that is who we are.” \n“ Th at’s us, that’s the [bleeping] Redskins,” he said, according to one player. \n“ He’s right. That’s how we’ve got to think,” Compton said. “When we do what we do, we’re a damn good football team.” \nAre they? As with most NFL teams, you could make the case either way. They needed a startling Philadelphia kicker malfunction and Sunday’s franchise-record rally to avoid a 1-6 disaster. But if Ryan Grant’s turf monster pal had stayed hidden in Atlanta, they also could be above .500 and tied for first. You can coulda-shoulda every NFL season into outlandish contortions, which is why players are now thinking things that would make even the HTTRest giggle. \n“We know in this locker room that we’re a good team, that we have what we need to go far, make it to the playoffs, Riley said. “And then when we get to the playoffs, it’s another season after that, but … “ \nHold up, hold up, bring it back, come rewind. What was that again? There was joy at FedEx Field after Sunday’s game. Tight end Jordan Reed high-fives fans on the way into the tunnel. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \n“I said in this locker room, we have what we need to get to the playoffs,” Riley repeated. “Once we get to the playoffs, it’s another season.” \n“Once we get to the playoffs?” That’s what Sunday’s win made possible: the belief that these players are coming back with some purpose grander than “try to get to six wins,” or “see if we can avoid farce.” \nInstead, there was Terrance Knighton, ticking off the reinforcements likely to join the team in New England and beyond: DeSean Jackson, Chris Culliver and Kory Lichtensteiger, to name three of the biggest. And there was Dashon Goldson, talking about his team playing “Redskin ball,” convinced that that’s actually a good thing. And there was Kirk Cousins, off the best performance of his career, talking about how much of this season remains. \nIn the past, that might have sounded ominous. It still might be. If the Redskins can’t rediscover their running game — they have just 135 yards on the ground in the past three weeks — or figure out how to stop the run — the past three backs they’ve faced have combined for 435 yards — they probably won’t be playing in January. If we’re being honest. \nBut this week wasn’t really about the playoffs; it was about remaining relevant. So when Compton plays video games with his brothers in Missouri, and Knighton hops on “ whichever flight leaves first after the team meeting,” and Baker enjoys a “babymoon” with his pregnant wife, and Hatcher makes his magic in Miami, they’ll know they’re coming back to a season whose vital signs continue to at least vibrate. Did they save their season? \n“I don’t know,” Jean-Francois said. “I just know we brought the team closer together with a win like this.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:35:42.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
