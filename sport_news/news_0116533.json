The five-time defending champion Titans have outscored league opponents 80-8 so far this season.\n“Every year we look forward to coming into league play and winning all the games,” said Strabel, a senior captain. “None of us wants to be the group that loses and breaks that streak. That drives us.”\nWith a showdown against unbeaten Lake Elsinore Lakeside looming, Temescal Canyon quickly took care of business against the Tigers. Nicholas Jannuzzi followed Strabel with two quick goals of his own and the Titans led 7-0 at the end of the first quarter. They poured it on until it was 17-2 going into the fourth quarter and the backups came in.\n“It was just really good execution on our part,” Temescal Canyon coach Damien Andrews said. “I truly believe it comes down to teams that make the fewest mistakes and execute the best and we did that.”\nStrabel and Jannuzzi finished with four goals apiece. Kyle Rasmussen added three goals and goalkeeper Gabriel Thorne made six saves before sitting out the fourth quarter. Overall 10 Titans players scored.\n“We were really focused,” Strabel said. “We came out strong and that took care of the rest of the game.”\nElsinore (9-14, 2-2) last year was Temescal Canyon's toughest test in league play, losing twice by a combined five goals, but couldn't mount a fight this time.\nWith offensive centerpiece Andre Sardary unavailable because he received a red card last game and only 10 active players, the Tigers failed to establish an offensive rhythm and tired quickly.\nBrian Defrates scored twice to lead Elsinore in its second straight loss by double digits.\n“Not having our best offensive player hurts, but my team still should not be getting beat as bad as we did,” Tigers coach Matthew Puig said. “We came out sluggish. Not having him is no excuse.”\nContact the writer: kglaser@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwlsjb-11.jpg",
