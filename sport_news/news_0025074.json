To put words in my mouth that I didn't say and to degrade my reputation and what I stand for, honestly, it's sickening to me. On top of that, just the fact that something inside the locker room gets out, honestly it gets me upset.\"\nThe controversy stems from an incident Saturday in London -- which was incidentally Joe Philbin's final practice as Dolphins coach.\nThe Miami Herald reported Monday that Tannehill grew angry when linebacker Chris McCain did something more aggressive than typical for a Saturday practice, saying something to the effect that he would prepare a scout team trophy for him.\nOther outlets also reported that he made a comment about a practice squad player's salary. That never happened, Tannehill insisted.\n\"I got upset,\" Tannehill acknowledged. \"I said nothing about a paycheck or anything close to that. I know everybody in this building works hard every single day, so I respect guys and I would never take a shot like that.\"\nTannehill added: \"Am I happy about everything I said? No. The way things went down? No. But I hold myself to a higher standard than to take a shot at someone like that, especially guys that I work with everyday and I respect how they go about their business.\"\nCenter Mike Pouncey backed up Tannehill's version of events, calling the report \"1/8expletive3/8.\"\nPouncey added: \"He doesn't deserve that.\"\nThe dust-up was just the latest in a long line of leaks that undermined Philbin and his coaching staff and gave the impressive of a team in disarray.\nThat needs to stop, Tannehill added.\n\"Someone's leaking, obviously,\" Tannehill said. \"I don't think it's a huge problem where everyone's running to say everything that happened here, but I'd like to think as a team, when something happens in this building or out on the practice field, whatever it may be, that we protect each other and represent each other well. The fact that someone's airing out our dirty laundry from within, it's a bad feeling.\"\n(c)2015 Miami Herald\nVisit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1734181&h=Dolphins+QB+Ryan+Tannehill+insists+he+never+taunted+teammate+over+%27paycheck%27", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1734181&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1734181"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:14:10.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
