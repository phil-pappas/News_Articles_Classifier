Bears won 22-20. By KEVIN FISHBAIN — kfishbain@chicagofootball.com \nCHICAGO – Bears coach John Fox and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio decided to have a 29-year-old corner in his second start since 2013 and first as a Bear follow the Raiders’ biggest threat around the field Sunday afternoon. \nAnd it worked. \nTracy Porter helped the defense hold Raiders receiver Amari Cooper to four catches for 49 yards in the Bears’ 22-20 last-second victory. \nPorter, who said this was the first time in his NFL career in which he was asked to follow an opposing receiver, found out late in the week he might be starting for Alan Ball, who was limited in practice with a groin injury. \n“Coming into this week, I was locked in and ready to go and preparing like they were going to call my number,” he said. “They did call my number and I was ready to go out there.” \nCooper’s biggest play – a 26-yard touchdown – came from the slot when Sherrick McManis was in coverage. When he lined up outside, Porter was opposite him. \nFox knew Porter from Denver and Bears general manager Ryan Pace from New Orleans. Even though a hamstring injury kept him out most of the preseason, the Bears kept Porter on the roster and had the confidence to put him in a big spot. \n“I can’t really put it into words. They believed in me,” he said. “Not taking anything away from the other guys in our secondary – Kyle (Fuller) did an excellent job covering [Michael Crabtree]. He didn’t have any balls over the top. We were feeding off at other throughout the game. \n“For me to follow Amari around, it’s just what they asked me to do. I was like, ‘If that’s what you want, I’ll do it, coach.' \" \nClutch as Gould: Robbie Gould’s 54-yard field goal 13 minutes before his game-winner gave him a little advantage. \n“My routine today was kick it to the right upright and I knew it’d fall,” he said. “I think the kick before kind of helped seeing that too, it was the same kind of hash.” \nGould praised offensive coordinator Adam Gase for getting the ball to the left hashmark, and Gould was happy to kick south. \n“I love that end zone, because that’s the wind I’m used to,” he said. “I think I’ve hit all my game-winners at that end.\" \nNext safety up: Undrafted out of the University of Findlay, Harold Jones-Quartey got the call in the third quarter to step in with the starting defense after Antrel Rolle injured his ankle. \n“You hate to see it, a guy like Rolle – a team leader, a team captain – go down, but it’s the next man up,” he said. “When I hear my number called, I’ve got to go out there and do whatever it takes to help the team win.” \nDefensive backs coach Ed Donatell pulled Jones-Quartey aside during a TV timeout, and the rookie said Donatell was reminding him to stay calm. Rolle, who watched the game from the sideline in the fourth quarter, told Jones-Quartey to watch for the play-action to the H-back. \n“Harold had to go in there and take my place and I think he did an exceptional job,” Rolle said. \nInjury update: Fox said Will Montgomery has a broken fibula, which likely ends his season. Rolle said that X-Rays on his ankle were negative.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:44:10.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
