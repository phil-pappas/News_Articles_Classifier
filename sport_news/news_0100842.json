The game was played before a season-high crowd of 1,624 fans on Homecoming Weekend. Fernandes, who is on the Hermann Trophy Watch List, took a pass from Jay Marchand and got behind the Bearcat defense. The goal was his team-best fourth of the season. Binghamton finished with a 10-6 shot advantage. The two teams each had three shots in the opening 45 minutes. The Bearcats controlled play for most of the second half but could not find the back of the net. \"I thought our guys played hard tonight but we are disappointed with the result,\" head coach Paul Marco said. \"UMass Lowell played well and every time we attacked, they had a lot of players behind the ball.\" The game featured a pair of Hermann Trophy Watch List candidates. Junior goalkeeper Robert Moewes finished with a pair of saves for the Bearcats. At the other end of the field, Austin Kroll made five saves to record the shutout. Binghamton travels to New Hampshire on Wednesday for a 7 p.m. game.
