No insurance, no license and the heartache of knowing that I hit somebody? We’re trying to clean that up in the Commonwealth and in our city,” Gomes said. \nWard Five Councilor Kerry Winterson says he can’t believe there currently aren’t any insurance requirements for these operators. \n“If you hit my truck, how am I going to recoup that money to get my vehicle repaired? Grab the scooter and throw it in the back of my truck and go to a scrap yard so I can get somewhat of my repair money back?” Winterson asked. “That one always fascinated me.” \nThe Council agrees that laws currently on the books needs to be reworked before more people get hurt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:01:33.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
