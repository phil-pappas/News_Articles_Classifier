We can’t dwell,” coach Bruce Arians said. “They (fans) have to go work and cry, and rightfully so, until they get another win. Drink a lot of beer. We don’t have time to worry about that last game. It’s over, or it’ll linger into the next one.”\nAZCENTRAL\nCardinals XTRA app: Get the latest news, analysis, scores, more\nBoth the Lions and Cardinals suffered losses that could linger.\nThe Lions lost at Seattle in the final seconds when officials let the Seahawks illegally bat the ball out of the end zone. NFL officials quickly acknowledged the mistake but could do nothing about the Lions falling to 0-4.\nThe Cardinals lost to the Rams after a promising drive ended in the final minutes.\n“After a certain point, you’ve just got to stop talking about it,” Lions coach Jim Caldwell said. “After the game was over with, it was done, and we moved on. Nothing you can do about it. It doesn’t help you to lament or anything of that nature. It may make you feel good for a moment, but it doesn’t make any difference in the grand scheme of things.”\nCoaches can make turning the page on a loss sound as easy as swiping the screen on an iPad. But it’s easier said than done, and it’s often impossible for fans.\nActor Jeff Daniels is an avid Lions fan. Appearing on ESPN to promote his new movie, \"The Martian,\" Daniels sounded as if man will land on Mars before the Lions turn things around.\n“You feel cursed,\" he said. \"It’s just part of being a Lions fan. And it’s just painful. I don’t care what the Cubs fans say, this is more painful.”\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Cardinals at Detroit Lions: TV, radio information\nPainful losses, the kind that can pivot the direction of a season, are more difficult to get over.\nArians admitted that coaches can do only so much.\n“I think there’s a 24-hour rule. When your veterans come in Wednesday to go to work, your young guys will follow them,” Arians said. “This is a time for your leadership to stand up, and if you have really good leadership, you won’t lose two in a row.”\nThe Cardinals lost consecutive games three times in Arians’ previous two seasons: once early in 2013 and twice last year. It’s not a coincidence the Cardinals won 21 games in his two seasons, tying a franchise record for victories in consecutive years.\n“We came into today with the right mindset,” quarterback Carson Palmer said on Wednesday, “from the attention to details this morning, to sticking around after practice and going through some stuff. We’ll be ready on Sunday.”\nAZCENTRAL\nA look at the Arizona Cardinals through 4 games\nPalmer views Sunday’s game in Detroit as a test of the Cardinals’ mettle.\n“You never want to lose, but it’s a challenge coming back,” he said. “We’re going to a tough environment against a team that doesn’t have a win yet. It’s a tough environment and we’re going to see what we’re made of.”\nLike Palmer, Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford said his team has moved on from Week 4, something it had to do quickly after playing on Monday night.\n“If you do that, take a little bit of extra time, you’re going to find yourself in trouble, especially when you play a good football team like Arizona,” Stafford said.", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b00615862fcdcaa95c8725018cfd2e8df0c2203/c=401-0-3365-2964/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635797601670104140-mathieu.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f89bf431af289a4b8e1be19fdd8037f0883e6db5/c=692-0-3444-2752/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798393767071230-USATSI-8829977.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f486957480d22f176e3cd34a46e369581131499c/c=258-0-1794-1536/local/-/media/Phoenix/None/2014/10/03/1412378318000-cards-xtra-app-promo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:10:22.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
