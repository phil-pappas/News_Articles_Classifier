WAYNE — The chants hailed down from the boisterous Crusaders Crazies as their team assembled in victory formation Friday night at DePaul.\n“John-ny Foot-ball,” the student section chanted over and over, voicing their appreciation for sophomore signal-caller Johnny Langan, who made his presence felt more on the ground (12 rushes, 90 yards, two TDs) than through the air (3-of-12, 57 yards) It wasn’t the most dominant offensive performance Bergen Catholic has had this season — playing its first game since Jarrett Guarantano’s potentially season-ending injury — but Langan and the Crusaders got the job done in a gritty, hard-fought 15-13 win over DePaul.\nHis team trailed, 7-6, at halftime, but Langan orchestrated a key seven-play, 65-yard drive midway through the third, including a 46-yard bomb to Korab Idrizi (on third-and-19 at BC’s 26) and 13-yard touchdown run to put BC up, 12-7, with 5:48 left in the quarter, a lead it would not relinquish.\nOn BC’s following possession, following a DePaul three-and-out, Langan broke a 48-yard run on a third-and-1 to set up Michael Kearney’s 21-yard field goal and put the Crusaders up, 15-7.\nThe offense struggled for much of the night, but Bergen Catholic made more plays when it mattered, most in the second half, to improve to 4-2.\n“I don’t think I’ve ever had a better feeling than I have right now,” said Langan, who split time with junior Patrick Holly at quarterback. “This was a big game for me even before being named quarterback with Pat. In my hometown, on ESPN, what a night.”\nThe highlight of BC’s eight-play, 55-yard scoring drive in the first half came from Holly, who fired a 31-yard strike down the right sideline to Idrizi.\nTwo plays later, Langan rumbled in from 1 yard out, though the Crusaders’ ensuing two-point conversion was unsuccessful, to give BC a 6-0 lead.\nDePaul’s Hasise Dubois hauled in a well-placed, 5-yard fade pass to the end zone, out-leaping the Bergen Catholic defender, from Shelton Applewhite with 3:50 left in the first half. Following Ryan Simon’s successful point-after attempt, the Spartans led, 7-6. Four plays earlier in the drive, Applewhite and Dubois hooked up for a 30-yard connection to bring it into Bergen Catholic territory.\nKareem Walker, who sat out the majority of the first quarter for unspecified reasons, rumbled 22 yards in between the pair of Dubois catches to give the Spartans possession at the BC 5.\nDePaul’s lone touchdown drive of the first half came on the immediate possession following the Crusaders’ first touchdown. Trailing, 15-7, in the fourth, DePaul made things interesting when Walker rumbled in from 5 yards out to bring DePaul within two with 9:06 left. The Spartans’ ensuing two-point conversion to tie the game, however, was unsuccessful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:49:17.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
