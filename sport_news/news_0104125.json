Penn State coach James Franklin greets wide receiver Chris Godwin (12) and quarterback Christian Hackenberg as they jog off the field after a touchdown in the first half against Maryland on Saturday. (Patrick Semansky / AP) The Penn State report card after a 31-30 win over Maryland \nOFFENSE: B-. Sloppy though they were, Lions deserve credit for taking (and hitting) so many plays downfield. Receiver Chris Godwin is a budding star. \nDEFENSE: B-. Sloppy though they were, Lions shut down Terps four times in 4 t h quarter with the game on the line. \nSPECIAL TEAMS: C. Punter Daniel Pasquariello was much better, and Nick Scott had several good kickoff returns (though he did fumble). \nCOACHING: B-. Offense reacted well to the run-stopping defensive fronts Maryland brought. Defense struggled with a running QB but forced five turnovers. \nOVERALL: B-. A big, fat sloppy win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:50:58.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
