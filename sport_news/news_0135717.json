Leonard Fournette can auction his jersey for SC flood victims. â€” NCAA (@NCAA) October 11, 2015 \nWearing the jersey, Fournette has made LSU history by getting to 1,000 yards in a season faster than any other player. The Tigers have only played five games so far, three of which Fournette had consecutive 200-plus yard games making SEC history. \nThe New Orleans native's home was destroyed in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. \nThe plans for the auction have not been made yet. \nCopyright WAFB 2015.
