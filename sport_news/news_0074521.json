TV: Ch. 8. Radio: KRLD-AM (1080), KKGM-AM (1630); LINE: OU by 16.5\nTexas (1-3, 0-1 Big 12) vs. Oklahoma (4-0, 1-0)\nThe Longhorns will win if ...\nThey have put all the turmoil of the past week behind and are focused on Oklahoma, not Twitter and turf battles in the locker room. The offense begins with quarterback Jerrod Heard. Since setting a Texas total offense record against Cal, he's p roduced just 238 yards total offense combined against Oklahoma State and TCU. D'Onta Foreman needs to get yards on first down to take the pressure off Heard. The defensive front must at least play the Sooners to a standstill.\nThe Sooners will win if ...\nThey simply take care of business. On offense, defense and special teams, Oklahoma is simply better. With each game, it looks like the Sooners are getting more comfortable with the new offense. Coming off a monster game against West Virginia, expect linebacker Eric Striker to be a nightmare in the Texas backfield. What could go wrong? Well, there's always the possibility of complacency. The upperclassmen still remember the out-of-nowhere loss to Texas and Case McCoy in 2013. They should be ready.\nSPOTLIGHT\nOU Air Raid versus Texas secondary\nMore than a few people questioned Baker Mayfield's sanity when he transferred from Texas Tech to Oklahoma, sacrificing a year of eligibility in the process. \"He grew up an Oklahoma fan and at the end of the day that's where he wanted to play ball,\" said Texas center Taylor Doyle, a former high school teammate of Mayfield at Lake Travis. \"A lot of people looked at him and said it's crazy. But he saw an opportunity and took it.\" Instead, he's been more productive in his first four starts than Sam Bradford. Possessed with a gunslinger mentality, Mayfield was the right fit with new offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley. Mayfield has a bunch of talented receivers led by Sterling Shepard. Texas' combative but young secondary look overmatched against TCU's Josh Doctson and KaVontae Turpin and blew a couple of coverage assignments.\nHOW THEY MATCH UP\nWhen OU runs\nThe Sooners aren't running as much in the Air Raid and rank seventh in the Big 12 at 163.5 yards per game. After a slow start, sophomore Samaje Perine is averaging 108.5 yards per game in OU's last two games. He's reached the 2,000-yard mark quicker than any player in the Bob Stoops era. Joe Mixon brings big-player ability and is averaging 5.0 yards per carry. Texas will need a big effort from defensive tackle Hassan Ridgeway. Advantage: Oklahoma\nWhen Oklahoma passes\nBaker Mayfield showed his mettle leading Oklahoma back from a 17-0 deficit against Tennessee on the road. He's completing 65.2 percent of his passes with 13 touchdowns and three interceptions. While not a true dual-threat quarterback, Mayfield does bring elusiveness and can extend plays with his mobility - although Texas has recorded just seven sacks in five games. Eight different Sooners have caught passes. The Longhorns have allowed 1,483 yards and 16 TDs. Advantage: Oklahoma\nWhen Texas runs\nIf the Longhorns have any identity on offense, it might be the running game. Jerrod Heard has been explosive, especially on broken plays and quarterback plays. But his numbers have dropped lately as teams have gotten a better handle on his tendencies. Texas continues to split carries between senior Johnathan Gray and sophomore D'Onta Foreman, who is coming off his first 100-yard rushing game. The offensive line has struggled without right tackle Kent Perkins (knee). Advantage: Oklahoma\nWhen Texas passes\nJerrod Heard ranks ninth in the Big 12 in passing efficiency. The Texas passing game has been limited to short throws or deep shots down the field without much of an intermediate passing game. Daje Johnson, the one playmaker at receiver, is not expected to play due to a head injury. John Burt and Marcus Johnson must step up at receiver. Oklahoma ranks second in the Big 12 in pass efficiency defense and has recorded 13 sacks in four games. Advantage: Oklahoma\nSpecial teams\nFreshman Austin Seibert has been a find for Oklahoma. He's made all seven field goal attempts and is averaging 45.2 yards a punt. Of his 21 punts, nine have been downed inside the 20. Texas coach Charlie Strong opened up the kicking competition after Nick Rose missed two field goals against TCU. Freshman punter Michael Dickson has been inconsistent. Advantage: Oklahoma\nFOUR DOWNS KEYS TO TODAY'S GAME\n1. Sooners most seize momentum\nThe Longhorns are 0-10 under Charlie Strong when the opponent scores first. Especially this season, Texas has not reacted well to adversity. While it's been a recurring theme throughout the season, it was especially pronounced in the 38-3 loss to Notre Dame and the 50-7 defeat against TCU. Against the Horned Frogs, a Daje Johnson fumble on a hard hit early led to a 30-0 first-quarter deficit. Oklahoma hasn't exactly been a quick-starting team, even with the Air Raid offense, outscoring opponents just 27-13.\n2. Texas not-so-special teams\nIn the past three games, Texas has missed a potential game-tying extra point, shanked a punt for minus-10 yards and snapped the ball over the punter's head. At this rate, the mistakes have become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. It may be too much to ask Texas for a complete turnaround. But if the Longhorns can avoid catastrophic game-turning failures, that would be a major step forward.\n3. Getting off the field.\nWhat happens on the field for the Texas defense, stays on the field. And stays ...and stays. Few teams in the country are worse at getting defensive stops than the Longhorns. Texas has allowed 144 first downs in five games, the highest total in the FBS. Third-down conversion defense is 122nd nationally. Opponents have scored on 23 of their 25 red-zone drives. As for OU, the Sooners are averaging 8.2 yards on first down.\n4. New quarterbacks adjusting\nThe AT&T Red River Showdown is unique among regular-season games because of the seating split at the 50-yard line. At most games, there are periods of noise as well lulls. At the Cotton Bowl Stadium, it's pretty much non-stop from one fan base or the other. Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield and Texas counterpart Jerrod Heard are making their first starts in the series and must deal with the range of emotions that go along with the noise.\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:34:25.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
