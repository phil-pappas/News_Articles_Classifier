Price is hard to miss on the field. \nLast Friday night, the left tackle helped lead Archers’ offense to a 56-6 win over Shiloh. Price is one of the best players in Georgia and he’s now earned himself a spot on Team11’s Starting Eleven roster. \n“It feels great,” Price said. “It feels great to win Player of the Week. I owe it to our coaching staffs and my teammates. They’re the best. So you know, I couldn’t do it without them. I go out there and I do my job but it really goes to my team.” \nThe senior Tiger said his success is a team effort. \n“My coaches - they play a great part in it,” he said. “They prepare us mentally and physically. My teammates, they’re great teammates. They allow me to compete every day and just go out and give my best. You know, when I got Jamyest [Williams] and Dylan [Singleton], and other playmakers. Kyle [Davis] on the field, making big plays behind me. It’s kind of easy to just go out there and do my job.” \nThe Archer Tigers lost to Grayson early in Week 4. But since then, the Tigers have won every game, outscoring their opponents 185-23. According to Price, there’s still work to be done. \n“We took a loss to Grayson a couple of weeks ago, we got a lot of wins after that,” he said. “I still have that sour taste in my mouth. But we definitely are clicking, now I feel like we’re definitely getting to the point where we want to be. I feel like we still haven’t reached our full potential yet, but I believe we’re just going to keep working until we do.” \nPrice was committed to UGA, but has since reopened the recruiting process. He has offers from over 30 schools including Auburn, Tennessee, Michigan, Michigan State and Florida State. \nArcher takes on Central Gwinnett Friday night at home for the Tigers’ homecoming.
