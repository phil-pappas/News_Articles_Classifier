A few teams jumped multiple spots, some fell out of the rankings all together, while only two remained in the same spot as their Sept. 16 ranking. District tournaments begin Oct. 7, with the state championships held Oct. 23-24 at Killian in Springfield. As with all of our other power rankings, these are based on dominance by Class, not head-to-head. It's the \"pound for pound\" best teams in the Ozarks. SEPT. 16 RANKINGS Just because a team is ranked in the Top 5 doesn’t necessarily mean they’d beat a team ranked 8-through-15. Overall record, Class level and previous ranking are in parenthesis. Current overall records are as up to date as I could find. 1. Republic (22-2, C4, PR: 1) – A rare Republic loss opened the door for another team to take the top spot, but it was really an up-and-down week for most teams in the Top 8, so Republic remains at No. 1 for now. The Tigers lost 4-3 to Lee’s Summit North in the title game of the Springfield Invitational, a game Republic led 3-0 after five innings . Republic ace Rachel Rook was shutting down LSN, not allowing a hit until the bottom of the sixth inning in that game. The Broncos entered that game having scored 39 runs over their first four games in the tournament. Rook was pitching her sixth game in three days, and coach Lee Dishman said fatigue finally became a factor. Republic won’t have to worry about that workload on Rook come districts and the postseason. If she’s that effective against a very good LSN team on no rest, you have to like Republic’s chances in districts and beyond. Lee’s Summit North, by the way, is 19-6 overall and in a district that includes: Lee’s Summit (20-6), Lee’s Summit West (18-7) and Raytown (13-9). The way the state bracket is set up, the winner of District 14 (LSN’s district) could face the winner of District 12 (Republic’s district) in the Class 4 state finals, so we may see Republic get another shot at LSN before it’s over. Republic finishes the regular season with home games against Branson (Sept. 30), McDonald County (Oct. 1) and a trip to Rogersville (Oct. 5). 2. Norwood (15-6, C1, PR: 3) – With victories over Seymour (15-0) and Bakersfield (11-1) this week, Norwood locked up a Summit Conference championship and will finish the regular season with no losses to a Class 1 school. Dora has the better winning percentage, but I think the Pirates will get the No. 1 seed for the Class 1, District 2 tournament thanks to a better strength of schedule. Norwood’s won two of three meetings with Morrisville this season, including a 7-4 win at home in extra innings last Friday. Norwood also played Willow Springs to a 2-1, extra-innings loss Sept. 24. Junior Jenna Ogletree continues to light up opposing hitters. She’s hitting .453 with 6 homers, 29 RBIs and a .828 slugging percentage. 3. Pleasant Hope (13-6, C2, PR: 4) – I kept switching Pleasant Hope and Bolivar back and forth in the 3-4 slots, before finally settling on the Pirates at No. 3. Both had multiple losses over the last two weeks, but in Pleasant Hope’s case, its Class 2 losses came against potential district title winners Iberia (17-3 overall) and Sherwood (16-3 overall). Pleasant Hope also had a good showing in makeup games at the Buffalo Tournament, playing Camdenton (5-3) and Rogersville (7-4) to close losses. I’ll admit that it’s kind of weird to boost Pleasant Hope up a spot considering they recently lost to two good teams in their own Class, but looking over teams in the 4-8 range, most everyone has had multiple losses of late. I didn’t want to suddenly bump a team up six spots. Pleasant Hope trounced Lamar, Dora and Summit Christian Academy at its own tournament last weekend – a stretch coach Kevin McVey called his team’s best play of the season – before losing to Sherwood in the finals. Pleasant Hope’s bats erupted last night in a win over Morrisville , as the Pirates hit double-digit runs for the eighth time this season. Pleasant Hope hosts Willard for Senior Night on Thursday, travels to the Carthage Invitational this weekend, then plays at Carthage on Monday, Oct. 5 to close the regular season. 4. Bolivar (18-7, C3, PR: 2) – It’s been a busy, up-and-down two weeks for the Liberators. After beating Rogersville at home Sept. 15, Bolivar went on to lose 6-5 at Monett on Sept. 17 and 1-0 at Warrensburg on Sept. 21. Between that, the Liberators went down to Branson and won the Branson Tournament on Sept. 19, with wins over Hillcrest, Cassville, Branson and Kickapoo. Bolivar collected conference wins over Marshfield (Sept. 22) and Buffalo (Sept. 23). Bolivar went 2-3 at the Springfield Invitational last weekend, with victories over Ponca City (Okla.) and Marshfield, and losses to Nixa, Eldon and Joplin. This week’s started off well, though, with wins over Ozark (6-4) and Hollister (16-0). Whew. That’s a lot of softball over a two-week span for the Liberators. Bolivar plays at Camdenton on Thursday and hosts Branson to close the regular season Monday, Oct. 5. Despite that loss to Eldon, Bolivar’s locked up the 1-seed for next week’s Class 3, District 10 tournament , where a rematch with Eldon could happen in the semifinals. 5. Crocker (16-3, C1, PR: 9) – The Lions look to be a legitimate postseason contender in Class 1. Crocker is currently one of the hottest teams in the area, winning nine of their last 10 games, including a 4-1 win over Iberia (17-3 overall) on Sept. 15. Crocker also beat Dixon at home Tuesday, 5-2, avenging an earlier loss to the Bulldogs and clinching the Frisco League regular season championship . Crocker’s three losses have come to non-Class 1 teams: Class 4 Waynesville (7-4), Class 3 Osage (3-1) and Class 2 Dixon (5-2). In that Tuesday win over Dixon, Crocker pitcher Delayne Patton gave up one earned run on two hits and three walks while striking out 10. For the season, she’s 13-3 with a 1.18 ERA and 159 strikeouts to 56 walks, while hitting a team-high .491 with 17 RBIs at the plate. A four-spot jump in the rankings is pretty significant, but the Lions have earned it. They beat St. Elizabeth 4-2 on Sept. 24 – a team that’s given them trouble in the past – to lock up the 1-seed for next week’s Class 1, District 3 tournament . Crocker’s the only team in that district that currently has a winning record. If Crocker wins its district, we could have a Crocker vs. Dora/Norwood quarterfinal matchup. Crocker plays at St. James on Thursday then finishes the regular season in the Rolla Invitational this weekend. 6. Dora (14-4, C1, PR: 5) – It was a forgettable weekend for the Falcons in the Pleasant Hope Tournament. Dora went 0-3 there, with losses to Pleasant Hope (15-0), Lamar (11-10) and an extra-innings loss (9-7) to El Dorado Springs. Pleasant Hope and El Dorado Springs are two of the best teams Dora has faced this season (and Class 2 schools), so maybe seeing that competition can prep the Falcons for their district tournament next week. Dora rebounded though by beating Hartville 11-1 on Monday behind 9 strikeouts from freshman Keeli Land . Dora, whose other loss came 5-3 at Willow Springs on Sept. 15, finishes up the regular season by playing at MV-BT/Liberty on Thursday, then competing in the TRC Invitational this weekend in Poplar Bluff. If it gets the 2-seed for the Class 1, District 2 Tournament, Dora would have to beat likely 3-seed Thayer for the third time this season in order to reach the title game. 7. Ozark (17-3, C4, PR: 8) – Ozark may not be able to beat Republic (yet) this season, but they’ve shown they can do well against anyone else. Ozark lost 6-4 at Bolivar on Monday, but the Tigers had already beaten the Liberators 5-4 in the Ozark Fall Festival, meaning Republic’s the only other team to beat the Red and White this season. Ozark won the LN/LHS September Smash on Sept. 18 in Lee’s Summit, beating Fort Osage, Pleasant Hill and Webster Groves – all teams around the .500 mark. Ozark has also recently beaten Neosho (10-0), Willard (2-1), Carl Junction (9-1), Carthage (4-0) and Hillcrest (14-0, Senior Night). The Tigers head to the Carthage Invitational this weekend to close the regular season. Ozark will be the 1-seed for next week’s Class 4, District 11 tournament hosted by Kickapoo. 8. Morrisville (15-5, C2, PR: 6) – A disappointing outcome by the Lady Panthers’ standards last night, as Pleasant Hope scored 11 unanswered runs to hand Morrisville its most lopsided loss of the season . When you look at Morrisville’s season results, that Pleasant Hope game is definitely an outlier. Not only was it Morrisville’s most lopsided loss of the season, it was also the first time the Panthers have allowed double-digit runs in a game. Morrisville, behind senior Cassidy Elliott and freshman Katie Collins, has had pretty steady pitching this season. The problems, as occurred last night, have come defensively. Morrisville closes the regular season with winnable games against Class 1/Polk County League schools Halfway (Oct. 1), Fair Play (Oct. 2) and Weaubleau (Oct. 5). To earn a rematch with Pleasant Hope in next week’s Class 2, District 6 tournament, the Panthers will likely have to win the rubber match in their season series versus El Dorado Springs. Morrisville lost 3-2 at El Dorado Springs on Sept. 21, but beat the Bulldogs 6-5 in the finals of the Walnut Grove Tournament on Sept. 12. 9. Joplin (17-4, C4, PR: 10) – A good past two weeks for the Eagles, who have gone 9-1 since Sept. 16. Included in that was a 6-0 win over West Plains and a 4-3, extra-innings win over Lebanon, which sets up the Eagles on the inside track for the Ozark Conference title with remaining league games against Camdenton (Sept. 30), Kickapoo (Oct. 1) and Waynesville (Oct. 5). Joplin’s lone loss came 12-5 to Lee’s Summit North in the Springfield Invitational; LSN would go on to beat Republic in the finals to win that tournament last weekend. Michaela Sennett has been a great addition for Joplin , and with Mikaela Cox still in the fold , the Eagles have arguably the best 1-2 pitching duo in the area heading into districts. Joplin competes in the Carthage Invitational this weekend. Joplin’s the likely 2-seed for a Class 4, District 12 tournamen t that’s maybe a little stronger at the top, but not quite as deep as it was last year. 10. West Plains (16-9, C3, PR: 7) – The Zizzers had to be ready to get the heck out of Springfield by Saturday night, after going 1-4 at the Springfield Invitational. The Zizzers beat Carl Junction 8-4, but lost to Battle (7-2), Nixa (11-5), Willard (3-1) and Marshfield (9-7). Marshfield’s a district opponent, but with the Jays and Reeds Spring currently under .500, the Zizzers are still likely a top-2 district seed in Class 3, District 11 – along with Rogersville – despite their recent struggles. West Plains, which has also lost twice to Kickapoo recently, won 4-2 at Hillcrest on Monday and closes the regular season Oct. 5 at home versus Ava. 11. Willow Springs (14-4, C2, PR: 11) – Willow Springs will hope it never has to see Gainesville again this season, because the Bulldogs have handed the Bears a pair of ugly losses (11-0, 13-3) this season. Both of those outcomes were after the Bears beat Gainesville 5-3 on Sept. 1. Willow Spring’s other two losses have come against good Class 3 schools: 5-2 to West Plains and 8-2 to Salem (12-7 overall). Willow Springs has also beaten three superb Class 1 teams over the last two weeks: Dora (5-3), Van Buren (7-6) and Norwood (2-1). Willow Springs hosts Ava on Sept. 30 and plays at Houston on Oct. 1. The Bears close the regular season at the Three Rivers Tournament in Poplar Bluff this weekend. Willow Springs will likely be the 1-seed for its district tournament and could be the only team in the field with a winning record by then. 12. Rogersville (18-6, C3, PR: 13) – The Wildcats are another team on this list that’s playing well at the right time. Since losing 8-6 at Bolivar on Sept. 15, Rogersville has gone 9-2, with the two losses coming to Iberia (17-3 overall) and Class 4 Liberty (16-9 overall). The Wildcats went 4-1 at the Springfield Invitational over the weekend. Rogersville started this week by registering a 7-3 win over rival Marshfield, a game in which the Wildcats led 6-0 by the top of the sixth. Audra Metz had a homer in the win while Hayley Bledsoe struck out five in the first three innings. Rogersville, which lost 6-5 to West Plains on Aug. 31, will either be the 1 or 2 seed for its district tournament . The Wildcats close the regular season with home games against Walnut Grove (Oct. 2) and Republic (Oct. 5). 13. Camdenton (18-3, C4, PR: Unranked) – The Lakers have been on a roll over the last two weeks. Since Sept. 16, Camdenton has won 10 of 11 games. The lone loss came to Republic, 4-3, in the Springfield Invitational, a game in which the Lakers had the tying run on second base in the seventh inning. With wins over Willard and defending district champion Jefferson City this season, Camdenton will be the No. 1 seed for next week’s Class 4, District 10 tournament in Waynesville . Camdenton has beaten some really good Class 3 and Class 2 teams this season, but they don’t really have a win over a marquee Class 4 team (yet) or else they’d be higher on this list. The Lakers beat Parkview 16-1 on Monday for Senior Night and traveled to Joplin tonight for a game with major Ozark Conference title implications. Camdenton hosts Bolivar on Thursday and plays at Dixon Monday, Oct. 5. Camdenton winning its district would give us a 3-in-4 chance of having a local Class 4 team at state . The winner of Camdenton’s district (District 10) would likely meet Blue Springs or Blue Springs South in the sectional round, with the winner of that probably facing Ozark, Joplin or Republic in the quarterfinals. 14. El Dorado Springs (13-7, C2, PR: Unranked) – The Bulldogs get a spot on here in large part for playing a good Morrisville team to two close outcomes: a 3-2 win on Sept. 21 and a 6-5 loss on Sept. 12. They’ll likely get a rubber match in next week’s Class 2, District 6 tournament in Pleasant Hope. EDS got another quality win last weekend in the Pleasant Hope Invitational, beating Dora 9-7. One cool note: In a Sept. 23 win over Wheatland, pitcher Tailor Hutsell recorded 21 strikeouts . The Bulldogs finish the regular season by hosting Aurora on Monday, Oct. 5. 15. Dixon (14-5, C2, PR: Unranked) – The Bulldogs have gone 6-2 over the last two weeks, with the losses coming to Crocker (a team Dixon beat earlier in the season) and Class 1 Pilot Grove. Dixon’s other losses this season have come to Iberia (twice) and Class 3 St. Francis Borgia (17-4 overall). So other than that Pilot Grove loss, Dixon doesn’t have any “bad” losses on the resume. Dixon closes the regular season with games against Waynesville (Sept. 30), Vienna (Oct. 1) and Camdenton (Oct. 2). The Bulldogs will be either the 2 or 3 seed for the Class 2, District 5 Tournament hosted by Vienna, where they’ll likely meet Vienna in the semifinals, and with a win, Iberia in the finals.
