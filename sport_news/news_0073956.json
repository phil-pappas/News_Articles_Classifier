There wasn't an issue, anyway. \n\"There was a disagreement possibly on the penalty decision, although I think Garry was more aggrieved with the referee than he was with me. It was what it was.\" \nThe two clubs have met again since that fixture, with Swansea defeating Stoke 2-0 in Wales in May. \nAnd on that encounter with Monk, Hughes added: \"There was not a problem - we met after the game, had a drink and came home. I don't recall there was any ill-feeling after that game.\" \nSwansea ended last season eighth in the Barclays Premier League in what was their former defender and captain Monk's first full term in charge, and he has overseen a solid enough start to the current campaign, with his side lying 11th. \nHughes, whose side are 14th, has great admiration for the job his former Southampton team-mate has done in his maiden managerial role. \n\"He has done fantastically,\" Hughes said. \n\"He is at a good club with stability, not unlike myself here, and I think that is really important, certainly when you are the manager - it is reassuring that you have that stability in terms of the leadership and ownership of the club. \n\"I think that enables you to just get on with your job and do what you are employed to do. \n\"But he has taken to the role really very quickly. \n\"I think his standing at the club has probably helped - he has been there a long time and been the captain. He was obviously well thought of before he was given the opportunity. \n\"But there is a big difference between being a senior player and then having to tell fellow senior players what to do when you take on the role of a manager. \n\"He seems to have made that transition very comfortably, so that's credit to him.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:11:34.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
