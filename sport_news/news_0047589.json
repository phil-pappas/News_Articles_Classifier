The play stood upon replay review.\nReplay review helps Tech\nTCU appeared to have gotten a major break late in the third quarter when Mahomes apparently fumbled trying to throw and the Horned Frogs recovered at the Tech 26.\nBut the replay review ruled that Mahomes' arm was moving forward, making it an incomplete pass. On the next play, Mahomes found Devin Lauderdale for 37 yards down the sideline, eventually setting up a 37-yard field goal by Clayton Hatfield.\nBriefly\n-- Former Texas Tech standout Zach Thomas was honored at the game. Thomas will be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame this summer.\n-- The safety that TCU recorded on a bad Tech snap was its first since the 2010 season opener against Oregon State. Kingsbury said Tech was confused by TCU's line calls and snapped the ball early.\n-- TCU extended its consecutive games streak to 284, fourth longest in NCAA history.\n-- TCU's injuries have opened up even more chances for playing time. Cornerback Corry O'Meally and defensive end Bryson Henderson made their first career starts.\nFollow Chuck Carlton on Twitter at @ChuckCarltonDMN .\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN", "https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-27T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:53:40.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
