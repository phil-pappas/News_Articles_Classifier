Riggins, a former pitching coach with the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals, will move up after four years as their minor league pitching coordinator. Trades and injury left the Reds with an all-rookie starting rotation for the last 64 games of their last-place 2015 season.\nThe Reds also announced Jim Riggleman will move from third base coach to bench coach, with Billy Hatcher moving over to third from first base coach. Ousted were bench coach Jay Bell and pitching coach Jay Pico.\nEarlier, the team said Price will return for a third season.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
