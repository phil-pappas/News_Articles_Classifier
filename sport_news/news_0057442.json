But he took part in every aspect of Cleveland's workout Sunday, increasing his chances of playing in the season opener Tuesday in Chicago. \nCavs coach David Blatt describes James' practice as \"a good step\" and says it \"bodes well\" for the four-time MVP to face the Bulls to begin his 13th NBA season. \nThe 30-year-old James received a similar shot in his back early last season, when he was slowed by back pain and a strained left knee. James played in only two of Cleveland's seven exhibition games during the preseason. \nThe Cavs would like to cut his minutes during the regular season to keep James fresh for the playoffs. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:59:07.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
