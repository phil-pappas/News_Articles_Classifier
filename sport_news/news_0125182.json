Now, Parks Bureau spokesman Mark Ross said, it's on.\nOrganizer Paul Stanford said Wednesday morning that coordinators of the free-admission event are cramming seven months of work into about a month.\n\"We didn't have our date until 30 days ago,\" he said, because the Parks Bureau had denied its permit application. The City Council reversed the denial in August.\nStanford expects higher attendance this year because, he said, the festival won't have \"over-the-top security measures\" such as fences and bag searches.\nParks and police officials have been at odds with Hempstalk for nearly two years, saying organizers did a poor job controlling drug use at previous festivals. Parks officials twice denied a permit only to have the City Council ask the bureau to try to make it work.\n-- Andrew Theen\natheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:28:30.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
