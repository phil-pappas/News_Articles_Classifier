A national TV audience will watch on ESPN, and a large crowd is expected in 63,470-seat LaVell Edwards Stadium. \nIt will be the first football game for the Bearcats in the state of Utah, according to the UC sports communications department. It also will be the first UC game in the Mountain time zone (two hours behind Cincinnati) since the 1997 Humanitarian Bowl, when the Bearcats beat Utah State 35-19 in Boise, Idaho. \nUC has not played this far West since opening the 2010 season at Fresno State (Calif.), a 28-14 loss in the first Bearcats game for then-coach Butch Jones. \nUC also will be playing at high altitude in Provo (elevation 4,549 feet), but the Bearcats say the relatively thin air is no concern. \n“They said something about the altitude is different out there and it should be harder to breathe,” said UC sophomore running back Mike Boone, a native of Maccleny, Florida. “I mean, the Denver Broncos do it. I feel like we can go out and do the same thing. I don’t feel like it will be a problem.” \nUC coach Tommy Tuberville has not faced BYU as a head coach, but he was an assistant at the University of Miami in 1990 when BYU upset the No. 1 Hurricanes 28-21 in Provo. \n“We’re not playing in Denver or one of those places where it’s a mile high,” Tuberville said. “The weather is going to be about the same as it is here. There shouldn’t be any problem. It’s just going on the road and playing in front of 70,000 people, and we haven’t done that in a while.” \nQB WATCH : Redshirt freshman quarterback Hayden Moore led the Bearcats to a 34-23 upset of the Miami Hurricanes when UC last played Oct. 1, with usual starter Gunner Kiel (neck) sidelined. Kiel back, but UC QB job still open \nUC was idle last week and Kiel returned to practice this past Sunday, but Tuberville said he will not announce this week’s starter beforehand. In fact, Tuberville said the quarterback competition has evolved to where he may go week-to-week in deciding who starts. \n“They’re so close, Gunner having more experience but also turning the ball over more this year,” Tuberville said. “Hayden being a young guy, he got off to a slow start against Miami of Ohio but really has played well his last two games. I’m looking for a quarterback that doesn’t turn the ball over, that makes good decisions. \n“It’s going to be a very competitive situation with these two, until one of them separates from the other. You never really want a quarterback controversy, but this has kind of come out of the shadows. It’s not something we planned.” \nTuberville has shielded both quarterbacks from media interviews this week. The coach was asked how Kiel is handling the situation. \n“Not very well, and he shouldn’t,” Tuberville said. “He’s very competitive. He wants to be the starter this week.” \nTHE SERIES : UC and FBS independent BYU agreed to a home-and-home series a few years ago, and this will be their first football meeting. BYU will return the favor by visiting UC’s Nippert Stadium on Nov. 12, 2016. \n-", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:43:48.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
