Schamerhorn started this season 1-3 with a 3.73 goals-against average and a .902 save percentage for the Vernon Vipers and was traded to the Centennials before being flipped to Dauphin. \nIn another MJHL move, the Portage Terriers have picked up 20-year-old forward Braydon MacDonald and future considerations from the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League’s Melfort Mustangs for forward Tyler Jeanson, 18. \nMacDonald had one goal in five games with the Mustangs. Jeanson had 54 points in 56 games last season and helped Portage win the Canadian junior A championship. \nhe Brandon Sun Rate this This article has not yet been rated.
