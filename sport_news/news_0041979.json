You remember in a flood, three inches a day, that's how slowly it's going down, so there's still a lot of need,” Kay Wilkins, the Regional CEO for American Red Cross in Louisiana, said.\nDuring the weekend, Red Cross volunteers set up outside Tiger Stadium as LSU welcomed the South Carolina Gamecocks for a home game in Death Valley. Those volunteers collected more than $40,000 during the few hours before the game.\n“They would stuff those dollars into the cans, I would say thank you from South Carolina, and they would say, we know what it feels like, we've been through it,” Wilkins said.\nIt’s why more than a dozen people traveled to South Carolina, like Carolyn Adams, who left early last week.\n“You can't even imagine, how they tell us, ‘my god, I don't know where we would go if y'all weren't here,’” Adams said.\nAdams is running a shelter for people who have nowhere to live, but back at home, the Red Cross opened another shelter, for people displaced by an apartment fire in Kenner.\n“The lady that I'm with, she got a call sometime late last night, because she does a lot with shelters and they called her in Baton Rouge, because of the shelter in Kenner, and we said, ‘oh no, we're in South Carolina, we can't come help,’ so had we'd been there we may have been in Kenner as well,” Adams said.\nIn fact, the volunteers at the shelter in Kenner had to come from Baton Rouge, because more volunteers are needed locally.\n“Really we had a lot that went to South Carolina, now, and we need people to volunteer and come help us right now, because we are shorthanded and we do need people,” Mary Bizette, a Red Cross volunteer, said.\nIf you’d like help, you can learn more about volunteering for the American Red Cross here or you can donate money to help their efforts.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
