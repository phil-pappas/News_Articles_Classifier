Welcome to Vivint Smart Home Arena!\n pic.twitter.com/EpAvvdAU99\n— Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) October 26, 2015 SALT LAKE CITY — The building on the corner of Stockton and Malone is about to be renamed.\nThe Utah Jazz will hold a press conference Monday to announce the new name of the Miller-owned arena — Vivint Smart Home Arena, multiple sources confirmed to the Deseret News.\nThe team's Twitter account confirmed the name change Monday morning. The name change goes into effect immediately as it did in 2006 when EnergySolutions Arena replaced the Delta Center.\nThe Jazz's 25-year-old home building has been known as EnergySolutions Arena for the past nine years and as the Delta Center the previous 15 years (or still, depending on the person).\nProvo-based Vivint has been rumored as a potential buyer of the arena's naming rights for months. The company signed a 10-year naming agreement with Larry H. Miller Sports & Entertainment.\nInterestingly, the website domains for VivintSmartHomeArena.com, VivintSmartHomeCenter.com, VivintArena.com and VivintCenter.com were all purchased on Sept. 11 of this year, according to the Whois.com record. The sites were purchased through a company called Perfect Privacy that protects the identity of businesses and people who buy domain registrations.\nThe website VivintSmartHomeArena.com was not yet live as of early Monday morning.\n\"The Utah Jazz and the arena are proud to have Vivint as our new naming rights partner,\" LHMSE President Steve Starks said in a statement released through a press release Monday morning. \"Vivint is a long-time supporter of the Jazz, is a Utah-based company, and has a deep commitment to the community and our fans. These were all qualities we looked for when we began this process.\"\nVivint is a smart home and security products and services provider.\n\"The Utah Jazz and the arena have been an incredible economic engine for this region, and have created a tremendous sense of pride among Utahns,\" Todd Pedersen, CEO of Vivint, said in a prepared statement. \"This agreement extends far beyond a typical ‘logo-on-the-building’ arrangement – it’s a true partnership built around innovation, community impact and the drive to elevate the prominence of Utah.\"\nJazz owner Gail Miller said she's \"pleased about this association between two Utah business.\"\n“Vivint shares our vision of having the arena be a gathering place for our community where millions of visitors can enjoy the Jazz and other first-class entertainment,\" she said in a statement. \"I also want to thank EnergySolutions for their past contributions and continued support of our company and the Jazz.\nThis is the latest change for an arena that has undergone a $25 renovation, including a massive, $15 million video scoreboard.\nEnergySolutions remains as a Champion Partner.\n\"Our partnership with the Utah Jazz over the past decade has been a tremendous opportunity for our company,\" said David Lockwood, CEO of EnergySolutions in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing as a Champion Partner for the Jazz and also our new role as a lead sponsor for Junior Jazz across the State of Utah as well as our commitment to work with the Miller Family on several community projects.\"\nProvo entrepreneur Tyler Richards was the first to suggest that the full name of the arena would be Vivint Smart Home Arena after the Deseret News reported about Monday's press conference.\nEMAIL: jody@desnews.com\nTWITTER: DJJazzyJody", "external_links": ["https://t.co/EpAvvdAU99", "https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/658645085639352320", "https://twitter.com/vivintarena"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:17:27.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
