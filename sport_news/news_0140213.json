That triumph sparked the Red Sox to the first of eight consecutive postseason victories and their first World Series title in 86 seasons.\n\"Every little thing matters,\" Hoyer said Thursday as the Cubs assess multiple factors before their NL play-in game against the Pirates on Wednesday night.\n\"That's the nature of the rosters. You have to assume that anyone on the roster (could) be in a huge spot because it (seems) like the game finds that person.\"\nAlong those lines, the Cubs added Quintin Berry on Sept. 1 as a pinch-running option. And manager Joe Maddon hasn't ruled out rookie reliever Carl Edwards Jr. despite his having only four games of major-league experience.\nWith a low-scoring game expected at spacious PNC Park, outfield defense could be at a premium. But the Cubs would like to strike early against formidable Pirates ace Gerrit Cole.\nThat's why the Cubs are assessing all their options and scenarios with the help of their analytics department, which will provide manager Joe Maddon with various combinations before the roster is finalized.\nIn the fourth and ultimately deciding game of the 2013 AL division series, Maddon started Jeremy Hellickson for his Rays but pulled him after the first three Red Sox batters reached base in the second inning. Maddon ended up using eight relievers but the Rays were eliminated 3-1.\n\"All hands on deck,\" Maddon said. \"Let's go. If you have to win a game, you have to win a game. You do those things. I'm not worried about it. I'm not concerned about our bullpen right now. With what (Trevor) Cahill, (Clayton) Richard and (Travis) Wood have done, you feel good about it if you had to do something.\nBut Maddon won't have the luxury of using that many relievers without sacrificing several pinch-hitters, which was a concern of his in the AL. The Cubs are expected to leave at least three of their starting pitchers off their wild-card roster.\nThe Cubs (94-65) are expected to add at least one back if they advance to the NLDS. Jason Hammel pitched five scoreless innings Thursday in a 5-3 victory over the Reds that extended their winning streak to five games.\nA 5-0 lead after five innings also enabled Maddon to use six relievers — Justin Grimm, Fernando Rodney, Richard, Cahill, Pedro Strop and Hector Rondon — all of whom are expected to be on the Cubs' wild-card roster (along with Wood and probably Jon Lester to back up starter Jake Arrieta).\n\"I had that set up before the game,\" Maddon said of his plan to pull Hammel after five innings.\nMaddon wanted to use only Grimm, Rodney, Strop and Rondon but said Richard and Cahill would be available to pitch Friday night against the Brewers.\n\"I thought (Hammel) did very well,\" Maddon said. \"No reason to see him beyond that, but you have to keep pertinent bullpen guys in the loop, too.\"\nWhen asked if he expected to start in an NLDS game if the Cubs advance that far, Hammel replied, \"I'm going to prepare that way.\"\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon Boston Red Sox Pittsburgh Pirates American League Championship Series Fernando Rodney", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dd224/turbine/ct-wild-card-roster-report-cubs-spt-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:02:54.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
