ANDY BRONSON THE BELLINGHAM HERALD i Order Reprint of this Story \nMarcus Potts is a senior quarterback/tight end/linebacker at Blaine High School. He began playing football through the Boys and Girls Club and his earliest memories include being out on the field. \nPotts plays both football and basketball, having a successful high school career in each, but his career goals are focused around his passion for cooking. In his free time Potts loves to cook for his family and experiment with new recipes. \nQuestion: What are some things you like to do other than football? \nAnswer: I also play basketball but outside of school. I love to go hiking with my friends and go bike riding. I love to go on hiking trips. Orcas Island, that is always a No. 1 favorite. . . Every year, me and my buddies take the car down to Orcas Island, just for the weekend. It is just us out there — no parents —and we go hiking and have a great time. \nQ: What are your plans for after high school? \nA: I have really thought about what I want to do. I’ve been talking to my parents, and I want to stick around here, maybe go to community college or a four-year school close to home. I’ve been looking at Whatcom (Community College) and Central (Washington University). \nQ: What is your favorite class? \nA: Culinary. I just love cooking, I’m really passionate about it, cooking for my family. \nQ: Is that what you want to pursue with your career? Why? \nA: When people look at cooking, I think making a PB&J sandwich or just flipping a burger, but I like breaking it down to what spices or flavors need to go into the recipe. I like to take a recipe off the internet and really make it my own. That is something I would look into doing with school, whether taking an apprenticeship or getting a degree in culinary arts. \nQ: What are your favorite memories from your high school football career so far? \nA: I would just say, getting to play at the varsity level as a sophomore. I think that is the reason I have been able to play at the level I have, being given the opportunities to really learn and develop those skills. Also, our toughness this year as a team. We are not the biggest team, but we fight every game. \nQ: Do you have any pre-game rituals? \nA: My pre-game song is always AC/DC’s “Hells Bells” or something like that. \nQuick hits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:26:05.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
