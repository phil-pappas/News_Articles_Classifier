Jailers brushed her pleas off as lies. Other inmates ostracized her for not owning up to who she was.\nAs it turns out, Eggleton was telling the truth.\nOn the eighth day, after Eggleton was transported to Jefferson County Jail in Madras, a deputy realized the mistake and released her.\nThat's all according to a lawsuit Eggleton filed Monday in Multnomah County Circuit Court. Eggleton seeks $300,000 for her nightmarish experiences in county lock-ups in February 2014, based on a warrant issued for a different woman with a similar name.\nThe history of how the mistake came to be is long and convoluted, but ultimately the mistake could been obvious: Eggleton was 2 to 3 inches shorter than the wanted woman and 70 pounds lighter, says Eggleton's civil attorney, Josh Lamborn.\nThe two were born within three years of each other and each had brown hair and blue or green eyes, according to Eggleton's attorney. They also had had similar names: Eggleton was once known by her former married surname, making her full name Tiffany Nicole Wilson. And the wanted woman's name was Tiffany Lyn Wilson, according to the lawsuit.\nEggleton's troubles relevant to the lawsuit began in 2005, when she was in her early 20s and arrested on accusations of driving under the influence of intoxicants under her name at the time, Tiffany Nicole Wilson. The case was later dismissed after she completed a diversion program, but her personal information was now in the state's criminal database.\nOn Feb. 13, 2014, Eggleton was in the midst of a heated divorce, according to the suit. She called 911 to report that her husband had violated a restraining order she and their young daughter had against him for picking the daughter up from daycare, her attorney said.\nA 911 dispatcher who answered Eggleton's call noticed that Eggleton appeared to have a warrant out for her arrest, her attorney said. Unbeknownst to the dispatcher, a Jefferson County sheriff's employee mistakenly linked Eggleton to the warrant, which had been issued in Jefferson County in 2012 for Tiffany Lyn Wilson for a theft charge, according to the suit.\nPortland police met with Eggleton and asked if she was once known as Tiffany Nicole Wilson, according to the suit. And when she said yes, they arrested her, according to her suit. Eggleton offered to show them her Social Security card and her birth certificate to prove they had the wrong person, but police weren't interested, her attorney said. Police also didn't want to see her driver's license.\n\"They said this could be faked,\" said Lamborn, Eggleton's attorney. Lamborn said police told his client that the jail would sort out any problem.\n\"The jail doesn't do anything, they just leave her in jail and let her rot,\" Lamborn said.\nEggleton had to wait a week to take a jail transport shuttle to the Jefferson County Jail, where the next morning -- on Feb. 21, 2014 -- a deputy let her go, the suit states.\nEggleton had never spent a night in jail before this experience, her attorney said. And part of her distress from the experience was knowing that her estranged husband was looking after their daughter -- despite the restraining order she had obtained and her report that she worried he had harmed the girl, Eggleton's attorney said.\nThe suit seeks damages from Jefferson County, the City of Portland and Multnomah County. Jefferson County didn't immediately return a call seeking comment Tuesday. Portland and Multnomah County declined comment.\nAlthough exceedingly rare, cases of mistaken identity have landed innocent people in jail before.\nA Clackamas County jury awarded a Happy Valley woman -- who had been a victim of identity theft -- $101,500 after she spent a night in jail in 2009 when deputies mistook her for the woman who stole her identity.\nA man who spent 10 days in Clark County Jail in 2010 received a $33,500 settlement after deputies and jailers thought he was his brother, who had falsely used his name.\nRead the lawsuit .\n-- Aimee Green\nagreen@oregonian.com\n503-294-5119\n@o_aimee", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:16:25.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
