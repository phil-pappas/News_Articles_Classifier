In our projections, the Cardinal run the table and topple the Utes in the conference title game. But even with a Pac-12 championship in hand, Stanford might not have the résumé to reach the College Football Playoff. We project Baylor , Michigan State and Clemson to all finish as unbeaten conference champs. Meanwhile, SEC champ Alabama is projected to end the year with one loss, but that setback (a 43-37 loss to Ole Miss ) will look better in the eyes of the committee committee than Stanford’s 16-6 loss to Northwestern .\nCollege Football Video Halfway Heisman Watch: LSU RB Leonard Fournette leading field by Zac Ellis", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ZacEllis"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:33:20.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
