That falls on Big Money Krebs. He has never met an expense he will not approve. He really thinks money grows on trees.\n— Burt\nIT WAS VERY discouraging to see the Lobos dominated by a middle-of-the-pack MWC opponent like Nevada on Saturday. We were lead to believe by UNM’s two game winning streak, Coach Davie’s words and his dance moves that UNM was turning the corner. I guess not. Perhaps this so-called progress was just fool’s gold considering the Lobos’ three wins have come against teams that are a combined 0-18.\n— Robert, Albuquerque\nFIRST TULSA. Now Nevada. Another missed corner on the road to respectability for Lobo football.\n— John\nI’VE SEEN EVERY college football team in the state play, and regardless of division ENMU is hand’s down the best. ENMU also has the most NM kids on scholarship. Coincidence? How did the Lobos/Aggies pass on Kamal Cass? Unbelievable. Oh yeah he’s from New Mexico that’s why.\n— B Yaz NM native\nHEY “MIKE” while you are boycotting UNM, because they “don’t have enough players from New Mexico”, I would like you to consider this: UNM has 25 players from New Mexico, NMSU has 15. You need to stand up like a man and state why you hate New Mexico football. Did your son not get a scholarship to play for the Lobos? Or perhaps you were snubbed? The fact that your tripe gets printed in the local paper is a reflection on the true lack of intelligent life on this planet.\n— Rudy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:23:26.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
