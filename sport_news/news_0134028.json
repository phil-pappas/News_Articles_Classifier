But because of the nature of the slide and Tejada's defenseless position, the Mets shortstop left the game with a fractured right fibula.\nAnd after Tejada was carted off the field, the Dodgers challenged the ruling on the play and had the out overturned because Tejada's foot missed the bag. Utley was ruled safe, even though he himself had not touched the bag.\nThe Dodgers went on to win the game 5-3 and even the NLDS at 1-1, but discussion of the slide raged on in the social media universe long after the final out was recorded.\nHere's a sampling of some of the reaction from the MLB community on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:09:19.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
