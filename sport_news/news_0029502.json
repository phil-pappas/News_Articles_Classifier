International stores are not affected.\nThe plan will wipe out more than $200 million in bonds held by the retailer in exchange for equity interests. Lenders will provide about $90 million in debtor-in-possession financing.\nAmerican Apparel's board has approved the restructuring plan, which is expected to be completed in about six months. It still needs approvals from the bankruptcy court.\nShares of American Apparel Inc. plunged more than 24 percent in Monday premarket trading.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
