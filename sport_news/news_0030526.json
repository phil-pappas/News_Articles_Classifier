With Piatek leading the way, the Wolves went on to score on their next four offensive possessions. \n“We knew we were going to rotate quarterbacks,” LeBlanc said. “Jackson has done a great job at preparing, and obviously he came out and played a heck of a game.” \nPiatek’s first drive ended with a 12-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Kijana Caldwell. \nAfter a Central punt, Devin Riley (six carries, 85 yards) lined up at quarterback in the “wildcat” formation and scored from 8 yards out. On the Wolves’ next two possessions, Piatek scored on a 1-yard run, and he also connected with Tyler Allison (four receptions, 131 yards) to make it 28-0 at the half. \nEast’s defense also dominated in the first half as it allowed only 50 total yards of offense to the Wildcats. \n“That’s what we expect from are defense every week,” LeBlanc said. “We’ve hung our hat on our defense this year, and they’ve stepped up most of the time.” \nAfter an 11-yard touchdown run by Riley put the Wolves (4-3, 2-3) in front 35-0, the Wildcats (0-7, 0-5) were able to find their way into the end zone in the third quarter. \nQuarterback Cameron Cercone (9 of 22 passing, 110 yards) hit wide receiver Justin Montalto (two receptions, 52 yards) for a 45-yard touchdown. On Central’s next drive, Cercone targeted Adam Hayes for a 9-yard touchdown to make it 35-14. \nThe Wolves, however, continued to score as Piatek threw a 9-yard touchdown to Riley, and later Riley had a 65-yard run for his fourth touchdown. \n“I give East credit. They didn’t make mistakes or hurt themselves,” Central coach John Jackson said after the Wolves handed the Wildcats their 27th consecutive loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:03:02.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
