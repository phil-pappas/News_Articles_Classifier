(Photo: Matt Marton/AP) 75 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMUNCIE — It took Riley Neal a few seconds at a recent practice to remember the last time he slid in a game. \nIt wasn’t in high school, when the quarterback ran for more than 1,300 yards and scored 27 touchdowns as a senior at Yorktown. His coach, Mike Wilhelm, confirmed that: \"Oh no, he never slid. I'm not sure if he even knows how. I don’t think I ever taught him.\" \nThen Neal remembered. Eighth grade was the last time — and only time, at least that he can recall — that he slid. \nIt didn’t go over well. \n“My dad about ripped my head off,” Neal said, “and I haven’t really slid since.” \nThat's just the \"Neal Way,\" according to Wilhelm. Neal's father, Jesse, and uncle, Jay, each played at Ball State. \n\"If you slide, you’re going to be made fun of at Thanksgiving,\" Wilhelm said. \"That’s a tough family.\" \nNow Ball State’s starting quarterback as a true freshman, the 6-foot-5, 215-pound Neal has carried over that same mentality. Instead of avoiding contact, like most quarterbacks, he embraces it. Instead of sliding, he falls forward for extra yards. It's certainly not the attitude most quarterbacks take into games. \nWhile it has certainly worked for Neal, should the coaches be concerned that he's being exposed to big hits? After all, this isn’t high school anymore, when Neal was typically one of the biggest players on the field. Now, he is playing against guys three and four years older and 100 pounds heavier. He was noticeably limping during Saturday’s 24-19 loss at No. 17 Northwestern after he took a helmet to the hip. \nNeal carried the ball 16 times in that game, his first career start. He had 11 rushes against Eastern Michigan and eight against Texas A&M , but he was coming off the bench in those games. There's a legitimate possibility that 16 rushing attempts could be a normal workload for Neal, especially when a defense takes away the tailback on the zone read like Northwestern did. \nBall State quarterback Riley Neal is tackled by Northwestern linebacker Anthony Walker during the second half at Ryan Field. (Photo: Caylor Arnold/USA TODAY Sports) \nConsidering his value to the Cardinals, who are 2-2 heading into Saturday’s showdown with Mid-American Conference favorite Toledo (3-0), might he consider a change in mentality? \n“It’s honestly never even crossed my mind,” Neal said of sliding. “If I needed to (slide), I could obviously. I’m not incapable of sliding. As long as they’re OK with me not sliding, that’s probably what I’ll stay with.” \nThe coaching staff seems to be on board with Neal’s bruising running style. He said he hasn’t been told to slide, but offensive coordinator Joey Lynch would like him to be a little more selective with the hits he’s taking — without compromising the attributes that make him so dynamic. \n“One run late against Northwestern,” Lynch recalled, “he got what he could and ran out of bounds, which was good to see. Early in the game, he tried to jump over a guy. \n“But that’s his personality — he’s a football player. That’s why we’re really, really excited about him. He’s a quarterback, but he’s a football player, too.” \nAnd a good one at that, which is probably part of the reason the Cardinals don’t want to limit him. Neal has 217 yards on 35 carries (6.2 average) in addition to completing 49 of 82 passes for 488 yards. \nBall State coach Pete Lembo smiled when asked if there is a target number of carries for Neal each game. \n“The ideal number is zero,\" he said. \"You’d like your quarterback to never have to carry it. (But) for us to be as diverse as we’d like to be offensively and to play to our strengths, we have to incorporate him into the run game. You have to put any fear or any caution aside and play to the strengths of the guys you have. There’s no real magic number.” \nLembo isn't against having a running quarterback; it just isn't something he's used to. At Elon he coached Scott Riddle, who was seventh in the nation in passing yards per game as a senior, and then he coached Keith Wenning at Ball State, who owns the program record for career touchdown passes. \nBall State quarterback Riley Neal runs against Northwestern defensive lineman Dean Lowry during the first quarter last Saturday in Evanston, Ill. (Photo: Matt Marton/AP) \nMoving forward, Lynch is stressing awareness of the situation. Third-and-short, be a football player. But if you already have the first down, get out of harm's way. \n“It’s more just a young kid understanding when the right time to be a physical football player is and when is the right to get out of bounds or get down,\" Lynch said. \"That’s where we’re at right now, just educating him that there’s a time and place for everything.” \nNeal insisted he's able to shake off hits quickly, like he did Saturday. How long he feels that way remains to be seen. \n“I’m still a really young guy,” Neal said. “I’m not a fifth-year senior or anything. I still feel pretty good. Obviously things change and what not, but as of now I feel fine.” \nContact sports features writer Ryan O’Gara at (765) 213-5829.
