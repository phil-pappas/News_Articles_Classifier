We aren’t running a lot of plays for him, but the ball is finding him,” Casey said.\nOnly Vince Carter (38 points) had ever topped 35 in a pre-season contest, but Lowry caught fire in the third quarter, adding 18 points, to his first-half total of 22. Lowry 6-of-7 three-point attempts, before missing a couple of heat checks later on.\nNot that he was impressed.\n“Not a damn thing,” was Lowry’s response after he was informed about the accomplishment.\n“It’s only pre-season ... for me, it’s about maintaining. Start off well, finish well.”\nThe point guard, so disappointed after playing some of the worst basketball of his life during Toronto’s playoff sweep at the hands of the Washington Wizards last May, is in great shape and it has carried over to the court.\nLowry’s absurd pre-season line so far: 91 points in 75 minutes on 28-41 shooting (including 11-for-17 from three), 11 assists and five turnovers. Lowry was an all-star last season, and if he posts numbers anywhere close during the regular season as he has in the exhibition contests, he’ll be one again, this time at home.\n“He could have probably turned backward and threw it at the rim and it probably would have went in tonight,” marvelled backup point guard Cory Joseph.\nVaughan’s Andrew Wiggins also turned in an outstanding performance in limited minutes, scoring 22 of his team’s 59 points in the first half, including a couple of three-pointers and dunks, before being given the rest of the night off by interim head coach Sam Mitchell.\nToronto’s young guns also impressed early, particularly Anthony Bennett — facing his former team for the first time, Bruno Caboclo and Norman Powell.\nBennett, who Casey praised pre-game for his surprisingly good defensive play at camp so far, was at it again, providing a presence at the rim, while also hauling in three rebounds in eight first-half minutes.\nMeanwhile, Caboclo, the youngest player in the 2014 draft, has come a long way. Though he still has a long way to go before he can become an NBA regular, he continues to show intriguing flashes of his potential.\nOn Monday, Caboclo, the 20th pick in 2014, rejected 2015 top dog Karl-Anthony Towns at the rim, then raced to the other end a couple of plays later to throw down a dunk. He later added a three-pointer.\nPowell, Toronto’s second-round selection this year, scored five quick points in the opening half.\nOn the negative side, starting power forward Patrick Patterson continues to struggle. He didn’t score until the start of the third quarter and has collected only eight points in four outings now. Patterson is turning down shots and hasn’t looked comfortable with the starting lineup, though DeMar DeRozan was given a night off for Terrence Ross in this one. (Ross went scoreless, before hobbling off after turning his ankle in the third).\nIf one were to nit-pick, ball-movement — another Casey emphasis heading into the season — was not very good. The team managed only five assists on 21 scores in the opening 24 minutes, though the second half at least brought slightly better movement.\nCasey also bemoaned Toronto’s inability to play defence without fouling.\nATTACK THE RACK\nWhile the passing wasn’t particularly crisp, one thing Toronto did well on Monday again was get to the hoop.\nLowry and fellow point guard Joseph (14 points) in particular.\n“I didn’t really know he can attack the goal like he attacked it, because in San Antonio he was behind Tony (Parker) and Patty (Mills),” DeMarre Caroll said earlier this week.\n“So it was kind of hard to see him play all the time, but he’s really impressed me.”\nJoseph had at least three impressive drives during the game.\nVETS TEACHING\nWiggins, Towns and Co. are getting quite a bit of help from 21-year veteran Kevin Garnett and fellow old-timers Andre Miller and Tayshaun Prince.\nGarnett constantly works at practice with the young star.\n“Just in those couple of minutes, he teaches me and tells me stuff that can help me for the rest of my career,” Wiggins said at shootaround Monday.\n“Kevin is one of the best examples a young guy could have as far as working, ‘cause I guarantee he practises as hard as he plays,” Casey said before the game, adding the youngsters probably wouldn’t appreciate the tutelage until a few years down the road.\nCAN-CON\nLowry didn’t set the only record on Monday. Four Canadians scored at least three points in the game, with Andrew Wiggins scoring 21, brother Nick four, (a runner at the buzzer to end the game was waved off because it was a split second late). Joseph had 14 and Bennett three.\n“Four Canadians on the floor tonight is unbelievable,” Joseph said.\n“It just goes to show how much talent we have here in Canada and how much we’re moving up the ranks and I’m looking forward to doing it again in Ottawa (in a rematch on Wednesday).”\nKyle Lowry scores 40 as Raptors beat T-Wolves\nBy Ryan Wolstat Monday, October 12, 2015 11:15 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 12, 2015 11:37 PM EDT\n With the Blue Jays putting on a show in Texas, Dwane Casey said he couldn’t fault Raptors fans for staying home on Monday night.\n“That’s great, I’m a baseball man, grew up playing, coaching it ... and if there’s nobody here tonight, they’ve got a good excuse,” the Raptors coach said before his team took on the Minnesota Timberwolves in a pre-season contest.\nBut there was a decent turnout nonetheless and though the game felt at times like a never-ending parade of whistles and delays, there were still some interesting things to see.\nMost notably, Kyle Lowry continued his torrid pre-season play, bettering his previous two outings, which were quite impressive themselves with a ridiculous 40-point performance in 28 minutes in Toronto’s 112-105 victory.\nOnly Vince Carter (38 points) had ever topped 35 in a pre-season contest, but Lowry caught fire in the third quarter, adding 18 points, to his first-half total of 22.
