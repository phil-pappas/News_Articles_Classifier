On his podcast Jalen & Jacoby , the former college basketball star revealed some hard truths in regards to the Louisville escort scandal . While rocking gold chains and Cazals, Rose let listeners and those who haven't seen Blue Chips or He Got Game know what really goes down during recruiting trips.\n\"I want to paint a picture. What you see at a bachelor or bachelorette party is what happens on a recruiting visit. Yes, there is drinking. Yes, there is members of the opposite sex that are present. Remember, they're trying to woo me to the campus. And as a 17-year-old kid, first off, if I'm not getting laid, I'm not coming. I'm not signing. I'm not coming.\"\nRose is somewhat of an expert on this topic since he was heavily recruited coming out high school. One of his stipulations for choosing a school? Getting laid. Duh. The 6-foot-8 point guard was recruited by Michigan , Syracuse , Michigan State , and UNLV , and it seems like the Wolverines showed him the best time of the bunch. Check out a clip of the podcast below.\nJalen Rose is the perfect example of why \"you can't handle the truth!\" Too many judging him for this honesty. pic.twitter.com/4qBcn4R0sw\nâ€” Mike Welch (@RealMikeWelch) October 22, 2015 ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RealMikeWelch/status/657175782683361281", "https://t.co/4qBcn4R0sw"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:22:24.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
