Halak made a second straight start after returning from an upper-body injury sustained during the preseason. \nThe Blue Jackets extended their franchise-worst start and became the third team in the NHL’s modern history to open a season 0-7. Curtis McElhinney finished with 25 saves and was steady throughout, making several key saves to keep Columbus within striking distance for most of the game. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:20:49.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
