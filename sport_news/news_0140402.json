It was bound to follow various directions emanating from the Government of India not to participate in the EU-ETS. Those directions from the Indian Government could not oust the application of the EU-ETS, as and when Jet flew to and from EU aerodromes and thus bound itself to the EU-ETS,\" Justice David Hart ruled in a judgement published on Thursday.\nThe British ruling notice, dated October 12, said that Jet Airways was required to submit carbon allowances to cover 150 tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2012.\nHart was appointed by the UK's energy and climate change ministry to look into Jet's appeal and has already rejected an appeal by the Mumbai-based airline earlier this year.\nThe UK's Environment Agency (EA) had issued a \"notice of determination\" to Jet in June 2014 relating to 150 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted by the airline that year, the first stage in the disciplinary process that can result in fines of 100 euro per tonne plus the cost of the un-surrendered allowances, the revoking of an airline's operating licence, or the impounding and sale of aircraft.\nThis led to Jet's appeal against the notice.\nThe EU had scaled back its airline carbon market in 2012 from covering all flights using European airports to only those flying between them, amid claims the scheme infringed on the sovereignty of other countries and protests from India and other countries including Saudi Arabia and Russia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:11:43.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
