But to score a goal that fast when you don’t even start with possession? The other team had the ball, and Grella still only needs seven seconds to score.\nGrella’s goal is being called the fastest in MLS history. Tim Cahill, also of the Red Bulls, scored a goal in seven seconds in 2013. Grella’s I’m guessing is a hair faster.\n(Thanks to NBC Sports for sharing.)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://soccer.nbcsports.com/2015/10/18/video-mike-grella-scores-fastest-goal-in-mls-history-7-seconds/", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/10/tim-cahill-fastest-goal-in-mls-history-seven-seconds", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:54:29.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
