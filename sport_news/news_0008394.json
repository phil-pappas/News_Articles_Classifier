Other outlets have said he had suffered several strokes, was breathing with the assistance of a ventilator and had only a 50-50 chance of recovery.\nBrothel staff told authorities Odom had used cocaine and as many as 10 tablets of a sexual performance-enhancing supplement during his four-day stay there, the Nye County Sheriff said.\nThe 6-foot, 10-inch-tall (2 metre) forward has long been rumored to have struggled with substance abuse, and he was suspended during the 2000-2001 season for violating the National Basketball Association's anti-drug policy.\n\"Entertainment Tonight\" said Odom had briefly fluttered open his eyes on Wednesday night and may have squeezed the hand of Khloe Kardashian's sister, Kim Kardashian, who was among those at the hospital.\nThe Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center in Las Vegas, where Odom, 35, was being treated, has declined to comment on his condition, citing patient confidentiality.\nOdom's estranged father, Joe Odom, the athlete's two children from a previous relationship, and his ex-girlfriend were also photographed entering the hospital.\nOdom split with Kardashian, 31, in 2013 after a whirlwind romance and marriage that was captured on the television show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" and its spinoff series \"Khloe & Lamar.\"\nAlthough the couple signed divorce papers in July, a Los Angeles Superior Court spokeswoman said the divorce has yet to be finalized and they remain legally married.\nPeople magazine, citing a source close to the family, said on Thursday that Khloe Kardashian was given the task of making medical decisions about Odom's treatment but was \"overwhelmed\" by the unexpected responsibility.\n\"She had been thinking of him as an ex, so to find out that, 'No, you have to do this,' well that's really hard for her,\" the magazine Quote: d the source as saying.\nDespite Odom's 14 seasons with the NBA, including two championships with the Los Angeles Lakers, U.S. media have largely focused this week on his brief membership in the most famous family on reality television.\nESPN sportscaster Scott Van Pelt took issue with the celebrity-skewed coverage, noting Odom's accomplishments as a multiple NBA champion and beloved teammate.\n\"I understand not everyone watches sports, but 'Kardashian reality star?' His name is Lamar Odom, and we knew it, long before he got married on a TV show we don't watch,\" Van Pelt said on his \"SportsCenter\" show on Wednesday.\nKardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, posted a photo of Odom in his Lakers uniform on her Instagram account, asking fans to \"please pray for Lamar #ourfighter.\"\nCurrently a free agent, Odom last played for the Los Angeles Clippers during the 2012-2013 season and is no longer attached to any NBA team.\nBelieving in the power of prayer for this beautiful soul. pic.twitter.com/r4u4IM3PWT\n‚Äî Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) October 15, 2015\nPlease pray for Lamar üôè #ourfighter\nA photo posted by @krisjenner on Oct 14, 2015 at 4:51pm PDT\nTop\nLeafs vs. Blue Jackets: One team will get first win\n0\nUniversity student a hit as North Korea's 'dear leader'\n0\nBoxes of Lucky Charms Marshmallows up for grabs\n0\nMaryland teens, wife arrested over love triangle double slaying\n0\nRichard\nAndrea News\nSouth African woman tried to sell baby for $380 0", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/81ksy9G-Mn/", "https://twitter.com/kourtneykardash/status/654716651569438720", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/RealLamarOdom", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://t.co/r4u4IM3PWT"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:23:26.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
