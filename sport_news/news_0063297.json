Haffey / Getty Images) Bill Shaikin Contact Reporter \nThe appeal hearing for Dodgers infielder Chase Utley will not be held Monday and is \"unlikely\" to be held Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly. \nUtley remains eligible to play pending the hearing, so he would be available for the Dodgers in Game 3 of the National League division series Monday night at Citi Field. \nDodgers Manager Don Mattingly said it would \"definitely be a possibility\" that Utley would start. Howie Kendrick has started the first two games of the series at second base for the Dodgers, but Utley has a .333 batting average in 18 career at-bats against Mets starter Matt Harvey. \nSee the most-read stories in Sports this hour >> \nMets shortstop Ruben Tejada suffered a broken leg when Utley upended him on a slide in Saturday's Game 2.
