Tampa Bay Buccaneers sales rose 15 per cent after drafting quarterback Jameis Winston first overall heading into this NFL season.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays saw a 73-per-cent spike in secondary-market ticket sales after the acquisition of ace David Price and all-star shortstop Troy Tulowizki at baseball's trade deadline.\nAn increased demand has driven up the cost of Oilers tickets slightly, with the average ticket price on the secondary market rising to US$156 from $152 a year ago, according to SeatGeek.com , a website that aggregates prices on ticket resales.\nCalgary Flames tickets have also escalated with an average cost of $120 compared to $117 last season, as have Ottawa Senators seats which are now $92 versus $89.\nThe rebuilding Toronto Maple Leafs have seen ticket prices drop nearly 20 per cent from $252 to $194. The Montreal Canadiens' average resale price is $161, down from $164 a year ago. Vancouver Canucks tickets are at $113, down slightly from $115 last season.\nDue to stricter resale laws in Manitoba figures for the Winnipeg Jets are unavailable.\nTop ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://www.stubhub.com/", "http://www.edmontonsun.com/sports/hockey/oilers", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "https://seatgeek.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-01T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:02:29.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
