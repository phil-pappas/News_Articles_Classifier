(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- They had no timeouts, trailed by two points with only 85 seconds left and the end zone sat 65 yards away. And yet there they were after the game -- senior receiver Mason Pack, quarterback Chris Lawson and rusher Malachi Stout each hoisted up on to the shoulders of linemen and surrounded by a swarm of their Kickapoo Chiefs teammates. Heck, Pack even grabbed a bull horn and delivered his best General Patton speech for the road ahead. That’s right, for the road ahead. Because, almost left for playoff dead a couple of times, the Chiefs unbelievably rallied for a 30-26 victory against the Lee’s Summit Tigers in a Class 6 District 4 postseason opener Friday night at Pottenger Stadium. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS The key play? It was one the Chiefs wedged into the playbook only two weeks ago and practiced about nine times, and then dusted off for their first play of their final drive: Lawson and Pack connected on a 32-yard pass – mostly a jump ball on Pack’s part – before Lawson scored the go-ahead touchdown, a 5-yard run, two plays later. The defense eventually thwarted Lee’s Summit’s final drive on a pass play into Kickapoo’s end zone, but more on that later. The Pass that Saved the Season – a possible chapter title on the 2015 highlight video – overshadowed it all. After all, the pass set up Kickapoo’s third go-ahead TD of the game.“Before the play, we called it and I thought to myself, ‘I just have to make this play,’” said Pack, who circled back to catch Lawson’s off-balance, under-thrown heave. “I didn’t want end this season to end with a loss right now. I wasn’t ready for it. I did what I could for my team, and it just worked out. … Everybody played a heck of a game.” Said Lawson, “It’s just an indescribable night. … During the season, we didn’t have to face much adversity. I don’t think we were down but one time during the regular season. We were down half that game. But I think it speaks a lot for our team, that we were able to come back and win this game.” In other words, Friday night was unreal. In fact, Kickapoo is now 10-0 under coach Kurt Thompson, despite appearing to be headed for an early postseason exit after only the fourth play of the second half. At that point, Lee’s Summit quarterback Dalton Hill had ran off a 60-yard touchdown run, throwing Kickapoo into a 23-10 hole. The deficit loomed large, given the Chiefs had been their own worst enemy up to that point. Kickapoo lost three first-half fumbles, including two that effectively cost Kickapoo 10 points – one on a rushing attempt inside Lee’s Summit 10 late in the second quarter, the other a muffed punt that led directly to a Lee’s Summit field goal. And yet all was forgiven, largely because Kickapoo clearly played with a purpose and a sense of urgency throughout the second half. For instance: Stout finished with 133 yards on 25 carries and two touchdowns, including a 35-yard TD run that served as an immediate response to Hill’s touchdown. The Chiefs forced a fumble on the next series, setting up at the Tigers’ 14, and it fed Kickapoo’s go-ahead TD -- a Lawson-to-Pack, 3-yard pass play on fourth-and goal. In essence, the Chiefs sold the scoring play by running Stout and Maverick McGee right, while Pack darted off on a late flag pattern the other way. The Chiefs’ final drive came after Lee’s Summit took a 26-24 advantage with 1:30 left on Daniel Kloncka’s 27-yard field goal, which came 21 plays after the Tigers blocked Kickapoo’s 25-yard field goal attempt. Kickapoo’s desperation, Lawson-to-Pack heave was a play the Chiefs badly needed. They burned their three second-half timeouts in a stretch midway through the second half, including once when a 12th defender was late running off the field. “That team had been in five or six games like that all year. They were used to playing in those games,” Thompson said of Lee’s Summit. “They created so many issues for us defensively, but the kids just kind of stayed in there. You know, we didn’t play very good in the first half, with three fumbles plus a bad snap on a punt (deep in Kickapoo territory). That’s not been us all year. …“We kind of challenged them at halftime. We couldn’t play any worse than we did.” Lawson finished with 132 yards rushing on 14 carries, including the winning TD and two TD passes. Pack, who hauled in three passes, also intercepted a pass early in the game after the poor punt snap resulted in Lee’s Summit taking over at the Kickapoo 28 and the Chiefs trailing 6-0. Pack also was in on the final play of the game – a Hill pass into the front corner of the end zone. Three Chiefs converged, with Kickapoo junior Peyton Moore getting a hand on it to knock down the pass. Lee’s Summit had no choice but to reach the end zone, given a field goal was out of question. The Tigers had missed an extra point kick after the game’s first touchdown. It was a tough way to go for Lee’s Summit (3-7), which got 303 yards rushing as a team. Salvatore Garozzo churned out 126 yards, and Hill finished with 125 yards rushing as well as 215 passing yards on 22 of 30 passing. “It’s the story of our year – these types of games,” Lee’s Summit coach Eric Thomas said. “We’ve competed all year, but we found ways to come up short.” Kickapoo plays host to Lee’s Summit West next Friday in a Class 6 District 4 second-round game.“At halftime, we were kind of bummed, but coaches kept telling us to keep our heads up. We were going to win this game and do whatever it takes,” Pack said. “I’m just happy we got a win.” Kickapoo 30, Lee’s Summit 26 Lee’s Summit 6 10 7 3 – 26 Kickapoo 7 3 14 6 – 30 First quarter LS – Sam Buckner 7 pass from Dalton Hill (kick failed) K – Malachi Stout 13 run (Joshua Scheiderer kick) Second quarter LS – Salvatore Garozzo 3 run (Daniel Klockenga kick) K – FG 36, Scheiderer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:33:06.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
