The property dispute has struck a nerve in a country notorious for super-high rents that critics say are killing vibrancy in cities by spurring gentrification and evictions.\nChoi Jee Ahn of Takeout Drawing said Thursday that about 10 lawsuits have been exchanged between a gallery the artists belong to and their YouTube star landlord.\nPSY bought the building in 2012 and wants to evict the artists on the grounds of a 2011 court ruling that ordered them to move out by 2013. The artists question whether the ruling is still effective when it was based on earlier plans by the building's previous owner to reconstruct it.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:02:00.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
