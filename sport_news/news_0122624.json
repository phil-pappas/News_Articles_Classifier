Security guards will also undergo training programme so that they can prevent and deal with crime against women in the vehicles,\" the official said.\nDTC spokesperson Dr R S Minhas said private security guards will ensure safety in the corporation buses.\nAnother official said the government is mulling over giving walkie-talkies to these security guards so that they can contact each other.\nIn its pre-poll assurance, the Aam Aadmi Party had promised to deploy marshals in buses to ensure safety of women in the national capital.
