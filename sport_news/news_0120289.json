The 444 Boys of Summer who graced Marinelli Field from 1988 through 1999 wearing Rockford's Midwest League uniforms. The last of them retired as active players during the 2014 major league season. Even so, there remains two living connections from the last Rockford Cubbies team (1998) to the 2015 Chicago Cubs â€” Franklin Font, a special assistant to the Cubs coaching staff, and Eric Hinske, the team's assistant hitting coach. Font was the 1998 Cubbies' regular second baseman for the season's first half, hitting .270 in 66 games with five doubles and two triples among his 64 hits. He also drove in 15 runs and stole 25 bases in 31 attempts, third-best on the team. He was promoted to Daytona for the season's second half. Hinske was a 17th-round pick in the 1998 free agent draft. After signing with the Cubs out of the University of Arkansas, the Menasha, Wisconsin, native was assigned to Williamsport, Pennsylvania. There, he hit .298 with nine home runs and 20 doubles and 57 RBIs before earning a promotion to Rockford. In Rockford, he appeared in just six games, splitting time between first base and left field. He left an impression, though, hitting .450 with four doubles and a home run among nine hits with four runs batted in. Font had a lifetime batting average of .290 but showed little pop, with only three home runs in a six-year minor league career, according to baseballreference.com . He had stints as a minor league manager and hitting coach before joining the Cubs in 2012. Hinske was traded to the Oakland organization in 2001 for infielder Miguel Cairo and played in the majors from 2002 through 2013 for the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Rays, Pirates, Yankees, Braves and Diamondbacks. A total of 89 former Rockford players appeared in the major leagues. From 1988-1999, Rockford teams represented the Montreal Expos (1988-92), Kansas City Royals (1993-94), Chicago Cubs (1995-98) and Cincinnati Reds (1999). Three other individuals connect Rockford to this season's baseball playoffs. Joe Siddall, catcher for the 1989 Rockford Expos, is one of the Toronto Blue Jays radio voices. Siddall played in the majors for the Expos, Marlins and Tigers. Mike Jirschle, manager of the 1993 Rockford Royals, is the third base coach for the Kansas City Royals. And Josh Lewin, a radio voice for the New York Mets, spent the summer after his graduation from Northwestern University in 1990 as a newsroom intern for the Rockford Register Star. David Shultz retired from the Register Star after 42 years.
