He said a potential four-division scheduling format for the SCC would have been more appealing to ECC schools, who preferred a more geographically friendly format. Ultimately, that was a factor in leading Fitch and New London to stay. \nNFA's decision to remain in the ECC prompts a three-division format for next season: \nDivision I: NFA, Fitch, East Lyme, New London and Ledyard; Div. II: Bacon Academy, Waterford, Stonington and Montville; Div. III: Killingly, Plainfield, Griswold and Windham. \nECC officials will allow Div. III schools to avoid crossovers to Div. I, leaving NFA, Ledyard, Fitch, East Lyme and New London with six guaranteed conference games next season. They're faced with the unenviable task of finding four nonleague games. \n\"It's a major concern for all of us,\" Swallow said. \nSwallow mentioned the possibility of playing teams from Rhode Island and Massachusetts to fill out schedules. \n\"We'll all need to get creative,\" he said. \nm.dimauro@theday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:22:32.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
