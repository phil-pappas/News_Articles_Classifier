Elections, which became necessary as parties failed to forge a consensus, will take place amid continued protests and blockade of a key border trade point with India over the country's new constitution. Koirala submitted his resignation to President Ram Baran Yadav on Saturday, setting the stage for a vote to elect a new prime minister. Koirala has filed his candidacy from his Nepali Congress (NC) party. Oli is chairman of CPN-UML. His name was proposed by Unified CPN-Maoist chairman Prachanda and seconded by Rastriya Prajatantra Party chairman Kamal Thapa. Oli appears to be currently in the leade, with more than a dozen parties, including Prachanda's UCPN-Maoist, extending support to him. Both Koirala and Oli have filed their nomination papers. Koirala said he had decided to contest the election on his party's directive. The election of the prime minister comes amid opposition to the new constitution, which was unveiled on September 20 after seven years of negotiations, by Madhesi groups. Nepal formed a three-member team headed by foreign minister on Friday to ease a diplomatic standoff with India over the supply of essential goods, including petroleum products, hit due to blockade of trade points with India by the protests. The agitating Madhesi Front claims that the constitution does not guarantee enough rights and representation to the Madhesi and Tharu communities residing in southern Nepal. Madhesis are Indian-origin inhabitants of the Terai region bordering India who are opposed to splitting Nepal into seven provinces. They are against splitting Nepal into seven provinces. The continued blockade of border trade points with India has halted the supply of essential goods from India. At least 40 people have died in over a month of clashes between police and protesters from the Madhesi and Tharu communities and ethnic minorities. â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:17:36.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
