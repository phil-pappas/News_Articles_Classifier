The seventh sack was a strip sack by safety T.J. Ward and a recovery by Von Miller with 29 seconds left.\nOn the winning drive, cornerback Xavier Rhodes was flagged for pass interference and running back C.J. Anderson ripped a 13-yard run up the gut to get Denver into field goal range. The Broncos entered the game as the only 3-0 team in NFL history not to rush for at least 70 yards in a game. But they ended that streak in the first half when backup running back Ronnie Hillman took a toss sweep 72 yards for a touchdown.\nBlair Walsh hooked a 38-yard field goal attempt wide left one play before Hillman's score.\nAdrian Peterson ran for 81 yards, including a 48-yard touchdown run to get the Vikings within 20-17.\nThe Vikings fell to 2-8 on the road under coach Mike Zimmer. But they're 2-2 with a bye week to help starters Charles Johnson (rib) and Andrew Sendejo (knee) heal. Then they play the Chiefs at home before traveling to Detroit to play a Lions team they beat by 10 points in Week 2.\n(c)2015 Star Tribune (Minneapolis)\nVisit the Star Tribune (Minneapolis) at www.startribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732600&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732600&h=Vikings+edged+by+Broncos%2C+23%2D20", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732600"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:13:16.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
