During the winning streak CHPC has played improved defense, allowing teams only a combined 57 points. \nDavid said the Jays have had some teachable defensive moments this week, learning the intricacies of the Hornets’ Flex-Bone style of offense. \n“You have to get your kids to realize this is going to be about playing assignment defense. They are doing a good job offensively at this point and their quarterback has been playing well and adapting to what they are trying to do. \n“It’s an offense where you have to play your assignments and you have to be responsible for the quarterback and the fullback. They are going to make big plays if each guy on defense doesn’t do his job,” David said. \nDavid said the Jays have seen similar versions of the Hornets’ offense , which is similar to Georgia Tech, so the recognition is not as difficult. \nSt. Edmund (2-4, 1-0) ended a three-game losing streak last week with a 50-0 district victory over False River Academy. \n“We played a lot better overall. If we can eliminate the turnovers the rest of the way we are going to be all right,” said David. \nSt. Edmund’s losses have come against Northwest High, Port Barre, Opelousas Catholic and Beau Chene, teams that are in higher classifications. \nThe four schools that have defeated St. Edmund currently have 17-7 cumulative records. \nThe Jays have thrown for 1,311 yards behind senior quarterback Drake Brunet. St. Edmund is averaging only 85.7 yards rushing per game. \nBrunet’s top targets have been running back Gibson Lafleur (47 receptions, 701 yards, 5 touchdowns), Cole Bergeron (26-144) and Will Chachere (13-206). \nLafleur has rushed for 238 yards and a 5.9 yard-per-carry average. \nDavid said Lafleur’s performances this season haven’t surprised him. \n“He’s been an excellent ball player for us since he was a freshman. He’s a good overall athlete and a great football player,” said David. \nLike most of the Jays, Lafleur plays nearly the entire game. When he’s not running the football or catching Brunet’s passes, Lafleur is playing middle linebacker.
