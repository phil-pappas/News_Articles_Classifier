He became just the second rookie since 2000 to record that triple. \nWilson completed 10 of his first 12 passes and finished with 235 yards but also threw a pair of interceptions and was sacked five times. \nHis opposite number Colin Kaepernick had a tough night against the Seahawks defence and was sacked six times, completing 13 of 24 passes for 124 yards. \nSeattle defensive end Michael Bennett recorded a career best 3.5 sacks. \nAll the 49ers could muster was a third quarter Phil Dawson field goal and Hauschka then booted his second three-pointer of the night in the final quarter to complete the scoring.
