Nikki Haley have asked the state Supreme Court to throw out an order that requires the Legislature to come up with a plan by Feb. 1 to provide adequate education for children in poor and rural areas. \nTo stay up-to-date on South Carolina politics, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android . In a motion filed Monday with the Supreme Court, Senate President Pro Tempore Hugh Leatherman, House Speaker Jay Lucas and Haley argued that the court is overstepping its authority and committing “an egregious violation of separation of powers” through its Sept. 24 order. The state’s leaders also argued that the court’s deadline is “arbitrary” and presents “logistical difficulties” because it “hijacks the legislative process.” “Although theoretically possible, it is unrealistic to think legislation of this magnitude, importance and complexity can be introduced in one chamber, go through the committee process where the public could provide invaluable input, pass the originating chamber, repeat the process in the other chamber, have the chambers agree on any amendments, and then be considered by the Governor by the February 1 deadline,” the motion read. Lucas, R-Hartsville, spoke Monday to the East Cooper Republican Club Lunch, where he said he was optimistic the court would reconsider the order. He added the path of the past few months has shown that all sides want to get things done and show progress. “I think they will see that it benefits everyone to allow us to continue to work together,” Lucas said. This isn’t the first time the state has fought the court’s orders or the justices’ November ruling in the 22-year-old Abbeville lawsuit. The scathing, almost year-old ruling criticized the state, Legislature and poor districts for “creating school districts filled with students of the most disadvantaged socioeconomic background, exposing students in those schools to substandard educational inputs, and then maintaining that nothing can be done to improve those school districts unacceptable performances.” When the court refused, Lucas and Leatherman, R-Florence, created legislative panels that are working to have the General Assembly comply with the ruling . But the districts that sued asked in June for a deadline for the Legislature from the Supreme Court. The court’s response was the Sept. 24 order, which came with several target dates, including an Oct. 15 deadline calling for the creation of a panel of experts that would review the plan to improve the schools and prepare a written report for the court. In the motion, the state’s leaders refer to the panel of experts as a “super panel,” and their responsibility an “impermissible delegation of legislative authority.” Carl Epps, the attorney representing the school districts that sued, said on Monday that legislative leaders mischaracterized the panel of experts in the motion because the panel’s opinion is non-binding. He added, however, that he intended to eliminate the state’s concerns by asking the court to do away with the target dates outlined in the Sept. 24 order. “I’ll be pleased to ask the court to eliminate the interim deadlines so as long as we have final legislation and programs in place by the end of the (2016 legislative) session,” Epps said. “The response will attempt to eliminate their concerns.” Schuyler Kropf contributed to this report.
