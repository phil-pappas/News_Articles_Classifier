(AP) The Big Ten officials' organization says a third-quarter officiating mistake cost Illinois a down in its 14-13 win Saturday over Nebraska. \nCollegiate Officiating Consortium Coordinator of Officials Bill Carollo said Monday that replay officials should have given Illinois another down when they reviewed a situation in which field officials lost track of the down and distance. \nInstead the play that Illinois thought was third down was judged to be fourth down. Illinois had to turn over the ball at its own 44-yard line. \nCarollo said ''errors of this nature have a significant impact on game assignments, bowl assignments and overall year end status.'' \nIllinois defensive end Dawuane Smoot said Monday the mistake motivated the crowd and defense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:21:07.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
