This year, Wilson surpassed that total midway through the first quarter with 94 yards on 11 of 15 passing. For the night he ended up with 297 yards on 26 of 36 completions with two touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\"We knew their defense was tough and going into this game we wanted to take shots and make some big plays and I trusted my guys to make big plays,'' said Wilson.\nWhen asked why his team went to the air, coach Kyle Whittingham said, \"Because their run defense is so tough. Last year we should have (passed more) and we didn't want to make the same mistake twice.''\nBy halftime, Wilson had more than doubled that total with 220 yards on 18 of 24 passing. Two of the passes went for touchdowns, a 2-yarder to Harrison Handley in the first quarter and an 11-yarder to Kenneth Scott in the second. He added 57 yards passing in the third quarter.\nWilson hit nine different receivers in the first half alone with two Utes, freshman receiver Raelon Singleton and junior tight end Ken Hampel catching the first passes of their Ute careers. Meanwhile, Booker was bottled up by an ASU defense that often put eight men on the line in an effort to stop Utah’s top offensive weapon.\nBooker, who ran for 222 yards last week, came into the game ranked No. 9 in the country in rushing yardage, but could only manage 21 yards in the first half against the ASU defense. He had just 24 yards total before his 25-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter to put Utah ahead 21-18. A 62-yard touchdown run with 1:11 left put him over the 100-yard mark for the 11th time in his career.\nRAINY WEATHER: After perfect weather for the first three home games of the season, the Utes were worried about poor weather for Saturday night’s game. A front came in Saturday afternoon and produced rain in Salt Lake before clearing up a couple of hours before kickoff.\nHowever, just after the start of the second quarter, a sheet of rain coming from the south hit Rice-Eccles Stadium and continued throughout much of the rest of the game.\nHACKETT PLAY: Tom Hackett kept up his good punting, averaging 46.9 yards per kick and leaving five punts inside the 20.\nHowever his most important play of the night came on his third punt when De’Chavon Hayes got loose on a punt return and went 48 yards before the last man, Hackett, tripped him up at the Utah 13-yard line. It turned out to be a huge play at the time, as the Sun Devils couldn’t score a touchdown and had to settle for a field goal.\nEXTRA POINTS: Chase Hansen, the Utes’ third-string quarterback, saw action in the third quarter at safety, wearing jersey No. 22 instead of 15. He also played on the Ute special teams  The Utes came out in black jerseys and red pants with shiny “satin” red helmets. The helmets had “Ute Proud” decals on them, and members of the Ute Tribe attending the game performed at halftime.  Ute tight end Siale Fakailoatonga went out early in the first quarter with a left knee injury.  Demario Richard, the Sun Devils’ leading rusher on the year with 529 yards, was a game-time decision because of an injured knee, but he didn’t play as Kalen Ballage got most of the carries for ASU.  Attendance was 46,192, the 35th consecutive home sellout.  Two Rose Bowl scouts wearing their blue blazers were on hand for the game.  Also, NFL scouts from Detroit, Cleveland, Baltimore, Indianapolis and New Orleans were present for the game.  Saturday’s game was the sixth straight night game of the season for the Utes.  Game time was set for 8 p.m. but it actually started at 8:20 p.m.  Utah’s last win was a 31-28 victory in 1976 in Tempe. The last home victory over ASU was in 1973 when the Utes won 36-31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:34:40.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
