The Panthers (5-2, 3-1) will visit Badger Stadium and face off with the Badgers on AllCare Field beginning at 7 p.m. with a forecasted 80 percent chance of rain. “Ashdown has fast kids on the football field,” Arkadelphia head football coach J.R. Eldridge said. “They two pick-6s against Mena for their 26 points, so we are going to have to secure the football and not give them those kinds of opportunities. They have the ability to hurt you with their speed.” Tashnick Bishop has quarterbacked the Panthers to wins over Little Rock Hall (46-14), De Queen (28-19), Mena (26-7), Bauxite (51-13) and Malvern (20-14) at home. Ashdown dropped a 23-6 decision to Hope in Week 2 and lost 37-18 to Nashville last week. Arkadelphia defeated Mena 23-15 to improve to 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the 7-4A conference. The Badgers are currently in a favorable third place in the league behind Nashville, who is undefeated at 4-0, then Ashdown, Malvern and Fountain Lake are all tied with identical records 5-2 and 3-1. “Really none of that matters to us, we are focused soley on Ashdown,” Eldridge said. “They have more of a multiple set offensively than they have had in the past and defensively their line is better and more disciplined. They have a system they run and they are good at it.” Runners Bryson Haskins and fullback Kirklon Threadgill lead the rushing attack for Ashdown. Last week the Badgers led 20-0 on Mena before a long touchdown pass before the first half ended made it a 20-7 game. “Really in the first half expect that touchdown pass, we were good,” Eldridge said. “We missed a play on the ball, which is something we work on every day in practice. And our kickoff coverage has to be better. Then we had a cut-block that wasn’t a cut-block that took a touchdown away from us in the third quarter or the score would have been a lot different.” Quarterback Jeff Blake led the Badgers last week with two touchdown passes to Shemar Dickens and Tajhan McKenzie had a 56-yard touchdown run. Nathan Warner kicked a 31-yard field goal to push the Arkadelphia lead to 23-7 before Mena scored and made a 2-point conversion late in the fourth quarter. “The biggest thing for us is be honed in on making the fewest mistakes,” Eldridge said. “Our foremost objective is to beat Ashdown.” Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. on Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:54:44.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
