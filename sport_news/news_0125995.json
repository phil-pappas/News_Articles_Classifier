Deebo Samuel did not practice today. Chris Lammons is expected to play. #Gamecocks #UofSC — Willie Smith (@willie_t_smith) October 1, 2015 \nReceiver Deebo Samuel was held out of practice again. He's been plagued by a hamstring issue for virtually the entire season. Due to the trickiness of the actual injury, a minor tweak could set anyone back for weeks. As such, freshman D.J. Neal will likely start in his place. Neal has registered one catch on the season for 15 yards. Samuel out, Elder was limited. Lammons should be OK. — David Cloninger (@DCTheState) October 1, 2015 \nCorner Chris Lammons will likely suit up. The sophomore had been battling a knee injury, and will be a welcomed sight for a secondary plagued by some consistency issues early in 2015. Better news: #Gamecocks C Alan Knott is no longer walking with a crutch. Could be a hopeful sign for Vanderbilt game. — David Caraviello (@dcaraviello) October 1, 2015 \nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
