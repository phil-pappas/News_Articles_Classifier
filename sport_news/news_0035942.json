Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a coalition against prison and jail expansion, released its annual “decarceration” report card Thursday that gave several counties a failing grade. Tuolumne County was listed as “in danger of failing” for seeking a costly project to build a new jail. “Counties are signing up for decades of debt, and that just includes construction costs,” said Lizzie Buchen, state coordinator for CURB. “That doesn’t include operating costs.” According to the group, 23 of the state’s 58 counties are building new jails, five are building two or more jails and 32 are applying for new state funds earmarked for jail construction. Much of the construction has emerged since the state Legislature passed Assembly Bill 109 in response to a 2010 court ruling that overcrowding in California prisons had become unconstitutional. The legislation aimed to reduce the number of prisoners by lowering sentences for certain felonies, making county probation departments responsible for supervising parolees deemed “non-violent, non-sexual and non-serious,” and setting aside funds for counties to implement programs as alternatives to incarceration. Since the legislation — also known as the 2011 Public Safety Realignment — took effect, California has authorized $2.2 billion to finance construction of new county jails, the CURB report stated. “What we found is that counties are failing to take advantage of this opportunity in California,” Buchen said. “Specifically, they are reinforcing their reliance on incarceration by expanding old jails and building new ones.” Tuolumne County has received $33 million from the state to replace the old jail at 175 Yaney Avenue in Sonora, which was constructed in 1961. Another $11 million for the jail will be funded by the county through a mix of one-time funds, internal borrowing and outside loans, according to the county’s funding plan. The new jail is intended to improve conditions for inmates and employees, while expanding the number of beds from 147 to 216. Long before AB 109 was passed, the county’s jail was criticized in numerous Tuolumne County Grand Jury reports for being too cramped and outdated. “We had numerous jail needs, grand jury reports and technical reports by a variety of specialty firms that deal with corrections saying we needed a new jail,” said County Administrator Craig Pedro. Chief Probation Officer Adele Arnold is scheduled to present a report to the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors at Tuesday’s meeting that looks at the effectiveness of county programs funded by AB 109 since 2011, including the day reporting center, work release and electronic monitoring. The day reporting center at 1194 Highway 49 in Sonora, operated by contractor BI Inc., provides an intensive supervision and treatment program for offenders released from prison, or who would have been sent to prison prior to AB 109. According to the probation department’s report, about 102 out of 224 people between January 2012 and June 2015 successfully completed the program. The overall 46 percent success rate is nearly double that of other counties in Central California, including Calaveras, Fresno, Kern, Madera and Merced. The employment rate among those who successfully went through the county’s day reporting center since 2012 was 33 percent, the report stated. Meanwhile, the county’s electronic monitoring program has seen a success rate of 86 percent out of 234 cases since July 2013. The county’s work release program, used as an alternative to jail, has seen more than 2,100 referrals since 2012, according to the report. Probation officers oversee work-release crews that do projects throughout the county, including groundskeeping, fire breaks and work for area schools and nonprofits. Buchen argued that the need for new jails would be reduced if fewer people were incarcerated prior to sentencing, most of whom are too poor to afford bail. She said the pretrial population in county jails throughout the state represents two-thirds of the total inmates. In June, 114 of the 147 inmates in Tuolumne County Jail had yet to be sentenced. Out of the total population, 133 had been arrested on felony charges. The probation department’s report stated that Tuolumne County Superior Court judges had released 138 defendants from jail on their own recognize prior to trial between October 2014 and September 2015. In the same period, 411 sentenced inmates were released early due to overcrowding. \nArnold could not be reached for comment but is scheduled to give her presentation to the board at 10:30 a.m. The meeting starts at 9 a.m., in the County Administration Center, 2 S. Green St., Sonora. Also at Tuesday’s meeting, the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider: • Awarding a $92,775 contract to KASL Consulting Engineering Inc. for a rehabilitation study on the wastewater collection system in the township of Tuolumne, funded by a federal Community Development Block Grant. • Authorizing county staff to apply for up to $450,000 in funding through the state Department of Housing and Community Development to provide housing relocation assistance for people with dry wells due to the drought. \n• Hold a public hearing at 11 a.m. to provide direction to county staff on options for future ambulance system operations. The county has contracted with a Manteca company for ambulance services since 1987. \n• Hold a series of public hearings starting at 1:30 p.m. to consider: Submitting an application for $750,000 in federal CDBG funding to connect up to about 41 homes with dry wells to the Tuolumne Utilities District water system; approving plans and specifications for an estimated $1.2 million project to install a stoplight at Tuolumne and Standard roads; and approving annual rate increases for trash collection as required by the county’s contract with Waste Management.
