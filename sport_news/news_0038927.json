But NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis’ diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3). \n“How long has it been since Aaron’s thrown an interception here, 500 attempts? We said what we need to do (was) someone needs to get their hand on the football, get the ball and someone make a play,” Rams coach Jeff Fisher said. \nIt happened two more times: Rodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third. \n“All of them,” Rodgers said when asked which turnover bothered him the most. \n“Well, I mean, Aaron is human,” said Packers coach Mike McCarthy. “He’s still a remarkable player. What happened today doesn’t change that.” \nThe defense backed up Rodgers with big plays all day long. \nRelentless pressure on Foles helped keep the Packers (5-0) unbeaten. Foles’ four interceptions were a career worst, with two coming in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10. \nFoles was 11-of-30 for 141 yards and a touchdown. His longest completion came on a 68-yarder to Stedman Bailey late in the fourth quarter. \nOtherwise, the Packers’ pass rush overwhelmed an inexperienced offensive line that lost veteran guard Rodger Saffold in the first quarter to a shoulder injury. Green Bay linebacker Clay Matthews had 11/2 sacks. \n“It still is an offensive team, but it’s nice when the defense can hold their own, especially in the last couple of weeks when opposition is having a big defense and maybe our offense isn’t clicking,” Matthews said. \nRookie cornerback Quinten Rollins returned an interception 45 yards for a touchdown for a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, and picked off another pass at the 7 with 23 seconds left. Safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix intercepted a tipped pass in the end zone on third-and-goal at the 7. \n“I think we just all complement each other well, offense, defense, special teams,” Rollins said. “All three games complement each other well, so that makes the game a lot easier.” \nGreg Zuerlein was 1-for-4 on field-goal tries, hitting from 42 but missing two others and getting a fourth one blocked. The misses all came from at least 50 yards. \nThe mistakes wasted another strong effort for Rams rookie Todd Gurley, who for the second straight week had his best production, with 159 yards rushing on 30 carries. \n“We’ve just got to be consistent and to finish,” Gurley said. “Put some points on the board — a field goal, something.” \nBut a week after defeating previously unbeaten Arizona, the Rams couldn’t repeat the feat on a warm fall afternoon in Green Bay. \n“We’re running the football right now. We’re 1-1 since Todd’s got his opportunity, so we just need to keep improving,” Fisher said. \nThe Packers’ defense held up in spite of losing tackle B.J. Raji to a groin injury and linebacker Nick Perry (shoulder). Guard T.J. Lang also left in the first quarter with a knee injury. \nFor the Rams, defensive lineman Chris Long did not return after hurting his right knee in the first half. \nNotes: Laurinaitis finished with a team-high eight tackles. … CB Trumaine Johnson had the Rams’ other interception. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:31:03.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
