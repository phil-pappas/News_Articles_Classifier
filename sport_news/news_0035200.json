Scientists and research scholars from a number of universities from within the state and various parts of the country would discussing the consequences of climate change during the three-day congress. In his inaugural address, the Governor, who is also Chancellor of the university, welcomed the participants and observed that holding an annual science congress was an important occasion for the scientific community and the university. He observed that the regular organisation of such an important event contributed towards the creation of an environment which was helpful in promoting scientific temper in universities and across society. The Governor observed that rising temperatures and non-traditional climatic changes across the globe were a serious fallout of the phenomenon of global warming and its consequences had started becoming visible in the form of receding glaciers, floods and other disasters. Quoting the example of last year’s devastating floods in the state, the Governor said the consequences of climate change had been posing as enormous financial and rehabilitation challenges for the people and governments. Noting that between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the population was dependent on agriculture and its allied activities, the Governor said the climate change phenomenon would adversely affect the ongoing efforts to usher in a second green revolution. “If we do not produce new seeds and plants which are capable of withstanding higher temperatures and fail to evolve practical strategies to increase crop production and productivity, there will be a disastrous crisis arising out of foodgrain shortages within the country,” he observed. The Governor congratulated Sheikh Javed Ahmed, dean research, Kashmir University, for winning American fellowship for his excellent research work in the field of physics and lauded the research work of Prof Ramshoo, head, geology and earth sciences, Kashmir University, in the field of climate change. The Governor said he looked forward to the time when a major part of the Kashmir University faculty would be widely recognised within and outside the country for their high-quality valuable research. The Governor stressed that for optimally utilising all intellectual and scientific resources available within the universities and major scientific institutions within J&K, it was essential that there were meaningful inter-institutional linkages both within and beyond the state and identified projects were undertaken to tackle varied problems facing the state. The Governor hoped that at the end of this conference, some practical recommendations would be made on how to deal with the emerging challenges arising from the climate change and wished all the participants useful and profitable discussions. Earlier, Khurshid Iqbal Andrabi, Vice-Chancellor, Kashmir University, in his welcome address, highlighted the achievements of the university in obtaining national and international fellowships and spoke about the ongoing researches on the campus. Sheikh Javed Ahmed presented the introductory address. MA Wani, dean academic affairs, proposed the vote of thanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:08:38.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
