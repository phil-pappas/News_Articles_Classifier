They scored late to take a 13-9 victory in Charlotte on Oct. 26, 2014. However, the most memorable meetings have come in the playoffs, both also won by Seattle — a 34-14 victory at CenturyLink Field in the NFC title game in 2006 and a 31-17 win in a divisional playoff game in January. \nEarly line: Seahawks by 7. \nKey players: \nQB Cam Newton: The fifth-year quarterback remains one of the more versatile players in football, with at least 3,000 passing yards and 500 rushing yards in each of his first four seasons. He has accounted for all but one of Carolina’s offensive touchdowns this season with seven passes and two on the ground — the team’s only two rushing touchdowns. He has a passer rating of 88.5, 19th in the NFL, and has rushed for 195 yards on 43 attempts. \nRB Jonathan Stewart: The former University of Oregon and Timberline High School standout has battled injuries much of the past three seasons, playing in 28 of a possible 48 games. But he has been healthy in 2015 and leads the Panthers with 220 yards on 59 carries. Stewart ran well in both games against the Seahawks last season with 79 yards on 16 carries in the regular-season meeting, and 70 on 13 in the divisional-playoff game at CenturyLink Field. \nLB Luke Kuechly: Regarded by some as the NFL’s best middle linebacker, Kuechly has played only two quarters this season due to a concussion suffered in the season opener. But the team has targeted this week for his return. Rivera told local reporters last week that Kuechly could return to practice Tuesday (the team had a bye last week). Still, The Charlotte Observer reported it would be unlikely that Kuechly plays every snap as he works back into shape. Among those who have filled in for Kuechly is former University of Washington standout Shaq Thompson, a rookie. \nCB Josh Norman: The fourth-year player from Coastal Carolina was named as the NFC’s Defensive Player of the Month thanks to four interceptions, which is tied with Charles Woodson for the NFL lead. Norman returned two for touchdowns. Two came off Tampa Bay rookie Jameis Winston on a day the Panthers had four for the game. Norman had just three interceptions in 37 games before this season. \nCarolina’s keys to success: One key has been playing bad teams. The four opponents — Jacksonville, Houston, New Orleans and Tampa Bay — have a 5-15 total record. Another is the defense, which has statistically ranked among the NFL’s best. Carolina is allowing 4.7 yards per play, third-lowest in the NFL, and has a plus-eight turnover ratio that is the best in the league. The turnover number includes eight interceptions, tied for second in the NFL. The Panthers also are allowing 5.7 yards per pass, tied for the best in the NFL. Offensively, the Panthers have a serviceable running game led by Stewart and Newton. And though the team is without receiver Kelvin Benjamin (out for the year because of a knee injury), Newton has solid targets in Ted Ginn Jr. (averaging 17.2 yards per reception) and tight end Greg Olsen (17 receptions, 243 yards).
