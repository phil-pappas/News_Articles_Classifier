Christian Academy of Knoxville hasn’t scored fewer than 32 points this season en route to a No. 2 state ranking in Class 3A. Clinton, which snapped a three-game skid by routing Lenoir City last week, has surrendered 42 or more points three times this season. CAK feels it has a defense capable of reaching a state championship. How well the Warriors contain Clinton senior quarterback Tyler Thackerson, who has accounted for 28 TDs (19 passing, nine rushing), will give insight into the unit’s legitimacy.\nPrepXtra Pick: CAK 42, Clinton 24\nPowell (0-6) at Karns (1-5): Karns won’t have a better opportunity to end its skid against Powell than it does on Thursday. The Beavers haven’t beaten the Panthers since 2009, nor have they posted double-digit wins since 2011, but face their annual rival in a homecoming game that was moved from Friday. Powell has maintained a mental edge in this series, even after losing 13 consecutive games and 18 of its past 19. Its lone victory during that stretch came against Karns last season. Both offenses should move the ball effectively on Thursday. Karns coach Tobi Kilgore contends the Beavers are as healthy as they have been since a Week 2 win over South-Doyle. Karns running back Devin Harper, an Oklahoma State commitment, was practically unstoppable in that game. Expect him to have a major impact against Powell.\nPrepXtra Pick: Karns 28, Powell 21\nMcMinn County (3-3) at Oak Ridge (6-1): Another game moved from Friday, Oak Ridge is averaging 48 points per contest over the past four weeks, enough for it to surge to fifth in the Class 5A state rankings. Freshman running back Jordan Graham has provided a spark, and senior running back T.J. Allison accounted for four TDs last week against Karns. Expect junior wide receiver Tee Higgins to bounce back after being held without a touchdown last week for the first time this season.\nPrepXtra Pick: Oak Ridge 42, McMinn County 17\nOther game: Stone Memorial over Sequoyah\nNick Carboni’s Picks\nCAK over Clinton; Karns over Powell; Oak Ridge over McMinn County; Stone Memorial over Sequoyah", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zsJHL-1cUT58.kQQGZr2F_cWk&z=16"], "published": "2015-10-08T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:18:10.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
