Sporting is tied with Seattle and one point ahead of San Jose and the cutoff heading into the regular-season finale.\nSporting had an opportunity to claim one of the two remaining berths in the West on Wednesday, but it fell 2-0 at home to Colorado - Kansas City's first home loss to the Rapids since September 2002.\n\"I know that you're not always going to win every game, but I also know that you have to come out with a certain approach and intent. And we didn't do that,\" coach Peter Vermes said. \"We weren't right in that environment, and it's hard to understand why because to me these are the easy games to play.\n\"You know when something's on the line that it's time to go, and we didn't have that.\"\nThat will need to change Sunday since failing to beat the Galaxy (14-10-9) could put Kansas City out of the postseason for the first time since 2010.\n\"It's a final,\" Vermes said. \"We're in the playoffs: we're playing a play-in game to get in the playoffs. That's what we're doing. We just happen to be playing it at home. It's that simple; there's nothing else to read into it.\"\nScoring has become a major problem for SKC, who have two goals in their last five games (1-3-1) and none in the past two.\nDom Dwyer, the team leader with 11 goals, has just two in his last seven games. The forward hasn't scored in two career matchups with Los Angeles, mustering just one shot on target.\nBenny Feilhaber is also having a tough time getting on the score sheet as his bid for league MVP honors fades. The midfield playmaker has no goals or assists in four games, and he's been held to two of each over the last 10.\nFeilhaber assisted on a goal by Krisztian Nemeth in the last meeting with the Galaxy on April 18, but Kansas City gave up a goal to Omar Gonzalez late in stoppage time to fall 2-1.\nSporting is 2-3-1 in its last six matchups with Los Angeles, but it's unbeaten in six at home (3-0-3).\nThe Galaxy have already clinched a playoff spot but need a victory to assure themselves of the second seed in the conference and a bye to the West semifinals.\nEarning that spot may require solving their recent defensive issues. The Galaxy have surrendered 12 goals in the past four games and are 1-3-2 in their last six.\nThe defense was dreadful last Sunday, giving up five second-half goals in a 5-2 defeat to Portland.\n\"Some guys are making mistakes. Without me making an advertisement or printing posters some guys individually have made some bad mistakes that cost us goals,\" coach Bruce Arena told the team's official website. \"Everything can be better.\"\nRobbie Keane , however, is doing his part. The reigning MLS MVP has four goals and one assist in the last three games after tallying twice against the Timbers. His 19 goals on the season match his total from last year and have come in six fewer games.\nGiovani Dos Santos hasn't been nearly as productive, scoring once in six games after finding the net twice in his first three games since joining Los Angeles from Spain's Villarreal .\nSports & Recreation Kansas City Sporting Kansas City Los Angeles Galaxy Los Angeles   43815/73864   3144/4545   9182/11364  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:23:53.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
