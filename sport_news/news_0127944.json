He knows how excitement surrounding a junior high school athlete sometimes spreads like wildfire. \nHe left the gridiron at the end of the 2005 season and became the boys golf coach in 2011. \nThe first junior high golfer he ever heard about on the job he knew very little about. Tom Goodman built quite a reputation among private school families at New Hebron Christian School, but in Robinson public school circles he was an outlier. \n“He was just this real little, tiny kid,” Roche said, which Goodman still is. “First day of practice we go and play, and he's just on it. Solid golf game from the beginning. … He was our best player.” \nGoodman, now a senior, has played the part every bit as well as some predicted four years ago. At 10:27 a.m. today, Goodman will tee off at his third Class 1A state tournament at Prairie Vista Golf Course in Bloomington. There, he finished 17th and 19th as a sophomore and junior. \nHe's in the last foursome to start off the first tee today after posting the second-lowest sectional score in the state, a 1-over 72 to medal on Monday. \nLast week, he won the Robinson Regional shooting a 76 – five strokes better than second place. \n“What I've done this year is a massive improvement,” Goodman said. “I didn't just qualify, I won the tournaments. I'm coming in, additionally, with a lot more confidence and the most experience I'm ever going to have in my high school career.” \nGoodman started hitting plastic golf balls around his parents' house when he was 2 years old. He has been honing a skillset built to win ever since. \n*** \nGoodman has lived in the same old farm house on a large plot of land south of rural Robinson since he was born. For almost as long, he has used it as a private practice facility. \nBy his measure, the yard is about 220 to 230 yards from one end to the other, and it's surrounded by fields. He sees a golf course ripe for divots. \n“When I see a giant space like that, and I have for many years now, I'll take the clubs out and some balls and hit the ball around the yard,” Goodman said. “It's a gigantic practice area I can go out at my own convenience.” \nBut it's more than that. He and his dad, who introduced him to the sport, make a game out of it. \n“We have landmarks around the yard that we like to hit to,” Goodman said. “We have a couple trees. We also have a tire swing and a couple little bushes. We also have flower pots. \n“Our trash can and our mailbox are pretty popular targets. My dad and I go out and play on occasion and we get pretty creative.” \nOne of Goodman's earliest memories, captured on home video, is of him smacking the ball around the yard as a youngster while his dad follows closely behind offering advice and encouragement. \n“Probably the biggest influence for me is my dad,” Goodman said. “He's the one who originally showed me the game. He was always responsible for furnishing me with clubs and tips and encouraging me.” \n*** \nGoodman always manufactures a game plan no matter how much or how little he knows about a course. \nAt Union County Country Club in Anna for the sectional, his plan worked to perfection. He was even par through 17 holes. Although he bogeyed the 18th, he still won by one stroke. \n“He usually has it pretty well figured out how he wants to play a course,” Roche said. “I just kind of stay out of his way. Where I'm going to help coach him, walking along with him at state, is just shoot the range finder and tell him the distances. \nGoodman has figured out he plays his best when he settles into a way to attack a golf course. So during a practice round, or whenever he has an opportunity, he'll walk a course. \n“A lot of the times I play, I like to go out and look at the course and get a really good idea of how I want to play the course and try to follow the plan I make,” Goodman said. \n“I go through, hole by hole, and I'll look at every single shot that I could end up hitting. I go to the tee box and think, 'What am I trying to accomplish here with this shot?' And I also look at the greens and see where you can hit the ball onto the green in relation to the flag to setup a good putt. \n“It's really just scouting. I've been playing this game so long, so I know what I should be trying to do on every hole. \n*** \nGoodman has family that lives north of Bloomington, so he was introduced to Prairie Vista long before any of his three trips to the state tournament. \n“He likes the course they play at state,” Roche said. “He's been able to play Prairie Vista for a long time. He's seen the course. He knows it.\" \nDuring the last two years, his performances at state have shown a comfort with the course and an ability to finish strong. \nIn 2013, he shot a first-round 81 and followed it up with a 77 that jumped him 19 spots on the leaderboard into 17th place – his best finish. \nLast year, after slipping into the field as the last-place qualifier at his sectional – a spot he had to win in a playoff – he opened with an 82 but gained 13 spots to finish 19th with a second-round 76. \n“I've been there before – I have a pretty good idea of what I'm working with,” Goodman said. “I do have family that lives in the area. That also has led to me playing the course outside of actual competition, which has allowed me to develop a familiarity with the course. But it also suits my game.” \nGoodman doesn't expect to blow the field away with a scoring binge, but wants to put himself in position with mistake-free golf. \n“I'm kind of a steady player,” Goodman said. “I make a lot of pars and that really fits that golf course. If you go out and make a bunch of pars, maybe an occasional birdie or even bogey, then you're going to shoot a good round.” \namcnamee@herald-review.com|(217) 421-6970", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:39:33.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
