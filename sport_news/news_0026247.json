He's had help -- with a group of receivers unmatched in the Central State 8 and a big-play running back in Salat Al-Nurridin -- but Dehority is the the leader of a team that has a shot at a first-round home game if it wins its final three games of the regular season. \nDehority, now a junior, is the area's leading passer with 1,509 yards passing and 21 touchdowns for the 4-2 Panthers. \n\"We started working that passing game as soon as summer started because we knew that we were going to have to have that going every Friday,\" Eisenhower coach Drew Wagers said. \"It's really paid off. \n\"Cayleb has really matured -- he's grown and he's learned the game. And he's meshed with all the other offensive players. \n\"He has a rhythm right now. He feels comfortable back there. He sits back there and keeps his eyes downfield. He doesn't get scared.\" Thrown into the fire \nAt the end of his first career start at quarterback, Maroa-Forsyth sophomore Kameron Boline needed to lead the Trojans on a game-winning drive. \nWith 7:37 to go at the 29-yard line and trailing 9-6 against Monticello last Friday, the Trojans needed to move the ball. \nBoline showed some grit and got the Trojans in position to score. His pass on a 4th-and-9 play with 2:21 to go was intercepted by the Sages' Jacob Burton. \nOn the drive, Boline rushed three times for 14 yards. He completed 5 of 13 passes for 31 yards, converting a 3rd-and-9 and 4th-and-10 along the way. \n\"He's going to be a good one,\" Maroa coach Josh Jostes said. \"It's a tough spot to be in ... He was solid and will only get better every week.\" New receiver in play \nMoving Brandon Price from wide receiver to quarterback has enabled Mount Zion to do some things differently on offense. \nIt challenges defenses with more of a dual-threat quarterback, for one, but it also cleared the path for Keegan Robinson to replace Price at receiver. \nRobinson, a 6-foot, 175 pound senior, brings the same physical play as Price did through the first five weeks of the season. He has given the smaller, quicker receiver, Sammy Schultz, to move back outside. \n\"We love Sammy Schultz, he's a great kid for us, a great receiver, but by moving Brandon to quarterback, Keegan Robinson comes onto the field and he's a little more physical and can help out on the perimeter with blocking and different things,\" Braves coach Mike Popovich said. \nRobinson had two catches for 33 yards last Friday against Charleston. Schultz had four grabs for 29 yards and two touchdowns. Measuring stick \nMount Zion's change at quarterback was a direct result of the loss to Taylorville on Sept. 25 when the Braves only managed six points. \nIt looked like a smart move since Price looked so good against Charleston (12-for-13, 196 yards, 5 TDs), but the Trojans are a winless team this season. \nThe truth is, the Braves probably won't meet a team as good as Taylorville until the playoffs, so they won't be able to perfectly compare how much better the Price-led offense is to when JJ Aldridge was running the show. \nBut Popovich isn't sleeping on this week's opponent, Salem (1-5). \n\"Salem's going to give us all we can handle,\" Popovich said. \nSalem's win came against Jerseyville by one point, a team Mount Zion struggled against before a second-half surge. The Wildcats also scored more points (7) than the Braves against Taylorville. They also gave Mattoon, which beat the Braves, a run for its money, only losing 21-14. \n\"It's going to be a great game to see how we respond,\" Popovich said. \"I'm sure obviously we'll be favored, but we have to go out and have to do it on the field. \n\"The first offense Friday night, I want to see them face some adversity, and they're going to. They didn't get stopped the entire game (vs. Charleston). We had seven drives in the first half and we scored seven times. \n\"That's good. That's really good, but we need to see how they respond when we don't score and we come over and need to figure some things out.\" Ã—", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:03:26.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
