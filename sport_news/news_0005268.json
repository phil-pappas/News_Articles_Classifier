See, here’s the groom’s cake that New York Giants fan Liz Gigliotti surprised her new husband, a longtime New England Patriots fan, with this weekend. \nIn case you’re wondering, yes, that is Pats quarterback Tom Brady in a dress and high heels standing ever so gingerly atop a deflated football. Here’s an even better look. You can see Brady’s dress even has sequins. \nLuckily for Gigliotti, she seems to have married someone who can take a joke. And a big bite. \nDave was an awesome sport about his deflatecake! He even gave Tom Brady a… kiss? \nThat’s her good-sport groom Dave enjoying the fruits, er, sweets of her joke. \nAs they say, true love conquers all. Even DeflateGate. \n(H/t: NESN ) Marissa Payne writes for The Early Lead, a fast-breaking sports blog, where she focuses on what she calls the “cultural anthropological” side of sports, aka “mostly the fun stuff.” She is also an avid WWE fan. sports Success!
