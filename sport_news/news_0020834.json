No one was more thrilled than Steve Gleason, who did the same thing nine years ago. He tweeted: “Hey Falcons, #NEVER PUNT.”\nFalcons fan @BenTennant answered: “At least we don't need a machine to tweet.”\nIt was a painful barb to the former Saints player fighting ALS.\n“You don't kick someone when they’re down,” said Rodney Frisard, who is also battling the disease.\nFrisard and has a communication device like Gleason’s, and while he doesn't follow Twitter, he was disappointed at what he heard.\n“The guy that did it, he may have been a diehard Falcon fan who dislikes the Saints - which is fine - but taking on Steve is a little bit excessive,” Frisard said.\n“It's insulting to people like Rodney,” said Chrissie Trosclair. “They are just like you and I - one day they're living regular lives, and something happens.”\nTrosclair is with the ALS Association of Louisiana. She said at least 300 people in the state are diagnosed with the neuromuscular disease, which steals a person’s movement and voice. She said the tweet was heartless.\n“It's just football, and I know the Who Dat Nation may not agree with that, but it's just a game,” Trosclair said. “Leave the people affected with a horrible disease alone.”\n“This guy needs to go visit somebody with ALS,” Frisard said. “I'd love to have him. Maybe I'll convert him to be a Saints fan.”\nThe Who Dat Nation responded with venom.\nDavid Quote: : “Steve has more heart than you will ever have, man.”\nFalcons fan Price Blissit chimed in: “As a Falcons fan, I'm embarrassed to have you on our side, Ben. On behalf of true Falcons fans, I'm sorry Mr. Gleason.”\nWith the ultimate class and grace, Gleason tweeted: “Let’s leave @BenTennant alone and watch this game.\"\nThe ALS Association of Louisiana will have Defeat ALS walk in Audubon Park on Saturday (Oct. 17) beginning at 9 a.m. It's open to the public.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
