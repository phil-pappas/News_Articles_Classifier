Show Caption Previous Next \nAfter already defeating some of the best tennis players in the country this week, Tennessee freshman Sadie Hammond's run in the USTA/ITA Ohio Valley Regional Championships in West Lafayette, Ind., ended Sunday with a loss to the top-ranked player in the event. \nHammond, the No. 9 seed in the event, was defeated 6-1, 6-1 in the semifinals by Vanderbilt's Sydney Campbell, the No. 1 seed and the No. 7 player in the country. \nEarlier Sunday, Hammond defeated Kentucky's Akvile Parazinskaite 7-6 (4), 6-4 in the quarterfinals. \nHammond won four times in singles to advance her way through the 64-player tournament, and defeated two ranked opponents in the process. \nMen's Tennis: Tennessee junior Jack Schipanski and sophomore Igor Smelyanski were defeated in the semifinals of the USTA/ITA Ohio Valley Regional Championships at Goodfriend Tennis Center. \nPlaying in front of the home crowd, the UT duo lost 7-5, 1-6 (10-4) to Ball State's Andrew Stutz and Lucas Andersen. \nAfter squandering two set point chances in the first set up 5-4, Schipanski and Smelyanski dropped the final three games. \nThey came back strong in the second set but never led in the deciding 10-point tiebreaker. \nStill, it was an encouraging result for the duo, who had never been paired together in a tournament. It was the best doubles performance by the Vols in the regional tournament since Mikelis Libietis and John Collins won it in 2012. \nWhile the pairing is new, both players spent significant portions of last season paired with Andrew Dromsky, who was a senior last season. \nRowing: The Vols opened their fall season by sending one boat to the Head of the Charles Regatta in Boston. \nThe young Tennessee team of Kirsten Girard, Pari Baker, McDarragh Minnock, Badia Shehab and coxswain Hannah Malzahn finished ninth out of 19 in the women's championship 4+ division in 19 minutes, 3.296 seconds. \nMinnock, a redshirt senior, was the only non-freshman for the Vols. \nUSA Women won the race with a time of 17:33.793. Only five universities finished ahead of Tennessee in the event. Brown topped all schools with a time of 18:05.230. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
