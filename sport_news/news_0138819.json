He also said ‘what’ they are buying has changed dramatically. “We’re selling just as many Dalton jerseys as we are A.J. Green which was the fan favorite.”It should come as no surprise. Andy Dalton has played four games in a row with a quarterback rating of 115 or higher. The Bengals are 4-0 and ranked near the top in every category on offense. The team hits hard, bounces back from mistakes and has a swagger that comes across on a TV screen. They are fun to watch.Tia and Karla Van drove from Altoona, Iowa and Peoria, Illinois to watch Sunday’s Bengals-Chiefs game at Paul Brown stadium. Monday morning, Oct. 5, they loaded up sweaters, t-shirts and socks at the Bengals Pro-Shop. Tia has been a fan for years but made the trip this season because she likes what she sees.“There was a time when I just felt bad for them. They had no fans and I felt like being on the outside I needed to represent. Now we’re winning so I’m excited to see people understanding that. We just needed time; everybody just needs a little time.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:39:43.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
