Middletown (5-10-1), which lost to East 5-2 during the regular season, scored two goals in the final six minutes to close the gap. \n“I wanted to win so bad my last home game, so I just gave it everything on the field,” said Ventrola, who missed some early one-on-one opportunities before heating up. “I feel great. It was a little frustrating early on when their center back kept destroying me, but we eventually got around it and I’m just glad we came out on top.” \nEast (8-7-2) began finding holes in Middletown’s defense early, but couldn’t make anything of the opportunities. Instead, the Middies were able to break through on their first shot to open the scoring. Jake Flannery dribbled through a handful of defenders before sending the ball past East goalkeeper Conner Rehling in the 12th minute. \nThe Hawks continued to attack, utilizing their speed to bust the Middies’ trap defense for several breakaways to goal before Ventrola finally found himself with an open shot in front of the net. This time, he wasn’t going to miss — he tied the game at 1-1 with 20:40 left in the first half and began a five-goal run for the Hawks. \n“We didn’t let up putting balls forward and putting pressure on their defense,” East coach Jeremy Hilen said of the momentum swing. “We just finally got the timing down, maybe started out a little too lackadaisical and then woke up and got that sense of urgency back.” \nSeven minutes later, Ventrola had another opportunity, but Middies keeper Jose Jacinto came up with the save only to lose control, and Ilias Boujlil put away the rebound for a 2-1 lead that would hold until halftime. \nVentrola scored the next two goals within a three-minute span early in the second half, giving East a 4-1 lead with 27:58 remaining. Jack Harper sent in the Hawks’ final goal when his direct kick deflected off the wall of defenders and into the far-post netting with 7:52 left. \nMiddletown never quit, though, and Isaiah Rose answered on a rebound less than three minutes later before Ramon Bajeca scored his GMC-leading 23rd goal of the season off an assist from Andres Bajeca with nine ticks on the clock. \n“We took a 1-0 lead for the second time against them, and it just doesn’t hold up, but we kept fighting to the bitter end,” Middletown coach Andy Anderson said. “We gave up a couple in the second half that were just great plays for their kids. Great props to Jeremy. He’s got great kids at East and he’s a great coach, but we had our opportunities and just gave up too many.” \nEast, which made a surprising run to the regional finals last year, advances to play at Lebanon (11-2-3) at 7 p.m. Saturday. Middletown ended its season dropping seven of its last eight games.
