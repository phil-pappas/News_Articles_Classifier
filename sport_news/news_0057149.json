In short, offense is overrated. More >> \n(RNN) - For Tennessee and Alabama fans, this week is the Third Saturday in October, the name given to the rivalry game between the Volunteers and the Crimson Tide. \nNever mind that it’s actually the fourth Saturday in the month. \nThe bitter rivalry between Alabama and Tennessee has been dominated by the Crimson Tide as of late. The team in red have won eight games in a row. To make it worse, the Tide have won all but one of those games by double digits. \nSaturday’s game doesn’t look to be any different on the surface. A top-ranked Alabama hosts a struggling Tennessee team. Victory seems all but inevitable for the Tide. \nHowever, some still see Tennessee as a team with promise and a potential thorn in the side of Alabama’s playoff aspirations. The Volunteers are after all coming off a big win against Georgia. \nFor Texas A&M and Ole Miss fans, it’s just the regular fourth Saturday in October. But that doesn’t make the two team’s showdown any less special. \nBoth teams - which had high hopes this season - are reeling from big losses. \nOle Miss suffered a shellacking from an upstart Memphis team, while Texas A&M was handily defeated by Alabama. \nWhen the Rebels and Aggies face off on Saturday, the winner will take home a sense of relief, and the loser will slip further into doldrums. \nTennessee vs Alabama \nPlayer to look out for: QB Joshua Dobbs \nIf there’s any proven recipe to beating the Crimson Tide, it’s a dual-threat quarterback. Joshua Dobbs definitely qualifies as that. \nFortunately for the Vols, the Dobbs last performance against Georgia saw him throw for 312 yards and three touchdowns, as well as rush for 118 yards and two more scores. \nIt’s doubtful Dobbs replicates his five-score showing against Alabama’s stalwart defense, but it’s not unlikely he’s able to find success outside of the pocket. \nThe explosive quarterback actually made his debut last season against the Tide. He entered the game during Tennessee’s third offensive series, giving his team a spirited spark that prevented a massive blowout. \nThis year Dobbs is the decided starter for Tennessee. Now, as a more refined player, he is tasked with giving the Volunteers’ season something to be proud of. \nIt’s not going to be an easy task, but he is certainly the type of player that has given Nick Saban-led defenses fits in the past. \nTexas A&M vs Ole Miss \nPlayer to look out for: QB Kyle Allen \nKyle Allen threw more touchdowns to Alabama players than his own team last week. Ouch. \nHis three interceptions against the Crimson Tide amount to 60 percent of his season total: 5. With all that said, Allen has had a pretty great season prior to the Alabama game. As a matter of fact, he was a Heisman hopeful. \nIt’s fair to say that the Heisman Trophy is a long shot for the sophomore quarterback, but his season is far from irredeemable. It cannot be forgotten that, prior to the Alabama game, the quarterback was on fire with 12 passing touchdowns,1,274 yards through the air, and an undefeated record. \nWhen the Aggies visit Oxford, MS, Allen will face a foe that’s reeling more than himself. The Rebels have dropped two of their last three, including an unexpected loss to Memphis. \nAllen’s ability to shake off last week’s horrendous effort is key to his team’s capability to differentiate themselves from another capsizing SEC team. \n  reserved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:25:22.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
