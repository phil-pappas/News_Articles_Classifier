Only once have bonus points decided the outcome of a pool — in 2011 when France edged out Tonga and went on to reach the final — but should England beat Australia today it could come down to such slender margins again. \nThat is why Gatland, despite being a proud New Zealander, will be urging on Australia at Twickenham today when victory for the Wallabies will spare Wales a nerve-jangling all-or-nothing clash the following week. \n“To be honest, (Australia) would do us a big favor wouldn’t they?” Gatland, whose side beat England in such gutsy fashion last week. \n“It means we make the quarter-finals so it’s hard not to. If we’re being entirely selfish about our own destiny, Australia can do us a big favor on Saturday. \n“It’s a bit hard for a Kiwi to be jumping up and cheering for Aussies as well. I’ll be quite neutral this weekend.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:01:05.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
