Some spent up to five hours getting ready.\nAfter their painstaking preparation, contestants wearing 1950s-style cat eye makeup, pink lips and blonde pin curls performed song and dance numbers and strutted their stuff in sequined dresses created by some of Venezuela's top designers.\nIn this Oct. 18, 2015 photo, contestants dance during the ninth annual Miss Gay Venezuela beauty pageant in Caracas, Venezuela. There are two ways to get into the contest: by paying an inscription fee and financing oneself, or getting picked in a casting by the Miss Gay Venezuela organization which then pays the contestant's bills. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos) (Ariana Cubillos/AP) Beauty pageants have reached the level of national sport in Venezuela, which claims to have produced more international contest winners than any other country. Young women from poor neighborhoods pay huge sums to attend beauty schools with hopes of making it to the international pageant circuit. Young men compete in events that reward handsome faces and chiseled muscles.\nThe Miss Gay contest is less conventional, but still cleaves to some beauty contest norms, including evening wear and swimsuit competitions. All contestants have to be younger than 37 and stand at least 1.7 meters (5'6\") tall.", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1021/20151021__LTVenezuelaMissGayPhotoGallery~p2_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:04:41.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
