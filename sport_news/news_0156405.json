CET Sergio Aguero Show Sees Man City Past Newcastle, Sunderland Draw Source: Espnfc.com \nSergio Aguero scored five goals as Manchester City came from behind to thrash Newcastle 6-1 at the Etihad Stadium. \nCity end the day back on top of the Premier League after a resounding victory in which Aguero scored five in 20 minutes during a remarkable spell that also saw Kevin De Bruyne net for the hosts. \nNewcastle, who drew 2-2 with Chelsea last weekend after having had a two-goal lead, went ahead in the 18th minute when Aleksandar Mitrovic stooped to head home a Georginio Wijnaldum cross for his first goal since his summer move from Anderlecht. \nHe saw a second goal ruled out for offside on 25 minutes, but City were level just before the break when Aguero beat Tim Krul with a diving header from Fernandinho’s headed assist. \nThat sparked a goal glut that saw Aguero complete his hat trick by the 50th minute, with De Bruyne producing an acrobatic finish for his side’s fourth. \nAguero added two further goals in the 60th and 62nd minutes to match the Premier League record for goals in a single match before being substituted by manager Manuel Pellegrini four minutes later. \nSunderland threw away a two-goal lead as they were held to a 2-2 draw by West Ham United at the Stadium of Light. \nSunderland, who had taken just two points from their opening seven games this season, went into the game on the back of strong speculation that coach Dick Advocaat had decided to walk away regardless of the result. \nHowever, Advocaat was given cause to reconsider as Steven Fletcher fired home following a Yann M’Vila corner on 10 minutes before Jeremain Lens chipped home a second on 22 minutes. \nFabio Borini missed a glorious chance to make it 3-0 on 38 minutes, and his failure to hit the target was punished just before the break when Carl Jenkinson pulled one back for the Hammers. \nSunderland then saw Lens sent off when he picked up a second booking on 57 minutes, and West Ham were level on the hour as Dimitri Payet fired home. \nEngland international Jamie Vardy gave the Foxes the lead when he won and converted a penalty for his sixth goal in eight Premier League appearances. \nLeicester doubled their advantage shortly after the restart when Jeffrey Schlupp scored on the counter-attack, but Dieumerci Mbokani gave the hosts hope when he flicked home a Jonny Howson cross on 68 minutes. \nHowever, Leicester held on for a victory that leaves them fourth in the table. \nAston Villa ‘s poor start to the season continued as they were beaten 1-0 at home by Stoke City . \nStoke scored the only goal of the game on 55 minutes when Glen Johnson picked out Marko Arnautovic, who fired a low shot past Brad Guzan. \nBournemouth were denied victory by a late penalty save as they drew 1-1 at home to Watford . \nGlenn Murray gave the Cherries the lead on his full debut for the club, heading past Heurelho Gomes on 28 minutes, but Watford were gifted an equaliser just before half-time when keeper Artur Boruc gave the ball away to Odion Ighalo for a simple finish. \nMurray had the chance to win it from the penalty spot late on, but Gomes made the save to give the Hornets a share of the spoils. \nCrystal Palace continued their impressive start to the season with a 2-0 home win over West Bromwich Albion in Saturday’s early game. \nYannick Bolasie made the breakthrough when he headed home Yohan Cabaye’s superb cross from the left after 67 minutes, and Palace doubled their advantage when Wilfried Zaha won a late penalty, which Cabaye converted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T15:06:09.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
