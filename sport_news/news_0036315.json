Zidane, who is now the boss of the club's B side, Real Madrid Castilla, believes that the former Manchester United attacker benefits from having Messi around. \"Fifty to 55 goals per season is just not human,\" Zidane told French TV programme Canal Football Club. \n\"But you should see him at training. At training, he's a guy who every ball, every match, every corner... he wants to score, he wants to win. \n\"And when he scores he does the same thing he does in a match. He's happy and he falls to his knees [to celebrate]... it's incredible. \n\"There's a feature in all of that and it's that there's another player opposite who pushes him. That's to say the rivalry he has with Messi. \n\"He doesn't need that [to perform]. But what keeps him scoring 55 to 60 goals a season is the fact that he says to himself 'this year I have to score one more than the other guy every time.'\" \nFormer Real manager Carlo Ancelotti said last week that he does not think Ronaldo will leave Madrid for Paris Saint-Germain, as reports periodically suggest, next year. \nZidane, himself a former European and World Player of the Year, agrees. \"He's the best player in the world so it's normal that you'd want to sign Ronaldo,\" the 1998 World Cup winner said. \n\"But he's comfortable at Real... since Raul left he's really become the other legend of the club.\" \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
