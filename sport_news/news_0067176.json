(AP) - The company that has been running Vicksburg's DiamondJacks casino since it came out bankruptcy in 2013 will buy it.\nGulfport-based Foundation Gaming Group said Monday that it would buy what was Vicksburg's first casino, having opened in 1993 as Isle of Capri. Legends Gaming bought it in 2006, subsequently declaring bankruptcy twice.\nFoundation's Les McMackin says the company will borrow to finance the purchase. No price was disclosed. Mississippi's Gaming Commission is scheduled to vote on approving the sale Thursday.\nMcMackin says the Vicksburg gambling hall, with more than 300 employees, will keep operating as DiamondJacks. He says Foundation is considering long-term plans.\nFoundation says it will continue to run DiamondJacks in Bossier City, Louisiana, under contract with the current owners, who were creditors of Legends.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
