Not only did they have the opportunity to bask in the glory of their side's record 1,000th Bundesliga victory, but they were rewarded for following a brilliant team with a free beer amid the wild celebrations. \nThe 4-0 thrashing of Cologne simply paved the way for the glorious celebrations which followed, with the club's greatest heroes and memories recalled on social media, and current players afforded the luxury of rounding off the feat while also stretching their lead at the top of the table to a ridiculous 10 points. \nOh, and Arjen Robben marked his belated return from injury with a goal after a sublime backheel from Robert Lewandowski.

Right now there seems to be nothing and no-one capable of stopping him. Sports News Follow Us Have we now come to a point where you think your own eyes can see your ears?
