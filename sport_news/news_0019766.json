We hope to have him for the weekend.”\nDeKeyser strained ligaments when he bumped into the boards during an exhibition game Sept. 30 in Pittsburgh.\n“I’ve been doing some treatments and rehab and it’s been feeling good,” DeKeyser said. “I’ve been skating a bit and it’s been feeling better every day.\n“I was off the ice for nine or 10 days and that kind of hurts you a bit, but the only way to get back in game shape is to play games.”\nBlashill also is thinking Darren Helm (concussion) will be ready in Montreal.\nIce chips \nJohan Franzen (ill) didn’t practice Wednesday after not playing the night before. The Red Wings aren’t certain yet whether this is related to Franzen’s previous concussion issues.\n… Henrik Zetterberg and Mike Green didn’t practice but Blashill said it was strictly a “maintenance day” and said the two are available to play.\n… Blashill will name a starting goatlender for Friday’s game against Carolina that morning.\n… Abdelakder said he learned quite a bit from Tomas Holmstrom about being net-front play, and is getting increasingly comfortable.\n“It’s knowing the area, and you have to stay out of the crease these days especially with replay,” Abdelkader said. “You have to be aware of where you are on the ice. Just watching him, you learn quite a bit as far as how to back into goalies and not get caught, I guess. It’s harder and harder with replay and goalie interference.”\nted.kulfan@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tkulfan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:17:12.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
