The Tide's lead was down to eight after a 3-yard touchdown pass from Kyle Allen to Ricky Seals-Jones early in the third quarter. A blocked punt following an Alabama three-and-out then gave the Aggies the ball at the Tide's 29-yard line with a chance at a tying touchdown.\nTexas A&M players had a noticeable bounce while the crowd inside Kyle Field was as loud as it had been the entire game.\nFrom there, Alabama held on and pulled away for a 41-23 win.\nTexas A&M failed to gain a yard on the drive that could have produced a tying touchdown. The Tide got a field goal from Adam Griffith on the ensuing possession. Another Griffith field goal had Alabama back up by 14 early in the fourth quarter.\nFreshman cornerback Minkah Fitzpatrick essentially sealed the win midway through the fourth quarter with an interception he returned 55 yards for a touchdown to push the Tide's lead to 41-23.\nGame-changer at safety\nTide safety Eddie Jackson had two momentum-shifting plays.\nWith Texas A&M driving midway through the second quarter and down just 21-6, Jackson intercepted Allen and returned the ball 93 yards for a touchdown.\nHe had another interception late in the third quarter with the Tide up 31-20.\nThe interception and 26-yard return set Alabama up at Texas A&M's 28-yard line.\nThat put the Tide in position for the Griffith field goal that extended their lead to 34-20.\nAfter moving from cornerback to safety during the spring, Jackson has five interceptions, two interception returns for touchdowns and a forced fumble that he recovered in his first seven games at safety.\nBig-play freshman\nFitzpatrick had two pick-sixes.\nHe was responsible for the game's first points, intercepting Allen midway through the first quarter and returning the ball 33 yards for a touchdown.\nHe then had the second pick-six during the fourth quarter.\nLeading the way\nWhile Alabama running back Derrick Henry was limited to a degree after the Tide's first drive of the second quarter, Henry was a big part of Alabama jumping out to an early 21-6 lead.\nHenry's previous career-high for rushing yards in a game was 148. He ran for 153 yards and a touchdown on nine carries during the first quarter Saturday.\nHe added a 6-yard touchdown on his first carry of the second quarter.\nHenry finished with 236 yards and the two touchdowns on 32 carries.\nHe also had an 18-yard catch-and-run.\nBad day for special teams\nKirk had the punt return for a touchdown.\nThe Aggies blocked a punt.\nIn addition, usually reliable Tide punt returner Cyrus Jones had a fumble that was recovered by Texas A&M.\nOne of the positives for Alabama special teams-wise? Griffith, who has struggled but was 2 of 2 on field goals Saturday.\nUneven game for the secondary\nWhile Alabama had the four interceptions and three pick-sixes, Texas A&M's quarterbacks — Allen and Kyler Murray — threw for a combined 284 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:55:04.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
