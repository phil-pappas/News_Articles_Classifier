The Mount Vernon wide receiver hauled in four catches on Friday--including the game winning score--as the Mountaineers beat Cassville 23-16 on Homecoming night at Mountaineer Stadium.\"Every time, I look for Jarrett on the field,\" said Mountaineer quarterback Garrett Hadlock, who threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns in the win. \"We have this connection. We've played football together since we were in flag football. He's my No. 1 go-to guy. He's a great receiver.\" Locked in a tie game with three minutes remaining, Hadlock threw a jump ball down the middle of the field and Massie--who was sandwiched between two defenders--out jumped his competition and hauled in the 40-yard reception. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS \"I didn't know how I was going to catch that, splitting two guys,\" said Massie, listed at 6-foot-1. \"I just caught it with my facemask and one hand, pretty much.\" Three plays later, Hadlock found Massie on a fade route in the endzone, with Massie reaching his hands over the defender to haul in the 23-yard, game-winning reception.\"Garrett Hadlock to Jarrett Massie is unbelievable,\" Mount Vernon coach Tom Cox said. Moments prior to the game-winning drive, it looked like Mount Vernon was going to give the game away. Mountaineers' tailback Payton Oehlschlager had busted a 10-yard run, giving Mount Vernon a first down inside the Cassville 25 yard-line, or so they thought. The officials ruled that Oehlschlager fumbled the football at the end of the play and Cassville had recovered. The call didn't go over well with Mount Vernon coaches or players. The Mountaineers were called for three unsportsmanlike penalties, resulting in 45 free yards for Cassville and a potential game-winning drive that would begin at Mount Vernon's 39 yard-line.\"We lost our composure, myself included,\" Cox said. \"I called timeout and told our guys, that's it, myself included. Let's just regain our composure and let's play football. That's what they did.\" Mount Vernon's defense stiffened. Even with the great field position, Cassville was forced to settle for a field goal. The 35-yard attempt banged against the right upright, ending the drive, and setting the stage for the Hadlock-to-Massie game-winning connection.\"A win like this for us ... I can't even describe what it means, where we've come from in the past few years,\" Cox said. \"To beat a program like Cassville, their record was not great, but they are a physical football team and our defense had been struggling. Coach (Joy) Maberry has worked so hard with our guys. I'm just really, really proud, especially of our defense.\" Cassville 7 2 7 0 16 Mount Vernon 6 10 0 7 23 1Q, 4:32--Cassville--River Phelps 6-yard TD run (Phelps PAT) 1Q, 3:35--Mt.
