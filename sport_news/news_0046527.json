(AP Photo/Alan Diaz) \nDAVIE, Fla. (AP) — Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle has been fired by new interim coach Dan Campbell. \nDefensive backs coach Lou Anarumo was promoted Thursday to replace Coyle. The moves came after the Dolphins fired head coach Joe Philbin on Monday and promoted tight ends coach Campbell. \nCoyle was widely criticized for the decline of the defense since he joined the Dolphins in 2012. They gave up 317 points that season, followed by 335 and 373, and after four games they’re on pace to allow 404 this season. \nMiami (1-3) ranks last in the NFL in rushing defense at 160.5 yards per game, and last with one sack. \nAnarumo has been with the Dolphins since 2012. Before that he was defensive backs coach at Purdue from 2004 to 2011. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:42:28.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
