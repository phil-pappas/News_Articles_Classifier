But their advanced degree on tendencies came in their must-watch training camp practices battles all last summer and then during the season when Bill Belichick allowed the first-team offense to run drills against the first-team defense. \nIt was football at its finest. Brady is the best quarterback in NFL history. Revis is the best cover corner since Deion Sanders and one of the top five corners of all time. They will each be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \nThey already admired each other’s game as opponents and developed a nice friendship when they were teammates. \nOn the practice field, Brady went right at Revis and Revis didn’t back down. They each won their share. It was as good as it gets. Pride was on the line. Even the Patriots enjoyed watching Revis go against Brady. \n“For sure,” Danny Amendola said. “Ultimate competitor.” \nBrady vs. Revis didn’t count last year. It was only practice. But the best individual matchup in the NFL resumes Sunday when Revis shows up at Gillette Stadium as the enemy again in a first-place showdown against the undefeated Patriots. Brady and Julian Edelman and Amendola know all about Revis, but Revis knows all about them, too. \nBrady blocked out the noise during Deflategate and shrugged off a couple of things Revis said in May about the Patriots and their history of cheating and Brady being there for it in the past. He likes Revis and didn’t care about his Deflategate comments. He certainly heard much worse. \n“There was a lot of competition in practice last year with him,” Brady said. “He makes it tough. His instincts are incredible out there. He’s one of those guys that sees everything on the field. He’s a very dependable, consistent player. He’s been an incredible playmaker since he’s been in the league. It was great to have him here, but he moved on and now he’s our competition again.” \nAfter the Bucs cut Revis following the 2013 season after he was traded from the Jets, he signed a two-year $32 million deal with New England but only after the Jets rejected Revis’ advances to return. Revis made $12 million last season and helped Brady and Belichick end a 10-year drought without a Super Bowl ring. \nThe second year of Revis’ deal was thrown in simply so New England could pro-rate Revis $10 million signing bonus over two years. It was pre-arranged that the Patriots would not pick up the $12 million option that would have led to total compensation of $20 million this season with a $25 million cap number. Frank Franklin II/AP But now Darrelle Revis (l.) is back with the Jets and looking to steal a few passes from Brady. \nPatriots owner Robert Kraft wanted Revis to return, but he left the negotiations up to Belichick, who rarely strays from his budget. Even though he’s got the greatest bargain in sports with Brady working on a three-year $27 million deal, and even though Kraft said the Patriots made a “very competitive offer,” Belichick threw in the towel on Revis. The Jets made sure it was an easy decision for Revis by giving him a five-year $70 million contract that includes $39 million in guaranteed money. Revis loves New York and that was something the Patriots could not match. \nRevis allowed Belichick to change his defensive approach. He often put him on the best receiver, who then made him disappear. That gave Belichick flexibility with the rest of the defense. \nThere is no resentment in the Patriots locker room that Revis was one-and-done. They are football players, but they are businessmen. Revis helped them win a ring. Now he’s gone. They move on. \n“That’s kind of NFL football and free agency and stuff like that,” Brady said. “A lot of players have switched teams over the years. We’ve had a lot of guys come to our team from that team and vice versa.” \nRevis joined the parade of coaches and players who have been with the Patriots and Jets in the last 18 years. It started when Bill Parcells didn’t want to work for Kraft anymore and worked his way out of New England and became the Jets GM-coach in 1997. Kraft despised Parcells back then – they now have a civil relationship – and even though he wanted to promote Belichick, who had spent the ’97 season as a Patriots assistant, Kraft felt he needed to make a clean break from Parcells. Belichick joined Parcells with the Jets and Kraft hired former Jets coach Pete Carroll. \nCurtis Martin went from the Pats to the Jets in 1998. Belichick went from the Jets back to the Patriots in 2000. He brought personnel director Scott Pioli with him. Vinny Testaverde went from the Jets to the Patriots in 2006. Eric Mangini, a Belichick assistant, was hired as the Jets head coach in 2006. \nFrom the time Parcells joined the Jets through Revis’ return, more than 60 players have played for both the Patriots and Jets. Martin and Revis are the best of the bunch. \nEven though Parcells selected Chad Pennington in the first round in 2000, Jets highly respected scout Jesse Kaye pleaded with him to draft Brady before he eventually went to New England in the sixth round. Parcells disagreed. \nMaybe Brady can one day hop aboard the New England-New York shuttle and finish his career with the Jets. By then, Revis may be back in New England.
