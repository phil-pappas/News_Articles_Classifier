By STEPHEN HAWKINS (0) Comments \nArlington, Texas — Sure, R.A. Dickey was disappointed when he saw Blue Jays manager John Gibbons walking toward the mound. \nThe 40-year-old knuckleballer had a six-run lead and was one out shy of qualifying for a win in his first postseason start. \nDickey also knew he was handing the ball off to a fellow Cy Young winner, and Toronto went on to beat the Texas Rangers, 8-4, on Monday to force a deciding Game 5 at home in the AL Division Series. \n\"When you look over your shoulder and you've got a guy like this coming in behind you, it makes it a whole lot easier to give the ball to Gibby,\" Dickey said, with David Price seated to his right after the game. \"It's amazing what you can accomplish when you don't care who gets the credit. We're going back to Toronto with a chance.\" \nToronto led, 3-0, even before Dickey threw his first pitch, with Josh Donaldson and Chris Colabello homering in the first inning. \n\"That's great. If you could script it, obviously, that's what you'd want,\" said Donaldson, who has reached safely in five of his last nine appearances, including two homers in the series. \nThe Blue Jays made it three homers in the first eight batters against Derek Holland when Kevin Pillar connected in the second for a 4-0 lead. Pillar's drive was caught by Price, who was playing catch in the bullpen with Marcus Stroman. \nGame 5 is Wednesday. Cole Hamels starts for the Rangers against Stroman in a rematch from Game 2, which Texas won in 14 innings. \nAfter losing the first two games in the series at home, the Blue Jays won both games in Texas in a span of 24 hours. \n\"Our mindset the whole time has been you've got to win three games, however you do it, when you do it,\" said Pillar, who also had a pair of RBI singles. \"But it's definitely nice knowing flying home we've got another game.\" \nDickey, the 2012 NL Cy Young winner when he won 20 games for the New York Mets, allowed one run over 4 2-3 innings and was pulled with a 7-1 lead, with a runner on base. Shin-Soo Choo, already with two hits, was coming to the plate. \n\"It was hard for me to do, but I thought that was the best way to win the game, keep them from coming back,\" Gibbons said. \"Probably not a relationship-building move, but a team win, that's what I was looking for.\" \nPrice needed only one pitch to retire Choo to end the fifth, and went three innings to get the win after losing in the series opener. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
