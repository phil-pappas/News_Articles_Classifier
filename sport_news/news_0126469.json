The Rockets demolished Eastern Michigan last week, 63-20, and also boast wins over No. 18 Arkansas and Iowa State. \nThey beat Kent State, which gave UMass so much trouble over the weekend, by a convincing 38-7 margin. \nThe Minutemen lost on the road to Toledo last year, 42-35, electing to let the Rockets score the go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter in hopes of getting the ball back with enough time left on the clock to force overtime. \nSaturday's game kicks off at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough at 3 p.m. and will be broadcast online via ESPN3/WatchESPN. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:37:02.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
