I let him deal with it. … There’s too many.” Melton back on gridiron after mourning grandfather \nSeymore has received interest from Rutgers, Virginia Tech and West Virginia this season, just to name a few. He keeps all the correspondence in a giant Rutgers envelope on his kitchen table. \n“It’s exciting,” he said. “I always wanted to have the opportunities like I’m getting right now.” \nSeymore, who had rushed for 585 yards and scored seven touchdowns this season going into Friday's game, will be on Rutgers' campus for the second time this year on Saturday night when the Scarlet Knights host No. 1 Ohio State. He was also invited to New Brunswick when Rutgers hosted Kansas in late September. \n“It’s pretty fun,” Seymore said of his first excursion up north. “I go up there, I get to meet the coaches, I get to eat with them before the games, and then I get to go out there on the field and watch the players warm up, and I have real close seats, so I can watch the game and I get to talk to a whole bunch of students from there.” Vineland's Gonzalez moved back to city for football \nSeymore admits he’s thought about playing in front of those same fans he sat and watched the game with. \n“I watch a lot of NFL highlights, college highlights, and I could see myself doing stuff like that in college,” he said. \nSo can his coach, Dan Russo. \n“Daivon is a special talent,” he said. “There’s not many 6-foot, 220-pound running backs that can do what he can, 4.4 (40-yard dash), bench press 330. He’s just a phenomenal athlete. We can’t wait to see him play somewhere in a couple years. Luckily, we still have another year with him.” \nAnd Seymore understands that, which is why he’s keeping the same attitude he had his first two seasons at Vineland. Vineland football: Reyes, Bokma impressing as freshmen \n“I try not to let it get to my head all the time,” he said. “I just try and take it one day at a time, worry about football, worry about school, got to get my grades up higher and higher. My grades are pretty good right now, but every day I just take it one day a time.” \nHe gets plenty of help from Russo, who continues to stress his school work, and Moseley, who keeps him plenty busy at home. \n“I’m the proud grandmom, and I’m just like, yeah, you’re a football hero, but you still have to take out the trash, clean your room, rake the leaves,” she said. “You still have things you have to do. Life goes on.” Football: Zigler defined by toughness \nBut Moseley does get excited. She constantly talks about Seymore when she’s at work at the New Jersey Veterans Memorial home, and her Facebook profile picture is his invitation to the Rutgers-Ohio State game. \n“I tell him it’s an honor,” she said, “but at the same time I explain to him that he’s one of the exceptions. Another exception is coming up, up and coming. You’re good, but there’s always going to be somebody that’s going to be better or fight just as hard to get where you are.” \nSeymore has taken those words to heart, Russo said. Vineland's Cephas returns to field \n“He’s a coach’s dream,” Russo said. “Great attitude, great work ethic and like I said, very humble, and that’s what we’re looking to do here. I tell the kids if you’re that good, other people talk about you, never talk about yourself. If you’re that good, people know.” \nSeymore’s ever-filling mailbox is proof of that. \nJosh Friedman; (856) 563-5257; jfriedman2@gannettnj.com 57 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vineland.dj/1S1vW0A TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:58:51.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
