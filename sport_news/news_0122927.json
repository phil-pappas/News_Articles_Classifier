(Bernard Thomas / The Herald-Sun / Associated Press) David Wharton Contact Reporter \nTo no great surprise, Mike Krzyzewski said he will step down as coach of the U.S. men's basketball team after the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. \nOf course, the legendary Duke coach talked about leaving after the 2012 London Games, but this time he appears to mean it. \n\"I think it's time to move ahead,\" Krzyzewski told ESPN.com , adding: \"There has to be a succession ... a planned succession with really good people so we can keep the continuity of the program going.'' \nHis successor will have big shoes to fill, following a man who has amassed a 75-1 record in international competition since 2006. \nKrzyzewski led the Americans to Olympic gold in London and at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He also has a 2010 world championship on his resume. \n\"Hopefully we can finish things up well with Rio and I would move on to something else with USA Basketball,'' he said. \"But I think we're ready as an organization to do that, and I'm excited about the future because [of] what we've done over the last 10 years.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:44:54.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
