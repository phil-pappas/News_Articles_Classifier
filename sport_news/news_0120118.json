However, he has not been cleared to begin on the field.\" \nCruz apparently will not make a storybook return against the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field, a year after he suffered a torn right patellar tendon . \nPLUS : Odell Beckham Jr. optimistic he will play vs. Eagles, source says \nCruz was expected to make his season debut against the Bills on Oct. 4 in Buffalo - he told reporters the Monday before the game he was \"convinced\" he would be able to play - but on his first day back at practice, he reinjured the calf and left the field after just a handful of reps. He has not run on ground since. Cruz initially injured the calf on Aug. 17. \nCruz has not played in a game since he suffered his season-ending injury against the Eagles. \nAfter he reinjured the calf, Cruz had a PRP injection in the muscle to try to speed up the recovery process. Cruz was scheduled to meet with doctors this past Monday , 10 days after the injection, to re-evaluate the injury. \nThe Giants have been off Tuesday and Wednesday, and Coughlin had no update on the examination when asked Monday by New York-area reporters on a conference call. \nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.
