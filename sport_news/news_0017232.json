On Saturday, Burris faces Class A No.1 Mishawaka Marian with a chance to take the first boys soccer semistate title in Delaware County history. \nBurris struggled to find an identity and play consistent soccer throughout the first half of the season and went through an abrupt coaching change after a loss to Central. Behind new coach Harald Leusmann, who lost his voice after the regional win and had to write his thoughts on paper for 24 hours, the team rallied and is poised to make state. \nIt feels cliché, fairy tale, like something out of a book. \n\"The win from regionals doesn't even feel real yet, I keep thinking about it but it hasn't set in yet that it's come this far,\" Tellez said. \"Me, myself, some of the other boys on this team have never won a high school title, so to get this far, it means so much.\" \nMuch of Burris' success can be attributed to the defense. Through the last three postseason wins against Wapahani, Crawfordsville and Heritage Christian, Burris hasn't allowed a goal despite what Leusmann described as an offensive onslaught by Heritage Christian in the second half. \nRicardo Tellez blocks a kick at Heath Fields on Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015.

A senior Indiana Academy student, Tellez encourages the team and provides the energy Burris feeds off. \n\"In sports you have to get fired up, you have your hype guy, a middle linebacker or a quarterback, it's uncommon for the leading goal scorer to not be that guy,\" Bock said. \"But Ricky is the voice, the heart and the soul, he's the guy who motivates everyone before a game and keeps them straight in practice.\" \nAgainst Heritage Christian, Tellez faced a penalty kick halfway through the first half. The kick ultimately sailed high above the crossbar, but at the time, the score was tied at zero and a goal could be a spirit breaker. \nWith the weight of the season on his back, Tellez said instead of concentrating during penalty kicks, he tries to let everything out of his mind. He reminds himself that he feels lucky to be in that situation, because last season, he played in just one game for just a few minutes. \nWith every shot that comes through the box, he's not just trying to prolong Burris' season. He's trying to wring out every last bit of his own career with the Owls. He made 12 saves in the shutout against Heritage Christian. Leusmann said Tellez is his right-hand man and keeps order on the team, also helping inspire them before every match. \nThe effort and skill level of Tellez and the Burris defense hasn't gone unnoticed. Assistant coach Nouh Almusallam spent most of his life playing soccer in Saudi Arabia, and said he's blown away by how good the team has been. \n\"The fighting spirit, we may have had some stumbles in the last three games, but the fighting spirit was the key to the wins,\" Almusallam said. \nTellez said the best defenders on the team are Kevin Beatty and Josh Monroe and have the versatility to attack on offense, but there are several other players who didn't see the field last season and are now making contributions. \nWith everyone focused on Saturday, there's still a little time for players to appreciate that they're still playing soccer in late October, when almost all high school teams have shut down. \n\"This is an absolute dream,\" Tellez said. \"It's a dream, and we're ready to turn the page and keep making history.\" \nTurn the page on a fairy tale? Nobody knows until Saturday if there's another page left, or if it's the back of the book cover. \nBurris prepares for Semistate at Heath Fields Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015.
