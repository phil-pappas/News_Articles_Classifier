EDITORIAL: Don’t block ‘redshirt’ athletes \n“It’s hard to believe we have to go through the exercise of doing this legislatively.” \nBurzichelli told MyCentralJersey.com he believed the companion bills would limit student-athletes in good academic standing who repeat a middle school year (grades six, seven or eight) to three years or six consecutive semesters of high school athletic eligibility at all levels (freshman, jayvee and varsity). \nUnder the proposed legislation, schools that do not comply could lose their membership to the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletics Association or be deemed ineligible to compete in the postseason, Burzichelli said. \nNJSIAA Executive Director Steve Timko said the statewide athletics association joins \"the bill’s sponsors in their unease about those who manipulate the system for athletic advantage, and welcome all points of view as we continue to address this complex issue.\" \nTimko said the NJSIAA has \"been in touch with Senator Codey and have shared with him our input regarding the issue and thoughts about the bill.” \nNo data is currently available regarding student-athletes that redshirt prior to high school, but Burzichelli said he believes the numbers are increasing. \nFormer St. Joseph basketball star Karl-Anthony Towns, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2015 NBA Draft who repeated eighth grade before entering high school, is perhaps the most recognizable example of redshirting. Towns graduated from St. Joseph in three years near the top of his class before attending the University of Kentucky. \nBrian Dohn, a national recruiting analyst for Scout.com, said he doesn’t think redshirting for high school is “some huge glaring issue.” \n“I think more kids are doing it, but I don’t think enough are doing it to make it a trend. If people think it’s important, they will do what they feel is in the best interest of their child.\" \nDohn said he believed enforcing the legislation, should it become law, will be difficult because “How do you differentiate between academic and athletic advantage? What if the parents decided instead of being a ‘C’ student, if we held him back he could be an ‘A’ student?” \nIn addition, Dohn said, he believed the pending legislation will not prevent a parent from holding their child back for a school year before sixth grade or even enrolling their child a year later for kindergarten so that the child will have a chance to physically mature. \nOther examples of former star New Jersey high school athletes who have redshirted, according to the research of NJ Advance Media.com’s Matt Stanmyre, include current college freshmen basketball players Malachi Richardson (Trenton Catholic and Roselle Catholic) and Isaiah Briscoe (St. Benedict’s Prep and Roselle Catholic) as well as three-time NJSIAA Wrestling Tournament champion Johnny Sebastian of Bergen Catholic and former Boston College linebacker Brian Toal of Don Bosco Prep. \n“How many of these kids that stayed back to get bigger, stronger, faster have actually gone on to the next level,” St. Joseph High School Athletics Director Jerry Smith said. “I think the politicians should do some research before they introduce the bill to see how many actually benefit from (redshirting).” \nAccording to NJSIAA rules, students are ineligible to compete in high school if they turn 19 after Sept. 1 of their senior year. The statewide association can grant a waiver for hardship. Don't miss a thing \nDownload our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
