It was just a blessing to be back out here and just to be back out here with them.'' \nStill, there is a question of how Carroo — who was selected as one of four captains based on a team-wide vote in August — will go about leading after a pair of incidents led to team-imposed disciplinary measures. \nPLUS: Rutgers receiver Leonte Carroo says he's 'blessed' to be back after 'unfortunate event' \n\"The biggest thing for me is to make sure my teammates know what type of guy I am,'' Carroo said, when asked how he plans to go about leading the team going forward. \"They already know, but that doesn't mean I wasn't in there ear every day I was out. I was watching practice, I was texting the receivers, coaching them up, I was motivating guys before the game, calls at night while they were in the hotel, talking to them nonstop. \n\"So even though I wasn't here physically they still heard me every single day.'' \nIn the last week of training camp, Carroo was among five players suspended for the first half of the season opener against Norfolk State as a result of a curfew violation. Carroo called it a \"dumb decision,'' took ownership of the penalty by saying he got \"exactly what (he) deserved,'' and said he would take \"full responsibility ... being a captain and a leader of this team'' to \"go out there and do my best to make sure this team is still disciplined.'' \nA day after the Scarlet Knights' Week 2 loss to Washington State, Carroo was suspended by head coach Kyle Flood as a result of an altercation outside the football team's headquarters. Carroo was arrested by the Rutgers University Police Department and charged with simple assault under domestic violence for allegedly slamming a woman to the ground outside of the Hale Center. \nThe charge and a restraining order against Carroo were dismissed in separate court hearings on Tuesday when the alleged victim said she did not wish to pursue the case . \nFlood — who is currently serving his own suspension stemming from a violation of a university compliance policy — reinstated Carroo on Wednesday after, according to a Rutgers athletics statement, \"he accepted the responsibility that comes with his return to the team.'' \nALSO: What will receiver Leonte Carroo's role be vs. Michigan State? \nCarroo declined to address what those stipulations are, but said following practice Thursday that he's \"just happy to be back out here with my teammates and ready to go.'' \nThe program's all-time leader in receiving touchdowns is eager to return to the field Saturday (8 p.m., BTN), when the Scarlet Knights host No. 4 Michigan State at High Point Solutions Stadium. \n\"I've very confident in his ability to lead,'' Rutgers interim head coach Norries Wilson said. \"He's made some mistakes. He's not perfect. And he's stepped up and owned up to his mistakes. That's behind him now and we're going to go forward now and just take it day-by-day.'' \nKeith Sargeant may be reached at ksargeant@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @KSargeantNJ .
