He admitted to drinking earlier that day, according to a report obtained from the Avon Police department.\nAccording to the report, Colleen Elizabeth Crowley, Manziel's girlfriend, said he also pushed her head into the window of his white Nissan. However she did not want to press charges. A witness said Manziel was driving at a high speed and that Crowley was attempting to exit the vehicle before they stopped.\n\"We were aware of the situation,\" Browns general manager Ray Farmer said in a statement. \"It is a matter that we take seriously and have expressed our concerns to Johnny directly. Those conversations will remain private and we will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\nUSA TODAY\nJohnny Manziel's mentor: Browns QB will make 'heckuva recovery' after rehab\nCleveland's WEWS-TV , an ABC affiliate, first broke the story.\nManziel took to Twitter to Friday to offer his side.\nColleen and I got into a dumb public argument on the way home Monday afternoon.

By most accounts, he's been a model teammate this year and won his only start last month in place of injured Browns starter Josh McCown.\nNeither Manziel nor Crowley were charged by authorities, who believed neither was intoxicated.\nFOR THE WIN\nJohnny Manziel, girlfriend release statements after police encounter\nThey left the scene together.\nCrowley posted the following statement on Instagram:\nBefore things get blown out of proportion.\nA photo posted by Colleen Crowley (@coll_crowley) on Oct 16, 2015 at 3:15pm PDT", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/86jZOzlA-y/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebc9519ac086054fa5092ba711393606fbfe81d3/r=300/https/i1.wp.com/usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/usp_nfl__cleveland_browns_at_san_diego_chargers_76481392.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655166174418870272", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655165925822480384", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/johnny-manziel-girlfriend-statement-cleveland-browns", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655166124254994436", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b04a6664f20e6990cee1b3ff7ad38db152ba0ca7/c=0-0-3186-3186/local/-/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767832901881475-USP-NFL-Preseason-Cleveland-Browns-at-Tampa-Bay-B.jpg", "http://www.newsnet5.com/sports/police-report-johnny-manziel-pulled-over-during-domestic-argument-admits-to-drinking", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/browns/2015/09/02/johnny-manziels-mentor-browns-qb-make-heckuva-recovery-after-rehab/71565376/"], "published": "2015-10-17T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:51:58.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
