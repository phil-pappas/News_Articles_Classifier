The reigning SEC Player of the Week and national player of the week according to multiple media outlets has completed 58 percent of his passes (a little down from last season) for 1,101 yards, eight touchdowns and just two interceptions, and he’s added 368 yards and five more scores on the ground. When Dobbs is on his game, he’s one of the SEC's best and most dynamic quarterbacks, and he presents all sorts of problems for opposing defenses. \n\nSophomore running back Jalen Hurd : Statistics alone hardly tell the story of Hurd's sophomore season to this point, because he's had to get a lot of yards on his own. Fortunately for the Vols, though, the 6-foot-4, 242-pound Hurd is comfortably capable of doing exactly that. The surprisingly nimble and balanced big man has collected 572 yards and seven touchdowns on 126 carries through the Vols' first six games, and he's added 85 yards and one touchdown through the air. He also picks up blitzes with ease and makes defenders think twice about pinning their ears back and coming at Dobbs in the backfield. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wbir.com/1LAsJnJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:40:55.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
