Small schools start playoffs By Zach James Herald Assistant Sports Editor The Clinton Herald \nCLINTON — It’s playoff time for the Iowa Class 1A and 2A volleyball teams. \nThe Class 1A and 2A regional volleyball tournaments begin Tuesday with two area teams — Easton Valley and Marquette Catholic — facing off against once another. \nEaston Valley (10-14) has faced the Mohawks (19-7) three times this season, and the River Hawks have dropped all three matches. In the latter matchup of the three, however, Easton Valley took game No. 2 against Marquette 21-18 last Saturday. \n“We’re always on the edge,” Easton Valley Coach Denise Larson said. “We’re competing. Sometimes we just can’t come out on top.” \nThe River Hawks have won back-to-back matches just twice this season, but Larson points to its Oct. 1 win over Midland as the turning point of the season. \n“Midland match was finally a night where mental toughness and everything else just clicked,” Larson said. “They want to win. They let fear jump in occasionally, I hope tomorrow that doesn’t happen.” \nInjuries and illness has bitten the River Hawks this season, and senior Sabrina Bormann has a banged-up thumb, but Larson said the 2014 second-team All-Tri Rivers Conference player will take the court. \n“She’s one of those players who refuses to sit out,” Larson said. “It’s been an annoyance for her more than anything. I’m going to put her in a different role, put her in back row.” \nBormann is fourth among River Hawks in kills (58) while the team leader is junior Kalli Miller with 208, which is second-most in the Tri-Rivers East. \nLarson’s keys to the game is to be sharp on defense. \n“I feel like our offense part of our game is intact, and comfortable,” Larson said. “It comes down to defense. I have kids who like to block and play the net. We just have to pursue in the back row and commit and not let the ball get on the ground. I don’t think Marquette is thrilled to play us (tomorrow).” \nMarquette, meanwhile, hasn’t had the type of season it had last year, but is still a team to be respected. \nThe Mohawks won their first seven matches in what Coach Andy Bishop calls a “hot start,” but then when they went to Wyoming for the Midland Tournament, they lost all four matches. \n“It was a good learning experience,” Bishop said of the Midland Tournament. “We hit a good s ride after that, and put together a few wins and losses. We’re a young team.” \nJunior Marissa Schroeder leads the Mohawks with 104 kills, but hit a roadblock with a sprained ankle before the Midland Tournament. \n“We switched her outside to fill new position, and it’s been a learning experience for her,” Bishop said. \nBishop’s key for his team to make a second consecutive state tournament run is simple — to have confidence. \n“Just make plays where we know we can,” Bishop said. Anna (Ambrosy) is good passer, and Taylor Banowetz is a good defensive specialist, and as long as we get good offense, we seem to have a nice blend of power and intelligence. That makes us hard to handle.” \nThe winner of the Easton Valley-Marquette match will see the winner of Prince of Peace at Midland in Class 1A-Region 7. \nThe Irish (4-17) won two of their last three matches, and like last season, two of their wins came on the road against Rivermont Collegiate. \n“It’s been such a total team effort, and it’s a huge confidence boost,” Irish Co-Coach Jessica Malueg said. “They work hard everyday to master the position that we moved them to.” \nMalueg and the other Irish coach, Joy Evans, recruited some familiar faces to come back out, and also made adjustments to make the puzzle pieces fit. For example, Krista Atkinson moved from the outside to the setter position. \n“I had to get used to not getting as many hits and not being able to dig as much,” Atkinson said. “But, I mean, I’d rather be setting to help my team out. \nIf the Irish win, they will head to Bellevue next Tuesday night to face the winner between Easton Valley and Marquette Catholic. Those two teams square off in Bellevue at 7 p.m. \nCalamus-Wheatland has a first-round bye, and will face the winner of Tuesday’s match between Lone Tree and Cedar Valley Christian. \nMeanwhile, in Class 2A, Bellevue opens its Region 7 opener with a road game at Clarence against North Cedar. The Comets have won three times this season with wins against Northeast, Prince of Peace and Rivermont Collegiate. \nSophomore Emma Kelchen leads the Comets with 134 kills.
