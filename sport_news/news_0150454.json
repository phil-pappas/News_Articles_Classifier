Look for area teams, particularly those in Onslow County, to make noise in the postseason, but what else is new? Onslow soccer ranks among the state’s best and county teams often compete for state titles. However, which teams will go the furthest come playoff time? That remains a big question, given what’s already transpired. Normally there has been at least one area squad – most notably Jacksonville in recent years – that has carried the gauntlet in terms of being the area’s best team, but this year is different. Case in point is the race for the Coastal 3-A Conference title, which is in a virtual three-way tie at the top. Swansboro (12-3, 3-1) has a win at White Oak (12-4, 5-1) but lost at Jacksonville (5-3-4, 3-1) while the Vikings have a victory over the Cardinals. “Everybody is going to be scratching to the end,” JHS coach Dave Miller said. “Our conference is wide open.” My prediction is that Swansboro wins the conference title because of its defense – the Pirates have allowed just 10 goals behind a sold backfield. Still, White Oak has its best team in recent seasons, and the Vikings are one of the area’s better scoring teams. Meanwhile, Jacksonville isn’t as strong as the last 10 teams that reached the East Regional finals as the Cardinals have struggled at times finishing. But they’ve kept themselves in games because of their defense, and last Tuesday’s 3-2 overtime win over Swansboro showed that Jacksonville was, well, Jacksonville. You can never count out the Cardinals. Richlands (8-7, 2-3) sits in fifth place in the seven-team Coastal Conference, but the Wildcats have won three consecutive games and should not be overlooked, especially when senior Roman Eddleman (14 goals) is playing well. Regardless of what happens in the conference race, though, don’t be surprised if some of these teams meet in the playoffs. It happens just about every year. Individually, seniors Gabe Krueger of White Oak and Kyle McGovern of Swansboro stand out. Krueger seems to have a multiple goal-scoring effort every game – he has 16 goals and seven assists – and is a strong candidate for The Daily News offensive player of the year award. McGovern, a 6-foot-3 goalkeeper and last year’s defensive player of the year, is having another strong season between the pipes. McGovern sports a 0.7 goals against average and has 10 shutouts. And while the Coastal Conference is a cluster, the same can be said about the East Central 2-A Conference, which I ultimately think Dixon (9-4-1, 2-1) wins. I also believe the Bulldogs’ talent makes them having the best chance to advance to Raleigh to play for a state championship. The return of all-state senior Carter Phillips from an early season injury will also bolster Dixon’s chances, although the Bulldogs did play quite well in his absence. Page 2 of 2 - North Brunswick (7-4-2, 1-0-1) leads the ECC almost by default given the Scorpions have had some games postponed because of rain while East Duplin (9-5, 2-1) and Dixon follow. Croatan (6-5-3) is next at 2-1-1. Dixon will be hard to beat for the league title, although East Duplin showed it was a force with a recent victory over the Bulldogs. The Panthers have been really good at times and other times inconsistent. They lost at Southwest (4-7-1, 1-3) but came back and beat Dixon. Croatan, meanwhile, was unbeaten in its four matches before a 1-0 loss at East Duplin on Wednesday. However, the big story in the ECC is the season-ending wrist injury late last month to Southwest senior Noah Tausch. The forward was leading the area in scoring with 19 goals, and his presence was key for a young Stallions team, which lost 3-0 to Croatan and 6-0 to Dixon in the two games he’s been out. Rounding out the local list is Lejeune, which has lost all eight of its games. “I don’t think anybody has THE best team,” Miller said. “Each team has its strengths that can win them games, but at the same time their weaknesses can be their Achilles’ heel. You’ve seen a little bit of both in all the games.” Chris Miller can be contacted via email at chris.miller @jdnews.com or by calling 910-219-8472.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:35:14.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
