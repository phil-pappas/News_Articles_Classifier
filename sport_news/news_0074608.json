Bullrun, the winner, was also was in great distress after winning a fast paced race but felt better after first aid.\n\"We had to put Continental down,\" chief stipendiary steward Shujjat Hussain told TOI. \"However, Bullrun felt better after the first aid,\" he added.\nIntelligence, owned by former chairman Khushroo Dhunjibhoy , set a scorching pace for favourite Rigoletto, owned by same owner. She was followed by Pink Panther, Bold Appeal, Rigoletto, and the rest. The pace was such that the fancied duo Rigoletto and Continental was under pressure to hold position.\nJockey Trevor Patel, astride the favourite, made his move at 800 metres mark to take charge behind front-running Bold Appeal. With Bullrun too trying to catch front runners -Bold Appeal and Rigoletto -Suraj brought Continental from outside to close the gap. With about 250 metres left in the race, it was difficult to predict who the winner could be as all were bunched up tightly.\nBullrun got stronger at a crucial juncture with Continental running on his outside. Unfortunately, Continental slipped and fell down throwing jockey Suraj off the saddle. Even as Continental slipped, Bullrun threw another challenge and took a comfortable win. Rigo letto finished second while Bold Appeal was third. Jigsaw finished fourth. While Continental was put down, jockey Suraj escaped with a minor injury. \"I just hurt in my back,\" he told TOI.\nThere was a Stewards' enquiry to check whether Bullrun was responsible for the mishap. But since Bullrun had not even touched Continental, the Stewards decided not take any action.\nThe 10th and last race of the day was cancelled after jockeys refused to ride citing slippery condition of the track.\nDerby results with dividends 8.
