He is 8-for-16 from three-point range and averaging 12.3 points per game.\nAnd the most important factor is his willing defense at the wing spots.\n\"If they pick this up, I know that I will be here at least still getting paid NBA money,\" Bullock said Saturday with a laugh. \"I'm just trying to find a place, and Detroit would be the perfect place for me to be able to start my young career and actually be here and actually learn things as part of this system and organization.\n\"I've done my traveling already. I've been to L.A., I've been to Phoenix, and I'm just trying to find a home and just go out and play hard as I can.\"\nâ–  Still thinking: Van Gundy said he still is choosing among Morris, Stanley Johnson and Ersan Ilyasova at the forward spots in today's exhibition at San Antonio.\nContact Vince Ellis at vellis@freepress.com .
