A year and a half after his beloved Lyonnaise bouchon relocated west of the river, Barnett and former St. Jack bartender Tommy Klus opened the chic La Moule just four blocks from their old home. La Moule's main game is beautiful mussels, frites and Belgian beers, though a handful of St. Jack favorites make appearances. Klus, the whisky-savvy bartender behind the openings of Kask and Multnomah Whiskey Library, has built an approachable cocktail menu (drinks cost between $8-$10) with a European accent. Go French with the anise-forward A Niece Frappe, an icy, aperitif cocktail made with Ricard Pastis, lemon, mint and Peychaud's bitters, or Spanish with the mahogany-colored Lilah, mixing Oloroso sherry, Mellow Corn, Chartreuse and whiskey barrel bitters. Feeling more authentic? Stay true with a brew from the Belgian-centric beer list, which includes taps from St. Bernardus (Abt 12) and Liefmans (Goudenband) and bottles from Westmalle, Rochefort and more.\nOrder this: A Niece Frappe and a bowl of the moules mariniere with frites.\n2500 S.E.
