Rev. Jesse Jackson visited Odom Wednesday and, upon exiting the hospital, told reporters Odom was still on life support but that \"doctors felt he is much better off today than he was yesterday. At least there is some responsiveness now,\" as the Orange County Register reports. But sources tell TMZ that Jackson only spent a few minutes with Odom and is dead wrong; they claim Odom is still unconscious and unresponsive, has suffered from multiple strokes, and is on dialysis for kidney failure. Sources at the hospital previously told TMZ Odom had cocaine and opiates in his system, and track marks on one arm, when he was found. As for what went wrong, sources tell TMZ Odom's meltdown started Sunday after he heard about the latest episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians . On it, his ex-wife Khloe Kardashian was shown getting two phone calls from Odom, and Kim chastised her for flirting with him; Khloe was also shown expressing concern that Odom might lose control after a friend of his died, and leaving a club when she heard Odom was on his way in. Odom was upset about his portrayal on the show up until he was found Tuesday, the sources say. It was previously reported that Odom had been drinking cognac and taking either Viagra or an herbal substitute for Viagra; the substitute can restrict blood flow to organs and cause low blood pressure. Khloe, Kim, and Kris Jenner are with Odom, TMZ reports, but KUWTK is not filming there.
