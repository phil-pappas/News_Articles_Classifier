Reynolds Razorback Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen &#8212; The senior quarterback found himself in a familiar situation again Saturday, but was finally able to win the moment. Allen threw for 233 yards and three touchdowns on 19 of 31 passing. He surpassed Barry Lunney Jr. for sixth in program history with 5,792 yards in his Razorback career. Saturday was also his sixth career three-touchdown game. Arkansas receiver Drew Morgan &#8212; The junior receiver was fairly limited in the early going agains the Tigers' defense, but got it going in overtime when Allen threw his direction. Morgan led the team with six receptions for the game for 56 yards and two touchdowns, both in overtime. The scores were his first career touchdown catches beyond the first half. Auburn running back Peyton Barber &#8212; The Tigers' running back was a force on the ground once Gus Malzahn went to his bread and butter. Barber rushed for 120 yards and a game-high four touchdowns on 37 carries. His 120 yards rushing were good for a game high. Arkansas linebacker Dre Greenlaw &#8212; The freshman starred defensively for the Razorbacks' defense, especially late. His 16 tackles were a game high. Greenlaw was also credited with a pass breakup and tallied seven more tackles than Arkansas' second leading tackler (Rohan Gaines, Brooks Ellis, Josh Liddell all with nine). Arkansas running back Kody Walker &#8212; Despite not having played since Arkansas' upset loss in Little Rock to Toledo, Walker played a key role in the Razorbacks' win over Auburn. Walker rushed eight times for 32 yards and a pair of scores and was successful on Arkansas' two-point conversion attempt in the fourth overtime period. &#8212; Scottie Bordelon &#8226; sbordelon@swtimes.com By Eric W. BolinArkansas News Bureau • ebolin@arkansasnews.com \nFAYETTEVILLE — “I hate Auburn.” \nBret Bielema famously said those words four months ago. It immediately made the Arkansas-Auburn game the most anticipated on the Razorbacks schedule. \nIndependent of all things before for both teams, an Arkansas loss to Auburn would have been, at best, disappointing considering those three words. Take real life into consideration, with Arkansas’ and Auburn’s disappointing starts, and a loss to Auburn would have been near-catostrophic. \nWhen Arkansas finally came through victorious, 54-46, in four overtimes, the school’s athletic director Jeff Long was emotional. Bielema was, too. But unlike times before, the coach didn’t let loose tears. This was more like a sigh of relief, an almost confirmation his track is the right one in Fayetteville. \nThe Razorbacks get a slight break with Tennessee-Martin for homecoming on Halloween before the final meat of the schedule — at Ole Miss, at LSU, and hosting Mississippi State and Missouri — makes or breaks the team’s bowl eligibility. \nThey Said It \n“Rawleigh underwent successful surgery Saturday night after injuring his neck in the third quarter of yesterday’s game. He is expected to make a full recovery. A timetable for his return to the football field is unclear, but we are thankful that he is doing well and is with his family. Thank you to everyone for the well wishes, thoughts and prayers.” — Arkansas coach Bret Bielema statement Sunday on injury suffered against Auburn \n“We beat Auburn, an SEC West team that we hadn’t been able to beat since I’ve been here. We’re slowly trying to notch one off one game at a time. … I think does a lot for confidence.” — Bielema on importance of win going forward \n“I came in here with Brandon and I love him to death. He takes so much unnecessary stuff. Those losses get pinned on him a lot. I think this was big for him. He played his butt off. We got this for him and he got it for us. He was clutch.” — Arkansas running back Kody Walker on quarterback Brandon Allen’s late-game performance \n“I thought he was really locked in. What’s been challenging to Dan is you go through the entire spring, you get a feel for what your offense is going to be, then you have so many guys bang up. He’s kind of had to adjust on the fly.” — Bielema on offensive coordinator Dan Enos’ game and season-opening \nBy The Numbers \n11/3/03 — Arkansas’ four-overtime win over Auburn marked the first game of more than three overtimes the Razorbacks have had since November 3, 2003 against Kentucky. The Razorbacks won that game, 71-63. \n5,792 — Allen passed tight ends coach Barry Lunney Jr. on the Razorbacks all-time passing yardage chart with his 233 yards against Auburn. Allen’s 5,792 yards are 10 more than Lunney and good for sixth in school history. \n34 in 3 — Arkansas freshman linebacker Dre Greenlaw had 16 tackles Saturday, a team high. He now has 34 tackles in his last three games and is 12th in the SEC overall with 53 tackles this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:58:34.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
