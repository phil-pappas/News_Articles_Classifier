You have to see things live to get comfortable with it. Jeff is a player we believe in.\n“He is not always going to play a great game, nobody does ... He was very poised, we protected him well, and the receivers really played well. They made some big plays for him. He was accurate.”\nFitting that Mathews’ first touchdown pass in the CFL was to Luke Tasker, who was open to take a nine-yard toss from Mathews in the second quarter. Tasker was a recipient of many a Mathews pass when the two were teammates at Cornell University from 2010-12, with Austin their coach.\n“Things just kind of work out weird,” Austin said. “We’re just really happy they are both on our team.”\nTasker might have to buy Mathews dinner. In celebrating the major, he threw the football into the stands, denying Mathews the souvenir.\n“Pretty selfish of me and I told him that,” Tasker said with a smile. “It’s meaningful for me. It’s crazy, you know? If you would have told either of us four years ago it would have happened like that, I would have been ‘My gosh, you serious? That’s awesome.’\n“He threw the lights out. Ran the ball well. He looked veteran out there, he looked confident. He made smart decisions all day.”\nThat’s crucial for the Ticats heading into the final four games of the regular season, with three of those on the road. A season-ending knee injury to Collaros forced Mathews into a starting role for which he initially was not ready considering his lack of experience. Mathews has no choice but to learn on the job, and after a couple of bumpy performances, was in command from start to finish on Friday night.\nMathews committed six turnovers combined in a relief appearance against Edmonton last month and in his first CFL start last week, but had none against Saskatchewan. His decision-making and patience led to some gains that might otherwise have not been attained, whether it was finding open receivers or knowing when to hold on to the football and get yardage with his feet.\n“I don’t think (confidence gets a boost) too much,” Mathews said. “I believe in myself regardless of the situation. As a team, to get a win after two losses is huge.”\nThat first TD pass had to feel good.\n“More like a weight off your back after playing in three games,” Mathews said. “It’s done with and we can just go play and not think about it. It was fun. We had some guys make some incredible plays.”\nTerrell Sinkfield recorded a career-high 163 receiving yards on four catches, with an 87-yard touchdown in the third quarter the longest play from scrimmage for Hamilton in 2015. Mathews also threw a touchdown pass to Tiquan Underwood, and Justin Medlock booted three field goals.\nHamilton had a 20-0 lead at halftime, with Saskatchewan getting touchdowns from Weston Dressler in the third quarter and Ryan Smith in the fourth. Brett Smith replaced an ineffective Kevin Glenn at quarterback after the half.\nBrandon Stewart and Courtney Stephen had interceptions for Hamilton and the defence held running back Jerome Messam to eight yards on five carries.\nHamilton improved to 9-5, giving it sole possession of first place in the East Division, two points ahead of both the Toronto Argonauts and Ottawa RedBlacks. The loss officially eliminated Saskatchewan (2-13) from playoff contention.\n“If we win our games, it doesn’t matter (what other teams do),” Austin said. “We have to take care of our own business.”\nterry.koshan@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/koshtorontosun\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nCFL\nTiger-Cats take advantage of poor Roughriders defence\nBy Terry Koshan , Toronto Sun First posted: Friday, October 09, 2015 11:17 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 10, 2015 12:05 AM EDT\nPerhaps the Hamilton Tiger-Cats won’t have to worry as much about the absence of Zach Collaros as we might have thought.\nA disclaimer, sure: We know it was the worst defence in the Canadian Football League that Jeff Mathews beat up on Friday night at Tim Hortons Field.\nStill, there had been no guarantee Mathews was capable of as much in his second CFL start.\nWith the talent-challenged Saskatchewan Roughriders providing the opposition, Mathews passed for 385 yards, completing 22 of 33 passes, and threw for three touchdowns in the Tiger-Cats’ 30-15 victory before a crowd of 24,222.\nHamilton improved to 9-5, giving it sole possession of first place in the East Division, two points ahead of both the Toronto Argonauts and Ottawa RedBlacks.
