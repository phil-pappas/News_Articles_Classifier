My journey is just starting, his is coming to an end. \n\"I want the big fights, I want to unify titles. First I have to beat Bute and he wants his old belt back. (But) I'm too young, too fresh, and too good. Much too good.\" \nBute has struggled to convince in his three fights since facing Froch and was handed his second defeat as a professional by Jean Pascal. \nHis challenge of DeGale - the first time boxing will be staged at the recently opened 18,000-seat Centre Videotron, the home of hockey team Quebec Remparts - represents his first for a world title since losing his undefeated status and is for the same one he lost to DeGale's retired domestic rival. \n\"Last time I was here I lost my title in 2012 but that is in the past,\" said Bute, who has since switched trainers to Howard Grant. \n\"I have a new team behind me and I will become a world champion again. This is big for me because I had this belt for five years. On November 28 I get it back. Thanks to James for the opportunity. I have never lost in Quebec City - I will be the new world champion.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:51:54.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
