(Gary Wiepert | The Associated Press) Comments \nOrchard Park, N.Y. — EJ Manuel had a chance to be the story on Sunday. For a moment, it almost felt like he would be, too. \nEverything was set up for the former first-round pick. A year ago, Manuel was benched 14 games into his career after a dreadful performance against the Houston Texans. Most thought he wouldn't get another chance, and he spent the rest of the season riding the pine. An offseason coaching change brought renewed hope for Manuel, but a three-way quarterback competition landed him third on the depth chart. \nThen, in the span of a month, Matt Cassel was traded and starter Tyrod Taylor suffered a knee injury. Just like that, Manuel was thrust into the starting lineup against the Cincinnati Bengals, and reports surfaced that an inspiring performance from Manuel could spark a quarterback controversy. \n» Observations | Recap \nOn the first drive of the game, Manuel led the Buffalo Bills down into the red zone. On third down, the 6-foot-5, 230-pound quarterback with all of the tools scrambled right and powered his way into the end zone. He charged straight for the fans at Ralph Wilson Stadium, who embraced him with open arms as the Bills took a 7-0 lead over the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals. \nThat moment was fleeting. For the rest of the game, Manuel looked like the backup he is. He was far from the reason the Bills got throttled 34-21 by the Bengals, but he also looked like mostly the same quarterback that couldn't hold off Kyle Orton for the starting job a year ago. He missed open receivers, threw inaccurate passes and finished with a mediocre state line of 28-for-42, 263 passing yards, one touchdown passing, one touchdown rushing and an interception. \n\"It's been a long time,\" Manuel said. \"I thought it went alright, but at the end of the day we didn't win, and that's the toughest part. Performance-wise, of course there are some things I wish that I could have done better, but I thought it was solid.\" \nThat might be the best way to describe Manuel's day. If there were improvements in his game, they were subtle. He looked a bit more confident in the pocket and wasn't hesitant to run the football. All in all, he looked like a backup quarterback, albeit a slightly improved one. \n\"I think he's a lot more comfortable, a lot more confident,\" wide receiver Robert Woods said. \"I think he's finally being comfortable, stepping up in the pocket, making some throws and playing his game.\" \nMaybe his game is just what the Bills got from him Sunday. Manuel hasn't been told whether he will return to the bench when Taylor is healthy or how close Taylor is to getting healthy. For now, Manuel will do what all backup quarterbacks do. He'll wait and see. If his number is called when the Bills play the Jaguars in London next week, Manuel will likely be the same inconsistent quarterback he's been throughout his career. \nDon't get it confused, either. Cassel wouldn't have been much better for the Bills Sunday, despite the criticism the Bills took for trading the veteran away. Backup quarterbacks are, for the most part, interchangeable. Rare is the backup who can play like a starter when called upon. \nThose hoping Manuel had transformed into that type of quarterback in his time away didn't get their wish Sunday. With a chance to step into the spotlight, Manuel was just another guy against the Bengals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:59:14.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
