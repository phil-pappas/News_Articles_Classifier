Brazilian defender Alves drove a 20-yard free kick that ricocheted off several legs and skidded past Gallardo. It wasn’t as dramatic as Jerome’s effort, but it counted just the same. \nMoments later, Ubiparipovic took possession just inside the Armada box and lofted a smooth chip that floated over Gallardo and dipped under the bar. \nOttawa’s Andrew Wiedeman scored in stoppage time to cap the night and clinch the fall championship, as Fury players carried coach Marc Dos Santos aloft in celebration. \nThe Armada heads to FC Edmonton on Sunday, the club’s last chance to prevent a winless road season in its debut. \n“There’ll be a lot of pride in us going on the road, trying to find a result,” Dade said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:16:23.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
