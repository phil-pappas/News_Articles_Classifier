(21Alive) – The Fort Wayne Mad Ants will introduce their new head coach on Friday. As 21Alive first told you last Friday, the new head man will be former Mad Ants Assistant and Interim coach Steve Gansey. \nThe franchise has called an 11 a.m. news conference at Memorial Coliseum, where new Ants general manager Brian Levy will make the announcement. \nThe coaching change comes as Conner Henry left the Ants in June to become head coach of the NBA Development League’s Los Angeles D-Fenders. Henry has since been hired as an assistant coach on the Orlando Magic. \nLast month, the Pacers Sports & Entertainment bought the Mad Ants, and named Levy general manager.
