David Rudd exchanged hugs and high-fives on the sidelines.\nWhat didn’t seem possible four years ago when Bowen accepted the AD job was coming to fruition before his eyes and more than 60,000 fans at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium.\nThe Tigers moved to 6-0 with the win and will move into the Top 25 when the Associated Press releases its poll today. The U of M likely will move up in the Amway Coaches Poll, where they ranked 22nd last week.\nBowen and Rudd were among the university officials celebrating the win, a celebration that, for Bowen, began hours earlier on Tiger Lane.\nBowen said he became “emotional” as the team went through its traditional Tiger Walk. And, he said, most of it had to do with the multitudes who greeted the team as it arrived.\nBowen said the crowd “was five deep all around” as the players walked from a midway point on Tiger Lane to the fountain area. There routinely are crowds and the U of M band to greet the team, but not to match the size of Saturday’s gathering.\nThe overall atmosphere with the packed stadium — an announced crowd of 60,241, in addition to the hype surrounding the game — was electric.\n“It’s what I always dreamed of when I took the job and after our first season,” Bowen said. “I dreamed this would happen. I wanted this to happen and to happen on a consistent basis.\n“It was 41,000 at the opener (against Missouri State), it was 45,000 against Cincinnati and now almost 60,000. Who would have thought?”\nBowen said he and Tiger coach Justin Fuente always envisioned the football program could reach this stage. Memphis entered the game on a school-record 12-game win streak.\n“It’s one thing to believe it,” Bowen said. “It’s another thing to have it happen.\n“It’s a dream come true for me, professionally, to know I took the job in Memphis to build a great program in all sports. But football needed to do something like this. We needed this to happen for our future and for the future of what we are going to become.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:10:47.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
