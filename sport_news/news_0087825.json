Hyderabad : In yet another sign of brain gain, a group of Telugus settled in Silicon Valley have decided to relocate their start-up firm, Trupik Inc, from the global technology hub to Hyderabad. Trupik seeks to change the face of retailing by using 3D body mapping technology which allows users to have a better shopping experience. It has launched its app Trupik Connect on Friday in Hyderabad. “The 3D mapping used in the app allows users to see how the latest styles from their favourite brands will drape on them, virtually, on their 3D digital personas,” said Trupik CEO Sridhar Tirumala on Friday. Hyderabad will be the first city to experience Trupik Connect. Later, it will be rolled out to other parts of India. While currently it focuses on garments, Trupik Connect will soon expand to other fashion accessories. business Silicon Valley Trupik Inc Hyderabad Also Read BlackBerry plans sales sops to distributors; handset price may lower Audi launches Q3 Dynamic Consumers will soon be able to choose their power supply company No fine on zero balance a/c", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/trupik_20150326185002_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151017/business-latest/article/nris-shift-silicon-valley-firm-hyderabad", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/trupik_20150326185002_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:32:02.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
