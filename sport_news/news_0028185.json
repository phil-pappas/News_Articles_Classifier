He isn’t comfortable, necessarily, being in the limelight. But those inside the Blue Jays clubhouse will tell you that in all likelihood, no player dissects the game better and with more detail than does Encarnacion. \nSo, what has he seen through the first two disappointing results for the Blue Jays in the American League Division series? \nFor starters, he thinks the big boppers of which he is one, along with Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista — the 120-home run club — need to be less aggressive at the plate, smarter at the plate, “we’re swinging at too many bad pitches and making it easy for them. \n“The problem isn’t (defence),” he said. “The problem isn’t pitching. We haven’t been hitting. We’re not hitting the way we’re supposed to hit. For me, that’s the real problem. \n“We score a lot of runs. That’s our team. That’s what we do. We know we can hit. That what we need to start doing. \n“Listen, they’ve been pitching us good. But we’re not helping ourselves. They have a plan. We’ve been too aggressive. We’ve been swinging at too many bad pitches. We have to look for our pitch, be more patient, focus better. We do that, we win Game 3, and keep going from there.” \nEncarnacion actually thought he had hit a walkoff home run in the bottom of the 13th inning that would have won the Blue Jays Game 2. When it left his bat, he believed it was gone. The ball went deep to centre field. It looked like a home run, but just fell short with the roof closed at the Rogers Centre. \n“I must have just missed the ball a little bit,” he said. “Twice like that (in the series). I thought I had one.” \nThat’s how tight the results of this series have been: The Blue Jays lose Game 2 in the 14th inning. Encarnacion and many on the Jays bench thought they had it won in the 13th. \n“That’s baseball,” said Encarnacion. “We have to keep playing. We can’t let this happen. We’re a team that scores a lot of runs. I don’t hit the way I’m supposed to hit. \nI thought I got that one. It didn’t go.” \nPrivately, Donaldson, Bautista and Encarnacion have talked about what they have to do, how they have to change this series. They are, in essence, coaching each other, although they are certainly getting input from the Jays staff. \n“We know we’re veteran guys,” said Encarnacion. “We know what we have to do. We know how they’ve been pitching us. Now we have to play.” \nThis is part of the brilliance and the curse of this Blue Jays season, all at once. The history of baseball is that great pitching almost always beats great hitting. For every Reggie Jackson who becomes a World Series star for belting a bevy of home runs, there are more Madison Bumgarners or Orel Hershisers or Curt Schillings or Bob Gibsons to shut them down. \nMartin Perez pitches for the Rangers in Game 3 on Sunday night. He’s yet to be confused with Bumgarner or Gibson. Encarnacion knows that. This is an opportunity to force a fourth game. A rather relaxed Blue Jays team, considering the circumstances, seems to be in that mindset. \nManager John Gibbons takes it a step further. \n“Our record when we score four runs or less is pretty glaring,” he said. “We got four yesterday, three the day before that. In this case, the facts are the facts.” \nIn almost a quarter of the Jays’ games this season, they scored eight or more runs. They may not need eight Sunday night, but the thinking is they need more than four. \n“We’ve been a little bit sloppy so far,” said Gibbons. “I don’t know why that is. But if we score (the way they normally score) we win those games. \n“We’ve been shut down pretty good. We need to be who we are.” \n“I don’t think it’s insurmountable for us to go out and win three games,” added Chris Colabello, whose rise to the big leagues has been close to insurmountable. “You look around here today, you don’t see guys all tense or upset. We know what we’re capable of doing. \n“How can you get mad at a guy or hold a grudge against a guy when he makes a mistake out of aggression or passion? That’s why I love this baseball team. Look around the clubhouse, I don’t think anybody is feeling bad for themselves. There’s too much to do still, and we’re capable of doing it.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:07:57.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
