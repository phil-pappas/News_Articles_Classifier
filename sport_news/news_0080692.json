While the Knicks coach is trying to speed up the triangle offense, he has the same old defensive playbook that had the Knicks ranked last in the NBA in opponent’s 3-point field-goal percentage.\nNevertheless, one of the returning players, their best player, Carmelo Anthony is seeking more coaching on that end. Anthony said this week he hoped Fisher’s staff gets on him more for defensive lapses in the film room, making him an example.\nHas it happened yet?\n“I think he meant more than just in film sessions, for me to call him out more,’’ Fisher said. “Everybody gets their fair share. I think he’s just letting everyone know he’s accepting more leadership and expects to be held accountable.\n“Defense is always an area everyone’s leash is the same length. Everyone’s in the same boat.”\nIn one of the highlights of Friday’s 101-95 preseason win over the Celtics at the Garden, Anthony scrambled back on defense to block ex-Knick David Lee’s fast-break layup attempt late in the second quarter. Anthony had a poor shooting outing (4 of 14) in 22 minutes, but kept up on defense.\n“You have nights like this shooting, but defense you should never have off nights,’’ Anthony said.\nThe thought is if Anthony’s focus is defense, that mentality will spread like wildfire throughout the team. Last season, due to nagging injuries and a left knee that required in-season surgery, Anthony was more sluggish than usual on defense, slow in closing out at the 3-point line. But Fisher admits that 17-65 team had a roster that did not have a defensive mindset.\nThough the Knicks were roasted from the 3-point line last season, Fisher never took that deficiency to heart. The Knicks ranked 27th in opposing field-goal percentage (46 percent), but now they’ve added defensive center Robin Lopez and shooting guard Arron Afflalo, who made his preseason debut Friday. Fisher also pointed to the additions of speedy guards who can pressure the ball in rookie Jerian Grant and Langston Galloway, who was signed last January.\n“I don’t know if we have time for that,’’ Fisher said, when asked to reflect on last season’s defensive woes. “It’s last year. It’s gone. A lot of guys we had on the team are gone. Who we have now weren’t there. It sounds simple to say we have a different team. Robin Lopez is really good defensively. I don’t know how much to say it’s the players that will make the difference.’’\nLopez, the defensive pivot signed for four years and $54 million, sees a communicative group.\n“It’s important a lot of these guys understand defense is a team concept, a five-man concept and a lot of guys play with a lot of intensity,’’ he said. “We’ve been very vocal.’’\nLopez, in particular.\n“I’m trying to be a little more outspoken,’’ he said. “I know being in the back I’m somewhat of a leader on the defensive end. I’m trying to live up to that.’’\nAfflalo is also here to lead the defensive spirit.\n“My ability is the leadership standpoint on that end, keeping my teammates locked in on their assignments and staying focused and in tune,’’ Afflalo said. “I feel if we’re a good defensive team, we can get out and run.’’\nFisher got panned because of his belief allowing uncontested 3-pointers do not cost teams games despite the freewheeling Warriors’ NBA championship. Fisher has made no change in philosophy, but feels he has a deeper cast of defensive bigs to defend the paint and prevent scramble situations.\n“We haven’t completely changed anything, how we run the pick and roll,’’ Fisher said. “When you have 23 feet of bigs in the paint, it makes the paint look smaller. We got a good amount of guards developing well. [Cleanthony Early] is getting better. We have a number of guys who can do the things we need to do on both ends. I don’t think it’s strategy or Xs and Os. We have a team constructed that’s more balanced.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under arron afflalo ,  carmelo anthony ,  derek fisher ,  new york knicks ,  robin lopez", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:19:06.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
