Wade Spees/Staff × The Fort Dorchester Patriots, behind the strong play of sophomore quarterback Dakereon Joyner, rolled past the West Ashley Wildcats, 29-6, on a rainy Thursday night at Wildcat Stadium. Joyner completed 6 of 13 passes for 142 yards and two touchdowns, one a 96-yarder to senior Diondre Champaigne, and ran for 99 more in leading the undefeated Patriots to their seventh straight win. Senior Datron James added 64 yards on the ground for Fort Dorchester. The only bright spot for the Wildcats was junior Dexter Freeman, who ran for 57 yards and now has 1,021 on the season. Freeman was tackled for a loss six times in his 26 carries, as the Patriots’ defense rose to the challenge of stopping one of the Lowcountry’s leading rushers. ”They shut down some of the things that we wanted to do, “ said Wildcat coach Bobby Marion. “They whipped us on both sides of the ball.” The Patriots opened the scoring midway through the first quarter when Joyner scored from 13 yards to make it 8-0 after a two-point conversion. Later in the quarter, Joyner hit Nick Dederick on a five-yard scoring pass to make the lead 15-0. After a fumbled punt snap, the Patriots drove 32 yards and senior Datron James ran in from two yards in the second quarter to make it 22-0. West Ashley seemed to have the Patriots pinned deep in their own territory after a 42-yard punt from Benjamin Johnson. But on their first play from scrimmage, Joyner hit a streaking Champaigne over the middle for a 96-yard score. West Ashley scored with 26 seconds when Freeman scored from one yard to make the final 29-6. The field conditions deteriorated quickly throughout the night, as a heavy rain soaked the field most of the game. Joyner was very elusive for the Patriots, a fact not lost on Marion. “Their quarterback ran well and threw much better than we thought he would. That’s a good, physical football team over there. And Coach LaPrad has a healthy team now.” West Ashley’s record fell to 3-3.
