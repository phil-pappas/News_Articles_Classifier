Under the lottery format, registered fans were randomly selected for the chance to purchase tickets that were released each month for future games. \n\"I don't like the fact that you have to be in the lottery to see if you get a ticket,\" said Cavs fan Daniel Aponte. \"I would rather be able to walk up and see if I want some tickets and buy them.\" \nThis year, fans will have the opportunity to purchase tickets for any regular-season game. \nSimilar to last season, there will be more than 50,000 individual tickets available for purchase throughout the season. \nThis process adjustment was determined based on fan feedback, monitoring of game-by-game demand for ticket inventory and purchasing data last season. \nRELATED | Cavaliers hit ground running on first day of camp \n\"I heard they are doing dynamic pricing so there will be different prices for different games,\" said fan Erica Aber. \"It makes sense because a lot of teams across the league are doing that, so I know people fill the seats.\" \nDemand on a game-by-game basis determines prices. And the price for the first regular-season home game, the night before Halloween, may be a little scary. \nThe cheapest ticket we found Wednesday night was selling for $99 in the farthest section from the court. If you want something up close, prices reach as high as $8,025. \n\"That's not surprising,\" said Aber. \nBut tickets do get much cheaper when we're not talking about the home opener against the Miami Heat. \nStill, ticket pricing increased 15 percent from last season to this season. This is the first time the ticket prices have increased in the last five seasons. \n\"I will still go, it don't matter,\" said Aponte. \nREAD MORE | Cavs optimistic Tristan Thompson deal will get done \n\"It makes sense after we reached the finals,\" said Aber. \"They had to ease into it because we had a few years of bad seasons. And finally we got some wins under our belt.\" \nAnother difference comes with the demand for season tickets. Last year, season tickets sold out in 24 hours. This year, there are still some available. \nFollow WKYC's Wale Aliyu on Twitter @WaleAliyu and on Facebook at facebook.com/WaleAliyuTV <!--iframe--> Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1FGBg86 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:23:56.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
