The Rota Admirals blasted the visiting Alconbury Dragons 48-8 to move to within one home-field victory of a European championship shot. \nThe Admirals will host fourth-seeded Hohenfels next weekend. The Tigers beat SHAPE 28-8 on Saturday to advance. \nRota burst out of the locker room with 21 first-quarter points to put the game away early. Andres Torres scored twice as part of an eight-carry, 125-yard effort, and teammates Jake Anderson, Andrew Flemming, Marc Magwood and D'Angelo Gallardo joined him in the scoring column to round out the rout. \nArmani Walker made 12 tackles to lead the defense, while Damaris Barkley returned an interception 15 yards for a Rota touchdown. \nFritz Sherenco threw for 57 yards and a touchdown and Adarius Gallon carried 16 times for 82 yards to lead Alconbury. \nThe win continues a breakout season for the Admrials, who are just two years removed from a winless season. New coach Ken Walter guided Rota to a 5-0 regular season and the division's top overall seed this fall. Alconbury won its last two games of the regular season to earn the bracket's last playoff berth.
