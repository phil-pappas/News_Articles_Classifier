Militia secures home-field advantage in upcoming NEFL playoffs 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \nAfter three months and 10 regular-season games failed to determine a champion in the New England Football League ’s Colonial Conference Southern Division, a coin-toss was used to determine which team — the Western Connecticut Militia of Danbury or the Connecticut Panthers of Meriden, who finished with identical 9-1 records and split their two regular-season meetings — would earn the top seed and home-field advantage in the upcoming playoffs. \nThe Militia won the toss, and with it a bye in this weekend’s wild-card playoff round. The Militia will host either the Hartford Colts or the Pioneer Valley Knights in the divisional playoff round next weekend at a time and site to be determined. \nThe Militia secured a share of the division lead with a 42-12 victory over Pioneer Valley on Saturday. Quarterback Kevin Oberg completed touchdown passes to Kreston Harrison , Ryan Mack and Matt Tyrell . Aaron Taylor rushed for two touchdowns and Lionel Assie rushed for one. Tyler Kurjiaka added a 41-yard field goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:04:58.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
