(Photo courtesy of Israel Carunungan) Tim Schwartz Contact Reporter Rivals River Hill and Atholton square off on Oct. 23 as both teams battle for playoff position \nAs the Howard County football season winds down, inching closer to the playoffs, teams' true identities are starting to show. \nFor Atholton, which started the season 1-3 after a 34-0 shutout at home versus Wilde Lake, that sentiment is holding true, as the Raiders have won three straight games to improve to 4-3 to jump into playoff contention. \nRiver Hill, meanwhile, is still looking to find its groove as it sits at 3-4 on the season, but the Hawks’ schedule is favorable the rest of the way. \nWhen the two squads face off on Oct. 23 at River Hill, it could in all likelihood make or break each team’s season. \n“It’s a huge game. This is the biggest game within the last three or four years for the program, not only because we’re above .500 and we have a chance to go to the playoffs, but the extra incentive is we play River Hill, our rivals,” said Atholton coach Bruce Cummings. “So we have a chance to not only get in the playoffs by beating them, but crushing our rivals' dreams of getting in the playoffs as well. That adds a little more fire to the game, and makes it really important to everybody on the team and coaching staff.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:35:03.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
