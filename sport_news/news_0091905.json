He got into the ensuing special teams huddle, pushed Street, had to be removed and yelled at Bryant who was trying to play peacemaker.\nContentious?\n“Yeah, because it was surprising that he was in there. When he came he kinda pushed me,’’ Street said. “I didn’t realize who it was. I was like who is this? Then once you realize it’s Greg, he was like you need to make a play. That was our fault to give up that lead and he was just showing us the passion we need to fix it.’’\nhttps://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js \nHardy answered all eight questions from the media with “No comment. Any other questions?” Neither owner Jerry Jones nor coach Jason Garrett had an issue with Hardy’s outburst.\n“We’ve got to get the job done. We can’t keep coming out here getting Ls. We’ve got to go through our week preparation better, figure it out,’’ receiver Terrance Williams said.\n“Turnovers are what killed us,” quarterback Matt Cassel said. “It lies on my shoulders, obviously. … I’ve got to correct those things and give our team an opportunity to win.\n“I have to do a better job.’’\nDallas has lost all four games since Tony Romo broke his collarbone in Week 2. With Romo ineligible to return until Nov. 22, they traded for Cassel on Sept. 22 and — after a bye week to get up to speed — he debuted Sunday by going 17 of 27 for 227 yards and a touchdown, but had three costly second-half picks.\nThe first came on a poor sideline route by Williams, with Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie returning a the ball 58 yards for a touchdown — the last 35 of it high-stepping for a 17-13 lead. Another got caught up in the wind and intercepted by Brandon Meriweather at the Giants’ 1-yard line. The Giants drove for field goal to make it 20-13.\nRodgers-Cromartie picked Cassel off again on the first play of the fourth quarter. Cassel did manage a game-tying TD to Street, but after the Giants’ kick-return touchdown he couldn’t get the Cowboys back in the end zone.\n“I saw some him do some things out there that could’ve helped us win that game,” Jones said. “And obviously those turnovers are backbreakers.”\n“We will go with Cassel certainly against Seattle and, certainly as far as I can see, the foreseeable future. … Now if you’re asking me if I’m confident that Cassel can help us win several of the next ballgames, I don’t know that.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under dallas cowboys ,  greg hardy ,  new york giants", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:57:15.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
