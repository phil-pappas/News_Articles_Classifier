Last season, they were in the AFC Championship Game, one step away from the ultimate game. So what’s changed? Here’s a quick look:\nRUNNING BACK\nWhat’s new: Veteran Frank Gore was signed to be the primary back. He’s essentially replacing the combination of Daniel “Boom” Herron, Ahmad Bradshaw and Trent Richardson, who all took turns as the main man last season.\nSkinny: Gore is a veteran who, while not quite in his prime, provides some stability at a position that’s caused them fits in recent years. He’s averaging 4.3 yards per carry and coming off his best game (22 carries, 98 yards).\nWIDE RECEIVER\nWhat’s new: They essentially swapped out one veteran for another, as Reggie Wayne was replaced by Andre Johnson. They also drafted University of Miami wideout Phillip Dorsett with their first-round pick (29th overall).\nSkinny: Johnson has been slow to adapt to the offense or click with Andrew Luck. He was better against his former team, the Titans, last week with two touchdowns. Dorsett, a surprise first-round pick given needs in other areas, fumbled twice in the season opener on punts. He’s their third receiver option.\nDEFENSIVE LINE\nWhat’s new: They start two Stanford rookies — Henry Anderson at tackle and David Parry at nose tackle. Free agent Kendall Langford was signed from the Rams.\nSkinny: There was some panic when Arthur Jones went on injured reserve, but Anderson has played well. Ditto Parry. Their emergence allowed the Colts to cut Josh Chapman, last year’s starting nose tackle, and Montori Hughes. Langford, sort of an afterthought as a free agent pickup, also has played well. They did a good job last week against the Texans’ Arian Foster.\nThus far the line, a trouble spot last season, is performing better with the young players.\nQUARTERBACK\nWhat’s new: Questioning of the franchise quarterback.\nSkinny: Luck struggled in his first three games and has missed the last two with a shoulder injury. In his absence, the Colts won both games under veteran Matt Hasselbeck, who has a much different style. He gets the ball away quicker and makes few mistakes. There’s been a movement now for Luck, who holds the ball forever, and thus gets hit and sacked a lot, to do the same. Whether Luck will be willing to play a little more like Hasselbeck remains to be seen.\nFRONT OFFICE\nWhat’s new: Turmoil. In-house sniping between coach Chuck Pagano and general manager Ryan Grigson.\nSkinny: Pagano is now a lame-duck coach, which is never a good situation. When owner Jim Irsay decided not to extend Pagano’s contract, the relationship with Grigson started to unravel. Rumors, while premature, already have begun to swirl about his successor, whether it’s Nick Saban, Sean Payton or any other popular names currently making the rounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:24:40.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
