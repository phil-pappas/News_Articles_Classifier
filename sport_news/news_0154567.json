But Bradwell’s defense stiffened in the second quarter. \n“They played hard,” Hidalgo said. “They were in a tough situation, but they didn’t quit.” \nBanks Entwistle kicked a 33-yard field goal in the third quarter to put Glynn ahead 17-0, and Dallas later scored on a 7-yard run to cap a 75-yard drive. \nDallas rushed for 108 yards and three touchdowns and passed for 112 yards and a touchdown in his first start at quarterback last week, a 49-7 win over Richmond Hill. \nHe’ll get a more stern test next Friday, when Glynn travels to Waycross to take on the undefeated Ware County Gators. \nGlynn Academy 24, Bradwell Institute 0 \nBI — 0 0 0 0 — 0 \nGA — 14 0 3 7 — 24 \nGA — Deejay Dallas 14 run (Scout Churchwell kick) \nGA — Dallas 1 run (Banks Entwistle kick) \nGA — Entwistle 33 field goal \nGA — Dallas 7 run (Churchwell kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:31:16.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
