(Photo: ED WRIGHT) \nChurchill's defensive back wall was outstanding all night, keeping the Patriots' side of the scoreboard bare except for the penalty-kick goal. \nAmong the defenders who repeatedly defused Franklin threats were Conner Rash, Michael Hudock , Conner McCarthy and Devon Noble. \nIn addition to scoring the lone goal in the first half, Dobar helped preserve the lead when he cleared a ball off the goal line in the 68 th minute. \nFranklin's absolute last gasp at tying the game came with 51 seconds left when Bieth torpedoed a free kick from 22 yards out that sailed a bit high before banging off the football goal post. \nDuring pre-game player introductions, many of the Patriot players honored or remembered a family member or friend who has been affected by cancer. \newright@hometownlife.com \nFranklin players wore special uniforms during the team's inaugural \"Pink Out\" game.
