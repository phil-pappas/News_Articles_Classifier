I didn’t ask any more questions ... As soon as I heard it was about business, I wasn’t interested any more.” Chris Cairns arrives at Southwark Crown Court to stand trial for perjury. \nPonting and McCullum were at the time playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. The pair were staying in the same hotel on the eve of the inaugural Indian Premier League event.
