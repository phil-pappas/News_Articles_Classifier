The Oilers outscored the Lancers, 4-1, in the frame to open a 10-5 lead. \nBranisavljevic said center Quinten Osborne also played a key role for the Oilers by drawing extra defensive attention that opened Huntington Beach’s outside shooters. \nHannes Daube and Matt Kacura each scored twice for Orange Lutheran. \nIn other games: \nNo. 4 Dana Hills 10, Los Osos of Rancho Cucamonga 9: Junior Jack McLaughlin scored his fifth goal with 19 seconds left to lift the host Dolphins (15-3), ranked second in Division 2, past the No. 6 Grizzlies. \nNo. 7 Newport Harbor 7, No. 8 El Toro 6: Cole Brosnan scored three goals and goalie Joe Ferraro made 12 saves to lead the host Sailors (10-10), who led, 7-3, at halftime. \nNo. 9 Laguna Beach 11, Los Alamitos 6: Jakob Colladay had five goals and six steals and Jeff Rubino added four goals to lead the host Breakers (10-9). \nContact the writer: dalbano@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:57.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
