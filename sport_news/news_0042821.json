That’s our objective.\"\nThe best reinforcement for what the coach is preaching is wins. And the longer it takes this group to get one, the more doubts there will be about whether this team can be competitive this season.\nFalling in an early hole in the standings won’t make assuaging those doubts easier.\n\"You want to win. That’s the business,\" left wing Lee Stempniak said. \"Winning is what matters. At the end of the day, you can play five good games and, if you don’t win, you’re still 0-5, so we have to find a way to win. Nashville is a good team. We played really well Saturday after the game Friday, and for us it’s coming out and backing that up with another good game and that’s the team we want to be. \n\"We don’t want to revert back to what we were doing before, so it’s getting close to not must-win, but we’re getting to the point where we have to start winning. Otherwise, teams start pulling away from you.\"\nWhat was most improved Saturday against the Capitals was the way the Devils’ competed in battles for pucks and the way they pushed back after falling behind, 2-0, to tie the game at 2. Their response wasn’t as good initially after Alex Ovechkin’s spectacular third-period goal snapped that tie and a 3-2 deficit became 5-2, but they did keep pressing until the end.\n\"I think even though that Washington game didn’t come out in our favor and you look at the score and say 5-3, we had some chances at the end that it could have been 5-4 or 5-5 and you take it to OT and you never know what happens,\" right wing Kyle Palmieri said. \"We took some confidence out of that, but it feels better when you get that one in the win column and, hopefully, [tonight] is the night.\"\nBriefs: G Cory Schneider missed practice to be with his wife, Jill, who was due to give birth to the couple’s first child. Hynes was unsure if Schneider will be available to start tonight. … X-rays on D John Moore’s right forearm revealed only a bone bruise after he blocked a third period Ovechkin shot Saturday. … LW Patrik Elias (right knee) has been skating lightly on his own and gradually picking up the intensity of his rehab, but there is still no timetable for his return.\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:36.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
