Dan Campbell run the show for the first time since being named interim head coach. Campbell has been prioritizing intensity in practice and that should carry over to this game. Miami has looked lackadaisical all too often this year, and it could be a reason for its 1-3 start. MMA Fighter Attacks, Threatens Deputies: Police Beyond a lack of intensity, the Dolphins have struggled to produce on both sides of the ball. An inefficient defense has led to an offense that is unable to gain yards when they are needed most. Miami's opponents have been able to dominate time of possession, and also have kept the Dolphins' offense from finding a rhythm. Miami's defense entered the year as one of the league's best, and has since fallen to nearly the bottom. The Dolphins have been unable to see sacks or even many tackles from their biggest names on defense. Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake have no sacks this year after being hyped as a premier duo. Mets Advance to NLCS With 3-2 Win Over Dodgers Ryan Tannehill started the year with no interceptions through two games, but has since thrown five in the last two. The quarterback has been let down by his offensive line, and has been forced into poor passes. Miami can only go as far as its QB can take it, and Tannehill will need to step up in this game against the Titans. Tennessee enters this game with an identical 1-3 record, which means a loss for either team could be difficult to recover from. Miami could go a long way to salvaging its season with a win it needs to have. Sunday's game will begin at 1 p.m. Published 2 hours ago \nNews breaks at inconvenient times.
