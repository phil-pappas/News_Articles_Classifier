(Photo: File photo) \nThe University of South Carolina is moving its football game with LSU to Baton Rouge on Saturday. \nHere is the statement from the University of South Carolina: \nIn light of the tragedy that has beset our community and the ongoing recovery effort, and in consultation with state and local officials, law enforcement, the SEC and LSU, the University of South Carolina will not host the USC v. LSU football game in Columbia this weekend. The game will take place in Baton Rouge. \n“Yesterday, we made the extremely difficult decision to cancel classes for the week due to the stress 34,000 students would place on the region’s recovering infrastructure, there is no doubt 85,000 fans would exact the same toll,” said USC President Harris Pastides. “In the spirit of supporting our South Carolina community that is so supportive of Gamecock Nation, we have decided to move the game to Baton Rouge. The stress on law enforcement and first responders is too great. Moreover, we’ve had many in the Carolina family directly impacted by the flooding.” \nDetails for the game, including kickoff time, are being finalized with officials from LSU and the SEC. AD not 100 percent sure South Carolina will host LSU game \n“On behalf of the University of South Carolina Athletics Department, our thoughts and prayers are with those who have suffered the loss of life and property during this tragic flood,” said Athletics Director Ray Tanner. “After much thought and consideration, and in conjunction with local and state authorities and with our own University administration, we have made the decision to move Saturday’s football game to Baton Rouge. Changing venues on such short notice is no easy task, and I would like to thank LSU President F. King Alexander and Athletics Director Joe Alleva for their cooperation and flexibility in working with us to change the site for Saturday’s football game,” added Tanner. \nPractice will continue and the team is expected to leave for Baton Rouge on Friday. \n“On behalf of the South Carolina football team we want to do the right thing and do what is best for all concerned,” said Gamecock football coach Steve \nSpurrier . “It appears the best thing is to travel to LSU. We look forward to the challenge and competing against the Tigers in Baton Rouge on Saturday.” \nA kickoff time and television coverage have not been determined, but the game will be on Saturday in Baton Rouge. No. 5 LSU (4-0, 2-0 SEC) will now have five SEC home games and three on the road. South Carolina (2-3, 0-3 SEC) will have just three home games and five on the road. The other 12 SEC teams will have four league games at home and four on the road. \nOfficials from LSU and South Carolina as well as the SEC office have not yet said if the gate from the game will be all LSU’s as is the case with usual home games. Nor have officials said if the next LSU-South Carolina game on the books – scheduled for 2020 in Baton Rouge – will be moved to Columbia, South Carolina. 42 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/college/lsu/2015/10/07/lsu-south-carolina-game-moves-baton-rouge/73515272/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:37:40.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
