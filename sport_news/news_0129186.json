After allowing Andy Dalton to drive the Bengals down the field for the game-tying and game-winning drive last week, the Seahawks could not stop Cam Newton from marching the Panthers into the end zone for a comeback win.\nTaking over on his own 20-yard line with 2:20 left on the clock, Newton promptly completed all six of his intended passes (there was an incomplete pass mixed in, but it was a spike to stop the clock) for 89 yards (he took a 9-yard sack at one point as well), each to a different receiver. Newton found, in order, Jonathan Stewart for 8 yards, Ted Ginn for 18, Ed Dickson for 14, rookie Devin Funchess for 16 and Jerricho Cotchery for 7 (on an amazing catch), and then ...\n4th Quarter. Clock winding down. Down by 3. Go for Six. Newton finds Olsen for a PERFECT 26-yard TD. #CARvsSEA http://t.co/9oMUnmihs5 \n— NFL (@NFL) October 18, 2015 That seam route by Olsen is something that gave Seattle trouble last week as well, with Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert catching two scores on similar-looking patterns. As you can see in the aftermath of the video, there's a whole lot of confusion on the back half of that Seattle defense on what appears to be a pretty basic route. That's never good at any time of the game, and it's especially bad when it results in the best receiver on the opposing team winding up wide open in the end zone with the game on the line.\nFor Newton, this drive marked his 10th career fourth-quarter comeback and ninth game-winning drive, per Pro-Football-Reference . For the Panthers under Ron Rivera, it was the continuation of a trend that's been reversing itself over the last few years:\nRon Rivera is now 14-16-1 in games decided by a touchdown or less. That number used to be 2-14.\n— Darin Gantt (@daringantt) October 18, 2015 That's some impressive stuff. Maybe even more impressive? The Panthers are now 5-0 and alone atop the NFC South, having just gone into arguably the toughest environment in the league and come away with a comeback win.\n\nGreg Olsen is wide open.
