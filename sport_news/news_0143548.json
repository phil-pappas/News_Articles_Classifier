Stevens 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 to give the Vikings the win. \n“First we tried to be consistent so we could get a really good lead and once we got the good lead we wanted to play winners,” senior Rampalli said. \nThe team, which has only played one season together, had an interesting style of play. Both girls stood at the baseline. \n“We're both strong baseline players so we felt it was more comfortable to play like that so that we could get a lead on them,” Yadav said. \n“Also, we were able to hit past the volley when we were at the baseline,” Rampalli added. \nFor the third time, East Brunswick's Jennifer Chen won the first singles title. She ousted Rashmi Venkatarama of South Brunswick in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1. \n“In terms of feelings, this is my best match because it feels like my high school career is complete now,” said Chen, a senior. “I had to focus, because I tend to get distracted on the court so I had to tell myself to focus throughout the match and I just stuck to my game plan.” \nDeepti Talesra of J.P. Stevens won at second doubles with an injury that caused her to serve underhand, giving her a slight advantage. She took the match 6-0, 6-4 over East Brunswick's Ananya Prakash. \n“I injured my shoulder during the season so every time I do an overhand serve it hurts a lot,\" Talesra said. “It's been interesting (adjusting) because there's a lot more that you can do with underhand serve than overhand, but at the same time you have to be careful because it's easily destroyed.” \nThird singles went to Jacqueline Quan, also of J.P. Stevens. She disposed of Neeharika Kishore in straight sets, 6-1, 6-3. \n“I just wanted to make sure that I stayed consistent so I wouldn't lose points that were unforced,\" Quan said. \"Basically just try to open up the court since she was good at defending the balls so I just wanted to wait until I had an opportunity. I stayed patient.\" \nFirst doubles was decided in two sets, 6-3, 7-5, with South Brunswick's Prathyusha Pandu and Swathi Chandrika taking the win over Shweta Chandekar and Elizabeth Jackson of East Brunswick. \nConsolation Finals \nSingles: Pauline Kharkover (Old Bridge) d. Claire Pan (J.P. Stevens) 6-4, 6-2; Anisha Malhotra (South Brunswick) won by forfeit over Nicole Azarian (Old Bridge); Sriya Nuguri (East Brunswick) d. Charlotte Park (Monroe) 6-1, 6-4. Doubles: Alyssa Desai and Divya Talesra (J.P. Stevens) d. Nargis Chogle and Tiffany Chi (Edison) 6-3, 6-0; Kayla Kaplan and Shivika Bhatia (East Brunswick) d. Nicolle Kim and Brooke Fabricant (Monroe) 6-4, 6-4. \nStaff Writer Alyssa Davis: adavis3@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RUVA76 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:23:16.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
