Photo taken Monday, August 24, 2015 Kim Brent/The Enterprise Photo: Kim Brent Bruins' Denly dealing with shoulder injury 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nA left shoulder sprain knocked West Brook's starting running back Joel Denly out of Friday's 23-20 loss to La Porte midway through the second quarter. \nThe junior opened the game with a 67-yard touchdown run and collected 98 total rushing yards before a La Porte defender fell on top of Denly out of bounds during a toss play to the right side. \n\"I felt it when he landed down on me,\" Denly said. \"I went to the sideline and coach told me to take a couple plays off and then it really started hurting.\" \nSophomore running back James Jones took over in the backfield for Denly, rushing for 115 yards and a touchdown in his stead. \n\"He (Jones) stepped up big for us,\" Denly said. \"He played really well and served his purpose.\" \nDenly had his shoulder checked out Saturday morning and doctors said with proper rehab, he'll be back in the lineup this Friday, when the Bruins' host Port Arthur Memorial in their final regular season contest. \n\"I'll be out there next week,\" said Denly, who has rushed for a team-high 1,198 yards and 16 touchdowns this season. \"It's the swelling that I'm dealing with mostly right now.\" \nWest Brook (6-3, 3-2) can clinch their ninth postseason appearance in 10 years with a win over Memorial (2-6, 1-3). \nBridge City knocks off Huffman \nThe Cardinals (6-2, 3-1) kept their district title hopes intact, holding on for a 41-34 win over Huffman-Hargrave Friday. \nThe win moves Bridge City into a three-way tie for second place in District 10-4A-I with Huffman and Silsbee, who will travel to Larry Ward Stadium this Friday. Jasper remains in first place with a 4-0 district record with a 34-14 win over Little Cypress-Mauriceville. \n\"Silsbee is a quality ball club and there will be a lot of talent on both sides of the ball,\" said Bridge City coach Dwayne DuBois. \"It should be a fun game for our fans and this community.\" \nBehind Cayce Draper's two touchdowns and 204 rushing yards, the Cardinals erased a 20-13 halftime deficit with a 28-point spurt in the second half. Bridge City built a 41-27 lead in the fourth quarter and held on for a seven-point win. \nDraper moved his season rushing total to 1,133 and 11 touchdowns. Hunton Denton added 100 yards rushing on four carries, including a 70-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. Quarterback Camden DuBois completed his lone touchdown of the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass to Austin Fritz in the second quarter. \n\"Cayce is a prototypical fullback for this offense,\" DuBois said. \"He's a heck of a football player who loves playing the game. A hard-nosed tough kid and that's what you need. He gets stronger as the game goes along.\" \nDuBois also credits Denton for a gritty performance after missing two games due to a shoulder sprain suffered against Cleveland on Sept. 25. \n\"He's just now starting to get healthy and he's a really explosive option for our offense,\" DuBois said. \nWoodville beats Kountze, closing in on postseason \nA 43-41 win over Kountze has put Woodville and second-year coach Michael Waldie one win away from the school's first playoff appearance since 2011. \nBacked by 349 rushing yards that included a 223-yard performance from Ivan Lockhart , the Eagles (6-2, 3-2) outlasted Grayland Arnold and the Lions' to equal their win total from the 2014 season. \nDavid Whitehead - who finished 3-of-3 passing for 39 yards and a touchdown - added 61 yards and a touchdown on the ground while Zackary Martin scored twice on 19 carries for 65 yards. \nWoodville will travel to East Chambers this Friday to take on the first place Buccaneers and finish the season at home against cellar-dweller Warren on Nov. 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:25:31.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
