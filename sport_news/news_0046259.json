After Yost's score put the Bearcats in front, 21-7, Randy Schmidt tossed a 68-yard reverse pass to Sehl to make it a 28-7 Bearcat lead with 7:21 to play in the first half.\nThomas LePage, making his first career start for an injured Pitt State starter John Roderique, Jr., completed 13 of 27 passes for 76 yards. He tossed a 15-yard touchdown pass to running back Michael Rose to draw the Gorillas within 14 points, at 28-14, with 6:45 to play in the third quarter.\nThe Pitt State defense limited the Bearcats to 121 yards in the second half.
