Afterward, Bobo said he’d have to review video Sunday and meet with his coaching staff before determining who would begin this week as the starter. \nColorado State University finished with 151 passing yards and a season-low 256 yards of total offense. \n“You’d like for everything to be going smoothly at all positions, but it’s not,” Bobo said. “And sometimes when the quarterback position is a little bit unsettling, that’s what we all want to talk about. But there’s a lot more issues than just the quarterback.” \nStevens, a sophomore who has started every game this season for the Rams, was pulled Saturday after just two offensive series and replaced by Key. The redshirt freshman led a 16-play, 75-yard scoring drive on his second series, throwing his only pass at the end for a 13-yard touchdown to Joe Hansley. \nKey completed just 5 of 19 passes for 56 yards and was intercepted twice in his most extensive action of the season. Bobo said he stayed with Key “because of the momentum, not necessarily what he was doing.” \nStevens returned in the fourth quarter and completed eight of his last nine passes for 60 yards, with no interceptions and no touchdowns. He was 8 of 10 for the game and was sacked three times. \n“The whole position’s got to play a little bit better,” Bobo said, noting that the Rams have gone up against some pretty good defensive teams in Utah State, Boise State and Minnesota. \nStevens has completed 98 of 171 passes for 1,190 yards and 10 touchdowns so far this season, with five interceptions. His pass-efficiency rating is 129.20. \nKey is 21 of 42 for 251 yards and three touchdowns with three interceptions. His rating is 109.49. \nNeither quarterback has shown he’s good enough to warrant shelving the other for the remainder of the season. So both will continue to play, Bobo said. \n“We’ve played some talented defensive football teams, and a first-year starter, with a new system, there’s growing pains,” Bobo said. “There’s more growing pains than I would like and I’m sure our fan base would like, but that’s part of it. \n“We’ll get it right, and we’ll have consistent quarterback play; I guarantee you that.” \nTHIS WEEK’S THEME: The quarterback decision fit neatly into what seems to be the Rams’ theme this week: “Stay the course.” \nBobo, linebacker Kevin Davis and tight end Kivon Cartwright all repeated the phrase Monday when asked what the Rams need to do to get out of a tailspin of five losses in the past six games. \n“At times like this, you question a lot of things,” Bobo said. “But to me, you’ve got to get back to fundamentals. You’ve got to stay the course in what you believe in, keep coaching. \n“If you basically tear everything down and say this isn’t working, then you’re losing your confidence in your players. You’ve got to stick to what you believe in, you’ve got to stay positive, you’ve got to still press and push them and demand of them. But you’ve got to accentuate the positives and show these are the reasons why these things are happening, and you’ve got to continue to coach and lay that foundation. \n“And at some point, if you keep doing what you believe in over and over, it will turn.” \nINJURY UPDATE: Sophomore linebacker Kiel Robinson injured his left shoulder in Saturday’s game against Boise State and left the field wearing a sling. Bobo said he doesn’t yet know what his status is for this week’s game. \nSenior safety Trent Matthews left the early with a hamstring injury that has bothered him throughout the season. He was expected to practice Monday and should be fine, the coach said. \nFollow reporter Kelly Lyell at twitter.com/KellyLyell and facebook.com/KellyLyell.news. \n•Next up: Air Force at CSU, 1:30 p.m. Saturday, Hughes Stadium \n•Watch: CBSSN \n•Listen: ESPN (FM 105.5), KKFN (FM 104.3) \n•Live chat: Join Kelly Lyell and Matt L.
