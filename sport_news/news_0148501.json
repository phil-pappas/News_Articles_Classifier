They never stopped giving me everything they had.” \nInside the Yankees’ clubhouse, Chase Headley sat quietly and stared directly into his locker. And when Headley finally rose, Brian McCann patted his shoulder and offered a word of encouragement. \n“It’s tough,” McCann said. “We didn’t reach our goal, but it’s not for lack of effort or trying.” \nThe Stadium scene was electric early as Tino Martinez threw out the first pitch. Joe Torre was in the building, playoff baseball was back in the Bronx after a two-year absence and Tanaka dialed up two strikeouts with his signature splitter in a quick first inning. \nBut Rasmus rocked the first pitch of the second inning well over the right field fence. \nComing back from a ribcage muscle strain, Gomez led off the fourth with a long, first-pitch homer to left and Keuchel might well have had a 22-0 lead. \n“We just didn’t solve Keuchel _ the whole year,” Girardi said. “We struggled against lefties down the stretch and that continued again tonight.” \nBuilding on the success he’s had all year, the lefty used movement and change of speed on his four-pitch arsenal to limit the Yanks to just three singles and a walk with seven strikeouts. \nThe Yanks’ only real spark came after Carlos Beltran singled in the sixth, putting runners at first and second with two out for Alex Rodriguez. \nProtecting a 2-0 lead, Keuchel got A-Rod to fly out easily on the first pitch. \n“That was basically the whole (threat) we put together,” said Beltran. \nAfter that, the Yanks went down quietly against lefty reliever Tony Sipp and closer Luke Gregerson. \nTanaka lasted only five innings, yielding two runs on four hits with three walks and three strikeouts. \nLefty Justin Wilson recorded four outs in relief of Tanaka, but a tiring Dellin Betances yielded Jose Altuve’s RBI single in the seventh. \nBy the eighth inning, the crowd booed Brett Gardner (0-for-4, three strikeouts) and they were indifferent to pinch-hitter Jacoby Ellsbury; the leadoff man with the $153 million contract was benched by Girardi to get Chris Young (0-for-2, walk) into the lineup. \n“We felt we had to get Young’s bat in there,” Girardi said of the right-handed hitter who batted .327 against lefty pitching this year and was 6-for-20 against Keuchel. \nIn the end, nothing worked. \n“We overcame a lot of adversity and played better than expected,” Gardner said. “But the way the season ended is a tough pill to swallow.” \nBut the Yanks could see this coming, having averaged just three runs over their last 12 regular-season games while losing eight of them. \nA club that led the AL East by 7{ games in late July was overtaken by the surging Toronto Blue Jays, and the mid-August loss of Mark Teixeira (fractured leg) impacted the lineup. \nBefore the Astros took a celebratory team photo on the Stadium mound, spilling beer and champagne on the dirt and grass, Girardi spoke for his disappointed club. \n“This hurts,” Girardi said. But, “I’m extremely proud of that group in there.” Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers. In no way do they represent the view of Stephens Media LLC or this newspaper.
