Katie Kania made 12 kills, seven digs, two blocks and an ace. Catherine Clark contributed 13 digs and three aces, while Becca Camacho netted 10 kills, three, digs two assists and a block. \n“I love this team,” Kania said. \n“Everyone is super-positive and we all get along well. Everyone contributes a ton and it makes the team better.” \nFirst-year coach Beth Schaible works on a day-by-day basis with a near-equal equal mix of newcomers (five) and veterans (four). \nThe Trailblazers play their home matches at the Xcel Sportsplex in Henderson County. \nKania, Downer and Anna Hutchinson are the only three seniors on the team's roster. Downer and Kania are captains. \n\"This is one of the best years we've ever had, and getting to do it as a senior makes it even better,\" said Downer, who is a setter. \n\"We've had a lot of great moments, on and off the court.\" \nKania has amassed a team-high 319 kills. Camacho (170) and Johanna Goodrich (134) are other main attackers. Downer has dished out 675 of the team's 717 assists. Downer (353), Kania (348), Clark (250), Anna Hutchinson (120) and Bayli Bayne (119) are digs leaders. \n\"This is definitely the best team I've ever coached. There are no weak spots,\" Schaible said. \n\"They are solid as players and teammates.\" \nThe NCHEAC volleyball tournament is Oct. 22-25 and will coincide with the state association's soccer tourrnament, also in the Asheville area. \n\"Normally we have to drive three to four hours for a state tournament,\" Kania said. \n\"This is going to be great. (Xcel) is where we have our home matches and hopefully there will be a lot of fans don't usually get at state tournaments.\" \n- Follow the HS Huddle on Facebook www.facebook.com/hshuddle or Twitter: www.twitter.com/acthshuddle Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1RFuPDE Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:37:00.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
