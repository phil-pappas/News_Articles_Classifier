(AP Photo/David J. Phillip) \nThe latest on the League Championship Series. The Royals and Blue Jays play Game 3 of the ALCS in Toronto on Monday night. The Mets and Cubs play Game 3 of the NLCS in Chicago on Tuesday night. Here's a look at what's happening (all times EDT): \n4:20 p.m. \nAbout an hour before batting practice starts ahead of Game 3 of the ALCS, Blue Jays relievers Roberto Osuna and Ryan Tepera were out on the field warming up â€” by playing soccer. The pair kicked an orange ball around in the outfield, then set up a goal. The goalie: a life-sized cutout of a left-handed batter. \nSoccer has been a part of the team's pregame routine all season. Catcher Russell Martin got it kicked off. \n3:47 p.m. \nHours before they hosted Game 3 of the ALCS against the Royals, the Blue Jays were busy. Toronto claimed switch-pitcher Pat Venditte off waivers from the Oakland Athletics and designated for assignment infielder Darwin Barney. Barney was not on the postseason roster. \nThe 30-year-old Venditte made his major league debut this season. He was 2-2 with a 4.40 ERA in 26 relief appearances for the A's. \n2:05 p.m. \nThe Chicago Cubs have started their workout at Wrigley Field on the off day before Game 3 of the NL Championship Series. \nIt is a sunny, windy day in Chicago, and the Cubs are hoping a change of scenery will help them get back in the series against the surging Mets. New York got another homer from Daniel Murphy in a 4-1 victory over Chicago on Sunday night and is just two wins away from a trip to the World Series. \nKyle Hendricks faces Mets right-hander Jacob deGrom on Tuesday night in the first NLCS game at Wrigley since 2003. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:28:07.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
