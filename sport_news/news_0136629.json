The losing streak was a big factor. \n“We saw some heads go down, but we managed to pick them back up.” \nCristian Ruelas took the corner kick in the 104th minute, and Hill knew where he was going with the ball. \nHere is what sweet relief sounds like for the Vulcans: “I knew he likes to whip it first post. Figured I’d go first post, and once he saw me go he made the effort to whip it there,” Hill said. \nUH-Hilo (2-9, 1-5 Pacific West Conference) might not have survived the first overtime if Hill hadn’t have dove to deflect a shot in the box from the Seasiders (4-7, 2-4). \n“I was just playing the ball,” Hill said. \nAll too often, Thompson saw his team miss on key chances during the losing streak. \n“It was exasperating because we worked so hard,” he said. “The probability of continuing to miss big chances wasn’t good.” \nGoalkeeper Cassidy Dixon, a Honokaa High graduate, finished with 10 saves. \nEarlier, the Lady Vulcans were shut out 2-0 by the Seasiders (3-6-2, 2-3-1), who got goals from Kate Orchard in the 22nd minute and Rebekah McCarthy in the 43rd. \nLooking to get off to a fast start, UH-Hilo (3-4-3, 2-4) lost its third in a row, taking only five shots and finishing with zero corner kicks. \n“Disappointed with the lack of energy,” Thompson said. “We were down a little bit but if we come out with more energy that will fix that.” \nThe Vulcans host Dominican on Saturday. The women’s game is at 12:30 p.m. and the men follow at 3 p.m. Search Site", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:24:42.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
