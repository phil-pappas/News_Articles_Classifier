Mark Streit scored the goal for the Flyers, who lost their second straight. \nThe 43-year-old Jagr is the NHL's all-time leader in opening day points with 39 on 13 goals and 26 assists. \nLeading 4-0, his goal from the slot 33 seconds into the second period put the Panthers ahead 5-0. His second came 41 seconds into the third when he tipped in a rebound to make the score 6-1. Jagr now has 724 career goals, only seven away from tying Marcel Dionne (731) for fourth all-time. \nSmith's second goal came during a 5-on-3 power play at 7:55 of the third to make it 7-1. \nThe Panthers took a 1-0 lead on Trocheck's goal 1:23 in. Jokinen shot from center ice and Mason blocked it, but Trocheck grabbed the rebound and poked it in. \nFlorida scored two power-play goals in 51 seconds to make the score 3-0. Bjugstad's shot from the left circle got past Mason's glove at 4:55 and Smith scored from in front at 5:46. \nA gaffe by Mason led to the Panthers fourth goal. The goalie attempted to clear the puck from behind the net but it went right to Trocheck in the right circle. Trocheck's shot was blocked, but Jokinen tipped in the rebound to make the score 4-0, chasing Mason. \nNotes: Luongo is 4-1-0 in his last five games against Philadelphia. Luongo took a stick to the head late in the third period from teammate Willie Mitchell, but stayed in the game ...
