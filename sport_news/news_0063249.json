Their hard work had paid off in a convincing win in the rain, something Runnin’ Bulldogs hadn’t been able to enjoy when facing the Flames since 2006. “The last time we beat them I was in the sixth grade,” GWU senior defensive back Jonathan Sherrill said. “Early this year we have struggled but this was a big win. We’re going to enjoy this but then we’re going to make corrections and move on.” It took execution on both sides of the line of scrimmage to topple the Flames. The GWU defense kept turning Liberty away as the visitors rallied from a 20-0 deficit to draw within seven points with two minutes left in the third period. Offensively, GWU – which had posted a high game of 23 points in the season opener at South Alabama – came out and scored all its points in the first half against Liberty. The ‘Dogs rolled up 269 yards rushing against a Flames’ defense that ranked 8th in the nation in rushing defense with quarterback Tyrell Maxwell doing damage with 173 yards and three touchdowns. “I believe in my O-line,” said Maxwell, a sophomore starting only his fourth game at the collegiate level. “They put me in position to do things. I just believe in my guys.” Gardner-Webb got an inside-outside combo going with its option, with Maxwell’s runs on the corner mixed in with quick handoffs to freshman Jonathan Blackmon and senior Bobby Clark. Maxwell also threw for 105 yards in the game. “We really respected their pass rush, their All-American No. 52 (Chima Uzowihe) can really get to the quarterback,” GWU head coach Carroll McCray said. “We wanted Tyrell to run it so they (defense) wouldn’t know whether he was keeping it or going to throw. I think our coaches had a good game plan and our guys took it to heart.” Liberty though got a 307-yard passing night from quarterback Josh Woodrum as the Flames entered comeback mode after GWU built its first-half edge. That put the pressure squarely on the ‘Dogs’ defenders. “They started going to their passing game but we knew we had to keep fighting and fight til the end,” GWU junior linebacker Chad Geter said. “We always go into a game wanting to shut down the running game first and we knew what they (Liberty) was capable of. We knew we just had to play good solid defense.” Page 2 of 2 - GWU got an interception from Sherrill to stop one drive, O.J. Mau blocked a field goal, and the ‘Dogs forced Liberty to settle for two other field-goal tries that sailed wide. Geter had 11 tackles on the night, including a sack and three stops for lost yardage. Besides the interception, Sherrill had seven tackles, including two for lost yardage.
