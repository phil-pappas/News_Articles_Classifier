He played one snap in December in a loss to Seattle. With Tiller active, rookie guard Ian Silberman is inactive for the first time this season and guard Brandon Thomas will make his debut on the 46-man roster.\nThe 49ers did not announce any changes to their starting offensive line.\nSilberman became the backup center when the 49ers traded rookie Nick Easton this week in a trade with the Vikings for inside linebacker Gerald Hodges . Right guard Jordan Devey would presumably play center if starter Marcus Martin is sidelined tonight.\nMeanwhile, left tackle Joe Staley (knee), who was questionable, will make his 69th straight start. Staley missed two days of practice and was limited on Friday. He declined to discuss his injury after Friday’s session.\nWide receiver Quinton Patton (concussion) is also active. As expected, outside linebacker Ahmad Brooks won’t play tonight following the recent death of his sister. Brooks is not with the team. He will be replaced in the starting lineup by Corey Lemonier .\nTight end Vernon Davis was ruled out Friday and will his miss his second straight game with a knee injury. In last week’s 17-3 loss to the Packers, Garrett Celek played 47 snaps, Vance McDonald played 20 and rookie Blake Bell played nine. McDonald will replace Davis in the starting lineup.\nThe 49ers’ other inactives are: Hodges, WR DeAndrew White, RB Mike Davis and NT Mike Purcell .\nTwitter: @Eric_Branch", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:03:32.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
