Yards, in bunches. Touchdown passes. Lengthy touchdown passes. Career-highs shattered at every turn.\nAnd yet, when it was all over, the 18th-ranked University of Memphis football team felt there was room for improvement.\n“We played good,” Doroland Dorceus said, “but we didn’t play to our full potential.”\nThat is where unbeaten Memphis now finds itself. After racing to a 66-42 victory over Tulsa, pushing its program-best winning streak to 14 games and setting a new program record with 704 yards of offense, there was a sense of disappointment at the end of this crisp, clear night at H.A. Chapman Stadium. There was a lingering feeling that more could have been done.\n“I’m happy that we found a way to win the game, but we did a lot of bad things out there,” Memphis coach Justin Fuente said. “We made a lot of mistakes. We played a little bit like a team that was still getting over the previous week -- physically, mentally, emotionally or whatever it was.”\nThe previous week, of course, featured a monumental win over then-No. 13 Ole Miss, the Tigers’ first victory over a ranked opponent since 1996. A sellout crowd was on hand at the Liberty Bowl, and large swaths of that crowd spilled onto the field in celebration after the game.\nThat game was a milestone of sorts for the Memphis football program, but it was also physically and emotionally draining. Fuente said Friday night that five starters did not practice this week because of injury. Players felt they were able to turn the page and renew their focus, but mistakes popped up across the board against the Golden Hurricane.\nFor starters, Memphis committed 12 penalties for 120 yards.\n“I didn’t think we were very consistent offensively,” Fuente said. “I know we ran the ball and threw the ball for some yards and scored points, but we were just hit and miss. Defensively, and as a team, we took far too many penalties. I felt like we were in control of the line of scrimmage, defensively, but couldn’t, for lack of a better term, get out of own way at times. We found ways to kind of mess it up.”\nThere were plenty of bright spots, however -- 704 offensive yards would be one. Redshirt junior quarterback Paxton Lynch accounted for most of them. He completed 32 of 44 passes for a career-high 447 yards and accounted for five touchdowns, four in the air and one on the ground. And he wasn’t the only one who enjoyed a career night.\nDorceus finished with 32 carries for a career-high 138 yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Mose Frazier had 10 catches for a career-best 128 yards. And freshman running back Jamarius Henderson, who entered Friday’s game with one carry in the Tigers’ previous four contests, finished with a career-high 112 rushing yards and two scores.\nAdd Anthony Miller (five catches, 106 yards) and Tevin Jones (four catches, 77 yards) to the list and, well, you get the idea.\n“We practice very hard during the week,” Frazier said. “So come game time, it comes easy to us. We have a great quarterback. We have great running backs. We have a lot of good receivers and we can get open.”\nMeanwhile, Tulsa put up 534 offensive yards of its own. The incredible numbers made sense. It was the kind of track meet befitting a matchup between the No. 10 and No. 6 offenses in the Football Bowl Subdivision.\nAll night, the points and yards came in spurts. Memphis struck first, as Lynch found Jones running free along the sideline and hit him in stride for a 58-yard touchdown pass. Then it was Tulsa’s turn, with Keyarris Garrett collecting a pass and jogging into the end zone for a 36-yard catch. Then Lynch threw a towering 45-yard scoring pass to Miller. Then Tulsa’s Ramadi Warren, a Whitehaven product, ran it in from five yards.\nIt went on like this for four quarters, a pair of high-powered offenses trading scores every few minutes, until Memphis began to pull away late in the second quarter, and then again late in the game. Tulsa quarterback Dane Evans completed a Hail Mary, that was tipped in the air, for a touchdown at the end of the half. Then he threw for a pair of touchdowns in the third quarter, including one from 80 yards. His favorite target was Garrett, a senior wideout who finished with 14 catches for 268 yards and three touchdowns.\nAfter Evans’ last touchdown pass of the night, Memphis answered with 17 unanswered points. Then Tulsa scored. Then Henderson scored. Then they all walked off the field and gawked at the box score.\nWell, some of them gawked.\n“We left a lot of points out there, a lot of yards out there,” Dorceus said. “We could’ve done a lot more than we did today.”\nAnd that’s where the Memphis team now finds itself, 704 yards and 66 points behind it, but improvement -- constant, relentless improvement -- always at the forefront of its mind.\nNOTES: Freshman wide receiver Jae'Lon Oglesby did not travel with the team to Tulsa. Fuente said he did not meet expectations in practice this week and clarified that it was not an off-field issue. ... Running back Jarvis Cooper traveled with the team but did not play Friday. Fuente said the sophomore wanted to play but was held out as a precaution. The coach expects Cooper, who did not practice last week, to return against Tulane on Oct. 31. ... Another one of the team's primary ball-carriers, Sam Craft, only received one carry Friday. Fuente said he was limited in practice this week but is expected to play next week.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4nuCp2gA2w", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*132/1024_MASP_umfb13.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/spacer.gif"], "published": "2015-10-24T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:42:18.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
