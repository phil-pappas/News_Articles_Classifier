Mifflin. \nSHILLINGTON -- Comebacks are never easy, particularly in an opponent's gym \nGarden Spot's volleyball team fashioned a pair of comebacks at Governor Mifflin Wednesday. \nThe Spartans came back from down eight points midway through the fourth set to win it, tying the match with the Mustangs at 2-2. \nThat fourth-set comeback completed a reversal that saw the Spartans road back from a 2-0 deficit in sets. \nWhile Spot forced a fifth and deciding set, it ran out of comebacks and the Mustangs won it 15-4 to take the nonleague match, 3-2. \nThe match was a battle of unbeaten teams, both coming in at 13-0, not counting tournament matches. Both are also among the top 10 in the latest Pennsylvania Volleyball Coaches Association Class AAA poll, Garden Spot at No. 9 and Mifflin at No. 10. \nWednesday's battle came a night after two other heavyweights met in Landisville. Hempfield, the No. 2 team in the most recent PVCA AAA poll, fell to Bishop Shanahan, the No. 3 team in the poll, 3-1. \nThose two teams have battled three times this season with Shanahan holding a 2-1 edge. \nServing is the key: On Wednesday night, it was Mifflin's serving that was the difference in the three sets it won. The Mustangs kept the Spartans off balance, varying speeds and location, disrupting the all-important first pass. \n\"They out-served us, that was the biggest factor,'' said Garden Spot coach Denny Werner. \"They served us out of system. We had seen serving like that this year but tonight we were in a funk.'' \nThe Spartans, who entered the match as the top AAA team in the district power rankings, started their comeback in the fourth set after being down 16-8. Spot's Alexis Horst called for a set and put it away to slice the Mifflin lead to two, 21-19. Two points later, it was tied 21-21. \nSpot setter Sydney Nichols scored the winning point in the set when she dumped a pass over the net instead of setting the ball. \nAny momentum from that play, however, didn't carry over into the fifth set. \n\"We stopped believing after the second set but started again in the fifth,'' said Mifflin coach Josh Radwanski. \"We put our foot back on the gas pedal and executed all aspects.'' \nTurning point: Rachel Johnson's serves in the fifth set. She had a pair of aces in a 10-point Mifflin spurt with her on the serving line. In that time, the Mustangs took a 3-2 lead and when she was done, they led 12-3. \nStar of the game: Gabrielle Johnson had 24 kills and two blocks for Mifflin. Not far behind was Garden Spot's Caroline Beohm, who had 15 kills, 23 digs and three aces. \nQuotable: Werner, on the comeback from a two-set deficit: \"We just didn't make as many errors and we passed much better.'' \nUp next: Garden Spot, which has already clinched an L-L League playoff berth, can finish no worse than a tie for first place with a win at Lampeter-Strasburg Monday. Gov. Mifflin plays at Conrad Weiser tonight. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:21:07.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
