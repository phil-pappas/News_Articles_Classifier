The other two have work ethics beyond reproach as well. \nKorbas was late to practice Monday and missed a photo shoot with the News Journal, but she had an excellent excuse. She was working on a school honors project. Korbas, a sophomore, hopes to own a college associates degree by the time she finishes high school. Buy Photo \nClaire Korbas (Photo: News Journal) \n\"She's a genius,\" Jones said. \"I'm not sure abnormal is the right word, but she came out to the course in her eighth grade year and I said, 'Dad, there's a girl out here.' And she was there the next day and the next day ... I don't know if it was inborn, but she developed a different work ethic than a normal freshman. She'd ask my dad for help and put in the hours after practice.\" \nAnybody that knows Jones would say she was describing her own approach to golf. At this point Shelby girls coach Brad Ruminski — the pro at Shelby C.C. — knows to leave well enough alone with both of his players. \n\"I'm letting them do their thing,\" Ruminski said. \"Any tweaking will be on a need-be basis. I'm letting them get their practice in and they're both focusing on their short game, which is key for (long-hitter) Alexis. Claire's got to keep her drives going. She's driving it exceptionally well the last couple of times out, and she needs to take care of pitching and putting as well.\" \nJones and Korbas will be playing on Ohio State's Gray Course while Kehres will tee off at the North Star Resort, about 15 minutes north of Columbus. Kehres already got a taste of pressure last week when he won a three-hole playoff for district medalist runner-up honors after shooting a 76 in regulation. Buy Photo \nBrock Kehres (Photo: Mitchell Pe Masilun/News Journal) \n\"I was excited about (the playoff),\" he said. \"I played in one this summer and won it, but another time they just let a scorecard playoff decide it. At districts we were asked how we wanted to do it. The manager said he never had two guys tie for second, and he didn't know the procedure, so we decided to keep playing. I'm glad because you've got to learn how to handle the pressure.\" \nKehres has broken 80 in his last four rounds, firing a 74 for runner-up honors in the Northern Ohio League Tournament, 79 at the Edison Invitational, 79 under extremely tough conditions as sectional champ and then the 76 last week at Red Hawk Run in Findlay. \n\"Toward the end of the season I had a match against Norwalk where I shot 37 or 38 and after that I kept going; my confidence started building up,\" said the Shelby junior, whose play over the last month has lowered his season average to 81. \"I told myself to go in with no expectations this season, but my goal was to make it to state. Obviously, I'd like to win, but top 12 would be pretty good because that means you're All-Ohio. \n\"The pressure's going to be there, but I've got to act like I don't feel it.\" \nOff the course, Jones and Korbas have different ways of preparing for state. Jones, a sectional and district champ, didn't look to see who else is in the field or what they shot at districts.

The biggest thing is to be confident because I made it here. I worked to get here. It's great teeing off with seniors because they'll know what's up.\" \nShelby sophomore Claire Korbas works on her putting. (Photo: Submitted) \nJones definitely knows what's up. She came within a stroke of winning state last year, finishing one stroke behind 2011 state champ Haylee Harford of Leavittsburg LaBrae and two strokes ahead of 2013 state champ Makayla Dull of Kansas Lakota. They were both seniors. \n\"She's like a mentor to me,\" Korbas said. \"If I need anything, she can explain it. She's super-educated about golf and she's taught me a lot and told me a lot about the Gray course. I've researched it and looked at scorecards, but it's not the same as playing it.\" \nKehres feels a big key to his stretch run has been buying what first-year coach and Shelby alum Justin Schroeder has been selling.

(Photo: Mitchell Pe Masilun/News Journal) \n\"The mental aspect with him is so much different than my first two years,\" Kehres said. \"He's always preaching not to let one bad hole ruin your round, always think about the positive and always pick out a good target. If you hit your target, regardless of the results, think positive because you hit it right where you wanted.\" \nSchroeder, who played for small college power Ohio Wesleyan, said the mental part of his own game was always strong, crediting his high school coach, Pat Lewis, and his college coaches. \n\"Brock's score was better at district, but I think his round was better at sectionals because of the awful conditions,\" Schroeder said. \"He focused on what he could control. You eliminate half the field that is complaining about the wind and weather. Brock did a good job of controlling his emotions.\" \nJones doesn't remember leaving herself with anything but long putts once she reached the greens the second day of last year's state tournament. So she's placed extra emphasis on her pitching chipping. \n\"The last three days I hit nothing but 40-yard shots so I'll be confident and execute; there's five par 3s on this course,\" she said. \"I'm also referring back to my notes, where I missed last year, where I have to be deadly.\" \nA foul-weather fan because she feels it give her a mental edge over fair-weather competitors, Jones hopes Friday's weather forecast holds up. \n\"It's suppose to rain, so I'm excited,\" she said, smiling. \"Calm, but excited.\" 9 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1RDt9KN More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:27:58.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
