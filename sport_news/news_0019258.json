The dog was in the water for only a few minutes, when an alligator shot up, attacking Sazerac.\n“Just out of nowhere, in front of this water hyacinth, this thing just exploded out right at her. It was like a national geographic film,” Freeman said.\nSazerac was able to pivot away from the reptile’s jaws, as Freeman contemplated taking the monster on himself.\n“I realized that it was way bigger than anything I could take on, the best I had was to throw my hat at it and scream,” Freeman said.\nThe gator gladly gulped the Boston Red Sox lid and darted back into the swamp, leaving Freeman speechless.\nFreeman took it upon himself to make signs warning people about an aggressive gator in the park, but a few of his signs were already removed within days. City Park says the area where the gator was spotted is considered a natural habitat, and they’d like to keep it that way.\n“By and large, we've found that we can coexist in the park although we are quite proactive in removing large alligators North of I-610 and any and all alligators South of I-610,” John Hopper, the spokesperson for City Park, said.\nAfter our interview, Hopper assured us they would contact Wildlife and Fisheries to remove the gator that attacked Sazerac, but he offered some advice for people who let their dogs roam the water on their own.\n“If you put your dog on a leash when you have them in New Orleans Park, which is in accordance with city law and ordinances, you have mitigated 99 percent of the problem,” Hopper said.\nTell that to Sazerac, who won’t be going near the water anytime soon, even if the gator is removed.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
