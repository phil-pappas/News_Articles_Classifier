Like all the rest, this latest visitor brought something other than answers.\n\"More dog food,\" Dickens said, peeking through the blanket that served as blinds. \"And trash bags.\"\nBullet, his mother's service dog, had been in the classroom when a gunman killed Moore and eight others. After the killings, people wanted to help, so Dickens told them to bring Purina. Now the Husky trailed Dickens through the apartment, back to the dark bedroom where Moore used to sleep. Dickens tossed the trash bags and the dog food onto his mother's bed. He already had plenty of both.\nThe gunshots that echoed through Snyder Hall on Oct. 1 turned Roseburg, briefly, into international news, the latest epicenter in debates over gun control, mental health care and campus security. News reports called the dead \"The Umpqua Nine.\" That meant nine funerals, nine families with nothing but memories left.\nThirty miles from Roseburg, marooned in Myrtle Creek, Dickens barely had those. The scrawny 22-year-old had waited his whole life to live with his mother. They had reunited only six months before. Now all he had left was her stuff, towers of treasures she'd packed away for safe-keeping, movies about horses mixed with the glass art she used to paint.\nHe snaked back through the boxes to the living room, collapsed on a loveseat and leaned his head against the detritus of her life. His mother's fianc√©, laying on the couch a few feet away, sat up.\n\"Take it day by day,\" Travis Dow told him.\nDickens closed his eyes and groaned.\n\"I'm taking it second by second.\"\n***\nDickens always told people he was wrongly taken from Moore when he was 5 because she didn't have the money to raise him and two younger brothers. The truth was he knew very little about his mother's life and the reasons she lost custody.\nWhile he was in Louisiana foster homes, picking up a bayou Cajun accent, his mother bounced between Nevada, California and Oregon. As a kid, Moore dreamed of joining the Navy, according to brother Rick Goin, but chronic nerve and muscle issues prevented it. She didn't work much, Goin said, but she had an optimistic streak that led her to marry four times and talk \"constantly\" of starting a new life with Dickens.\nMoore started calling Dickens once a month when he was in grade school, said Jill Hadley, the foster mother Dickens lived with from the time he was 11. As he grew older, they talked almost every week about school and religion. She was a committed Seventh Day Adventist, he a Southern Baptist.\nFour years ago, Moore began turning her aimless life toward something. She moved to Myrtle Creek and insisted on a long engagement when she met Dow through an online dating service.\nMoore suffered from sciatica so severe she eventually used a wheelchair and struggled with undiagnosed cognitive disabilities, she told Dickens, but she still had dreams: She'd start college, then bring Dickens home to live with her and Dow, who moved from McMinnville a few years ago to be with her.\nIn March, she called to say she had cobbled together the $298 to buy him a one-way bus ticket from New Orleans to Roseburg. She met him at the station, then a friend drove them the 30 minutes south to Myrtle Creek.\nCasey Parks | The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\"Good afternoon facebookies,\" Dickens wrote online when he arrived. \"I feel good because I could actually spend time with my biological family now. I am officially in Myrtle Creek, Oregon, and will be here for some time.\"\nMoore updated her Facebook page that day, too: \"Never will quit smiling now that Walter is home.\"\nDickens tried finding work as a dishwasher in Myrtle Creek, but the timber town had only four restaurants. He spent most of his time with Dow, who suffered a heart attack last year and spent most days on the couch. They didn't look like family -- Dickens is tall and thin with hair that juts in every direction, Dow short and round with a neatly trimmed beard -- but they bonded quickly.\nThe bus between Myrtle Creek and Roseburg ran only every few hours, but Moore called between classes to check on her two men. At night, the three of them watched westerns and talked about the future. She wanted to open a ranch for handicapped kids. Dickens wanted to publish a book of his poems about love and God.\nHe was still asleep when a fellow classmate stormed his mom's \"Introduction to Expository Writing\" class with a gun on the morning of Oct 1. He took the bus to the Douglas County Fairgrounds, where hundreds of students and families were reunited by police and Red Cross teams.\nShe never showed up. As night fell, Dickens went into his new bedroom and closed the door, praying to himself that she would call soon.\nAt 9:30 p.m., Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents knocked on the apartment door. They said they had bad news.\n***\nTen days later, every rap on the door was a reminder -- of going to the morgue to confirm the body was hers, of catching a ride to Roseburg to meet President Barack Obama , of coming home to see her urn on the kitchen table and her wheelchair folded in a corner. Her belongings filled the apartment, yet it suddenly felt empty.\nWell-meaning strangers brought 15 bags of dog food and hundreds of black trash bags. A home health worker told Dickens and Dow to put Moore's things, whatever they didn't want to keep, in the bags.\nInstead, Dow stared into space. Dickens meticulously rewrote his poems into a composition book, each letter minuscule but perfectly formed.\n\"I'm alphabetizing them to see what I have,\" he told Dow, who squinted.\n\"I've got to use a magnifying glass just to read it, as small as your handwriting is,\" he said.\nDickens thumbed halfway through the book and stopped on the poem he'd titled, \"I only cry when the sun is moonlit.\"\n\"This is the one I wanted to read at my mother's funeral,\" he said.\nHe started writing in prison after he was convicted in 2011 on felony burglary charges at age 18. Poetry had kept him out of trouble since, he said. He wrote 160 poems in the five months between moving in with his mother and her death.\nMoore encouraged him to publish them. Anything was possible, she said. All her life people told her she wasn't college material. She waited until her 40s to start, but finished her first two semesters at Umpqua with As and Bs in business and keyboarding. She struggled in writing classes, though, and told Dickens he must have inherited his poetic streak from his father's side of the family.\n\"My mother told me I am related to Charles Dickens and Little Jimmy Dickens,\" Dickens told Dow. \"I'm trying to get at least 1,000 poems published before I die. That way people can notice me for who I am.\"\nNeither spoke for a minute. Finally, Dow broke the silence: \"You mean a butthead?\"\nHe laughed. Dickens smirked. Everyone else walked on eggshells around them. Teasing each other eased the tension.\n\"Do you remember the first thing I said to you when you moved here?\" Dow said. \"I said, 'Where's your green card?'\"\nDickens had told him he had a \"black card,\" the luxury, high earner's Visa.\n\"I said, 'It's highly expensive. I can meet the president any time I want,'\" Dickens said. \"And then I really did.\"\n\"He looked more dorkier in person,\" Dow said.\n\"I have to agree with that,\" Dickens said.\n\"We were just a layover for him.\"\n\"That's what he said,\" Dickens said. \"Just a quick pit stop on his way to Seattle or San Francisco or on the way back to his big mansion.\"\nThey lit Marlboro Reds and smoked in silence. Occasionally Dow covered his face and cried. He asked Dickens to stay close, not to talk and not to leave.\nMostly, they watched the dog, a 97-pound baby twitching in his sleep. Dickens put a reassuring hand on his white muzzle. A witness told CNN that the dog lay beside Moore's wheelchair when the gunman ordered everyone to the floor. She said that the shooter told Moore to climb back in her wheelchair, then shot her as she tried to get up.\n\"I wouldn't want to see what he has seen,\" Dow said, petting Bullet. \"I just wouldn't.\"\nAnother knock on the door interrupted this line of thought. Dow didn't answer the visitors anymore, so Dickens greeted the woman and old man outside.\n\"Will we see you at the vigil?\" the woman asked.\nMyrtle Creek was hosting a memorial that night to honor two residents who died in the shooting, Moore and 18-year-old Rebecka Carnes.\nDow wasn't going. \"It would be too traumatic,\" he said. Dickens thought attending might help somehow.\nHe had worn through the soles of his one pair of shoes, but Dickens didn't have a car, so he walked the mile through town to Mill Site Park, slowing to look in the window of the hardware store and other shops in case any sported a new \"help wanted\" notice. He thought he saw an opportunity taped to the door of a coffee shop. But it wasn't a job announcement, just a photograph of his mother on a poster announcing the vigil.\nOther victims' families set up GoFundMe accounts in the first hours and days after the shooting. People have donated more than $800,000 to Chris Mintz, a former soldier who was shot but survived. Dickens didn't own a computer, and thus didn't have a GoFundMe account until a stranger finally set one up a week after the shooting. By then, the urge to give had mostly passed. So far, Moore's page has just $2,000 in pledges.\nEven with those donations, Dickens and Dow lack the money to stay in their 620-square-foot apartment for much longer. Moore had been dipping into her school loans to cover rent for the three of them.\n***\nFrom the edge of the park, a lush green bowl nestled between foothills, Dickens could see about 150 people gathered near the wooden amphitheater. Most wore t-shirts commemorating the victims, white tees with green outlines of Oregon and a heart to mark Umpqua Community College.\nDickens pulled his jean jacket closed over a plain blue t-shirt and stood behind the crowd. A stranger handed him a candle.\nThe sun began to set, and Dickens watched the tiny flame flicker as speakers talked about Carnes and his mother.\n\"If you remember seeing a lady out waiting for a bus with a dog and in a wheelchair,\" Mayor Ken Brouillard said. \"Well, that was Sarena.\"\nFew people really knew his mother. He didn't, either. They'd spent so much time talking about the future that Dickens barely asked about her past.\nAnother man took the stage and urged the crowd to reach out to people who, like the shooter, may feel ostracized. Maybe they could prevent future tragedies with compassion.\n\"You need to reach out to the outcast,\" Jorge Valenzuela told the crowd. \"They need to be heard, and you need to be the one that listens and shows them that there's somebody here for them.\"\nDickens looked around, still searching in vain for a familiar face, then sat down alone. A wind rushed through and blew out his candle. He pulled out a lighter and flicked it a few times, but the wick wouldn't catch.\n***\nThe next morning, classes began again at Umpqua Community College. Hundreds of people lined the narrow road to campus, supporting teachers and students as they returned to the scene of the crime.\nDickens and Dow didn't go, couldn't imagine visiting the spot where Sarena Moore went and died without them. They stayed up all night watching DVDs of \"CSI: Miami,'' then arose to drink Pepsi and smoke in silence amid Moore's belongings.\nThat Monday morning was the first since the shooting without any visitors. Finally, at noon, two Department of Human Service workers knocked on the door.\n\"We brought dog food,\" one said.\n\"Is Bullet here?\" the other asked. \"Can we pet him?\"\nThe dog, familiar with the routine by now, grunted and pulled himself up to greet his guests. He lumbered toward the door.\nThe visitors stood in the doorway for 10 minutes or so, stroking Bullet, who wagged his tail when they called him a hero.\n\"People keep asking why the guy didn't shoot Bullet, too,\" Dow said after they left. \"People said it's because he didn't pose no threat to him. Of course, Sarena didn't pose no threat to him either.\"\nMoore and Dow had planned to marry Jan. 2. Moore wanted to ride a horse down the aisle. Dow planned to wear a cowboy hat and a western shirt. Dickens would be the ring bearer, if they found money for a wedding band.\n\"There's no manual for this,\" Dow said. \"Nothing that says, 'Talk to ATF. Talk to a counselor. Meet Obama. Go home.'\"\nDickens lit another cigarette and exhaled a long, deep breath. He'd begun to worry about what came next. No vigil or donation or presidential meeting could bring her, or any of the nine, back. Dow was all Dickens had left, and he couldn't figure a way they could stay together.\n\"Travis, if I had the money to, I would be taking care of you,\" he told his would-be stepfather. \"But I ain't got the money or resources to.\"\nDow's daughter invited him to live with her in McMinnville. He'll take the dog and Moore's remains. He wants to bury the urn somewhere deep in the woods.\nWhen the money from the GoFundMe comes in, Dickens said, he'll buy a bus ticket. Maybe he'll live on a ranch, somewhere with horses, to remind him of his mother. He won't be able to carry much of her belongings with him, but he plans to keep an old-out-of-tune guitar she left behind.\nHe'd always assumed she would teach him how to play.\n-- Casey Parks\n503-221-8271\ncparks@oregonian.com; @caseyparks\nLynne Palombo, Beth Nakamura, Tony Hernandez and Bryan Denson contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/caseyparks", "https://www.atf.gov/", "https://www.gofundme.com/mintz", "https://www.gofundme.com/SarenaMooreUCC"], "published": "2015-10-25T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:12:29.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
