He also hits on who Marionville models their effort after in hopes of reaching the Class 1 State Championship Game. Sampson: You guys came into the season knowing you had a lot of talent and that you had expectations to win this class. Have you been uptight at any point this season? LaSalle: We normally stay pretty loose. We're all good friends and we get focused when we need to. We know what everyone is going to bring to the table. We know which guys you can't push and who you have to lay off. We have a bunch of seniors in this class and, since the summer basically, we've been focused. We've all been beaten by Valle Catholic the last two years, and we know to get back to them we've got to beat some really good teams. Sampson: When I talked to you guys in August, Valle Catholic came up a lot. How has that mentality worked? You guys are 7-0, so how do you balance the opponent each week with having them in the back of your mind? LaSalle: If you're thinking about Valle Catholic, you know you're going to have to practice and play harder. That, in turn, will get you prepared to play each week. We're in the Mid-Lakes so there are going to be tough teams each week with schools that are bigger than us. If you think about Valle Catholic and how hard they're practicing, that'll get us prepared. Sampson: Is this a week where you put them totally out of mind because you have the No. 3 team in Class 1 on the horizon? LaSalle: The last thing I'm thinking about right now is Valle Catholic. Skyline has all sorts of athletes all over the field. We've gotten the best of them each of the last two years and I know they want to beat us badly. We want to beat them badly as well and neither of us has won the conference in a few years. Sampson: How have you improved as a quarterback this year? LaSalle: I think I'm throwing the ball a lot better. I've thrown only two interceptions. I'm taking care of the ball better. We're all on the same page with what we want and what we need to do to get there and that's helped me improve. Sampson: You're the first quarterback I've sat down this year who is the son of a head coach. For those who may not understand, what is that relationship like? LaSalle: He's been coaching me since third grade. At home, we talk about football quite a bit. Our family pretty much revolves around football. On the practice field, he's on me 24/7, but we do a pretty good job of balancing our lives. Sampson: Your dad played for his father as well. Now, with your grandfather on the staff as well, how do those two voices from two separate generations differentiate? LaSalle: My dad is definitely harder on me, which is normal. We go to my grandfather's house after church on Sunday, so we talk about football while we're there and what happened Friday. He can definitely cool me down better. Sampson: You're familiar with your counterpart at Skyline, Dylan Mountain. You playing defense as well, what challenges does he bring? LaSalle: First off, he's just athletically just gifted beyond anybody that we play. You rush him, you think you have him, and you're not even close to bringing him down. He throws the ball well and if he busts the pocket, you're in trouble. The game plan is pretty much: you have to stop him if you want to beat him.
