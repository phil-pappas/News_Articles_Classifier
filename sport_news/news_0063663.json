Source: Reuters\nSio has his right arm in a sling but the Wallabies are happy to wait and let the injury settle down before making a decision.\n“He’s got a massive haematoma on his elbow, he’s got no range at all,” Cheika said.\n“The haematoma will go down and that will give him more range. It will all be about has there been damage done to his elbow and will he be able to perform his job.”\nSio’s power at loosehead has been superb for much of the tournament, but after being tested by the Scots, the scrum will need to be at its absolute best against the notoriously muscular Pumas pack.\nPocock will also be desperately needed given the attacking pace the Argentinians now also possess. The No.8’s ability to shut down a team’s momentum with turnovers is crucial.\nCheika said Pocock and Folau were progressing positively.\n“I’d like to think we’re going to have our strongest squad available and that they’re more chance of playing than not,” Cheika said.\n“(Pocock) just has a strain there in one of the sections of his calf. He has run (on Sunday) pain free which is always a good sign with that injury.\n“Often with that injury too it’s about the return to play and how you manage it, because if you don’t it will recur.\n“We’ve been really conscious of that and making sure we don’t push too hard.\n“We’re in the last 12 to 13 days now, we know we’ve got the groundwork done, so we don’t need to push anyone, we just need to make sure everyone’s right.\nIsrael Folau is ‘a better chance of playing than not’. Source: Getty Images\n“We need to work hard still but make sure everyone’s right for the games.”\nAsked if believed the Wallabies could win a World Cup without Pocock in the side, Cheika sidestepped the question and instead praised the squad’s depth.\n“I’ve got to think about whether we can win on Sunday, not the World Cup. That’s all there is in front of us,” Cheika said.\n“The target is still a way away yet and Sunday is a very, very big day in relation to getting to that goal. But in itself it’s a challenge. I think that the team has got a certain depth that I’ve really enjoyed.\n“I think (Ben) McCalman had a great game yesterday coming in. We’ve been able to change a few different players around. I thought Kurtley Beale was outstanding at fullback.”\n Pocock, Folau on track as Sio hope grows", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F20%2FFSD_201015_RUN_CHEIKA_MON_GRABS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f04b6fb75dbab00462770536c55bb659", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ff90fb1a8d7d184223df8ea32860e217", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1d8016c3cf12eacd3fa26ce9c3d861c6", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/rugby/rugby-world-cup-wallabies-get-scott-sio-david-pocock-israel-folau-injury-boosts/story-fni2fxyf-1227575445441", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:47:53.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
