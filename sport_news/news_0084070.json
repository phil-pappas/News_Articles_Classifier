But many supporters — those who understand the vital nature of it being a team game and others with ties to his playing days in Utah — swiftly came to the punter O’Neill’s defense.\nO’Neill, who hails from Melbourne, Australia, averaged a school-record 44.1 yards per punt while playing a lone season at Weber State in 2014, an average that was sixth-best in the country in the FCS. He joined Michigan as a graduate transfer this season.\nAll-American Utah punter Tom Hackett, who’s also Australian, stood up for his fellow countryman.\n“Find it strange when I’m reading death threats written to my good mate @blakewoneill, the game is full of mistakeshead up mate,” Hackett tweeted Sunday.\nWeber State’s Jay Hill, O’Neill’s head coach last year, told CBS Sports that the punter’s experience playing Australian Rules Football may have played a factor in the play. With 10 seconds remaining and Michigan facing a fourth-and-2 leading 23-21, O'Neill bobbled the snap on a punt attempt. He picked it up to try to get off a punt but again fumbled the ball. Michigan State's Jalen Watts-Jackson picked up the loose ball and returned it 38 yards for the game-winning score as time expired.\n“If you watch Australian Rules Football, those guys are used to kicking with people draped over them in traffic,” Hill said. “My guess is his natural instincts took over and he thought he could get the kick off. They do that 20 times a game with something similar, and it just didn't go his way this time.”\nAll this came on a day when O’Neill had booted an 80-yard punt — the second-longest in school history — and pinned three other punts inside the 20 earlier in the game. On the year, the senior O’Neill is averaging 41.1 yards per punt for the Wolverines.\nHill told CBS Sports that the ambitious O’Neill, who modeled in Australia, approached the coach after last season with a list of five schools he’d like to transfer to because Weber State didn’t offer the graduate program he desired. That list was comprised entirely of Power 5 schools: Michigan, USC, Florida, Texas and Oregon.\n“I thought he was an All-American for us,” Hill said. “I coached Tom Hackett and I thought Blake was the same caliber kid. He would have been a big-time weapon for us.”\nMichigan Interim Athletic Director Jim Hackett denounced those who shared harsh words aimed at O’Neill in a letter posted Sunday, via thewolverine.com .\n“Today I awake to the shocking reality that our community who cares so much about this program would send hurtful, spiteful and vicious comments to one of our students. To be clear, such comments come from a small minority, none of whom are reflective of our institution,” the letter said.\n“The program I know at Michigan speaks about the team, the team, the team. The people I have been associated with my whole life around this fantastic program — some whom are living and some whom have passed on — would never, I repeat never, spread blame.\n“As our head coach said yesterday, ‘this outcome will steel our spine.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:24:26.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
