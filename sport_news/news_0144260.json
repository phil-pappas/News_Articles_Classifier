They had a real athletic running back, and our job was to contain him,” St. Joseph coach Tino Villarreal said. “The boys were playing really hard … my hat’s off to them, they had a great game plan and they executed it perfectly.” \nThe Bloodhounds’ defense forced a fumble and intercepted a pass to put their takeaway total at 30. St. Joseph has not had a turnover on offense this season. \nQuarterback Kai Money and running backs Mario Garcia and Anthony Cantu moved the chains for the St. Joseph offense all game, building a 37-0 lead at halftime. \nGarcia, who found the end zone five times on the ground, led the Bloodhounds. Money ran for a score and threw two touchdown passes, one each to receivers Bernie de la Garza and Gerardo Moses. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:48:35.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
