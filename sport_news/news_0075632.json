Comment Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 10:42 PM By Chris Zadorozny Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 10:42 PM PORTLAND - Just like Marty McFly and Doc Brown in Back to the Future, there was a little time traveling going on in Portland on Wednesday. The final Central Michigan Athletic Conference (CMAC) Jamboree of the cross country season was held at Portland Country Club. It was historic in that Portland St. Patrick hosted the meet, the first time hosting in over 50 years. It went off without a hitch, other than some some rain and lighting in the distance, to give it a more Back to the Future feel. The Pewamo-Westphalia boy’s and girl’s cross country teams were crowned CMAC champs as they won their third consecutive CMAC Jamboree. The boy’s won with 33 points and the girl’s won with 24 points. Saranac boy’s were fourth and the girl’s fourth as well. Portland St. Patrick boy’s finished seventh while the girl’s only had three runners, not enough for a full team. Pirates head coach Scott Werner liked that the team’s mentality is positive heading into next week’s regionals. Senior Audrey Pohl won the girl’s race (19:25.1) for the Pirates. Right behind her, well, not immediately behind her, but in second place was junior Brenna Wirth (20:09.1). Sophomore Brooklyn Nurenberg finished in third (20:14.2). Fellow sophomore Brooke Stump was sixth (20:46.1). All earned 1st team honors in the CMAC. On the second team, junior Olivia Nurenberg from the Pirates in 11th place (21:07.4). From Saranac, freshmen Katelyn Haskins and Sidney Klynstra in 13th (21:19.7) and 14th (21:20.5) respectively. Pewamo-Westphalia senior Emma Arens was honorable mention in 16th place (21:36.8). Saranac senior Madelyn Miller was 17th (21:43.6) followed by Pirate sophomore Claudia Heckman in 18th (21:51.3). Rounding out the honorable mention was Pirate senior Jessica Schafer (22:02.5). On the boy’s side, Bath junior Cole Trevino won the race (17:05.4). Pewamo-Westphalia junior Bryce Thelen was second (17:12.5). Pirate junior Brock Simon was fourth (17:23.0). Senior Grant Hengesbach was sixth (17:33.7) and Saranac senior Kyle VanSpronsen was seventh (17:34.9) to round out the 1st team. Pirate freshman Mitch Nurenberg was ninth (17:40.5), Shamrock senior Isaac Brown was 11th (17:49.0) followed by Pirate junior Zach Schmitz in 12th (17:49.5). Saranac junior Connor McElvain finished in 14th (17:51.9) to round out the 2nd team honors. For honorable mention, Pirate sophomore Trent Barker was 15th (17:56.2), Saranac senior Jared Melcher was 17th (18:10.7) and Pirate freshman Keith Schafer was 19th (18:12.3).
