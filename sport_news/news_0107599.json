But Klaus Stoehlker, a close associate of Blatter, told The Associated Press on Friday that the Swiss official is aiming to be back at work very soon. \n“He has made an appeal and everybody hopes there will be a decision in the next 10 days,” Stoehlker said. “He is very, very tough … he is sure he will have the right to be back. He doesn’t feel he is out of the job. That’s a huge misunderstanding.” \nBoth Blatter and UEFA president Michel Platini were given 90-day bans in the wake of a Swiss criminal case investigating financial misconduct at FIFA. \nBlatter has lodged an appeal, his lawyers said Friday, and has asked for the ethics committee to release the reasons for the suspension. Platini has also said he will fight the decision. \nEven if Blatter’s appeal fails, he could be back to work before the emergency presidential election scheduled for Feb. 26. Platini, however, would likely be forced out of the running to succeed Blatter if his expected appeal fails. \nGiven the extent of the crisis, however, the election could be postponed. That would be a decision for the FIFA executive committee, which will meet on Oct. 20. \n“We have to discuss this among ourselves and then we decide,” Cypriot executive committee member Marios Lefkaritis told the AP. “It’s not something automatically (to say) ‘Yes or no.’ It’s a very important topic item.” \nOne option could be to shift the election to the annual congress, which is due to be held in Mexico in May. \nThe acting FIFA president is Issa Hayatou, the head of the African soccer confederation. Hours after taking over as president on Thursday, Hayatou defended himself from accusations of corruption, denying that he and another former FIFA executive committee member received bribes of $1.5 million from Qatar at a meeting in Angola in early 2010. \n“Someone said he was there when we were given $1.5 million each in Angola?,” said the 69-year-old Hayatou, who is from Cameroon. “It’s cash. How do you give each of us $1.5 million in Angola?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:47:06.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
