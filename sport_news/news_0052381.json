Add a mention that the next opponent, Kansas State, just got blown out 55-0 at home by Oklahoma and coach Charlie Strong will be fighting to prevent a dangerous level of self-satisfaction from settling in. \nStrong himself fielded only a handful of questions about Kansas State at his weekly news conference, which was dominated by the theme of whether his program had finally turned things around. \n“So much has happened. We had never lost our team. It wasn’t like the earth was falling,” said Strong, who was tossed in the air in celebration by his players after the victory. “Now that it has happened for them, you just hope the confidence continues to build on and on.” \nBut Strong can also tell his players to look in the mirror to size up what’s coming next. \nKansas State (3-3, 0-3) has lost three in a row. Before the blowout by Oklahoma, the Wildcats had dropped excruciating late losses to Oklahoma State and TCU. \nLike Texas did with Oklahoma, the Wildcats will be eyeing the Longhorns as a chance to turn their season around. \nStrong watched only a few plays of Saturday’s game, chalked it up as a bad day for Kansas State and paid no more attention. \n“I know that’s not who that football team is,” Strong said. “The same thing happened to us. We were able to bounce back. Be ready for a team that comes ready to play, a team that’s mentally and physically tough.” \nTexas players remember a 23-0 loss at Kansas State last year, arguably the low point for the Texas offense in Strong’s two seasons. And they remember the beating they took from their own fans after getting blown out two weeks ago by TCU. \nKansas State will be going through the same thing. \n“They’re going to hear it all week,” Texas senior wide receiver Marcus Johnson said. “They’ll be a different team.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:39:28.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
