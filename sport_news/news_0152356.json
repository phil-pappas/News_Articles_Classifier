In fact, virtually every tweet is the same two words: “I’m up.”\nSo what’s the point? No, it’s not alerting his nearly 10,000 followers that he’s awake and ready to start his day. Instead, it’s Sloan’s way of saying, after spending the past five years trying to establish himself as an NBA player, he’s ready to do what it takes each day to stay in the league.\n“I’m up grinding, working out, physically and mentally getting myself ready for whatever’s next,” he said. “Long story short, it’s my time. I’m up.”\nSloan didn’t play in Monday’s preseason-opening loss to Fenerbahce at Barclays Center, but hopes to play for the first time when the Nets face the Pistons on Thursday night.\nEither way, you can be sure you’ll see an “I’m up” tweet Thursday morning, something Sloan has done daily since December 2011, when training camp was wrapping up for the Hawksbefore the 66-game lockout-shortened regular season.\nSloan, who had spent the previous season playing for the Reno Bighorns in the D-League, woke up before dawn and couldn’t go back to sleep while waiting for the news of whether he had achieved his dream of making it to the NBA.\n“I just knew, OK, this is the day I’m going to make it or not,” he said. “So I go on Twitter and just said, ‘I’m up.’\nI'm up\n— Donald Sloan (@dsloan15) October 7, 2015 \n\n“Three or four hours later, I found out I made the team, and I figured it’s only up from here.”\nSince then, Sloan has bounced around the league, getting a pair of stints with both the Cavaliers and Hornets before spending part of the 2012-13 season in China with the Guangdong Southern Tigers.\nThings were supposed to be different after he spent the past two years with the Pacers. Following a breakout 2014-15 season in which he played 53 games and started 21, averaging 7.4 points with a robust 3-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, Sloan went into this summer thinking he finally would have the long-term security he sought.\nInstead, he found himself on the outside looking in on the free agencymerry-go-round, before eventually coming to an agreement on a one-year deal with the Nets. Either Sloan or undrafted rookie Ryan Boatright is expected to be the team’s third point guard.\n“I thought Donald Sloan’s athleticism, size and quickness could help us,” coach Lionel Hollins said. “We’re looking for a third guard, and he was a guy that was out there that showed a little bit of tenacity and toughness, as well as athleticism and quickness.” \nThe Nets only having two point guards — Jarrett Jack and Shane Larkin — assured of making the roster, so it was an easy choice for Sloan to come to Brooklyn, where he saw the potential to both make the team and earn playing time.\n“I love the opportunity,” Sloan said. “If anywhere, here. This is the perfect place for me to come in and show what I can do, and kind of leave my mark, and prove that I can be one of the guys out there running the show.”\n“I proved I could do that last year in Indiana, so I’m just looking for carryover.”\nAndrea Bargnani (tight right hamstring), Bojan Bogdanovic (sore right ankle), Markel Brown (left oblique strain), Willie Reed (right quad strain), Thomas Robinson (right wrist sprain) and Chris McCullough (knee surgery rehab) all sat out of Wednesday’s practice. Only Bogdanovic and Brown, however, remained home.\nNets general manager Billy King said the Nets’ goal for McCullough, who had surgery in February for a torn ACL suffered in January while playing at Syracuse, is “for him to get on the court this season.” The team said no further updates will be provided on the 6-foot-10 forward’s progress.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brooklyn nets ,  donald sloan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:40:03.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
