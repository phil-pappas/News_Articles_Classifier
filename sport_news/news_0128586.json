Nope—never mind,” I countered a moment later. “He’s taking a panoramic photo on his iPhone.”\nIt was our last day on Mallorca and the weather was flawless—warm and cloud-free. We’d been on the island for just over a week, but thanks to frequent afternoon rains and our (OK, my) uncanny ability to get lost, each of our many attempts to find an idyllic beach had been thwarted until then.\nBy all accounts, Mallorca has no shortage of beautiful beaches; we should have been tripping over them. Instead, we’d spent an absurd amount of time on the Internet checking the weather and searching for a quiet, isolated, white-sand cove lapped by placid blue water: the kind of fantasy beach we’d seen in so many Instagram posts and whose Siren song had lured us to this island off the eastern coast of Spain in the first place.\nNear the beginning of our trip, on a rare sunny afternoon, we’d hiked along the coast for over two hours trying to find a beach our Airbnb host had recommended. Pouring with sweat, we dutifully followed arrows on hand-painted signs that led down a precarious trail to some forbidding rocks upon which a few people were sunning themselves. But there was no sand and hardly room for us to lie down, so we turned back.\nDid the peaceful, singular sweep of sand we imagined even exist?\nBy our second-to-last day, we had still not found our fantasy beach. It was raining yet again, but a tap on my iPhone weather app revealed the next day’s forecast: 74 degrees and a golden sun unobscured by clouds.\nWe changed our flights, extended our trip two nights and moved to another Airbnb on the opposite end of the island, near Calo des Moro, a beach we’d spotted online. It looked like a giant, crystal-blue swimming pool framed by an empty stretch of talcum powder and two cliffs that protected it from the open sea.\n‘ Digitally driven narcissism outshone the pristine setting. ’\nIn the morning, we packed a picnic and drove toward Calo des Moro. When we arrived, the small parking lot was filled. “How can it be full already?” I asked my girlfriend, the worry apparent in my voice. We parked on the side of the road and followed the parade of fellow beachgoers through a gate marked “Private!” (I’m usually law-abiding but I reasoned that if all of those people were allowed on the beach, so were we.) After a short hike, I could make out what looked like our fantasy beach beginning to materialize in the distance.\nWe all hiked down the steep trail toward the water like a procession of so many pilgrims. Here was the scenery my girlfriend and I had imagined, minus the serenity. The place was packed and called to mind the iconic, black-and-white 1942 Weegee photo of Coney Island’s beach so crowded with bodies that it looks almost pixilated. The only difference was that, 75 years later, everyone is a Weegee. Amateur photographers were passing iPhones back and forth like hot potatoes and waving their selfie sticks in the air like sabers. One guy had a strange, lipstick-shaped camera mounted next to his temple on a headband. And then there was the man I mistook for a tai chi guru…\nWe tried to relax but instead found ourselves quietly deriding the people mugging all around us. It wasn’t enough for them to simply snap a photo and have a swim: The entire experience had to be stored in HD and uploaded so that “likes” could be tallied and feelings of vacationer schadenfreude fanned. “It’s like all the people I unfollowed on social media in one place,” my girlfriend said. “If only I could unsubscribe from these people right now.” We had to admit, though, that we found the digitally driven narcissism on display more compelling than the setting.\n“The future,” I mused to her, “will be all about finding better ways to shoot photos and videos that nobody will ever want to look at.”\nEventually we’d had enough of the crowd and their cameras. We abandoned our spot, which was immediately set upon by another couple, and climbed back up the steep trail to where we had first spied the beach.\n“We should probably take a selfie,” I said. “Otherwise, how will anyone ever know we were here?” We both laughed. And then I framed the shot, carefully cropping out the crowd, and we smiled into the phone. To date, the picture has 39 likes on Instagram.\nENLARGE Dan Crane Dan Crane is the author of “To Air Is Human: One Man’s Quest to Become the World’s Greatest Air Guitarist,” published by Riverhead Books.\nMore in Adventure & Travel A Weekend Away in Southern England’s Wine Country Europe’s Steaks Get a Makeover Travelers Can Savor Touring Funen, Denmark’s Legitimate Fairy-Tale Island Mix Hiking and Hedonism at These Resorts The Day Trips Parisians Take Themselves A Tour of Chicago’s Bloomingdale Trail Road-Tripping Through Edward Hopper’s Maine", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS435_TRAVTA_1000V_20151012134104.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/wsj/wsj-adventure-travel/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS435_TRAVTA_750V_20151012134104.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS435_TRAVTA_360V_20151012134104.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/7VfZdZsGXi/"], "published": "2015-10-13T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:07:41.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
