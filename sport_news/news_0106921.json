These wondrous last three months. The MVP trying to be MVP again. The kid closer trying to be hero again. A Blue Jays team that never stopped coming, went right down to the final at bat of the most exciting season in 22 years. \nAnd this is it. Now over. We’re not sure yet how to feel. There was too much to take in. To much to see. To many moments, trades, signings, pickups, home runs and wins. That was this Blue Jays season to remember. \nIt didn’t end with a World Series win or even a win in the American League Championship Series. It ended on a damp, dark and rainy night in Missouri, with them being pushed to the canvas and fighting back, pushed to the canvas again, and fighting some more. \nEven after a 45-minute rain delay put the game and the series on hold, the Blue Jays came out and almost instantly put themselves in trouble. Roberto Osuna came out to pitch the eighth inning and he was walked Lorenzo Cain as the leadoff man. You walk the leadoff man he scores. That’s how it works. \nJust not like this. Cain scored from first on a base hit by Eric Hosmer - a Johnny Pesky hold the ball kind of moment without Jose Bautista holding the ball in right field. Cain never stopped, speeding around the bases. And that felt like a punch to the gut, the kind you never recover from. \nBut this Jays team, they never stopped recovering. That’s what they did almost all season long. Get down. Fight back. Get down again. Fight back some more. This wasnt the best matchup for them, this fiery Kansas City team, but they went right to the top of the ninth, and were still in a position to tie the game, but like most teams in baseball, couldn’t solve Wade Davis. \nRussell Martin worked a walk to start the ninth inning, which he can do. And then Kevin Pillar, normally not the walking type, did the same. There were two men on base and nobody out and Dioner Navarro at the plate. He needed to get his bat on the ball but couldn’t. Pompey stole a base then Pillar stole a base. \nAll they needed was a base hit. \nBen Revere struck out after Navarro struck out. And Donaldson, the heart, soul and likely American League MVP, grounded to third base to end the series. \nThe kind of situation he would normally deliver on. But there is no normal when you’re Davis. Just as there was no normal in his season. The Bringer of Rain had nothing to do with the rain that fell on the night this season ended and the base hit just wasn’t to be. \nNow it’s over and a city and a country won’t know what to do with its days and nights. No game to watch. No move to question or debate. Nothing in common to talk about. This has been every day and every afternoon and so much of what we’ve been consumed by. This was a sporting story Toronto hasn’t known since - ever - because the championship runs of 1992 and 1993 were fabulous, just not nearly as engaging or dramatic. \nAll his baseball life Jose Bautista wanted this, this playoff run, this kind of team to call his own. Then he hit the home run that won the American League Division Series and he hit two home runs Friday night that put the Jays in position to play Game 7 on Saturday night. \nThose were life changing moments for a player who grabbed the largest stage and sang loudly. So many of his teammates did the same in their own way. Marcus Stroman playing the part of future ace. Troy Tulowitzki, so natural at shortstop, winning three games with huge hits. Marco Estrada and Navarro combining in the least likely pitcher-catcher success story in baseball. The manager, John Gibbons, made all the right moves Friday night, just didn’t get the victory for his efforts. \nDavid Price, after two early home runs, did the job. The kids in the bullpen, so great all season long, Aaron Sanchez and Osuna, couldn’t make the pitches necessary . They had done this before. Just not Friday night. Not against this fine hitting Royals team. \nAll this on Paul Beeston’s last real night as Blue Jays president, his final game after 28 seasons in Toronto. His contract expires next Saturday as does that of general manager Alex Anthopoulos. It’s expected Anthopoulos will be back, although that’s not entirely certain. This was a Blue Jays team for the ages, some like Osuna at the beginning. Many players at their Blue Jays end. \nIt’s likely the end of three months for Price, who will be an expensive free agent, and there are so many other unknowns around him. Estrada is a free agent as is his catcher Navarro. The Jays probably want both back. \nMark Buehrle is likely to retire and LaTroy Hawkins will. There is a pitching staff to be rebuilt by Anthopoulos and incoming president Mark Shapiro and there is money to do that. \nThe team remains in strong shape with a good returning lineup and an array of decent contracts. But they won’t, can’t be the same. This was a once-in-a-lifetime, capturing the country, kind of season. The expectations will change in the future. This won’t be so new, so exciting, so incredible. \nIt can’t be. \nThis is painful right now. Personal. Frustrating. With a feeling of pride and accomplishment. At its best, that’s what sports can do. And without a World Series win, an ALCS win, this was still at its best. And nobody was really ready for it to end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:19:05.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
