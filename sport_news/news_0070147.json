Javontae Rosser made it 20-6 on a run. Shortly afterward, Corey Bridges connected with Chris Moore from the same distance. Lewis’ extra-point pushed East Coweta further ahead 20-6 at halftime. \nDefenses took over in the second half, with neither offense scoring after halftime. \nThe lone touchdown following the break came on Austin Bunn’s fumble recovery of a fumbled punt. \nMadras and East Coweta met during the regular season on Sept. 15, in a game won by East Coweta 48-18. \nMadras, which last won the CCMSAL Championship in 2013, picked up two touchdowns from Jake Barberio in the second quarter on runs of 2 and 52 yards in last week’s semifinal win over Lee. \nTanner Hughes added an 81-yard scamper after halftime for the Eagles. The defensive effort for the Eagles was led by Barron Sher- rer, Donovan Brundidge and Camden Brooks. \nEAST COWETA FEEDER TEAMS GO UNDEFEATED: A majority of players from last year’s CCMSAL champion- ship team from Lee continued to make an impact while moving closer to joining the varsity. \nEast Coweta’s ninth grade team recently finished its 2015 season unbeaten for the first time after defeating Northgate 20-7 on Wednesday. The Indians’ wins also came against Whitewater (27- 6), Sandy Creek (34-14) and Newnan (22-12). \nThe team also overcame adversity during the season following the death of lineman Desmond Byrd. East Coweta honored his mem- ory prior to its victory over Newnan. \n“They dedicated this season to him,” said East Coweta coach Todd Beldon. \nEast Coweta’s junior varsity also finished undefeated this year.
