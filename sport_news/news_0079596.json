Another group of planes formed the number 70 in the sky.\nKim, who is in his early 30s, walked down a red carpet and saluted his honor guard before taking the podium to deliver the often fiery speech.\n“Our revolutionary force is ready to respond to any kind of war the American imperialists want,” he said, flanked by visiting Chinese official Liu Yunshan and senior North Korean officials. He said North Korea’s policy of putting its military first has made it “an impenetrable fortress and a global military power.”\nBut, reflecting North Korea’s international isolation, no world leaders were present.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:06:55.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
