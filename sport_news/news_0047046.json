We are the only team who has beaten (Leicester), so I don’t see why we should not believe we can beat Manchester United.” \nI like to win \nUnited manager Louis van Gaal describes Wenger, who this week celebrates 19 years with Arsenal, as “one of the best coaches in the world”, but says that he would not like to endure a comparable league title drought. \n“I have won a lot of titles and I want to do that in different countries,” said Van Gaal, whose side beat Wolfsburg 2-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday to register a fourth successive victory. \n“Not only in the Netherlands, but after that in Spain and after that in Germany, and after that in England. That’s my ambition. I am not that type. I like to win a lot.” \nMichael Carrick is available for United after missing the Wolfsburg game with what Van Gaal described as “tiredness”, but it is not known if his fellow midfielder Ander Herrera, who also sat out that match, is fit. \nWhile Cech is expected to come in for Ospina, Arsenal will be without centre-back Laurent Koscielny, who sustained a hamstring injury against Olympiakos that saw him join Mathieu Flamini, Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and Tomas Rosicky on the sidelines. \nLast season United won 2-1 at the Emirates, where they have lost just once in seven visits, and Van Gaal believes another victory would fuel belief that his team can maintain their position until the end of the campaign. \n“I think you have to believe always in this (winning the title) and I think the balance in our selection is much better than last year,” he said. \n“And last year we also had the chance, so I believe in that, but the most important thing is not only that I believe, but that the players are believing in that. \n“And when we win at Arsenal, then the belief shall rise a lot.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:58:17.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
