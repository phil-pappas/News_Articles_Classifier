Washington had the first possession of OT, and Kirk Cousins moved the team to midfield. When wide receiver Ryan Grant slipped on a pass route, Alford caught Cousins’ pass and was left with open field down the Falcons’ sideline for the touchdown. Devonta Freeman’s apparent 13-yard TD catch in the final minute of regulation was ruled incomplete on a review. Freeman scored on 6-yard run two plays later to give Atlanta a 19-16 lead. Dustin Hopkins’ 52-yard field goal on the final play of regulation forced overtime. The Falcons (5-0) overcame two interceptions and a lost fumble by Matt Ryan. Freeman had 27 carries for 153 yards and the touchdown. GIANTS 30, 49ERS 27 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Larry Donnell’s spectacular catch over two 49ers with 21 seconds remaining lifted New York past San Francisco, capping Eli Manning’s sensational clutch performance. Manning had a career-best 41 completions and his perfect throw to Donnell finished off an 82-yard drive with a 12-yard touchdown. It made him the winningest quarterback in team history with 102. New York (3-2) has won three straight and leads the NFC East. San Francisco (1-4) has lost four in a row. BROWNS 33, RAVENS 30, OT BALTIMORE — Travis Coons kicked a 32-yard field goal in overtime and Josh McCown threw for a team-record 457 yards. Cleveland (2-3) had lost 13 of the previous 14 meetings between these AFC North foes, but in this one the Browns rallied from a 12-point deficit to leave the Ravens (1-4) alone in the division cellar. Playing its second straight overtime game, Baltimore went three-and-out on the first possession of the extra session. McCown then used more than seven minutes to move the Browns 51 yards before Coons kicked his fourth field goal with 6:43 left in OT. PACKERS 24, RAMS 10 GREEN BAY, Wis. — Aaron Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and 241 yards, but his impressive string of not being intercepted at Lambeau Field ended. Rodgers was 19 of 30 for 241 yards with long scoring strikes to receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones. But NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis’ diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3). Rodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third. Relentless pressure on quarterback Nick Foles helped keep the Packers (5-0) unbeaten. Foles threw a career-worst four interceptions, two in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10. PATS 30, COWBOYS 6 ARLINGTON, Texas — Tom Brady threw for two touchdowns, with a 1-yard plunge for another score, and the Patriots pulled away from a powerless Dallas offense missing Tony Romo and Dez Bryant. Brady guided two long touchdown drives in the second half after getting sacked five times before halftime, including once each by Greg Hardy and Rolando McClain in their returns from four-game suspensions. The 38-year-old Brady joined Peyton Manning and Fran Tarkenton as the only NFL quarterbacks to get off to 4-0 starts at least four times. The Super Bowl champions won their seventh straight game, including the playoffs last season. BRONCOS 16, RAIDERS 10 OAKLAND, Calif. — Chris Harris Jr. returned a fourth-quarter interception 74 yards for a touchdown and the Broncos overcame a shaky day from Peyton Manning. Manning was intercepted twice by 1998 draft classmate Charles Woodson and failed to lead the Broncos (5-0) to an offensive touchdown for the second time in five games this season. But Denver’s defense made sure it didn’t matter, getting a third defensive touchdown of 2015. Derek Carr threw for 249 yards and one touchdown for the Raiders (2-3), but was done in by the interception midway through the fourth quarter with Oakland in position for a possible go-ahead field goal. The Raiders added a late 50-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski following a 48-yard pass interference penalty on Bradley Roby, but Denver recovered the onside kick. Manning finished 22 for 35 for 266 yards, was sacked twice and had two interceptions. Denver ran for only 43 yards. CARDS 42, LIONS 17 DETROIT — Carson Palmer threw for three touchdowns, while Matthew Stafford was benched after throwing a third interception. The Cardinals (4-1) have a two-game lead in the NFC West. The Lions (0-5) have the dubious distinction of being the NFL’s only winless team and are off to their worst start since becoming the league’s only 0-16 team in 2008. Palmer was poised and efficient, completing 11 of 14 passes for 161 yards, with a 14-yard pass to Darren Fells, an 18-yard connection to John Brown, and a 2-yard strike to Larry Fitzgerald for scores. BEARS 18, CHIEFS 17 KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Jay Cutler led the Bears to a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns, the second an alert toss to Matt Forte with 18 seconds left. Kansas City lost star running back Jamaal Charles to a potentially season-ending right knee injury. Chicago (2-3) trailed 17-3 early in the third quarter when Charles went down while trying to make a cut. The preliminary diagnosis was a torn ACL and Charles will have an MRI exam Monday. The Bears quickly seized the momentum. After Robbie Gould’s second field goal got them going, Cutler led an 88-yard drive that he capped with a 22-yard strike to Marquess Wilson with 3:05 left. The 2-point conversion came up short, but the Bears defense responded by forcing a quick three-and-out. The Chiefs (1-4) tried a 66-yard field goal that came up short as time expired. EAGLES 39, SAINTS 17 PHILADELPHIA — Sam Bradford overcame two red-zone interceptions and threw for 333 yards and two touchdowns, Fletcher Cox forced two fumbles on sacks. Ryan Mathews and DeMarco Murray each rushed for touchdowns to help the Eagles (2-3) break out of their offensive slump. They snapped a three-game losing streak at home that dated to last season. Drew Brees had three turnovers leading to 17 points for Philadelphia, and the Saints fell to 1-4 a week after an overtime win against Dallas. Bradford and the rest of the offense struggled through the first quarter of the season. It looked like more of the same after he threw two INTs in the end zone, but he bounced back from the rough start. Philadelphia rushed for 186 yards. BILLS 14, TITANS 13 NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tyrod Taylor threw a touchdown pass, ran for another and even caught a pass in rallying the Bills. With their top two running backs and top wide receiver injured, Taylor ran for 77 yards as the Bills (3-2) snapped a five-game skid against Tennessee. Taylor ran for a 22-yard TD late in the third quarter after a 26-yard run that was Buffalo’s biggest play of the game. Taylor also scrambled for 24 more on third-and-23 from the Bills 7, jumpstarting an 80-yard drive he capped with a 2-yard TD pass to Chris Hogan. Taylor caught a 4-yard pass from Hogan to set up that TD. BUCS 38, JAGUARS 31 TAMPA, Fla. — Doug Martin ran for 123 yards and scored three touchdowns, helping Jameis Winston rebound from his worst pro performance. The Bucs (2-3) snapped an 11-game home losing streak that dated to December 2013, the same month the Jaguars (1-4) began an equally agonizing road skid that now stands at 12. Winston threw for 209 yards and one touchdown without an interception, redeeming himself after turning the ball over five times in a 14-point loss to Carolina last week. Blake Bortles passed for 303 yards and four TDs, but also threw an interception that set up a Bucs touchdown. The Jaguars gave up a 58-yard punt return that led to Martin’s 10-yard TD reception, and rookie Corey Grant lost a third-quarter fumble that defensive end Jacquies Smith returned 3 yards for a score that put Tampa Bay ahead for good.
