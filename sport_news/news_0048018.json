Very talented WR who has had a run of disappointing off field issues. — Bruce Feldman (@BruceFeldmanCFB) October 6, 2015 \nStar wide receiver D'haquille \"Duke\" Williams was kicked off of the Auburn football team on Monday night. The dismissal officially ended Williams' tumultuous time with Gus Malzahn's team. \nAccording to AuburnSports.com , Williams was involved in an altercation this past weekend at a local nightclub. This only adds to his checkered past at Auburn, which included being suspended for the Outback Bowl in 2014, and another suspension this past August. \nIn terms of talent, few match up with Williams' skill-set. During his first year with the Tigers , the Louisiana native had accrued 45 catches for 730 yards and five touchdowns. He was poised to become arguably the top-returning receiver in the SEC this year. However, off-the-field issues derailed a once-promising career.
