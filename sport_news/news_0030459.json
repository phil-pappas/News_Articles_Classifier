Today's question: Should the Reds trade Aroldis Chapman? \nCincinnati Reds relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman (54) delivers in the ninth inning during the MLB game between the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates, Saturday, Aug. 1, 2015, at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio. (Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar) \nIf you asked this question at a Society for American Baseball Research convention, you'd get a unanimous yes vote. If you asked this question to fans in the stands at Great American Ball Park in the ninth inning of a game with the Reds sitting on 10 strikeouts, you'd get a unanimous no vote. \nI've got to go with the SABR crowd here. I've enjoyed the Chapman show in the ninth, even if it's never meant free pizza for me personally. Chapman creates a buzz like no other pitcher in baseball. When he comes out of the bullpen door at Great American, it's an electric moment. Seeing someone throw 103 mph is pretty cool. \nBut to keep the electricity flowing at the ballpark on the river, the Reds are going to have to start winning again. Chapman is simply a luxury this team cannot afford. \nHe made $8.05 million in 2015. He's eligible for arbitration for the third time this offseason. I'd guess he'll make in the $12 million range in 2016. He's a free agent after the season. He can expect a better deal than David Robertson got from the Chicago White Sox last offseason. Robertson signed a four-year, $46 million deal. \nChapman had a great year – 33 saves in 36 chances, 1.63 ERA, 15.7 strikeouts per nine innings. But he threw a total of 66 ⅓ innings and went long stretches where he was unused. \nIf the Reds had stuck to the plan to make Chapman a starter, they may be looking at different set of circumstances right now. If Chapman had developed into an ace – a big if given his temperament and bouts with command problems – the Reds might not be rebuilding right now. \nBut that ship sailed a long time ago. Chapman is a hard guy to read, given the language barrier. But when my old boss, Angel Rodriguez, interviewed Chapman in Spanish at Redsfest in 2013, Chapman made it clear – very clear – that he didn't want to deal with the talk about starting anymore. \nSo the Reds are where they are: Rebuilding. Chapman will probably bring a package of prospects. The Reds have to do that. I think they will. In fact, an insider told me they will \"probably\" trade Chapman. \nA Washington Post story last week reported that the Reds and Nationals came close on the Chapman deal at the deadline, but the Reds wanted two of Washington's top five prospects. The Nationals traded for Jonathan Papelbon instead. The Nats would probably like a mulligan on that. \nBut if the Reds could get a package even close to that, they'll probably do it this offseason. \nSo who closes? J.J. Hoover looked up for it before his awful September. Michael Lorenzen or Jumbo Diaz could be candidates. Or the Reds could sign a bargain free agent. Atlanta got Jason Grilli for two years, $8 million. \nThe fact is there aren't likely to be a ton of games to save next year anyway.
