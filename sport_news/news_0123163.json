LOUIS (AP) - John Lackey outpitched old teammate Jon Lester, allowing two hits into the eighth inning, and rookies Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty each homered late as the St. Louis Cardinals cooled off the Chicago Cubs with a 4-0 victory Friday night in the opener of their NL Division Series. \nIn front of a standing room only crowd of 47,830 - the second-largest at 10-year-old Busch Stadium - thousands of Cubs faithful mixed into the red throng for the first postseason game between the two long-time rivals. \nGame 2 of the best-of-five series is Saturday. The Cardinals turn to lefty Jaime Garcia (10-6), who made 20 starts coming off risky thoracic surgery. Kyle Hendricks (8-7) makes his postseason debut for the NL wild-card winners. \nMatt Holliday had an RBI single in the first, giving St. Louis a lead after just three at-bats. Pinch-hitting, Pham homered off Lester and Piscotty had a two-run shot off Pedro Strop in the eighth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:24:31.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
