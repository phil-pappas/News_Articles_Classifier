The Czech saved one break point while serving for the match, and moves one step closer to reclaiming his title.\n\"My serve was working well today and in the tough moments I was able to help myself a lot with the serve,\" Berdych said after landing 86 percent of first serve points.\nHe next faces Marcos Baghdatis who needed three sets to overcome the eight-seeded Gilles Muller , 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-3.\nSecond-seeded Richard Gasquet came from one set down to beat Jeremy Chardy 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4).\nIn an all-French quarterfinal, it was the sixth-seeded Chardy who edged ahead before Gasquet responded in the second. He twice broke Chardy to lead 5-1 in the second before getting across the line in a tight third.\nGasquet was leading 5-3 in the decider and serving for the match, when two double faults handed Chardy a lifeline. The 28-year-old Chardy capitalized and forced a tiebreak. A trademark single-handed winner eventually put Gasquet into the last four.\n\"It was a little difficult, but I tried to fight and played very good in the tie-break and didn't make a mistake. It was a good match for me,\" Gasquet said.\n\"Jeremy has a very good serve and very good forehand so I need to play my best tennis to win.\"\nGasquet next faces American Jack Sock who beat Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-4.\nThat victory avenged his loss to Simon in Rome earlier in the year.\n\"I played more aggressive tennis in the middle of the second to get it back. With my style I try to come forward as much as I can and I was able to do that there at the end of the second,\" Sock said.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:22:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
