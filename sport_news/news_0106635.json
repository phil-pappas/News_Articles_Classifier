He said he called the 5-foot-7 officer “a midget.” Charges against Antic later were dropped.\nBut prosecutors presented a different theory, arguing Sefolosha, a Swiss citizen, acted entitled as he slowly departed the 1Oak nightclub. They said he eventually locked his arms in front of him to make it more difficult for arresting officers to put on handcuffs.\n“The police don’t get to tell the defendant how to play basketball,” an assistant district attorney, Francesca Bartolomey, said in her summation. “The defendant doesn’t get to say where the crime scene ends.”\nThe case is the second one involving high-profile athletes accusing New York Police Department officers of wrongdoing this year. On Wednesday, the city agency charged with investigating police misconduct substantiated claims by former tennis pro James Blake that an officer used excessive force in taking him to the ground and wrongly arresting him last month after mistaking him for a fraud suspect.\nSpiro, the defence lawyer, has suggested Sefolosha, who is black, was targeted because of his race. He pointed to surveillance video showing the white officer passing Antic, who also is white, and others as he demanded Sefolosha to move up the block.\nSefolosha had surgery on his leg and isn’t fully healed. He said he continues to undergo rehab and isn’t sure he’ll be ready to play when the NBA season starts Oct. 27.\n Hawks’ Sefolosha in ‘great pain,’ blames New York police for injuries\nAtlanta Hawks look set to soar next season after tough playoff exit\nMoses Malone: NBA great among league’s top rebounders\nTopics: Thabo Sefolosha Atlanta Hawks Comments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:05:43.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
