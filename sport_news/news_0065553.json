It just kind of went in.\" \nThere were three Westwood defenders in front of the box, but the ball bounced its way in. \n\"It feels pretty good,\" Bardes said. \"Especially with the tough time I’ve had physically. This was pretty clutch. It definitely takes a lot of concentration to move with both feet, but I have to use the left side [because she’s naturally left-footed]. I was just able to fake them out and get to the ball.\" \nThe victory improved Pascack Hills to 7-5-1, while Westwood dropped to 6-6-1. The teams played to a tie earlier this season. \n\"It was a back-and-forth battle,\" Pascack Hills coach Scott Ernest said. \"Erica is a difference-maker, making that play. She’s been doing that all season. Her timing here was phenomenal. We’re hoping that this gives us a home game in the states. We have to see.\" \nPascack Hills received solid play offensively and defensively from junior midfielder Allison Ernest, the coach’s daughter. \n\"She commands the middle of the field,\" Ernest said and joked, \"and if she doesn’t do that, then I won’t feed her when we get home.\" \nThe Cowgirls also were led by the play of junior goalkeeper Mackenzie Catherwood, who made six saves to earn the clean sheet, but none bigger than her final two of the day. \nTwice in the closing minutes, Westwood freshman forward Taylor Hirstius got behind the Pascack Hills’ back line to maneuver toward Catherwood. On one shot, Catherwood snared the ball between her legs. On the final shot of the game with two minutes left, Catherwood came out of goal to prevent a Hirstius breakaway. \n\"She has done a phenomenal job for us,\" Ernest said of his goalie. \"She did the right thing by coming out of the goal. She’s made all the right decisions for us.\" \nThe Cowgirls had the better of the action, collecting 12 shots compared with seven for the Cardinals. \n\"But we had quality chances,\" Westwood coach Eric Pfeifer said. \"We just didn’t get that final touch. Taylor has been clutch for us. She’s just beginning to scratch the surface.\" \nThe day belonged to the kid wearing the heavy bandages. \n\"I guess this all works,\" Bardes said. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:42:48.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
