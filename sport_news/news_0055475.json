However, in the following two sets, The Woodlands prevailed 25-21 and 25-23, taking the 2-1 lead. \nThe Lady Mustangs fought back to win the fourth set 25-23. Unfortunately, the Lady Stangs fell short in the fifth and deciding set, losing by a score of 15-8. \nKingwood received contributions from a variety of players including Effie Zielinski, who led the team with 19 kills, and Rebekah Nemeth, who racked up 16 kills. \nNicole Walters and Haley Hefner provided a strong setting tandem, contributing 25 and 24 assists respectively. Defensively, while several different players made excellent plays, the Libero, Lauren Ivey stood out, pacing the effort with 26 digs. Although it was a tough loss, Coach Ashley Earhart saw plenty to be happy about. \n“We came out with a lot energy and really competed. I liked the way we worked and bounced back to take the fourth set,” Earhart said. “I think we are starting to believe in each other. I think that confidence will certainly help us going forward.” \nThe Mustangs are now 3-3 in district play, and open the second half of district play at home against Oak Ridge on Tuesday.
