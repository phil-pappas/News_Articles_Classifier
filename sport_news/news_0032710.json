(AP) - Portsmouth's police chief is resigning.\nStephen DuBois announced Monday he will resign on March 28, 2016 after 22 years with the department.\nThe Portsmouth Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/1FyZX6k ) a separation agreement states DuBois is retiring voluntarily and will help the Police Commission find a replacement.\nThe agreement contains a clause that prevents the commission from discussing the circumstances surrounding DuBois' separation, beyond what is in the agreement and a press release.\nThe city and the commission also released any claims they have against DuBois.\nThe agreement is not effective for seven days. It must be approved by the City Council.\nDuBois is named in a suit filed by a former officer who says he was placed under a gag order for giving an interview last year about a now-fired police sergeant.\nInformation from: Portsmouth Herald, http://www.seacoastonline.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1FyZX6k"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:55:19.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
