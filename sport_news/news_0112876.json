Maybe an NFL official wouldn't have felt compelled to say on NFL.com -- and on game day, no less -- she was \"disappointed\" by Hardy's comments.\nMaybe Jerry wouldn't have had to drag Elizabeth Taylor into it.\nBecause in an otherwise dreary 30-6 beat-down Sunday by New England at JerryWorld, Hardy was one of the few highlights for the 93,054 fans who weren't periodically chanting \"Brady ... Brady ... Brady.\"\nPlaying for the first time in 19 games since domestic abuse charges put his career on hold, Hardy looked like he hasn't missed a day. Finished with two sacks, five tackles and five quarterback hits, two more of the latter than the rest of the defense combined. He gave the Cowboys a pass rush they'd lacked since Randy Gregory went down with a bad ankle and maybe the first since DeMarcus Ware decamped for Denver.\nFor a little perspective: In their first four games, the Cowboys had six sacks. They had five Sunday. What made this even more impressive was that the Patriots had given up only six sacks all season. One reason is that Brady gets the ball out so quickly. Averages 2.04 seconds, quickest in the league.\nFrom the first snap Sunday, though, Hardy was a thorn in Brady's side, if not a shoulder and a helmet. On the second play of the Patriots' second series, he left Solder on the ground, wrapped up Brady and planted him. Getting up, he curiously signaled a shush with a finger to his lips, which seemed a little odd, considering the home crowd and all.\nWhat was that all about?\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Hardy said.\nStanding at his locker after the game, Hardy answered questions for nearly four minutes. By my count, he answered \"next question\" or \"any more questions\" a total of six times. Among other things, he said he thought he had \"a good day.\" Also was \"grateful for the opportunity.\"\nDidn't really even get tired.\n\"I'm still excited,\" he said. \"I'm just excited to be in the locker room and looking at all you guys.\n\"Just the smell and aroma.\"\nNot sure what to make of that one, frankly, unless he just liked my cologne.\nFor that matter, I'm not sure what to make of anything Hardy says. One of his best friends in Carolina, Charles Johnson, defended Hardy's comments last week by telling ESPN, \"This is just the way he talks.\" Maybe so. Maybe he just doesn't get it. Maybe he's different, and expecting him to react the same as any rational person jeopardizing his career is missing the point.\nOr maybe he just doesn't care what you or I or anyone else thinks.\nMaybe he knows there was never any question about how well he can play, and that's what matters most to a lot of people, including the Cowboys' owner.\nWhen I asked Jerry if Hardy's play Sunday justified the criticism he's gotten for signing him, which includes a considerable amount in this space, he said he wouldn't go there. What Hardy needs to do, he said, is \"take his success on the field and show he's contrite and sensitive.\"\n\"Perception is everything,\" Jerry added, \"whether he did it or not.\"\nBoth a judge and an NFL investigation concluded he did, but that's old news. He served his suspension, and he's back. Business as usual in the NFL. Given the opportunity to begin making amends last week, though, he failed miserably. Jerry may not care so much, but the NFL does.\nGet this: The league actually has something called a \"first vice president of social responsibility,\" and her name is Anna Isaacson, and Sunday she told NFL.com, \"I couldn't disagree more with Greg Hardy's comments, and they do not reflect the values of the league.\"\nListening to Hardy's comments Sunday after his first game as a Cowboy, I couldn't tell you if he's learned any lessons, or if he gets it, or if he cares remotely about the \"values of the league.\" All I can tell you is at least he didn't say anything else offensive or stupid.\nAnd he was extremely polite.\n\"Thanks, guys,\" he said as a Cowboys official called it a wrap. \"Y'all have a great day, OK?\"\nTwitter: @KSherringtonDMN\nMore must-read Cowboys-Patriots coverage\nSherrington: Greg Hardy can play, but has he learned his lesson?\nGosselin: Cowboys painful to watch; season on brink\nMoore: Depressing!
