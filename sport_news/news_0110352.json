The results were published Oct. 14 in the journal Child Development .\nMaciejewski can't say for sure if the findings would apply to U.S. children, but suspects they might.\nExactly what drives the ups and downs was not part of the study, but Maciejewski said a number of factors might explain them.\nHormonal or brain-related changes in early adolescence might have an influence, she said. \"For instance, there are studies that indicate that cognitive control systems lag behind the development of emotional systems during that time, which makes adolescents hypervigilant to emotional cues but does not provide them with enough cognitive capacities to suppress their emotional reactions,\" she said.\nAlso, significant social factors coincide with puberty that may induce more fluctuations in negative and positive emotions, Maciejewski said. These include the transition to high school, conflicts with parents (curfews are one example), greater peer affiliation, or first romantic relationships. \"Additionally, during that time, they are still learning how to cope with their emotions,\" she said.\nGilda Moreno, a clinical psychologist at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, believes some of the moodiness is driven by a teen's temperament. \"People are born with personality and temperament,\" she said, noting some teens are naturally calmer than others.\nWhile the Dutch researchers found more variability in the happiness and sadness reported among girls than boys, that might reflect girls' greater tendency, in general, to express their feelings, Moreno said. \"Boys might have had the same ups and downs, but not talked about it as much,\" she speculated.\nParents can employ a number of strategies to stay sane through the ups and downs of adolescence, Moreno said. For instance, if your teen is rude and disrespectful, she advised stepping away and avoiding conversation, explaining why. Say something like: \"I can't talk to you right now. You are being disrespectful,\" she said.\nOnce everyone has calmed down, you can have a productive conversation, Moreno said. If moodiness centers on sadness or depression, parents should listen and gauge how seriously upset the teen is.\nMaciejewski agreed. \"It is best to listen carefully to their expressions of anger, fear and disappointment,\" she said. \"Staying in touch by exchanging and discussing experiences will help their teen not to drift away from contact with the parent, and at the same time help the teen to quietly think about the reasons and solutions for their mood changes.\"\nSometimes it helps to offer alternative interpretations of events, \"but only if the teen wants to listen to these,\" Maciejewski said. \"Only when mood swings stay high in late adolescence, professional help may be needed,\" she said.\nMore information\nFor more on coping with teen moodiness, visit the University of Alabama .\nCopyright Â© 2015 ", "external_links": ["http://www.pal.ua.edu/discipline/moody_teen.php", "http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:32:37.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
