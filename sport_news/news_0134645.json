Show Caption Previous Next \nLAWRENCE, Kan. - Thirty-eight young men recently moved into KU’s newest housing option, McCarthy Hall, designed especially for the men’s basically team. \n“It's a special space and it was designed especially for a particular population,” explained Diana Robertson, the director of student housing. \nAll sixteen basketball players are living in the state-of-the-art residence on scholarship. There’s room for 22 other male upperclassmen, too. \nTo live here, they are paying close to $10,000 per academic year. \n“It’s nice,” said KU junior Eddie Moore, “I certainly don't mind filling the quota here.\" \nMoore is not a basketball player, but a finance major, who said “it was just luck” he was able to move in to the new building. \nThe price tag is $11.2 million. It was paid for by private donations. \nSpecial features include biometric entry to each room, nine-foot tall shower heads, a barbershop, media center, and third-floor outdoor patio with a campus view. \nMoore said many students who don’t live in McCarthy Hall, always ask what it’s like. \nStudent Allison Stejskal said she was upset when she heard how expensive it was to build. \n“I took a housing survey over it last spring because they wanted to know what students thought of it and the price was ridiculous to me,” Stejskal said. “But I love our KU basketball team and I think they honestly deserve the best.\" \nKU is using the new space as a recruitment tool and pre-game gathering spot. \nRobertson said it offers prospective players high-end, apartment-style living that rivals other top-notch basketball schools like Kentucky and Louisville. \n\"There's absolutely a wow-factor involved. And the students, once they walked in, moved in, October 7th and 8th, there were a lot of ‘oohs’ and ‘ahhs’ and some ‘wows,’\" said Robertson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:22:41.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
