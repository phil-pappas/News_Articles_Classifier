The Aggies (0-4, 0-1 Sun Belt Conference) enter as 43-point underdogs to the No. 14 Rebels (4-1, 2-1 SEC). \n“Every skill kid on their team has incredible speed,” Martin said. “The quarterback, I think, runs exceptionally well. I think they’re a great example of what quality receivers look like. It’s the depth and speed that Ole Miss presents that’s hard for us to match, especially the depth.” \nThe Aggies played Florida in their season opener, a 61-13 road loss in which the Gators threw for 382 yards and four touchdowns. Martin has watched film of Florida’s 38-10 win against the Rebels last Saturday and strongly believes the Rebels are better. \n“Florida had their best day, and Ole Miss had an off day,” Martin said. “I think if they played 10 times, Ole Miss is going to get the best of that. We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re playing an elite football team. I think they’re a top-five football team.” \nThe Aggies won’t have starting quarterback Tyler Rogers, who broke his left thumb last Saturday and was scheduled to undergo surgery this week. He had completed 72 of 135 passes and seven touchdowns and averaged 243.5 passing yards per game. \nHis replacement will likely be redshirt freshman Nick Jeanty, who has attempted just four passes, including an interception, this season, or sophomore Andrew Allen, who the Aggies hope to redshirt after he played quarterback last year. \n“Nick has been a very intelligent quarterback,” Martin said. “He has a really good arm, he’s really accurate, he understands what we’re doing. We don’t have to cut the playbook back.” \nWhoever starts at quarterback will still be able to hand off to running back Larry Rose III, who has averaged 8.2 yards per carry and 144.8 yards per game. He ran for three touchdowns and 260 of the Aggies’ 303 rushing yards in last week’s 38-29 loss to New Mexico. \nRose, who credits his improvement from last season in part to his gaining 15 pounds in the offseason, came away impressed after studying film of the Rebels’ defensive line. \n“They’re big and they’re really fast,” Rose said. “Florida’s defense had a lot of speed, but I don’t think they have the size we’ll be facing against Ole Miss on Saturday. \n“You don’t have time to sit around and dance in the backfield. You’ve got to go north to south and get where you’re going. If not, you’ve got a whole swarm of them coming in a matter of seconds.” \nThe Aggies are used to challenging opponents such as Florida and Ole Miss after facing LSU, Minnesota, Texas and UCLA over the past three seasons. Martin expects this history to keep his team from being star-struck by its opponent or impacted by the crowd noise. \nHe takes a similar approach to the one used by Gene Hackman in the movie Hoosiers — Hackman’s character measured the height of the basket before a state championship game and told his players it was still 10 feet high in an effort to keep them focused — by telling the Aggies the field is still the same length and width everywhere they play. \n“We’re approaching it like any other game,” Rose said. “Keep our minds on the task at hand. We believe we have a chance to compete and come out with a ‘W.’” \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
