She also says the team's appearance policy required mandatory workouts, regular salon visits and tanning sessions, for which the dancers weren't reimbursed. \nAttorney Ryan Stephan said Thursday it's a \"clear-cut example of these women being exploited and taken advantage of.\" He said a handful of other former Bucks dancers have expressed interest in joining the suit, which was filed last week and seeks unspecified damages, including unpaid wages and overtime pay. \nBucks spokesman Jake Suski disputed the claims Thursday, saying they present \"inaccurate information that creates a false picture of how we operate.\" \n\"We treat all of our employees fairly, including our Bucks dancers, and pay them fairly and in compliance with federal and state law. We believe the lawsuit to be without merit and will contest these allegations in court,\" Suski said in a prepared statement. \nSuski noted that the team hasn't been served with the lawsuit, though Stephan says that should happen soon. \nMinimum wage in Wisconsin matches the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, but Stephan says dancers realistically earn only about half that. \nHerington's attorneys are seeking class-action status to represent current and former cheerleaders from recent years, and Stephan says a decision could come on that matter in the next few weeks. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:04:30.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
