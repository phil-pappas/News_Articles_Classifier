Indian cricket was shamed because of few angry fans at the venue during the 2nd Twenty20 International between India and South Africa. \nSpectators, upset with India's dismal batting performance, started throwing plastic water bottles onto the ground. It started at the end of India's innings as the hosts were bundled out for 92 in 17.2 overs. Rohit Sharma plays a shot during the 2nd T20I \nAgain, crowd trouble started with South Africa cruising towards victory. They needed 29 runs from 9 overs when bottles began to rain again. After just 2 overs, the incident repeated. Finally, match restarted and the Proteas completed a 6-wicket series-clinching victory with a game to spare. \nFormer India captain Sunil Gavaskar blasted the police personnel at the ground for not doing their duty as they were seen watching the match instead of taking action on erring fans. \n\"This is so so sad. (This has) spoilt the name of Indian cricket,\" Gavaskar said while commentating on the incident for Star Sports. \nSeveral other cricketers, current and former, took to Twitter to slam the ugly behaviour of the fans. India's Yuvraj Singh, VVS Laxman, Pragyan Ojha were among the many to criticise the Cuttack crowd. \nHere are some of the reactions from cricketers, via Twitter How would you like if people threw bottles at you after a bad day at office? Idiots are everywhere...some have made it to the ground #IndvSA — Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) October 5, 2015 Not an ideal scene for players n fans at #cuttack ,When 2 teams play,one wins n other loses, Support the sport, country automatically wins! — Mohammad Kaif (@KaifSays) October 5, 2015 Disgusting scenes in Cuttack....
