Despite the big win the English bow out after defeats to Wales and Australia meant the host nation was already eliminated before kick off. It was an encounter between two sides that failed to qualify for the quarter-finals. Stuart Lancaster’s lads dished out a commanding display and looked more of a dangerous side from the onset. It took just seven minutes for the hosts to register a try as Anthony Watson dotted over the line. T en minutes later, Nick Easter made it 14-3. In the 22nd minute, Easter crashed over the line for his second of the night to make it 21-3 with all three tries converted to that point.After the break, Jack Nowell picked up his second try of the night. The Roses were all but beaten with 10 minutes to go, however they continued to score tries for fun. In the 74th minute Nowell bagged his hat-trick with a superb try to ensure Lancaster’s lot win 60-3 on a night when Easter also crossed the white wash three times.Despite the victory, England fans will remain disappointed at their team’s failure to progress, as for Pablo Lemoine’s players, they will jet home with their heads held high with several credible performances at this year’s event.
