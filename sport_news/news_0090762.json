The Cardinals tried to be cautious with Carlos Martinez and Michael Wacha, but ultimately both have ventured far into inning regions never before reached.\nMartinez never had exceeded the 108 innings he pitched between the majors and minors in 2013, throwing just 104 1/3 innings mainly as a reliever last year. This season, he was terrific with a 14-7 record and 3.01 ERA, but on Sept. 25, at 179 2/3 innings, he suffered a shoulder strain and was ruled out for the rest of the season and playoffs.\nWacha never had thrown more than 149 2/3 innings he did in 2013 between the majors and minors. That dipped to 109 innings last year as he dealt with a shoulder ailment. He is at 181 1/3 innings after getting swatted for six runs in four innings Wednesday by the Pirates.\nWacha has yielded 21 runs in 24 innings covering five September starts, walking 18 against 19 strikeouts with seven homers permitted. In the first half – covering 17 starts – Wacha allowed seven homers and walked just 24 in 107 1-3 innings\nThe Cardinals are in the playoffs, but are trying to hold onto to first in the NL Central over the Pirates. Now Martinez is gone, and Wacha is struggling.\n  matt harvey ,  mlb playoffs ,  st. louis cardinals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:27:10.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
