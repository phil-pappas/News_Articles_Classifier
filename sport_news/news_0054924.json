I hope the children get what they need in the process.\"\nHensley, when reached Thursday, said he did not want to comment publicly beyond what was in his resignation letter.\nBoard member Linda Duncan said Thursday she was shaken by Hensley's resignation.\n\"The letter was painful for me to read, because I know it's true,\" Duncan said. She has long heard stories from JCPS employees about a top-down culture, low morale and a lack of trust, she said.\n\"You have people all over the district who are celebrating the truth,\" Duncan said. She said Hensley played a key role in JCPS and said she was disturbed that somebody who was still in the middle of his career felt he had no choice but to resign.\nDuncan said Hensley's resignation is just \"one more issue\" that is making her question management issues, and that she plans to bring it up during a Monday discussion among the board members about Hargens' formative evaluation.\n\"I look around and see all these holes of positions not filled and that does not make me feel good,\" Duncan said. \"I see all this experience leaving the district, and that does not make me feel good.\"\nHensley's resignation means Hargens' seven-member cabinet is less than half-filled.\nHargens is already on the hunt for people to fill three other cabinet positions: chief of communications and community relations and chief business officer — a position Hargens created months ago and has yet to fill.\n\"I was saddened to learn from Dewey of his decision to resign as chief academic officer of JCPS, effective Oct. 9,\" Hargens said in a statement released Thursday morning. \"Dewey has been an unwavering champion for the success of all students, including those who are excelling, those who are struggling, and those who have yet to discover their passion. I will miss his honest counsel and fierce determination.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nText: Dewey Hensley's JCPS resignation letter\nOthers around the state also expressed surprise at Hensley's resignation.\n\"This does not bode well for the function of the Jefferson County school system,\" said Richard Innes, a staff education analyst for the conservative think tank, the Bluegrass Institute. He said Hensley \"had a proven track record ... of getting the job done for disadvantaged children.\"\nBrigitte Blom Ramsey, executive director of the Prichard Committee, said Hensley's resignation is a loss for JCPS.\n\"It seems like things are a mess there today to put it mildly,\" Ramsey said. \"I've known Dewey to be an exceptionally strong and passionate champion for students.\"\nBoard chairman David Jones Jr. released a statement on behalf of the board thanking Hensley for his service and for his \"passionate and inspiring commitment to all of Louisville's children.\"\nJones acknowledged that \"feelings have been running high\" since the release of test scores earlier this month .\nCOURIER-JOURNAL\nKentucky School Test Scores 2015\nHe said that \"in an organization as complex as a school or a district, no one individual is solely responsible for success or failure.\" He added that there is \"no place for individual heroes or scapegoats\" and that a culture of teamwork and trust is essential.\n\"Building this culture ... is a very high priority,\" Jones said in the statement.\nHensley has expressed frustration in recent weeks, including in a \"three-page white paper\" he sent to school board members late last month. That paper talked about attacks to the \"cocoon of change\" he and his team had put around efforts to revamp JCPS' alternative schools system.\nThe \"white paper,\" which also included additional pages of his own thoughts at the end, was sent following a concern from board member Chris Brady that Hensley's alternative schools revamp wasn't completely thought out.\nBrady sent the email Sept. 17 asking for an update about the reorganization of the alternative schools after he'd received a message from a concerned teacher at Liberty High School.\nHensley's \"white paper\" and accompanying note charges that many JCPS schools don't want to deal with the most challenging students and that the current system gives students with emotional behavioral disabilities \"no home.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nRants and Raves | JCPS administrator resigns\nWhile the white paper laid out some suggestions for changes, such as creating permanent units in several schools for students with emotional behavioral disabilities, Hensley also spent a significant amount of time in the document talking about teacher pushback against change and calling out how the alternative schools have long been run, charging that \"in the past, these schools were run by people\" whom JCPS allowed to serve as \"benevolent dictators.\"\n\"It is amazing how many people in our alternative schools are connected to each other,\" Hensley wrote, \"in some cases in ways that even the least cynical of us would have to raise their eyebrow and question.\"\nA JCPS spokeswoman recently said that Hensley's Success Pathways approach to the alternative schools system is a \"process\" to \"really create a culture change\" and that changes can't happen overnight.\nSchool board member Chuck Haddaway said he knew Hensley had been frustrated, but didn't think the frustration stood out so much \"that I would have thought he was looking to leave.\" He called Hensley a creative, innovative and passionate person and said his departure leaves a big hole for JCPS.\n\"The question that anybody would ask is, 'Is this coincidental that there are so many cabinet positions out?' \" Haddaway said.\nTeachers' union president Brent McKim said that whoever replaces Hensley needs to be positive and collaborative with teachers, saying he hopes his union \"will be invited to the table as we interview for a new academic leader for the district.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nJCPS gets good, bad news on school scores\nHensley has been with JCPS off and on for years and has been chief academic officer since February 2012. He makes more than $163,000 a year.\nBefore becoming chief academic officer, he was an associate commissioner with the Kentucky Department of Education, having been tapped by the state after he helped turn around JCPS’ economically challenged Atkinson Elementary in his five years as principal there.\nHensley arrived in Jefferson County in 2003 and was principal of Bates Elementary before he went to Atkinson Elementary School.\nIn his time as JCPS chief academic officer, Hensley helped the state’s largest school district as it tried to turn around persistently low-achieving schools and implemented new state-mandated tests aligned to the Common Core.\nHe pushed for a third-grade reading pledge to have all JCPS students reading on grade level by the end third grade.\nAnd one of his catchphrases, “more effective instruction in more classrooms more of the time,” has become an oft-repeated phrase within the district whenever discussions about progress come up.\nJCPS Academic Officer resignation letter\nReporter Allison Ross can be reached at (502) 582-4241. Follow the Courier-Journal’s education team on Facebook at Facebook.com/SchooledCJ .\nJCPS’ open positions\nSuperintendent Donna Hargens’ cabinet has been decimated in recent months through retirements, resignations and non-renewals, leaving key positions open, in some cases for months.\nChief of communications and community relations : After Hargens declined in May to renew Helene Kramer’s contract , JCPS has been on the hunt for a new head of its communications division. The search has been going on for about five months now. Meanwhile, other jobs in that department are also waiting to be filled, notably after spokespeople Ben Jackey and Mandy Simpson separately resigned in May for other positions.\nChief of data management : Longtime JCPS administrator Bob Rodosky retired Aug. 1 . His position is still being advertised as JCPS looks for his replacement.\nChief business officer : Hargens announced this spring that she wanted to create a new chief position to oversee the human resources and finance departments. The job could pay up to $171,000 a year. Despite the job being posted originally in May , Hargens has not yet announced a person to fill that post. JCPS’ chief financial officer Cordelia Hardin would report to the chief business officer, but the chief financial officer position is also being kept as a cabinet-level position under the organizational chart.\nChief academic afficer : Dewey Hensley submitted his resignation letter, effective Friday, meaning JCPS must now find a new chief academic officer.\nHuman resources director : While not a cabinet-level position, this key job has also not been filled since Hargens opted in April not to renew the contract of Mark Rosen . JCPS has said it is waiting for the chief business officer position to be filled, so that new hire can choose the new HR director.", "external_links": ["https://www.scribd.com/doc/284060749/JCPS-Academic-Officer-resignation-letter", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/284060749/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed80646a848ec36fe77387f7c2f1860cfa4d5c7a/c=0-12-2996-1705&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/03/24/Louisville/Louisville/635628145628095378-0324HazlewoodElem013-DRL.JPG.jpg", "http://facebook.com/SchooledCJ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1dc812680a6d7255879f1a506286838d5413215/r=300/http/interactives.courier-journal.com/projects/kentucky-school-test-scores-2015/fbpic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f4beb15b0bd9be7912dd72d9cdde0f4b182e9ac/c=440-14-1804-1378/local/-/media/2015/03/24/Louisville/Louisville/635628145628095378-0324HazlewoodElem013-DRL.JPG.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/483388ed00d316fe75049fb75497f2e5351e94a5/c=662-0-2338-1676/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Louisville/Louisville/635792161331175270-Waggener00.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:10:07.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
