We just didn’t realize we’d be posting so many of them before the regular season even started.\nEarlier this month, we showed you a clip of Curry high-fiving his teammate Andre Iguodala after launching a three-pointer that hadn’t even gone in yet. Iguodala was actually on the Warriors ’ bench at the time, which made the play even more ridiculous than it was. And now, we have yet another clip of Curry and Iggy connecting on a crazy play.\nDuring the third quarter of Golden State’s preseason game against the Lakers last night, Curry decided to try something we hadn’t seen him do yet—an underhanded alley-oop pass from halfcourt. Because apparently, throwing regular alley-oops to Iggy from halfcourt has gotten old. If anyone else attempted this, we would probably rip them for being an idiot. But Curry tried it and, of course, he made it look so easy that we wouldn’t be surprised if he pulled this out again (and again) once the regular season starts.\nCheck it out in the clip above. This just isn’t fair!\n .\n[ via SB Nation ]", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/10/23/9601950/stephen-curry-underhanded-alley-opp-half-court-golden-state-warriors-andre-iguodala"], "published": "2015-10-23T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:46:35.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
