So whether that takes a few days, which obviously would be best-case, or a few weeks, we're trying to encourage him to just take your time.\nPlayer development coach Steve Nash said he felt badly for Kerr, who was the general manager when he played for the Phoenix Suns.\n\"Back issues are one thing, but spinal issues and spinal fluid, you're talking about the brain, and energy levels and systems, and that's scary stuff,\" Nash said. \"So he's going through a tremendous amount right now, and I wouldn't wish that on anybody.\n\"And if anybody can deal with it and cope with it, it's Steve. But I really think he's created an environment here that can run without him for a little while, and I think he should take as much time as he can because it's very, very serious what he's been through.\"\nWalton said Kerr \"just popped out to check on his crew.\"\n\"What he's dealing with, you don't have to deal with when you're flying to Cleveland at 2:30 in the morning and then to Minnesota the next night,\" Walton said.\n\"We didn't think he'd be around today, but we were in the meat of the competition part of practice. The way these guys are competing today, I'm not sure they even if they even knew he came in or not.\"\n(c)2015 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)\nVisit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1731840&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1731840", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1731840&h=Steve+Kerr+spotted+at+Warriors+practice+Friday"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:04:48.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
