The Sprint Cup driver has four victories this season in the second-tier series. \nDillon's night started with a scare when fireworks from a pre-race celebration landed near his back as he was leaning on his No. 33 Chevrolet after introductions. \nThe pole sitter was startled when fireworks landed on his car, causing him to jump out of the way along with his girlfriend Whitney Ward. He let out a wide smile after realizing what had happened. \nHis fire suit was slightly singed. \nKyle Busch led 102 laps before his night ended when he hit the wall after Kasey Kahne tapped him from behind with 50 laps remaining. \nSeries leader Chris Buescher finished seventh to maintain his points lead.
