Both coached at local high schools, Bradbury at Granite Hills and Jomaa at both Sultana and Victor Valley. The two squared off in a bitter rivalry in the early 2000s, with Jomaa’s Jackrabbits getting the better of Bradbury’s Cougars for two straight years. Now they’re working to build something at VVC. That’s no small task considering local high school players frequently graduate and look elsewhere to play college soccer, looking for an opportunity to move on from High Desert life and to find some autonomy from their parents. “Everyone in every area of America wants to get away,” said Bradbury, who coaches the men’s team. The problem for VVC is few talented athletes choose to move to Victorville to pursue athletic dreams. “We don’t get kids from Rancho (Cucamonga) who decide to move to the High Desert,” said Jomaa, now in his second year coaching the women’s team. He and Bradbury switched teams before last season. The change seems to be paying off this year. VVC’s women already have eight wins. With six matches to play, that’s already more than they’ve had in a season since a 10-win season in 2010. The turnaround wasn’t immediate, as they won just four matches last year. But after a year of hitting the recruiting trail, Jomaa feels he’s started to establish something. Heading out to high school games and practices helps, but Jomaa feels his biggest weapon is getting his players to four-year colleges. “I know it will help when I go and say all my sophomores went to four-year schools,” said Jomaa, who anticipates his six current sophomores will do so. Jomaa’s roster is packed with High Desert talent. Granite Hills graduate Maria Lara and Serrano grad Saida Aparicio were on the Daily Press All Area First Team in 2015 and 2014, respectively. They make up two parts of VVC’s three-pronged attack. The approach can be feast-or-famine at times, as was the case in VVC’s 4-0 loss to Rio Hondo College on Oct. 13, but there’s no doubt the scoring talent is there. The VVC men held Rio Hondo, ranked No. 1 in the state, to a 1-1 tie, showing plenty of fight against the Roadrunners. The Rams have already matched their highest win total of the previous 11 seasons. The last time VVC won nine matches was 2010 and the Rams have won more than five matches just twice in the past 11 years, in 2012 and 2009. The men’s team features a pair of players named to the 2015 Daily Press All Area First Team in Oak Hills’ Joel Coronel and Barstow’s Richie Ebel. They are a part of a VVC team that has been stellar defensively so far, allowing 16 goals in its first 14 matches. The wins are nice, and nobody doubts Bradbury’s competitive spirit, but the coach says getting his athletes scholarships is what drives him. He tells a story about Jose Velasco, a Silverado soccer player who graduated in 2009. After playing with VVC he picked up a scholarship to Kansas Wesleyan. At the signing ceremony, Velasco’s father came up to Bradbury and broke down crying while thanking him for what he’d done for his son. “What I love the most of coaching is that right there,” said Bradbury. “That is worth more than gold to me. That is my addiction. To make sure that these kids come here and get that experience from the community they grew up in and hope ultimately there’s some coach out there that wants my boys.” Many of VVC’s athletes arrive with plenty of physical gifts but with room for improvement. Bradbury breaks down a player’s development into three parts: Great training, great competition and mimicking great players. He encourages his players to watch the best soccer players in the world in their position to try to build up their soccer IQ. Bradbury combines that with his high-energy training to teach as much as he can as quickly as possible. “I’ve had athletes come up to me and say they’ve learned more in a year with me than they did in their entire career before this,” said Bradbury. “That’s a huge compliment.” It also speaks to the, at times, less than terrific youth soccer development available to players. Often times this correlates directly with the economy, Bradbury said. A good economy means more money to pay better coaches and get better training. “You’re starting to see it rebound now,” said Bradbury. “So in four, five years you’ll see a wave of more technically proficient players.” With both Jomaa and Bradbury in their comfort zones, the two can focus on the ultimate goal of getting athletes scholarships. The wins don’t hurt, though. Jacob Sundstrom can be reached at 760-951-6274 and jsundstrom@vvdailypress.com. You can follow him on Twitter @DPSundstrom.
