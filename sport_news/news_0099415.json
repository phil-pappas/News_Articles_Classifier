For the first time in t… Read more Related Links MLB Postseason Scoreboard \nCHICAGO • Tested and torn by injuries all season long, the Cardinals squeezed the most from a roster that when it reached the postseason had the least left to offer. \nShortly after 7 p.m. Tuesday, Cardinals manager Mike Matheny filled his eyes one last time with the party brewing at Wrigley Field, turned and stepped down the dugout stairs into the offseason. He has never had a season end this early as a manager. His club had played an unwilling role in the Chicago Cubs’ first ever postseason clincher at their 101-year-old ballpark, and for the fourth consecutive year his Cardinals had come up shy of their championship expectations. \nThe thundering Cubs got a tiebreaking homer from Anthony Rizzo in the sixth inning and an insurance blast from rookie Kyle Schwarber in the seventh to win Game 4 of the National League division series 6-4. The Cubs advance to their first National League championship series in 12 years by taking the series from their archrivals, three games to one. For the first time since 2010, the Cardinals will not be in the NLCS. The Cardinals were attempting to make history with a fifth consecutive NLCS berth, but as so often happens when annually chasing history, eventually you fall victim to it. \nAfter the game, Rizzo called the 100-win Cardinals “the best team in baseball.” \nThey weren’t at any point in the series. \n“We don’t set our sights in spring training and get into the postseason just to go home in the first round,” pitcher Adam Wainwright said. “That’s never what we’ve aspired to do. It’s painful when you lose for sure. I can’t get away from the things we overcame this year just to get here. But losing is losing. So it’s never easy. We left it all on the line, and we got beat.” \nCubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein likened the win to finally overcoming “older brothers who’ve been kicking sand in our face for 100 years.” \nThe Cardinals earned the best record in the majors this season despite lengthy absences from Wainwright, Matt Holliday, Matt Adams and a host of other contributors. On the eve of the postseason, catcher Yadier Molina tore a ligament and Carlos Martinez ended his season with a shoulder injury. General manager John Mozeliak took issue with the description of his team “limping” into October, yet they stumbled repeatedly during the NLDS. The Cardinals complicated their lack of health with a lack of execution and a series of hopeful and questionable bullpen moves by Matheny in the final two games of the series that the Cubs punished. \nThe Cardinals had a lead in each of the three games they lost. \nFor the fourth consecutive year of Matheny’s tenure their season ends with a three-game losing streak. It has happened one round earlier the past three seasons, from the 2013 World Series to the 2014 NLCS to Tuesday, to the Cubs. \n“There’s only one team that finishes this thing that is happy how it ended,” third baseman Matt Carpenter said. “If we lose in the NLCS, we still lose. We’re not World Series champions. That’s the ultimate goal. Losing is tough no matter when it happens. There is only one team that has the ending that it wants.” \nOne of the hitters inhibited by the Cubs throughout the series, Carpenter opened Tuesday’s game with a single, and then promptly scored on rookie Stephen Piscotty’s two-run homer. The game set up well for the Cardinals, who had veteran John Lackey pitching on short rest against the Cubs’ Jason Hammel. On Monday the Cardinals had scored six runs and lost for the first time all season long, yet felt encouraged by the gush of offense and their track record against Hammel. The three hitters in the middle of the Cardinals’ order entered 22 for 52 (.423) against the Cubs’ righthander. \nAfter Piscotty’s homer, the lineup went silent, strikeouts mounted. \nCarpenter, Holliday and Jhonny Peralta combined to go eight for 47 (.170) in the series with more strikeouts (14) than total bases (12). Holliday, trying to play with a quadriceps muscle twice torn during the season, had two singles in 16 at-bats. The Cardinals had 13 extra-base hits total against the Cubs, and six of them were by rookies, including three homers from Piscotty. The Cardinals’ lineup produced eight home runs but had difficulty sustaining rallies because in 36 percent of their 133 at-bats, they struck out, including 15 times Tuesday. Meanwhile the Cubs overwhelmed them with power, taking advantage of the wind blowing out two consecutive days at Wrigley. \n“We had the same conditions, the same stadium,” Matheny said. “We could have made it happen, and we came up just a little short.” \nThe Cardinals lost their 2-0 lead quickly, on back-to-back pitches from Lackey. In the second inning, Hammel, of all hitters, poked a spinning cutter up the middle for an RBI base hit. Instead of getting the pitcher to comply for the third out of the inning, Lackey had to face free-swinging infielder Javier Baez. A pitch after Hammel’s single, Lackey left a fastball up and over the outside edge of the plate. Baez put it in the seats for a three-run homer and a 4-2 lead to dent Lackey’s three-inning outing. \nAs the game plunged into the bullpens, the Cardinals eventually answered with two runs off Cubs relievers in the sixth. Tony Cruz started at catcher because Yadier Molina couldn’t grip a bat Tuesday with his torn ligament, and he poked an RBI double down the right-field line to save the inning with two outs. Pinch-hitter Brandon Moss ripped a single to right field that tied the score and allowed Cruz to attempt to score from second. From right field Jorge Soler threw a dart home that arrived just as Cruz did. The Cardinals’ backup catcher’s lead foot bounced over the plate but not on it as Miguel Montero applied the tag. \nWhat could have been a lead was only a tie. \nTo hold it, Matheny went to the reliever who was called on the most of any reliever in the majors, lefty Kevin Siegrist. Siegrist allowed one of the game-turning homers in Monday’s loss, and again he would have to face Rizzo. The Cubs’ first baseman has defied stereotype with a better average and a solid slugging percentage against lefties. Siegrist, likewise, had been better against righthanded batters all season. Matheny said he went to Siegrist “no matter what his splits say.” Rizzo turned on them. \nHis solo homer broke the tie and essentially sent the Cubs to the NLCS. Schwarber’s homer off Siegrist in the next inning cleared the scoreboard in right field on its way to Sheffield Avenue. In the span of 10 batters, Siegrist allowed four homers. \nAll to lefthanded batters. \nWe “talk all the time about the cleanliness of a game,” Mozeliak said. “Who plays it clean. Who doesn’t make mistakes. Unfortunately, in these four games there were times we did. Whether it was a pitch. Whether it was a play. And they capitalized.” \nThe Cardinals got the tying run to the plate in the seventh inning and then again in the ninth inning but couldn’t get it done. Even in the fourth inning, when the Cubs allowed two baserunners – one by walk, another with an error – the Cardinals struck out three consecutive times to end the inning. \nThe Cubs didn’t let a chance like that pass without pop. \n“Pardon the pun here, but the playoffs are not about who can outscore who,” said outfielder Jason Heyward. “It’s about who can limit who to fewer runs, like we played all season, like we won 100 games doing. They put up more runs than we did but they won because they were able to stop us from scoring more runs.” \nThe Cardinals’ season ended where it began,on a cold April night at Wrigley. In the months since, the Cardinals proved the better team over six months, but with each passing week the Cubs improved. They added Kris Bryant. They added Schwarber. They added swagger. The Cardinals became defined by what they were missing. They lost Wainwright. They lost Holliday. They lost Molina. Asked several times if the balance of power in the NL Central had shifted Tuesday night, Wainwright asserted: “We’re not going anywhere.” \nThey have a winter to regroup. \nA season defined by Next Man Up gave way to Nothing Left. \n“I have no regrets with this club, and that’s the one message that I made sure they heard,” Matheny said. “This team never let off the throttle, and that’s hard to do through a season that’s this long. They were grinding right to the end and always up for a good fight. I think that’s what our fan base expected. I think we delivered. We just came up short when we needed in October.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:44:14.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
