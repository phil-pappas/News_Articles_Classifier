Looking around, it reminded you of the spring game pretty much,” Fournette said. “But the coaches told us, no matter who’s here, we have to play.” \nThe missing 60,263 for 102,321-seat Tiger Stadium missed Fournette becoming the quickest LSU back in history to reach 1,000 yards in a season through just five games. He has 1,022 on the season for the Tigers (5-0 overall, 3-0 Southeastern Conference). South Carolina fell to 2-4 overall and to 0-4 in the SEC. \nIt was LSU’s smallest crowd in Tiger Stadium since drawing 33,728 on Sept. 28, 1957, in the season opener for a pre-Bear Bryant Alabama team that was 2-17-1 the previous two seasons while the Tigers were coming off three straight losing seasons. \nBut virtually all of those 42,058 tickets were sold just since Wednesday when the SEC and South Carolina announced that the game would be moving from its original site in Columbia, South Carolina, to Tiger Stadium because of historic flooding throughout that state. \nThe more than 68,000 LSU season ticket holders and all those who previously purchased tickets for the game in Columbia had to buy new tickets for this game, which was billed by LSU and the SEC as South Carolina’s home game. And LSU will give all ticket and concession revenue to South Carolina. LSU also held a moment of silence for South Carolina flood victims before the game, did not wear white jerseys for the first time at a home SEC game since 1996, and LSU’s band played South Carolina’s fight song before the game and its alma mater after. “Geaux Gamecocks” was quickly added to billboards around town as well and at the stadium. LSU fans even cheered for South Carolina before the game. \nSouth Carolina safety D.J.

Harris, the sophomore from Bossier City, had his best day as a Tiger, setting career highs with 18 completions, 28 attempts and 228 yards with two touchdowns. \n“Everyone in the area was very welcoming,” South Carolina quarterback Perry Orth said. “It was nice to see the fans cheering us on.” \nFournette even announced in an ESPN interview after the game that he would be auctioning off his game jersey to the highest bidder with proceeds going to South Carolina flood victims, pending NCAA approval, and an official NCAA tweet said that could be done. \nAnd the Gamecocks made a game of it briefly as it cut it to 14-10 in the second quarter on a 96-yard kickoff return by Rashad Fenton. After Fournette’s 87-yard touchdown run for the 24-10 lead in the third quarter, Harris connected with wide receiver Travin Dural on a 62-yard touchdown pass for a 31-10 lead with 6:29 to go in the third quarter. \nIt was just LSU’s day. Harris’ intended receiver on the touchdown was tight end DeSean Smith, whom he overthrew but Smith tipped it and Dural got it. Backup tailbacks Darrel Williams and Derrius Guice added short touchdown runs in the third and fourth quarters around 36-yard and 43-yard touchdown passes by Orth in the third quarter. \nLSU running back Darrel Williams (34) scores a touchdown during the second half of an NCAA college football game against South Carolina in Baton Rouge, La., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015.

LSU inhospitably held the Gamecocks to 74 rushing yards on the day on 20 carries while the Tigers gained 624 yards of total offense — their most in an SEC game since getting 630 in a 42-13 win over Ole Miss in 1987. \n“That’s Tiger Stadium. That’s our home venue,” LSU coach Les Miles said. “It doesn’t make any difference how you cut it. It doesn’t matter what we wear. It’s just very difficult for an opponent to come in and pretend you’re the home team.” \nSouth Carolina coach Steve Spurrier, who came in with a 7-3 record in Tiger Stadium as a head coach and former Florida quarterback, did not feel at home. He left 0-4 in the SEC for the first time in his career. \n“LSU was just too big, stronger, tougher and maybe smarter than us,” Spurrier said. “I don’t know if we would have played them at home it would have been any different. I just get frustrated watching our guys. Their guys must have broken eight tackles on their long runs. Our guys go in there and just fall on the ground. We are a struggling bunch.” \nGuice finished with 161 yards on 16 carries. Dural caught four passes for 109 yards, and Dupre had six catches for 74 yards after each had a pair of drops last week. \n“It was weird not having many people in the stadium,” Dupre said. \nIt will be closer to 102,321 when No. 11 Florida plays at LSU at 6 p.m. Saturday on ESPN. \n“I didn’t look, but they sounded just like 100,000 to me,” Miles said. “It was very much like Tiger Stadium. All in all, we’re glad to be 5-0 and look forward to playing Florida in the next event.” 2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/2015/10/10/lsu-beats-south-carolina-45-24-spring-game/73756316/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:09:11.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
