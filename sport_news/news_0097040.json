Veteran offspinner Harbhajan Singh was dropped. \nThe BCCI selection committee, led by Sandeep Patil, on Monday (October 19) announced a 16-man Indian Test squad for the first 2 matches of the 4-game home series against South Africa. Ravindra Jadeja is recalled \nVirat Kohli will lead the Test side against South Africa. This is the first home series for him since taking over the reins from MS Dhoni, who quit Tests in December last year. \nThe 26-year-old Jadeja, who is the leading wicket-taker in the ongoing Ranji Trophy with 24 scalps (4 five-wicket hauls) from 2 games for Saurashtra at an outstanding average of 8.24, has returned on sheer weight of performance. He has also hit 2 half centuries. \nJadeja has made a comeback to the Indian team after 4 months. He last played in a ODI in Bangladesh on June 18. \nThree members of the Test squad which won the series in Sri Lanka on September 1, have been dropped. They are Harbhajan, Karun Nair and Naman Ojha. Jadeja, Murali Vijay and Wriddhiman Saha have taken their places. With the latest omission from the team, Harbhajan's Test career seems to be over. The 103-Test spinner, however, is part of the ODI squad. \nThis will be the first Test series in India since the retirement of batting legend Sachin Tendulkar. India have not played a Test at home since November 16, 2013. \nTendulkar retired from international cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th and final Test at his home ground, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.
