But they needed to win three straight games in the division series with the Rangers, and they did just that. Now, following a Game 5 win at home — a gem by Marco Estrada on Wednesday — the Jays need two road wins at Kauffman Stadium to advance to their third World Series.\nThe fact they are 4-0 in 2015 in elimination games is encouraging. So is history.\nThere have been 165 best-of-seven series in playoff history —106 for the World Series and 59 for the AL and NL championship series, which went from five to seven games in 1985. And of the 18 teams that have come back from a 3-1 deficit to force a Game 7, 13 of those have won the series.\nBy the way, the record for wins in elimination games in one post-season was set by the 1985 Royals, who came back from 3-1 down against the Jays in the ALCS, and then again against the Cardinals in the World Series. Toronto could tie that mark with two wins in Kansas City.\nOf the 18 previous series in which a team came from a 3-1 deficit to force a Game 7, here are five of the greatest:\n2004 ALCS: Boston vs. N.Y. Yankees\nIn manager Terry Francona’s first year with the Bosox, they dropped the first three games to the Yankees and everyone assumed the Curse of the Bambino would continue. Everyone except the Red Sox. It remains the only time a team has overcome a three-game deficit in post-season history. The Sox walked off wins in 12 and 14 innings in Games 4 and 5, with David Ortiz delivering a home run and a single. They won two games in New York to make history and advance to play the Cardinals.\n1968 World Series: Detroit vs. St. Louis This was supposed to be a series pitting the two Cy Young Award winners — the Tigers’ Denny McLain, with 31 victories, and the Cards’ Bob Gibson, with a fabulous 1.12 ERA. Instead, it turned into the Mickey Lolich show. The Cards gained a stranglehold with Gibson winning Games 1 and 4 but Lolich, the portly lefthander, won Game 5 and came back to win Game 7 on just two days rest, beating Gibson 4-1. The series received credit for bringing the city together and helping defuse Detroit’s racially explosive summer as it turned to fall.\n1979 World Series: Pittsburgh vs. Baltimore\nThe “We Are Family” Pirates squeaked by Montreal on the final weekend of the season and beat Cincinnati in the NLCS. Game 1 was snowed out in Baltimore. The Orioles split at home, then took the first two games in Pittsburgh to set themselves up for victory. But Willie (Pops) Stargell, the head of the Pirates family, would not allow it. In Game 7, Stargell stepped up in the sixth inning and delivered a two-run homer for a 4-1 win and the comeback was complete.\n2003 NLCS: Florida vs. Chicago Cubs\nThe Cubs were battling a curse of their own — the Billy Goat Curse from 1945, still Chicago’s last World Series appearance, when a tavern owner and his goat were kicked out of Wrigley Field. In 2003, with Chicago leading 3-1, the Marlins’ Josh Beckett shut out the Cubs to take the series back to Wrigley. Chicago’s Mark Prior and Kerry Wood, who had not lost back-to-back games at any time during the regular season, were set to start. At a key moment in Prior’s Game 6, as Moises Alou leaped for a foul ball in the stands, a fan named Steve Bartman reached out and prevented him from making the catch. A potential win became a loss and Game 7 turned into a disaster. Bartman has been in hiding ever since and the Cubs are still without a title.\n1992 NLCS: Atlanta vs. Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh battled back from a 3-1 deficit to even the series in Atlanta. The champagne was on ice and the Pirates’ lockers were covered in plastic for the celebration. But the Bucs blew a two-run lead in the ninth, with Sid Bream lumbering home on a Francisco Cabrera single and beating Barry Bonds’ throw. The loss sent Pittsburgh into a 21-year tailspin of sub-.500 ball until the arrival of catcher Russell Martin. The Canadian catcher has now helped the Jays end their 22-year playoff drought.\nBaseball fans learn lessons of hope from history.\nMore on thestar.com\nArgos defiant prior to relocated game in Hamilton against Alouettes\nRaptors’ Patrick Patterson shrugs off slow pre-season start", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:56:15.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
