It seemed like a nice international signing for the Giants. Martinez, 20, has been likened in body type to former Braves outfielder Andruw Jones, who had a successful major-league career.\nAdChoices General manager Bobby Evans even said the day after the season ended that he hoped to get Martinez's signature on a contract soon.\nNow, it appears Major League Baseball will decide if Martinez really does belong to the Giants.\nAccording to this story by Jon Heyman of CBSSports.com , baseball officials will rule whether Martinez had a binding deal with the Giants, despite word that Martinez and his representatives had backed out of a verbal agreement to sign for $500,000 more with the Cubs.\nOne complicating factor, Heyman said, is that Martinez appears to have more than one representative speaking for him in addition to his agents in the United States, the well-regarded Beverly Hills Sports Council.\nHeyman reported that baseball hopes to resolve the issue as early as this week.\nHenry Schulman is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
