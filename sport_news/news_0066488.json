The Silver Streaks posted a team score of 323 to finish 51 strokes ahead of runner-up Peoria Richwoods (374) and 58 shots in front of third place Moline (381). Galesburg coach Brad Gross was beaming from ear-to-ear after the final participant scores were posted. \"They all came together today,\" he said. \"Even though we play a lot of our in season meets here, there's always been the Bracken curse where we score well in the nine hole duals but run into problems when we play 18 hole rounds. Today was not the case.\" All six Galesburg players carded scores below 90 paced by medalist Taylor Nesselroad who posted an even par 71 and now holds the top two 18-hole scores in girls play in the school's history. \"She's so talented,” Gross said of his junior. Nesselroad finished four shots ahead of Moline's Megan Medinger (75) in the individual scoring race. Galesburg’s Kirsten Osborn finished in 5th place with an 83, followed by Alexis Bush in sixth with an 84 and Rylee Chockley took seventh at 85. Jenna Heck finished in a tie for ninth with an 86 and Jessica Sparks was next with an 87 for the Streaks. “I’m so proud of the team. They all played so well,” Nesselroad said. “We're just like a big family. “The 71 is the best round I've ever shots here (Lake Bracken). My putting was exceptional. I made a lot of those that I thought I couldn't.\" The best may have been on the par-5 15th hole. \"I got to the green in three but was upset with my approach shot that left me a long way from the hole,” Nesselroad said. “But I looked it over, hit it and it went in from 40 feet for a birdie.\" That birdie was one of three over the final six holes that let Nesselroad survive two early double bogeys on the back nine and post a 1-over 36 on the back to go with three birdies and two bogeys on the front side for a one under 35 and her 71. \"When we made the turn, I lost a little focus double bogeying 10 and 12 but I quickly got things refocused and played very well the last six holes,\" Nesselroad said. “What the girls did today was just awesome,” Gross said. “They picked a good time to get things rolling with the Sectional in Bloomington coming up next Monday.\" Rounding out the team scores behind the top three teams that qualified for sectional play, were Dunlap (449), Sterling (454), Lockport (465), LaSalle-Peru (490) and Rock Island (515).
