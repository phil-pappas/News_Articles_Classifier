TMZ is reporting that Odom is in critical condition at Sunrise Hospital, and that he is suffering from heart issues and his kidneys are shutting down. Sunrise Hospital has not released any official statement about these reports. The Former Los Angeles was driven to the hospital by ambulance after being found unconscious yesterday afternoon around 3:15 . Emergency workers attempted to fly him to the hospital by helicopter, but he was too large to safely transport by air. Odom had been staying at a brothel for three days just outside of Pahrump known as Love Ranch. Brothel owner Dennis Hof spoke with news 3, and described the moment that his employees walked into Odom's room and found him unconscious. \"When we called 911, -- immediately called 911 -- they said roll him over on his left side,” Hof told News 3. “He started throwing up all kinds of stuff. Foaming, and throwing up all kinds of things.” Hof said neither the girls at the brothel nor ambulance workers saw any illegal drugs in the room, and said that the only thing he knew was Odom had been taking excessive amounts of herbal viagra -- which can lower blood pressure. Hof also told News 3 that before being found unconscious he appeared to be fine, that he was sleeping, and could be heard snoring. Odom spent the best years of his career in Los Angeles, winning two championships in 2009 and 2010, and the NBA'S sixth man of the year award in 2011. He last played in the NBA in 2013, and recently saw reality tv fame through his four-year marriage to Khloe Kardashian. Kardashian filed for divorce in 2013. News 3 also spoke with Fareed Samad, a basketball trainer who has worked with Odom. Samad described Odom's life over the past few years as an emotional roller coaster. “The last really big thing him and his ex wife seeing each other resolving some things. It was not good. It was bad.” Samad said. “He gets a lot of calls and texts. I don't know if it put him over the edge. Something is not right.” There are reports that the Kardashians are at Odom's side, and photos have been released of members of the family coming in and out of the hospital. — Craig Fiegener (@CraigNews3LV) October 14, 2015 Reverend Jesse Jackson visited the hospital Wednesday morning, and confirmed to the media that Lamar Odom is unconscious, and not talking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:30:01.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
