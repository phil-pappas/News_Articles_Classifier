Rodgers' two-point conversion pass to Nick Reyes made it 21-8. \n\"I saw a big lineman, and Anthony Richardson got a great block,\" Streater said of his interception return. \nSenior Brad Hawkins, a Michigan recruit, scored two touchdowns for No. 4 Camden (3-2, 2-1). \nHawkins scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak in the first half and added a 3-yard touchdown catch with 1 minute, 1 second to play in the game. \nCamden took a 2-0 lead early in the game when Jamal Holloway, a Syracuse recruit, tackled Rodgers for a safety. \nStreater cut Camden's lead to 8-7 with a 66-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. \n\"I had open field, and I saw Brad [Hawkins] out of the corner of my eye,\" Streater said. \"I heard somebody breathing and said, 'Uh-oh, I better keep going.' \" \nThe start of the game was delayed 45 minutes by strong thunderstorms. And there was some confusion when the scoreboard clock stopped working in the fourth quarter. \nBut the Irish made the big plays to seize the high ground in the division and strengthen their position in both the battle for a Non-Public 3 playoff berth and the top 25 rankings. \nStreater said the rivalry with Camden was \"incredible.\" \n\"They're such a good team,\" Streater said of the Panthers. \nAsked what that says about Camden Catholic, Streater replied: \"We're great.\" \nCamden 8 0 0 8 - 16 \nCamden Catholic 0 7 0 14 - 21 \nC: Safety \nC: Hawkins 1 run (pass fail) \nCC: Streater 66 run (Brian Cooey kick) \nCC: Tyree Rodgers 8 run (Nick Reyes pass from Rodgers) \nCC: Streater 43 interception return (kick fail) \nC: Safety", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:42:22.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
