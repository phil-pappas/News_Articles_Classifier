Good luck !!\" \nAmelia was released by Milan in the summer of 2014 and has not had a long-term contract since. \nHe had a short term deal with Perugia at the end of last season, but never made a first-team appearance. He will now train with Chelsea with the view to a contract. \nJose Mourinho is keen to have another goalkeeper as back up to Asmir Begovic, who is the only experienced goalkeeper in the squad that is currently fit to play. \nFirst-choice Thibault Courtois is out until December with an injury, while Jamal Blackman, who has deputised on the bench, is 21 and has never made an appearance for Chelsea.
