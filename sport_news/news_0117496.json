Jon Heyman of CBS Sports reported the decision is \"mutual.\" He also noted an official announcement is expected later Thursday and the Miami Marlins are interested in the six-time All-Star to potentially take over the same role. Mattingly reportedly wants to continue managing, but he had lost long-term support in L.A. As a result, the sides have decided to go their separate ways, according to Heyman . Ramona Shelburne of ESPN reported the Dodgers had offered Mattingly a contract extension over the weekend, but the lingering uncertainty caused both parties to instead terminate the relationship. Dylan Hernandez of the Los Angeles Times reported the Dodgers will pay Mattingly's salary for the 2016 season. As has been the case since the Dodgers' new ownership group took over in 2012, drama has been following the team around. That's expected to some extent with payroll over $270 million in 2015. Mattingly has been on the hot seat for two years, dating back to 2013 when the club got off to a slow start. Ownership showed faith in him after the Dodgers made the playoffs last year by giving him a three-year contract extension in January. At the time, then-general manager Ned Colletti praised the job Mattingly had done during his tenure, per Ken Gurnick of MLB .com: I think he's done a great job here. The last three years in the organization have been historic in a lot of different ways. We kept the baseball team steady and the credit goes to a lot of people, including the man who runs the dugout and the leader of the guys. This is well-deserved. He gets better and better. Changes came to the Dodgers once again after they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2014 National League Division Series. Colletti remains with the organization but lost his duties as general manager because Andrew Friedman jumped from the Tampa Bay Rays to Los Angeles as the president of baseball operations.
