(AP) â€” The Oakland Raiders have signed return specialist Walter Powell off the practice squad of the Buffalo Bills.\nPowell's agent Brian McLaughlin said on his Twitter account Friday that Powell is joining the Raiders' active roster.\nPowell played four games for the New York Jets last year. He returned eight kicks for 233 yards and 12 punts for 48 yards. He was cut before the season and joined Buffalo's practice squad.\nThe Raiders had been seeking a full-time returner. Starting safety TJ Carrie injured his chest returning a punt two weeks ago and kick returner Taiwan Jones is nursing a foot injury.\nOakland had an empty roster spot after waiving safety Keenan Lambert on Thursday.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
