The Wildcats responded the next time they stepped on the field and delivered a 1-0 win over Cape Elizabeth last Saturday on Senior Night. York is now 5-6-2 on the season. “It was a huge win for us,” Masi said. “It was great for the seniors to get that. Looking at our season as a whole, we had two signature wins that we are happy with. We aren’t over the moon, but we are proud of the season we’ve had.” No one had a bigger game than senior Matt Arsenault, who scored the game’s only goal in the fourth minute of the match. It was just the second varsity goal for Arsenault. The goal was scored when Masi still had all his eight seniors out on the field. “Everything came together on that one,” Masi said. “We have some seniors who don’t see the field very often and I think it was great for them to be out there when the goal was scored. It was extra special for Matt (Arsenault). He plays in every game, but for him to score a big goal like that, I think he’ll remember that one for awhile. The other seniors who were honored before the game included captains Chris D’Aquila and Malcolm Hughes, as well as Ian Hovde, Thacher Parenteau, Santiago Eraso, Jack Rohrer, Caileb Stanley, and Spencer Goulette. “What stands out to me about this group the most is the leadership and the character they have,” Masi said. “They have been great to work with, an awesome group. They are great students and great kids. It’s been awesome working with them.” D’Aquila was a four-year varsity player for Masi. “Chris was getting into every game as a freshman and he was such a small kid,” Masi said. “You couldn’t wipe the smile off his face. He was so happy being on varsity. It’s been interesting to see him evolve. He has been the heart and soul of this team.” Hughes came up to varsity late in his freshman season for the playoffs. “He’s such a great, diligent kid,” Masi said. “He’s always done what we’ve asked him to do. Both he and Chris have been great leaders, great captains.” Masi said Goulette, a starting midfielder, was a player who got better each year. “He has shown such consistent growth,” Masi said. “He continued to get better each year. As a freshman, he wasn’t on my radar as a kid who could be a starter for me down the road.” One final regular season game The Wildcats were scheduled to end the regular season on Tuesday at Greely, which entered the game with a 7-3-3 record and was ranked third in the latest Heal point standings. The Rangers handed the Wildcats a 3-0 loss in York earlier this month. “It’s good to have one more really hard battle against a true contender,” Masi said. “It will show us the level we need to get to. You don’t want to go two weeks without playing a team of that quality.” Dangerous playoff team Last Saturday’s win over Cape Elizabeth vaulted the Wildcats into the sixth spot with a 5-6-2 record. Masi believes the Wildcats will host a preliminary round on Saturday no matter what happened in Tuesday’s match with Greely. “We can put together a plan against the best teams that we will be hard to beat,” Masi said. “We proved that this year with our win over Falmouth. I think we are the team that nobody wants to play. We always show well in the playoffs. We are going to give somebody a battle.” Not as nervous Masi is more relaxed as he prepares for his sixth appearance in the playoffs “There are far less nerves,” Masi said. “I am looking forward to taking this team to the playoffs. We aren’t the favorites, not at all, but I really want that playoff upset. I am looking for that big playoff win. Teams with character get those wins, and this team has character. I am excited.” By Jay Pinsonnault", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:54:30.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
