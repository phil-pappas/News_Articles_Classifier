Sophomore Lauren Thompson had 18 kills for Har-Ber, which will play at Harrison Thursday in a final tuneup for the Class 7A state tournament at Conway. \n\"It was fun tonight to see the girls go out and play with confidence,\" Har-Ber coach Shyrah Schisler said. \"It was good for the seniors, especially, who bought into the program when I came here as a coach. That's hard. But they've done such a fantastic job of buying in.\" \nKlaire Trainor had 15 kills for Har-Ber while Emily Williams added 39 assists and Emily Doss 12 digs. \nHar-Ber (24-5-2, 10-4) controlled the action against Springdale, which earned its first conference victory over Fort Smith Northside last week. Desiree Mack provided most of the offense for the Lady Bulldogs (8-21, 1-13), who beat Har-Ber in a set earlier this year at Springdale. \nMack finished with 17 to lead the Lady Bulldogs. \n\"We faced a lot of challenges this year, \"Springdale High coach Kylie Moad said. \"We lost seven seniors tonight but we have a good sophomore class to build on for next year. There's been games where we've let up, but I thought we fought tonight to the end.\" \nDesiree Mack and Klaire Trainor traded kills at the outset of the first set Tuesday. Mack put Springdale ahead 8-5 before Trainor countered with a kill and Paige Williams followed with an ace to even the match. \nHar-Ber eased ahead and prompted a Springdale timeout with the Lady Bulldogs trailing 21-15. Senior Clara Fuentes entered the game late and she was serving when Lauren Thompson ended the game with a kill to give Har-Ber a 25-16 victory. \nLauren Thompson dominated the action in the second set to give Har-Ber a 2-0 series lead. Thompson had five kills down the stretch to put Har-Ber ahead 23-17. Her assault at the net was slowed only by Mack, who had a kill and a block to pull Springdale within 24-19. But that was as close the Lady Bulldogs would get. \nSpringdale played its best game in the third set and got to within 24-21 after a Har-Ber error. But Lauren Thompson again came up with a kill to end send her senior teammates out with a victory. \nSports on 10/21/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:16:15.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
