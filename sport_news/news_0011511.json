(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT \nTORONTO (AP) — A deflected throw back to the mound by Toronto catcher Russell Martin allowed Texas to score the tiebreaking run in the seventh inning, touching off a long delay and causing the Blue Jays to play Game 5 of the AL Division Series under protest. \nFans littered the field with debris during the 18-minute delay as umpires sorted out one of the most unusual plays in playoff history. \nWith Odor at third base and two outs, Martin’s throw back to the mound appeared to hit the hand of batter Shin-Soo Choo, allowing Odor to sprint home as the ball rolled up the third base line for a 3-2 lead. \nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister came out, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home.
