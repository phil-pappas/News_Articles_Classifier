Last year, it was all unknown for him. This year, he knew what to expect and he prepared accordingly. The way he works and practises \"¦ plus it's in him. He's a guy who wants to make a difference.\"\nLast year at this time, the diminutive fresh-faced kid from Boston College struggled mightily in his first five games, contributing just one shot on goal and raising doubts the Hobey Baker-winner was ready to make the jump from NCAA superstar to regular NHLer. Game 6 he earned a seat in the pressbox, and in Game 7, his final audition before likely being sent down to the AHL, he picked up his first NHL goal and assist.\nOne year later, he's gone from frustrated freshman to sophomore sniper, contributing to all four Flames goals so far. Two games in, he's already matched the four points it took him 10 games to accumulate last fall.\n\"I think it's hard to compare the two starts -- obviously, my first five or 10 games last year were a learning experience for me,\" said Gaudreau, whose surge to a 64-point season from that point on is well-documented.\n\"I have a whole year under my belt, so it's night and day from the season's start last year. I think it's the only time in my life I've ever struggled trying to find some points there. That's never really been a problem for me, so, hopefully, I can keep it going.\"\nAdding to Gaudreau's comfort is the fact he's still playing alongside Sean Monahan and Jiri Hudler, a trio that lead the NHL in points the final third of the season and was solid throughout the playoffs.\nNo longer is he going through all the pressure of cracking a new league or the trials of trying to figure out a new style of play. He's now simply able to read and react as naturally as he did in college.\n\"Last year, at the beginning of the season, in the back of my head I was always wondering, 'is this where I'm supposed to be?' Even if I was in the right spot, I was second-guessing myself because it was all new to me,\" said Gaudreau, who has a goal and three assists.\n\"This year, I know where to be and I know the systems -- it's just a lot easier,\" said the 22-year-old.\n\"Learning from Bob and the older guys in the locker-room has given me a lot of help.\"\nHe's also in better shape following a year of the Flames training regimen, which added several pounds of muscle to his 150-lb. frame.\n\"I had a good off-season and worked out pretty hard and came in a lot quicker and faster, so I am excited about this year,\" said Gaudreau, whose Flames host the jumbo-sized St. Louis Blues on Tuesday night.\n\"They're obviously a big, physical team but we can use our speed to our advantage.\"\nEspecially if it gets to 3-on-3 overtime again -- Johnny's favourite.\nFrancis is a Sportsnet West analyst on Flames home TV broadcasts.\neric.francis@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/EricFrancis\nEric Francis\n3-on-3 OT just icing on cake this season for Calgary Flames sniper Johnny Gaudreau\nBy Eric Francis , Calgary Sun First posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 07:55 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 12, 2015 08:12 PM EDT\nJohnny Gaudreau has an admission to make.\n\"In the summer when I was younger, we'd have 3-on-3 tournaments and that was my favourite time -- I wanted the season over so I could play 3-on-3 tournaments,\" said the Calgary Flames winger.\n\"Thankfully, it's in the NHL now.
