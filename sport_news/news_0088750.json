EAST RUTHERFORD – Tony Romo will not be in uniform for the Cowboys again until after Thanksgiving.\nDez Bryant is listed as doubtful for Sunday’s game against the Giants, but considering he has not even practiced since undergoing surgery to repair a broken foot five weeks ago, it’s very unlikely he plays, either.Just don’t tell the Giants, because as far as they are concerned, their approach is not going to change with or without Romo and Bryant on the field inside MetLife Stadium.\n\"If we start thinking we can relax because their franchise quarterback and their star receiver aren’t out there, that’s when you get into problems,\" cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie said. \"We’ve got to play it straight-up. Learn their schemes. Respect their players, whoever is out there, but the way we’re approaching this game, Romo and Dez might as well be playing. Best way to look at it.\"\nThe Cowboys will start veteran quarterback Matt Cassel, who has not thrown a pass in an NFL game since September 2014. Bryant is expected to be a game-time decision.\nWhat should also help the Giants defensively as they seek redemption for the season-opening debacle in Dallas is the anticipated return of linebacker Devon Kennard and defensive end Robert Ayers.\nAyers missed the previous four games with a hamstring injury.\nThat’s a potential boost for a front seven criticized this season for the absence of a pass rush with just seven sacks in six games.\n\"Going to go out there and let it rip,\" said Kennard, who has missed the last two games.\nAdded Giants coach Tom Coughlin: \"Obviously, Dallas has an outstanding offensive line. We would have some people that have demonstrated the ability to at least make the quarterback uncomfortable.\"\nThe Giants admitted after losing 27-26 to the Cowboys in heartbreaking fashion in Week 1 that the presence of Romo has turned into a bit of a fourth-quarter bugaboo for them in recent seasons. They have lost five straight games to Dallas, including last-second losses the past two seasons in which Romo has finished off game-winning drives with scoring strikes to Bryant and star tight end Jason Witten.\n\"I think that’s a point of emphasis just for our own pride,\" Kennard said. \"We didn’t get enough pressure on the quarterback the last time we played them, and we want to change that this time around. So that’s definitely something we want to improve and it starts with our front four. They’re going to get opportunities, and I think they’re up to the task.\n\"I’ve always been taught it takes four to get a sack — or at least four, we can be blessed with more than that. We’ve got to work together. On the back end, get some good coverage and allow those guys to go hunt.\"\nThe Cowboys are also planning to mix in former Seahawks running back Christine Michael in with Joseph Randle behind a new-look offensive line that will feature rookie La’El Collins at left guard.\n\"We can’t treat it like, ‘Oh, Romo’s not playing, so it’s going to be easy,’\" Giants defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins said. \"If we ease up on Cassel, he’ll beat us.\"\nBRIEFS: WR Odell Beckham Jr. (hamstring) is listed as questionable, but all signs point to him playing Sunday. When asked if Beckham will play, Coughlin said: \"I’m counting on that.\" … DE Damontre Moore was fined $20,000 for Monday’s late hit on Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:00:46.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
