I just looked at what we had coming back and what our plans were and figured the time was now.”\nCollins was enthused by the idea of reinserting Matt Harvey into the rotation and having a healthy David Wright.\nAnd even as the 2014 season wound down in disappointment, he and his staff had similar conversations.\n“We spent September and October talking about having [Jacob] deGrom for another year, [Noah] Syndergaard and [Steven] Matz on the rise, we should be pretty good,” Collins said.\nGeneral manager Sandy Alderson didn’t recall Collins’ precise proclamation, but had been aware that both the manager and the rest of the team would have the right attitude heading into this season.\n“I don’t remember the specifics, but I know Terry and the players talked confidently about 2015,” Alderson said. “They were talking about winning. It wasn’t me doing all the talking — and I was encouraged by that.”\nThough Alderson didn’t believe it was required to be said aloud, he took it as a good sign.\n“I don’t know if it was necessary, but the fact it was felt and articulated in a way to put themselves on the line was very positive,” the GM said. “One of the things about Terry is he’s honest. When he says something like that, he isn’t just saying it. And I’m glad it happened.”\nOf course, it wasn’t that simple.\nInjuries plagued the Mets once again and toward the end of July, they were 52-50 and trailed Washington by three games in the NL East.\n“Of course, I said all that and we can’t even get out of spring training without [Josh] Edgin going down, [Zack] Wheeler, [Jerry] Blevins got hurt and all of a sudden, the whole thing fell apart,” Collins said. “I’ve had two dinners with my coaches this postseason and gave them a lot of credit with keeping us afloat in June and July when we weren’t doing that great.”\nThat’s something that didn’t happen in one of his previous stops.\n“I lived through this in ’99 in Anaheim,” Collins said of his infamous flameout with the Angels. “We were gonna be in the mix and then Mo Vaughn gets hurt and [Jim] Edmonds is gone and it wasn’t good. I’d already lived this once. I didn’t want to live it again. So we kept a good attitude with winning with what we had and that’s what got us here.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  terry collins ,  world series", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:14:30.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
