Drenched in sweat, he removed his helmet to unwind for a moment before trotting to the locker room with the rest of Washington's offensive line. For the second straight week, the exhaustion had added significance.\n\"It feels like we're getting work done,\" LeRibeus said. \"It feels like I'm getting better today.\"\nIt's temporary, but LeRibeus has finally received his crack at the starting lineup after four seasons as a backup. He is expected to fill in at center for the second week in a row today against Tampa Bay as Kory Lichtensteiger continues to recover from neck and shoulder injuries.\nLeRibeus' second and third career starts were unexpected, but that would be the best way to sum up his career. Lichtensteiger made 53 consecutive starts at guard and center for the Redskinsbefore missing last week's 34-20 loss to the New York Jets.\n\"I've been waiting for a while (to start) and got it a little earlier than I thought I would,\" LeRibeus said. \"Kory will be fine, but I'm happy to step up.\"\nHe spent the extra time after practice continuing to develop chemistry with quarterback Kirk Cousins. LeRibeus worked on improving his snaps, an issue against the Jets, while also working on protection calls with his quarterback.\n\"He communicated pretty well,\" coach Jay Gruden said. \"Obviously, when you look at the grades of all the offensive linemen, nobody graded as an 'A,' but for his first time playing center, there were some positive things there. But I think he can build off his performance. The biggest issue were some of the snaps. We've just got to get some of the snaps under control a little bit and then finishing some blocks.\"\nLeRibeus didn't initially know the center position as a third-round pick out of Southern Methodist in 2012. Under then-coach Mike Shanahan, the rookie went through a failed experiment to learn both guard and center. But once offensive line coach Bill Callahan arrived during the offseason, he wanted LeRibeus to learn the center position again.\nSince the second week of offseason practices, LeRibeus had been the backup center, playing all four preseason games at the position and still serving as a backup at guard, where he has played 38 snaps this season.\nThe Redskins expected LeRibeus to contribute in a starting capacity long before last week's game. He had a shot to compete for a starting job during training camp in his second season but arrived 30 pounds overweight. LeRibeus was a staple on the inactive list for the season as a result. Last year, he played in seven games and got his first career start in Week 6 against the Jets. It was his final appearance as LeRibeus dealt with other health issues for the reminder of the year.\nLeRibeus regained value on the team with the arrival of Callahan, who prefers bigger offensive linemen. At 6-foot-3 and 315 pounds, LeRibeus had the frame for an offense that needed power blockers. He also gained versatility in the offseason with his second attempt at center, which has been a smoother transition than under Shanahan.\n\"I knew at some point, it's my fourth year, I kind of needed the opportunity and just trying to take advantage of it,\" LeRibeus said. \"The last few years, it gets tougher every week to watch the film, sit down and really just put your heart into it.\n\"I've been able to stay focused. I'm right there, front row, in the meeting room, and Bill is always up there. No slacking.\"\nTo make a debut at center against a stout Jets defensive line was a tough task, but it won't get any easier staring down the Bucs' Gerald McCoy. He leads all defensive tackles with 4-1/2 sacks, tied for the sixth most in the NFL, and had 2-1/2 during the last two contests against Carolina and Jacksonville.\nMcCoy brings a different challenge for the Redskins' interior linemen given his speed and quickness. For someone fairly new to the position, facing a three-time first-team all-Pro defensive tackle, LeRibeus said he hopes those extra 10 minutes of work will pay dividends today.\n\"It really brings in these little drills we do after practice,\" LeRibeus said. \"These little nuances, especially with a guy like (McCoy). You have to be on point every play.\"\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here. \n\nLoading...
