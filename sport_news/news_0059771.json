And according to KHOU , the argument started as a result of the boy telling his father that he planned on quitting the football team.\nThe boy, who is a junior at Clements High School in Sugar Land, reportedly got into an argument with his dad at the school after his dad discovered that he had skipped several practices. That argument continued at their family home later, and it ended with the boy allegedly stabbing his 45-year-old father in the stomach, back, and arms. The boy’s mother called 911, and his father had to be airlifted to a local hospital, where he is currently in stable condition.\n“There’s definitely quite a bit of tension, a lot of conflict between the boy and his father,” a police spokesman said told KHOU . “The son admitted that he had been skipping football practices and told his father he intended to quit the team.”\nThe boy is now facing an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge and could be charged with murder if his father does not recover from his injuries. He has reportedly refused to cooperate with police and hasn’t spoken about why he allegedly attacked his dad.\nWe imagine there has to be more to this story than is being reported now. Stay tuned for additional details.\n .\n[ via The Big Lead ]", "external_links": ["http://thebiglead.com/2015/10/14/texas-high-school-football-player-stabs-father-after-fight-over-desire-to-quit-team/", "http://www.khou.com/story/news/crime/2015/10/12/teen-custody-after-allegedly-stabbing-father/73845080/"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:21:56.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
