The Jets weren't able to get out of London without getting banged up.\nA trio of injuries struck the defense as the team tried to hold onto its lead over the Dolphins Sunday.\nFirst safety Calvin Pryor, who is playing better in his second season, was hurt in the fourth quarter after his knee collided with Jordan Cameron. Pryor was on the ground, clutching his right knee, before he was able to slowly walk off the field.\n HERE.\nJust a couple of minutes later, LB David Harris was hurt as well with what appeared to be a right leg injury. Harris, too, was able to walk off, albeit with a slight limp.\nDarrelle Revis picked off Ryan Tannehill to stop the Dolphins' drive that Harris and Pryor were hurt on.\nLater in the fourth quarter, first-round pick Leonard Williams also suffered what appeared to a leg injury. Williams was able to walk off, but with a substantial limp.\nWith the slew of injuries hitting the Jets late, they may be fortunate to have their bye coming up next week.\nPryor is officially probable to return with a knee injury.\nHarris is doubtful to return with a quad injury.\n@SethWalderNYDN\nRelated Stories VIDEO: Ndamukong Suh kicks Ryan Fitzpatrick in head Jets vs. Dolphins: LIVE BOXSCORE Tags: calvin pryor , david harris", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T20:12:26.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
