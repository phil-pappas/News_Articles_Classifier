It did not come through a dominant offensive or defenisve performance but rather a tremendous single play that gave the Yellow Jackets hopes of bowl eligibility while dashing the Noles' championship dreams in an instant.\nIf Florida State, which won the national title in 2013 and made the first CFP semifinals last season, harbors any hope of getting back into the big game, it will need lots of help. It can help its cause some on Nov. 7 when it goes head-to-head with ACC favorite Clemson, which destroyed Miami 58-0 on Saturday.\n\"We can't let one loss become two,\" Fisher said.\n\nA stunned Jimbo Fisher leaves the field after Georgia Tech's shocker Saturday.
