(Courtesy Photo) \nLOWELL, Mass. — Former UMass Lowell River Hawks hockey player Tyler Mayea was found not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman off-campus this spring during a party. \nIt was determined after a three-day trial that Mayea was of indecent assault and battery on someone 14 or older and assault and battery in connection with the April 26 incident on Merrimack Street in Lowell, according to the Lowell Sun . \nMayea’s defense attorney MaryEllen Cuthbert told the jury that although the incident was horrible, this is a case of a mistaken identity. The victim knew her assailant was a UMass Lowell hockey player, but couldn’t describe the player. She later picked out Mayea from the roster. However, what Cuthbert would argue is another statement made from the victim when the victim testified she remembered seeing his image on the Jumbotron during home games. The only problem with that statement is that Mayea play or dress for any contests at the Tsongas Center and wouldn’t have been shown on the screen. \nThe 22-year-old joined the River Hawks late after committing to the program in September of 2014 . The Burlington, Ontario native skated in only two road games with no points and a minus-one. He was cut from the team following the season. \nThe defenseman played his final season of junior hockey for the Trenton Golden Hawks of the Ontario Junior Hockey League (OJHL) where he tallied 49 points (11g, 38a) over 52 games.
