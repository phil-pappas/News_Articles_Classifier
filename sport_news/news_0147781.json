Another three games between ranked teams and undefeated ones will give an idea if those unranked and unblemished teams have also been underrated.\nSome things to watch for a huge Week 5 schedule:\nWeather\nThe combination of Hurricane Joaquin and a rain storm already soaking the East Coast could make for some soggy showdowns. Most likely to be affected are two games sharing top billing this weekend, one in Athens, Ga., and the other in Clemson, S.C.\nNo. 13 Alabama (3-1) visits Sanford Stadium for the first time since 2008 to face No. 8 Georgia (4-0). Both teams can rely on their running games if wind and rain make it tough for the quarterbacks. Bulldogs running back Nick Chubb has 12 straight 100-yard rushing games, one shy of Herschel Walker's school record. The sophomore is sixth in the nation, 149.8 yards per game. The Crimson Tide can give it to Derrick Henry , who is averaging 105 yards per game and has scored eight touchdowns.\nMore Information\nPreview capsules\nNo. 6 Notre Dame (4-0) at No. 12 Clemson (3-0), 8 p.m. (ABC-10)\nLine: Pick 'em.\nSeries: Tied 1-1.\nWhat's at stake: Both teams are thinking College Football Playoff and the loser's chances take a big hit. A big matchup will be Notre Dame WR Will Fuller against Clemson CB MacKensie Alexander. Fuller is eighth in the country with 454 yards on 22 catches, six going for TDs. He will be matched largely against Alexander, who specializes at shutting off his side of the field.\nNo. 13 Alabama (3-1, 0-1 SEC) at No. 8 Georgia (4-0, 2-0), 3:30 p.m. (CBS-6)\nLine: Georgia by 2.\nSeries: Alabama leads 37-25-4.\nWhat's at stake: Georgia could set itself up for an undefeated run to the Southeastern Conference championship game by beating the Crimson Tide. The only other currently ranked opponent left on the Bulldogs' schedule is No. 25 Florida. Alabama, which has won four of the last six SEC titles, can't afford another conference setback after losing at home to Mississippi two weeks ago.\nNo. 3 Mississippi (4-0, 2-0 SEC) at No. 25 Florida (4-0, 2-0), 7 p.m. (ESPN)\nLine: Mississippi by 7 &frac12;\nSeries: Mississippi leads 12-10-1\nWhat's at stake: An undefeated record and a chance to stay atop each team's respective division in the Southeastern Conference. The Rebels also get a chance to prove that 43-37 victory at Alabama two weeks ago was no fluke. The Gators, meanwhile, can take a huge step toward coach Jim McElwain's catchphrase of \"restore the order.\"\nNo. 6 Notre Dame (4-0) is making its first trip to Clemson since 1977 for the third game ever between the Fighting Irish and 12th-ranked Tigers. Weather forecasts were calling for rainfall that could approach 20 inches in the area for a game that has been such a hot ticket that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said he couldn't get Jesus a ticket.\nFor real?\nIndiana, Iowa and Kansas State have yet to impress poll voters with their perfect starts. One more win this weekend should change that.\nThe Hoosiers, 4-0 for the first time since 1990, have the toughest task with No. 1 Ohio State (4-0) coming to Bloomington. Indiana's offense features an NFL prospect at quarterback in Nate Sudfeld and the second-leading rusher in the country in Jordan Howard, but the defense ranks near the bottom of the Big Ten. To make things even more difficult for the Hoosiers, they will have to stop Ezekiel Elliott and Cardale Jones without suspended defensive lineman Darius Latham .\nIowa is 4-0 for the first time since 2009, which was also the last year the Hawkeyes beat No. 19 Wisconsin (3-1) in the battle of the Heartland Trophy. Iowa goes to Madison, Wisc., trying to break a three-game losing streak to the Badgers.\nKansas State (3-0) is off to its best start since 2012 as it heads to Stillwater, Oklahoma, to face No. 20 Oklahoma State (4-0).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:21:44.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
