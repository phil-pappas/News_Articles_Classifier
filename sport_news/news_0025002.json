(AP) - New York Jets wide receiver Quincy Enunwa was suspended four games without pay by the NFL on Monday for violating the league’s personal conduct policy. \nThe suspension stems from an incident last year in which Enunwa was arrested for simple assault on his girlfriend at a New Jersey hotel. Domestic violence charges were later dropped in the case. \nIn a statement, the Jets said they “support and respect the NFL’s decision” to suspend Enunwa. \n“The New York Jets share the NFL’s ongoing commitment to raising awareness of the frequency and impact of domestic and relationship violence,” the statement added, “supporting survivors and encouraging others to speak out and seek help.” \nEnunwa has become a key part of the offense as a blocking receiver after being a sixth-round pick out of Nebraska last year. He has eight catches for 94 yards this season after earning the role as the Jets’ No. 3 receiver behind starters Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker. \nEnunwa is eligible to return to the Jets’ active roster on Nov. 13, following the team’s game against the Buffalo Bills on Nov. 12. He’ll miss New York’s AFC East showdown with New England on Sunday, as well as games at Oakland and against Jacksonville at home. As per the league’s personal conduct policy, Enunwa is not allowed at the team’s facility during his suspension. \nCoach Todd Bowles said he learned of Enunwa’s suspension Monday, but was aware since the preseason that the NFL could make a decision at some point during the season. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:39:29.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
