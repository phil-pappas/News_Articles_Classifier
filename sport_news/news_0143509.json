Seriously. 10! The way Sean Payton cycles through place kickers makes the fact he has hired four different defensive coordinators in 9 years as coach seem almost reasonable. \nIn case you were wondering about the collection of Saints kickers since Payton arrived, it includes John Carney, Billy Cundiff, Olindo Mare, Martín Gramática, Tyler Mehlhaff, Garrett Hartley, John Kasay, Shane Graham, Zach Hocker and the newly signed Kia Forbath. That's quite the list. Who's excited to read about the good, the bad, and the ugly of kickers under Sean Payton? \nJohn Carney is probably the most consistent of the bunch. He kicked parts of eight years for the Saints, made 82 percent of his kicks, and was elected into the Saints Hall of Fame. I won't mention the missed PAT in Jacksonville because that happened before Sean Payton. Also, it's just too much pain. Let's just move along... \nBilly Cundiff played in 5 games for the Saints in 2006. Pro Football Reference said he made a field goal for the Saints, but the only thing I ever remember of him is he missed a kick in Chicago in the NFC Championship game. He actually went on to be really good for Baltimore until he missed a huge kick in an AFC Championship game. He was first team All-Pro in 2010 and out of the league by 2014. \nThe Saints tried to fix their kicking issue by trading for Olindo Mare in 2007. He promptly had the worst season of his entire 16-year career. As a Saint he hit 58 percent of his kicks, but for his career he made 81 percent. He was awful to start his Saints career, seemed to get things fixed, then got injured. The Saints moved on after 2007 and Mare went back to being good again. He kicked five more years in the NFL and never made less than 75 percent of his kicks. Maybe he didn't like Cajun food or something? There really is no other explanation for his awfulness as a Saint. \nIn 2008 Sean Payton got really crazy and had three different kickers. The Saints had Martín Gramática and his big head and bigger celebrations. Nobody ever celebrated the 32-yard field goal like Martín. The Saints also drafted Taylor Mehlhaff, but the only thing I remember about him is he missed an extra point when the Saints played in London. Did the Saints even bring him home from Europe? Or is he still backpacking in Switzerland? \nThen came everyone's favorite bow hunter, Garrett Hartley, who actually was as stable a kicker as Payton has had. Hartley made 13 straight kicks to finish 2008 and it looked like the Saints at long last had a kicker. Unfortunately, Hartley got suspended for four games to open 2009, the Saints brought back John Carney, and Hartley didn't retake the job until late in the year. He missed a game winner against Tampa but was spectacular in the playoffs and Super Bowl. In the Super Bowl he kicked three field goals over 40 yards long, and if Tracy Porter doesn't intercept that Peyton Manning pass, Hartley was in my opinion a game winning kick away from being the game's MVP. He was that good. \nIn 2010 Hartley made 80 percent of his kicks, but he missed a couple big ones, so the Saints brought back John Carney and sat Hartley for two weeks. In 2011 he missed the entire season because of injury, so the Saints brought in kicker number seven under Payton, John Kasay. Kasay made 82 percent of his kicks, including two from beyond 50 yards. Not bad for a 42-year-old. \nHartley made 81 percent of his kicks in 2012, but he had a huge miss against Green Bay. He made the first kick, but the Saints had a holding penalty. He missed the second attempt from 10 yards further out. In 2013 Hartley only made 73 percent of his kicks, had an atrocious game during a blowout loss in St. Louis, and Sean Payton cut him. Payton and Saints fans are extremely fortunate Hartley was exceptional in the two biggest moments of his football life, or else the Saints kicking problems would have cost them their best shot at a Super Bowl. \nShane Graham walked in after Hartley, kicked the game winner along with three other field goals in a playoff game in Philadelphia, and probably because of it got to kick for the Saints in 2014. He made 86 percent of his kicks in 2014 so it was a wise call by the Saints. \nIn 2015 the Saints decided to have a kicking competition between Zack Hocker and Dustin Hopkins. Hopkins was clearly better in practice by most reports, but Hocker was slightly better in the games. The Saints chose Hocker and the Washington Redskins signed Hopkins after Week 1. Hocker was mostly terrible for the Saints; He made 9 of 13 kicks, missed a chip shot game winner against the Dallas Cowboys, and an extra point against Tampa. \nSo what did the Saints do? They signed the kicker Washington tossed out after the Redskins signed the kicker the Saints released before the season started. Each team found a new kicker in the other team's recycle bin. It's the most Saints move ever. \nSay hello to Kai Forbath, the kicker Washington got rid of for a Saints cast-off! Forbath has made 87 percent of his kicks in four years, kicked the game winner in three of four Redskins wins in 2014, but is terrible at kicking off, so Washington showed him the door. The good news is, if Thomas Morstead is healthy, kicking off won't be an issue for the Saints. \nIs Kai the long-term solution at kicker? Who knows. A word of advice Kai, rent, don't buy, and don't shank an easy game winner or the Saints will be on to kicker No. 11 come Monday. \nThe Games Last Week: 2-3 Season:14-16 \nNew Orleans (+4) at Indianapolis: This feels like a really nice spot for the Saints provided the offensive line can get a healthy Terron Armstead back. If the Saints try to perform the magic trick of Tony Hills at left tackle again, it will be hazardous to Drew Brees' health. \nThe Colts played like a desperate, motivated team Sunday night against New England. They tried an onsides kick and the hilariously inept fake punt that was like a Jackson Pollock work of art. It was weird, funny, no one knew exactly what it was, but we know we'll remember it forever. \nThe Saints still aren't any good, but neither are the Colts. The Saints are 32nd in total defense but Indy is 29th, including 28th against the pass. I wonder if Rob Ryan might have the courage to let Delvin Breaux guard T.Y. Hilton one-on-one and get really weird with the rest of his defense? A month ago that thought would have seemed crazy, but Breaux is rapidly figuring out how to be an elite corner. \nThe Saints on the road have mostly been the cure for whatever problems other teams have, but I just have this hunch Indianapolis is going to play flat after such a giant effort against New England. The new Saints kicker has to figure prominently in this game one way or another. Feels like time for a little Drew Brees road magic followed by Kai Forbath lining up a 43yard kick for a win or heartbreaking loss. \nLet's go with the happy ending. \nSaints 30-28 \nCarolina (-3.5) vs. Philadelphia: The Panthers are making magic with duct tape, chewing gum and Cam Newton being awesome. I'm really not sure why they are undefeated. \nPanthers 23-16 \nTampa Bay (+3.5) at Washington: Poor Robert Griffin III. Washington won't play him because the coach hates him and they don't want him to get hurt and have to pay him $16 million next year, but they also won't release the guy and let him try to salvage his career somewhere else. Be glad we aren't Redskins fans, because they seem to not be good at football decisions, which might be a good sign for the Saints new kicker. \nBucs 20-14 \nDetroit (+2.5) vs. Minnesota: The Vikings currently are the final playoff team in the NFC. They are 3-2 and smell of mediocrity. There might be an 8-8 wild card in the NFC, and if the Saints could aspire to be average, it could be them! \n/sigh \nLions 28-24 \nBaltimore (+7.5) at Arizona: When did Baltimore become a burning pile of trash? That happened really quickly. I feel like they were really good last year and now can barely put their uniforms on right. \nCardinals 31-20 \nRalph Malbrough is a Saints fan living in Houston.
