But a lot of questions need to be answered before more are added. \n\"We are up against a wall, our jail is full and I need secure beds,\" Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead said. \"We're at the key decision point of where are we going to build and what size are we going make this facility and how are we going to finance it. It is a very real need to keep our community safe and to keep my staff safe and to keep the people in our custody safe.\" \nMilstead says a decision needs to be made because the crime rate is rising. \n\"If you look at the number of case fillings on felony charges on the last 5 years, they have gone up substantially. These are people who are committing armed robberies, burglaries, aggravated assault, domestic cases, and these are people who need to be behind bars,\" Milstead said. \nBut if an expansion is approved it could take years to complete, and it will cost the county a lot of money. \n\"This project could be over $40 million. But it is a very real need in our growing community. And when I talk to citizens, they tell me they want to make sure if someone is arrested on a serious charge that we have a secure and safe jail cell to house that person in,\" Milstead said. \nMore 20 years ago, the county commission purchased the Elks Club on West Russell Street to build the Community Correction Center, which is typically used for low risk inmates. \n\"We really don't utilize low risk beds anymore because we have so many people out on alternatives to incarceration,\" Milstead said. \nSelling this property could be a solution to help offset expansion expenses. \n\"The property value is substantial compared to what it used to be,\" Milstead said. \"This would be a good time to replace the facility and sell that property to help us with some of the expenses related to the expansion to this current jail. I don't need the low-risk beds anymore, I need regular jail cells.\" \nMilstead says the county is getting down to the wire and decisions need to be made soon so they can start moving forward with this process.
