(AP) - A Gulfport man has been indicted for capital murder in the slaying of a 5-year-old girl who was abducted outside her family's apartment last year.\nMultiple media outlets report Harrison County District Attorney Joel Smith announced the indictment of Alberto Garcia on Monday. A trial date will be set later.\nJa-Naya Thompson was found dead in July 17, 2014, a day after she disappeared. A search dog tracked her scent to a mobile home Garcia is accused of burglarizing days earlier.\nAn autopsy showed Ja-Naya died of asphyxiation by strangulation, and investigators said she had been sexually assaulted.\nSmith says it took more than 14 months to present the case to the grand jury because investigators were waiting for state crime lab technicians to finish analyzing forensic evidence.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
