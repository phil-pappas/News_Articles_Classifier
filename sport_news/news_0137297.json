The man they call Smoke might be getting back to his true personality just in time to give himself and his fans one more fun year.\nIf there’s anything to take from his answers and attitude Wednesday, when Stewart said Clint Bowyer will replace him in the No. 14 car beginning in 2017, it’s that Stewart suddenly looks happier than he’s been in the last few seasons.\nUSA TODAY\nAppeals panel upholds penalties against Clint Bowyer and MWR\nHe jokingly appointed himself as the second driver for co-owner Gene Haas’ new Formula One team , announced he was naming 75-year-old Harry Gant to take his seat and theorized he might go “sightseeing” in the rowdy infields of some tracks after he quits driving.\nThe decision, he made it clear, was his decision on his terms. It had “zero percent” to do with the badly broken leg he suffered in 2013 or the tragedy that killed Kevin Ward Jr. last year . It also didn’t have anything to do with his lackluster results lately, he said.\n“It's the right thing,” he said. “It's not performance‑based, it's just time to do what we're doing. I still fully anticipate we're going to get things turned around. If I didn't feel that way, I wouldn't waste my time next year for anybody.”\nAnd next year, Stewart hinted, could be a vintage one for perhaps the greatest driver of his generation. He vowed to be a thorn in NASCAR’s side like he used to be, in preparation for getting called to the hauler once he’s just a team owner instead of an owner/driver.\nUSA TODAY\nNASCAR will lose star power when Tony Stewart walks away\nHe issued a not-so-subtle warning to his competitors, too, emphasizing he’ll race like he has nothing to lose.\n“Next year is not a coast-and-collect year,” he said. “It's just the opposite because I don't have to worry about making anybody mad next year and having to deal with it in 2017. I can rough everybody up next year if that's what it takes to accomplish my goals and sit there and just smile and laugh about it at Homestead.”\nEven after he finally stops driving in the Cup Series, he said, “I'm still going to be at the track harassing everybody, so nobody is getting a free pass now.”\nThe return of the prankster, sarcastic Stewart would be a welcome sight, although it also might be a case of “Be careful what you wish for.” But that's because Stewart has seemed increasingly miserable since the pinnacle of his career in 2011, when he won his third championship on a tiebreaker in one of NASCAR’s all-time performances.\nHis results were already slipping before a sprint car crash shattered his leg in 2013, and it wasn’t getting any better in 2014 before the Ward accident. In public appearances, the spark has gone out of his eye.\nIt's been painful to watch his swagger disappear, his confidence dwindle, his results tank. Stewart just wasn't the same driver he used to be.\nThat could be changing soon, though. Last year, sitting on the same stage in the Haas F1 Team’s auditorium, Stewart said the thought of retiring would “take the life out of me.”\nBut Wednesday, he emphasized he isn’t retiring from driving — just from the Sprint Cup Series. There are other races to be run, and on his schedule instead of NASCAR’s.\nUSA TODAY\nTony Stewart's legendary career saw struggles, success come hand in hand\nStewart spoke of racing a truck at the Eldora Speedway dirt track he owns in Ohio, getting into a modified car at New Hampshire Motor Speedway and even “maybe, probably” returning to sprint car races.\nPlus, he’ll still be around NASCAR as a co-owner at Stewart-Haas Racing.\n“I'm not leaving the sport I love,” he said. “I'm not walking away from something I'm passionate about — I'm just changing roles, which is like just moving to a different position in a company.”\nIn the meantime, he has one more chance at the big races which have eluded him — the Daytona 500 and Darlington's Southern 500 — and perhaps the opportunity to get a fourth championship next season. He warned reporters to write down his 2016 goals now instead of asking him about it next year, because, in typical Stewart fashion, he likely won’t have the patience for those questions after Wednesday.\nFOR THE WIN\nNASCAR drivers, fans react to Tony Stewart's retirement announcment\nThe 44-year-old vowed to avoid the weekly media center trips like the ones Jeff Gordon has been taking this year to discuss his career and receive retirement gifts from track presidents. A retirement tour like that one, Stewart said, wasn't his style.\n“You can save your gifts,” he said. “… I'm not really that kind of guy. I'm content to go race and be around the racing community and the racing family and be around our fans. They can just send me a note from the track president and say, ‘Hey, thank you,’ and that'll be sufficient for me.”\nBut the main reason Stewart even decided to race one more year was to acknowledge the fans. Otherwise, he might have preferred to clap his hands like a blackjack dealer at the end of his shift, then “turn around and walk out of the building,” he said.\n“The reason that we decided to go ahead and run through the end of next year is 100% because of the fans that have supported us through the years,” he said. “It's as important for me to do this for them as it is for me to do what I'm doing for my future.”\nAnd that future suddenly looks a lot happier for a man who hadn't seemed very happy until Wednesday.\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck\nPHOTOS: Behind the wheel with Tony Stewart\nTony Stewart, born May 20, 1971, in Columbus, Ind., is a three time NASCAR Cup Series champion (2002, '05, 11), the 1997 Indy Racing League (IndyCar) champion and the 1995 USAC Triple Crown champion.
