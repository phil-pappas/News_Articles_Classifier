Had Graham hooked decisively and worked back to Wilson, there was an opportunity for a completion. Instead, Graham hooked at the 11-yard line and actually backpedaled away from the quarterback, giving 4 full yards of ground. This allowed the linebacker to deflect the ball for the interception. \nCritical errors by Wilson and Graham were amplified because of several factors: 1) The interception came immediately after a huge play by Seattle; 2) It was first down; 3) Jermaine Kearse and Tyler Lockett were both wide open on a hitch route and a “snag” concept (a short pass with a slant-stop coupled with a swing route), respectively. \n• Adding insult to injury: The Bengals had just 10 players on the field. Unfortunately for the Seahawks, this would not be Graham’s lone crucial mistake for the day. On two separate third-and-shorts later in the fourth quarter, Seattle’s tight end was the primary receiver on “stick” routes (short out routes), and on both occasions Graham took too many choppy steps and leaned back instead of forward at the break point. By telegraphing his route, he achieved no separation. \n• Two TDs on seam routes to Tyler Eifert: The plays were identical from the Cincinnati perspective. Eifert ran a straight, vertical seam route from his alignment as the left tight end. The flanker to Eifert’s left would create confusion by running the same “spot” route (slant-stop) that Lockett ran on the Graham interception. Confusion results when a wide receiver sits short, inside and underneath, paired with a running back on a swing route to the same side, while an inside receiver, (Eifert), runs deep. \nThe Bengals also effectively used their best receiver, A.J. Green, as a decoy. By aligning Green in the slot opposite Eifert, Seattle on both touchdowns was compelled to align free safety Earl Thomas to Green’s side to defend a Green seam route, though on both plays the ball was snapped from the left hash mark. Ultimately Seattle aligned four defenders to Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton’s right to defend two receivers while the Seahawks aligned just three defenders to Dalton’s left to defend three receivers. When a tight end runs a seam route, one or two things must happen to cover him: either a shallow defender must “carry” the seam (meaning run deep with the seam route) or a deep defender must be over the top. Assuming Thomas was correctly shaded to Green on Eifert’s first touchdown, strong safety Kam Chancellor needed to carry the seam. But on Eifert’s second touchdown, cornerback Cary Williams dropped to his deep zone (he had stayed shallow covering the flanker on the first touchdown). With Williams deep, the only way Seattle could soundly cover the flanker’s spot route would be for Chancellor to remain in his shallow area and not carry Eifert’s seam. Williams had to cover Eifert — defending a large, athletic tight end breaking to the inside from a disadvantageous outside position. \nBottom line: Green disrupted Seattle’s normal zone spacing enough to allow two easy touchdowns to Eifert.
