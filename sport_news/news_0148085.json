The move came after the Dolphins fired head coach Joe Philbin on Monday and promoted tight ends coach Campbell. Coyle was widely criticized for the decline of the defense since he joined the Dolphins in 2012. They gave up 317 points that season, followed by 335 and 373, and after four games they're on pace to allow 404 this season. Miami (1-3) ranks last in the NFL in rushing defense at 160.5 yards per game, and last with one sack despite the offseason addition of $114 million tackle Ndamukong Suh. During his introductory news conference, Campbell said the defense needed to become more aggressive.
