Palatine Hall of Fame The big win by Palatine's football team over state-ranked Barrington on Friday night was part of a festive night at the District 211 school. Prior to the homecoming victory, the induction of the 2015 class for Palatine's Athletic Hall of Fame took place. Here is a look at the newest four members: Dr. Nancy Robb: Robb is Pirate Pride personified. As principal of Palatine High School from 1990-2002, she led with charisma, energy and passion. She expected the same from her staff and students. During her time, Palatine won 29 IHSA state trophies, nine of which were state championship teams. Palatine was also awarded two Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Awards from the U.S. Department of Education in 1993 and 2000, as well as named a \"New American High School\" and received the Character Education Award. Under Robb's leadership, Palatine was among the nation's \"Top 99\" high schools named by U.S. News and World Report in 1999. She was individually honored by the Illinois State Board of Education with a 'Those Who Excel Award' in 1993. She also received a Distinguished Alumni Citation from her alma mater, Wittenberg University, in 1997. Dr. Robb served as a District 211 assistant superintendent from 2002-2008, engineering many successful programs and initiatives. She was eventually named District 211's sixth superintendent in 2008 and held that position until 2014. Dr. Robb was the face of District 211 for many years, but Palatine High School will always be her home. Josh Heffernan: Heffernan's impressive wrestling resume is what he is most known for, but it is not what defines him. His success in wrestling, football and baseball is what landed him a place in Palatine High School's Athletic Hall of Fame. Heffernan was a two-time state qualifier in wrestling and holds the school season record with 30 pins. He followed up his second-place state finish his senior year by becoming a USAW junior national qualifier. After successful football and baseball seasons, he was awarded male athlete of the year in 1994. Heffernan continued his athletic career at Ohio University as a rare two-sport Division I varsity athlete. He was a member of Ohio's baseball team and a key component on their wrestling team. He was also three-time Mid-American Conference place winner and culminated his wrestling career by becoming an NCAA qualifier in 1999. Even though his competitive wrestling career has come to an end, Heffernan has made a career out of the sport. After serving as an assistant wrestling and football coach at Palatine, Heffernan moved back to Ohio to become a teacher and head coach at Delaware Hayes High School. Bob Carroll: Carroll wore many hats in his 30-plus years of service to Palatine High School and its athletic department. He began his teaching and coaching tenure in 1979, coaching girls tennis at the varsity and junior varsity levels over the next 14 years. After leaving the tennis program in a better place than when he started, Carroll switched seasons and coached multiple levels of girls softball for the next 10 years, including stints as a head coach and an assistant coach. Proving he was a man of many talents and the prototypical team player, Carroll was also an assistant basketball coach for one season, filling a void on the staff at the last minute. His most noteworthy accomplishment, however, was winning the Physically Handicapped State Championship floor hockey tournament 22 times. He was able to get the most out of each and every one of his student-athletes by being both demanding and compassionate. He knew when to crank up the intensity and when to lighten the mood with his sense of humor, which many feel is his greatest gift. The way he interacts with players and coaches alike, it is no wonder that Carroll is an all time favorite at Palatine High School. Katlin Millin: Millin was a three-sport athlete and garnered individual accolades while leading her teams to record-breaking seasons. In cross country her senior year, Millin helped lead her team to an MSL Championship as well as a third-place trophy at the state meet. On the basketball court, she was a two-year starter and often guarded the other team's best player. She led her team in rebounds her senior year, a statistic that exemplified her hustle and determination. Her 2005 team won the MSL West, and she followed that up by leading her team to a school-record 21 wins as well as a regional championship in 2006. Millin's contributions did not go unnoticed, as she was named both all-conference and all-area. In track, Millin really made a name for herself running both individual events and relays. She was a five-time MSL individual champion and led her teams to many more awards. Millin won multiple state medals but her most noteworthy accomplishment was running the opening leg of the state champion 3200-meter relay in 2005. Millin went on to run track at Marquette University, where she was a member of many successful teams. She was a two-time All Big East runner and took legs on the three fastest 3,200-meter relay teams in Marquette history. • Submit Sports Notes items to jleusch@dailyherald.com Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:53:51.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
