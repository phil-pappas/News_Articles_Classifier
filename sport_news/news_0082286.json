If missing the 2015-16 opener gave him a better chance of playing more games throughout the season, though, the Bruins' captain was willing to grit his teeth and stay out of uniform. \"You always want to play,\" said Chara, 38, who remained on injured reserve with an upper body injury as the Bruins opened against the Jets at TD Garden. \"Unfortunately … the stage where I'm at, I've got to wait for another day.\" Chara, injured in his only preseason appearance, on Sept. 24, began skating by himself within days, and returned to practice on Tuesday. He reported progress all the way through Thursday's morning skate, but the risk of aggravating the injury was deemed too great so early in the season. \"I'm OK to be smart about it,\" he said. \"Obviously, I want to play as soon as possible, but at the same time, it's Game One. Not that it's less important than any other game, but at this time I just want to continue to have progress, and keep going forward with it, instead of having any setbacks.\" Chara, who did extra conditioning drills after Thursday's morning skate, answered, \"No guess; looking forward to tomorrow,\" when asked if he thought he'd play against the visiting Canadiens on Saturday night. He's willing to play in pain (he played the last three games of last season with a fractured fibula), but the Bruins will make sure he doesn't risk reinjury. \"If there's no risk and he's got to play hurt, or little risk and he's got to play with a little bit of pain — no problem,\" coach Claude Julien said. \"If it's the other way around — there's a big risk — why risk it this early in the season?\" Hutchinson enjoys return to Boston Michael Hutchinson didn't get a chance to improve on his 2-0-1 career record over the team that drafted him, but the former Bruins goaltending prospect enjoyed another return to Boston. \"It was a long road to get to the NHL, and Boston was the place where it all started,\" said Hutchinson, 25, a third-round draft choice (No. 77 overall) in 2008. \"I'm thankful for the opportunity they gave me.\" Hutchinson rarely made it to Boston during three seasons in the organization. Besides a couple of one-game recalls as a backup, he spent most of his time at AHL Providence. With goalie Malcolm Subban drafted in the first round in 2012, the Bruins allowed Hutchinson to become an unrestricted free agent when his entry-level contract expired following the 2012-13 season. \"Giving me a chance to try with another organization, and then having it work out the way it did, is something I'm always grateful for,\" said Hutchinson, who got a first, three-game taste of the NHL — including a 2-1, shootout decision over the Bruins for his first win — late in 2013-14, and graduated full-time to the NHL last season. \"At the same time, it's really nice … playing well against them.\" Miller, Talbot and Randell out In addition to Chara, defenseman Colin Miller and wingers Max Talbot and Tyler Randell were scratched. The Bruins started the season with the maximum 23 active players (14 forwards, 7 defensemen, 2 goalies), but one player will have to come off the roster when Chara is ready to play. Talbot cleared waivers on Tuesday … Six players — forwards Jimmy Hayes, Zac Rinaldo, Matt Beleskey and Joonas Kemppainen, defenseman Matt Irwin and No. 2 goalie Jonas Gustavsson — dressed as Bruins for the first time. It was Kemppainen's first NHL game. By Mike Loftus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:56:15.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
