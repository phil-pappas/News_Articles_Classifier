(Al Bello / Getty Images) Lance Pugmire Contact Reporter \nCuban heavyweight Luis Ortiz quickly disposed of his opponent Saturday, and the equivalent of that rapid development was matched Wednesday by his promoter. \nOrtiz (23-0, 20 knockouts) already has an opponent set for his next bout and it’s a skilled foe: recent heavyweight title contender Bryant Jennings. \nOrtiz and Jennings (19-1, 10 KOs) will fight Dec. 19 at Turning Stone Resort in New York. The bout will be televised on HBO’s “Boxing After Dark.” \n“What a terrific heavyweight showdown,” Ortiz promoter Oscar De La Hoya of Golden Boy Promotions said after making the bout. “We’re obviously banking on Ortiz to win, and if he wins, we want to go after [three-belt heavyweight world champion Wladmir] Klitschko.” \nOrtiz and Jennings will fight for the World Boxing Assn. interim belt that Ortiz claimed Saturday by knocking out Matias Ariel Vidondo in the third round at Madison Square Garden. \nThe bout was on the undercard of middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin’s unification victory over David Lemieux by technical knockout.

He’s demolishing everyone he’s faced,” De La Hoya said. “So if he demolishes Jennings, it’s his time. \n“He’s determined, motivated, he wants to be great and wants to take on all comers. People love that matchup and he loves it. This fight here with Jennings is a perfect heavyweight fight and a perfect test. If he knocks out Jennings, which Klitschko couldn’t do, we have a real contender.” \nPhiladelphia’s Jennings, 31, hasn’t fought since losing to Klitschko by unanimous decision on April 25 at Madison Square Garden. Two judges scored the bout eight rounds to four (116-112) and the other had it 118-110. \n“Jennings doesn’t crack under pressure, he has a great chin and is very athletic,” De La Hoya said. \nMaking the bout halted rumors that De La Hoya’s former fighter, World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder, would fight Jennings next. It also allowed De La Hoya to take a dig at Wilder. \n“Ortiz will give problems to any heavyweight. We know Deontay Wilder will never fight Ortiz. If he gets hit by Ortiz, he’s not getting up,” De La Hoya said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:20:58.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
