Wrzuszczak garnered OVC Specialist of the Week honors. \nSpence anchored a defense that limited Southeast Missouri to only 52 yards of offense in the second half. SEMO finished with just 191 total yards, including a mere 31 on the ground. The redshirt junior from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania finished with seven tackles (3.5 for a loss) and 1.5 sacks. He has at least one sack in every game this season. \nSpence ranks first nationally in tackles-for-loss per game (2.0), fourth in sacks per game (1.17) and 18th in forced fumbles per game (0.33). \nWrzuszczak averaged 45.5 yards on his four punts against Southeast. However, it was his arm that helped put the game away for the Colonels. With EKU up only 17-10 late in the third quarter and facing a 4th-and-9, the sophomore rolled out to punt, but instead threw to Barton Mann for 16 yards and a first down. Eastern would cap the drive with a touchdown that put the game away. One of his four punts went for 52 yards. \nOn the season Wrzuszczak ranks 10th nationally in punting (43.5 ypp). \nThe Colonels will host Tennessee State for Homecoming on Saturday. Kickoff at Roy Kidd Stadium is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:08:04.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
