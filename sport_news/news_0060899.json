Not only were they the defending district champions, but had navigated their early schedule to the tune of a 5-0 start and No. 3 ranking in Class 2-1A. \n“We’d talked all year about how they were favored by far to be the No. 1 team in our district,” Northern Heights coach Greg French said. “We made that a focus for us to shoot at.” \nAfter seeing Marion escape its district opener with a 14-13 win over Chase County, Heights took dead aim at being the team to knock off the Warriors. On Friday night, the Wildcats hit their target, rallying from a 10-point halftime deficit to upset Marion 34-24. \nHeights pitched a second-half shutout and got a pair of third-quarter touchdown passes from Tucker Litke to take the lead and a fourth-quarter touchdown run from Trent Burd to seal the upset. Litke finished with an efficient night, going 9 of 13 for 147 yards and the two scores, while Burd ran for 158 yards and Theron Row added 94 rushing yards and two touchdowns. \n“The last few weeks, we’ve been playing OK, but I felt like we hadn’t been playing with the confidence and aggressiveness that we had earlier in the season,” French said. “We focused on that this week, playing more aggressive and confident. That second half our kids really turned it on and played well.” \nFrench said his team gained some confidence for Friday’s matchup from watching the game film from the Marion-Chase County contest, seeing how physical the Bulldogs had been in falling just short of their own stunner. \nBut more importantly, the Wildcats put behind them a pair of tough Flint Hills League losses to Lyndon (14-7) and Osage City (20-17). In each of the losses, Heights held leads going into the fourth quarter only to see their league rivals rally for the victory. \n“Those losses we had we just didn’t feel like we played like we were capable of in them,” French said. “In both of those games, we were in position to win and felt like we should have won, but let them slip away at the end.” \nSitting 4-2 after the Marion win, Heights very easily could be 6-0 heading into the final three weeks of the season. After graduating a strong senior class led by All-2-1A pick Donovan Read, the Wildcats entered the 2015 season with a number of question marks. \nA 21-0 win over Council Grove — the Braves’ lone loss — gave the Wildcats a big jump-start to the season. \n“We knew we were losing a lot with those seniors we had last year,” French said. “As a coach, I was more concerned with our offensive line than I was about our backs. We’ve known for a couple years that Takota Lunsford and Trent Burd were really good football players, they were just playing behind some great football players. We knew we’d be as good as anybody we would face in the running back position, but our offensive line has really stepped up this year and impressed me. We’re really outsized by everybody, but we make up for it with our aggressiveness and quickness. \n“Council Grove was huge and they’ve been a big rival for us. Going into that game I wasn’t sure how we’d stack up. That was a big confidence boost for us and showed us we could play with anybody. It was a shot in the arm we needed.” \nWith a win over Marion in the bank, Heights is in position to make the playoffs for the second time in three years. Tests still await with 5-1 Mission Valley in two weeks and rival Chase County in the finale. \nHeights takes on Herington this week. \n“We told our kids Friday night that was a big step in the right direction if we want to come out of our district,” French said. “I think our kids understand that Mission Valley and Chase County are playing very well right now and Herington is good enough if you don’t come out and play well they can get you. They’re going to be tough ones and we’ve won some of those tough ones this year and lost some. We just have to focus on doing what’s gotten us our wins so far.” FRIDAY NIGHT STARS \n■ Abilene wrapped up its second straight undefeated North Central Kansas League title, beating Clay Center 35-14.
