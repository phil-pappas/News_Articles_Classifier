Sources tell TMZ that Khloe has threatened to leave Lamar for good if he ever starts doing drugs again. ( TMZ reported last week that, per police interviews with workers at the Nevada brothel where Odom was found unconscious, the basketball star was snorting cocaine and taking \"mystery pills\" before his collapse.) As for Lamar's current health, \"He’s doing much better, still little by little,\" a source tells Us . \"He is still getting lots of treatment but getting better day by day.\" It was revealed Saturday that he suffered a dozen strokes during the medical emergency. But Khloe has even stopped staying at the hospital, though she's still visiting him, because \"he's doing OK and wanted some alone time with his kids,\" the source says.
