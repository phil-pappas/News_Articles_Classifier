We’re not getting balanced scoring like we’re used to, and that makes things tougher for the team overall.” \nLast weekend, the Runners started sluggish in their contests, giving up early leads each game. The RoadRunners found a way to battle back, eventually down 3-2, before allowing an empty net goal each night to seal consecutive 4-2 defeats. \nLanger said it is tough for his team to travel more than 10 hours for a series and leave without any points to show for it. \n“We played well portions of the games, but slow starts put us in tough positions,” Langer said. “Odessa is a much-improved hockey team, and they aren’t just going to let us crawl back into the game.” \nWith the RoadRunners battling the injury bug, Topeka will also be looking for help from two new players this weekend: defensemen Ryan Hutchinson and Colin O’Connor. \n“The guys we’re bringing in right now are to help us just get through the weekend,” Langer said. “We only had three defensemen in practice this week.” \nSpringfield (6-2-1) and Topeka will face off 12 times over the course of the season. The Jr. Blues are led by forward Brady Tomlak and goaltender Tommy Napier. Napier is 5-0-1 on the season, with 1.64 goals against average. \n“They’ve got a lot of good veterans back from last year’s team,” Langer said. “They’re going to be a tough contest, no doubt about it. We’ve got to be sharp in all areas of our game.” \nTopeka will head into the weekend’s series after only two practices this week, as the team traveled to Bonner Springs to prepare for the Jr. Blues. Landon Arena was unavailable much of the week, with preparations for Thursday’s Darius Rucker concert ongoing. \n“It’s difficult, because there’s less structure to your practice schedule,” Langer said. “We’ve just gotta figure out a way to take points and continue to improve.” \nTopeka will face the Jr. Blues at 7:05 p.m. Friday and Saturday at Landon Arena.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:30:49.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
