Randle could be seen talking a bit of smack about Green’s defense, which was a big part of the Warrior’s run to the NBA title last season. \nBut as Randle so delicately noted, Green didn’t stand a chance against the former Wildcat and seventh-overall pick in the 2014 draft, saying plainly: “He can’t guard me.” The Lakers were leading the matchup 85 to 70, before officials called the game due to slippery floor conditions. Randle is back in the lineup for the Lakers after suffering a season-ending leg injury during his very first NBA game. Good news is, the time away doesn’t seem to have affected his game or his swagger. Article written by Ricki Barker Writer of things. Watcher of sports. Wearer of blue.

I think you just went down a slippery slope, ha! Andy October 18, 2015 at 3:13 pm | Permalink | Reply \nIts just a pre-season game. No one plays too hard. Sometimes athletes need to just tone it down a bit till the regular season starts, then you play that team 3 times and then lets see how you fare in that stretch?

If I were him, I wouldn’t get too excited about my performance in a pre-season game on a wet floor in which the oposing Team’s coach was not ever there… cats paw October 18, 2015 at 8:24 pm | Permalink \nHow did Samardo Samuels do?
