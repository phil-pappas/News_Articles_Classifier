(Scott Sewell-USA TODAY Sports) The Sports Xchange \nMANHATTAN, Kan. — Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops wasn’t really worried about how his team would respond a day after facing significant travel delays in arriving for the No. 19 Sooners’ game at Kansas State. \n“Worry doesn’t do much for you,” Stoops said. \nThere wasn’t anything to worry about, it turned out. \nOklahoma dominated Kansas State in every way, rolling to a 55-0 victory over the Wildcats at Bill Snyder Family Stadium on Saturday. \nThe Sooners’ flight from Oklahoma City to Manhattan was delayed by more than eight hours, with players not arriving to their hotel rooms until after midnight — just more than 14 hours before the scheduled kickoff. \n“I said we were going to check into the hotel at 12:15 in the morning from now on,” Stoops said after the game. \nThe Sooners (5-1, 2-1 Big 12) had struggled with sluggish starts all season, including a week earlier in a surprising 24-17 loss to unranked Texas. \nBut there was nothing slow about the start against the Wildcats. \nOklahoma needed five plays and 1:05 to get on the board with a touchdown and less than seven minutes to go up by two scores. \nBaker Mayfield threw for 282 yards and five touchdowns — all the scores in the first half — to lead the dominant performance. \nKansas State had not been shut out since 2006, a streak of 234 consecutive games. \n“This is probably the most significant and major challenge that any of us have ever met,” Wildcats coach Bill Snyder said. \nKansas State (3-3, 0-3) has dropped three consecutive games. In the first two of that streak, the Wildcats led at halftime before letting the game slip away late. \nThe Sooners turned up the tempo from the start after struggling to keep much of an offensive rhythm a week earlier. \nFirst-year offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley has wanted to dial up the speed of his offense but hadn’t had sustained success before Saturday. \n“We found something this week in practice,” Riley said. “It was just the progression of this deal — learning what we have and what we don’t have, what we do and don’t do well, trying to figure out the best way to put these guys in position to success. \n“I think we found something this week. The guys did a great job taking it to the field and being ready to play. We got off to a great start and never looked back.” \nKansas State’s only significant threat to score came early in the second quarter when it finished off a nine-play drive with a 32-yard field goal that went wide right. \nThe Sooners then dialed up the tempo yet again and needed only five plays to drive 80 yards for their third touchdown. \nMayfield’s 28-yarder to Sterling Shepard was Shepard’s second touchdown catch in the game. He finished with four catches for 83 yards and two touchdowns as the Sooners racked up 568 yards of total offense. \n“The tempo allows our offense to get set and get going,” Mayfield said. “It makes the defense have to get lined up and play in a base defense. \n“Texas was able to line up and give us some crazy blitzes and when we go tempo, people can’t do that.” \nAs impressive as Oklahoma’s offense was, the defense was just as effective. \nKansas State didn’t top 100 yards of total offense until the final minute. \nBy halftime, many of the sellout crowd of 52,867 had streamed toward the exits as Oklahoma built a 35-0 lead behind Mayfield’s aerial barrage. \n“If I was sitting up there, I probably would’ve left early too,” Snyder said. “We did not do anything to deserve to keep them in the stands, and I apologize for that.” \nMayfield finished 20 of 27 before giving way to Trevor Knight at quarterback after three quarters. \nOklahoma cornerback Zack Sanchez had two of Oklahoma’s three interceptions, returning the second 38 yards for a touchdown on the first possession of the second half. \nOklahoma has won six consecutive games in Manhattan. The last time the Wildcats beat the Sooners was in 1996. \nLate in the second quarter, Kansas State switched quarterbacks, going with Kody Cook over Joe Hubener. \nCook gave the Wildcats a quick infusion of offense with a 13-yard run on his third play, but the offense stalled. \nIn the loss to Texas a week earlier, mobile quarterbacks had made things difficult on the Sooners. But Oklahoma kept Hubener bottled up from the start and kept control throughout. \nNOTES: QB Baker Mayfield’s five touchdown passes tied a school record for the most in a half.
