They will be all flying green ACBDA flags and will be easily identifiable. \n“A notice to mariners has been issued under the authority of the Minister making it an offence to enter restricted areas and to fail to obey the 5 knot order which is in place in Hamilton Harbor and the area around the race course. Marine Police will be on-hand to support Bermuda Regiment and civilian race course Marshals. \n“Reminder – the flying of drones or any radio controlled unmanned air craft is strictly prohibited in any area around the Great Sound by authority of the Civil Aviation Authority, which is a temporary restriction put in place until Monday.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:17:08.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
