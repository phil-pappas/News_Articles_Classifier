For the first time, Johnson brought his son, who has Asperger’s syndrome, to watch his bride-to-be traverse the route.\nJohnson’s fiancee, Carlee Penning, a nurse at Adventist Hinsdale Hospital who suffers from pancreatitis, hadn’t run in the Chicago Marathon since 2007.\n“We’ve got challenges,” Johnson said. “But we’re trying to kick some ass.”\nClad in a Cubs jacket and hat, Johnson stood at Hubbard and Wells, periodically checking Penning’s progress on his phone as Brown Line trains rumbled overhead.\n“She’s trying to qualify for Boston,” he said.\nStart Slideshow » Johanes Adinata, of Balikpapan, Indonesia, crosses the finish line during the 2015 Bank of America Chicago Marathon on Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015. | Ashlee Rezin/For the Sun-Times\nRunners race down LaSalle Street near Wacker Drive during the 2015 Bank of America Chicago Marathon on Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015. | Ashlee Rezin/For the Sun-Times\nJuan Mejia, of Doral, Florida, crosses the finish line during the 2015 Bank of America Chicago Marathon on Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015. | Ashlee Rezin/For the Sun-Times\nChumba wins: Bank of America Chicago Marathon\nKiplagat rolls to women’s victory: Bank of America Chicago Marathon\nMcFadden & Fearnley: Wheelers at Chicago Marathon\nOne person taking part in the marathon suffered a heart attack near Melrose and Lake Shore Drive, according to Fire Media Affairs. The person was treated by a paramedic and later hospitalized.\nWhile Johnson had a close connection to one of the runners, some who lined the route were there to offer support to each and every participant.\nWithout a particular target for their support, Valparaiso-area residents Chuck and Anne LaMotte offered kind words to dozens of runners who passed them at Ohio and Wells.\nIn years past, Chuck had Anne — a former marathoner in her own right — to aim his support at.\n“She ran. I watched,” he said.\nA very supportive banana. #ChicagoMarathon pic.twitter.com/Xdn1N8PDhz\n— Sam Charles (@samjcharles) October 11, 2015\nEven though he didn’t know any of the runners, Chuck read their nametags to offer as much personal encouragement as possible.\n“I don’t know if it does anything for them, but it’s great for me,” he said.\nTo the LaMottes, the more than 50-mile drive was a small price to pay to help inspire confidence in runners.\n“Considering they expel all this energy, you can expel some cheering them on,” Chuck said.\nMatt Johnson waits for his fiancee to run by near Hubbard and Wells during the Chicago Marathon. | Sam Charles/Sun-Times", "external_links": ["http://bullseye-prod.aggrego.org//wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/MARATHON-101215-22_56773153.jpg?o=eyJ4IjowLjUsInkiOjAuNSwid2lkdGgiOjEwMjQsImhlaWdodCI6NjgzfQ%3D%3D&s=ODIwNDA2ZTMzZjZhYmNlNmMyNGIxNTRjNTFlODlhYzQ2MzNjZjI5Yw%3D%3D);", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Photos:%20Chicago%20Marathon&url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/1021828/photos-chicago-marathon", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/MCrowd2-600x400.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/156/2015/09/transparent.gif", "http://bullseye-prod.aggrego.org//wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/MARATHON-101215-04_56773515.jpg?o=eyJ4IjowLjUsInkiOjAuNSwid2lkdGgiOjEwMjQsImhlaWdodCI6NjgzfQ%3D%3D&s=MmZlZDQ2NWM0MzM1ZTg4ZjBiY2Q0YjE5MzE5ZDFmMWJlODZiNzExZQ%3D%3D);", "https://twitter.com/samjcharles/status/653210599770472448", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChicagoMarathon?src=hash", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BivUYjtfDkk?feature=oembed", "http://t.co/Xdn1N8PDhz", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?m2w&s=100&p", "http://bullseye-prod.aggrego.org//wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/MARATHON-101215-27_56772599.jpg?o=eyJ4IjowLjUsInkiOjAuNSwid2lkdGgiOjEwMjQsImhlaWdodCI6NjgzfQ%3D%3D&s=ZWQ5NDUxZjE2OGM3NmVlNDgwM2IwZTQ5M2E1ZjNkYjNlMjQxODUyMg%3D%3D);", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/1021828/photos-chicago-marathon"], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:10:53.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
