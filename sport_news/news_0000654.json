I am happy for him, he plays well as Manchester United.\" \nMartial moved to the principality from Lyon in 2013, making 70 appearances and scoring 15 goals for Monaco before heading to Old Trafford. \nJardim, like Toulalan, completely understood the striker's desire to move on and has not been surprised by the way he has begun life at United. \n\"Anthony is a young, very good player,\" the Monaco boss said on the eve of the Europa League tie with Tottenham. \n\"Last year he played bad in the beginning of the season and after worked a lot physically and mentally. \n\"When you work in a club like Monaco with good methods and a good team, it is easy to improve and to go to a big European club.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:42:02.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
