Simon might need surgery to fix a dislocated toe. \nSeattle then promoted running back Rod Smith from the practice squad. The Hawks are searching for some depth at RB after declaring Marshawn Lynch out for Sunday's game. Beast Mode is battling a strained hamstring. Plus, Fred Jackson is trying to comeback from a high ankle strain suffered in the Lions game on Monday night. \nSmith ran the ball 10 times in preseason for 70 yards. He also caught six passes for 27 yards. \nSimon's status hurts the defensive backs. Seattle is already down Marcus Burley. He had surgery to fix his broken thumb and won't be back for at least three weeks. Plus, Deshawn Shead is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game with the Bengals. He's battling a hip injury.
