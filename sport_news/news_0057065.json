(HUBBLE RAY SMITH/Miner) Hubble Ray Smith Miner Staff Reporter KINGMAN - Lee Williams High School won't be taking winless Kingman Academy lightly when the teams meet at 7 p.m. today at Kingman High School, a neutral field selected to accommodate a crowd that's expected to be larger than normal.Lee Williams (1-5 overall, 1-2 section) won its first game last week, 42-20, in their inaugural match-up with Kingman High, and coach Ray Smith knows Kingman Academy (0-6, 0-3) would like nothing more than to log its first win against another hometown team.\"We're 1-5. We're in the same boat they are,\" said Smith, assistant coach and offensive coordinator who has taken over speaking with reporters in place of head coach Eugene Kramer. \"Everybody wants to win. They're starving for wins. \"There's no doubt in my mind (Academy) coach (Dan) Stroup will have them ready.\"Smith said the Volunteers worked hard this week in practice, and nothing has changed in the regimen to prepare for the Kingman Academy Tigers. He wants the defense to get off initial blocks and run to the ball.Lee Williams won last year's game against the Tigers, 14-8, in overtime, and Smith remembers how the defense had a hard time containing the Tigers.\"They've got two good backs that scare me. Defensively, we know we've got to tackle well. Those backs will come right at us,\" the coach said.The Tigers are led by running backs Jordan McDowell-Seybert, who gained 96 yards last week against defending Division IV champion River Valley, and Clayton Holloway.Lee Williams running back Nate Cottrell had his best performance of the year against Kingman, rushing for 189 yards and four touchdowns. Quarterback Daniel Mazon threw for 148 yards and two touchdowns.The game will be broadcast by KJZK 90.7 FM and streamed live on the Internet at www.Mohavetvnews.com/livesports.
