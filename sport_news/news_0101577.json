Maldonado did so with 2:04.716 before times tumbled and Hamilton, with 1:59.393, moved eight-tenths of a second clear of the field. \nWithin seconds, Spaniard Carlos Sainz lost control and crashed at Turn Four, wrecking the front of his car to leave Toro Rosso with a major repair job just five hours ahead of the race. \nIt was his second crash at successive events, following his high-speed accident in Russia from which he was lucky to escape unhurt, and resulted in a red flag stoppage. \nAt the time, Hamilton was on top ahead of Ricciardo and Kvyat, but both Ferrari drivers had failed to clock a lap. \n“It’s just as wet out there as it was yesterday,” said Hamilton. \nThe session resumed after a 10-minute break, with Rosberg jumping briefly to second in marginally improved conditions, four-tenths adrift of his teammate, before Hamilton responded by slicing 1.3 seconds off his previous best lap. \nRosberg then went top before Vettel, saddled already with a 10-place grid penalty for taking a new power unit, glanced the wall in a spin at Turn 10 and pitted, Ricciardo responding with a 1:57.163. Hamilton, in traffic, was third, but regained control in 1:56.871. \n“People are getting quicker, Nico, we need to keep setting times,” Mercedes told Rosberg as the action turned frantic as everyone lapped fast in a bid to beat the weather before the flag. \nWhen it came, it meant an early exit for Sainz, at the back, along with the two Manor Marussia men Will Stevens and American Alex Rossi, in 19th and 18th respectively and Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson, in the two Saubers on the day the team celebrated their 400th Grand Prix entry. \nIn Q2, Hamilton and Rosberg soon topped the times before Hulkenberg spun at Turn 10, followed by Button, Verstappen and Kvyat as the rain intensified, Rosberg holding the ascendancy. \nHamilton then completed a full 360-spin at Turn 10, as did Raikkonen, both men showing phenomenal car control to catch their cars. \n“They are red flag conditions,” said Vettel as it ended with Rosberg on top and Alonso, Bottas, Grosjean, Button and Maldonado missing the cut. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:59:35.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
