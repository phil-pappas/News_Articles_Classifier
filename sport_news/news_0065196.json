It was the first meeting of the season between Ashland-Greenwood and Arlington, who saw a nine-game win streak snapped two days earlier. \nNo worries, they may have started a new one, \nMariah Kaup and Shelby Kaup each had seven kills to spark the Arlington attack, which was spread out in the victory. Junior Jacque Bartosh and sophomore Grace Volk each registered six kills. Volk and Mariah Kaup each had four service aces, while Shelby Kaup led the way defensively with three blocks. \nOn a night when it needed to be, the Arlington defense came through. Senior Savanah Reed had a game-high 25 digs to make stringing together points tough on the Bluejays. Senior Hannah Marquardt chipped in with seven. \nArlington is back at home on Tuesday night, when 6-20 Syracuse comes to town for a 6:30 matchup. \nArlington 3, Ashland-Greenwood 0 \nA-G (12-11) 23 22 23 0 \nArlington (16-7) 25 25 25 0 Ã—", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:09:38.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
