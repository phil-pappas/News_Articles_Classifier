However, I feel a credo I've long relied on could help some people today. Understand that life is not fair, it will always be not fair, and act accordingly. Last week was a sports week for “fair,” what with the Cubs and Pirates — two of the best three teams in the National League, if not all of baseball — forced to play a one-and-done game for the right to play St. Louis, the other of the three. This will also be a week for “fair,” given that takeout slide at second base. A takeout in every sense — L.A.'s Chase Utley broke Ruben Tejada's leg and helped L.A. come back to beat the Mets on Saturday night. A slide? It was that too, thought Utley's concern with second base seemed minimal. We are very concerned with “fair” these days. As we should be, even if it's an imperfect pursuit. The everyone-gets-a-turn NFL overtime isn't among our finest inventions, and mucking up these one-game Wild Card playoffs would be a similar mistake. Want to know what's really unfair? Playoffs, period. Baseball plays for six months, basically throws out those results, and plays one month with a third of the league for everything. Know how 100 wins is a benchmark of the greatest teams? Among the last 12 100-game winners, there's one world champion and seven who didn't win one playoff series. In the six-division era, the teams with the best regular-season record each year have totaled eight of 40 pennants and four of 20 World Series. The Red Sox of 2007 and 2013 are two, the latter coming against a Cardinals team that matched their 97 wins. Shane Victorino was 2-for-13 in that series, capping a .216 postseason. You remember him as an October hero. Funny how a small sample can obscure reality. The Series existed for seven decades as a meeting of two league champions, leagues that existed essentially as separate entities. It made it nearly three more as the end of a four-division, four-team tournament. The ideals from whence it sprung are long buried, replaced by ensuring pennant dreams across the country and a month's worth of primetime, must-see baseball to be consumed by key demographics. Is the trade worth it? Sure, but don't miss that's exactly what it is. If only the Utley play could be dissected that easily. Heck, current and former players can't even agree. Cal Ripken, who turned many a double play and whose whole legend balances on never getting Tejada'd, said “it looked a lot worse than it was.” Chipper Jones, rarely accused of playing less than full tilt, tweeted “that is not how u 'go in hard'!” “Utley showing why I always called him a winner,” proclaimed Victorino, his teammate for eight years. “That was a really weak attempt at a slide,” said Jose Reyes, Tejada's Mets teammate in 2010-11. Put me in the Chipper camp. Better yet, put me with Pedro. “If you tell Utley to teach kids to slide on second base,” Martinez — no stranger to throwing inside – said, “would he teach them the way he (slid) tonight?” A couple things we can safely assume. Utley wasn't trying to break Tejada's leg any more than he has been going in hard for 13 seasons – including five years ago, when he peeved the Mets with a slide on Tejada in Philadelphia. (The shortstop wasn't injured.) Saturday's play was called correctly: Utley was within reach of the bag – unlike a takeout slide he made last month in San Diego -- and Tejada never tagged second because of a bad toss. (Neither did Utley, but that's apparently fine.) We can also safely note in the moment, it was a savage play. Laughable. And this winter, the takeout slide will be history. Right next to the home-plate collision, the lead-with-your-helmet NFL hit, the hard NBA foul that doesn't cause a brawl and, before too long, hockey fights. When Pittsburgh's Jung Ho Kang had his knee blown out on a takeout slide in mid-September, the talk got going in earnest. It will be the other highlight on the loop with Utley's, interspersed with the requisite lamenting of how much the game has changed. That's what it does. That's what life does. Action, right or wrong, stemming from experience. A century ago, when the World Series was a true meeting of a season's best, Ty Cobb's slides were closer to dropkicks. 'Spikes up' was common. So were beanballs. The players who delivered them all weren't bad people because they did it. They played the way they were taught, the way the veterans taught them. The veterans change. The lessons change. The society changes. The money changes. In 2007, a study calculated that before World War II, the average MLB career lasted 4.3 years. From 1969-1993, that grew to 6.85. The reasons are obvious. Better fitness. More knowledge. Easier travel. A refined sport in which, increasingly, we value the athlete over the big hit, the fight and the foul. We value the athlete, if only because of the increased financial investment, in ways the previous generation never did. In both our examples, something is lost. A month's worth of winner-take-all baseball is the tradeoff for devaluing the regular season. Longer, more lucrative careers will be the tradeoff for the big hits and the grit disappearing. Both are fair. Both are unfair. Sometimes, we move the right way. Sometimes, we move the wrong. Such is life. Jon Couture covers the Red Sox for The Standard-Times.
