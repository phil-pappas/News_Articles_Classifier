He was spotted in a club suite at Montreal's Stade Saputo just a few days after getting the release from RSL, and he also had multiple other reported and rumored offers in various leagues, sports and businesses around the world. \nBut in the end Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, Toronto FC's parent company, won out, ending a nearly yearlong search for the right man, according to the Sun's report. \nThe two-time MLS Executive of the Year, who helped RSL win MLS Cup in 2009, joins former general manager Garth Lagerwey (Seattle) and head coach Jason Kreis (New York City FC) in going from small-market Salt Lake City to a larger demographic. He will officially begin his role later this week for Toronto, which is just one point away from clinching its first-ever playoff spot. \nToronto FC hosts the New York Red Bulls Wednesday night. \nIn his new role, Manning is also reunited with former RSL Academy director Greg Vanney, who was named head coach in Toronto Aug. 31, 2014. Vanney was previously the director of the Casa Grande, Arizona-based academy from 2008-11. \n\"I look forward to working with Tim Bezbatchenko, Greg Vanney and the TFC staff at this exciting time, and I am grateful to Mr. Tanenbaum and the MLSE ownership for this opportunity to come to a world-class city and club to help make its championship vision a reality,\" Manning said in a statement released by the club.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:43:57.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
