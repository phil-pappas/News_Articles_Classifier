Skipper Ashley Williams - looking for his first international goal - saw his low header saved, but Ramsey was quickest to the rebound and fired it home to put Wales in front. \nRamsey nearly added a second on the hour, showing some wonderful control before charging past several players, only to see his low effort whistle just wide of the far post. \nIn a stop-start encounter, which saw seven Andorra players booked, it was hard for Wales to find any rhythm and open the floodgates. \nAnd it wasn't until the 86th minute that they added a second. The impressive Ben Davies charged in from the left flank before firing in a low cross, which eventually worked its way to Bale, who could only scuff his effort, but it was still enough to squirm past Pol and secure the victory for the hosts. \nColeman's side finish the campaign with seven clean sheets in 10 games and the best defensive record in Group B, and they now start preparing for their first major finals in 58 years.
