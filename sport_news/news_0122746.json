This year, that’s the only option.\nSo much has been talked and written about surrounding the Cubs and their hopes of ending the longest World Series appearance and championship drought in baseball history. But no matter who wins this year, it will be the first time in at least two decades.\n2015 will be 1st postseason in which all 4 LCS teams have NOT won a World Series title in previous 20 seasons (LCS began in 1969)\n— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 15, 2015\nSure, it’s been a lot longer for Cubs fans to wait than any of the remaining teams, but that’s an impressive drought for all five remaining teams.\nLast World Series championship for remaining teams: Toronto Blue Jays: 1993 Los Angeles Dodgers: 1988 New York Mets: 1986 Kansas City Royals: 1985 Chicago Cubs: 1908 Making the remaining teams that much more fun is the youth on the remaining teams. The Cubs have showcased young players all season long, as have the Mets.\nThe Blue Jays feature one of the strongest closers in all of baseball with Roberto Osuna, who was born in 1995.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/654493853068750848"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:06:09.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
