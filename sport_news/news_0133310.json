Friday night, the Havelock Rams and West Craven Eagles met on the football field in a battle of unbeaten teams. Havelock made just a few more plays and took advantage of West Craven mistakes to prevail and ride out of Vanceboro with a 22-6 win. “We got a win against a really good football team tonight,” Havelock coach Jim Bob Bryant said. “I told the boys that nothing worth having comes easy. There’s nothing better than beating West Craven at West Craven.” While star running back Tony Sharpe was held down by West Craven’s defense and an ankle injury, junior quarterback Corey Cooper and his stable of receivers put the onus on their shoulders. Cooper threw for 204 yards on the night with two touchdowns and an interception. Cooper’s favorite target was 6-foot-2 junior Quinzel Lockhart, who hauled in four passes for 113 yards and a score. Havelock’s other two scores came off two Cooper 1-yard runs, one of which was after the Eagles botched a snap on a punt try that set Havelock up at the five. Strengths of both teams – the defensive front four – were locked in a stop versus stop battle for most of the night. West Craven was forced to punt six times, while Havelock kicked it away on three occasions. Havelock senior defensive end Makai Collins had two sacks of West Craven quarterback Jarred Arthur to lead the way for the Ram defense which held West Craven to 165 yards of total offense. “It was a hard-fought game up there in the trenches tonight. They are really good on the offensive line and disciplined but we just kept bringing it to them,” he said. Arthur was filling in for Eagles’ star quarterback Darious Abrams who did not play due to coaches’ decision. He gave it his best shot and passed for 149 yards but the West Craven offense just couldn’t match points with the Rams. The lone Eagle touchdown came in the waning seconds of the second quarter when Arthur hit senior running back Danny Harvey for a 4-yard screen pass and a score. That came after Harvey reeled off a 38-yard gain on a screen. That one thing that worked best for the Eagles was adjusted on and stopped by the Rams in the second half. “They made some great halftime adjustments and we wanted to make them beat us by throwing the ball,” West Craven coach Matt Riggsbee said. “We have to make some better decisions as a team and cut out mistakes.” Page 2 of 2 - Collins said that he and his defensive teammates just modified their coverages in the second half to better defend the Eagles’ short passing game. “Me and Tyiyon (Johnson) started dropping back in the second half to defend against that play,” Collins said. “Just doing more drop coverages to stop the thing they were hurting us the most with.” The win improves Havelock to 8-0 overall and 3-0 in the Coastal 3A Conference. West Craven falls to 6-1 (2-1) with the loss. The win extends Havelock’s road-win streak to 35 and its conference streak to 30.
