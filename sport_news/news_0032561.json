Pedrosa wins Japan Moto GP ahead of Rossi \nDani Pedrosa came from behind to grab his first Moto GP win of the season at the Japan Grand Prix on Sunday, while championship leader Valentino Rossi finished second. \nThe Spanish Honda rider clocked 46min 50.767sec, 8.573sec ahead of Rossi and 12.127sec ahead of Jorge Lorenzo on his Yamaha. \nThe results meant the Italian stretched his championship points lead over Lorenzo to 18 with three races to go. \nPedrosa, who was placed fourth early on in the race, stunned rivals and spectators with his electrifying charge from lap 15 of the 24-lap race. He stormed past Rossi and then Lorenzo two laps later. \n“I couldn’t go fast in the beginning,” Pedrosa said. \n“But at the end, my pace was faster and could win the race. I am very happy.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:18:28.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
