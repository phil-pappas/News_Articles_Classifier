The USC Trojans fan is now playing college football in the Los Angeles area for Division II Azusa Pacific in Azusa, California. After redshirting a season ago, Ramirez is starting on special teams and is a backup defender for the Cougars. Azusa Pacific is 3-2 and Ramirez has played in all five games, registering three tackles from his safety position. Ramirez (5-foot-8, 185 pounds) starred as a linebacker at Havelock but was switched to safety by the Azusa Pacific coaching staff upon arriving to town. \"After playing linebacker for four years in high school, I knew I didn't have college linebacker size,\" Ramirez said. \"Coaches brought me in and talked to me about playing strong safety and I said I would do anything to help the team.\" Ramirez said that not playing a year was definitely tough after winning multiple state championships and playing nearly every down in high school. \"I broke both of my thumbs my first year here and it was tough because I could not really show them what I could do,\" he said. \"Even now, though I am playing and not starting, I am going 100 percent every day and just doing all I can.\" Ramirez also said a major factor that got him prepared for a higher level of football was playing at a program like Havelock. \"Oh playing for coach Bryant and at Havelock, I have huge thanks to give to all of my high school coaches for preparing me for college football,\" he said. \"Our coach at Azusa, coach (Victor) Santa Cruz, he's a lot like coach Bryant. He's tough and demands a lot.\" Ramirez is still learning his new position and the differnet kinetic movements that come with the safety spot as compared to playing linebacker. Nevertheless, there is one constant at any defensive position, the thing Ramirez excells at - tackling. \"Definitely the backpedaling insatead of side-to-side was and still is a big adjustment for me,\" Ramirez said. \"I just want to continue to learn everything that I can and play football as long as I can.\" Ramirez has only known winning in football and he will try to avoid becoming a stranger to that during the rest of his career at Azusa Pacific.
