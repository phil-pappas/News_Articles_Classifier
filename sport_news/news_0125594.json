The Warriors, who trailed 1-0 at halftime, are now 4-4-1 in league play. Haley Berryman scored the tying goal in the 63rd minute and registered the tie-breaking marker at 66 minutes. Jaz Lemos added an insurance goal at the 86-minute mark to give WWCC a 3-1 lead. Lemos assisted on both of Berryman’s goals and was set up for her scoring attempt by Courtney Wells. Yakima claimed an own goal in the 89th minute, but drew no closer. “The girls battled all game long,” WWCC coach Jordan Hacker said. “We kept the pressure on the Yakima backbone the entire game. “Sam (Filingeri-Oleson), Haley, Jaz, and Courtney had fantastic games,” Hacker said. “Their work rate put us over the top.” Hacker also praised Madi Woody, Brittany McBride, Sadie Blaisdell, and Daisy Nateras. “Each girl contributed when they were called upon to do it,” Hacker said of Woody, McBride, and Blaisdell. “Daisy stepped up really big for us. She filled in as a defender and did a fantastic job standing players up and keeping the play in front of her. It was a great team win in the end.” Walla Walla hosts North Idaho Saturday at noon.
