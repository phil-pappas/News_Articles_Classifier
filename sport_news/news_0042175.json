Hamilton has now collected 302 points to lead the drivers’ standings and can win his third career title at the next race in Texas, while his Mercedes team retained the constructors’ title, Xinhua reported. Hamilton started second behind main rival and teammate Nico Rosberg, on Sunday, who failed to finish due to a throttle problem. Hamilton then cruised to victory in one hour, 37 minutes and 11.024 seconds, leading by 5.9 seconds over Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, with Sergio Perez third for Force India, 23 seconds further behind . Hamilton’s 42nd career win took him past his boyhood hero Ayrton Senna on the all-time list and it was Hamilton’s ninth victory of the season and the 12th for Mercedes. With four races to go, Hamilton leads Vettel by 66 points and Rosberg by 73. Mercedes’ second straight constructors’ title was decided after the race when the stewards penalised Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen for crashing into Valtteri Bottas’ Williams on the last lap. Felipe Massa was fourth for Williams, with Russian driver Daniil Kvyat elevated to fifth because of Raikkonen’s penalty.
