The penalty should have moved the ball to the Cowboys’ 45 and made it first-and-20. Instead, it was first-and-15 because the first-down marker was moved back 5 yards with the 10-yard penalty, instead of staying at the K-State 35-yard line. \nOklahoma State quarterback Mason Rudolph was sacked for a 7-yard loss, which should have made it second-and-27. Rudolph then completed a 4-yard pass to set up what should have been third-and-23 — which the officials had as third-and-18. On third down, Rudolph found Marcell Ateman for a 19-yard gain, giving the Cowboys a first down at the K-State 40, instead of the original first down mark at the 35. It should have been fourth-and-5. \n“I really wasn’t aware of it,” K-State head coach Bill Snyder said during Monday’s Big 12 teleconference. “When the situation took place, it didn’t seem as though they had made enough yardage to make the first down. \n“I certainly didn’t question it and had no idea.” \nOklahoma State wound up scoring a touchdown on the drive with 46 seconds remaining in the first half, narrowing K-State’s lead to 28-20 at halftime. The Cowboys went on to kick a 37-yard field in the final minute of the game to beat the Wildcats. \n“Accuracy and adherence to Conference policies and officiating mechanics are vital to the proper administration of the rules in all games,” Big 12 supervisor of officials Walt Anderson said in a release Sunday. “Disciplinary actions will be addressed with both the field officials and the chain crew.” \nOklahoma State’s official play-by-play stat book handed out to media has the holding penalty initially labeled as first-and-20 before changing to first-and-15 without a play being run. Television viewers saw the correct first-down markings on the field, as well, as Ateman fell far short of the first-down line, yet was awarded a first down. \nSnyder said there really is no system in place to make sure the down and distance is correct on the field. \n“Maybe we need a system,” he said. “We like to labor under the assumption that those things will be taken care of by other people.” \nK-State returns to action this Saturday when the Wildcats host No. 2 TCU at 6:30 p.m. on FOX. The Wildcats’ game Oct. 17 at home against Oklahoma will begin at 2:30 p.m. on either ABC, ESPN or ESPN2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:09:45.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
