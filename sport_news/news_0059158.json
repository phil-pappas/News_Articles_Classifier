Dolce sent this out shortly after White tweeted the news about Hendricks.\nSad to hear. I hope Johny is ok. \" @danawhite : Hendricks vs Woodley off the card due to Hendricks weight cut issues. pic.twitter.com/Q2kdFaK3zw \"\nâ” Mike DOLCE (@TheDolceDiet) October 2, 2015 Before Hendricks' bout with Matt Brown at UFC 185, which was the first fight he had after that horrible weight cut, he talked with Ariel Helwani about why he chose to not partner with Dolce anymore (at the 5:09 mark).\nHendricks recently told the Morning News that the incident at UFC 181 nearly knocked him into retirement. However, he said that the incident did change his career for the better.\n\"Now it can further my career instead of me walking away,\" he said Wednesday. \"I might have had one fight left in me. If I win that fight [against Robbie Lawler], I don't change my diet. We probably don't change everything that we are doing. The next fight, the same thing happens and I'm probably like, 'Dude. Screw it. I'm done. I don't want to cut weight like that.' That's where I was at after that fight. It was 50-50. Fifty percent that I was going to quit and retire or fifty percent that I was going to continue to do it. We ended up sticking with it.\"\nBefore UFC 185, Hendricks spoke with the Morning News' Mark Francescutti about how he cut weight before fights. The following comes from his story, which can be found in its entirety here :\nHe [Hendricks] will sit in a hot tub for 20 minutes, take a short break to dip in a cold pool, then go back into the hot tub. The process could take several hours to lose 10-12 pounds.\n\"I go up and hot tub with him,\" Christina Hendricks, his wife, said. \"It sounds like it might be OK, but even 15 minutes in, you're sweating so bad, you're like, 'Get me out of there.'\"\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://t.co/By3P6jg2FO", "http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/2/9439841/johny-hendricks-forced-out-of-ufc-192-fight-after-being-rushed-to", "http://t.co/Q2kdFaK3zw", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/other-sports/moresportsheadlines/2015/09/29/johny-hendricks-bigger-long-time-better-place-cutting-weight-ahead-ufc-192", "https://twitter.com/danawhite", "https://twitter.com/danawhite/status/649963148057841665", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsAsIES-MF4", "http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/TheDolceDiet/status/649964932797063172", "https://twitter.com/bokamotoESPN/status/649966489693368320"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:48:11.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
