He is smarter than you. He is luckier than you. Whatever you think is supposed to happen, I’m telling you, the exact reverse opposite of that is gonna happen, OK?”\nIn this NLCS, the Mets have been smarter than the Cubs. They have been luckier than the Cubs, too.\nAnd when the Mets strike out with two outs and a runner on third base? They pull within one victory of the World Series.\nThis crazy Mets season produced its craziest inning yet Tuesday night, and the top of the sixth’s fittingly fortunate outcome had to make their loyal fan base, emotionally battered for so long, feel blessed — far more like angels than devils. It’s all over but the clinching after the Mets beat the Cubs, 5-2, in Game 3 of the NLCS at Wrigley Field.\n“All you can do is laugh right there,” said Michael Conforto, who delivered the Mets’ game-winning whiff. “Things were going right.”\n“Funny how it works out,” Lucas Duda said.\nUp three games to none, the Mets need just one more victory to reach their first Fall Classic since 2000, and you easily can see rookie Steven Matz wrapping it up in Wednesday’s Game 4 and giving everyone some much-needed rest.\nYou can foresee such a result because the Mets are rolling every way a baseball team can roll — offensively, defensively, metaphysically and so on. Tuesday’s top of the sixth inning serves as Exhibit A.\nWhen Cubs rookie Jorge Soler blasted a solo homer in the fourth inning off Mets starter Jacob deGrom, tying the game at 2-2 and neutralizing Daniel Murphy’s record-tying homer in a fifth consecutive game, you wondered whether the Cubs would find their footing and defend their home turf. But Yoenis Cespedes started the sixth with a single against Cubs reliever Trevor Cahill, and then came lucky break No. 1:\nDuda, mired in a deep slump (though he had singled in his previous at-bat) and looking at the standard shift against him, decided to try to lay down a bunt — though he had just one sacrifice hit (in 2011) and one bunt hit (in 2014) on his résumé.\n“First and foremost, I was trying to move Cespy over,” Duda said. “Nobody out. Obviously [I’m] not swinging the bat like I’d like, so might as well try to be as productive as I can. Second of all, they were shifting, so I thought maybe I could get a hit out of it.”\nThe ball went virtually straight down and bounced fair, appearing to surprise even Duda.\n“It hit the ground kind of funny,” he said. \nAnd though the Cubs recovered to throw out Duda at first base, the first baseman had successfully moved the lead run into scoring position.\nCespedes stole third base during Travis d’Arnaud’s at-bat, yet when d’Arnaud grounded out to Kris Bryant at third, keeping Cespedes anchored, it appeared that the Mets might be blowing an opportunity. Far more so when Conforto swung at and missed a Cahill knuckle-curve for strike three.\nExcept that Cubs catcher Miguel Montero failed just as much as Conforto to catch up to the ball, so as the nasty pitch rolled toward the backstop, Cespedes rolled toward home plate for the tiebreaking run as Conforto reached first safely.\n“[Michael Cuddyer] actually came up to me and asked me, ‘Is that the biggest strikeout of your career right there?’ ” Conforto said.\nWilmer Flores followed with a line drive that moved past a diving Soler, and when the ball became lodged in Wrigley’s outfield wall ivy, Conforto had to stop at third on the ground-rule double, as baseball’s rule book states clearly. Mets manager Terry Collins argued in vain for Conforto to be allowed home.\nThe contention wound up moot, as the Mets added a pair of insurance runs in the seventh, and deGrom and the Mets’ bullpen kept the Cubs quiet.\nNothing goes terribly wrong for the Mets nowadays. Even when it feels wrong, it turns right. Yes, this Mets season continues to break good. \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under jacob degrom ,  michael conforto ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs ,  travis d'arnaud ,  yoenis cespedes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:00:46.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
