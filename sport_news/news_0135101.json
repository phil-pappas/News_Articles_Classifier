More importantly, Charles Jones showed that he can run the ball effectively. At times, the Wildcats have shown the ability to throw the ball well too. K-State appears to be its its best when there is balance between the two. The problem, as of late, however, is that this team seems to lack a real offensive identity, so it’s anyone’s guess as to which team will show up — the one that pounds it on the ground or the one that airs it out. \n...when the Sooners have the ball Oklahoma might just have the best running back in the Big 12 in Samaje Perine, but the Sooners relied heavily on new quarterback Baker Mayfield to carry much of the load this season. The Texas Tech transfer has not disappointed either. He’s tossed 14 touchdowns to just three interceptions and has the Sooners’ air attack moving. But one can’t count Perine out of the equation just yet. When the bruising back does get the ball, he can still make any team in the Big 12 pay. \n...on special teams K-State’s return game has been held together with bandages in recent weeks — kickoff returner Morgan Burns sat out last week and punt returner Dominique Heath missed some time at Oklahoma State. The Wildcats rely on the return game to create field position and when things are at their best, the occasional touchdown — especially against teams like the Sooners. K-State needs to get something going on special teams. It could make the difference on Saturday. RELATED ARTICLE Wildcats out to prove something against OU \nThe 2012 game was vital in the Wildcats’ charge toward an eventual No. 1 ranking in the BCS. This year’s edition could have a similar impact on K-State’s season, as the Wildcats look to keep pace in a wild Big 12 race. \nIn two starts against the Kansas State football team, Oklahoma quarterback Trevor Knight played some of the best football of his college career. \nBut when the Sooners make the trip to Manhattan for Saturday’s 2:30 p.m. kick against the Wildcats, it won’t be Knight under center. \nThe redshirt junior lost his job to Texas Tech transfer Baker Mayfield, who has led the 19th-ranked Sooners to a 4-1 start to the season, with last week’s 24-17 loss to the Longhorns in the Red River Showdown the only blemish. \nWith the ability to throw downfield efficiently, Mayfield brings a different skill set than the Wildcats saw from Knight. \n“I think he’s obviously a great thrower, but what makes him so dangerous, he’s hard to bring down,” linebacker Will Davis said. “If you watch the film, he breaks a lot of tackles. He may not be Trevone-Boykin fast, but he’s still plenty fast enough.” \nMayfield has thrown for more than 1,500 yards through five games and has 14 touchdowns to just three interceptions on the season. He also has four touchdowns on the ground. \nK-State head coach Bill Snyder said Mayfield has stepped in and taken control of the Oklahoma offense. \n“I think he’s a poised young guy,” Snyder said. “I think he’s taken command of the offense in such a way that he’s garnered a great deal of respect from the other players. I think he throws the ball extremely well. He’s another one of those dual guys. He can bring it down and bring it out. He’s been good with scrambles and good on the option-type, zone-read stuff as everybody runs it and he’s made good decisions with that. \n“Probably at the top of the list, and that’s not to negate any of his physical attributes, because he’s more than capable there, I just think his leadership and his presence on the field is beneficial to Oklahoma.” \nWhile Knight was known as a true dual-threat quarterback, Mayfield is less likely to carry the ball on designed runs. \nLinebacker Elijah Lee said Mayfield lands somewhere in the middle between what Oklahoma State’s Mason Rudolph and TCU’s Trevone Boykin showed in back-to-back weeks against the Wildcats. \n“Boykin’s that runner and a big play maker,” Lee said. “Rudolph is that guy that can sling it. Mayfield is one of those guys who is going to create for his offense and be athletic and run around. I feel like the preparation for the other two quarterbacks has us ready for this quarterback.” \nDefensive tackle Travis Britz said containing Mayfield on scrambles is key. \n“We’ve seen Boykin now and understand our limitations and what we need to improve upon,” he said. “Baker Mayfield is that same type of quarterback, we just need to understand that if he sees that open lane he’s going to run to it. We can’t give him that open lane.” \nOf course, Mayfield isn’t the only weapon in OU’s arsenal. \nBruising running back Samaje Perine is back for his sophomore campaign and at 5-foot-10, 230 pounds, is one of the most difficult backs to tackle in the Big 12. After averaging more than 7 yards per carry as a Freshman All-American, Perine has been less productive as a sophomore, averaging 3.1 yards per carry and just 364 yards on the season. \n“It all starts with Baker Mayfield,” Davis said. “He’s a great quarterback, but you can’t forget about Samaje Perine. He’s a beast back there. He’s a load. If he gets going downhill, he’s hard to stop. \n“He can run over anyone in the Big 12, there’s no doubt about it. He’s a stud. I think they’re versatile and they have balance. I think people thought they would lean on the run game going into the year, and they’ve really been pretty balanced.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:32:53.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
