Utah takes different trail in preseason loss to Blazers “ Cabbage, man, I’ve been eating that since I was five or six years old. Cabbage with hot sauce on it — I know it’s a little weird, but it’s good.”\nRodney Hood\nSALT LAKE CITY — Last year Rodney Hood was a pleasant surprise for the Utah Jazz, accomplishing much more on the floor than could be expected from a rookie who was the No. 23 draft pick.\nHood averaged 8.7 points in 21 minutes per game, but he also missed 32 games because of a variety of injuries, including problems with both feet.\nTo keep himself on the floor more this year, Hood has worked hard in the offseason and continues to work as the regular season approaches.\n“I know a lot more about taking care of your body day to day,’’ he said. “I stayed in the weight room and really got stronger. I’ve been doing Delos system, which has helped my feet a lot and I’m staying on top of it and getting treatment every day. Even when I’m feeling good, I’m continuing to get treatment. I feel good right now.’’\nHood had his best outing of the preseason Sunday night when he started and scored 15 points with four rebounds in just 14 minutes of action.\nPOSTING UP: Hood was able to use his 6-foot-8 height against smaller guards last year, but he acknowledges he was too quick to try to shoot over his opponents.\n“We’re using me more on the pick and roll and I’m being more patient finding spots to post up more against guards,’’ he said. “Last year I could shoot over a lot of guys, but as far as posting up, I really couldn’t do it because I was too impatient. But I’ve done a lot of work on it and getting confidence.’’\nCABBAGE KID: Hood was asked about cabbage being one of his favorite foods after he was quoted about it on the Jazz broadcast Sunday night.\n“Cabbage, man, I’ve been eating that since I was five or six years old,’’ he said. “My grandparents used to cook it every Wednesday and I used to go over to their house just to eat that. Cabbage with hot sauce on it — I know it’s a little weird, but it’s good.''\nSUNDAY LOSS: In Sunday night’s loss at Portland, the Jazz blew a 20-point fourth-quarter lead as coach Quin Snyder chose to play a lineup of third-string Jazz players such as Bryce Cotton, Chris Johnson, Treveon Graham and Jeff Withey against a Blazer squad that included starters Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum.\nThe Jazz were outscored 50-27 in the fourth quarter and overtime period in a 116-111 loss, but Snyder wasn’t worried about it.\n“It’s a tough situation to be in — a 20-point lead in an NBA game can evaporate rather quickly,’’ he said. “We scored the ball well for three quarters and then at the end of the game, there were errors that hurt us. It was a good opportunity for the other guys who have been working really hard to play. It was great for those guys to get a chance to compete and for us to be able to see them.’’\nJAZZ NOTES: The Jazz went about an hour over their scheduled practice time Monday as Snyder called it a “mental day,’’ saying his team needed to make up for their slippage defensively since the trip to Hawaii . . . The Jazz play two home games this week: Tuesday night against Oklahoma City and Thursday night against Denver, which will conclude the preseason schedule . . . The Idaho Stampede, Utah’s D-League team, will get the No. 1 pick in the D-League Draft on Oct. 31 in New York, the NBA announced Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:23:38.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
