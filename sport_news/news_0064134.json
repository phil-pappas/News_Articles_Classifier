It was known well in advance that the production of pulses would be lower this year as bad weather in March and April had shrunk the total sown area by 10 million hectares. Two successive years of deficient rain added to the growersâ€™ troubles. Commodity price movements can be monitored through futures trading. Yet the government slept over the escalating situation even though it had set up a Rs 500-crore price stabilisation fund. And then, it seems, the government realised that there was an election in Bihar and price rise could spoil its chances of victory. What it has done in a hurry is what should not be done in such a situation. Raids on hoarders/speculators make headlines and may even provide temporary relief but these are steps reminiscent of the Inspector Raj era. If the government starts targeting stockists every time prices of a commodity shoot up by invoking the Essential Commodities Act, it would discourage fresh private investment in cold storages and warehouses. Futures trading does not cause a price hike in itself unless the market is rigged for which there is a regulator. The ban was unnecessary. Prices rise usually due to shortages and there are two ways to counter this: increase domestic production with incentives to growers and make timely imports when necessary. Producers of pulses do not get as much government help as do cereal and sugarcane farmers. Even if inadequate, there is a budgetary support for checking price fluctuations. Government agencies can build buffer stocks of essential food items and offload these in the open market whenever the situation warrants it. As a long-term solution, the area under pulses needs to be increased. Pulses are grown mostly in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Since pulses require less irrigation, water-stressed states like Punjab and Haryana can be incentivised to shift from paddy to pulses. India cannot do without imports since the domestic consumption of 23 million tonnes is far excess of local production. Imports need not be a panicky exercise but a long-term, routine stratagem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:42:53.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
