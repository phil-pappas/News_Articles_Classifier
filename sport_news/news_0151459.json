Two football teams desperate for a win can’t wait for the 100th Governor’s Cup game to kick off. After a few weeks of losses, the Rhode Island Rams (0-4) and Brown Bears (0-2) both feel that if they can grab a victory, their seasons will quickly point towards greener pastures. Both own reasons to believe they’ll be the team accepting the Cup from Governor Raimondo. “It’s Brown week. We put a great amount of emphasis on this game,” said Jim Fleming, the Rhody coach. “One of our goals of every season is always to beat Brown.” Brown coach Phil Estes has worked the sidelines in 21 editions of this game and appreciates the history as much as anyone. “One hundred years is special. One hundred years of anything is special,” he said. “We’ve won this game four years in a row and I’m not embarrassed to say [the Governor’s Cup] is not going anywhere.” Estes is 9-8 as a head coach against Rhody and 12-9 counting his four years as an assistant under Mark Whipple. For the second straight season, Estes is bringing his team into URI week thirsting for a win. A year ago the Bears had lost at Georgetown and dropped a 22-14 Ivy opener to Harvard. This time around the metrics aren’t as positive. Brown is looking to bounce back from a 20-16 season-opening loss to Bryant and a 53-27 shellacking at Harvard where the doors came off early. A slew of errors including penalties, bad snaps and fumbles have doomed the Bears thus far this season. “For us it’s all mental,” said Estes. “We are making too many mental errors. Just simple things in the heat of a game that cost you. “ After the disheartening loss at Harvard Stadium, Estes said he was thrilled when a block of team leaders came into his office Sunday to talk. “They all said, 'Put me on the kickoff team. Put us on the punt team.’ They were like, 'What are we waiting for? Let’s go,'” Estes said. That energy led to a good week of practice that the coach needed to find out which of his players wanted to compete the hardest. “We’ve addressed a lot of those things and then put our guys in competitive situations in practice this week,” Estes said. “We’ve put our ones versus ones [starters], third-and-ones, pushups for the losers. It was a spirited practice.” Page 2 of 2 - After falling behind, 37-0, at halftime, Brown pulled senior quarterback Marcus Fuller in favor of Kyle Moreno. He responded with 307 yards passing and two TDs passing, and two more rushing. Even so, Estes said Fuller responded well in practice and will start against the Rams. At URI, second-year coach Fleming would love to see his first win over Brown inject some life into his program. The Rams finally see some light at the end of a dark tunnel, most of which is caused by a grizzly schedule. Rhody is playing its fourth road game in five contests. It’s only home game came against a Harvard team that is riding a 17-game winning streak. “I see us progressing, incrementally,” Fleming said. “We improve in some areas and then take a step back in others. We are overall a little bit better each week.” The Rams have struggled to move the ball (230 yards a game) but the return of quick, shifty running back Harold Cooper (out last week with a concussion) and the development of dangerous freshmen receivers Marvin Beauvais (Cranston) and Khari Denny could lend the Rams’ attack the spark it needs. What would a win over Brown do for a team that has home games against Colonial Athletic Association rivals Delaware and Richmond up next? “We look at it that if we can get Brown in our pocket maybe we can generate some confidence and go into the next two weeks with home games. This is a big one,” Fleming said. “If you can circle one that can jump-start our football team it’s a victory on Saturday.” Both Brown and URI will recognize honorary captains who will take the field during the pregame and at halftime. Brown's honorary captains consist of former players and friends of the program selected by a vote of alumni and fans. They include John Berylson, Stephen Campbell, Gov. Donald Carcieri, Richard Carolan, Tom Catena, Paul Choquette, Dennis Coleman, Zak DeOssie, James Develin, Dick Dresdale, Robert Farnham, Robert Flanders, Anthony Gould, Bob Hall, Nick Hartigan, Marquis Jessie, Steve Jordan, Art Joukowsky, Jerry Massa, Sean Morey, Kevin Mundt, Gov. Phil Noel, Gordon Perry, James Perry, George Pyne, Brian Wallace, Mark Whipple and Gus White. URI is honoring its all-time greatest coach in Bob Griffin and the following former players: Mark Cruise, Mark Brockwell, Kurt Brockwell, Tom Cataldo, Charlie Bounty, Tony Lowe, Eric Jenkins, Brian Forster, Barney Rinaldi, Larry McPhillips and Ralph Zednik. -kmcnamar@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:42:50.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
