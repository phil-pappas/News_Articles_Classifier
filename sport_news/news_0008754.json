They came out here and played hard, but hats off to Alcoa.\"\nThe victory was Alcoa's eighth straight in the series, dating back to 1989, and it was due in large part to its rushing attack. The Tornadoes rushed for 243 yards.\n\"I know we had a lot of people touch it and that's who we are right now,\" Alcoa coach Gary Rankin said. \"We're spreading it around pretty good and hopefully we can continue to do that.\"\nOne of those runners wasn't Karim Shereef, who didn't dress for the game because of an injury. Shereef's absence was just precautionary, though. Rankin said he could have played if needed.\nBolden, who rushed for 42 yards on eight carries and completed just one pass for one yard, exited the contest in the second half after he took a hit to the head in the second quarter.\n\"He came to the sideline and I could just tell he was kind of out of it,\" Pankey said. \"So I decided to pull him because he's got some football to play in him and I didn't see the point of putting him back in.\"\nBolden will get an extra week to recover as Kingston has a bye before it travels to Loudon on Oct. 30. Alcoa will travel to play Red Bank on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:18:44.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
