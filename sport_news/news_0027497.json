The chemistry it speaks of is real for the Thunderbirds. And the results — and their actions — keep proving it. \nUp against Paramus Catholic on Wednesday in a non-divisional matchup, Mahwah held off a late rally for a 2-1 mini-upset under the lights behind goals from Nikki Roberts and Nicole Costantino and the fluent, facilitating play of Sarah Jordan. \nBut upon receiving news from coach Courtney Carrelha that the team would get a rare day off today, the Thunderbirds’ mild postgame celebration quickly morphed into an enthusiastic and detailed planning session. \nThe players were excited not because they will have the day off, but rather because they could go see teammate Samantha Ullman — who tore her ACL in the season-opening win over Ramsey — at her house while she recovers after undergoing surgery Wednesday. \nEven on off-days, Mahwah wants to be together. Its bond is noticeably strong. \n“And that’s them,” Carrelha said. “That’s the kind of team they are. They’ve been lights out on the field, but they support each other off it. They care about each other. It’s exciting to see they understand the importance of ‘team.’ ” \nThe Thunderbirds are “compatible,” as star senior sweeper Jen Moutenot — fully recovered from an ACL tear of her own — put it. And it’s evident in the way Mahwah has played, racing out to a 7-2-1 start. \nMoutenot, a dominant and smart shutdown defender, said she feels this T-Birds team is the best one since 2010 — the year Mahwah won the Group 2 state title. \nWednesday’s win was important because of what’s potentially to come. Mahwah, the No. 5 seed in the ongoing Bergen County tournament, could see Paramus Catholic, the fourth seed, in the quarterfinals if both win Sunday. \nCarrelha and PC coach Bill McPartland said there were talks about canceling or postponing Wednesday’s game due to the potential county matchup. But the competition to prepare for Sunday’s round of 16 was too good to pass up. \n“I think we showed our skill tonight,” Roberts said. “It was important to see the competition for when we hopefully take them on later in counties.” \nRoberts, a senior outside midfielder, got the T-Birds off to a good start in the 16th minute. She made a run for a loose ball after Brenna Jaffe’s header rebounded hard off the crossbar. A high-arcing, left-footed shot from close range snuck inside the right post for a goal on a shot Roberts said of: “I didn’t think it was going in at all.” \n“Like I say to the girls all the time: It doesn’t have to pretty, you just have to be hungry inside the 18,” Carrelha said, smiling. “It paid off on that goal.” \nThe hustle paid off again early in the second half when Costantino toe-touched her way through two defenders inside the box off a throw-in, beat the Paladins keeper to the ball and pushed one to the back of the net with 37:32 left. \nThe T-Birds withstood a late Paladins charge orchestrated by Fordham-bound senior Juliana Mascelli, who scored with seven minutes left and nearly tied it up with under two minutes to go on a shot that slid just inches past the right post. \n“I think we needed a game like this,” said Carrelha, whose team is coming off back-to-back 8-0 wins. “We’re happy we played them. Happy to get a win. We tried to pick up a few of these independent games for a reason.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:52:25.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
