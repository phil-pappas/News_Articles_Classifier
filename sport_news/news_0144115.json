The Bobcats suffered a 1-0 defeat. « 3 » \nThe Estes Park High School Bobcat soccer team continues to control its destiny as it remains strong against league competitors. \nThe Sterling Tigers traveled to Estes on Saturday, Oct. 3 for a second duel with the Cats. This time the final score counted toward the teams' league record. Sterling took home the win 1-0. \n\"I don't know how we are getting out of here with the one-point win,\" said the Sterling Coach Ben Hackbarth. \"Estes always brings a tough game.\" \n\"The boys played the second half of the game really tough,\" said Estes Park Coach Kay Hays. \"We had opportunities; the boys are playing hard. I can't ask for anything more than that. Unfortunately we just couldn't finish.\" \nThe Bobcats have a 3-2 record in the 3A Region 4 and a 4-6 overall record. \"We are still in there,\" Hays said. \nThe top two teams in the league get an automatic invite into the state playoffs; 14 wild card teams also advance. \n\"I sure hope they look at us this year, the way these boys are playing they are strong enough to go,\" Hays added. \nTanner Stark continues to show his strength in the midfielder spot. \n\"His strength and leadership are invaluable to our team,\" Hays said. \"He's a beast and unfortunately I can't allow him to come up.\" \n\"Connor Flanery is another one of our 80-minute strong players, who covers the mid-field and also leads this team by example.\" Advertisement \nAs Estes nears the end of its season, \"every game counts from now on.\" \nThe Cats hosted Frontier Academy on Tuesday. \n\"We have something that Frontier Academy struggles with; every time we play them they struggle. We have the home field advantage this time; it'll be cooler, higher altitude, shorter field. We hope to do some damage,\" Hays said. \nEstes will travel to Community Christian on Thursday, Oct. 8 and then conclude its season playing at Roosevelt on Oct. 13 and returns home to host Roosevelt Oct. 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:55:06.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
