That's because its entrance fee is three canned goods. The goal is not only to have a great time but to raise much-needed food for a local charity, Respond Now in Chicago Heights.\n\"We are hoping at least 100 people come out. That is our goal, if not more,\" Watson, a senior at Homewood-Flossmoor High School, said.\nFor the past six weeks, Watson has been planning the event, which will run from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. and start at Apollo Park's entrance,1023 W. 191st St.\nIn the summer, Watson applied for a grant from Youth Services America and found out three weeks ago that she received it. That seed money will be used to hire a face painter for the zombies and treat bags for the participants. The event will also include a bullseye game and a photo prop booth along with the scary trail walk.\n\"Growing up she was so very quiet, very introverted,\" Watson's mother, Tamika Britten, said. \"It was even hard to get her to talk. Now she's working off of spreadsheets, talking in front of crowds and organizing 40 to 50 students. It is just amazing.\"\nWe Day Illinois Cocktail Reception Courtesy of Free the Children Destiny Watson, a senior at Homewood-Flossmoor High School, has gained recognition for her efforts to fight hunger in the south suburbs, including organizing a Halloween-related event Saturday in Homewood.

(Courtesy of Free the Children) Watson's dedication to improving her community also has paid off unexpectedly for her, and in a big way.\nShe was invited to the first-ever WE Day Illinois on April 30 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont hosted by Selena Gomez and featuring performers and celebrities including Jennifer Hudson, Martin Sheen, Common and Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson.\nThe night before the event, Watson was invited to speak at a kick-off dinner for the event, and Magic Johnson was so impressed by her speech that he called her up during his talk and pledged to pay for her entire college education.\n\"I was very surprised I wasn't expecting that at all,\" Watson said.\nWatson's transformation began after she heard a WE Day speaker at a Demi Lovato concert a few years ago. Lovato, her favorite performer, had invited Spencer West, an author and speaker to join her world tour.\n\"He was talking about the trip that he went on in Kenya, and there were a lot of pictures. That is something that I always wanted to do,\" Watson said.\nShe went home, researched the organization, which encourages young people to actively work to better their communities, and decided that she wanted to become more involved in WE Day and the Homewood-Flossmoor community.\nWatson created an Instagram page, You Matter 2, and posted inspirational Quote: s and uplifting sayings. She also sent a tweet, calling on other \"motivated teens who want to change the world,\" she said.\nAs others joined her, Watson organized an event through the Free the Children, the charity that sponsors WE Day. Her group sold 40 rafiki (\"friend\" in Swahili) bracelets at H-F for the charity's anti-hunger campaign.\nIn addition, Watson meets once a month with her group, which has no affiliation with the high school, to plan events and other projects in the community.\n\"She is like the epitome of what we hope to develop in our program,\" said Francie Schnipke Richards, director of the Illinois office of Free the Children in Chicago. \"She is a great example of a young person who has (overcome some challenges) and continues to give back to others.\n\"This is someone who gets started in one thing, finishes one thing and then thinks about the next thing,\" Richards said.\nFor more information about Saturday's event or You Matter 2, go to www.youmatter2.com/\nPatricia Trebe is a freelance reporter.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown High Schools Haunted Houses (attractions)", "external_links": ["http://www.youmatter2.com/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562017f1/turbine/ct-ct-sta-homewood-zombie-trail-eve-jpg-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56201b69/turbine/ct-sta-homewood-zombie-trail-event-st-1016-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:44:06.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
