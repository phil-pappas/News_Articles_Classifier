(AP Photo/Wade Payne) By Marc Weiszer ATHENS — Missouri missed having to face Todd Gurley last season when his suspension came down days before the game.\nThe Tigers this time around won’t see Nick Chubb lined up in the Bulldogs’ backfield after he was lost for the season with a knee injury Saturday against Tennessee.\n“Now they go to the next step,” Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said at a news conference Monday. “They’ve got some other good running backs. They’ve recruited well there.”\nThe next step as the featured back is Sony Michel, who rushed for 145 yards on 22 carries against the Volunteers in the 38-31 loss.\n“Sony Michel is a starting running back on any team in the SEC, and he played like it,” wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell said.\nOf course, Chubb was ahead of Michel for a reason. He rushed for 1,547 yards last season and tied Herschel Walker’s Georgia record streak of 100-yard rushing yard games at 13 before his injury.\n“I’m not going to say they’re not going to miss a beat,” Pinkel said. “They’ve lost a great player, but they’ve got some good people in there.”\nKeith Marshall and Brendan Douglas are next behind Michel.\nJenkins also out\nGeorgia’s only sack against Tennessee came on a blitz from safety Dominick Sanders.\nDefensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt may have to look to bring the pressure against Missouri in more creative ways because top pass rusher Jordan Jenkins will miss Saturday’s game.\nThe senior outside linebacker tried to play through a strained flexor, but he won’t go against the Tigers, according to his father.\nPruitt said that Jenkins had been dealing with the injury prior to the Tennessee game. Jenkins leads the Bulldogs with three sacks, nine quarterback pressures and seven and a half tackles for loss. That leaves more of the onus on edge rushing on Leonard Floyd, Davin Bellamy, Lorenzo Carter and Chuks Amaechi.\nSanders on Monday called his sack “pretty fun. I actually felt like (Leonard) Floyd when I came up. It was a good play.”\nThe sophomore nearly had another sack late in the second quarter but jumped and grazed Josh Dobbs on the helmet instead.\n“I kind of felt like he was going to pump fake me, but I adjusted wrong and jumped up in the air,” he said.\nDavis recognized for big plays\nOne critical drop lingered for Georgia receiver Reggie Davis after Saturday’s loss to Tennessee, but the plays he did make in the game were recognized on Monday.\nDavis was named the SEC special teams player of the week and the junior was also one of two players named to the Paul Hornung Award weekly honor roll. The award goes to the nation’s most versatile player.\nThe Tallahassee, Fla., native returned a punt 70 yards for a touchdown, returned four kickoffs for 73 yards and had three catches for 101 yards including a 48-yard touchdown.\nDavis’ drop came at the Vols’ 5-yard line with 1:58 to go on a deep ball.\n“I think he did a good job of putting it behind him and he made (an 18-yard catch) on that last drive,” quarterback Greyson Lambert said. “He also made a touchdown catch and punt return. He’s a dynamic player for us.”\nThis and that\nChubb, who was lost for the season with a left knee injury against Tennessee that will require surgery, was out of the hospital and at the training room of the Butts-Mehre building on Monday. Tight end Jay Rome said he tried to encourage him. “I prayed with him and prayed for him,” Rome said.\n“We’re definitely a family and we’re going to be there for him.” Offensive guard Greg Pyke spoke to Chubb on the plane ride home from Knoxville and told him to keep his head up. “He’s in good spirits,” Pyke said. “We have some of the best medical staff here so I think he’ll have a speedy recovery. …He’s going to come back even stronger.” …Saturday’s captains: Offensive tackle John Theus, wide receiver Reggie Davis and defensive end Josh Dawson. …The SEC Network’s on air crew for Saturday’s game is Brent Musburger, Jesse Palmer and Maria Taylor.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14804950.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14804950.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:05:47.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
