The NFL acknowledges that one of the game officials should have noticed that 18 seconds were incorrectly run off the clock late in the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh’s 24-20 victory at San Diego .\nLeague spokesman Michael Signora says in a statement emailed Monday that “an error by the clock operator” after a touchback allowed extra time to run off, and “it is the responsibility of the side judge to supervise the timing of the game.”\nThe statement adds: “Had the side judge or any of the other six on-field officials noticed the timing error, they could have corrected it.”\nThe NFL will review the work done by the clock operator and game officials.\nRelated Stories Le'Veon Bell scores on direct snap to give Steelers win Vacchiano: How Giants can be beasts of NFC East Jets Insider: DeSean Jackson could get Darrelle Revis wish Tags: pittsburgh steelers , san diego chargers", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:44:33.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
