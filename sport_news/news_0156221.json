Nunez, running for Plouffe, then raced to third on a single to right by Eddie Rosario before Allen bounced a 2-2 pitch to Hunter in the dirt. Hunter followed with a fly to deep right, bringing in Rosario.\nGlen Perkins (3-5) pitched a perfect eighth, and Kevin Jepsen worked the ninth for his 15th save of the season.\nCUBS 5, REDS 3 Austin Jackson hit a three-run homer, Anthony Rizzo added a run-scoring double, and Chicago kept alive its slim hopes for home-field advantage in the National League wild-card playoff game with a victory in Cincinnati.\nChris Denorfia also drove in a run, and the Cubs overcame two errors to move two games behind idle Pittsburgh in the race to host the playoff game on Wednesday. Both teams have three to play — Chicago in Milwaukee and the Pirates against the Reds in Pittsburgh.\nJoey Votto hit a run-scoring single in the seventh inning, extending his streak of consecutive games in which he has reached base at least once to 47, the longest since Kevin Millar’s 52-game stretch in 2007. Votto’s streak is the second longest in the history of the Reds franchise, behind a 48-game stretch by Pete Rose in 1978.\nORIOLES 6, BLUE JAYS 4 Toronto extended the celebration of its first A.L. East title in 22 years by resting its starters in a rain-delayed defeat at Baltimore.\nManny Machado homered twice for the Orioles, who took a 3-0 lead in the first inning against Drew Hutchison (13-5) before the game was stopped for 3 hours 25 minutes.\nAlthough the Blue Jays are still dueling with Kansas City for the best record in the A.L. — a distinction that will provide home-field advantage through the postseason — Toronto Manager John Gibbons has placed a priority on keeping his players fresh.\nDavid Price, the Blue Jays’ ace, was scratched from his scheduled start. The star sluggers Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion also sat out.\nDODGERS 3, GIANTS 2 Brett Anderson pitched two-hit ball into the eighth inning, and Los Angeles wrapped up its road schedule with a victory in San Francisco.\nAnderson (10-9) retired 14 straight batters after Kevin Frandsen’s one-out single in the third before Jarrett Parker singled to start the eighth.\nJust three balls left the infield against Anderson, and no San Francisco runner reached second base until an error in the eighth inning.\nTim Hudson (8-9) allowed three runs and three hits in two and a third innings in the final start of his 17-year major league career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:00:13.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
