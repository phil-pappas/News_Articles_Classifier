Finally there is a main course for the LSU football team to sink its teeth into.\n After six weeks, five wins and a rollercoaster ride at times, the No. 6/5-ranked Tigers get a much sterner test this week when No. 8/11 Florida rolls into town.\nThe two SEC rivals kick off at 6 p.m. at Tiger Stadium (ESPN) in a battle of, perhaps surprising, division leaders.\nBecause of Leonard Fournette, LSU (5-0, 3-0 SEC) might not be as big a surprise. The Gators (6-0, 4-0), however, have surfaced from off the radar by grinding out close wins over Kentucky (14-9) and Tennessee (28-27) and then impressive lopsided wins over then No. 3 Ole Miss (38-10) and last week at Missouri (21-3).\nSince a furious rally against Tennessee in Knoxville two weeks ago netted a comeback victory, Florida has allowed only one touchdown in the last eight quarters and that came late in the game against a Rebels' team that has looked like an offensive juggernaut the rest of the season.\nWith the stage ready to set the rest of the week, here are the 'Nuts & bolts' about Florida.\n1) Be prepared for a different way\nThe last couple of opponents neutralized the LSU running game and Fournette for long stretches, especially early in the game. Neither Eastern Michigan nor South Carolina have anywhere close to the talent level that the Gators do, and that talent has equated an awfully stingy run defense this season.\nLSU receiver Travin Dural hauled in a 62-yard touchdown pass from Brandon Harris on Saturday against South Carolina. Michael DeMocker, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune Florida comes in ranked second in the SEC in rushing defense -- right between Alabama and LSU -- allowing only 99.2 yards a game and 3.1 per carry. That number grows to 136 per contest against SEC foes, although Missouri managed only 106 on 26 tries.\nLSU showed some versatility against Carolina on Saturday with Brandon Harris launching a career-high 28 passes on the way to a career-best 228 yards. If the Tigers can mix in short passes and execute the play-action game well, Florida has been vulnerable at times to the pass at times and allows 197.2 yards a game, although the Gators have picked off 7 passes.\nFournette will run the ball, and figures to get some change-of-pace help from Derrius Guice and Darrel Williams. But Cam Cameron also needs to be prepared to mix things up early, often and until the LSU line shows it can wear Florida down.\n2) Stay on the field, hold onto the ball\nBesides slowing down the run, the Gators' defense has excelled in two other areas: Taking the ball away and denying third-down conversions.\nFlorida is an SEC-best +8 in turnover margin with 6 fumble recoveries to go with the 7 interceptions. Last week Missouri converted only 1-of-14 third downs, and that in part led to a massive discrepancy in time of possession in the Gators' favor.\nLSU seems equipped to offset both of those strengths. The Tigers have lost the ball only once in five games and Harris has not thrown a pick. On third downs, LSU has been very solid: 19-for-39 (48.7%) in SEC games.\nLSU safety John Battle (26) icame up with his first career interception on a deflected pass Saturday against South Carolina. Michael DeMocker, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune 3) Tighten things up\nAs good as the LSU secondary is based on potential and talent, there have been some glaring concerns, namely breakdowns and tackling issues after the Tigers have built second-half leads. That was the case against South Carolina when every time LSU's offense churned out a drive that had the makings of a backbreaker, the defense gave up and play and/or a drive to let the Gamecocks stay within shouting distance.\nFlorida's offense has not been a strength this season. Facing a stingy Mizzou defense, the Gators scratched and clawed to generate 337 yards and averaged only 5.5 yards per pass play and 2.9 on each rushing attempt.\nNot allowing Florida to get into a rhythm and harassing first-year starting quarterback Will Grier needs to be the focus of a Tigers' defense that stacks up well statistically but has yet to put a 60-minute performance together,\nFirst-year Florida coach Jim McElwain L.G. Patterson | Associated Press Quotable\nFlorida coach\nJim McElwain\n\"Unbelievable road win. People will pick this apart, but I'd rather be bad and get a win than be bad and lose.\"\n\"We didn't play great by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm proud of them.\"\n\"I've got to tell you, I was really proud of (the defense). We didn't play with great energy. Sometimes you've got to win games that way.\"\n\"I don't know where we're at. We'll find out (this) week.\"\nSeries record: Florida leads 31-27-3, although the Tigers have claimed four of the last five meetings and four of six at Tiger Stadium.\nLes Miles vs. Jim McElwain: This is the first time they meet with both as head coaches. When McElwain was the Alabama offensive coordinator at Alabama (2008-11), the Crimson Tide claimed three wins in five games, including the 2012 BCS National Championship Game.\n2015 Florida statistics Florida (6-0, 4-0 SEC) | 2015 schedule\nSept. 5 Florida 61, New Mexico State 13\nSept. 12 Florida 31, East Carolina 24\nSept. 19 Florida 14, Kentucky 9\nSept. 26 Florida 28, Tennessee 27\nOct. 3 Florida 38, Ole Miss 10\nOct. 10 Florida 21, Missouri 3\nOct. 17: at LSU, 6 p.m. (ESPN)\nOct. 31 vs. Georgia (Jacksonville), 2:30 p.m. (CBS)\nNov. 7 Vanderbilt, TBA\nNov. 14 at South Carolina, TBA\nNov. 21 Florida Atlantic, TBA\nNov. 28 Florida State, TBA", "external_links": ["http://www.gatorzone.com/football/stats/game.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-11T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:22:45.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
