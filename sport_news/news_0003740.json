And they have done today - not so much the opponent, but definitely the referee. \n\"I have seen lots of challenges like that in the game, in every game and, outside the box, they are never given. It's a double whammy - a penalty and 10 men. It made it very difficult. \n''We need an experienced referee for this and I think he was a little too quick to make a decision.'' \nSecond half goals from Billy Jones and Fletcher sealed a victory for Sunderland which saw them move above their rivals, although both teams occupy positions in the bottom three above Aston Villa.
