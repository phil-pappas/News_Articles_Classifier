The second nearly got them out of it before they ran out of time. \nThe end result was Parkland losing its first game of the year, 41-34 , to Liberty on a night when it scored 21 unanswered points and had a chance to win in the end. \n“We had good practice all week,” Trojans coach Jim Morgans said. “The kids knew the gravity of this game and that kind of stuff. But once the game started, it didn’t appear that way. I don’t know if there was a disconnect or whatever.” \nRELATED : Liberty football's defense makes just enough big plays to beat Parkland \nThe first Parkland team was the one that had scored just seven points by halftime and went three-and-out three straight times to start the third quarter. \nSenior quarterback Devante Cross started the game 7 of 17 for 26 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions. \nAnd then, once the Hurricanes’ lead got to 34-7, something clicked. \nCross completed his next seven passes in a row for 246 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions as the deficit shrunk to 41-27. In that span, which began after the third consecutive three-and-out to begin the third quarter, the Trojans racked up eight first downs on nine plays – totaling 269 yards. \n“I don’t think they really changed that much,” Morgans said. “We set our pass protection to a different side. If that made a difference, I don’t know. I thought we did well in the second half, but they probably figured, if you get a big lead like that, if you don’t stay involved in the game – which I’m not going to speak for them – but that may have happened. Then you get a couple scores on you and that kind of stuff.” \nOutside of that stretch, Parkland gained 206 yards on 55 plays. \nOne play after the span ended, the Trojans went to a trick play – a halfback pass by Nolan Ridgway – and it backfired as the ball ended up in the hands of Liberty safety Justin Haynes. \nCross finished with what turned out to be a monster game, completing 18 of 32 passes for 317 yards and two touchdowns, adding 18 carries for 48 yards and two more scores. \n“He played an awesome football game,” Morgans said. “It’s what I expect out of him.” \nRidgway caught five passes for 168 yards and a touchdown while adding two rushes for 54 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:24:02.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
