Sainz was later taken to hospital by helicopter but scans showed no injuries. \nThe crash happened at Turn 13 - a tight right hander at the end of a DRS zone. The session was red flagged with 25 minutes still to run while the medical car responded to the incident. \nPictures of the scene showed tyre marks along the barrier on the outside of the track in the braking zone for the corner, suggesting Sainz made contact with the wall before reaching the run-off area. Sainz tweeted from his hospital bed that he is OK. \nWith 15 minutes of final practice remaining it was confirmed that the session will not be restarted, with the drivers climbing out of their cars and awaiting more news. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
