(AP) — Former NBA All-Star Chris Webber has a new job: teacher. \nWake Forest University announced Monday that Webber will teach a course in its new master of arts in sports storytelling program. \nWebber will be a professor of practice in the program that is part of the university’s documentary film program. He will teach a class on sports, race and society. \nWebber was part of Michigan’s “Fab Five” in the early 1990s, made five All-Star teams during his 15-year NBA career and now works as a television analyst. He formed a production company in 2012 with “Hoop Dreams” producer Peter Gilbert — who’s also a professor of practice in the university’s documentary film program. \nThe program launches in Fall 2016.
