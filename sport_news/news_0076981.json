The light of Reno’s early evening softens, goes dream-like, following a hot day. \nTwenty years ago they would gather, like clockwork. Every lunch hour they would run, through Idlewild and the surrounding southwest Reno neighborhoods. \nThe men are in their 50s and 60s. Two are in their early 70s. \nAt first they seem slightly stiff, moving as men who have been athletic most of their lives do – with a mixture of fierce pride and quiet patience. It takes a few minutes, but gradually, inevitably, their movements transform. They become fluid. Their footfalls are light. The swift rush of time stops. The air fills with wisecracks, smiles and laughs. \nThey are all runners. Or, at the very least, still think of themselves as runners. Tonight, all of them – Kent Robison, Don Nomura, Skip Houk, Robert Stuyvesant, Bob Mueller, Rob Pyzel, Joe Plater – are here for Perry. \nPerry Hayden, the glue that kept the group together, has been fighting Stage 4 pancreatic cancer since fall 2014. Perry’s better now. He’s always been a spritely and energetic man – 5-foot-7 and now back to his running weight of 130 pounds after seeing his weight drop to a low of 100 pounds during cancer therapy. He has a CT-Scan coming up soon. \nHe’s hopeful the cancer isn’t advancing. \n“My legs are coming back … they’re getting stronger,” says Hayden, who isn’t back to regular running yet but has been walking daily with another member from the old running group, Peggy Black, and cycling regularly with Pyzel and Stuyvesant. “It’s been a long road. But I’m coming back.” \nThey are gathered tonight to reenact a photograph that appeared in the Reno Gazette-Journal 20 years ago. The group profiled then might’ve been the most notable gathering of local runners of the time, including perhaps the greatest local runner northern Nevada ever produced, Skip Houk. \nBut that wasn’t all. It was a special running group. They were a cohesive mix of personalities and professions, with enviable closeness. \nThey were friends. \nAnd, they were like clockwork. \nEvery week, every year, for more than a decade. It was the same script, the same cast of characters with the same ending: Get the lunchtime run in from the old Reno YMCA on Foster Drive. \nLives have changed since then. The group has quietly dispersed. \nStill, the time evokes a kind of perfect innocence, fondly remembered. \n“We had so much fun together,” says Houk, who ranked among the country’s top 10 marathoners by Track & Field News in the 1970s. “What a group. We had every base covered – defense attorneys, guys in the district attorney’s office, psychologists. You were guaranteed if you ever got into any trouble, there would always be somebody who could bail you out of jail, somebody who could be your attorney, and somebody who could help you with any psychological counseling.” \nHouk pauses for comic effect. He winks, then smiles: “It was great, great fun … such an incredible journey we’d all go on during those noontime runs.” \nSays Hayden: “Each one of us has been through trials and tribulations through the years. But the support, the camaraderie of the group, whether we’re running on not, has always been there whenever we’ve needed it. It’s a great group of friends.” \nEach runner had a distinct role within the group. Hayden was the one who rarely missed a run. \n“The guy loves to run,” says Stuyvesant, a Reno therapist. “No one loves to run more than Perry. He’s just so passionate and positive – always so encouraging. He would always take you under his wing and show you the ropes.” \nKent Robison, an attorney and age group world champion in X-Terra, agrees: “Perry’s always brought a civility and dignity that defies the ferocity with which he competes. He succeeds without ego, prevails without arrogance … he’s undeniably one of the best runners I’ve ever known.” \nAlthough he ran with everyone, Hayden’s most consistent training partner was Pyzel. \nPyzel, a land use planner, stands 6-2 and weighs 165. It takes two or three of Hayden’s short, quick-as-a-blink steps to equal one of Pyzel’s long, loping strides. \n“We’d start a big race,” says Pyzel, remembering the many times the would travel together to the Bay Area and Run, “and Perry would never stop talking, directing me to bob over here, dodge this here, watch out for that fire hydrant there. He was always watching out for me. \n“He would always find the way. He’s always been that way … for all of us.” \nIt came as a shock to all of them when Hayden learned he had pancreatic cancer. \nHayden had gone mountain biking in Moab, Utah, with one of the first young people Hayden had ever hired during his 36-year career as a supervisor in the City of Reno’s Parks and Recreation program, Lyle Freeman, who’s now a retired Douglas High cross country coach. Hayden took a fall on his mountain bike. A handle bar jammed into his side. \n“I felt OK after, but a couple of months later, the pain came back,” Hayden said. “I thought it was a hematoma at first.” \nA CT-scan on Oct. 13, 2014 revealed pancreatic cancer. \n“I started chemo in the middle of November,” Hayden says, crediting his wife, Leath, his daughters, Jackie and Heidi, and his friends for getting him through what he describes as a “painful” process. “I knew I was in bad shape,” he says of the Stage 4 diagnosis. “But halfway through the chemo, my oncologist said, ‘You’re doing great. You’ve led a strong, physical life. That’s helping you right now.’” \n“You’ve got to stay positive,” he adds. “You’ve got to realize that you can’t ever give up.” \nSoon, the group gathers. They stretch across the small service road near the California Building. \nAs they run, the passing of the years fades. Photographer Drew Cortright, an employee at Eclipse Pizza, where Hayden has worked the morning shift for a decade since retiring from the City of Reno, tells the group to “jog slow” for a better photo. “Jog slow?” Hayden calls out, his laugh soaring. “It’s not a problem for this group!” \n“You could hear all the chattering, just like the old days,” Hayden says later. He smiles. His expression grows wistful. “Getting them together brought back a lot of memories. Great memories. I want to get back to running soon. I’d like to get back to it because I miss it … I really do.” \nHe misses it so much, and those who run with him tonight realize how much less meaningful their running would have been if not for him. \nThe lessons they’ve learned from him still ring true. \nIncluding one that seems appropriate now – on this night when they’ve gathered for Perry. \n“Perry knew better than anyone,” Pyzel says, recalling how Hayden’s direction would bathe those crazed, confusing starts of Bay Area races in an immediate calm, with words that were polished with simple, hopeful wisdom. “Perry would always say, ‘Just keep moving … just keep moving … It’ll get better soon.’” 307 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1RSFxa8 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:37:54.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
