(Jeffrey Phelps / AP) Philip Hersh Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune \"You always have to think of what you have to do in case something goes wrong.\"— Evgenia Medvedeva \nEvgenia Medvedeva may not have been able to stay on her feet well enough Saturday to make her long program truly remarkable, but the 15-year-old's ability to think on her feet under pressure still made it good enough to turn her senior Grand Prix debut into a triumph. \nThe two double-toe-loop jumps Medvedeva tacked on late in the program not only helped offset a fall that wiped out a planned three-jump combination but also accounted for nearly all of her Skate America winning margin over Gracie Gold at Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Panther Arena. \n\"You always have to think of what to do in case something goes wrong,\" Medvedeva said. \"You have to be thinking a step ahead. \n\"My coaches and I discuss this. It happens many times, and then you have to change. I know what to do, and I do it.\" \nGold, the leading U.S. woman over the past two seasons, took the free skate with a performance far closer to flawless than anyone else's on a day when nine of the 12 women — and three of the top four — had falls. Her only significant mistake was turning a triple salchow into a double. (Philip Hersh) \n\"The takeoff was a little slippy, and I just didn't commit enough to really get in and try to save it,\" Gold said. \nIn the end, a botched jump in Friday's short program for which she got zero points was what left Gold (202.80) behind Medvedeva (206.01). But the Russian's two added double jumps — one creating a combination, the other a third jump of a combination — were worth 2.86 points of the 3.21-point gap, and if they had impressed the judges enough to push up her grades of execution, that also could have been enough to make the difference. \nThat Medvedeva improvised right after the fall certainly was impressive. \nSatoko Miyahara of Japan, the reigning world silver medalist, was a distant third, with Karen Chen of the U.S. fifth and Yulia Lipnitskaya of Russia sixth. Even avoiding a fall was not much help for Lipnitskaya, who looked profoundly unhappy on and off the ice as she tries to rebuild a career that fell apart the year after she won the2014 European title and dazzled the world at the Olympics. \nChen, 16, the surprise bronze medalist at last season's U.S. Championships, hoped for more in a Grand Prix debut, but she fell twice in the free skate after finishing a solid fourth in the short program. \n\"I wanted the podium,\" she said. \nMedvedeva, the world's dominant junior skater last season, now has topped the podium in her first two senior international events. The first was a lower-level competition three weeks ago in Slovakia, where she also had won the short program and fell before finishing second in the long. \nIn her Saturday long program, skated with a compelling lightness to the soundtrack from the romantic movie \"W.E\" and the Allegro of film composer Rene Aubry, Medvedeva landed seven triple jumps convincingly but fell on a double axel. She said a quad salchow is in her future plans. \nAaron men's champion: Max Aaron got the first Grand Prix victory of his career and became the first U.S. man since Evan Lysacek in 2009 to win Skate America. \nAaron, battling back from two subpar seasons, edged Japan's Shoma Uno, the long program winner, by 1.52 points overall. \nJason Brown's gossamer skating in a long program with a clear sense of emotional unity was undone by his jumping mistakes: fall on an under-rotated quad, downgraded triple axel, under-rotated triple toe. But most of those ahead of him after the short program, when the reigning U.S. champion from Highland Park was eighth, skated so poorly in the long program he moved up to third place, 19 points behind Uno.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:46:04.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
