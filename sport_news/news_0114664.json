On Sunday, the Free Press ran an exclusive excerpt in which Rose described Chris Webber’s infamous time-out by at the end of the 1993 NCAA championship game. (Catch up by reading the excerpt at freep.com/wolverines!)\nToday, the Free Press runs its final excerpt. In the chapter titled “The Revolution,” Rose recounts the Fab Five’s first appearance on the Michigan campus — off and on the court. His story picks up after revealing that Muhammad Ali invited the Fab Five to his Atlanta hotel suite at the start of the NCAA tournament and told the freshmen to “go shock the world.”\nThis is the second of two excerpts. Read the first one here .\n* * * * *\nSix months before meeting Muhammad Ali, I was just heading off to be a star at Michigan. But I felt like Jed Clampett. You know, from “The Beverly Hillbillies.” I was driving my mom’s green Dodge Shadow, which I’d gotten late in 11th grade to replace the Omni she had given me when I got my license. Since my mom worked at Chrysler, we’d gotten both cars on a big discount using the “A-plan” for employees. The car wasn’t too big, and I’d loaded up the back with my stereo components, so for the 30-minute drive west out of Detroit to Ann Arbor, I had to pack it to the brim to get everything I needed for school inside. Like I said, Jed Clampett.\nWhen I got to town, I had no idea where my dorm was and had to call an assistant coach from a pay phone to have him direct me. That’s right, no cell phone! Finally, I pulled up and got out. I heard my name being shouted. I looked, and there they all were — Michigan’s other four star freshman recruits, hanging out of the window, welcoming the fifth and final member of the club.\nIt couldn’t have felt more right.\nI’d obviously known C-Webb for years, and he and I had become friendly with Juwan Howard through camps. We’d met Jimmy King at the McDonald’s All-American Game the spring before and had actually rearranged our dorm assignments with the other guys so all five of us could all be in connecting rooms. I’d never met Ray Jackson before, though — so this was really the first time, in my head and my heart, that the full brotherhood was formed. Instantly. From the get-go, we were all just giddy, joking around like we’d known each other for years, like we were destined to play together. After an hour or so it became apparent hanging out and playing video games wasn’t going to quench the adrenaline that we had going.\nIf you looked out the window of our dorm rooms, you’d notice a full-court basketball court right outside South Quad. And there’s no time like the present, right? So we headed outside and walked onto the court. There were some other kids playing and they were psyched to have us join them, pretty quickly figuring out who we were. At first, we played against them a bit, going easy. Soon, though, it turned into a highlight show. I threw an alley-oop to Chris Webber, and he almost broke the basket dunking it. Jimmy and Ray started taking turns going coast-to-coast. Juwan, throwing bullet outlet passes, and two-handed stuffs. Total Showtime. The other guys who had been playing stood off to the side, egging us on to do more. Pretty soon people were hanging out of windows all over the quad, checking us out, screaming for us, giving us love.\nUnofficially, it was the first day of the Fab Five.\nIt was the first sign that a revolution might be coming.\n(From left) Ray Jackson, Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose and Jimmy King will forever be known as the Fab Five.

Competition is what gets kids into Ivy League schools. Competition encourages excellence. So the idea of us being concerned about what the upperclassmen on the basketball team thought of us when we came on board wasn’t high on our agenda. We didn’t hate them; we didn’t resent them. They were our teammates, and we were looking forward to playing with them. But because of the way we’d been recruited, we saw ourselves as a group. And because of our commitment to one another, we were planning to prove that we were the best players on the team, which we got a chance to do on our very first day of scrimmages.\nIn the fall, before official practices with coaches and drills, the team would do workouts on our own in the gym. When basketball players get a chance to work out on their own, that’s basically an open invitation for pickup games. So on that first day in the gym, with 12 or 13 of us there, the upperclassmen started dividing everyone up into teams. Which is when I spoke up.\n“What about us against you?”\nHuh?\n“Freshmen against all y’all. Our five against your best five.”\nOne, I was thinking that all we wanted to do was play together again, just like we had on that outdoor court in South Quad. Two, because there were more than 10 guys in the gym, I was also concerned not all of us would get picked, and one of us would have to sit out the first run. Three, as far as my own situation went, I knew one thing I loved about playing with our five was that I was the point guard. In high school, Howard Eisley had run our offense. Here, with my new teammates, I could be like two of my idols — Magic Johnson and Steve Smith — big at the point, running the show. And last, most important, I was thinking, Well, yeah, this is a pretty quick and straightforward way to prove how good we are together.\nMaybe a little reluctantly, the sophomores, juniors and seniors agreed. But, hey, this was also a chance for them to put us right in our place. Five games later — after who knows how many alley-oops, fast-break dunks, threes drilled from way out; you name it, we hit it — I’m not sure they were thrilled with their choice. Because we dominated them. We won every game.\nAnd, yes, we were going crazy the whole way, screaming at each other, talking trash, pumping ourselves up with every basket and great play. But, ultimately, regardless of all that, the upperclassmen had no choice but to accept the result. Because that’s what competition forces you to do. Once real practices started, and the coaches started dividing us up in different ways, competition revealed the same fact again and again. The freshmen were the ones distinguishing themselves as the best players on the team.\nThat left the coaches with a decision to make.\nThis excerpt from “Got to Give the People What They Want: True
