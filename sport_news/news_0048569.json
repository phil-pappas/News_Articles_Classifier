Umberger and Matt Read.\nHeck, Laughton, 21, wasn't a surefire Flyer until almost the eve of when the 23-man roster was due at the end of camp.\nSo before Thursday's opener in Tampa, Fla., a 3-2 overtime loss to the Lightning, the trio didn't see much - if any - game action together before the puck dropped at Amalie Arena.\nDespite that, the three played arguably the best of the four Flyers forward lines. With the speedy Laughton at center, the line was strong on the forecheck and played a good, two-way game while being matched up mostly against Tampa Bay's powerful second line of Tyler Johnson, Nikita Kucherov and Ondrej Palat. They also played occasionally against superstar Steven Stamkos' line.\nMore coverage VOTE: Will the Flyers make the playoffs? Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone! Buy Flyers jerseys and other gear Forum: Did Flyers make right moves in offseason? Latest hockey odds The checking-line center role Laughton has assumed was one largely played in the past by Sean Couturier, who is now the second-line center.\nIt's an interesting line combination, which, if it's effective, could pay dividends for the Flyers.\nBoth Umberger, 33, and Read, 29, are coming off down seasons, and say they're back to full health. Laughton made the team after a strong camp that displayed his improved two-way game.\nThey started the season off fast, scoring the team's first goal on a play during which all three touched the puck in a matter of seconds before Read found the back of the net. But their stamp on the game came from their ability to keep Johnson's line off the board.\n\"It was kind of our defensive play that was keeping us involved,\" Umberger said after practice yesterday. \"If our line plays responsible, two-way hockey like that, that'll be really good for us.\n\"Our line's gotta keep it simple all the time. That's what our line is going to be about.\"\nUmberger and Read both have some shown a scoring touch in the past, despite unproductive seasons last year. So while the focus might start on the defensive end, there's certainly a capability to put the puck in the net.\n\"It's always what kind of M.O. are you going to have as a line,\" coach Dave Hakstol said. \"They scored a big goal for us, but they also, I thought, gave us a lot of real good five-on-five shifts. A good shift doesn't necessarily mean a shift that ends up in a Grade A opportunity. They ground it out well in the offensive zone. I thought they did a good job of taking care of pucks, with a real mentality coming through the neutral zone, and that gave them a good chance to be able to spend a lot of time in the offensive zone.\"\nLaughton, whom Umberger called \"hungrier and more determined\" this season, isn't focusing on whether his youthful exuberance helps his two veteran linemates in any way. He has the same day-to-day approach his coach and teammates seem to all have.\n\"I just try and bring speed through the middle,\" Laughton said. \"That goal that 'Reader' scored, I thought everyone did a pretty good job getting on pucks and just creating turnovers. That's what we need to do is create turnovers. I think we've got to move past last night's game and look forward to tomorrow and getting a game like that again.\"\nSlap shots Here are some of coach Dave Hakstol's thoughts on tonight's game against the Florida Panthers: \"I think they're a extremely hardworking team. They've got some big bodies both up front and on the back end. They play very hard and they're a young team that obviously grew up quite a bit last year\" . . . It is the season opener for the Panthers, who finished last season with 91 points . . . The Flyers are expected to roll out the same lineup they did Thursday night in Tampa.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNHL_Philadelphia_Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:14:38.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
