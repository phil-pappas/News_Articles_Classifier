Picture: Phil Hillyard Source: News Corp Australia\nFew, if any, sporting leagues around the world can boast a 23 per cent rise in crowds in one year when television coverage and technology have made couch-viewing better than ever.\nBut that’s the growth the Big Bash has recorded from 2013 to 2014, and tickets are selling fast to the opening game.\nSydney Sixers general manager Dom Remond said it was “hugely disappointing” to have to turn away 2000 spectators at the SCG last season when his side hosted the Thunder after tickets sold out early.\n“We are in the Sydney market and people do tend to leave things til the last minute, but our message is certainly to get in early because we don’t want a repeat of last season,” Remond said.\n“I think this year’s Big Bash has got a better quality of player than it ever has, with Chris Gayle coming back and Kumar Sangakkara, we’ve got Michael Lumb and Johan Botha.”\nAnd to appease young families, the Sixers will play a twilight match in their opening home game against Hobart on December 20, played from 4.30-7.30pm and to be followed by Christmas carols on the SCG pitch for fans afterwards.\n Watto shocked by Big Bash boom", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/10/18/DVU_181015_CRI_MADDINSON_INNINGS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/19/1227574/789812-fe5daca2-7615-11e5-9c0a-ce1ed3f9b0e3.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/shane-watson-blown-away-by-rise-of-big-bash-twenty20-league/story-fni2fnmo-1227574789839"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:37:54.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
