Alex MacLean / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Suzie Gerlitz didn’t know what a bark beetle was when she and her husband, Brandon, moved into their dream home in Leisure Pines this past February. The stay-at-home mom, 29, has since become well acquainted with the wood-dwelling pests that have killed nearly every drought-stressed pine on her quarter-acre property. “It’s our first time buying a home, and we thought we were so lucky,” she said. “A few months later, everything was dead.” Hundreds of trees in the subdivision about three miles east of Twain Harte are dead or dying due to bark beetle infestation, another sign of the cascading impacts from the state’s four-year drought. Huge piles of downed logs litter many properties throughout the neighborhood like remnants of a catastrophic windstorm. The once peaceful quiet has been replaced by the constant roar of chainsaws and thunderous cracking of trees being felled. Tuolumne County leaders and tree experts say the problem has turned into an all-out disaster for communities from throughout the county, calling upon Gov. Jerry Brown to provide emergency funding and resources to help homeowners and avert a major wildfire. Gerlitz and other Leisure Pines residents are wondering how far the problem will spread before the state finally decides to take action. “Are we going to lose every pine on the Highway 108 corridor before someone goes, ‘Oh, I guess we should have done something sooner,’” she asked. Growing crisis More than 13 million trees are believed to be dead in the central and southern Sierra Nevada from one of California’s worst droughts in recorded history, according to recently conducted aerial surveys by Cal Fire and the U.S. Forest Service. Gerlitz first heard about bark beetles in late-May from a neighbor who pointed out the signs of infestation in a 150-foot tall sugar pine that once stood a few feet from her home. A lack of water makes trees — especially pines, oaks and manzanita — more susceptible to the beetles, which bore through bark and feed off their weakened hosts. Gerlitz said arborists have told her the lack of forest thinning is another factor contributing to the speed of the outbreak. Signs can include white spotting on the tree trunks where the beetles have burrowed. Gerlitz said she’s found it’s too late once the tree begins to seep brown, bubbly sap. “I’m a stay-at-home mom and have literally watched these die in front of my eyes,” she said, while looking out from her deck at the numerous piles of bark-stripped logs she has stacked around her yard. Gerlitz and her husband married about seven years ago. The couple lived around Calaveras County before moving briefly to Oakdale last year while looking for their first home. The couple selected the two-story house in Leisure Pines because they thought the area would be a better place than the valley to raise their children, Vance, 6, and Asoph, 2. “We saved for over two years to make sure we could make a down payment and comfortably move into a home,” she said. Gerlitz’s husband works in construction and they put away money each year to carry themselves through winter when his jobs typically slow down. The couple spent $800 earlier this summer spraying their trees with pesticides in hopes of killing the beetles, but it didn’t work. Subcontractors for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. have since cut down eight large pine trees on her property threatening nearby power lines. She and her husband have cut up the logs and stripped them of their bark to prevent the further spread of the beetle. “Fortunately, we’ll be able to use it all over the years, but this is more than we can cut up and strip and stack by ourselves,” she said, pointing to the numerous fallen trees throughout her and her neighbors’ parcels. Gerlitz said she’s counted another 15 trees that are now dead on her property since the last PG&E inspection, and she recently received her second warning from Cal Fire to have them removed. The cost to have them taken down by a private company would be between $1,500 and $2,000 per tree. That is, if the company even has time to do it with the rest of their workload, she said. Gerlitz was recently told by a PG&E utility forester in a phone message that the company wouldn’t be able to have inspectors out to her property again until Nov. 15. She said that means the subcontractors won’t be able to fell the trees until about four to six weeks later. “We can’t wait until this winter,” she said, adding that a snow load or heavy wind would easily topple the weakened trees. Fire risk Another concern is the possibility of a lightning strike or a tree falling into power lines sparking a blaze that many fear would be as destructive as the recent Butte Fire. A tree falling onto PG&E power lines is being investigated as the cause of the fire that destroyed nearly 500 homes and left two dead in Calaveras County last month. “We already have one travesty, and that’s losing the trees,” said Don Britton, who lives part-time in Leisure Pines with his wife, Stephanie. “The next travesty is losing all of these homes.” “If there was an earthquake or something, FEMA would come in and help people rebuild,” he added. “Why don’t we spend a little less money getting rid of the trees before they have to come in and say, ‘Alright, so how do we rebuild all of these houses in this community that was once called Leisure Pines?’” Scott Nye, of Twain Harte Tree Service, was felling trees in the subdivision Monday. He and his four-man crew have been working 10- to 12- hour shifts, six days a week, because of the demand in recent months. Nye, who has worked as a tree contractor since 1981, said the situation is “three to four times” worse than the last major bark beetle outbreak during a drought in the late 80s and early 90s. Another issue is that the local sawmills are so overloaded with wood that they are no longer accepting logs from Nye’s company, which he said has cut into about 10 percent of his income. Nye, too, believes funding from the state is needed to help homeowners, as some jobs can cost more than $10,000 depending on the number of trees. He also warned that even a strong El Niño is unlikely to snuff out the beetle problem. “This coming year’s water is not enough to bring the trees back,” he said. “If the beetle’s there, then they’re dead.” Calls for action The Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency on Sept. 15, in response to the pervasive tree mortality throughout the region. In a letter sent to the Governor’s Office last week, the board urged Brown to do the same. Among the concerns cited in the letter were the dead trees creating fuel for a potentially catastrophic wildfire, falling into homes or disrupting essential services by damaging critical infrastructure, such as roads, power lines and water conveyance systems. According to Tuolumne Utilities District, more than 400 trees have died along the TUD ditch system that provides water to roughly 44,000 county residents. There’s another 167 dead trees near water treatment plants and storage tanks, with the district having already removed 109 at a cost of more than $10,000. Supervisor Evan Royce, whose district includes Leisure Pines and other communities along Highway 108 east of Soulsbyville, said the board is doing everything in its power to get the attention of state officials. “There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind both our board and our staff are aware of the problem and the threat it poses,” he said. However, emergency officials have been tied up responding to both the Butte and Valley fires, the latter of which destroyed over 1,200 homes and killed four people. Royce said he believes it’s only a matter of time before the state responds to the tree morality issue, which has grown beyond the scope of what the county can handle by itself. He urged residents to write letters and send pictures to the Governor’s Office to bring more attention and awareness to the issue. “We don’t have endless resources and bank accounts sitting there where we can write checks from,” he said. “This is an emergency situation that’s above and beyond what we can provide.” On Monday, The Union Democrat asked the Governor’s Office if it had received the board’s letter and whether any plans were in motion to provide assistance to homeowners. “We haven’t received a letter, but will take a careful look when it arrives. Meanwhile, CalFIRE will be in touch to provide more information about this statewide issue, and its severity,” said spokesman Gareth Lacy in a brief response via email. Gerlitz said she plans to continue pushing for action within the community as well. “There’s nothing that one individual person or one group can do,” she said, “but if we all worked together, we could save this area from an epic fire.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:12:24.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
