It would’ve been better than what the Red Sox have gotten at the hot corner since Kevin Youkilis left in 2011. And it’s what the Red Sox were willing to pay Sandoval $17 million per season to do.\nThey must’ve known they were overpaying when they announced the signing of Sandoval to a $95 million deal three days before Thanksgiving last year. But there was a shortage of hitters on the free agent market. Overpaying was to be expected.\nTeams had been struggling to field quality third basemen and when the Red Sox called the Oakland A’s to check on the availability of All-Star Josh Donaldson, they were told to hang up the phone. Options were thin. So they sprung for Sandoval, knowing his .759 OPS over his previous three seasons ranked him 97th among qualified major leaguers, just ahead of Angel Pagan, while his 42 home runs since 2012 placed him outside the top 100.\nThe Sox weren’t asking Sandoval to be the player he was in his early 20s.\n“Just look at who he is now,” then-general manager Ben Cherington said the day Sandoval was introduced. “He’s a player in the prime of his career who’s able to play a tough position at a high level.”\nThey underestimated how quickly Sandoval would decline. How could anyone predict that at 28 years old he’d post the worst season of his career? He was slow at third base. His right-handed swing was so bad (2-for-41) he abandoned it for the first time in his career and became strictly a left-handed hitter (though he plans on returning to switch-hitting next year).\nThe only part of Sandoval’s game the Red Sox accurately predicted was his offensive production at Fenway Park. They hoped his opposite-field swing would work well with the Green Monster, and it did. He collected 21 of his 35 extra-base hits at home, where he hit .288 with a .758 OPS. Away from the comfy confines of Fenway, he hit just .208 with a .563 OPS.\nAt first base, the Red Sox were fielding another player having his career-worst season. Every day, Mike Napoli woke up hoping it would be the last day of his slump. Every day, he was just missing his pitch. Soon he became a gaping hole in the five-spot in the order. He tried to help the team in other ways, taking the extra base when he could or making a fine defensive play, but even his glove work started to go sour.\nWhat went wrong\nBy May, Napoli was hitting .162 with a .519 OPS and just one home run. But Red Sox manager John Farrell had seen this before. Napoli had been in worse slumps and come out of them on fire.\nBy June, Napoli was hitting .208 with a .725 OPS. Better, but still not good enough.\nFarrell, Cherington and the Red Sox decision-makers chose not to make a change. Their patience was costly.\nBy the All-Star break, Napoli was hitting .193 with a .648 OPS. Farrell benched him for a few games and tried David Ortiz at first base, but that wasn’t the solution and Napoli was eventually traded to Texas.\nHe finished the year worth 0.2 WAR while Sandoval was worth negative-2.0 WAR.\nWhat went right\nBrock Holt made the All-Star team with a .292 average and .791 OPS in the first half. Xander Bogaerts might’ve joined him, too, but he was just getting hot when the rosters were announced on July 6. He had two hits and three RBI the next day, then hit .337 with a .797 OPS the rest of the season while providing above-average defense at shortstop.\nHis double play partner, Dustin Pedroia, was having the bounceback season he predicted (.306 average, .819 OPS through 69 games) until he strained his hamstring rounding first base on a routine single on June 24.\nHe played in just 24 of the team’s final 87 games, hitting .250 with a .734 OPS in those contests.\nWhat to do\nThe Red Sox know Pedroia is still an elite second baseman when healthy. But they have to expect he’ll only play 100-120 games each season. Anything more is a bonus. And it’s why Holt is one of the most important players on the roster until the team feels like 20-year-old infielder Yoan Moncada is close to being major league ready.\nAt third, the Sox are committed to Sandoval, with Holt and Shaw as serviceable backups, but 18-year-old Rafael Devers is far from being polished, so help is far away.\nHanley Ramirez will attempt to play first base next year, if the Sox keep him on the roster. That seems unlikely.\nMaybe Shaw can handle the position. Catcher Blake Swihart is certainly capable of playing there. They might have to get creative, because the Sox must get more from the corners in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:25:31.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
