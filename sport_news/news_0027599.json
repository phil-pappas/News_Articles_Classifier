It’s never a good feeling. But I’m pleased that I’m still playing good tennis. I have a lot of work to do though,” the former world No.2 said. \nUnpredictable Latvian Ernests Gulbis out-aced John Isner 23 to 16 in a 6-4 4-6 6-4 knockout of the American third seed to reach the quarter-finals. \nThe defeat meant that Isner’s already slim chances of qualifying for the eight-man field in London took a major hit as the provisional 12th-placed candidate was beaten. \nGulbis went up an early break in the final set and held the edge until the end. \nIn a first-round match, Italy’s eighth seed Fabio Fognini defeated Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-4 3-6 6-3 in the pair’s first meeting since 2009.
