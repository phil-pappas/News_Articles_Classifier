Thieves are using stolen debit cards at Walmarts charging small amounts at a time where they're not being asked to enter a PIN. \nStolen debit card numbers are increasingly being used for purchases of $50 or less, mostly at Walmart stores. Most retailers don't require signatures on purchases that small and scammers don't have to enter a personal identification number tied to the card. \n\"But they're just using such small transactions on these that it's really hard to identify--so what these scammers are doing is using these products for their own consumption or selling them because it's 100 percent profit for them and then they dump the card,\" Jessie Schmidt with Better Business Bureau said. \nThe fraud cases have been steadily growing all summer and into the fall, prompting credit union after credit union around the country to start denying any transaction that doesn't include a PIN. \n\"Clearly this is a target to debit cards and when people run their debit card through, they think they need to push the debit button when they ask if it's credit or debit, but you always want to push the credit button,\" Schmidt said. \nThat's because you'll benefit from fraud protection from your bank and the card issuer, whether it's MasterCard or Visa. With some banks, you can be on the hook for more money when it comes to stolen debit card purchases. If you don't catch the fraud within 60 days and notify the bank, your liability could go up from $50 to $500. After that, you could be out the entire amount. \n\"If a person doesn't review their debit card checking account, only every month when they reconcile their statement, this card is going to be long used and long gone before you would ever notice it,\" Schmidt said. \nThe new cards with computer chips in them are supposed to help fight fraud, but it could be a long time before the system is fully implemented and all debit cards have a chip. \nWalmart says it doesn't require a PIN for purchases under $50 for customer convenience. However, you can ask your bank that a PIN be required for every purchase with your card. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
