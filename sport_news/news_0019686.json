Simon, who signed a negotiated settlement between the city and Justice Department in August 2014.\nThe court's involvement stems from a 2012 federal investigation that found Portland police engaged in a pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness. The settlement calls for a wide range of remedies, including updates to police use-of-force and Taser policies and the dispatch of specially trained officers to mental crisis calls.\nThe agenda for Wednesday afternoon's hearing in U.S. District Court Judge Michael H. Simon's courtroom in Portland. Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLive Justice officials, in a report last month, identified significant problems: police not keeping track of data on use of force, supervisors failing to write reviews of high-profile police shootings, delays in ordering officers involved in shootings not to share information with other officers and an unjustified hesitancy to send out its crisis intervention officers.\nSeparately, the city-hired compliance team found the bureau's use-of-force policy confusing and urged the city to abolish its 48-hour rule that allows officers involved in shootings to wait two days before they're interviewed.\nThe team -- made up of Chicago-based academics Dennis Rosenbaum and Amy Watson -- also urged the bureau to have enough crisis intervention officers working on each shift in each precinct to respond to all mental health-related calls. They also asked the bureau to survey people who have had contact with officers on such calls to measure improvements.\nThe Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice and Police Reform submitted its own report , questioning why no officer involved in the arrest of teenager Thai Gurule was disciplined. Police used a Taser on Gurule and arrested him, but a judge later acquitted him of all charges, including resisting arrest.\nThe coalition urged more community participation in police training on mental health issues and said it opposed any attempts to weaken the settlement agreement.\nThe judge will give an introduction. Justice Department officials will have 35 minutes to speak and answer court questions and city representatives will have the same time. After a 10-minute break, the Albina Ministerial Alliance, Portland Police Association, the city â€“hired compliance team, and Community Oversight Advisory Board will each have 20 minutes to speak.\nCheck the comments section below for updates from the courtroom .\n -- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:09:37.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
