Godfrey said Trosclair was in a Lafayette hospital on Friday night while dealing with medical issues. \n“They told us about it (on Thursday) and we just came out and played this game for (Trosclair),” said Godfrey. \nThe Eunice win elevated the Bobcats to 7-1 overall and 3-0 in 5-3A. Church Point dropped to 6-2 and 2-1. \nBobcats’ assistant Andre Vige was Eunice’s acting head coach. \nLike Godfrey, Vige said the mindset on the Eunice sideline was all about Trosclair. \n“This team was so focused (Friday night). The team dedicated this game to (Trosclair). They did it for him,”Vige said. \nGodfrey’s first touchdown throw was a 56-yard completion to wide receiver Terryl Poullard. The completion gave the Bobcats an 11-point lead. \nThen just over seven minutes later, Godfrey again took another pitch from quarterback Alex Richard and pulled up and threw a 24-yarder to DeShawn Vigers for another TD. \n“On the first one I saw that the cornerback bit when I got the ball. On the second one it was a pass to my cousin (Vigers). He got behind the coverage. Nothing but exciting,” said Godfrey. \nAlthough Godfrey is usually catching passes instead of throwing them, Vige said Godfrey is a weapon passing the ball. \n“(Godfrey) can throw it about 60 yards if he has to . We were confident he could do it,” Vige said. \nChurch Point head coach J.C. Arceneaux said Eunice controlled the line of scrimmage most of the night. \n“We got beat up front. They played better along the line than our kids,” Arceneaux said. \nEunice ran for 279 yards. Godfrey completed two of Eunice’s three passes. \nThe Bears opened the game with a 72-yard, 14-play scoring drive that took seven minutes and three seconds. CPHS ended the march on a four-yard Kylance Castille run. \nEunice followed that with its own scoring drive on the following offensive series. \nThe Bobcats moved 63-yards in 10 plays and scored on Nick Powell’s 14-yard run. The TD was Powell’s eighth in three district games. \nVige felt the Bobcats regained some momentum after responding to the Bears’ only score of the game. \nArceneaux however, felt that a more significant momentum switch occurred when the Bears mishandled the kickoff that was recovered by Lester Martinez at the Church Point 28. \nEunice got a 25-yard field goal off the turnover from Wes Hebert to end the possession (9:22). \nThe 10-7 lead lasted until the Bobcats’ first possession of the second half when Godfrey completed the first of his two TD throws. \nArceneaux said he was aware of what Eunice was trying to do on the play before the ball was snapped, but his players never responded to the coaches’ warnings. \n“We knew about the double pass and we had talked to our kids about it all week. When Eunice lined up for the snap, we were yelling to our kids, but they just didn’t execute,” Arceneaux said. \nThe Bears lost two fumbles and quarterback Troy Matte was sacked one and threw an interception . Matte also completed six of 13 passes. \nDual threat running back Frederick Williams collected only 40 yards on 10 carries, but Arceneaux said Eunice had something to do with that. \nHebert carried eight times for 85 yards and Powell rushed for 47 on 14 carries. \nNEXT WEEK: Church Point goes to Northwest. Eunice is at home against Port Barre.
