Pena won a pair of rounds from the judges and benefited from a point deduction against Eye in the second round for an illegal knee. \nThe point deduction was a questionable one. Eye threw a knee from her back with Pena on top in side control. The knee landed to Pena’s head while she had her own knees on the ground, making it illegal. But in most similar instances in MMA, a warning would be given to the fighter. \nBut when Pena was given a chance after the fight to be critical of either the knee Eye threw, or referee Frank Colazo’s decision to take a point from her opponent, she chose to take the high road. \n“Jessica Eye is very respectful and skilled opponent,” Pena said. “I’m happy I got the win tonight. I don’t make the rules, but I know (the knee) was illegal, and it dazed me a bit. It was down to who had more heart, and that was me.” \nPena and Eye traded punches right out of the gate. When Pena slipped throwing one, Eye couldn’t take quick enough advantage on the ground. But 25 seconds into the fight, they clinched up and soon hit the canvas, a pattern that repeated itself throughout the fight. \nThe first round had swings of momentum, but Pena finished the round in the best position, working elbows to the head from side control. \nIn the second round, Eye worked from the top. When Pena tried to work her way back to her feet, she was caught in an arm-triangle choke and had to struggle out. She worked through Eye trying to tie her arm up shortly after that before moving to the top in side control – when Eye had the illegal knee. \nThe third saw Pena working from the top for most of the round, with a triangle choke threatening her at one point. But Pena worked for a rear-naked choke and finished the round strongly in top position. \nPena won three fights on Season 18 of “The Ultimate Fighter” that don’t count toward her record. But she said she considers herself 6-0 in the UFC, same as unbeaten champion Rousey. \n“I’m 6-0 in the octagon, and so is Ronda Rousey,” Pena said. “(UFC President) Dana White keeps calling her Mike Tyson. Well, I’m Evander Holyfield. \n“Hopefully, we’ll be talking about a title shot here in the near future or I’m in the wrong business. I was disappointed I couldn’t finish the rear-naked choke, but I’m happy with the win.” \nIn the main event, Daniel Cormier outpointed Alexander Gustafsson in a split decision to retain the light heavyweight championship. \nTwo judges gave the fight to Cormier (17-1) with 49-46 and 48-47 scores, and the third had it 48-47 for Gustafsson (16-4).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T12:40:52.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
