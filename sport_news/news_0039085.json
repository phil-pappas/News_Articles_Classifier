Taylor Slack , who is one of our seniors, said in the kickoff event that we have every year, the expectations this year are the same as they've always been. They are to go as far as we can and get to every single postseason game that we possibly can get to. And that's the kind of heart that has brought our team back to this place again.\" \nThe fourth-seeded Tigers will go for another Colonial League title on Thursday night at Northern Lehigh High School when they take on Southern Lehigh. \nSenior defender Haley Hebelka gave Northwestern a 1-0 lead over Saucon Valley when she scored off a corner kick with 1:25 left in the first half. \nIt was enough for Hebelka, her fellow defenders and sophomore goalkeeper McKenna Amey , who made three saves to secure the shutout and punch another ticket for the Tigers in the Colonial League championship game. \n\"We just played our hearts out,\" Amey said. \"We really believed that we could win and we came out there and we won.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:02:40.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
