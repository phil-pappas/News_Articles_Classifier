The Cougars will have home-field advantage for next week's quarterfinal round and, if they win, a semifinal game the following week. \nBaumholder ends its season on a 12-game losing streak dating back to 2013. \nJairiq Leary rushed for 75 yards and a score and Tyler Benton collected 53 rushing yards and a touchdown to pace the Ansbach offense. Dahomey Iglesias had five tackles and a fumble recovery for the Cougars. \nSolo Turgeon gathered 86 yards on seven rushes for Baumholder, while senior Anthony Amos capped his Bucs career with six solo tackles.
