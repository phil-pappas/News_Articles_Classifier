Ben Roethlisberger looked like he was going to be gone for a long while by the way his knee bent a few weeks ago. Turns out it was just an MCL sprain—and that's \"just\" in relation to what couldn't been an ACL tear.\nThat said, it's hard not to cringe at the way Jamaal Charles , the Chiefs ' main weapon, tweaked his knee against the Bears. Note how the below injury comes from how he planted his foot rather than a tackle. Also note how much pain he's in as he's helped off the field.\nJamal Charles is out for life https://t.co/XPdykQCTgz\n— Nick Amato™ (@_tamato_) October 11, 2015 We'll update you on the diagnosis.\n[ via Nick Amato ]", "external_links": ["https://t.co/XPdykQCTgz", "https://twitter.com/_tamato_/status/653283896361123840", "https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/653306817972322304"], "published": "2015-10-11T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:31:40.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
