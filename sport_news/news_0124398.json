The process is the norm for the receiver-rich Packers. \n\"It starts in the meeting room and then it's taken out to the practice field,\" quarterbacks and receivers coach Alex Van Pelt said. \"You have to run the right routes and do all the little things you need to do to win on Sunday. \n\"Aaron has to come to trust you, and then he'll throw the ball to you more often. And when you get to Sundays he may feel more confident throwing it in your direction. But it all starts there (in meetings and practice).\" \nMontgomery hasn't had a breakthrough game yet, but he's following a path similar to the one Adams took last year. He flashed potential in Week 2 against Seattle (four catches for 37 yards), the same as Adams did in Week 2 against the New York Jets (five for 50). \nIn Week 3, Montgomery moved into a full-time No. 3 spot because Adams suffered a sprained ankle, the same way Adams moved up in Week 4 last year because Jarrett Boykin suffered a groin injury. \nMontgomery even had a confidence-shrinking drop Sunday against San Francisco that could have earned him the same sort of public shaming Adams received in Week 3 last year against Detroit when he missed Rodgers' hand signal. Luckily for Montgomery, Rodgers feels more strongly about mental errors than physical ones and took it easy on the rookie. \nIt was Week 5 that Adams caught his first touchdown pass from Rodgers and Week 6 that Rodgers trusted him enough to pull off a fake spike against Miami that set up the winning touchdown in the final seconds. After that, he was off and running. \nMontgomery has played 138 snaps the last two weeks and was targeted six times against the 49ers as well as being handed the ball twice as a running back. With Adams expected to miss a second straight game and Jones on the injury report with a slight hamstring injury, Montgomery may be approaching breakout territory. \nHe has been targeted 12 times this season and has nine catches for 66 yards and a touchdown to go along with two carries for 10 yards. The coaches don't want to overload him, but the time has come for him to take the next step. \n\"He's an extremely versatile kid, very smart,\" offensive coordinator Edgar Bennett said. \"Now he's in that process of earning Aaron's trust, and that's a big part of it. Now, it's making the most of the opportunities in game situations. \n\"He's certainly coming on and he's gaining confidence. He'll continue to improve.\" \nWaiting for their opportunities behind Montgomery are Janis and Abbrederis. \nThey face an impediment inherent in the no-huddle offense, which is that the object is to substitute as seldom as possible and keep the same defense on the field for an entire drive. \nThus, the same receivers play most of the game. It's a major reason Jones has played 90% of the snaps this season, Cobb has played 89.6% and Montgomery 92.6% the last two games. \nActive for all four games this season, Janis has taken 31 of his 32 snaps over the last two games. During that span, Rodgers has thrown him the ball just once, a deep route early in the Kansas City game that he didn't run well. \nJanis earned the snaps because Adams has been hurt, his play in practice has gotten better and his play on special teams has improved every week. The Packers need a deep threat, but if Rodgers isn't willing to throw it to Janis, he might as well not be on the field. \n\"He's improving,\" Van Pelt said. \"There's still room for growth. He's had a few good weeks of practice in a row, and you've seen him get some play time.\" \nThough Janis is behind Jones, Cobb and Montgomery, Bennett and Van Pelt make sure he gets reps with the No. 1 offense in practice. When Janis runs routes for the scout team, he is expected to use the same techniques to get open he would were he running Packers routes. \nAsked what he needs to see from Janis in practice, Van Pelt said, no drops, good processing of the offense, proper conversion of routes and finishing plays. \nSo far, when Janis has been in the game, he mostly has run decoy routes or blocked. Rodgers might not be staring him down in games, but he is when he watches tape the next day, \"absolutely,\" Van Pelt said. It gives him an idea whether he can trust that Janis will be in the right place if he does look that way. \nAbbrederis is a prime example of how Packers coaches reward players for their practice performance. Released on the final cut, Abbrederis returned to the practice squad and in the first three weeks of the season began to show some of the skills that motivated the Packers to draft him in the fifth round in 2014. \nAbbrederis had some catching up to do because he missed all of last season with a torn knee ligament and all but a few days of this year's camp with a concussion. But with Adams ailing, Abbrederis was elevated to the 53-man roster Saturday. \nAbbrederis did not play a single snap against the 49ers, but Bennett said Monday he would get his chance soon. Van Pelt said in just three weeks, Abbrederis has caught the eye of Rodgers and been on the receiving end of an increasing number of passes in practice. \n\"He's quick,\" Van Pelt said. \"He's got really good feet. He knows when to make his breaks. He bends well. He's quick in and out of his cuts, and his hands are strong. He and Aaron have a good rapport.\" \nBut like Janis, Abbrederis needs a chance. If he gets one, he has to do something to force the coaches to keep him on the field. Montgomery is in that situation now, but if he doesn't produce, the next guy will get his chance. \n\"The bottom line is results,\" Bennett said. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
