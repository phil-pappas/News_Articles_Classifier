As the nation's top-ranked team, the Buckeyes are now 72-12-1 all-time and 55-4 against unranked opponents when ranked No. 1 in the country. \nIn building the 21-point win over Maryland, the Buckeyes went six for six in the red zone, and all six of those drives resulted in touchdowns. \nLate in the game, the Terrapins faced a third-and-10 at their own 25-yard line late in regulation when quarterback Perry Hills dropped back to throw deep down the middle of the field, but sailed the ball beyond the reach of his teammate, and Ohio State safety Tyvis Powell was there for the interception. \nTwo plays later, quarterback J.T. Barrett ran around left end, tip-toed his way down the sideline and sprinted into the end zone for his second touchdown of the day, which gave the Buckeyes a 49-21 lead over the Terrapins. \nAlready up by two touchdowns, the Buckeyes got a stop on a turnover on downs, and the offense responded by turning that defensive stand into a touchdown, which gave them a 42-21 lead over the Maryland Terrapins with 6:38 to play in the game. \nBarrett started the drive and needed just five plays to lead the Buckeyes into the end zone. \nBarrett rushed for a gain of 25 yards on the first play of the drive and moved the Buckeyes down to Maryland's 34-yard line, and then, running back Ezekiel Elliott gained 19 yards on back-to-back runs. After Barrett was stopped behind the line for a one-yard loss, Elliott took the ball from Barrett and sprinted around left end for a 16-yard touchdown. \nBarrett showed his versatility by running for a one-yard touchdown that put the Buckeyes in front of the Terrapins, 35-21, with just 15 seconds left in the third quarter. \nThe Buckeyes started their second scoring drive of the third quarter at their own 34-yard line, and with Cardale Jones at quarterback, they marched to Maryland's 15. Then, as they had earlier in the game, the Buckeyes went to Barrett, and he finished off the drive by rushing for seven yards over the next four plays, including the touchdown run. \nAfter forcing a three-and-out on defense, the Buckeyes needed just one play to retake the lead against Maryland, 28-21, with 6:58 to play in the third quarter. \nAfter Maryland's punt was downed at its own 48-yard line, Jones found halfback Jalen Marshall behind the coverage of the secondary and delivered the throw to the sophomore playmaker, who found his way into the end zone for his second touchdown, and longest catch, of the season. \nThe Terrapins got the ball to start the second half, and they took full advantage of the possession. \nAlready with momentum on their side after a late touchdown run in the second quarter, the Terrapins marched 69 yards in nine plays and drew even with the Buckeyes, 21-21, with 11:17 to play in the third period. \nMaryland's Hills completed three straight passes to start the second half, which totaled 23 yards, and the Terrapins got an extra 15 yards on a roughing-the-passer penalty against Ohio State All-American defensive end Joey Bosa. Initially called for targeting the quarterback, Bosa was only assessed a roughing penalty after further review. \nThe penalty moved the ball from midfield to Ohio State's 31-yard line, and three plays later, Hills extended the drive with a three-yard rush on third-and-three. Three plays later, he ran through Ohio State's interior defense and into the end zone for his second rushing touchdown of the game. \nHills called his own number on first-and-goal from Ohio State's three-yard line and cut the Buckeyes' lead over the Terrapins to 21-14 with just 43 seconds left to play in the first half. \nBefore finishing the scoring drive with the three-yard gain, Hills and the Terrapins faced a first-and-15 from their own 22-yard line after a false-start penalty backed them up five yards. However, Hills was undeterred by the early setback. After taking the snap from center, Hills sprinted through all three levels of Ohio State's defense and gained 75 yards before being tackled inside the five. \nMaryland's second scoring drive of the game was set up by a missed 44-yard field goal by Ohio State kicker Jack Willoughby. \nOhio State stuck with Jones after they reached the red zone, and it paid dividends as he tossed a 19-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver Braxton Miller, a score that gave the Buckeyes a 21-7 lead over Maryland with 6:41 to play in the first half. \nAfter being pulled in favor of Barrett on each of the Buckeyes' previous two trips inside the red zone, Jones ran a fast-paced offense and moved the Buckeyes 61 yards in eight plays, which prompted Meyer to leave him in the game for the next play, which turned into a touchdown as he fired a pass to the right front corner of the end zone, where Miller jumped to haul in the score. \nOn the previous play, Jones connected with Miller on a 33-yard gain. On second-and-nine from Ohio State's 48-yard line, Jones took the shotgun snap and dropped back into the pocket, where he surveyed the field and found Miller striding past Maryland's secondary down the middle of the field. Jones tossed the ball down the field and Miller dove to catch the ball at full extension for the first down. \nHad it not been for college football's rule that a player is down when his knee touches the ground, Miller would have had enough time to get up and run the final 19 yards for a touchdown. \nEarlier in the drive, Jones flared a pass out to Elliott in the right flat, and the junior ran for a gain of 11 yards before being knocked out of bounds. Just two plays earlier, Elliott ran for a gain of two yards on fourth-and-inches at Ohio State's 29-yard line. \nElliott rushed for a two-yard touchdown run and gave the Ohio State Buckeyes a 14-7 lead over the Maryland Terrapins with 14:32 to play in the first half. \nOn third-and-goal, Elliott took a handoff from Barrett, plowed his way through Maryland's front seven defenders and punctuated the Buckeyes' six-play, 40-yard touchdown drive with his ninth rushing score of the season. \nOhio State's drive started when the defense forced Maryland to punt the ball, but offsetting penalties negated the first kick, which worked in favor of the Buckeyes, as Marshall, a preseason All-American returner, shook off a couple initial tackle attempts and got a block that sprung him for a gain of 28 yards on the 39-yard kick from Nicolas Pritchard. \nOn first-and-10 from Maryland's 40-yard line, Jones completed a 14-yard pass, and then, from a Wildcat formation, former Buckeyes signal-caller Braxton Miller took a snap from center and ran for an eight-yard gain. \nThe Buckeyes then inserted Barrett into the game at quarterback, and he rushed for a gain of a yard. Three plays later, the Buckeyes were in the end zone. \nOhio State head coach Urban Meyer hinted at the fact that he might tinker with the idea of putting Barrett behind center when the Buckeyes got in the red zone, and although it happened outside of the 20-yard line, the plan had positive results. \nBarrett rushed for a three-yard touchdown that drew the Buckeyes even with the Terrapins, 7-7, with 4:23 to play in the first quarter of their Big Ten Conference home opener. \nAfter Jones rushed for a gain of eight yards down to Maryland's 25-yard line, Meyer made the switch to Barrett, and he immediately moved the ball down the field. Following Barrett's six-yard rush, the Buckeyes committed a five-yard penalty and lost a yard on back-to-back rushes. However, on third-and-16, Barrett threw a 20-yard pass to wide receiver Michael Thomas, which gave Ohio State a first-and-goal from Maryland's five. \nTwo plays later, Barrett called his own number on the quarterback draw, rushed up the middle of the field and dove through Maryland defenders to reach the end zone for the touchdown, his first rushing score of the season, and finish off what was a 14-play, 75-yard drive for the Buckeyes. \nAfter getting shut out by the University of Michigan Wolverines last week, the Terrapins came out firing against Ohio State and took a 7-0 lead over the top-ranked Buckeyes on a 52-yard touchdown pass with 10:52 to play in the first quarter. \nFacing a first-and-10 from their own 48-yard line after converting a third-and-two on the previous play, the Terrapins took to the air, as Hills would wide receiver D.J. Moore wide open behind Ohio State's secondary. Moore hauled the pass and scooted his way across the goal line for his second touchdown of the season. \nMaryland's seven-play, 82-yard drive took just 2:21 off the first-quarter clock and followed Ohio State's opening drive of the game, which was a three-and-out. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LohJtD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:55:52.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
