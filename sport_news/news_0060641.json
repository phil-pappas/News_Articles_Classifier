He's never advertised his product, never put up a billboard on a highway, never had a website. Most of the time, Lannom doesn't even answer the shop phone.\nIf you order a buggy today, it would be ready in about three years. Lannom has 40 of these Texas-popular vehicles on order. You could also buy one of Lannom's ranch buggies Thursday at the Treasure Street Auction benefiting Scottish Rite Hospital for Children.\nFull details about the event at Old Parkland are online at treasurestreet.com.\nLannom donates a ranch buggy to the Treasure Street Auction every year. One of them sold for a record $61,000.\n\"The basic buggy that I sell costs $15,000 and it goes up from there, depending on the options,\" said Lannom. \"I think the most expensive one that I've built was $22,000. I can put dog boxes on them for quail hunters. I can add a top and a winch and extra seats, just about anything you want. I painted one pink for a lady bird hunter.\"\nSome West Texas ranchers own as many as 15 of Lannom's buggies, which are something of an ATV with a Volkswagen soft-ride suspension and a Volkswagen air-cooled engine. They're two-wheel drive but still capable of going just about anywhere another motorized vehicle might bravely or foolishly venture.\nLannom donated a buggy to Texas A&M's wildlife research program. Dale Rollins calls it \"the pride of the A&M fleet.\" Graduate students use it for traveling to research sites around the rugged Rolling Plains Quail Research Ranch in Fisher County (west of Abilene). Rollins is ranch director. He liked the buggy so much he bought one three years ago.\n\"I love to have my buggy in some rough country with a new rider, hit the gas, and watch them reach for something to hang onto,\" said Rollins. \"Once we've crossed the rough spot, I will point out that they could have sipped a martini and not dripped a drop.\"\nThe secret, said both Lannom and Rollins, is the suspension, built soft enough for a comfortable ride but tough enough to take a daily beating on West Texas ranches so big their size is often described in sections (640 acres) rather than acres.\nRanchers use them for work once done by horseback and also to save wear and tear on heavy-duty pickup trucks that cost $60,000 or more.\nLannom once sold a buggy to a rancher who'd gotten too old to ride horses. The rancher's son later told Lannom that the buggy had extended his father's active life by 10 years. Though Lannom figures the vehicle's top speed at about 50 mph, the old rancher claimed 65 mph for his.\nRollins recalls having his buggy stuck twice, both times in deep mud. He was able to winch it out.\n\"If you get hung up on a rock, you take a pry bar, scoot the buggy over a little and go again,\" he said. \"They're pretty incredible.\"\nEach buggy is built by hand, often welded and otherwise assembled by local kids. Lannom has hired them as young as 12 and taught them the fine points of welding and auto mechanics. One youngster, busy in school and in athletics after school, came to work each day at 3 a.m. and worked until it was time for class. His dad drove him to work because he was too young for a driver's license.\nLannom, 68, plans to continue his tradition of donating a ranch buggy to the Treasure Street auction. He personally knows families who have benefited from the Scottish Rite Hospital for Children.\n\"Every year, I get thank-you notes from kids, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, all thanking me for the donation,\" he said. \"When you think about the kids you're helping, it makes the work worthwhile.\"\nCALENDAR SATURDAY, OCT. 17 : Optimist Club of Grand Prairie's annual Big Bass Bonanza Tournament benefiting the youth of Grand Prairie.
