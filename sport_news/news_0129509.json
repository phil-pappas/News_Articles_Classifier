(AP) â€” Jay Cutler led the Bears to a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns, the second an alert toss to Matt Forte with 18 seconds left. \nKansas City lost star running back Jamaal Charles to a potentially season-ending right knee injury. \nChicago (2-3) trailed 17-3 early in the third quarter when Charles went down while trying to make a cut. The preliminary diagnosis was a torn ACL and Charles will have an MRI exam Monday. \nThe Bears quickly seized the momentum. \nAfter Robbie Gould's second field goal got them going, Cutler led an 88-yard drive that he capped with a 22-yard strike to Marquess Wilson with 3:05 left. The 2-point conversion came up short, but the Bears defense responded by forcing a quick three-and-out. \nWith help from a pass interference call on Chiefs rookie Marcus Peters, the Bears quickly moved downfield. That's when Cutler took a snap from the shotgun, dropped the ball, picked it up and spotted Forte running past safety Husain Abdullah in the end zone for the go-ahead score. \nThe Chiefs (1-4) tried a 66-yard field goal that came up short as time expired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:36:48.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
