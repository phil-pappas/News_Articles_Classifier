Plays ended when defenders ripped the ball-carrier to the ground. \nRyan Brown sniffed out a reverse and tackled the runner in the backfield. It foreshadowed the 3.5 tackles for loss the senior recorded in MSU’s 45-17 win against Troy on Saturday. \n“Anybody can do it unblocked,” MSU coach Dan Mullen barked at the defense as it celebrated. \nOn the next play, Brown rushed the edge and drove Nick Fitzgerald into the ground for the sack. \n“I really feel like he challenged the defense big time this week,” junior A.J. Jefferson said. “I feel like we answered the bell.” \nWithout Dak Prescott, who played only three series because of a stomach bug, the defense became the Bulldogs’ best unit. \nMississippi State (4-2) smothered Troy (1-4) in the backfield 15 times Saturday. The previous high this season was 13 against Northwestern State. The Bulldogs’ high against an FBS opponent was eight at Auburn. \nThe Bulldogs became the first team to hold a Gus Malzahn team without a touchdown. The first-team defense didn’t allow a touchdown against Troy. \nMississippi State's starters limited the Trojans to no gain or a loss of yards on 22 of their first 42 plays. At halftime, MSU had more points (38) than Troy had yards (31). \n“We had 11 guys on the field playing nasty,” Mullen said. “We told them, don’t step on that field unless you’re ready to play our style of defense and get after people. I saw the edge in practice this week.” \nEvery defender that spoke with the media leading up to this week’s game stressed the importance of turnovers. The Bulldogs created one in the last four contests. MSU hadn’t won the turnover margin this season. \nOn the third defensive play of the game, Brandon Bryant, starting his first-career game at safety, sacked the quarterback, causing a fumble. Nelson Adams pounced on the ball in the end zone, recovering the first fumble of the season for the Bulldogs. \n“It was a great way to get it started,” linebacker Beniquez Brown said. “Coach Mullen told us all the time, they come in bulk.” \nNelson’s touchdown put MSU up 14-0 in the first quarter. Beniquez Brown picked off a pass on third play of the second half with the score 38-0. It gave MSU its first win (2-0) in the turnover battle this season. \n“It started off Sunday night. We felt bad coming from Texas A&M,” Ryan Brown said. “We wanted to be the people to set the tone. That’s why we had a little bit of an edge.” \nMississippi State allowed 30 points on 322 yards passing and 516 yards against Texas A&M. All were season-highs. \nTroy eventually scored three times — two touchdowns and a field goal — in the second half. The majority of starters watched from the sideline when the Trojans crossed the goal line. \nTroy scored its second touchdown on a 74-yard run. \nAgainst the first-team defense, Troy’s longest play went for 16 yards. The Trojans didn’t have a positive yard total until its 10th play. \n“That’s the type of defense I expect us to play,” Mullen said. \nGAME SUMMARY Buy Photo Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott (15) releases a pass to Fred Ross in the first quarter.
