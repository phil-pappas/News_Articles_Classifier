So I didn’t understand the pressure that comes with failure, couldn’t give sound advice and guidance and couldn’t be as tolerant with people out of form as I should have been.\n“To be a good leader I’d also have needed to know how important families are, and how much you miss them.\n“How amazing it is to have kids, that your kids don’t care about what you score, how that joy of going home to them feels.”\nPietersen says family life with his popstar wife Jessica Taylor and five-year-old son Dylan has made him realise how important it is for cricketers to be close to their families, even on tour.\nEverything started pretty good with Kevin Pietersen’s captaincy. Source: News Limited\nThe 35-year-old said he noticed even before getting the sack how much he missed his family when separated on overseas cricket tours.\n“I didn’t get Steve Harmison’s homesickness issues, and all I could think was, ‘What’s wrong with you? You’re playing for England, you’re doing everything that you’re supposed to want to do,’” Pietersen wrote.\n“Basically, a tour can be a bit like going on holiday without any of the people you want to go on holiday with, and even though cricketers love playing cricket, it doesn’t change how important it is to be near to the people you love, and how it feels when you’re not.”\nLooking back, Pietersen admits he had the wrong approach to captaincy with his greatest weakness being trying to empathise and be positive with underperforming teammates.\nPietersen described one moment he still regrets from England’s first Test against India in December, 2008, which the Poms lost by six wickets.\nHaving set India 387 to win on a dusty pitch, England were expected to cruise to a 1-0 series lead.\nHowever, Pietersen revealed it all crumbled to pieces pretty quickly.\n“The highest score ever chased in India was 276 and the highest score ever chased at Chennai was 155, so we felt pretty safe,” he said.\nPietersen is set to drop a few bombs in his new book. Source: News Limited\n“We shouldn’t have. Statistics can be misleading at the best of times, but if the chasing team have Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar batting with the most ridiculous intensity you’ve ever seen, it really doesn’t matter what’s happened before. Whatever we did, Sehwag just kept whacking it, and that’s his greatness.\n“My weaknesses re-emerged. Harmy kept bowling short and wide, he kept getting cut, and I lost my patience, shouting, ‘Bowl the f***ing ball straight’.\n“Now, obviously, I understand the psychology of it: he’s getting hit in a certain area and he knows it’s because he’s bowling in a certain area, but the more he’s telling himself not to do it the more he’s scared of doing it, and the more he can’t do anything else.\n“I should have been helping him think positively, but I just didn’t understand the pressure he was under in the middle, or the pressure he felt at being away from home.\n“He needed a lot more encouragement, a lot more attention, and I didn’t treat him in the way that I should have — the way I would have treated him after I’d had Dylan.\n“Thinking about it now, that’s clearly how Michael Vaughan got the best out of Harmy, but I didn’t pick up on all that then. I was just a kid on a buzz and only interested in myself.”\n ‘Bowl the f***ing ball straight’", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/20/1227575/840527-ed6a241a-76d9-11e5-8562-88a509acffad.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/kevin-pietersen-admits-he-was-the-wrong-choice-to-captain-england/story-fndpt0dy-1227575840581", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/20/1227575/840992-d78a0d36-76d9-11e5-8562-88a509acffad.jpg", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:38:24.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
