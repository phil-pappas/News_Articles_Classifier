According to Brad Stevens, the assignment of roles is still very much a fluid proposition.\n Asked what conclusions could be drawn from the rotations when the Celts meet Olimpia Milano and Real Madrid, the coach said, \"Yeah, none. I think it’s very likely that we’ll start different lineups in each game overseas. We can certainly discuss it and talk about it, but I don’t think anything will be set in stone. I think you want to have it somewhat set by the time we start our last week of the preseason, as far as that week where we play the 19th, 22nd and 23rd, whatever it is.\"\n It's also important to note that Stevens doesn’t view positions in what has become the traditional manner.\n \"I go with ballhandlers, wings, swings and bigs, and that’s the way I look at the game,\" he said. \"I'd like to have two ballhandlers on the court at once, but that’s not always the case. It doesn’t always happen that way. I'd like to have multiple swing guys on the court at once, like Jonas [Jerebko] and Jae [Crowder]. That’s a good thing. But it doesn’t always happen that way.\n \"You try to mix and match the best that you can, so we’ll see. Ideally, when you sit in meetings right now, you say ‘Yeah, I’d like to be able to change starting lineups all the time,’ and all that stuff, but we’ll see if that fits in a plan and in reality see if it can work. I don’t know. Right now, I’m a lot more focused on, whoever is in the game, how they're playing.\"\n Added the coach, \"Everybody wants to start. Any of us that have ever played, everybody wants to play as much as they can and everyone wants to start. That’s just part of it. But it has no bearing on who will be in at the end, and it has no bearing on what will happen the next day, at least right now. So I’m a lot less concerned about who’s starting than how we're playing. I think for the most part our guys, everybody wants to [start], but our guys have been great about, ‘This is about us, and this is about our growth. We’re all going to get our opportunities whether we are in the rotation at the start of the season or not.' That’s the way it goes.\"\nGoals for the trip\n As he prepared for the Celtics' last practice and tonight's flight to Milan, Stevens has simple goals for the trip.\n \"Same as if we were here -- get better,\" he said. \"We only get a couple of days to practice, so hopefully those are good practices. But we’ll also, like, on the day of the games, our shootarounds will be more like a practice. It’ll be an hour and a half instead of an hour; [the players will] be taped. So we’re going treat this entire next couple of weeks like a practice, including the game days.\"\n And the coach purposely didn’t sound too excited when asked his happiness level with the club's progress.\n \"It’s OK,\" he said. \"But I’m a coach. I’m supposed to feel that way. I’m not going to say that, you know, we're ready to play in June today. But I feel like on Day 5 of 6, we're progressing at a reasonable rate. But we just have such a long way to go that it'd be silly for me to talk in exaggerating terms.\"\nDon't discount European opponents\n Because the Celtics aren't playing NBA opponents on this trip, some may not be expecting much from the competition. But Jerebko knows better.\n \"They're two top teams in Europe,\" he said of Olimpia Milano and Real Madrid, \"and they've been going at it I don't know how long, but for sure a couple of months. And they've played together before, so we should definitely not sleep on these teams. They're very good basketball teams, and they're all professionals. So, yeah, they're going to be great games.\n \"I played in the Italian league for two years, and I'm from Europe, so, yeah, I know what we're getting ourselves into.\"\n Looking at the opposition, Stevens said, \"We’ll have plenty of film, but this is still about our growth. I’ve said this before, they’ve been practicing for a while and certainly I’ve seen Milano play on film a little bit thus far, and I’ll get a little bit more into that. But I’m going to be focused on us for the most part. They're going to have us spinning with some of the things they do. They're advanced just in the time they’ve played together, and that’s a good thing right now. These are two accomplished teams that are used to winning and that will be another great challenge for us.\n \"I think this is a high, high level. I’m not worried about that. These two teams can run people out of the gym on any night, regardless of level.\"\n David Lee is looking at the trip for both short- and long-term benefits.\n \"We have two games over there that we want to win, that we want to play well in,\" he said. \"But more than anything, this is our preseason. This is continuing on and off the court to build towards opening night, and that means not only getting better in practice but also enjoying each other’s company off the court -- and getting to travel somewhere where we’re going to rely on hanging out with one another because we won’t have our families and our friends over there. It’s hanging out with your teammates and your coaching staff and the wonderful media members that make the trip and going from there. And I think that’s really important because early in the season we have a lot of new faces. This couldn’t come at a better time.\"\nEtc.\n Perry Jones missed the last two practices with a sore right knee, but he's traveling with the team to Europe. With 16 guaranteed contracts on the roster and an NBA maximum of 15 players for the regular season, Jones' Celtics future is very much on the line in these next three weeks. ...\n Lee on Stephen Curry calling him his favorite teammate: \"It means a lot. I mean, we went through a lot together, five years going from a 23-win team to a championship team. And I think it just goes to show... I think chemistry and character, I’m a big believer in those things when it comes to having team chemistry and working together towards a common goal.\n \"That’s why I’m so excited to be here in Boston. I think we have a similar makeup team-wise. While we don’t have a Steph Curry superstar on the team, we have a group that gets along well. And the best part is really working together to really get to where we want to be, and that’s to improve as a basketball team. And that’s really all it takes in this league, because everybody’s got talent. But what distinguishes from being a good to a great team is how guys can get along and how well you can work together toward a goal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:31:03.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
