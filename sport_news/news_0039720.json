Harvey was hit by a liner in Saturday's Game 1 win over the Cubs.\nHarvey said after the game his arm felt a little \"dented,\" but he stayed in after being hit in the sixth and completed 7 2/3 innings of two-run ball.\nThe right-hander is lined up to start again after being limited to just one outing in the NLDS. Team officials have said his availability will be monitored on a game-to-game basis.\nHarvey has thrown a career-high 202 innings, and he's 2-0 in the playoffs. \n\"We'll see how he is with the bruise and how it's going to affect him,\" manager Terry Collins said before Sunday night's game. \n\"He only threw [97] pitches [Saturday], which is very, very good. If you're going to come back on four days rest, keeping his pitch count where it was, I think it will be fine for him.\"\nBandaged apple \nA large bandage in the form of an \"X'' was placed on the home run apple in center field to celebrate the landing area of Travis d'Arnaud's blast in Saturday's 4-2 win over the Cubs.\nAssist, Cespedes \nWhile Yoenis Cespedes has struggled in the playoffs, Collins believes his slugger has played a role in Daniel Murphy's hot streak.\n\"When you're on the other side of the field, Cespedes is somebody you've got to worry about,\" Collins said. \"Dan is always going to have protection because they don't want to pitch to him. He's going to get pitches to hit.\"\nHendricks gets call \nThe Cubs will start Kyle Hendricks in Game 3 against Jacob deGrom on Tuesday night. Hendricks threw six scoreless innings at Citi Field on June 30.\nâ€” Matt Ehalt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:40.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
