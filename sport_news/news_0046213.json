(AP) - A biofuel plant in bankruptcy has paid $1.1 million it owed for local taxes in Mississippi.\nThe Commercial Dispatch reports ( http://bit.ly/1KgIGdl ) that the Texas-based company, KiOR, paid the money Thursday, eight months late.\nLowndes County Tax Collector Greg Andrews says KiOR originally owed just over $1 million, but a 1 percent penalty was added each month after the February deadline.\nAndrews says the Lowndes County School District will receive $376,000, and Lowndes County and Columbus will receive $364,000 each.\nKiOR built a $200 million plant designed to convert wood chips to fuel, but the plant has not operated since late 2013. Its equipment was sold for $3.7 million.\nThe state of Mississippi provided incentives for KiOR, and is expected to recover little of the $79 million it's seeking in repayment.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
