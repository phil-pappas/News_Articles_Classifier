TCU survives Kansas State’s upset bid 1 / 1 Back to Gallery MANHATTAN, Kan. — Trevone Boykin threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns, the second a 55-yard strike to Josh Doctson with 1:10 left in the game, and second-ranked TCU rallied from a big halftime deficit to beat Kansas State 52-45 on Saturday night.\nBoykin also ran for 124 yards and two scores for the Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who trailed 35-17 at the break. Madison product Aaron Green added 124 yards and two touchdowns rushing, while Doctson caught eight passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns.\nNone was bigger than his catch-and-run just 30 seconds after Jack Cantele had connected on a 37-yard field goal for Kansas State (3-2, 0-2) to knot the game at 45-all.\nThe Wildcats had won 49 straight games when leading at halftime before last week’s loss at Oklahoma State. Now, coach Bill Snyder ’s crew has lost two in a row.\nKansas State had an opportunity to respond to the Doctson touchdown, but quarterback Joe Hubener fumbled before the Wildcats could get anything going.\nThe entertaining ending capped a game that was action packed, filled with highlights and momentum swings from both teams.\nThings got exciting in a hurry. After receiving the opening kickoff, TCU scored on its first play from scrimmage with a simple run up the gut. Green took a handoff and darted through the teeth of K-State’s defense for an 86-yard score.\nBut Kansas State proved to be every bit as efficient when its offense was on the field. The Wildcats excelled on the ground, with Hubener running 26 times and Charles Jones 13 times. Together, they combined for six touchdowns.\nThe Wildcats possessed the ball for almost 23 minutes, keeping the Horned Frogs off the field and allowing them to build an improbable 35-17 lead.\nBut TCU flexed its muscles in the second half, sparked by Wagner product Derrick Kindred intercepting a pass and returning it 60 yards for a touchdown on the opening drive of the third quarter.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/61/8772714/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/61/8772714/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:11:16.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
