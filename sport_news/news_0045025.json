(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) Sponsored Links The Associated Press ANN ARBOR, Mich. â€” \nJalen Watts-Jackson grabbed a flubbed punt and lumbered 38 yards into the end zone for a touchdown on the final play of the game, giving No. 7 Michigan State a shocking 27-23 win over No. 12 Michigan in one of college football's most unlikely endings. \nWith the Wolverines ahead 23-21 and 10 seconds left, Michigan punter Blake O'Neill bobbled a low snap, and spun around to try and make the kick. But he was hit, the ball popped free and Watts-Jackson caught it, broke a few tackles in the final yards and made it into the end zone. \nMichigan State improved to 7-0, 3-0 in the Big Ten. Michigan fell to 5-2, 2-1.
