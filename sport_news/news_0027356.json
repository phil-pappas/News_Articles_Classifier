(Durant) played well, but he didn't get way ahead where we couldn't catch him. So, he kept everybody — the last group kept everybody in the game.\"\nDurant closed with a 68. Needing to hole out from the fairway on the 18th to force a playoff, he hit close to set up his final birdie. He missed a 4-foot birdie putt on 17.\n\"You've got make a four there,\" Durant said. \"I knew that (Lehman) had made a three, and from the crowd, I figured he made a birdie on 18, too. He just finished great. He did what you have to do to win a golf tournament out there, and I just finished a little short.\"\nBernhard Langer and Kenny Perry tied for third at 10 under. Langer shot a 68. Perry, the second-round leader, had a 70. Colin Montgomerie tied for fifth at 8 under after a 66.\n\"So disappointing in many ways, the week to be honest, but that's my best finish here,\" Montgomerie said. \"At least I got a top 10 here.\"\nMontgomerie took sole possession of first place in the Charles Schwab Cup race, 39 points ahead of Jeff Maggert after they began they week tied.
