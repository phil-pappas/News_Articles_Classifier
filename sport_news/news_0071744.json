A true ambassador of the sport, Genai was a member of the United States Men's National Water Polo Team for 12 years, playing in the 2004 Athens Olympics, 2003 & 2007 Pan American Gold Medal games, as well as multiple World Championships. Assistant camp directors include Felix Mercado, Head Men's and Women's Water Polo Coach at Brown University and John Abdou, who previously served as the Head Men's and Women's Water Polo Coach at Bucknell University prior to accepting the role as Executive Director of the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches (ACWPC). Genai directs the annual program for water polo players of varying skill levels, providing a multi-faceted experience for each athlete. “Not only does Genai have the playing and coaching experience, but his passion and energy for the game has the impact to bring out the best in the athlete,” states Paul Merrion, Vice President of US Sports Camps, “Winter in the Tropics is well-rounded combination of in-water instruction, dry-land fitness and an educational seminar making it a quality experience”.\nThe program provides a low camper to instructor ratio focusing on position specific training for drivers, shooters and goalies. Fundamental passing, shooting, team and individual defense along with tactical discipline and individual aspects of the game are emphasized and demonstrated in water by the staff on a daily basis through drills and scrimmages.\nOvernight campers reside at the Extended Stay America located ten minutes from Ransom Everglades.
