PGA Tour moves from one season to the next — too quickly 1  /  2 Back to Gallery Odds and ends as golf catches its breath, ever so briefly: \n•One season ended Sunday in Atlanta, when Jordan Spieth ’s final putt tumbled into the hole at the Tour Championship (a fitting conclusion). The next season starts Oct. 15, when a player not named Spieth hits the first shot of the Frys.com Open.\nAnd the Warriors think their offseason vanished quickly?\nThe PGA Tour scheduled exactly 17 days between the final round in Atlanta and the first round in Napa. That’s not even taking into account next week’s Presidents Cup in South Korea.\nGolf is in a great place, no question, even with Tiger Woods recovering from another surgery and Phil Mickelson fading away. The tour is riding a fresh wave of energy, fueled by captivating young players — from Spieth and Rory McIlroy to Jason Day and Rickie Fowler .\nThis doesn’t make over-scheduling a smart move. The Frys launches a six-week stretch of fall tournaments, right through the Sunday before Thanksgiving, most lacking big-name players, all relegated to sporting obscurity in the thick of football season.\nFrys officials snagged the leadoff spot and moved to a desirable destination, to give their event a little cachet. And tour officials helped by striking a deal to bring several top players, including McIlroy, to this year’s tournament.\nBut what golf really needs is a break. Take three months off. Let fans digest one season and allow anticipation to build for the next.\nThose three months will disappear in no time at all. Just ask Stephen Curry .\n• Anthony Kim should serve as a cautionary tale for Spieth and other rising 20-something golfers with a bright future — namely, nothing is assured. Not at all.\nKim once counted as the game’s next great star. He won three times before turning 25, led the U.S. to a stirring victory in the 2008 Ryder Cup and also represented his country in the ’09 Presidents Cup at Harding Park.\nThen, beset by injuries, Kim fell off the radar. His hard-partying ways probably didn’t help, but now he’s 30, hasn’t played in a PGA Tour event in more than three years and sounds resigned to not returning anytime soon.\n“Golf is a fond memory of mine,” Kim told the Associated Press this week, in his first interview in three years. “I’ve been watching more and more. I miss the competition a little bit. Watching these young guys like Jordan Spieth is bringing me back to watch.”\nAsked if this were enough to bring him back to play, Kim replied, “I’m going to step away from the game for a little while and get my body pieced together … I’ve got so much ground to make up from injuries: rotator cuff, labrum, spinal fusion, hand injury. I’ve had six or seven surgeries in the last 3½ years.”\nOne injury, sadly, can launch a debilitating cycle.\n•Sometimes, the littlest name produces the best story.\nEsteban Toledo won the First Tee Open on Sunday at Pebble Beach. Toledo outlasted a strong Champions Tour field, including five Hall of Famers — Tom Watson , Colin Montgomerie , Vijay Singh , Fred Couples and Mark O’Meara — who finished five or fewer shots behind him.\nToledo is a journeyman, winless in 290 starts on the PGA Tour. He’s notable mostly as one of the few tour pros who grew up in Mexico; he used to keep a rolled-up Mexican flag inside his putter grip.\nToledo also remembers his poor upbringing in Mexicali. That’s where the Esteban Toledo Family Foundation Home soon will open, housing about 20 orphans at first.\n“It’s one of the greatest accomplishments I’ve ever had and dreamed in my life,” Toledo told golfdigest.com. “Sometimes it’s not about me or you. It’s about helping others in this world.”\nToledo financed the home by donating 10 percent of his Champions Tour earnings — which means $30,000 for Sunday’s victory, more than $107,000 this year and north of $300,000 since he joined the Champions Tour in October 2012.\nWatson winning at Pebble would have been cool, but it’s hard not to root for Toledo.\n•Spieth, Fowler and Bubba Watson will lead the U.S. in the Presidents Cup. Day and Adam Scott headline the International team.\nMickelson’s addition to the U.S. squad, as a captain’s pick by Jay Haas , didn’t overwhelm NBC analyst Johnny Miller . “If nothing else, he’ll be good in the team room,” Miller said on a conference call Wednesday.\nThe Presidents Cup returns to San Francisco in 2025. Consider this your 10-year notice.\n•Curry and Warriors teammate Andre Iguodala will play in the Frys pro-am at Silverado on Oct. 14. That’s some MVP clout right there.\nRon Kroichick is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
