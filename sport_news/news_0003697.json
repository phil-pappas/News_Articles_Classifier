For the first two games, the Eagles relied on the no-huddle spread without much success. \nTo take advantage of his speedy and versatile personnel, especially two dynamic playmakers in senior running back Kris Thornton and senior wide receiver Desmond Woodson, Samuels took a page out of the Mike and Kyle Shanahan playbook. Samuels, a former all-Pro left tackle for Washington, served a one-year internship with the Redskins in 2010 as part of the NFL’s Minority Coaching Fellowship program and learned, from among others, a pro-style offense the Shanahans ran while coaching in Washington. \nSamuels wanted a more balanced attack that emphasized establishing the run game first out of the I-formation and then called on the passing game to open things up through play action. Samuels conferred with offensive coordinator Steve Schultze about installing the changes. Schultze saw the wisdom in the move and the following week’s practice began with a different scheme. \nOn top of adjusting to a new coach, it took time for the players to understand the scheme’s language. But after becoming familiar with the system and what Samuels and his coaching staff expected, the players developed a rhythm that’s allowed them to play their best football of the season right now in a timely way. \nWinners of three of its last four games, Osbourn (1-0 Conference 8, 3-4 overall) hosts Battlefield (1-0, 5-2) for homecoming Friday at 7 p.m. with plenty at stake. Besides facing the conference’s top team, the Eagles are in the hunt for their first playoff berth since 2011. Sixteen teams qualify for the 6A North Region postseason. This week’s Virginia High School League power point ratings list Osbourn at No. 17. \nThe Eagles have more wins than the three teams ahead of them, but strength of schedule has hurt their rating. Osbourn’s three wins have come against teams with a combined 1-19 record. While a loss to Battlefield doesn’t end the Eagles’ playoff chances, a victory would go a long way toward solidifying their prospects. \nA big reason for the turnaround is the offense. The spread was a staple of Schultze’s offenses in his 10 seasons as Osbourn’s head coach. The Eagles went 74-44 in that time, including a Group AAA Division 6 state title in 2006 and six playoff appearances in Schultze’s final seven seasons. While the spread remains a part of the package, the run-first philosophy is a better fit. To help the skill players’ digest the play quicker, Schultze takes extra time to create wristbands for each of them. \nOsbourn returned key skill players from last year’s 3-7 team, who all showed flashes of what they were capable of in 2014, in particular Thornton, who rushed for 179 yards in Osbourn’s final regular-season game, Woodson, who returned a kickoff for a touchdown, and junior quarterback Anthony Pearson. The pieces were in place. It was a question of how best to use them. \nAfter Hylton, Osbourn played at Potomac and saw an immediate difference. The Eagles were hampered by three turnovers and 10 penalties for 66 yards in the 14-12 loss, but they almost rallied to a win after trailing 14-0 at halftime. \nThe 5-foot-8, 150-pound Woodson has been the go-to receiver, amassing five 100-plus yard receiving games in his last six outings. His best performance was last Friday when he totaled seven receptions for 164 yards and three touchdowns in Osbourn’s 33-28 win over Stonewall Jackson. The 5-8, 160-pound Thornton, along with senior JayQuan Waters, gives Osbourn a nice one-two punch out of the backfield. Thornton leads the team in rushing with 440 yards and eight touchdowns and is tied over with Woodson for the team scoring lead with 54 points.
