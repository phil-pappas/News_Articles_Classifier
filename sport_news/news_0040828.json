It is understood that McAllister took training on Thursday despite hearing the news that he would not be retained in his current role. \nLiverpool would not confirm any of these reported changes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:23:39.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
