We'll delve into many of the highlights from the sixth week of the high school football season.\n Don't forget to join Tyler Sullivan and myself tonight at 6 p.m. for the Monday Night High School Football Show on Boston Herald Radio.\n The Game of the Week didn't start out as such, but it sure finished that way. No. 2 St. John's Prep jumped out to a quick 21-0 lead, but Catholic Conference rival BC High rallied to tie the score at 21 with less than two minutes remaining in regulation on a 31-yard TD run by Marco King.\n The Prep took the lead in overtime when Ollie Eberth scored on a 1-yard QB keeper then connected with Dillon Preston for two. King scored again, but the ensuing 2-point pass attempt failed, giving SJP a 29-27 win.\n The Upset of the Week took place in Scituate where the Sailors avenged last year's loss to Middleboro in style. Charlie Malone rushed for 90 yards and three touchdowns, while Colin May rushed for 81 yards and also caught three passes for 34 yards and a score in an impressive 34-13 victory over the previously unbeaten Sachems.\n NEXT MAN UP: When you lose a three-year starting quarterback like Mike Milano, the natural thought is that Central Catholic would struggle at the position. Sophomore Bret Edwards has been more than adequate at the position for the Raiders. In last week's title clinching 30-14 win over Andover, Edwards completed 12-of-20 passes for 201 yards and three scores.\n THIEVES IN THE NIGHT: Dartmouth's defense played a pivotal role in its 34-20 nonleague victory over New Bedford. Matt Craig and Jack Sullivan both returned interceptions for touchdowns to fuel the win. With Somerset Berkley and Dighton-Rehoboth losing, the Indians gained some ground in the Division 3 Southeast ratings.\n DON'T PLAY DARTS WITH THIS GUY: Marblehead quarterback Garret Keough was the picture of perfection against Lynn Classical. He completed all 13 passes he attempted for 244 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-7 victory over Lynn Classical, clinching the Northeastern Conference North title.\n NO LOVE FOR LOVEY IN NATICK: Walpole running back Lovey Salvant had a career night at the expense of longtime gridiron rival Natick. Salvant rushed for a career-high 295 yards and four touchdowns on 13 carries in a 42-7 victory over the Redhawks.\n LONG OVERDUE IN RANDOLPH: Randolph exorcised some longtime demons in its 34-28 victory over Rockland. The win marked the first win over the Bulldogs since a 40-6 victory on Nov. 28, 1996. Demarco Durham threw for 175 yards and three touchdowns, while Darius Banks returned an interception 47 yards for a score as Randolph erased a 21-12 halftime deficit.\n NOT SO GENTLE BEN: What was billed as a showdown between two of the two junior quarterbacks in the state (Westford's Connor Degenhardt and Newton South's Austin Burton), quickly turned into the Ben Cassidy Show. The Westford running back raced for 224 yards and three toucdowns in a 21-4 victory.\n WE GET A KICK OUT OF RANDY: Waltham's Randy Alay solidified his reputation as the premier kicker in the state. The UMass-bound senior booted three field goals, including a game-winning 28-yarder on the final play, to give the Hawks a 16-14 over Lincoln-Sudbury.\n EXTRA TIME DETERMINES THE WINNER: Greater Lowell and Lynn Tech got together Saturday night and had a contest for the ages. The teams were tied at 35 heading into the extra session.\n Lynn Tech fed workhorse back Steffan Gravely and he responded with a 1-yard TD run to give them a 41-35. The extra point attempt, however, was blocked.\n Greater Lowell quarterback Nick Rossetti threw his third TD pass of the night to Eli Bryant to tie the score. Jon Sheridan hit the extra point to give the Gryphons a 42-41 victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:25:06.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
