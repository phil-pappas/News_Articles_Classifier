He was released on Saturday night.\nHe went to the circuit medical centre on Sunday morning for further checks and a final examination.\nHis mechanics repaired his car and he started from the back of the grid.\nBefore jumping back in his car he said: \"There are no bruises, but as you can imagine I am a bit stiff, and a bit sore from yesterday.\n\"But it is nothing that a painkiller cannot kill and for sure I will start the race, and if I cannot move my neck or something, I will stop.\n\"I feel perfectly capable of doing the start and participating in the race and going for it.\"\nHe added: \"The accident was a tough one, but it is already at the back of my mind. Turn 13 on the first lap will be a bit emotional, but from then on it will all be back to normal.\n\"I am more than ready to race and my mind is telling me all the time to race, to race, to race. And that is the best thing I can do at the moment.\n\"The first thing I did when I got to the hospital was look at the crash to see what exactly happened, even though I could remember what had happened!\n\"I remember perfectly changing my brake shape before Turn 13 and just, when hitting the brakes, lost the rear of the car, hitting the first barrier and approaching the next barrier.\n\"I remember everything perfectly - fortunately or unfortunately. When I watched the accident, I saw everything happened as my mind was remembering, so that's good!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:38:37.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
