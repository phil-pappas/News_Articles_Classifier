(JOURNAL FILE)\nAward-winning Pojoaque painter Mateo Romero filed a complaint in District Court last week seeking punitive and compensatory damages for an incident that took place in July 2014. According to the suit, Romero pulled into Maria Markus’ driveway on Old Santa Fe trails near Museum Hill to clean feces his Shih Tzu had produced in his car. Markus, wife of well-known photographer Kurt Markus, arrived and blocked Romero in the driveway while she called 911 to report a potential burglary. Markus told a dispatcher that Romero was trying to open her car door and reach inside.\nOfficer Christopher Mooney responded first and brandished an assault rifle and ordered Romero to the ground with the gun positioned toward his head, the complaint states. Romero was then handcuffed and placed in the back of a patrol vehicle for more than 20 minutes while officers arrived and investigated Markus’ story. The suit says Mooney did not tell Romero why he was placed in custody.\nWhen officers found no evidence of a crime, they let Romero out of the vehicle but kept him handcuffed, and the suit says Romero and now-retired police Capt. Louis Carlos talked for five minutes before the handcuffs were removed. Carlos then explained to Romero that it “was standard practice for SFPD to exhibit deadly force” when responding to such a call.\nSFPD Lt. Andrea Dobyns wouldn’t comment specifically on the case Tuesday, but she said officers generally have the option to approach a potential burglary call with deadly force .\n“It’s definitely something that is allowed,” she said. “Officers do have the discretion. Deadly force options are presented in these situations, but they don’t have to be.” Dobyns also said it is common to put someone in “investigative detention” to keep officers safe when they investigate a call.\nNo charges were filed against Romero. He is now seeking punitive and compensatory damages for alleged physical and psychological injuries.\nMarkus told the Journal after the incident that Romero was “rude and obnoxious” and used an old scarf to clean up the mess and later threw it in the bushes.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20080711043-640x457.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:42:56.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
