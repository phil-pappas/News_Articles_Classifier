I’ve got to keep getting better.” \nThe Huskies chipped in with a gift safety and senior Kaleb Patterson added a 36-yard field goal (1-6, 0-3) for Miami, which hadn’t reached the end zone since scoring two touchdowns in the fourth quarter of a 20-14 MAC loss at Kent State on Oct. 3. \nLed by redshirt freshman Alonzo Smith’s 57 yards on 11 carries, Miami gained 153 yards rushing, the most in four games — another little glimmer of progress for coach Chuck Martin. \n“We ran the ball better than we have in three weeks,” the second-year coach said. “We threw the ball better, but moving the ball is different than scoring points. \n“Defensively, we missed fits on an alarming number of plays. That should’ve been a closer game based on our maintaining the ball and not turning it over.” \nMissed fits were the main reason the Huskies (4-3, 2-1) were able to break four touchdown runs of at least 22 yards, including one of 73 and another of 53, senior linebacker Kent Kern said. \n“Once we got better at play recognition, we started doing a better job of fitting things right,” Kern said. \nThe RedHawks, outscored by a combined 79-15 over the last two games, have lost six straight and nine in a row to Football Bowl Subdivision teams dating to last season. Their only win in that span was a 26-7 non-conference victory over Presbyterian, a Football Championship Subdivision program, in the season opener. \nBahl, who was 8-of-23 for 150 yards and zero touchdowns with four interceptions at Ohio the previous Saturday in his first career start, needed just one half to increase his completions. Bahl was 9-of-18 in the first half against the Huskies. \nThe Huskies had piled up 128 yards of total offense in 10 plays to Miami’s three in six while opening up a 14-0 lead six minutes into the first quarter. They looked to be on their way to a third touchdown in three possessions before third-year sophomore cornerback Bert Birdsall forced a fumble that was recovered on Miami’s 18-yard line by sophomore safety Buchi Okafor. \nMiami again was forced to punt — fifth-year senior Christian Koch ended each of the RedHawks’ first five possessions with a punt and finished with nine — and NIU needed two plays to widen the lead to 21-0 on Joel Bouagnon’s second touchdown run of the game with 1:32 left in the first quarter. \nMiami shaved the NIU lead to 21-5 when NIU’s Aregeros Turner caught the RedHawks’ second-half kickoff in play and retreated to the end zone and took a knee for what he thought was a touchback, but it was confirmed after a replay review to be a safety. \nThe RedHawks drove to the NIU 16 after the subsequent free kick, but Bahl was intercepted in the end zone by Shawun Lurry, who went into the game leading the country with six pickoffs and has at least one in each of NIU’s last five games. Lurry returned it to the Huskies’ 47-yard line, and Bouagnon broke the game open with a 53-yard touchdown run on the next play. \nThird-year sophomore defensive end Zach Smierciak blocked a 46-yard NIU field-goal attempt with 13:11 left in the fourth quarter. Miami had to punt on the ensuing possession, but senior linebacker Josh Dooley pounced on the ball at NIU’s 34-yard line after it was fumbled, setting up Miami’s only touchdown. \nThe RedHawks play their fourth road game out of the last five next Saturday when they travel to Kalamazoo, Mich., to face Western Michigan at 2 p.m. The Broncos (3-3, 2-0) scored a surprisingly easy 49-14 win at Ohio (5-2, 2-1) on Saturday.
