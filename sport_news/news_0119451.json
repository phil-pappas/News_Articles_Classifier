It's different than having a friend. We go home together and are always around each other, giving each other great advice all the time.\"\nRyan and Pasha aren't the only Szklanys running for the Knights: their sister, sixth-grader Nina — also adopted from Russia, though unrelated to Pasha — is the top runner on Highlands Christian's girls team.\nCraig and Brenda Szklany, of Lighthouse Point, who have three biological children, of which Ryan is the youngest, brought Pasha and Nina home from Russia nearly 10 years ago. Members of Spanish River Church in Boca Raton, the couple was inspired to adopt the children, who had been orphaned in Tver, a military town situated between Moscow and St. Petersburg.\nHighlands Christian Academy families have something of a tradition of adoption, and it's one the Pompano Beach school is proud of, cross country coach Jarod Ebenhack said.\n\"A lot of our families in the local area who have kids that attend Highlands Christian or the Grace Baptist Church believe in adoption,\" Ebenhack said. \"When I was in school, one of my professors put it best when he said, 'There are so many kids out there who need parents, so why do you have to have all your children be biological?' It's a normal, natural thing for us.\"\nEbenhack would know. The fourth-year coach has two adopted sons, twin brothers Justin and Jaden, and an adopted daughter named Daphne, all from Haiti.\nEbenhack and his wife, Jennifer, served as missionaries for eight years on the tiny island nation. The couple, who helped establish Kids Alive Haiti in 2003, was drawn to the three orphans — Daphne and the twins aren't related — early in their missionary work and began the adoption process even before their biological kids, sixth-grader Dora and fourth-grader Brendan, were born.\nDora, a home-schooled sixth-grader in her first year on the girls cross country team, says all three of her adopted siblings are a lot of fun to be around.\n\"I don't know what it would be like if we didn't have them around because it would only be just me and my little brother,\" Dora said Dora. \"It's nice that I have an adopted sister because now I'm not alone.\"\nDaphne, an eighth-grader, is ranked No. 1 in the state in the shot put and is the No. 2 hurdler as part of the Highlands Christian varsity track team. She also plays volleyball at the middle school. Dora said Daphne's competitive intensity is what she admires the most.\nAlso a standout athlete, Justin helped Highlands Christian's cross country team to a district title last year and was named an all-conference selection. But the Highlands junior is also now getting into acting, which he said is his No. 1 passion. Currently taking a theatre class, he said he has worked with other students in \"Road To Hope,\" a 15-minute movie to raise awareness of human trafficking.\n\"Ever since I was little, I've loved the idea of becoming different characters and changing people's lives,\" said Justin, whose twin brother Jaden attends Bright Horizons School. \"I eventually want to become a director because I love the idea of creating beautiful stories that help impact people.\"\nHighlands Christian cross country has no shortage of such beautiful stories. Senior Steven Ludwig, in his fourth season on the Knights' cross country team, was adopted into the Ludwig family in 2007.\n\"To become a part of the Ludwig family was hands down the greatest day of my life because I felt I belonged,\" Ludwig said. \"That's how I feel about being a part of this team. It's an us-against-the-world mentality and we thrive on that.\"\njstromberg@tribpub.com / @JasonStromberg1\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5601dcd8/turbine/fl-highlands-christian-xc-adoptees-0923-20150922"], "published": "2015-09-22T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:05:38.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
