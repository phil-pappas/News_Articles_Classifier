His first two touchdowns were on short runs, but his last one, which secured victory, covered 10 yards with 1:47 remaining. Swoopes ran for 13 and 29 yards on the previous two plays.\nTexas (3-4, 2-2 Big 12) rushed for 274 yards, maintaining a strength the Longhorns created with 313 yards on the ground - its most since 2013 - during a victory against Oklahoma on Oct. 10.\nTailback Johnathan Gray led Texas with 103 yards against Kansas State (3-4, 0-4).\nCharles Jones, Kansas State's junior running back, rushed for a career-best 122 yards. Jones gained 87 in the second half.\nKansas State has lost four consecutive games for the first time since 2005.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
