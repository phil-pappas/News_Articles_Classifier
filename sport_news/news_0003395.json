Sheriff’s office spokeswoman Deputy Shannon Volkodav said Bullock’s arrest came after fellow deputies went to his Norcross home to serve him with “administrative paperwork.”\nThey “observed what appeared to be methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia in plain view inside the residence,” Volkodav said.\nVolkodav did not know how much of the drug was allegedly found. She said she was not at liberty to release information about the paperwork Bullock was being served.\nBullock has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. As of 6 p.m. Wednesday, he remained in jail in lieu of $5,700 bond.\nVolkodav said the deputy was assigned to the support services division. According to the sheriff’s office’s website, that division’s mission is “to develop officers of the highest caliber for the purpose of serving the citizens of Gwinnett County.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:04:52.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
