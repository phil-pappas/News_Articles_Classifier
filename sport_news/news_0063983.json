Through 29 NASL league games this season, Peiser, right back Ryan Richter and centre back Colin Falvey have played each of the 2,610 minutes Fury has been on the pitch. Fellow centre back Rafael Alves, with 2,544 minutes, and left back Mason Trafford, with 2,160, aren't far behind with the fivesome remaining unchanged since the spring season. \nDespite the workload, none of them seem the least bit tired, which is a good thing because Fury's season finale in Atlanta could very well be the match that decides who claims top spot in the league's combined standings. Fury could have locked that up Sunday had the San Antonio Scorpions beaten or tied the New York Cosmos, but the spring season champions managed to pick up all three points to move within two of Fury on the combined table. \nThough Marc Dos Santos may have given some of his big-minute players a game off had the Atlanta game not had any importance, he may have had a fight on his hands. While Richter said completing the regular season streak isn't a big deal, he has no interest in sitting one out. \n\"It's nice and I'm lucky I haven't had any injuries this year,\" he said of his run of consecutive games. \"I don't want to miss a game, no matter what it means. I'm pretty sure that everyone would say that.\" \nOn Friday, a day after returning from winning the fall season in Jacksonville, Falvey was asked if he needed some rest. \n\"Today? Yes,\" he said, laughing. \"But no, when next week comes around, I'll be good.\" \nHe said finishing the season without missing any time would be a \"nice accomplishment\" but said it was up to Dos Santos. \n\"If the (Atlanta) game ends up not meaning anything to us, I'll speak to Marc and make a decision.\" \nIf any of the players have any say, there likely won't be any changes at the back for Fury to close out the regular season schedule. \nAs for who Fury will be squaring off against in the NASL Championship semi-finals, that remains to be seen, though it's looking increasingly likely it will be the Tampa Bay Rowdies, who have a one-point lead over the Fort Lauderdale Strikers for the last of four spots. \n\"For us it doesn't matter (who Fury plays),\" said Falvey, whose side was presented with the fall season championship trophy prior to Sunday's Ottawa 67's game. \"The good thing is both teams probably won't relish coming up to the cold, so maybe there's a slight advantage there. But it's a semi-final, anything can happen.\" \nThe Irish defender has been on championship teams before but said what the club has accomplished so far - and could still accomplish - is pretty special. \n\"Everyone's aware of some of the other teams' budgets, so a new a club like us just finding our feet in the league (to make it this far), it's a huge accomplishment and right up there with anything I've done in my career.\" \nBut just how much does this team want to win the Soccer Bowl? \n\"A lot, I would say, to use descriptive language,\" forward Andrew Wiedeman said. \"You take it one at a time, though, and we still have work to do.\" \nLeague winners to be decided Saturday \nAs Fury FC closes out its regular season in Atlanta against the Silverbacks on Saturday, they'll be as hungry ever for the full three points. \nThanks to New York's win Sunday, the Cosmos are two points back of Fury for the combined title. Fury can claim the overall win with a victory in Atlanta and while a draw would also likely do the job based on Fury's better goal differential, Ottawa wants to take the mystery out of it early. \nNot to mention that if Fury loses its 4 p.m., they'll have to spend an agonizing couple hours watching the Cosmos play the Rowdies at 7 p.m. \n\"It's huge to get the combined title, which shows your the best team over the course of 30 games,\" forward Andrew Wiedeman said. \nFury will then host an as-yet-undetermined opponent in the Championship semi-finals at TD Place on Nov. 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:29:16.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
