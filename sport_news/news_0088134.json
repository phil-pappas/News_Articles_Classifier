A win in two weeks over Chapel Hill would clinch the region championship. Leading 7-0 midway through the second quarter, Allatoona put the game out of reach with two touchdowns right before halftime. A 31-yard run by Russell Halimon and a 34-yard touchdown catch by Michael Pynes from Brandon Rainey gave the Buccaneers a commanding 21-0 halftime lead.However, Allatoona was very fortunate the game wasn’t closer. The Patriots were able to drive inside the Buccaneers’ 5-yard line twice in the first half, but came up empty both times.“We got lucky early,” Allatoona coach Gary Varner said. “They had two chances inside the 10 and they didn’t get it done and then the momentum changed.”Rainey’s two third-quarter touchdowns — a 24-yard touchdown run and 19-yard pass to Brian Mitchell — as well as Charles Anderson’s 13-yard run in the third quarter increased Allatoona’s lead to 42-0.The Patriots were able to avoid the shutout as Caleb Sailors scored on a 1-yard run in the fourth quarter. That did not take away a solid defensive effort from the Buccaneers as they forced three turnovers and held Paulding County to 206 total yards.Hailmon’s ability to run the ball combined with Rainey’s good decision making with several rollout pass plays kept the Patriots off balance. Hailmon rushed for 150 of his 194 yards in the first half while Rainey was able to keep plays alive using his legs as he threw for 104 yards and rushed for 93. He also scored three touchdowns.Overall, the Buccaneers rushed for 400 yards and tallied 504 total yards.“We feel we can run and pass equally well,” said Varner. “We’ve got two good threats there (Rainey and Hailmon). We got the receivers that are doing their job blocking and then all of a sudden they pop open. So it’s been a good, balanced team this year.”Allatoona took an early 7-0 first quarter lead as Jaylen Parrish scored on an 11 yard touchdown run on its first offensive possession. With a region championship on the line in two weeks, Varner says the task is to keep improving.“We’re going to watch the film,” Varner said. “There’s going to be plenty of mistakes we can get better on and we’ll just try to keep going.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:31:46.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
