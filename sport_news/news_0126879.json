There are a number of concerns out there shared by the Premier League doctors and the association of medical practitioners on this.\n“It may well be that we need to think about more effective sanctions if the protocols that are currently in place are breached.\n“Maybe we need to think about it being a disciplinary offence if there are any interferences (by coaching staff) between the referee and the medical staff.\n“There’s a number of things we need to look at now and reflect on, on how better we can all be across the game when incidents like this happen. I sincerely hope that we see Eva Carneiro back in the game.”\nMourinho said that Carneiro and Fearn had been “impulsive and naive” by going onto the pitch to treat Hazard, but the Premier League Doctors’ Group said failure to do so would have been a breach of their care of duty.\nCarneiro, 42, is reported to be considering legal action against Chelsea, who have to date refused to comment on the matter.\nMourinho was last week cleared by the FA of making discriminatory remarks to her, but Carneiro subsequently complained that she had not been asked by the FA to make a statement about what had happened.\nFA chairman Greg Dyke, meanwhile, has called on Mourinho to apologise to Carneiro, who had been at the club since February 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:36:12.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
