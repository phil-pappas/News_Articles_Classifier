Coming off of a summer where he struggled at times to finish for Canada, Joseph has been the most pleasant of Raptors surprises early on, earning the praise of head coach Dwane Casey, who said Joseph “has been great.” \nWhen Joseph signed a four-year deal for $30 million US after the San Antonio Spurs were reluctantly forced to let him go to make room for premier free agent LaMarcus Aldridge, a few eyebrows were raised. The critics pointed out that Joseph had either been the backup or third-string point guard while with the Spurs and now would be paid like a key player. Those who had been watching closely realized that Joseph had starred for a few summers as the Canadian national team’s most effective performer, lit up the NBA Development League and most importantly, subbed in admirably for Tony Parker in 43 career starts, posting 9.3 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game on 51% shooting, along with his typically solid defence. \nJoseph was asked after practice on Monday whether he paid any attention to the reaction to his contract and whether he felt any extra pressure to prove himself. \n“I don’t know how to answer that because I don’t really base my game on what people think,” Joseph said. “I jut try to get better every day. I try to maybe prove that I can play within the organization, but outside the organization, I don’t really look at that stuff.” \nJoseph has made an immediate impact with his teammates. \nFellow newcomer Luis Scola has been gathering intel for years on Joseph from good friend Manu Ginobili, who played with Joseph in San Antonio. \n“I spoke with Manu about him quite a bit before, trying to figure out how to guard him,” Scola said of preparing for international contests for Argentina against Canada. “Now that I play with him, I ask (Ginobili) stuff of how to help him. He’s a good player, he’s trying to explore his game, take his game to the next level. I think he’s going to have a lot of opportunities here. He’s in great shape right now, he looks very good, very confident, so, hopefully he can keep that momentum going into the season. We’re expecting a great year from him.” \nHELPING HAND \nJoseph credits some of his early success with the Raptors to his time with new assistant coach Jerry Stackhouse . \n“Very experienced, had a career forever in the NBA, so it’s great to hear his views and his experiences and learning from him has been amazing,” Joseph said. “He’s been staying in my ear to be aggressive, (telling Joseph to) take my shots when it’s there, stay confident, and just pointing out the stuff that I’m doing wrong.” \nAt the end of every practice, Joseph and Stackhouse usually engage in a three-point shooting competition. Stackhouse does not look out of place. \n“Yeah, he can (still play),” Joseph said of the former North Carolina star. “He’s in incredible shape. He can still get out there and play with us.” \nNO CLARITY AT PF \nScola started at power forward for the first time on Sunday against Cleveland and Casey said he still doesn’t know who will begin the regular season as the first option at that position. \nPatrick Patterson has been extremely quiet and Scola showed well Sunday, making things a little more intriguing. \n“I thought he was solid. I thought his IQ was good, he was in the right places, he made the right decisions with his passes, he made his shots. He made them pay for putting a smaller four on him in the post, which was smart on his part,” Casey said. \nCasey would love to have Patterson on the floor often, primarily because of his ability to hit three-pointers, but pointed out that long-time starter Amir Johnson rarely provided that element yet was still a good fit. \n“You like to have more shooting, but you can’t have everything and Pat does give it that with his second unit,” he said. “I like what Scola brought, similar to what Amir brought last year, the rolling, the smartness, the rebounding, the defence, pick-and-roll defence was solid. He (took) a charge, so, a lot of positive things with him being in the lineup.” \nScola said he felt good with the first group and recognizes that the offensive expectations from him change when he plays with them compared to when he is expected to lead the bench in scoring.
