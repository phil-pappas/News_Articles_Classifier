Observer sports reporter Stephen Schramm was on hand as the Tar Heels discussed the 2015-16 season. \nBIG PICTURE \nThe mood at North Carolina these days is a buoyant one. \nNorth Carolina returns four starters and nine of the top 10 players from a team that reached the ACC tournament final and the Sweet 16. The Tar Heels are considered one of the favorites to win the ACC and a contender for the national title. \nWhile they know they have the potential to do great things, the Tar Heels are quick to point out that they haven’t done anything yet. \n“In ’05 I thought we were, if not the best, then one of the two best teams in the country,” Tar Heels coach Roy Williams said. “In ’09, I thought we were the best. I think this year, we’re one of the best. If we play well down the stretch, then we could be the best. But there’s a big difference there.” \nBIGGEST SURPRISE \nWhile senior guard Marcus Paige said he’s totally free of the foot issue that dogged him for much of last season, the Tar Heels are far from free of injury concerns. \nJunior center Kennedy Meeks has missed one practice and will likely miss three more after injuring his knee. Williams said he didn’t expect that injury to be a lingering issue. \n“He feels so much better already,” Williams said. \nFor sophomore guard Theo Pinson, things are a little more serious. \nPinson had surgery in May on his left foot. Pinson missed 10 games after breaking a bone in the foot in January. He returned but sat out four more games due to problems with the foot. \nAs a result of the procedure, Pinson hasn’t played basketball at all this summer. He only returned to the court last week. Williams said that during the Tar Heels’ first six practices, Pinson has been extremely restricted. There was one in which he was held out. However, Pinson is expected to be back up to speed by the time the Tar Heels start their third week of practice. \nLikely filling the role of starting shooting guard, Pinson understands the team’s cautious approach. \n“You see your teammates out there battling, playing the game I love, the game they love, it’s rough just sitting over there because I’ve been wanting to play for a long time,” Pinson said. “But at the same time, I know it’s a long season. I’d rather play then, than hurt it in practice.” \nBIGGEST QUESTION \nThis season’s North Carolina team should be fine. However, the program’s future is cloudy. \nThe punishment from the NCAA’s probe into academic fraud at the university’s African and Afro-American Studies department likely won’t be announced until after the season is over. But the effects of the scandal have been felt on the recruiting trail for several years. \nNorth Carolina’s most recent class consisted of two players, neither of which was a top 50 recruit. The commitment of five-star Florida post player Tony Bradley was an encouraging step, but there’s still plenty of ground for the Tar Heels to make up. \nWilliams addressed the troubles the Tar Heels have faced. \n“It’s disheartening, there have been some negative things said, but it’s what it is,” Williams said. “We’ve had some problems and they’ve been very evident for a long time and they’ve hurt us for a long time, but it is what it is.” \nNorth Carolina is still in the running for several high-level recruits in the class of 2016 and already has a commitment from highly-regarded 2017 guard Jalek Felton. \n“I tell them what I know, that the NCAA thing’s not over yet and we have to wait and see,” Williams said when asked what he tells recruits. “There’s no allegations toward men’s basketball. We feel good, but it’s not over yet. Do I feel good about what happened? Heck no. I’m mad about it, embarrassed about it, sad about it. All those statements. But I’m not going to go around and put my head in the sand and say ‘We didn’t do nothing, everybody’s just saying bad things about us.’ We had some mistakes made. At the same time, I feel pretty doggone good about what we’ve done right here. It’s hard to separate that for some people.” \nQUOTABLE \n“No. There’s a sense of urgency to get my dadgum knees feeling better. I had two surgeries this summer. I’m not moving around as well as I’d like. I haven’t gotten down in a defensive stance yet this year. I haven’t tried to show them how to deny or anything like that. … My golf game was terrible all dadgum summer. That’s your sense of urgency.” \n- Roy Williams on whether or not there’s a sense of urgency surrounding this season in light of the potential for tougher times ahead. \nStaff writer Stephen Schramm can be reached at schramms@fayobserver.com or at 486-3536.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:57:33.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
