The issue was discussed at an FA board meeting on Wednesday. \nAn FA statement said: \"In July, The FA board decided unanimously to support Michel Platini if he intended to stand for the presidency of FIFA. We did so because we thought he was an excellent president of UEFA and could bring those same leadership qualities to FIFA. We are still of that view. \n\"However, events of recent days have raised a number of issues which do need to be fully examined.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:42:43.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
