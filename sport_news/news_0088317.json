However, there’s still plenty to play for in this Week 7 match-up.\nKansas City will be tasked to shut down not Ben Roethlisberger, not Michael Vick but Landry Jones,who is making his first NFL start. The third year pro out of Oklahoma will have the talented Le'veon Bell and Antonio Brown at his arsenal at Arrowhead Stadium.\nOne of the biggest factors of the game will be whether or not the Chiefs can create turnovers off Jones. The run defense had no issues shutting down Adrian Peterson in Week 6 and should be up for the task against Bell. If they can limit Bell, the Steelers will count on Jones to take care of the ball and manage the game. Forcing a few early turnovers would change the course of the game.\nThe Chiefs can put themselves in a good position if they can apply pressure to Jones and force him into stressful situations and long downs. Opportunities like that create turnovers that the Chiefs will really need if they want to compete. Jones will be anxious to make a play and it’s up to the defense to be ready.\nOn offense, every facet of the game will play a vital role in how the other group succeeds. If Kansas City can run the ball well, that should open up play action for Alex Smith. If the offensive line can block then for Smith, that should open some holes for the backs to exploit.\nThe Steelers defense has been inconsistent at times and sits in the middle of the pack overall. Establishing the run early with Knile Davis and Charcandrick West will put the Steelers on their heals and open up the play book for Andy Reid.\nThe other area that needs to improve offensively would be Smith’s willingness to push the ball down the field. Even if the running game is not there, Smith can’t be tentative when airing it out against Pittsburgh. It’s the time of year when teams take chances and Smith needs to open the offense up to keep Pittsburgh reeling.\nMental toughness will be the final crucial area for this game, on both sides of the ball. For being one of the most talented teams going into the season, Kansas City has faltered and never quite recovered. It’s times like this when good coaches and good teams can put aside the past and focus on what’s ahead.\nThis includes limiting the costly mistakes. Last week against the Vikings, Kansas City had way too many penalties in crucial spots that really set them back. The team needs to keep their composure and make the other team beat them, not the other way around. West had the only turnover of the game with a fourth quarter fumble, but turnovers in those situations can’t happen, especially against the Steelers.\nWith a London match-up looming in the next week, this is a vital game for Kansas City if they want to gain any momentum going into the second half of the season.\nIt’s a winnable game for the Chiefs, but so have the last three, and they all resulted in losses. Win or lose, now is the time to see how mentally tough and aggressive the Chiefs can be.\nThe Chiefs are set to kickoff at noon Sunday from Arrowhead Stadium on KCTV5.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
