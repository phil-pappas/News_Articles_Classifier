Championship Series sent the Royals into the World Series, starting Tuesday night at home against the New York Mets. \nAfter the delay, Cain promptly worked a leadoff walk from closer Roberto Osuna, and Hosmer followed with a clean single that Bautista fielded down the right-field line. \nRather than hit the cutoff man, though, Bautista threw to second to keep Hosmer to a single. That gave the speedy Cain, running full speed the entire way, enough time to beat the relay throw from second base with a textbook slide that ignited a sellout crowd. \nDavis retired Josh Donaldson on a grounder with runners on second and third to end it. \nCheck back for more on this developing story. \nMets: Outfielder Yoenis Cespedes has received a cortisone injection in his sore left shoulder, and the team expects him to be ready for the World Series next week. \nCespedes left Wednesday night's N.L. Championship Series finale at Chicago in the second inning. The slugger had the injection on Thursday and was told not to participate in baseball activities for 24 hours, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said. Cespedes did not attend Friday's voluntary workout at Citi Field. Advertisement \nMets manager Terry Collins says: \"We've got it taken care of. The doctors, they said, look, he'll be OK, and so tomorrow we'll find out.\" \nCollins said he didn't ask how Cespedes got hurt. Hitting coach Kevin Long said Cespedes thought he did it doing push-ups. \"He didn't do it playing golf. He didn't have a bad sand shot or didn't get stuck in the side of a bunker,\" Collins said. \nMariners: Seattle hired former big league catcher Scott Servais as their manager Friday, giving the job to someone with ties to the new front office but no experience running a team. \nThe 48-year-old Servais replaces Lloyd McClendon, who was fired earlier this month after Seattle went 76-86. Servais will be formally introduced by the team next week. \nNew Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto made the announcement. Servais has worked the past five seasons as an assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Angels and worked alongside Dipoto for most of that time. Dipoto resigned as Angels GM on July 1. \nNot only did Dipoto and Servais work together with the Angels, they were teammates for one seasons in Colorado in 2000. \nServais spent time with the Giants, Houston and the Cubs during his playing career. \nSeattle also reportedly interviewed Angels' special assistant Tim Bogar, Tampa Bay third base coach Charlie Montoyo and former Boston catcher Jason Varitek for the managerial position. \nRed Sox: Ten weeks after being diagnosed with cancer, Boston manager John Farrell was given a clean bill of health by doctors and cleared to resume regular activities to the extent his body will allow. \n\"The news ... is a huge relief to me,\" Farrell, 53, said in a conference call with reporters on Friday, one day after the Red Sox announced that his cancer was in remission. \"It beat me up a little bit physically, but right now I'm feeling pretty darn good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:36:25.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
