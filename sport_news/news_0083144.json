The No. 14 Aggies remain undefeated after coming from behind to beat Arkansas in overtime last week at Arlington's AT&T Stadium.\nNow they'll meet in front of a crowd of more than 100,000 at Kyle Field, where A&M will try to make up for last season's 48-31 loss in Starkville, Miss, where the famed cowbells clanga-clanga-clanga-clanged all day long.\n\"I'm amazed they're picked last in our division, I don't see that,\" A&M coach Kevin Sumlin said. \"Basically as a team that's not getting the type of respect they should be getting, they're coming here to prove something.\"\nFirst-team All-SEC quarterback Dak Prescott powers MSU. The dual-threat force has been responsible for a school-record 81 touchdowns in his career (48 passing, 33 rushing). He hasn't thrown an interception this season, riding a streak that stretches 191 passes and 17 quarters.\n\"He's 220, 230, he gets bigger every year I see him,\" Sumlin said. \"He's patient. They run the power read. He'll hop and look and...you just hope he doesn't come popping out of there. He's a tough guy to tackle.\"\nIn MSU's 17-9 win over Auburn last week, the Bulldogs limited the Tigers to zero touchdowns in four red zone chances. The defense is allowing 14.8 points per game, though it hasn't yet fast a pass-first SEC opponent like A&M.\n\"For our guys that was a big game,\" MSU coach Dan Mullen said. \"I'm sure everyone wants to say that they're going to win the SEC West undefeated. That doesn't happen very often. Once you start hitting two losses, especially earlier in the season, it's harder to come back from. That win keeps you going in the right direction. Now obviously, we have another tough test this week.\"\nFor A&M, the still-in-progress defense under new coordinator John Chavis gave up over 200 yards rushing to Arkansas and had trouble getting the Razorbacks off the field. MSU has the fewest number of rushes in the SEC, though that approach could change Saturday against the Aggies.\nAnd A&M's offense, while it can be explosive, particularly when freshman Christian Kirk gets the ball from maturing quarterback Kyle Allen, has struggled getting touchdowns out of trips inside its opponents' 20-yard line. A&M hasn't reached the end zone nine times out of 24 trips to the red zone.\nA&M gets its first chance at an SEC win at the new Kyle Field. The Aggies haven't won a league game at home since beating MSU in November of 2013, after going 0-3 against league competition last season at Kyle. A victory would put A&M in excellent position heading into a bye week before hosting No. 13 Alabama and visiting No. 3 Ole Miss.\n\"Going to be a great atmosphere, 6:30 game, two Top 25 teams,\" Sumlin said. \"It's right in the wheelhouse for the 12th Man.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-10-03T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:43:02.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
