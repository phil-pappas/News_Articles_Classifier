Everyone wants to know the Royals' game plan for beating the New York Mets, but Yost is keeping his lips sealed.\nThere are no rules in Major League Baseball that say Yost has to announce the rotation, so he's not going to. The Mets announced their rotation after a workout at Citi Field on Saturday.\nWhen asked if he would reveal the pitching lining up, Yost was a little difficult.\n\"You have the rotation yet, Ned?\" one reporter asked.\n\"I do,\" Yost replied.\n\"Would you like to share it with us?\" he was asked.\n\"I will not. I'll talk about it tomorrow,\" Yost said.\n\"Is there a reason for that?\" another reporter asked.\n\"Because I want to wait until tomorrow,\" Yost replied.\n\"What are you waiting for?\" someone asked. \n\"Tomorrow,\" Yost said.\n\"What will happen tomorrow that will allow you to release this information?\" one reporter asked.\n\"I'm just being a little bit of a punk,\" Yost said.\nKansas City is the epicenter for the baseball world Monday because it is World Series Media Day at Kauffman Stadium.\nPlayers from both teams, including managers, will speak to reporters from across the country.\nRoyals players will start interviews about 1 p.m. before their 2 p.m. practice.\nThe Mets will take their turn about 3 p.m. followed by practice at 4 p.m.\nIt is back-to-back World Series trips for the Royals, but they haven't won a World Series since 1985. The Mets, however, are just as hungry. They haven't won a championship since 1986.\nYost says the playoff fight has been a tough one so far, and he doesn't expect it get any easier.\n\"This series has been a real dog fight against a great Houston team, phenomenal Toronto team, and we don't expect this to be any easier,\" he said. \"It is going to be tougher because the teams get better and better. But, I like the way we're playing. I like what we have going on ... we'll just go play the series.\"\nYost says his team has been watching video and going over the Mets defense and offense since they advanced on Friday. He's confident his team is ready.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
