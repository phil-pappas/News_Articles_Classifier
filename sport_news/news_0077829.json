He's tried to not get any of the verbiage confused with what his previous four teams or nine coordinators employed.\nBut Cassel has more than playcalls swirling in his head as he prepares for his first start with the Cowboys on Sunday against the New York Giants.\nCassel's wife, Lauren, gave birth Saturday to the couple's fourth child and second son, Clayton.\n\"My wife's been amazing, and I kind of slept in the other room the other night to get some rest,\" Cassel said. \"I wonder how long that's going to last before she rings in and makes me do the bottle feeding.\"\nWith a lot on his mind these days, Cassel is taking a simple approach in preparing for his first start with the Cowboys and throwing to new receivers at game speed.\n\"I tell them, 'You get open.' And then they tell me, 'Just throw me the ball.' So usually it works about like that,\" Cassel said. \"Hopefully, we simplify it rather than make it more complicated.\"\nAfter Brandon Weeden went 0-3 as the starter in place of the injured Tony Romo, the Cowboys have turned to Cassel because he's more experienced and could give them a better shot to open up their offense with throws down the field.\nWeeden mostly threw short passes in his three starts, following the game plan to be more conservative.\n\"You'll see more attempted plays from him than we got from Weeden,\" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said earlier in the week on KRLD-FM. \"And, so, you could have more bad plays. But you've got the chance to have some plays 20 yards or longer, which we call big plays generated by the offense.\"\nCowboys coach Jason Garrett said Wednesday it's not correct to say that Weeden alone prevented Dallas from making big plays on offense during his three starts.\n\"All of those things have everything to do with the entire offensive unit. To say it's about one player is inaccurate,\" Garrett said. \"We did some good things when Brandon was playing quarterback for us. We were able to move the ball. We were effective in some of the games he played. The idea of creating explosive plays and making that all about Matt Cassel, that's an inaccurate approach. We all have to do a better job of that.\"\nWeeden is 5-19 as a starter in the NFL and has lost 11 consecutive starts dating to his rookie season in 2012 with Cleveland.\nCassel is 34-38 as a starter. Cassel, 33, went 10-5 in 2008 for New England filling in for an injured Tom Brady.\n\"That was his first big opportunity to play, a big stage for him, and he handled it really well. And that allowed him to play well as a starter in opportunities after that,\" Garrett said. \"Any of those experiences are good. That's all part of who you are as a player as you come for this new opportunity. You bring those experiences to the table and hopefully that reflects in your play, and we're confident it will with Matt.\"\nGiants coach Tom Coughlin said Wednesday his club is preparing for Cassel's first start by reviewing Cassel's preseason games for Buffalo this year and even his starts in place of Brady in 2008.\n\"He turned in an outstanding year [in 2008],\" Coughlin said. \"Tall man, pocket passer, rhythm, does a nice job in there in terms of the rhythmic passing game, and distributes the ball well.\"\nCassel said he's always approached the game as if he's starting no matter where he is on the depth chart.\n\"I think that's why I had longevity in this league is that if you perceive yourself as somebody who's just in a backup role and happy to be there, then I don't think you ever strive to get better,\" Cassel said. \"You always have to push yourself. I think your mentality, even if you are in that backup role, has to be that you've got to prepare like a starter and be ready to go at any moment because your opportunity could come up.\"\nAnd it has for Cassel. He said he's ready.\n\"I feel good about it. I feel comfortable,\" Cassel said. \"My comfort level with the guys has been great. Last week I think with the bye week and having two extra days of practice was very helpful, actually getting in there and getting some rhythm with those guys. Now it's just about building each and every day leading up to the game.\n\"All my different situations and all my ups and down throughout my career have helped prepare me for this situation. I'll be ready to go come Sunday and I'll be excited. It'll be great to be in that Cowboys uniform and starting for them against the Giants.\"\nTwitter: @DMN_George\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nGeorge: In strange way, Tom Brady's 2008 injury could help Cowboys survive Romo-less stretch\nGeorge: The good and bad news about Matt Cassel replacing Weeden\nLaufenberg: Why Eli Manning might be losing sleep this week\nGeorge: Why trip to Ground Zero won't affect Cowboys' preparation for Giants\nWhat a collaboration between Cowboys, Nike will do to protect Dez Bryant on his return\nCowlishaw: A solution to nude NFL players on TV?
