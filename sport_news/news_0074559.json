He now has 138 career saves which is tied with former teammate Brad Sienkiewicz for the most in the program's D-1 era (2005-present). \"We had two great first half goals and with our possession in the first half we were really able to move the ball well with the group that was on the field ,\" said Head Coach . \"I'm pleased overall with the team and today's win puts us in a good position moving forward.\" Alex Morrell , who was integral in the team's Coaches vs. Cancer efforts this week, was credited with fourth assist of the year on the game's first goal. With possession of the ball and his back to his defender just outside the six yard box, he pass backwards to a wide open Kovacs for the score. Kovacs froze Stetson goalkeeper Paul Ladwig with a laser into the lower right corner of the net. Morrell moves into a tie for the team lead and now tied for second in the Atlantic Sun with four assists. The Osprey striker has 32 career points, moving him into sole possession of second place on the program's D-1 era list. In the 40 th minute freshman Josh Castellanos made a great play near the Osprey end line for the Osprey's second goal. From the near sideline he was able to clear past his defender while charging towards the net and crossed a pass to Garcia for the one-touch goal. Garcia became the 11 th different Osprey this season to record a goal. The Ospreys and Florida Gulf Coast University are the only two teams that have clinched postseason berths thus far. The Eagles are the league leaders with 10 points (3-0-1) with the Ospreys right behind them with seven (2-0-1). The men's soccer version of the River City Rumble will commence next Saturday across town. Game time is set for 7:00 p.m. at Southern Oak Stadium.
