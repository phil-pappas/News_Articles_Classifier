About 250 people attended.\nTickets were not required but participants were invited by about 20 civic groups who asked for RSVPs. Translation into Spanish was provided for audience members.\nDe Blasio has taken criticism for not having more face-to-face interactions with constituents.\nHis predecessors held town halls with some regularity. De Blasio also until recently rarely appeared on radio shows during which callers could ask him questions.\nThe de Blasio administration scheduled the forum to tout its housing policy and the newly passed rent freeze for rent-stabilized apartments.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:23:48.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
