The BSF claimed it had responded in equal measure to the shelling by the Pakistan Rangers. The guns fell silent on both sides around 5 am today, said panicky villagers of Mawa. They said half of the population in the area had shifted to their relatives’ houses in safer areas and those staying in the village anticipated fresh exchanges tonight. “We lodged a written protest with the Pakistan Rangers at the local level via the Octroi post in the RS Pura sector today. A letter of protest was handed over to them,” said RK Sharma, Inspector General (IG), BSF, Jammu Frontier. He said the Pakistan Rangers continued the vicious cycle of unprovoked and unwarranted firing. “Around 9.05 pm on Saturday, the Rangers again opened unprovoked firing that intermittently continued through the night and ended around 5 am today. A total of 14 BSF posts were affected in the firing. We responded in equal measure,” said the BSF IG. “They fired 82-mm, 81-mm and 51-mm mortars, prompting us to pay them back in the same coin,” said Sharma. “We have apprised the Deputy Commissioners of Samba, Kathua and Jammu of the prevailing situation and an advisory has also been issued wherein people have been asked to stay indoors after the sunset,” said Sharma. Though there was no loss of life to the security personnel, two civilians, Kailasho Devi (40) and her brother-in-law Pritam Chand (45), both of Mawa village, were injured. Kailasho Devi was hurt critically and one of her legs was nearly blown away after a shell exploded in her house around 9.45 pm on Saturday. Rabinder Rattanpal, Medical Superintendent, Government Medical College and Hospital, Jammu, said Kailasho Devi’s left leg had to be amputated below the knee. “She has been kept under observation at the ICU,” he added. Since Friday, Pakistan firing and shelling has left a labourer dead and seven civilians injured. Several cattle have also been killed. A police officer said the forward villages, including Mawa, Bainglar, Suchetgarh, Manguchak, Chachwal, Chilyari, Regal, Chakdruma, Khora, Bobbiyan, Muthi Chadu and Patti Meru, were targeted by the Pakistan Rangers. “We remained indoors as Pakistan rained mortars last night. But there is no guarantee of life because shells pierce through roofs and walls. We are just sitting ducks for Pakistan,” said Asha Rani of Mawa. Another resident, Puran Chand, said the border people should be moved to safety.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:04:20.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
