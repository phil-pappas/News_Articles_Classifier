Milne Field on Saturday was hardly a cause for celebration. \nThe Dolphins beat an NAIA team that was on a five-game losing streak and playing its No. 3 quarterback on the depth chart. And while JU started fast, it led by only two scores in the fourth quarter. \n“Give [Edward Waters] all the credit in the world. Their coach [Alvin Wyatt] had their team more ready to play than us,” Bell said. “They were zoned in. We sort of took a week off and that’s on me. \n“We got a win and it’s an ugly one. We didn’t get better this week and we’ve got to look at ourselves and admit that. We’ve now got to go five more weeks and get focused no matter who the opponent is.” \nSlideshow: Jacksonville University prevails over EWC 49-28 \nWith JU ineligible to play in the postseason due to Pioneer League sanctions, the Dolphins’ goal this season is to finish 11-0. JU (6-0) escaped with four close wins to open the season before coasting to a 27-point win over Stetson last week. \nQuarterback Kade Bell had 359 passing yards and matched his career high with six touchdowns. \nJU turned the first three EWC turnovers into touchdowns on Bell scoring passes to Jamal Adjamah (3 yards), Andy Jones (12 yards) and Ulysses Bryant (26 yards). \nBut it was EWC’s fourth turnover that may have been the most important. With just under 10 minutes left and EWC trailing 42-28, the Tigers (2-6) put together a seven-play, 86-yard drive and appeared to have a first-and-goal at the 2-yard line after a 10-yard completion to Chris Anthony. That’s when JU safety Terrance Bryant jarred the ball loose from Anthony and then recovered it in the end zone. Bryant gave credit to teammate DJ Howard for the turnover. \n“DJ came over and stripped the ball out,” Bryant said. “I saw the ball heading out of bounds so I jumped on it and grabbed it in the end zone before I stepped out.” \nEWC led for most of the first quarter after defensive back Shaquille Stoudemire stepped in front of a JU receiver in the end zone and sprinted 100 yards to the opposite end for a touchdown. Former Raines standout Ray Dukes, who rushed for 121 yards including a 76-yard jaunt, scored the Tigers’ second TD on a 6-yard run. \nTigers quarterback Taron Williams went 9-for-21 for 151 yards with one TD and two interceptions. \nBryant had 75 yards rushing and 119 receiving for JU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:14:44.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
