Put into bat, India were bundled in just 17.2 overs, to record their second-lowest total in T20I. Their lowest was 74 against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in February 2008.As India collapsed, fans vented their fury by throwing water bottles from the two-levels gallery three and four as it continued unabated in the innings break.Bottles are incidentally banned in most of the venues in India where water is supplied in pouches but an Odisha Cricket Association official said in Barabati Stadium the situation is different.\"We have banned small water bottles and water pouches which can travel more distance than a big size bottle which is not banned here,\" an OCA official told PTI.Thankfully the bottles did not invade the playing area and fell on the practice surface outside the fence near the dressing room and the play resumed after the scheduled break with police officials taking control of the situation.There were also repeated announcements from the OCA to pacify the spectators and the match began without any further interruption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:07:50.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
