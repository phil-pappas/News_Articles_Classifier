Receiver Griff Whalen wound up snapping the ball to safety Colt Anderson, who was immediately tackled for a 1-yard loss on fourth down at his own 35-yard line. Tom Brady took advantage of the short field and led the Patriots to the clinching touchdown. \n\"I'm not going to say that play changed the game,\" Anderson said. \"But it definitely had a big impact on the game.\" \nAnd now the ramifications will be felt. \nThe most immediate impact is that the division-leading Colts already have three more losses than the other three AFC division leaders — Cincinnati, Denver and New England — and have now given away the head-to-head tie-breaker chip to the Patriots, their bitter rival. That means instead of hosting the Pats (5-0), in a January rematch as the Colts had hoped, they'll like be playing on the road — if they make it that far. \nThen there's Pagano's status. \nThe man who turned down a contract extension during the offseason was more aggressive Sunday night and it nearly paid dividends twice. Indy turned a fourth-and-1 on the opening series into a touchdown and nearly recovered an onside kick after Mike Adams' interception return gave Indy a 14-10 lead in the second quarter. \nHis third major gamble, the fake punt, never had a chance. \nEven if the Colts had picked up the first down, it would have been nullified by an illegal formation penalty. \nAnderson said the Colts added the fake punt to their playbook last season after seeing the Patriots use it — before the league changed its rules about some strange-looking formations. It didn't help the mood when New England coach Bill Belichick said afterward: \"We expected this to be a gadget game.\" \nInside the locker room, players mostly toed the company line with one exception. \n\"It turned out to be one of the most failed fakes, probably of all-time,\" punter Pat McAfee said following the game. \nIt's a play that either needs to get fixed, or deleted, in the meetings leading up to Sunday's game against New Orleans (2-4). \nOr it could prove much more costly than just one more mark in the loss column. \n\"I didn't do a good enough job of teaching the thing, coaching the thing, getting the coaching points across and how we wanted the thing communicated and I've got to do better,\" Pagano said. \"That's not on them (Whalen and Anderson). That's on me.\" \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:34:22.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
