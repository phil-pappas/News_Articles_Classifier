Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015 8:19 am Tigers seeking to go 3-0 in district play By JORDAN MOSS Tribune sports writer dailytribune.net | 0 comments The Mount Pleasant Tigers have a chance to remain in control of their playoff destiny on Friday night. The Tigers will host the Hallsville Bobcats this week looking to improve to 3-0 in District 15-5A play. For Mount Pleasant getting another district win is important if the Tigers hope to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2012. Especially with three of the Tigers last four games being against powerhouses Longview, Marshall and Texas High. The Mount Pleasant offense has been riding the success of running back Travion Holloman in the previous two weeks victories. Holloman continued his success last week going for 415 yards and four scores on 45 carries. The Tigers are still searching for ways to take some of the offensive load off of Holloman’s shoulders. Using the way teams are keying on Holloman to set up the play action passing game is a possibility the Tigers could explore. Holloman is all over everyone in the district radar by now. That means the passing game will have to become more prevalent if the Tigers offensive success is going to continue. Defensively the Tigers may have given up 30 points last week to Sulphur Springs but the difference in play from the first to the second half was night and day. Mount Pleasant gave up 21 points in the first half before buckling down and holding Sulphur Springs to just nine points in the last two quarters. The Bobcat offensive was held to 145 yards of total offense by Texas High last week. Hallsville managed just 75 yards on 35 rushing attempts. Hallsville played much better on defense holding Texas High to only 39 passing yards and 2-of-10 completions. With Hallsville coming in losers of their last three games and 0-2 in district play the Bobcats will be hungry to get their season back on track. Mount Pleasant will have its hands full as the Tigers try to keep their win streak alive. Tigers head coach Corey Homer feels the come from behind win last week was a building block for his team. “We were down 21-7 at the half and fought through many obstacles and adversities to win the game at the end,” Homer said. “I believe this was a great lesson for our kids in perseverance and believing in their coaches and each other.” As for tonight’s game, Homer isn’t putting much stock in the recent Hallsville losing streak, noting that the Bobcats will be well prepared. “We are expecting another great match up this week,” Homer said. They (Hallsville) have a strong team of consistency. Coach Plunk has a great staff and he has created a great system in Hallsville. They have strong special teams, offense and defense. Their offensive and defensive lines are big and physical as well as their skill kids. They have a strong team.” Mount Pleasant and Hallsville will kick-off tonight at 7:30 p.m. from Sam Parker Field. Now let’s take a look at the rest of the District 15-5A competition tonight. Longview (4-1, 2-0) at Marshall (5-0, 2-0) The Lobos and the Mavericks are set for a huge showdown tonight. Both teams enter the game undefeated in district play with Marshall having not lost a game all year. This game could very well determine who will win District 15-5A. Expect a lot of scoring as both teams have high-powered offenses. Marshall scraped by Pine Tree with a late touchdown last week while Longview blew out Greenville 51-0. Look for Longview to take the W in a close one. Pine Tree (1-4, 0-2) at Texas High (4-1, 2-0) The Pirates nearly pulled the upset on Marshall last Friday night. Pine Tree will face another tough test this week traveling to face a Texas High team that pulled away from Hallsville for a 21-10 victory last week. Texas High will likely emerge victorious. Pine Tree will likely experience a letdown after the close emotional loss to Marshall, and the Texas High defense that stifled Hallsville last week should perform at a high level again. Sulphur Springs (0-5, 0-2) at Greenville (1-4, 0-2) Something’s got to give in a battle of teams that are winless in district play. A false start on an extra point attempt led to a miss that cost Sulphur Springs the chance to tie the game late against Mount Pleasant. Greenville meanwhile was overpowered by Longview. For Greenville it’s still all about running back Carandal Hale on offense. Hale has racked up big yards all season but the rest of the offense has done little. Sulphur Springs is more balanced and the likely winner of tonight’s game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:15:09.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
