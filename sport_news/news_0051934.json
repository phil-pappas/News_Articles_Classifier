We were seeing the ball, we were creating chances, we were dangerous. It was just kind of a situation where there were kind of some soft goals, maybe a bit unlucky, but I like the energy that we were playing with.” \nRockhurst staked an early lead with a goal from Cole McLagan, who scored when a ball the Jays cleared from a Rockhurst teammate fell right to him. \nThe goal came in the middle of an early-game stretch in which the Hawklets notched four shots on goal in a span of just over four minutes. Jays goalie Zach Brooks also cleared a dangerous ball from the top of the box during the attack. \n“There’s always going to be stretches when Rockhurst has the ball, and they’re going to make you look kind of bad,” Horn said, “but I thought all and all, we were really good” on defense. \nThe Jays then settled in, controlling possession and receiving a string of corner kicks. Overall, the Jays kicked nine corners to Rockhurst’s three. \nThe Hawklets extended their lead, however, when Ignacio Sainz de Aja sent Keaton Schieffer a bouncing feed Schieffer reached just moments before Brooks, sending the ball over the goalie’s head and into the net. \nThe play came right after a Jefferson City shot went wide, and the Jays weren’t able to get their defense reset in time. \n“You pressure and you cover,” Horn said. “There was pressure (on offense), but the cover didn’t happen, and then the kid was able to get in behind. So defensively I think those are things we can work on going into the playoffs.” \nThe Jays entered halftime down two goals, but were still able to control the ball on Rockhurst’s side of the field. It paid off 12 minutes into the half when Skylar Richardson made two defenders miss and touched the ball to Carron across the middle. Carron was unable to get a shot off initially, but Eric Ortiz kept the ball in play and returned it to Carron, who sent it into the left corner of the net. \n“I thought he really showed some fight and showed some aggressiveness at trying to go to goal,” Horn said of Carron. “You need that from him when he’s your leading goal scorer.” \nThe Jays’ best shot at tying the game with less than 9 minutes to play. Richardson took the ball on a long run and perfectly played the ball ahead to Colton Acock, who soundly struck a one-timer that went wide of the net, bringing the crowd to its feet. \n“(Acock) maybe hasn’t seen the points from a scoring-goals perspective, but he was really dangerous tonight,” Horn said. “He got off a couple of great shots, and we need that from him going into the playoffs.” \nWith the win, Rockhurst improves to 15-6-2. \n“It’s a tough game to schedule on your last game of the regular season, right before you go into the playoffs,” Horn said. “You’d kind of like to build confidence and that type of stuff, and so Rockhurst is a tough one, but at the same time it definitely tells you where you’re at.” \nThe Jays (12-8-3) begin district play at 7 p.m. Monday at Rock Bridge. The Jays beat the Bruins 2-0 earlier this month. In September, Jefferson City beat Battle 5-0 and lost 2-1 to Hickman in penalty kicks. \n“If you think about it, as good as Rockhurst is, they would be a three seed in our district,” Horn said, “because they lost to Hickman and Rock Bridge. I mean, the district’s tough. It’s highly competitive. It’ll be really difficult.” \nJefferson City and Rockhurst played to a scoreless draw in the JV game. It was the Jays’ 12th shutout of the year, and they finish the season 13-1-1. \nFollow News Tribune sports reporter Brandon Foster (@BFoster91) on Twitter for updates during local games. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:53:21.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
