It was enormous. \n\"Arsene Wenger won't admit it, but Cech gives so much reassurance to everyone when he's making save after save. Arsenal can make mistakes and he'll still keep them in the game. That's what he did, and they ended up winning 2-0.\" \nAlthough he singled out Cech for individual praise, Nicholas was impressed with the way Arsenal's defensive shape stifled Bayern, who had won 11 games on the bounce coming into this game. \nHe said: \"Bayern probably had four times as many passes and four times as many chances, but Arsenal had the better chances. It was unusual for Arsenal, although they did it at Man City last season. \n\"You wonder why sometimes they can't put a solid defensive display and get the balance right more often. They were superb tonight.\" \nA modest Cech said Arsenal's collective team effort rather than his saves was key to beating Bayern, but warned more hard work lies ahead if the Gunners are to reach the knockout stages of the Champions League.
