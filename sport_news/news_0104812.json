He's a breakdown of how South Alabama has fared in the various phases of the game thus far: \nOffense \nUAB transfer Cody Clements has stepped right in and given the Jaguars a productive passing attack, averaging 234 yards a game with 10 touchdown passes. On the negative side, he's thrown nine interceptions, including a couple of late-game killers. \nNow that all four are in the lineup together, Josh Magee, D.J. Vinson, Marvin Shinn and Danny Woodson give the Jaguars an experienced and productive receiver corps. Tight Gerald Everett is probably the best player on the team and one of the best at his position in the country. \nThe running game has not fared as well, ranking near the bottom of the Sun Belt at just 119.4 yards per game. Xavier Johnson has been solid, but was slowed against Arkansas State by a heel injury. \nThe offensive line has also been a mixed bag, at times struggling mightily to protect Clements. Right guard Cameron Blankenship, arguable the Jaguars' best player up front, is out 2-3 weeks following knee surgery . \nRELATED: South Alabama looking to bounce back after fourth-quarter collapse against Arkansas State \nDefense \nThe statistics are skewed a bit by blowout losses against Nebraska and North Carolina State, but the Jaguars have been mostly good defensively, particularly considering all the new faces on that side of the ball. \nThe linebacker corps, led by top tackler Blake Dees, UAB transfer Kalen Jackson and freshman Bull Barge, has been excellent. Jackson in particular has been a revelation at Will linebacker, despite weighing just 200 pounds. \nThe Jaguars have struggled on the defensive line, both in getting pressure on the quarterback (just six sacks this season) and in being pushed around by physical running games. Jack linebacker Akeem Lewis missed two games with a toe injury, but returned to play well against Arkansas State before a targeting ejection. \nThe secondary has performed admirably at times, but continues to be victimized by the big play. True freshman Jalen Thompson looks like a future standout at cornerback, however. \nSpecial teams \nAleem Sunanon has been largely reliable, hitting all 15 extra points and making 9 of 11 field goals (though he did miss a 28-yarder against Troy). He's even filled in a bit at punter. \nBeyond Sunanon, the kicking game has been a disaster for the Jaguars. Punter Brandon McKee has averaged just 39.5 yards, and was pulled late in the Arkansas State game in favor of Sunanon. \nThe Jaguars' return teams have not been good, averaging only 20.3 yards on kickoffs and an almost impossibly puny 2.0 yards on punts. Kickoff coverage has been decent, but punt coverage — opponents average 16.2 yards per return — has also been shaky. \nRemaining schedule \nThe Jaguars should be favored to win their next two games, at Texas State Oct. 24 and at home against Idaho Nov. 7. A Nov. 12 Thursday night home game against Louisiana-Lafayette could be the key to the season. \nWin those three, and South Alabama would be in position to top last year's victory total (6) when it travels to Georgia State on Nov. 21. The Jaguars are likely to be underdogs against Georgia Southern Nov. 28 and Appalachian State Dec. 5. \nBottom line \nWhile the Jaguars missed a golden opportunity to jump into the Sun Belt race when it blew a fourth-quarter lead against Arkansas State Tuesday night, the season is not off the rails by any means. The next three weeks will tell the tale of the 2015 South Alabama football team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:25:17.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
