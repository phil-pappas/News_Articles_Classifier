(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) Weekly fantasy is about matchups. That’s what truly differentiates it from season-long fantasy football . The idea that you need to “start your studs” isn’t relevant because you have access to ALL of the studs. Let’s dive into the matchups you should keep in mind when deciding which Week 6 studs will be in your winning lineup.\nAdChoices 1. Russell Wilson vs. Carolina Panthers Sacking the quarterback is how most FanDuel defensive points are scored. Unfortunately for Russell Wilson, the Seahawks have allowed 22 sacks so far this season — tied with the Kansas City Chiefs for the most in the league. Frankly, you can point directly to the misguided offseason trade to get Jimmy Graham as the reason for these sacks and overall poor offensive line play.\nBefore you try defending Graham’s pass-catching abilities and consider plugging him in this week, just know the Panthers give up the absolute least FanDuel points to opposing tight ends. Basically, this is a lose-lose situation for Seattle and a win-win for the Panthers. It’s almost impossible to justify starting Russell Wilson at $8,000. Unless Seattle can come up with a way to fix that offensive line by Sunday, this could be a long game for Wilson and Co.\n2. Pierre Garcon (or DeSean Jackson) vs. Darrelle Revis So far this season, DeSean Jackson has been sidelined due to a nagging hamstring injury. Considering he’s a speedster and downfield threat, getting the necessary burst while nursing that kind of ailment is borderline impossible. In his absence, Pierre Garcon has stepped into a larger role and will probably draw coverage from Darrelle Revis this Sunday — unless Jackson makes his triumphant return.\nJackson is more electric, so from a fan’s perspective, the Jackson/Revis matchup would be more exciting. The two have played against each other twice in the past. While Revis was in his first round as a Jet in 2011, he held Jackson to two receptions and 28 yards. In 2013, when Revis moonlighted as a Buc, Jackson caught six passes for 64 yards and two touchdowns. To be fair, Pro Football Focus noted the CB only allowed two catches for six yards, but I’m sure Jackson still feels pretty good about that outing.\nIf he comes back and Revis covers him, that will open up Garcon, making him a decent FanDuel option in Week 6 to the tune of $6,000. If Revis is on Garcon, he’ll have no chance at a big day and should be avoided in all contest types. Jackson only costs $5,700, but it’s risky to play a guy in his first game back from a soft tissue injury in a tough matchup.\n3. Teddy Bridgewater vs. Kansas City Chiefs So far this season, the Chiefs have given up the absolute most points to opposing quarterbacks and wide receivers. Unfortunately, Teddy Bridgewater and his receiving corps have struggled mightily in 2015, with the second-year signal-caller averaging just 11.72 FanDuel points per game.\nMinnesota is coming back from a bye, so perhaps they used the time off to get things together. You can plug him in for Week 6 hoping he will play well enough to eclipse his modest $6,600 price tag. Another interesting option is Mike Wallace. While he’s only averaging 9.8 FanDuel points per game, his best game of the season was right before the bye, catching eight passes for 83 yards and a touchdown against a stout Denver defense. There’s some promise there, and at only $5,400, Wallace is the kind of risk you want to take.\n4. Josh McCown vs. Denver Broncos Contrarian picks are fun and can win you money on FanDuel. This week, there will be a handful of people wanting to push McCown as the sleeper pick against Denver. It’s no secret that the Broncos defense has dominated both the run and pass in 2015, but they lost DeMarcus Ware to a back injury last week.\nHe’ll be back in Week 8, but McCown won’t have to face Ware’s pass rush. Shaqil Barrett, who already has two sacks this year, will fill in, so this isn’t a terrible downgrade.\nMcCown has been electric over the last few weeks and looked like a Hall of Famer in Week 5, throwing for 457 yards and two touchdowns. Don’t chase points, though. This is not the week to plug in McCown, even at his $7,000 price tag. If anyone can expose the Browns offense, it’s the Denver Broncos.\n5. Denver Running Backs vs. Cleveland Browns The golden rule in the 2015 season has been to play running backs facing the Browns since they’re surrendering a league-high 147 rushing yards per game to opposing backs. All of that changes this week because they face the Broncos.\nDenver has no run game — like, at all. Their lead back on the season is Ronnie Hillman, but he’s only scored 36 FanDuel points throughout all of 2015, which is an average of 7.2 points per game. Many thought C.J. Anderson had a chance to be the top running back in the league this year, but he’s only averaging 5.18 points per game.\nSome in the Denver market who want to throw the baby out with the bath water and start Juwan Thompson to see if he can give this anemic running game a spark. If you want to go with someone from this group because you can’t imagine ignoring this matchup, then you’ll have to go with Hillman. He at least rushed for over 100 yards in Week 4 against Minnesota. It’s still risky, but at $6,400 you can justify throwing a dart.\nKnowing an opponent can help open your eyes to options you otherwise would not have considered. Keep your head on a swivel throughout the week. Things change, people get injured and life happens. Make sure you have all of the information before you submit that final lineup. Have a great week and good luck!\nThe post 5 NFL Matchups You Should be Watching During Week 6 appeared first on FanDuel Insider .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.fanduel.com/insider/2015/10/14/5-nfl-matchups-you-should-be-watching-during-week-6/", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://www.fanduel.com/fantasy-football"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:44:50.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
