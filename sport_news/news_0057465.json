By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nA few weeks into the high school football season, I wrote about all of the area teams and how they all held promise to be playoff teams. Related Links Oesterle: An excitement-filled prep football weekend \nLooks like I spoke way too soon. \nAs it stands, Morris, at 3-5, and Seneca, at 2-6, have both been eliminated from the playoffs. Both Coal City and Minooka, each with 4-4 records, have a chance to reach the playoffs with wins this week. Coal City plays a Seneca team that has been racked with injuries at key positions, so the Coalers’ prospects look pretty good. \nThe downside to that is that they will enter the playoffs with a 5-4 record and be on the road, most likely against an undefeated or one-loss team. Not an easy task. \nMinooka, meanwhile, has the unenviable assignment of playing Plainfield North and needing a win. The Tigers handed 7-1 DeKalb its only loss of the season and have won their past four heading into Friday night. Minooka, meanwhile, has seen a 4-1 mark turn into 4-4 with losses in their past three games. Even with a win, the Indians may not have enough playoff points (opponent wins) to qualify. \nIt may turn out to be one of the shortest football postseasons in recent memory in the area. \nThat doesn’t mean that all is lost for fans of area sports. The Morris and Coal City tennis teams have entries in this weekend’s state tennis meet, and there could be some volleyball teams that make some noise. \nAlso, Morris’ boys soccer team is trying for its fifth straight regional title Saturday at the Class 2A LaSalle-Peru Regional against Geneseo at 3 p.m. \nPlus, not far down the road is a football program that local fans may want to adopt and follow. \nI am talking about Wilmington, the defending Class 3A state champion. The Wildcats are currently undefeated, ranked No. 2 in 3A by the AP in the most recent poll, and play fellow 8-0 team Manteno, ranked No. 5 in 4A, on Friday night. \nFor those who don’t know, Morris graduate Jeff Reents is the head coach at Wilmington, as he has been for the past 21 years. He missed the playoffs his first two seasons, but hasn’t since. \nThis season will be the 20th in a row that will see Reents and the WIldcats in the playoffs. Also on the sidelines will be a familiar Morris face in Andy Peterson. \nThe town is wild about its Wildcats, and if you decide to make a trip over there, get there early. There is a new high school, but the games are still played at the old school, which doesn’t have the greatest parking in the world. \nBut I promise you the pregame show alone is worth the trip and the price of admission. And if you are a fan of line up, hit each other for four quarters and see who comes out on top football, then a Wilmington game is for you. \nYes, I heard about the recent dustup about the Redskins nickname at the recent Morris High School board meeting. \nI honestly believe that there will come a time when the state will mandate that Morris drops the name, but, until then, I am fairly confident it will stay. Right now, I would think that the state has bigger issues to address. \nI don’t know anyone who thinks of being a Morris Redskin as a negative thing. An overwhelming majority of graduates of Morris Community High School are proud to be Redskins. They are part of that community. Yes, it would be the same if the school founders way back when had picked another name, but they didn’t. \nIt also starts us down a slippery slope. Where does it stop? Would it just be the five schools that use Redskins as a nickname that would be forced to change, or would the 22 Indians and 31 Warriors have to as well? Or the three Braves, three Blackhawks and one each of Chiefs, Comanches, Tribe, Kahoks, Mohawks, Saukees and Illinieks? \nSeems to me like that would eventually wipe out any memory of Native Americans on Illinois soil, and I don’t think that’s what we’re after, either. \nThose of us who have walked those halls are Redskins, and it is a bond that ties us all together. \nThe name can, and – most likely – will change. \nThe bond won’t.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:47:03.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
