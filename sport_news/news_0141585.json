He's expected to be fully recovered by the spring. \nMainieri says the injury will require about six weeks of recovery. \nBefore fall practice began Sunday, Mainieri said Jordan and junior college transfer Bryce Adams were the leading contenders at first base. LSU needs to replace every infielder from last year's team, and Mainieri said losing Jordan for the fall may slightly change how he handles the infield competition. \nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:49:46.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
