The baby's parents, Kristen Bury and Joseph Walsh, are in jail in South Carolina. A missing Florida baby may have been found dead in the woods, as his drugged-up parents remain locked up in South Carolina.\nThe Sarasota County Sheriff's office said on Thursday they found an infant's body believed to be Chance Walsh, an 11-week-old baby who disappeared on Oct. 4. Police searched across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina for Chance, and found him buried in the wooded area of North Port on Thursday after getting a tip.\n\"We received information directing us to a location on Elliot Court and have confirmed our worst fears,\" Sheriff Tom Knight said in a statement.\nSarasota Co. Sheriff's Office Kristen Bury and Joseph Walsh have been arrested and charged with neglect after their baby went missing. Medical examiners are working to confirm the identity of the infant, but police said they are confident the body belongs to Chance.\nThe body was found about 13 miles away from where Chance lived, according to reports. It was unclear why the infant was found buried so far away from his home while his parents were in South Carolina.\nHis grandmother reported the infant missing after the family didn't see the baby for almost a month, cops said.\nSarasota Co. Sheriff's Office Police found Chance Walsh buried in a wooded area in Florida. Kristen Bury and Joseph Walsh, the infant's mother and father, switched their stories several times when trying to cover up the disappearance. First they told relatives they gave Chance away at a Georgia hotel, then they said he died in a car crash in South Carolina, but then said Chance was fine after the crash, police said.\nThe parents, who are known drug addicts, have been arrested in the past for drugs, burglary and theft, according to their criminal record. They're now locked up on child neglect charges.\nInvestigators searched their apartment on Oct. 5 and found blood on a bed and in a bathroom, according to arrest documents.\nBury \"despised\" Chance, because of her previous child who died, she told her stepmother, according to her affidavit.\n\"I loved that baby. I can't take care of him,\" she said, referring to Chance. She told her stepmother \"it was better\" that Chance was gone, because she would have hurt him.\nA woman who stayed at a Georgia Red Carpet Inn, where the two parents were, said Bury tried selling baby clothes and told people her baby died three weeks ago.\nAuthorities are still trying to figure out the mystery behind Chance's disappearance and possible death.\nang@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Florida infant missing as drug user parents change story Fla. mom who killed 3 kids is 'pissed' police let her live Mom arrested after grandpa and child found dead in Fla. shed", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:41:38.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
