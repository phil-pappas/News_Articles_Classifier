Marchand connected with Weise's elbow and was very slow to get up. He made his way back to the bench with a little help from teammate Colin Miller and needed some help to get back to the dressing room.\n\"March suffered a concussion,\" said B's coach Claude Julien. \"We're going about it with the league's protocal (on concussions). His return will be dictated by how quickly he recovers. We have no timetable for him.\"\nIn Marchand's absence, Brett Connolly moved onto right wing of Patrice Bergeron’s line with Loui Eriksson moving over to the left.\nThe No. 3 line had Ryan Spooner between Chris Kelly and Jimmy Hayes. David Krejci remained with Matt Beleskey and David Pastrnak.\nDefenseman Zdeno Chara (upper-body injury) was back in practice and appears to be close to ready. The struggling Bruins host the Tampa Bay Lightning tomorrow afternoon.\n\"I would say questionable,\" said Julien of Chara. \"We haven't made that decision yet. It's going to be done at some point with the medical staff, and see if it warrants a go or not. If it doesn't, it's probably going to be a few more days. It's not just pain, but more the risk that's at stake. He's very tolerant when it comes to pain; it's a matter of whether he's good to go and what's the risk factor?\"\nDefenseman Matt Irwin, who's had an inauspicious start with his new team — a minus-5 in the first two games — was not on the ice at today's practice and Julien revealed afterwards that he had been placed on waivers. \" Matt's been put on waivers,\" said Julien. \"There's nothing more, as far as no decisions will be made until we see if he clears or not.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:52:37.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
