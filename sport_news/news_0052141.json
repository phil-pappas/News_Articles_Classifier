(Photo: Kirk Irwin, Getty Images)\n1 CONNECT 1 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Mats Zuccarello had two goals and the New York Rangers scored three times in a little more than a minute in the third period to rally to a 4-2 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Friday night.\nBrandon Saad, the Blue Jackets' blockbuster acquisition in the offseason, scored on a power play at 16:10 of the third to give the Blue Jackets a 2-1 lead in their season opener.\nBut after a Columbus turnover, Oscar Lindberg netted a low shot for his second goal in as many games to tie it at 2.\nJust 17 seconds later, Kevin Hayes made it 3-2 with a shot from the right corner along the end line that found its way past Sergei Bobrovsky, who finished with 21 stops.\nZuccarello capped the scoring from the right circle a minute later.\nHenrik Lundqvist finished with 21 saves.\nThe Rangers played another strong road game, coming off a 3-2 win in their season opener Wednesday over the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks.\nCam Atkinson also scored for the Blue Jackets, who are looking to avoid the slow starts that have put them in deep holes the past four seasons. Even a franchise-best 12-0-1 points streak to finish last season wasn’t enough to get them into the playoffs.\nZuccarello started the scoring late in a hard-hitting, fast-paced first period. Gregory Campbell couldn’t reach a short pass from David Savard deep in the Columbus end. Zuccarello scooped up the loose puck near the crease and flipped a backhand shot past Bobrovsky.\nUSA TODAY\nMike Babcock returns to Detroit: Eight reasons Red Wings will be fine without him\nAtkinson pulled Columbus even at the midpoint of the second period. He scored on a breakaway on a nifty move for his first goal on a long pass from Brandon Dubinsky from his knees.\nNOTES: The teams play again Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. Alain Vigneault won his 100th game as the Rangers coach. …Columbus C Alexander Wennberg left the game with an upper-body injury in the first period. …Former Blue Jacket Rick Nash was booed every time he touched the puck. …The Blue Jackets played their first regular season game with a captain since 2011. Nick Foligno was given the ‘C’ in the offseason …Rangers D Kevin Klein played in his 500th career game. …Columbus is 6-7-2 all-time in season openers.\nPHOTOS: October's stars: Best performances of the month\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn October's NHL stars: Best performances of the month Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
