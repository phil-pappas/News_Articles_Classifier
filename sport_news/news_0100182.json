And last night the B’s were indeed quite impressive on the attack, producing more than enough quality scoring chances to score a pile of goals — but were stymied by their own misplays and by Jets goaltender Ondrej Pavelec (29 saves).\nThe offense looked good. But with all the talk about that phase of the game, the B’s forgot about the defensive side.\nIt wasn’t just about the defensemen, either: Again and again, Bruins forwards were flying out of the defensive zone early — racing up ice before the back guys had cleared the puck out of the zone.\n“There was maybe a lack of respect on the other side of the game,” said B’s coach Claude Julien. “And that’s where it ended up costing us. We might have gotten a little excited here about our offense and forgot about the other part of our game.\n“Whether is was coverages, layers, decisions with the puck or D-zone awareness, we made all of those mistakes — which resulted in goals-against.”\nOf course, it’s hardly irrelevant that Julien’s club was without injured veteran defensemen Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg. But even when those guys are back in the lineup, the team has made a major commitment to a crop of new blueliners. And Game 1 did not go well for most of them.\nGoalie Tuukka Rask was the victim of several of the mistakes.\n“We obviously created a lot of chances, but also gave up some chances and rushes,” said Rask. “First game of the year, that kind of thing might happen. Obviously, going forward that kind of thing cannot happen if we want to win games.\n“I thought we looked great in the first period. We created a ton of chances and didn’t give up barely anything. And then as the game went on we got a little sloppier and gave them some chances.”\nRask wasn’t about to blame the disappointing night on Chara’s absence.\n“You know what? It’s not just him being out of the lineup,” said the goalie. “Guys are going to get hurt. We have to have guys step up, and we have to respect our game plan defensively, (and) offensively. And we’ll be OK. When we don’t, these kind of things can happen.\n“Overall, the offense we created was great. When we just balance it out a bit with the defense, I think it’s going to be good.”\nIt some ways, this kind of flawed performance might have been somewhat predictable with all the emphasis on faster breakouts and transitions into the attack. It’s what management wanted. But the game plan has to be built, first and foremost, on sound team defense. It’s just hard to believe that Julien and his staff instructed guys to fly out of the zone before the Bruins defensemen even have full control of the puck.\n“No, definitely not,” Rask said. “We want to attack together and have layers. Especially in the second period (when the Jets scored three goals, off turnovers by Joe Morrow and Matt Irwin, and a defensive breakdown by Irwin) we tended to cheat a little bit offensively.\n“When the gap becomes too big, if we make one bad play, very, very shortly after that it’s going to be a shot on goal against us. That happened quite often. You started cheating offensively and one mistake leads to another very quickly. We did that a couple of times.”\nThis game should prove valuable as a teaching tool — a reminder that, yes, it’s great fun to fly up the ice like the Tampa Bay Lightning. As long as they don’t forget to defend like the Boston Bruins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:05:26.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
