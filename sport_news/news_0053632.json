The Bulldogs are showing their best this season, and teams are taking notice. Now, University has to continue on this path during the last stretch of the regular season and carry it into the postseason. The Bulldogs are in second place in the Class 3A Patriot League with eight league matches left. Then, they will end the regular season with a tournament at 5A Legend. UH is 8-1 in league play and 10-1 overall after sweeping Patriot foe Valley on Tuesday, 25-16, 25-8 and 25-22. On Tuesday, Brown said the Bulldogs’ defense looks good, but there are still some areas they need to work on. “We don’t have a game for the rest of the week, so we will have good solid practices,” she said. “We will get in, work on those areas and then be ready to go for three games next week.” Having just one loss in league play gives University a slight advantage over third-place Platte Valley (8-3, 13-4). These two teams meet at 6:30 tonight in Kersey. The Bulldogs will go on the road at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday for a match at Sterling and finish the week hosting Frontier Academy at 6:30 p.m. Thursday. But this past week, UH played three tough teams in a short timespan, which Brown said is great preparation for the final stretch. “It’s great preparation to get us to see where we stand and to see the areas that we need to improve on,” she said. “The last three teams that we played really identified some of our weaknesses. We’re going to go work hard in practices this week and address those weaknesses and just work to get better in each of those areas.” The rest of the way, the ‘Dogs probably have two more matches floating in the back of their minds. In a little over a week, UH will host 2A powerhouse Resurrection Christian (8-0 2A District 7, 13-1 overall). In the conference finale, University will host two-time defending champion Eaton (11-0 Patriot, 17-0) at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 29. Both of those matches could be factors when it comes to state seeding. University hasn’t made it past pool play at the state tournament since 2010. The Bulldogs will get an added boost this week as junior outside hitter Katie Potter will be back in the lineup. While she was gone, a few younger girls stepped up and made University that much stronger. “We have great production from our younger kids, and they’ve done a great job,” Brown said. “And that’s allowed us to establish a deep bench. So, it’s going to be good competition over the next couple weeks to see who’s going to win out those starting positions … and see what we can do on our side. “We’ll challenge each other every day in practice and that’s going to make us a better team because of it.” Kayla Cornett covers Greeley schools sports for The Tribune.
