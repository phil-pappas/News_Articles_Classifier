With all four of Nebraska's losses having come on the opponent's final offensive play, each in the last few seconds or overtime, the Cornhuskers' first-year coach was asked Monday what he would like to see change the second half of the season. He responded, \"a 59-minute game.\" The Huskers (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) should expect another full 60 minutes of competitive football Saturday at Minnesota (4-2, 1-1). The Gophers have beaten Nebraska two straight years, including 28-24 last season in Lincoln after the Huskers fumbled inside the Minnesota 5-yard line with just over a minute left.
