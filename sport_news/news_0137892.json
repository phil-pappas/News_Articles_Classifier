(AP Photo/Ron Jenkins) \nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Trevone Boykin threw five touchdown passes, including four to freshman KaVontae Turpin, and No. 4 TCU rode a 30-point first quarter to a 50-7 rout of Texas on Saturday. \nJosh Doctson broke the TCU record for receiving TDs with a pair of scores as the Horned Frogs (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) won their 13th straight game, second nationally to defending champion Ohio State, which took a 17-game streak into its game at Indiana. \nThe Longhorns (1-4, 0-2), plagued by special teams mistakes for the third straight game, scored a late touchdown to avoid matching the second-worst shutout loss in school history — 50-0 to Oklahoma 107 years ago. They are off to their worst start since going 1-9 in 1956. \nTCU beat Texas in consecutive years for the first time since 1958-59, outscoring the Longhorns 98-17. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball@ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:52:24.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
