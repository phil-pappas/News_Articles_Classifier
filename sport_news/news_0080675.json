The election will take place in two phases, concluding in early December.\nPresident Abdel Fattah el-Sissi called on Egyptians to vote in a televised speech Saturday.\n\"Line up in front of polling stations and plant with your votes the hope for a bright tomorrow for our new Egypt,\" he said.\nVoting will go forward in Egypt under heavy security, in light of regular militant attacks since Morsi's ouster. At least 185,000 military troops will secure the election in the first phase, MENA reported. Interior Ministry spokesman Abu Bakr Abdel-Karim says they will be joined by 180,000 police.\nFew candidates have broad recognition or clear platforms, and most have a pro-government bent.\nThe vote will mark the final step in what has been billed as a transition to democracy. But critics say the next legislature is likely to be a rubber-stamp body that further solidifies the power of el-Sissi, a former general who led Morsi's overthrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:04:09.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
