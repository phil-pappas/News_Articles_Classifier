Sportsnaut 1 hr ago Rachel Wold © Stacy Revere/Getty Images Christine Michael of the Dallas Cowboys participates in warmups prior to a game against the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on October 4, 2015 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Dallas Cowboys have been on a three-game losing streak since Tony Romo became injured, and they have apparently started to clean house over their bye week.\nAdChoices Along with an overhaul at the backup quarterback position that swaps out a failing Brandon Weeden for Matt Cassel, it appears the Cowboys are going to get running back Christine Michael more involved in the team’s offense.\nGary Brown, asked about C-Mike's comfort level: \"I think he's where he needs to be, and we want to take the reins off him and let him rock.\"\n— David Helman (@HelmanDC) October 15, 2015\nMichael arrived in Dallas after spending two seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. When given the limited opportunity to play, Michael rushed for an average of 4.9 yards per carry. While it is uncertain as to whether Randle will remain the team’s starter, Michael, who is much larger than Randle and Darren McFadden could present more of a challenge to opposing defenses.\nThus far this season the Cowboys run game has not been very impactful, having only totaled only 531 yards and five touchdowns.\nMichael, who has never been given an opportunity to start because he played backup to Marshawn Lynch, drew only positive comments by Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett (via ESPN):\n“He’s quick. He’s explosive. I think he’s proven to be a good runner in college (and) when he’s had opportunities in the NFL. Again, we just want to get him into the mix. We’ll keep giving Joe opportunities. We’ll keep giving Darren opportunities. He’s worthy of a chance to play a little bit more.”\nWhile this sounds like a step in the right direction for a struggling Dallas Cowboys offense, this isn’t exactly the news fantasy football owners want to hear who are considering picking up Michael off the waiver wire.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/HelmanDC/status/654727888382464000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/HelmanDC/status/654727888382464000", "http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4746249/cowboys-ready-to-take-reins-off-christine-michael", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:46:38.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
