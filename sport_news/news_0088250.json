(AP) - A New Hampshire man whose daughter is now identified as the victim of a 3-decade-old Arizona killing says he still has questions about what happened to her.\nAuthorities in Tucson say Brenda Gerow (jeh-ROH'), of Nashua, was the woman found slain in 1981 near the Pima County Fairgrounds. Her body was exhumed in 2012 and investigators used her skull to reconstruct her face and identify her.\nSpeaking by telephone through an interpreter for people who are hearing impaired, William Gerow said Wednesday he is \"blown over\" by his daughter's death and doesn't know why she was killed.\nBrenda Gerow was about 20 when she left New Hampshire with John Kalhauser, who is currently imprisoned for the murder of his estranged wife.\nPolice say they are investigating the link between Kalhauser and Gerow.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:01:56.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
