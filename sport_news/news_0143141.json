Edmonton secured a home playoff game with the victory although both teams were already assured playoff berths heading into the game. Calgary had already secured a home playoff matchup while both teams have three games to play in the regular season.\nThe Eskimos take the season series between the provincial rivals with a 2-1 record, which is the tiebreaker should both clubs have the same record at the regular season’s conclusion.\nThe team that finishes first in the division hosts the division final and has a bye week before that game.\nThe Stampeders suffered their first loss in eight home games this season and their three-game winning streak came to an end. The Eskimos have won five in a row for the first time since 2011 when they opened 5-0.\nKenny Stafford had a touchdown catch for the Eskimos with Sean Whyte kicking two field goals, a convert and a pair of punt singles in the low-scoring affair.\nEric Rogers caught a touchdown pass for Calgary. Running back Jon Cornish added a two-point convert. Rob Maver booted three punt singles and had one negated because of a Stampeder penalty.\nEskimos quarterback Mike Reilly completed 29 of 40 passes for 264 yards and a touchdown. Stampeder starter Bo Levi Mitchell was 17-for-30 in passing for 230 yards and a touchdown throw.\nEdmonton improved to 9-1 when holding opponents to 19 points or less\nThe Stampeders marching into Edmonton territory late in the fourth quarter, Mitchell was intercepted by Cauchy Muamba on a throw intended for Marquay McDaniel with a minute and a half remaining in the game.\nMaver’s 64-yard punt single was the lone point of the third quarter, but Whyte replied with one from 50 yards at 1:36 of the fourth to restore a four-point cushion for Edmonton.\nTrailing 14-1 with just 35 total yards on offence late in the second quarter, Calgary came to life with nine points in the last two minutes of the half.\nMitchell capped a five-play, 65-yard drive with a 30-yard touchdown throw to Rogers in the end zone. Cornish produced the two-point convert on a one-yard plunge at 13:32. Maver added a 78-yard punt single.\nOn the final play of the half, Reilly was intercepted by former Eskimo Brandon McDonald airmailing to Derel Walker in the end zone.\nWhyte kicked a 43-yard field goal for Edmonton at 12:38 of the second quarter.\nDefensive back John Ogo picked off Mitchell for his fifth pick this season and gave the Esks the ball on Calgary’s 42-yard line.\nThe visitors parlayed the turnover into a touchdown with Stafford fighting off Stampeder safety Jamar Wall in the end zone for a 33-yard catch at 6:42.\nAfter a 58-yard punt single from Maver early in the first quarter, Whyte put the visitors up 3-1 with a 30-yard field goal at 10:50. Whyte’s 57-yard single at 4:32 of the second quarter made it 4-1 for the Esks.\nMore on thestar.com\nAustralia survives Wales in tryless match, avoids South Africa\nScotland edges Samoa to reach Rugby World Cup quarter-finals", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:09:48.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
