Young, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE East Lansing — Jalen Watts-Jackson has gobs of new fans this week.\nOne of the biggest might be his own teammate at Michigan State.\nOffensive lineman Brian Allen said Thursday night on Mark Dantonio’s weekly radio show that he was responsible for the pivotal sack of Connor Cook that stalled what seemed to be the Spartans’ last drive.\n“I’m sure I was getting you guys a little frustrated,” Allen said, to the MSU fans at Dantonio’s radio show at an East Lansing bar.\n“I just wanted to make it a little more interesting.”\nMichigan State was at Michigan’s 36 with a fresh set of downs, and more than 2 minutes left.\nThen Cook was sacked for a loss of 9 yards, forcing Michigan State to throw, and deep. Cook threw three straight incomplete passes, forcing the Spartans to punt and hope for a miracle.\nAnd that’s what they got when, with 10 seconds left, Michigan punter Blake O’Neill fumbled the ball into Watts-Jackson’s hands, and he scampered 38 yards for a stunning 27-23 Michigan State victory.\nAllen saw the play from the sidelines.\n“At the end of the game, I was taking a knee, kind of disappointed,” Allen said. “I saw the 10 seconds, next to Coach (offensive line coach Mark) Staten. It still doesn’t seem real to me. It seems like a dream, that it actually happened.”\ntpaul@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tonypaul1984", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:22:39.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
