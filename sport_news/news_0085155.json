They kept us in the game.\"\nThe Sky View defense — led by lineman Colton Durrant's three sacks, a safety, a tipped field goal and a blocked punt — finished off the Mustangs to record its second shutout of the season.\n  \"I think our defense is the most underrated defense in the state,\" Durrant said. \"People don't realize how good our defense is because our offense is so potent. We showed tonight we could do it on both sides of the ball.\"\nThe Bobcats' offense scratched together just over 100 yards in the first half, but Durrant's safety gave Sky View a 2-0 lead.\nMidway through the third quarter, after back-to-back punts from the SV offense, the Mustangs set up to punt on a fourth-and-1.\nAgain, Durrant came through, blocking the punt and setting up the offense on their own 49.\n\"Colton Durrant's an amazing kid,\" Sky View coach Craig Anhder said. \"He finds ways to make plays. I just can't say enough good about [our defense]. Can't say enough good about Colton Durrant.\"\nBeach hit Breygan Holbrook for a 20-yard pass that Holbrook wrestled away from Mountain Crest's Payton Thomas to set up a successful 29-yard field goal from Kyler Erickson.\nThe Mustangs got three more tries in the last eight minutes of the game to mount another of their late-game comebacks.\nBut a play after the Mustangs crossed the midfield line with 45 seconds to play, a botched snap sent the ball squirting past quarterback Tanner Schwab. Max Christensen dove on the ball and came out of the pile holding it for all the Sky View fans to see.\n\"I didn't play good all night long, and then my teammates put me in a situation to make that last play,\" Christensen said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:29:03.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
