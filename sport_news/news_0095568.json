Tight ends coach Larry Scott will take over as interim head coach, as the Hurricanes try to save their season and start yet another process of trying to reclaim lost prominence. \n\"Making a change midseason in any athletic program is something I prefer not to do, as I believe coaching evaluations should take place after a season concludes,\" said Miami athletic director Blake James, who told Golden of the decision Sunday night. \"However, in this instance, all of our interests are best served by moving forward and looking ahead, not behind.\" \nGolden went 32-25 with the Hurricanes and 17-18 in Atlantic Coast Conference play, his entire stint marred by an NCAA investigation and subsequent fallout caused by things that happened before he arrived in Coral Gables. His last game with Miami (4-3, 1-2) was a 58-0 loss Saturday to then-No. 6 Clemson, a result that had fans booing from the stands and calling for his departure -- as many angrily had for some time. Central Florida: After one of the worst starts in program history, George O'Leary is retiring as UCF's coach, effective immediately, the school announced. It comes a day after the Knights dropped to 0-8 with a 59-10 loss to Houston, the worst home defeat in school history. Quarterbacks coach Danny Barrett has been named interim coach. Advertisement \nO'Leary, 69, agreed to a contract extension in 2014 on the heels of a program-best 12-win season and Fiesta Bowl victory. \n\"In an effort to allow UCF to accelerate its search for my successor and clarify the facts regarding my future plans, I am retiring effective immediately,\" O'Leary said in a statement. AP poll: Stanford moved up and Cal moved out of The Associated Press' Top 25 poll. The Cardinal jumped up two spots to No. 8 after beating Washington 31-14 Saturday night. The Bears fell from 20th to unranked after losing 40-24 at UCLA on Thursday. \nAnother Pac-12 team took an even steeper fall than Cal's. Utah (6-1) dropped from third to 13th after suffering its first loss, 42-24 to unranked USC. \nOhio State (8-0) strengthened its season-long hold on the top spot, adding 11 first-place votes in Sunday's balloting after rolling over Rutgers. \nBaylor (7-0) remained at No. 2 but lost five first-place votes for a total of seven. Clemson (7-0) climbed three spots to No. 3 and has six first-place votes. \nFlorida State (6-1) didn't last long in the top 10, falling eight spots to No. 17. \nThe Seminoles were on the short end of the season's second bizarre special teams ending, losing to Georgia Tech 22-16 after Lance Austin scooped up a blocked field goal and returned it 78 yards for a touchdown on the game's final play. Baylor: Playoff hopeful Baylor is facing a potentially huge loss after staying undefeated, with quarterback Seth Russell set to see a specialist for a fractured bone in his neck. The extent of Russell's injury won't be known until after that visit early this week, but the second-ranked Bears (7-0) will almost certainly be without the top-rated FBS passer for at least some time. Russell got hurt in the Bears' 45-27 victory over Iowa State on Saturday. \nHighly touted freshman Jarrett Stidham would take over for Russell as starter. Arkansas: Coach Bret Bielema said running back Rawleigh Williams had successful neck surgery after the Razorbacks' four-overtime win over Auburn on Saturday. Williams was injured during a run in the third quarter of the 54-46 win, after which he was taken from the field on a stretcher. He had his face mask grabbed on the play before taking another hit from an Auburn player.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:41:11.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
