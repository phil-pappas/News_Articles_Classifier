Tori is awesome,\" said Wasatch coach Dawain Wheatley. \"She doesn't have height, but she has intelligence and she plays like a shortstop. She catches the short hops, leaps and gets the high ones to punch away. She'll dive on the ground. She was all over and making those plays.\" \nAfter knocking off three-time state champion Bonneville 1-0 in extra time and traditional power Alta by the same score, the Wasps are headed to the state semifinals Tuesday at 1:15 p.m. at Juan Diego High against Skyline, which defeated Woods Cross 5-4 in a shootout after finishing two extra-time periods tied at 1-1. \n\"It's huge,\" said Bills, who also made 12 saves against the Lakers. \"We knew that we could take this five minutes at a time, and we had the ability to beat them. We came out, gave it all we got, and here we are.\" \nThe Hawks entered the game with the pedigree, having won nine of their last 11 games, and immediately put Bills and the Wasatch defense under duress with three shots in the opening five minutes. \nBut the senior who also stands out in basketball and softball held off the onslaught and made it matter midway through the first half.

Allred/Deseret News) \nFellows latched onto the end of a long ball that bypassed the Alta midfield, dribbled through three defenders, then met a charging Alta goalkeeper near the top of the box. \nRather than panic, the junior deftly dribbled around the keeper and slotted home a goal on an empty net. \nWasatch, despite being outshot 10-1 in the first half, scored all the goals it would need to advance to its first state semifinal since moving to 4A's Region 8 in 2014. The Hawks outshot Wasatch 16-4 on the game. \nBut Fellows only needed one crack. \n\"She just doesn't quit,\" Wheatley said of Fellows. \"We tease her all the time about touching the ball with body part. She had the patience to wait (for the goalkeeper to come out). Melissa just gets after it with everything she's got. \n\"We got the ball into a dangerous spot. (Fellows) ran through, was patient, and tucked it away.\" \nBills got her money's worth of saves in the final 10 minutes. The senior stuck a paw down with six minutes to go to push a shot from point-blank range just over the bar for a corner kick, and center backs Whitley Sargent and Sienna Wagstaff did the rest. \n\"Whitley Sargent is the best marking defender in the state, and I don't know why BYU won't take her,\" Wheatley said. \"But Sienna is the glue in the back. She doesn't panic, she talks, she takes care of things. Our defense is awesome.\" \nThe duo defended four second-half corner kicks and another free kick from the corner by clearing the ball out of danger before the Hawks could latch on for a shot, making Bills' 12th shutout of the year that much easier. \n\"At the beginning of the game, I knew I needed to focus, warm up and give it all I got,\" Bills said. \"I gave it all I got, and here we are.\" \nAlta was riding a three-game winning streak that included a 7-1 win over Olympus in the first round of the playoffs. But Wasatch, despite losing the region finale 3-0 at Salem Hills, came into the game with plenty of confidence. \nThey'll take that same confidence into next week's semifinals. \n\"There is not a greater community in this state than the Heber Valley,\" Wheatley said. \"The kids are wonderful, I love them, and everyone is just fabulous. They do what you ask them to do.\" \nTimpanogos 2, East 0 — At East, Shaylie Weenig and Jadie Christenson scored a goal each on either side of halftime to help the Timberwolves blank the Leopards. \nCarly Nelson earned the shutout in goal for Timpanogos, and also registered an assist in the playoff win. \nTimpanogos will play Box Elder at 11 a.m. Tuesday at Juan Diego High. \nBox Elder 2, Timpview 2 — At Timpview, the Bees prevailed in a shootout, 4-2, to advance to the 4A semifinals. \nKamryn Worthington and Mica Schoenrock each scored a goal for Timpview.

(Chris Samuels/Deseret News) Class 5A \nWeber 2, Lehi 0 — At Weber, Ellie Maughan and Ryan Virgil scored a goal in each half to help the Wildcats roll past the Pioneers and advance to the 5A semifinals. \nWeber will play Lone Peak at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Juan Diego High. \nLone Peak 2, Mountain Crest 0 — At Lone Peak, Cameron Tucker and Mary Clark each scored a goal to lead the Knights to the shutout victory over the Mustangs. \nBrianne Allen earned the shutout for Lone Peak. \nAlso in 5A, top-ranked Davis edged American Fork 2-1 in extra time to set up a semifinal Tuesday at 3:45 p.m. against Fremont. The Silver Wolves rolled by Herriman 6-2 in the other quarterfinal.
