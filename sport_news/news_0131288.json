He was unable to win the starting job as a rookie, and when he did come in late in the year, he was not only dreadful, but wildly unprepared.\n\nThe latest from SportsLine Will the Ravens' pride show up in the desert? \n\nAfter an offseason stint in rehab, Manziel came back to the Browns and had supposedly turned things around. Everyone with the team sounded much more impressed with both his work ethic and his play when compared to last year's disaster. He still couldn't beat out Josh McCown for the starting job, but he actually performed admirably when asked to fill in during Weeks 1 and 2 when McCown got hurt.\nMcCown took the job right back once he was healthy, though, and Manziel went back to just being the backup. That is, until this Sunday, when McCown suffered a shoulder injury and Manziel had to fill in once again. He went 4 of 5 for 29 yards on his lone drive of the day, and is in line to be the starter next week if McCown can't go.\nThere are a lot of people around the league that don't necessarily have a lot of confidence in Manziel's ability to be an NFL-caliber quarterback, and he probably knows that.\n\"I hope I still have some love in the city of Cleveland,'' Manziel said, per Cleveland.com . \"I hope people haven't given up on me. I'm trying to do the right things on the field, just trying to keep my head down and just keep plugging and keep pushing and keep trying to gain back what I felt I lost last year in a rough rookie season. That's all I'm really doing right now ... making the most of my opportunities when I do get in there.''\nAs for whether he's prepared to take over as the starter if McCown indeed can't make it back from his injury, Manziel was unequivocal. \"Yeah, 100 percent,'' he said. \"Obviously earlier in the year I got a chance to start, come in whenever Josh was out and did some good things and then since then haven't gotten a chance to get back on the field, but obviously I've been continuing to shore up everything, continuing to learn.\n\"If Josh goes out or he's out for an extended period of time, I think I'll be able to step in and try to make something happen.''\nOf course, whether or not he starts may not even be up to Manziel. He was involved in a domestic incident with his girlfriend about two weeks ago and reportedly told police that he had been drinking before the incident as well. Manziel could potentially face discipline under the personal conduct policy for the incident, but he declined to say whether an interview with investigators has been scheduled just yet.\n\"Obviously it's a situation that's ongoing with the league,'' Manziel said. \"If the NFL does reach out to me, I'll fully cooperate with anything they ask me. I'm not shying away from that. I cooperated fully with Avon, I cooperated fully with everybody in the Browns and anybody that's asked me anything. We'll see in the upcoming weeks.''\nIn the meantime, a Change.org petition has been launched to get Manziel suspended until the investigation is complete. As of this writing, it has just over 46,000 supporters.\n\nJohnny Manziel is ready to start if needed.
