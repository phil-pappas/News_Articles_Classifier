After a Saturday full of action and overreaction, we're here to help you figure out what's hot, what's not and what's true as the season enters its second half. \nSaturday saw two top-10 teams fall from the ranks of the unbeaten, and Week 8 included losses by four ranked teams. Here are five story lines to know (and, in some cases, debunk): \nThis week's Snap Judgments: 1. Maybe Utah won't make the Playoff after all. \nThis is, admittedly, a knee-jerk reaction to a bad, lopsided loss at USC . But suddenly there seem to be holes (and uneven play at the quarterback position) that could be exposed against other Pac-12 foes moving forward. Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \nIf the Utes play like they did Saturday night, can they beat UCLA? We don't think so. And they'd have to beat the Bruins to get to the Pac-12 title game and, in turn, have a shot to make the four-team College Football Playoff. \nWe knew entering the season that there was a good chance the Pac-12 champion this year would have at least one loss ... but now there are no unbeaten teams left in the conference, and there are stark differences in how and when each Playoff contender suffered its loss(es). For example, Stanford's — in Week 1 to Northwestern — doesn't seem so bad, considering how well the Cardinal have played since and the kind of season the Wildcats have had. \nUtah's loss to USC amid off-field turmoil and an interim coach — well, that's something different. This one could be more debilitating in the long run, particularly if there's any hangover effect or if Utah continues to turn the ball over. 2. With J.T. Barrett at the helm, Ohio State finally looks like the Ohio State team we thought we'd see this year. \nWhich is to say, it looks like the Ohio State team that won a national championship last season. And we aren't surprised. We've believed Barrett should be starting at quarterback all along, but better late than never. He was dynamic on the ground, and he threw a pretty ball in the Buckeyes' demolition of Rutgers on Saturday. He threw for three touchdowns and ran for two more, accounting for 324 total yards of offense before exiting the game with a 49-0 lead. College football's Week 8 winners and losers \nBarrett's skill set has always seemed like a better fit than Cardale Jones' for what Urban Meyer wants this offense to do, and that became obvious by halftime on Saturday. Put simply, this team's ceiling is higher with the ball in Barrett's hands. 3. Miami is a mess. \nAfter suffering the worst loss of its program's 90-year history — 58-0 to Clemson at home — it's becoming more and more obvious that this program is not trending in the direction its fans demand. We've seen the \"Fire Al Golden\" messages flown over stadiums in recent weeks, and we've also watched the product on the field disintegrate into something some of Miami's most prominent former players disdain . It's ugly; there's no other way to put it. And it now just appears to be a matter of when, not if athletic director Blake James makes a change. \nMiami Hurricanes head coach Al Golden looks on from the sideline after Clemson Tigers scored a touchdown.

Georgia Tech became the latest team to win with a wild, wacky and magical special teams play. \nThe Yellow Jackets stunned Florida State , blocking Seminoles kicker Roberto Aguayo's 56-yard field goal attempt and running it back for the winning score as time expired. A week after Michigan's botched punt with 10 seconds remaining led to Michigan State's stunning victory, we got to see another ending that rendered us speechless. This one handed Florida State its first loss of the season, and its first loss to an ACC opponent since October 6, 2012 — which is an insane streak, actually. \nBut if a streak like that is to end (and all streaks end eventually), what a way to go out: The kicker who had never missed a fourth quarter kick in his college career gets blocked. In general, special teams are creating extra special moments this season, and we're totally OK with that. 5. Ole Miss is the toughest team in the country to figure out. \nThis is the same team that beat Alabama but got blitzed by Florida? The same squad that lost to Memphis a week ago and, on Saturday, utterly dominated Texas A&M? If any team has been more Jekyll and Hyde than the Rebels, please let us know. What's amazing about this rollercoaster of a season is that Ole Miss could very well still win the SEC West. (We know Memphis will be rooting for the Rebs to do just that, by the way.) What a time to be alive . \nHOW THE TOP 25 FARED IN WEEK 8 :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:32:08.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
