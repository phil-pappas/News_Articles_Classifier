A field of 51 teams from eight states qualified to compete in this conference championship. The winning East Hall duo said that they concentrated on fishing blowdowns for the majority of the day with a shaky-head rig with a green-pumpkin Reaction Innovations Flirt Worm to catch the majority of their fish. Fifteen of the 45 teams that entered brought five-bass limits to the scale. The Vikings representatives beat out teams from Hazel Green High School (Ala.), who finished second with a five bass haul of 12-2. Evans High was third (11-15); Berkeley High School, (Moncks Corner, S.C., 11-7); Abbeville High School (S.C., 11-7). Each of the top five qualified National Championship. \nComplete results and photos from the event can be found at HighSchoolFishing.org. \nThe 2015 TBF/FLW High School Fishing Southeastern Conference Championship was a two-person (team) event for students in grades 7-12.
