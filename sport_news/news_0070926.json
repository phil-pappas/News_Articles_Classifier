The Aussie specialises in handmade oil paintings and spends most of his time illustrating the biggest names on the planet.\nNow Jarryd Hayne sits among that list of names after Dickens painted the 27-year-old in his San Francisco 49ers gear. Speaking to news.com.au, Dickens said he thinks Hayne will one day reach the heights of some of his more well-known subjects.\n“Some of my artworks are commissioned, but Jarryd was definitely a personal piece as the bloke is massively inspiring to me,” said Dickens.\n“He’s clearly on his way to legend status.\n“I reckon Jarryd can achieve anything he puts his mind to, he’s definitely got the drive and talent to chase down his dreams.”\nDickens’ work started to gain more exposure when professional wrestler-cum-movie star Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, noticed he was the subject of one of his portraits and gave a shout-out to the painter via his Instagram account.\nINSTAGRAM “Dope oil work done by @LargeDrew. Artist is very talented and also struggling so I’m happy to shine some light on his work. Thank you man for your amazing work and keep on keeping on,” said Johnson.\nGolf legend Greg Norman was another of Dickens’ subjects to take an interest in his work, thanking him for painting him and his dog in September.\n@SharkGregNorman Thanks so much, no problem at all. Let me know anytime if you would like the original, more than happy to give it to you.\n— Andrew Dickens (@DickensArt) September 25, 2015 Dickens has also received support on social media from the likes of NBA stars Andre Drummond, John Wall and Larry Sanders, as well as from Hulk Hogan and Sir Paul McCartney.\nDickens said he’s hopeful Hayne will also take notice of his work in the future.\n“I’m hoping Jarryd can do the same some day,” he said.\nINSTAGRAM INSTAGRAM INSTAGRAM INSTAGRAM INSTAGRAM Remarkably, as an AFL supporter, Dickens didn’t know who Hayne was until he joined the NFL. When asked how he decided who to paint, Dickens said it came down to people he admired for making tough decisions and chasing their dreams.\n“(I paint) anyone who has made that decision to break away from the norm, found their talent, and chased down their dreams as if it were just as important to them as oxygen, food, and water,” said Dickens.\n“To see people who have clearly achieved it all, and remain absolutely humble at the top is far and away the most inspiring thing to me.”\nHayne in action for the 49ers.
