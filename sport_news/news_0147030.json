And yet, there are examples of traditional values and generosity, which tend to encourage, rather than discourage, us.\nOne example is the honor and respect and gratitude with which we as citizens and local communities treat our service members and their families. It’s a quantum improvement over what was occurring in the 1960s.\nLast year, one small community expanded an existing program of offering free accommodations to military service members and their families for a weekend in proximity to Veterans’ Day. That community was Tybee Island. Fifty service members, active and former, and their families were provided free (except for cleaning fees) accommodation on Tybee Island at various rental properties for a three-night weekend. There was a parade in honor of the military and family friendly activities at the American Legion on Tybee.\nThis year, Tybee plans to expand the celebration. Tybee vacation rental agencies and homeowners hope to provide at least 100 service members, active and former, and their families with no-cost (this year, cleaning fees will be waived) accommodations on Tybee during the Salute to Heroes event Nov. 13-15. The weekend will include a parade and family friendly activities at the American Legion Post 154 on Nov. 14.\nBusinesses will offer discounts to the military during that weekend. All this is offered by the citizens, property owners and businesses of Tybee along with the American Legion Post 154 to honor our service members and their families and as a token of Tybee’s gratitude, for their service and sacrifices made on behalf of our nation.\nTybee solicits military service members, active and former, and their families to apply for no-cost accommodations during that weekend, Tybee’s Salute to Heroes 2015, so that they may enjoy a relaxing stay at the beach and be honored for their service. Applications may be submitted through the website www.visittybee.com . Click on View All Events, then click on Tybee Salutes Heroes and print out, complete and submit the application form by Oct. 30.\nOrganizations and individuals wishing to participate in the parade at no cost are invited to go to the same website, www.visittybee.com , and complete and submit the parade entry form by Nov. 2.\nWe believe that our service members and their families deserve to be honored by Tybee Island and receive our gratitude.\nDEMETRIOS G TSOULOS, M.D.\nSavannah\nWhat do you plan to do to help Savannah’s needy?\nThe headlines are constant and the complaints countless: We have a crime issue in our city. Crime is clearly linked to poverty in numerous studies.\nHowever, aside from our Facebooking, Twittering and attributing to the next person in line, many fail to take any real action as we still suffer from the following misconception and respective justification: The poor are poor because they’re lazy, and because they’re lazy, they should not eat.\nAnyone well versed in education or psychology understands Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. If individuals’ basic needs for life are not met, they are unable to progress beyond the level of seeking out whatever means necessary to attain them or even use higher level thinking to break the cycle they’re experiencing.\nThough many may believe those in poverty are living off the government, driving a Mercedes, chatting on the nicest phone and making out with an easy life, this perception is unfounded. As a community we must look for opportunities to spread the wealth we have, though it be small.\nThough such will not solve our problem overnight, if we would look for outlets to serve our fellow needy humans whether by tutoring in an inner city school, sponsoring produce boxes for those without or simply by channeling overabundance into our poorest communities, there would be an eventual impact. I’m proud to say there are many with willing hearts starting this movement in our community.\nTo the naysayers, I ask: What have you actively done for the poorest Savannahians around you? And now, in turn, what do you plan to do?\nLAUREN EVANS\nSavannah\nTEA Party to Buddy Carter: Defund Planned Parenthood\nThe people of the Savannah TEA Party request U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter that he sign the Mulvaney letter, thereby committing to vote against any continuing resolution that allows tax dollars to be sent to Planned Parenthood. Those funds would instead be redirected to comprehensive women’s health centers permanently.\nBy adjusting the Medicaid language in a continuing resolution we can stop the money from flowing toward Planned Parenthood. While the stand alone measure that you support would defund Planned Parenthood if it passed, with no pressure on the Senate or the president, they are free to ignore the effort.\nWe also don’t understand why an investigation is even necessary in order to defund the organization. The already established general knowledge of Planned Parenthood with the addition of the graphic videos should be enough proof.\nIn addition, if like the last shutdown, it lasts about 16 days, the investigation is not going to start and conclude in that amount of time, so the fact that the Department of Justice is closed during a potential shutdown now doesn’t mean the investigation would be totally compromised.\nAs for the history of shifting the narrative, during the last shutdown the media focused on the government closing, but it also put Obamacare front and center. During this time the Democrats saw their approval ratings drop and the following election was a huge Republican victory because they focused on stopping Obamacare.\nA government funding fight brings the reason for that fight front and center. That would force Senate Democrats and the president to defend those videos in the midst of rejecting a government funding bill — an argument we know they cannot win. We will await Mr. Carter’s response to our request. We also thank him for his time, consideration and service.\nJEANNE SEAVER & DEBORAH BRODERICK\nChairman/President\nLegislative Committee\nSavannah TEA Party\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:03:26.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
