Over the last few decades, it is now possible to observe clearly an overlap between ‘Peugeot’ and ‘pujo’. Two homophones that sound similar, ‘Peugeot’ is a sleek French car while ‘pujo’ is a Bengali enunciation of the sharad Navaratri puja. ‘Pujo’ in New Delhi is launched with the kind of fanfare that was once associated with car launches. There are gorgeously attired women, usually escorted by anxious looking men to pandal extravaganzas where fairs with rock bands, multiple food joints and sales outlets mill with visitors. Everyone gazes upon the most incredible tableaus with goddesses and invoke blessings. Prizes were awarded for the two best pandals in New Delhi and Kolkata this year. An oversized pandal was declared out of bounds for visitors due to security concerns. The conspicuous display and consumption notwithstanding, Navaratri is a serious event which prescribes fasting and minimal eating to mark the onset of soul-searching. Navaratri (Sanskrit, nine nights, implies a plural, but takes a singular verb) is celebrated all over India. Emphasising the feminine principle, with three nights each allotted to Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati. This period of private fasting and prayer was meant to detox, and energise the body, mind and spirit. Navaratri is scheduled four times in the annual calendar, but ‘Vasantha Navaratri’, marking the beginning of the year in March and April, and ‘Sharad Navaratri’ (September, October), announcing the coming of winter, are most well known. The Garba in Gujarat and the Golu (dolls arranged on steps) in Tamil Nadu are other popular events celebrating Navaratri. Another happy, symbolic gesture perhaps, but far more pleasant than the grim reality dogging little girls and young women in newsprint, is the celebration of ‘kanjak’ where little girls in the neighbourhood are invited by older women, propitiated, fed puris, chanas and halwa, and given gifts, which they carry back home. The festival is about the resurgence of the feminine principle. Associated with Shakti and with the moon, these celebrations extend late into the evenings. The 10th day, celebrated as Vijayadashami, is also known as Dashera. This is a reference to Ravana and also to the 10 bad qualities that must be overcome through abstinence and introspection. Navaratri invokes a cosmic symbolism where energy is celebrated in female form. It becomes necessary to examine recent proclamations announcing that the cow is our mother. The cow is a prolific creature, conferring enormous benefits to humans. Cows provide milk for their calves in the manner of all mammals. Proverbially, humans steal milk from the mouth of calves and consume it themselves. If giving birth and providing nurture are venerated in culture, this yardstick of evaluation must extend to females of all species. Else, cows will remain ‘kamdhenus’ (fulfillers of desire), symbols of exploitation and excuses for communal conflagrations. This transformative ‘mathan’ (churning of the body, mind and spirit) is an essential Navaratri requirement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:29:01.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
