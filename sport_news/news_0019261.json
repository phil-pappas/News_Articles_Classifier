According to jail records, Coleman was booked into King County Jail in Seattle early Thursday, oct. 15, 2015, and bail was denied. (AP/Elaine Thompson) \nSEATTLE -- Authorities said Friday that they'll wait until an investigation is complete before deciding whether to file criminal charges against Seattle Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman, who was arrested following a crash that injured a man. \nColeman is being investigated for vehicular assault and felony hit-and-run. \nDan Donohoe, a spokesman for the King County prosecutor, said in a statement that Coleman was being released from jail and that he wouldn't appear in court. The investigation into Wednesday's incident, including full toxicology test results, was expected to take at least a month. \nColeman was booked into King County Jail early Thursday and initially denied bail. Police officers in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue said they arrested him because he left the scene of the two-car accident Wednesday evening. \nSteve Hayne, one of Coleman's lawyers, has said Coleman was \"in shock\" and didn't flee or go far from the scene. \nColeman's agents said in a statement \"it seems Derrick may have fallen asleep while driving home from a Seahawks' facility.\" \nWitnesses said Coleman's truck was speeding through a 35 mph zone when it rear-ended a Honda Civic, said Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett. After Coleman was helped from his vehicle, witnesses said, he left. \nOfficers found Coleman two blocks from the crash within 10 minutes based on the descriptions from witnesses. Coleman reported no injuries, while the driver of the other vehicle was taken to a hospital with serious, non-life-threatening injuries. The Seattle Seahawks have suspended Derrick Coleman indefinitely pending further information. â€” Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) October 15, 2015 \nColeman is in his fourth season with the Seahawks, who suspended him following his arrest. He was on the practice squad in 2012 before making the 53-man roster in 2013. Coleman missed 11 games and the playoffs last season because of a broken foot. \nColeman is legally deaf and his football success has made him an inspirational figure. He has been featured in TV commercials and has written a book that was released this year.
