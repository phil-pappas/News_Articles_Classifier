(AP) — Tight end Vernon Davis won’t be around again this week to help the NFL’s worst passing attack but the 49ers are hoping two other injured players will be able to return for Sunday night’s game against the New York Giants.Davis was ruled out on Friday’s injury report with a knee injury, even though he practiced in a limited fashion throughout the week and both he and coach Jim Tomsula appeared to indicate earlier that Davis would return.“I feel like I’m full speed,” Davis said after Friday’s practice. “I can do the best that I can do right now. I can still be effective.”San Francisco’s offense wasn’t very effective without the two-time Pro Bowl tight end during last week’s 17-3 loss to Green Bay, when the 49ers (1-3) produced a season-low in points and were held below 200 yards for the second consecutive game. Davis had started the first three games of the season.The 49ers got better news regarding left tackle Joe Staley and wide receiver Quinton Patton, who both were listed as questionable for New York.Staley (knee) returned to limited practice Friday after being held out the previous two days and could be ready to extend his streak of 68 consecutive regular-season starts. The four-time Pro Bowler has been the one constant on a restructured San Francisco line that has struggled through the first quarter of the season, during which quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been sacked 14 times.Tomsula indicated there’s little concern the 49ers won’t have Staley on Sunday.Patton practiced on the side for the second consecutive day as he goes through the NFL protocol to return from the concussion he sustained during the second half of the Green Bay game.Patton ranks third among San Francisco wideouts with seven receptions and second with a 12.1-yard average for an offense that has produced 172 total yards passing the past two weeks to sink to the bottom of the league rankings.The 49ers also rank last in the NFL in passing average, yards per play and points per game. They rank 31st in interceptions per play, with Kaepernick throwing five picks with no touchdowns over the past two games.Davis isn’t the only San Francisco regular unlikely to play against the Giants. Outside linebacker Ahmad Brooks, who has not been with the 49ers the past three days because of the death of his sister, was listed as doubtful for Sunday night.“We keep him in our thoughts and prayers,” Tomsula said. “I mean, we’re talking about a family tragedy. That family is going through an awful time right now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:00:47.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
