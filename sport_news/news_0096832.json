After the transfer of Dr Kanta Goel six months back, the post of radiologist has been lying vacant. The ultrasound machine is being operated by a physician who has obtained a short-term training of radiology from the PGIMS, Rohtak. Recently, the Health Department had appointed 39 doctors for Ambala City and Cantonment Civil Hospitals. Only seven have joined duty. The department has offered them the liberty to join duty within a month of their appointment. At the Civil hospital in Naraingarh, there is no physician and surgeon. Patients are either visiting the Cantonment or city Civil Hospitals. A doctor said, “Multi-specialty hospitals in Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula, Gurgaon and a few cities in Punjab have been offering good salaries to young doctors.” Political interference and uncomfortable service conditions were de-motivating doctors to join government job, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:25:03.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
