It's the first year Becker's boys — and one girl — have participated in a national program called Coaching Boys into Men, which is intended to teach the teens to respect one another and treat others with dignity and compassion. \nThose talks have helped coalesce Becker's Papermakers into a team that hits hard, takes care of the ball and is headed to the playoffs. But more important in Becker's mind is that this has helped transform the boys on the team into better human beings. \n\"This has opened our minds to different ways to handle situations. Now I'll say something when someone is bullying someone else,\" said Ryan Kuntz, 18, a Papermakers defensive end. \nTalking as a group about awkward topics has developed strong bonds between team members which is an asset on and off the field, said Alex Kundert, 17, Papermakers center. \nKaylee Jensen (Photo: Jason Becker/Nekoosa HS) \n\"This brought us together as a team,\" Kundert said. \"Its definitely made our team stronger, but it's also made us aware of situations where, now, we'll step in and say something.\" \nThe program's focus on discussing uncomfortable topics, such as sexuality differences, has fostered trust among the athletes, bringing the team together in a way Becker didn't anticipate. \n\"We've been talking about some things that are really personal and this has led them to develop a deep respect for one another,\" Becker said. \"This has created a unity which makes them a strong team. \n\"When we began this, I think a lot of the boys weren't used to sharing their thoughts like this and it started pretty slowly, but now all of them actively participate in these conversations.\" \nThe boys also are holding each other responsible for their actions, said Kaylee Jensen, 17, the Papermakers kicker and lone female member, who's been on the team throughout high school. \n\"I am really proud of these guys,\" Jensen said. \"I started on the team when I was a freshman and it wasn't that uncommon for one of them, as an insult, to say to someone, 'You throw like a girl,' or 'You kick like a girl.' They didn't understand how offensive that is. \n\"It's good that we've had these conversations because now, they remind each other that it's wrong to say things like that,\" Jensen said. \nThe program has changed the dynamic of the team so that everyone feels comfortable talking about topics they probably never would have discussed had their coach not sparked the conversation, Jensen said. \n\"We've talked about a lot of things like domestic abuse and dating violence, that when a girl says 'no,' it means no and to respect that,\" she said. \nThe program gives the students a time and place to have conversations that generally don't happen in school, Becker said. His goal is to include Coaching Boys into Men throughout the athletic programs offered at Nekoosa High School. \nThe Wood County Family Center used a grant through the Green Bay Packers to purchase program materials with the Nekoosa football team being the first to use Coaching Boys into Men. \nThe program is available for use by all Wood County school districts, said Kim Suchowski, the Family Center sexual assault victim services coordinator who manages the program for the county. \nReporter Liz Welter can be reached at 715-898-7008, or by email at liz.welter@gannettwisconsin.com.
