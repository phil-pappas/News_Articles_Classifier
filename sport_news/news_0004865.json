There’s no reason to get mad or frustrated.” Hays and Ghidina have advanced through regional and sectional play to make it to state. The two-day, 36-hole tournament will be held today and Saturday at The Den at Fox Creek Golf Course in Bloomington. The Pekin state qualifiers each shot 79 Monday in the sectional at Spencer T. Olin Golf Course in Alton and finished in a four-way tie for sixth place among individuals. The top 10 individuals advanced. Ghidina earned his spot dramatically, sinking a 60-foot birdie putt on his final hole. Had he missed the long putt and tapped in, he would have been in a playoff for the final state tournament berth. Had he three-putted, he wouldn’t have qualified for state. “That was quite a putt,” McGinnis said. The coach said both his golfers are hungry to do well at the state tournament. “If you had asked them after their rounds Monday, they would have said they left a few shots out there,” he said. It will be the first state tournament appearance for Hays, a junior, and Ghidina, a sophomore. Coach Jamie King’s Morton boys golf team will be taking aim at its second consecutive Class 2A state title at Illinois State University’s Weibring Golf Club. If the Potters win again, they’ll become the first public school team to win back-to-back Class 2A boys golf state championships. Morton has two Division I recruits on its six-golfer state tournament roster — Pete Kuhl (Wisconsin) and reigning state champion Tommy Kuhl (Illinois) — but the brothers can’t win the title by themselves. They’ll need help from Isaac Ingold, Bobby Strode, Adam Christianson and Carter LeRoy. Two of their scores will count each day. King said his team is ready to defend its state championship. The Potters won five invitational championships and the Mid-Illini Conference title during the regular season and posted the lowest score of any Class 2A team in the state at the regional and sectional levels. Just as importantly, the guys haven’t been bothered by distractions. “We’ve had a target on our back all year, but that’s had no bearing on how we’ve played,” King said. “All we’re concerned about is attacking the golf course.” Page 2 of 2 - Dunlap also will be playing as a team at Weibring. The Eagles finished second by a stroke at the 2013 Class 2A state tournament. Ethan Uken, Gabe Sowards and Trevor Hickey played as sophomores that year and are back as seniors. East Peoria’s David Perkins is in the Class 2A state tournament for the third straight year. The Illinois State University recruit was the leader after one round as a sophomore before finishing fourth. He finished 26th last year as a junior and he wants to make amends this weekend in his final high school golf tournament. Like Perkins, Metamora’s Trey Tussey and Peoria Notre Dame’s Miguel Montelongo will play as individuals. Cole Fox and Maverick Wixom from Peoria Christian will play as individuals in the Class 1A boys state tournament at Prairie Vista Golf Course in Bloomington. Girls Washington’s Allison Kinsinger, Limestone’s Amanda Greenan and Erica Kerr from Peoria Richwoods will play as individuals in the 36-hole Class AA girls golf state tournament today and Saturday at Hickory Point Golf Club in Decatur. Metamora’s Mamie Ambrosch will play as an individual in the Class A state tournament at Red Tail Run Golf Course in Decatur.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:20:39.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
