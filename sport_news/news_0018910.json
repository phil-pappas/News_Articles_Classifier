Here is their overview . PFF also assessed Kam Chancellor as the worst at his position this week. \nAnd here are some added notes from PFF as well as snap counts at the bottom. \nOffense Despite the result, Russell Wilson continues his solid play. He finished with a +3.2 overall (+2.6 passing grade) and has the fourth-best overall grade in the past three weeks. Also in the past three weeks, only Carson Palmer and Andy Dalton have a higher pass grade (13.2 and +12.8) than Wilson’s +7.0. Only two of Wilson’s 20 attempts were thrown left of the left numbers. While he went 9 of 11 on throws between 0-9 yards, he only mustered a cumulative -0.4 grade on them. Boosted by his 69 yard TD run, rookie Thomas Rawls graded at +2.5, third-best for Week 5 behind only Doug Martin and Dion Lewis. This week Rawls ranks second in run grade, yards after contact/attempt, and yards/attempt, and first in rushing yards. Doug Baldwin led the receiving core with a +1.4 and now has four straight green games. His +5.3 on the year is 14 th and is a vast improvement from where he was last year at this same time (-0.8). Right guard J.R. Sweezy with back-to-back green games (+1.1 and +3.2). His +2.2 run blocking grade is currently second-best this week among RGs. Aside from Sweezy, the other four starting OL all finished with red grades. Targets: Graham/Lockett 4, Baldwin/Jackson/Kearse/Willson 3 QB hurries allowed: Nowak 3, Sweezy/Okung/Gilliam/Coleman/Willson 1 QB hits allowed: Gilliam 2 \nDefense KJ. Wright led all defensive players with a +3.2 overall grade and interestingly also had the best pass coverage grade on the team (+2.1). The normally high-graded tandem of Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril were held in check grade-wise, combining for only +0.5. Kam Chancellor was the most targeted Seahawks secondary player, allowing nine receptions on 11 targets. Bengals receiver breakdown against him: Sanu 2 of 2, Bernard 3 of 4, Eifert 3 of 4, Jones 1 of 1. Sanu and Eifert combined for 13 of 15 for 159 yards (55 YAC) and two TDs (both Eifert). With the Monday night game to go, Williams currently has the second-worst coverage grade for CBs while Chancellor is last among safeties. Defensive stops: Rubin/Wright 4, Avril/Bennett/Irvin/Shead 3 QB hurries: Bennett/Hill 3, Avril/Marsh/Wagner/Clark 2 Coverage targets: Chancellor 11, Williams 7, Sherman 6, Wagner 5, Wright/Shead 4 Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:15:37.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
