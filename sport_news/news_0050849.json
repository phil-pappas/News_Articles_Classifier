Instead of letting those setbacks pile on to all of the early season misery, though, they fought back. \nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Luhrsen got the Panthers on the board first with a 25-yard scamper about three minutes into the second quarter. When Fergus scored with less than two minutes remaining before halftime, it looked like the two would go to intermission tied. Instead, Belgrade blocked the point-after attempt and then Luhrsen scored his second rushing touchdown of the day, a 27-yard dash, for a 15-6 halftime lead. \n“It was a big turning point for us,” Kinnaman said. “It felt good, even throughout the day, before the game, during warm-ups, the kids had a different feeling to them. It’s just one of those things where you just know things are going to go well.” \nThe teams combined for three turnovers in the opening minutes of the third quarter, but Hayden Van Winkle scooped up a Golden Eagles fumble and rumbled more than 40 yards for a touchdown. \nAll told, Fergus turned the ball over six times. Trey Mounts intercepted Eric Knox early, Zach Spady recorded two picks in the second half, and Luhrsen also got in on the action — and then immediately followed it up with a 55-yard strike to Mounts for Belgrade’s fourth touchdown. \nLuhrsen, who rotated under center with Tanner Campbell on Sept. 18 against Miles City, was responsible for four touchdowns on the night, including an early-fourth quarter pass to Derek Marks that concluded the night’s scoring. \n“He played really well tonight,” Kinnamen said. “He gives us a better threat to pass. He’s a great athlete and I don’t know if we were using his abilities well enough.” \nHAVRE 40, PARK 0: Dane Warp threw three touchdowns and ran for another as the Blue Ponies scored all of their points before halftime and shut out the Rangers. \nThe record-setting signal caller threw three touchdowns to Nate Rimson in the first 14 minutes of action, then Nate Corb returned an interception for a touchdown to put Havre up by 26 early in the second quarter. \nBROADWATER COUNTY 63, THREE FORKS 8: The Bulldogs scored the game’s first 34 points, had 48 by halftime and rolled to an easy win against the Wolves. \nKyle Spritzer ran for four Broadwater County touchdowns, including a 45-yard dash to open the scoring. Quarterback Jace Lewis threw two touchdowns to Quade McQueary, while Billy Mourer returned a second-quarter kickoff 90 yards for Three Forks’ only score. \nSWEET GRASS COUNTY 36, JOLIET 0: The Sheepherders were held scoreless for the first 12 minutes, and then erupted for 29 points in the second quarter on their way to a blowout. \nNathan Baker scored two of his three rushing touchdowns in the second on 41- and 20-yard runs. He dove in from 3 out in the third and had 96 yards on 10 carries. \nRyan Morgan had a 3-yard rushing score and Sam Curry also found the end zone from 15 out. \nSweet Grass gained 297 yards to Joliet’s 81. \nVolleyball \nBELGRADE DEF. GARDINER, 25-11, 25-20, 25-20: Three days after being swept at home by Butte Central, the Panthers went on the road and earned a non-conference sweep against the three-time defending Class C state champion Bruins. \nBelgrade opened with a dominating performance in the first game, and then rode a balanced effort to victory. The Panthers held a 31-22 advantage in kills, getting eight from Sydney Lambeth and seven from Bailey Christensen. \nChristensen also had a game-high four aces, as the Panthers piled up a 13-4 advantage. \nKelsey McDonald and PJ Thomas each had seven kills for Gardiner, which held a 63-46 advantage in digs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:54:15.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
