Tradition counts and game-day experience matters, but recruits like their facilities big, shiny and state-of-the-art. Oregon remains the class of the Pac-12, but in recent years, the rest of the conference has done a better job of trying to keep up with the Joneses, er, Knights.\n“Make no mistake, facilities matter to most recruits,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. “It’s important to keep up with rivals and competitors.”\nAZCENTRAL\nProspects ASU football coaches are watching this weekend\nBut my goodness, how do you keep up with the Ducks? Oregon in 2013 moved into a $68 million, 145,000 square-foot building that blows away recruits with these kind of perks:\nA barbershop in the locker room. A ventilation system in each locker that removes odor. Sofas in the players’ lounge that recline into beds. Foosball tables that feature hand-painted players made to resemble the Ducks and their conference rivals. Even the coaches have it good. In a conference room next to Mark Helfrich’s office is a private staircase that goes four flights down and takes him to his private parking space. The entire staff has access to a 4-foot deep hydrotherapy pool, and televisions are embedded in their locker room mirrors.\n“I look at our league and Oregon and the impact their facility has,” ASU coach Todd Graham said. “You have to win first and foremost, but facilities do impact kids. They’re very impressionable. And it speaksvolumes about what your commitment is.”\nJeff Hawkins, Senior Associate Athletic Director of Football Administration and Operations demonstrates the innovations of the new Oregon Ducks locker room, which includes ventilated lockers with pull-down shelves during a media tour inside the new Oregon Football Performance Center on the Oregon campus Monday, Aug. 5, 2013, in Eugene, Ore. (Photo: Brian Davies/AP)\nThe Ducks are doing something right. They are the fourth-winningest program in the country in the past decade and played in the College Football Playoff National Championship last season.\nAnd despite struggling to a 4-3 start this year, their 2016 recruiting class is ranked in the Top 20 by Scout.com and Rivals.com.\nWhen asked about Oregon’s facilities, Helfrich, a former ASU assistant, called them “immeasurable.”\n“We try to go everywhere in our reach, in our initial screening to come down to a signing class,” he said. “I think what people are most surprised by though is the people. Invariably people are excited by the Nike component, the facilities, all those aspects of it. But then they’re blown away by the quality of people that surround them.”\nAlthough few schools have a donor with the bank account of Nike cofounder Phil Knight, they are finding ways to get improvements done. An example of how much the facility gap is closing is Washington State, which in the past was always playing catch-up with other conference schools.\nOct. 17, 2015; Pullman, Wash.; Washington State Cougars coach Mike Leach looks on against the Oregon State Beavers during the second half at Martin Stadium. (Photo: James Snook/USA TODAY Sports)\nNow, the Cougars have a $61 million, 75,000-square-foot football operations building that includes a giant locker room and auditorium with oversized seats to accommodate those 300-pound-plus offensive linemen.\nAnd WSU coach Mike Leach has a word for those in Eugene.\n“We do have the best facilities in the Pac-12,” he said. “The other part is getting the word out on it. Initially, (recruits) think you’re bragging until they come out here and see it’s a fact. The more that happens, the more it helps recruiting.”\nLeach praised the locker room and also the dining options for his players.\n“All the student-athletes get to mix with the other sports,” he said. “There are two full-time chefs and a full-time nutritionist. The food is incredible up there.”\nSept. 19, 2015; Tucson; Arizona Wildcats coach Rich Rodriguez watches play during the fourth quarter against the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks at Arizona Stadium. (Photo: Casey Sapio/USA TODAY Sports)\nArizona coach Rich Rodriguez wasn’t surprised by Leach’s boast.\n“I’m sure they feel that way and we feel that way and Oregon feels that,” he said. “It feels like everybody in our league has new stuff or is getting that way.”\nRodriguez is proud of the flashy new Lowell-Stevens Football Facility, which includes state-of-the-art perks, including underwater treadmills in the training room and ventilated seats in the locker room.\nRecruits also are impressed by the amenities for fans wanting high-end entertainment. The Sands Club includes lounge seating, climate-control temperature, a buffet and beer and wine service.\n“I think more than anything else (recruits) can get a feel that, ‘Hey, this is big-time, this is a Division I facility,’ ” he said. “It makes an impression. If you got nice stuff, I don’t know if two nice things trump another, but when players come to visit, they want to see a commitment to football.”\nThey do now in Tucson. It was something that was needed, according to former coach Mike Stoops, who told CBSSports.com after he was fired that “when you don't have a football facility and every Mountain West team has one and you don't, that's a problem. We were playing at a BCS level and I feel like I was fighting with a toothpick and they've got a bat.”\nMost conferences coaches agree that you don’t have to have the best facility in the country, but that the university must have enough to show a commitment to the program to impress recruits.\n“Facilities are part of it, because right or wrong, I think outwardly it shows how much the university cares about your program and athletics in general,” Stanford coach David Shaw said. “That goes into where we work out, where’s our locker room, how good is the equipment, where do I get food. All those things now have to be in-house and readily available. I think you have to demonstrate that you’re taking care of them.”\nThe Andrew Luck Auditorium, seen during a media tour Thursday, Oct. 3, 2013, in Stanford, Calif., is part of the new $21 million addition to the Stanford football facility.

(Photo: Antonio Gonzalez/AP)\nIn 2013, the Cardinal unveiled the $21 million addition of the Arrillaga Family Sports Center, which included a new locker room and upgraded coaches' offices. Stanford’s priority is a commitment to its past players, which is demonstrated by a secondary locker area where former athletes can return in the offseason.\n“I really like ours because it’s tastefully done, not overdone because it still feels like a football building,” Shaw said. “I think there’s a good mix of showing past history without going too far into the past.\n“At the same time, it’s a functional space. And we have Andrew Luck on the wall, David DeCastro’s on the wall, Ty Montgomery’s on the wall, Richard Sherman’s on the wall. There’s good space. It’s updatable so guys can see it and say, ‘Someday I could be on the wall.’ \"\nAnother program with new facilities is Colorado, which probably needed an upgrade more than any team in the conference. The Buffaloes haven’t won more than two conference games in a season since 2007 and appear to be headed in that direction again this year.\nAZCENTRAL\nWhat makes Mike Norvell ASU's top recruiter?\nFor years, Colorado struggled with recruiting, surely in part because of facilities that hadn’t had a true overhaul since 1991. Now, the Buffaloes sport new headquarters, the Champions Center, which cost $156 million.\nThere’s a ring room, NFL room and locker room designed so that coach Mike MacIntyre can see every locker when he’s speaking. There’s a room for spin classes and a recruiting lounge with high-rent views.\nIn Seattle, Washington recently underwent a $280 million renovation to Husky Stadium and its football facilities. In 2012, USC unveiled the $70 million, 110,000-square-foot John McKay Center that includes a weight room that is connected to an underground 30-yard indoor field. Each locker in the locker room has its own video screen.\nCalifornia revealed a renovated stadium and fancy training center in 2013 that had a hefty price tag of $474 million, the most expensive facility upgrades in college sports history. The university hoped to fund the facilities through long-term sales of high-priced seats but fell short of its goal. It ended up refinancing the debt and turned to an online game company for stadium naming rights. It is now known as Kabam Field at California Memorial Stadium.\nAZCENTRAL\nASU XTRA app: Get latest news, analysis, scores, photos\nSome schools are still in the process of building new-fangled facilities.\nASU is in the midst of a $256 million Sun Devil Stadium renovation that will include a student-athlete facility built under the north end zone with a patio deck for fans to congregate during games.\n“I think facilities are huge (in recruiting),” Graham said. “I think it’s up there at the top. What it does is show commitment. And it’s not just that, but how you maintain and take care of your facilities. I always say our place needs to look like a place where champions reside.\n“We’re in the process in the next 20 months of having a brand-new facility and having a brand-new stadium. I can’t tell you the impact that’s going to have.”\nUCLA recently broke ground on the Wasserman Football Center, which is expected to cost $62 million, and Oregon State has plans that include expanding the Valley Football Center.\nConference schools are still playing catch-up to Oregon, but the gap is narrowing.\nThey have all come to appreciate just how much cosmetics matter in the recruiting world.\nFollow Paola Boivin at paola.boivin@arizonarepublic.com and at Twitter.com/PaolaBoivin .
