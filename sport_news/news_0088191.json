It was a more talented group of players, to be sure, but there was also a heightened competitiveness and greater team chemistry. This would show itself in the Jays’ resiliency throughout the season.\n“This isn’t the ‘try’ league, this is the ‘get it done’ league. And you know, eventually they’re going to find people to get it done.” — Josh Donaldson , after the Jays were swept by the Houston Astros on May 17.\nThe Jays’ third baseman, already carving out an MVP-calibre season by this point, expressed his frustration as the team’s bullpen blew another lead and the club lost its fifth straight game. It would be their longest losing streak of the season. The Jays underachieved in the first half of the season, outscoring the league by a wide margin but still posting a .500 record. It wasn’t until they bolstered their pitching and defence at the deadline that they really took off.\n“It’s almost like being at war and running low on ammo and the next thing you know here comes a little parachute with a crate. And it lands right next to you and it’s full of ammo. You’re like, ‘Yeah, baby.’ ” — Jose Bautista ’s description to USA Today of what it felt like after the trade deadline.\nThe Jays were by far the most active team at the trade deadline, acquiring an ace in David Price, star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, speedy Ben Revere to lead off and play outfield, while also bolstering the bullpen. GM Alex Anthopoulos would later say he was emboldened to make the moves in part because he believed the team was better than its middling record suggested — pointing to their league-leading run differential — and that the number of remaining games against the New York Yankees mean the division was within reach. The moves paid off handsomely, as the Jays won more than two-thirds of their games following the trade deadline, vaulting themselves into the division lead and the franchise’s first postseason berth in 22 years.\n“That was the best atmosphere I’ve ever been in. I’ve pitched in quite a few big games, but that atmosphere today, that takes the cake.” — David Price , after his first start as a Blue Jay Aug. 3.\nAs he walked off the mound at the end of the eighth inning after retiring his final 15 batters and allowing just one earned run, Price looked up into the sold-out Rogers Centre crowd, smiled and clapped his glove in appreciation. It was the warmest of welcomes for the Jays’ new ace, who would prove vital down the stretch, winning nine of his 11 starts, including three pivotal games against the Yankees, and living up to his billing as a top-of-the-rotation game-changer.\n“You got that feeling every day coming to the field, ‘Who’s next? . . . Whose butt we going to kick today?’ That’s a good feeling. We haven’t had that in the couple years I’ve been here.” — Veteran left-hander Mark Buehrle on Aug. 6, amid the club’s second 11-game winning streak.\nFollowing the trade deadline, the Blue Jays were the hottest team in baseball. They rampaged through August, winning three-quarters of their games, climbing into first place and putting together the best second half in franchise history.\n“It still feels like a dream, to be honest with you.” — Marcus Stroman , after pitching the division-clinching game in Baltimore.\nAmong the many improbable storylines this season was the remarkable comeback of Stroman, the team’s budding ace who tore his left ACL in spring training and was thought lost for the season. Before he even went under the knife, Stroman vowed to return for a post-season run in September and made good on his promise, injecting the rotation with a late-season shot of adrenaline and proving indispensable down the stretch.\n“That’s a home run we’ll be talking about for a long time.”\n“I want to hug him forever.” — Kevin Pillar and Donaldson, respectively, following Bautista’s game-winning home run in Game 5 of the ALDS.\nThe most indelible image of the Jays’ post-season run will no doubt be Bautista’s epic bat flip following his game-winning, three-run homer in the deciding Game 5 of the division series against the Texas Rangers. Bautista etched his name into Jays’ post-season lore with the emotionally charged drive and iconic celebration, which capped one of the strangest innings and most memorable games in Jays’ history.\n“Obviously you don’t feel great about the situation now, but give it a little time to breathe a little bit. Coming into spring training next year I feel like we’re going to have some momentum and you know, there’s been a lot of learning throughout this season for a lot of guys, including myself, and I feel like you can only make it better.” — Donaldson, after the Jays were eliminated by the Royals.\nIt was sombre inside the Jays’ clubhouse following their 4-3 loss to the Kansas City Royals in Game 6, but Donaldson — who is expected to join George Bell as the only Blue Jays ever to win the league MVP — looked forward to next season and the possibility of improving upon the gains made.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:25:09.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
