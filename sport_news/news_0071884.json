The free festivities kick off at 2 p.m. with a children's costume parade around the ribbon at Maggie Daley Park and dance and theater performances in Millennium Park.\nTens of thousands of people are expected to attend the events, which are being hosted by the Chicago Cultural Mile Association, a group devoted to promoting activity along Michigan Avenue between the Chicago River and Roosevelt Road and east to the Museum Campus. The highlight of the spectacle is the parade along Columbus Drive between Balbo Avenue and Monroe Street from 6 to 8 p.m., led by 11 \"creative spirit fellows\" in costume, including Fiasco, \"Hoop Dreams\" director Steve James and photographer Dawoud Bey.\n\"Our intention was to activate Halloween as the artists holiday, and we have artistic groups large and small represented in the parade,\" event spokesman John Pastuovic said.\nThe parade will showcase about 100 artistic groups including representatives from the Field Museum, Joffrey Ballet and journalism and architecture communities, Pastuovic said. A zombie \"Thriller\" dance performance will also be part of the parade.\nCultural Mile Association Executive Director Sharene Shariatzadeh \"very roughly\" estimated the event's budget to be $500,000, which comes entirely from the association. Michelle Boone, Chicago's commissioner of cultural affairs and special events, said the Halloween Gathering is not a city-sponsored event, nor a replacement for Redmoon's troubled Great Chicago Fire Festival, held last month at Northerly Island. The city has said it will not fund the fire festival in future years.\nThe freakiest haunted houses you'll find in Chicago this year Open link \"We're helping with the process and permits for the Halloween Gathering, which is what we would do for any private cultural event,\" said Boone, who will help lead the Halloween parade dressed as the Queen of Culture, according to Shariatzadeh.\nWGN-TV chief meteorologist Tom Skilling's forecast for Saturday calls for showers to develop by the afternoon before clearing up at night. Shariatzadeh said the parade will be held rain or shine but some of the festival events will move indoors to the Fine Arts Building, 410 S. Michigan Ave., if there is inclement weather.\nTeens and adults who attend the events are not allowed to wear masks. Backpacks, large bags, lawn chairs and large umbrellas are prohibited along the parade route.\nChicago Tribune reporter and critic Chris Jones contributed.\ntswartz@tribpub.com\nTwitter @tracyswartz\nHalloween Gathering\nWhen: 2 p.m. festival, 6 p.m. parade Saturday\nHalloween is huge, and this massive costume shop is proof Rick Kogan If it is not disturbing enough to many that Donald Trump has been parading across the nation's television screens seemingly nonstop, imagine what it would have been like to see him a couple of weeks ago, walking (or was that strutting?) one morning down the 4000 block of North Milwaukee Avenue?\n...
