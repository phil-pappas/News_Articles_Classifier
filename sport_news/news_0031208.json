Win or lose, these 2015 Mets do drama as well anyone, right?\nThe 11-game winning streak. David Wright’s injuries. Two opponent no-hitters. Wilmer Flores’ walk-on tears and walk-off homer. Matt Harvey’s, well … general Matt Harvey-ness.\nWhat better way to launch this drama, then, this long-awaited Mets return to relevance, with perhaps the most low-key player on the Mets’ roster?\n“[He’s] just chilled out. He’s a simple guy,” Travis d’Arnaud said of his Game 1 battery mate, Jacob deGrom, who will go against Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw at Dodger Stadium. “Goes out there and keeps himself calm. Goes out there and pitches.”\n“I’m going to try to keep it simple,” the perpetually soft-spoken, long-haired deGrom said in a Thursday news conference. “It’s another game, and just pitch my ballgame.”\nDeGrom’s backstory features its own brand of drama. Whereas the Mets’ other young pitchers arrived with heaps of hype — and have mostly lived up to that hype — deGrom came aboard as a virtual afterthought. He didn’t become a full-time pitcher until his junior year at Stetson University, switching over from shortstop, and the Mets selected him in the ninth round of the 2010 amateur draft, eight rounds after they acquired Harvey. Last year, he won the NL Rookie of the Year award, an outcome that no one on the planet is known to have predicted.\nAsked Thursday whether he has contemplated his unlikely journey to Game 1 starter, deGrom responded, “I really haven’t thought about it too much. I’ve just been trying to prepare like I do for every start in between my last start and this one.”\nFor sure, the right-hander is not the type to dwell upon his own narrative. He followed up his promising freshman season with an even better, first full big-league campaign, ranking among the NL leaders with a 2.54 ERA and 205 strikeouts and making his first All-Star Game. While he scuffled some in the second half, he performed well in his final two starts, striking out 16 and walking just two over 10 innings.\nClayton Kershaw Photo: Charles Wenzelberg “It’s just an explosive fastball,” Kershaw said of deGrom, and the Dodgers’ southpaw added his admiration for deGrom’s command and off-speed stuff.\nKershaw, who is just three months older than deGrom, carries himself with the stature of an all-time great, which he is well on his way to being with his three NL Cy Young awards and one NL Most Valuable Player trophy. DeGrom, with about six years’ less service time than Kershaw, is far more unassuming. He sat quietly at his locker Thursday as teammates conducted interviews, many about him. At one point, walking around the small visitors’ clubhouse, he wore his glove over his cap.\nYet his statistics show that such calm shouldn’t be confused for timidity.\n“Jake deGrom has as much confidence in his own ability as anybody I’ve ever known,” Terry Collins said. “… I think he believes he can get anybody out.\nMets reliever Tyler Clippard has been teammates with Roger Clemens, Mike Mussina and Andy Pettitte with the 2007 Yankees, Stephen Strasburg and Jordan Zimmermann with the recent Nationals and Oakland’s Sonny Gray earlier this year. He knows the range of methods that starting pitchers use to prepare for their starts, with Clemens ranking as the most intense.\nWith deGrom, “It’s a calm confidence,” Clippard said. “I think that’s the best way to be. You don’t want a guy that’s sitting in his locker, with his head in his locker, with headphones on, tapping his toes, overly locked in or overly focused. I think it’s more or less, ‘OK, I’m going about my business. I’ve got to pitch today. Let me go out there and deal.’ That’s kind of the vibe you get with Jake.”\nIt’s the kind of vibe that’s the perfect complement for these drama-addicted Mets. It, and the right arm attached to it, might be the Mets’ best weapon in their desire to create more upbeat drama in this roller-coaster season.\n  clayton kershaw ,  jacob degrom ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:22:01.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
