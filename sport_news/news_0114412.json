Back Photo: 2 of 2 Next AP Michael Dwyer Associated Press Boston College quarterback Troy Flutie looks for running room against Wake Forest on Oct. 10 in Boston. \nThe outcome of Clemson’s game at Miami on Saturday might be decided by which team’s Scott makes the biggest plays. \nThe leading receivers for the teams are sophomore Artavis Scott for the Tigers and senior Rashawn Scott for the Hurricanes — who are both from Florida. \nAlthough they’re different sizes (at 5-11 and 190 pounds, Artavis Scott is giving up 3 inches and 18 pounds to Rashawn Scott) their statistics are remarkably similar: Clemson’s Scott has caught 39 passes for 443 yards, an 11.3 per-catch average and four touchdowns; Miami’s Scott has 33 receptions for 446 yards, a 13.5 average and four TDs. \nArtavis Scott played at East Lake (Tarpon Springs), and Rashawn Scott was at Melbourne Central. \n“The last name is the similarity, and the production is the similarity,” said UM coach Al Golden on Wednesday’s ACC coaches teleconference. “Obviously, Rashawn is 208 pounds, so a little different style on the perimeter. But both are equally effective, no question about it.” \nWhen Clemson coach Dabo Swinney was asked which receiver is more dangerous, he replied: “We’ll find out on Saturday.” \n“They’re both great players,” Swinney said. \nSwinney also said his defense could not key on Rashawn Scott, with Herb Waters , Stacy Coley , Braxton Berrios and Lawrence Cager . \n“This is the best group of receivers that we’ve played,” Swinney said. \nLong-standing foes \nTwo lengthy rivalries in the ACC are being renewed this week. North Carolina will play host to Virginia in the 120th meeting between the schools. They first played in 1892 and haven’t missed a season in 53 years. The Tar Heels, who have won the last five meetings, hold a 61-54-4 lead, 32-13-3 at home. \nIn Winston-Salem, Wake Forest plays N.C. State for the 109th time, and they have played every year since 1910, the ACC’s oldest continuous rivalry. The Wolfpack have a 64-38-6 lead and are 21-16-1 at Wake Forest. The home team has won each of the last eight years. \nTurnover-free Golson \nFlorida State quarterback Everett Golson , who was responsible for 26 turnovers last season at Notre Dame, has yet to thrown an interception or lose a fumble this season. \nWhen N.C. State quarterback Jacoby Brissett ’s streak of 241 passes without a pick ended against Virginia Tech on Oct. 9, Golson took over for having the longest active streak as an ACC player, which has now reached 177 passes. \nFlutie fan \nLouisville coach Bobby Petrino was asked to comment during the teleconference about Boston College quarterback Troy Flutie , the nephew of former BC quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie — whose Hail Mary pass against Miami in 1984 is regarded as one of the greatest plays in college history. \n“That’s a famous name there,” Petrino said. “I’ve had the honor of getting to play golf with [Doug Flutie]. Enjoyed that. Asked him a million questions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:18:08.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
