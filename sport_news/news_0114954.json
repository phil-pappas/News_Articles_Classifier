I don’t give any more answers about Wayne Rooney. I am sick of them,” he added. \nVan Gaal also confirmed that Antonio Valencia has picked up a foot injury during the game, potentially ruling him out of Wednesday’s League Cup tie against Middlesbrough. \n“He had a kick on his foot in the first half... but then he played further. However, at the end, he could not continue,” the manager told the club’s website. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:20:46.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
