He follows Sen. Richard Devlin of Tualatin, an influential co-chair of the Legislature's budget committee.\nThe office oversees the state's elections system, auditors and corporation registry, among other roles. The secretary of state also sits on the State Land Board, which weighs the fate of natural resources including Oregon's forests, coastal lands and rivers.\nAnd, as Oregonians were reminded when then-Secretary of State Kate Brown took over for Gov. John Kitzhaber in February, whoever holds the office is first in line to succeed a governor who leaves office.\n\"I'm running to be the kind of active, progressive leader that Oregonians need on the priorities that are so important to our future,\" he said in a statement that also mentioned his interest in expanding vocational education in Oregon schools. \"Increasing corporate accountability in the workplace, using a wider range of tools to create jobs and combating climate change are just a few of the areas where this job can lead the way.\"\nAnother leading Democrat, Rep. Val Hoyle of Eugene, also is expected to run for the office. Hoyle stepped down as House majority leader in July to kick the tires on a statewide campaign.\nThe three-way battle is shaping up as the most compelling statewide race on next May's primary ballot. No big-name Democrat has signaled interest in challenging Brown when she runs for the last two years of Kitzhaber's fourth term. Rep. Tobias Read of Beaverton also is running unopposed in the Democratic primary for state treasurer.\nHoyle will have to give up a run for re-election to the House. Devlin and Avakian, both in the middle of four-year terms, can keep their current posts if they lose next year.\nAvakian, head of the Bureau of Labor and Industries for the past seven years, is charged with investigating complaints against employers and civil rights complaints involving businesses.\nAnd he's used his power to wade into controversial issues — including ordering Gresham bakery Sweet Cakes for Melissa to pay a lesbian couple $135,000 in damages over its refusal to bake a wedding cake.\nIn 2013, he fined a North Portland bar accused of banning transgender patrons. And he obtained a $2.4 million settlement against Daimler Trucks after employees at the company's Swan Island complained about racial and gay slurs, Nazi graffiti and harassment . Avakian has also advocated for raising the state's minimum wage.\nThe work has kept Avakian in headlines, earning him exposure and some name recognition. But he's also been raising large sums of money this year, with his campaign reporting more than $170,000 in cash on hand. Devlin, thanks to past campaigns, has nearly $300,000 available.\nSo far, just one Republican has declared for secretary of state, Lane County Commissioner Sid Leiken , who had initially said he was exploring a run for governor.\n— Denis C.
