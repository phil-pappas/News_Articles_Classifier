But for such a sparse week, there are some huge games, each one potentially having a big impact on the division races. A rundown of what to look for in the Pac-12 this weekend: GAME OF THE WEEK: Arizona at No. 18 Stanford. The Wildcats won the Pac-12 South Division last season and were hoping a win over UCLA would be the springboard to a repeat. Arizona fell flat instead, blown out at home by the No. 7 Bruins 56-30. The Wildcats are looking for a bounce back against Stanford, which had a rebound of its own, beating Southern California and Oregon State to open conference play after losing its opener to Northwestern. This game will be a contrast of styles: The physical Cardinal against the fast-moving Wildcats. Stanford has won three straight and eight of 10 in the series. BEST MATCHUP: Washington State at No. 24 California. The last time these teams met, they combined for 1,400 yards of offense and 119 points. Cougars QB Connor Halliday broke the NCAA record for passing yards with 734 yards and six TDs, but the Bears won 60-59 behind Jared Goff's 527 yards and five TDS. Goff is still putting up big numbers at Cal and the Cougars have not suffered any kind of letdown with Luke Falk in place of Halliday. Yeah, this will be fun to watch. INSIDE THE NUMBERS: No. 10 Utah, No. 17 USC, Washington and Oregon State have a bye week. ... Oregon has won its last five games over Colorado by an average of 50.8 points. ... Stanford sophomore RB Christian McCaffrey is averaging 222.2 all-purpose yards per game, best in the Pac-12 and third in the FBS. ... Oregon had been in the AP Top 25 for 98 straight weeks before dropping out this week following a lopsided home loss to Utah. IMPACT PLAYER: Arizona State RB D.J. Foster. Last week, the senior became the fourth player in NCAA history to surpass 2,000 yards rushing and receiving, after Stanford's Darrin Nelson, Tulane's Mewelde Moore and Texas Tech's Taurean Henderson. Foster also has a reception in 44 straight games, the longest active streak in the nation and tying John Jefferson's school record set from 1974-77.
