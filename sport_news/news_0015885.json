The corner hasn’t been able to shake a foot injury that worsened over the past week, as he was limping around the locker room and missed the last two practices before being ruled out for tonight’s game against the Indianapolis Colts. Now, the Patriots and Brown have determined the injury will end his season.\nBrown had offseason foot surgery, which required him to delay signing as a free agent until July. He also needed extra maintenance in August, and the injury bothered him again in Week 3, when he dressed against the Jacksonville Jaguars but was the only player who didn’t take the field.\nLast week, though, Brown was optimistic, saying, “I’m fine. I’ll be all right.”\nQuarterbacks were 7-of-11 for 82 yards when targeting Brown this season.\nThe Patriots head into tonight with Malcolm Butler , Logan Ryan , Justin Coleman and Rashaan Melvin as the four cornerbacks. Melvin was claimed off waivers this week from the Baltimore Ravens and has only practiced twice.\nThe Pats released cornerback Bradley Fletcher on Oct. 10, and he is still recovering from a hamstring injury suffered in practice. Robert McClain, who went to training camp with the Pats but was among the final roster cuts, has not been contacted by the team, according to a source.\nThe Brown transaction made room on the 53-man roster for the promotion of offensive tackle Cameron Fleming from the practice squad.\nNo Hightower, either\nThe Patriots won’t have the leader of their linebacker corps against the Colts.\nDont’a Hightower will miss his first game of the season after injuring his ribs last week in the first quarter against the Dallas Cowboys, according to a source. The Pats knew this was a realistic possibility all week, but Hightower was at least able to get through three practices on a limited basis.\nDefensive lineman Trey Flowers also was downgraded to out.\nIt’s possible the Patriots want to preserve Hightower for a crucial upcoming stretch against AFC East opponents. Though it’s too early to know now if Hightower will be ready next week, the Pats host the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in a five-day span, and the Jets boast an especially physical running game.\nHightower, who is the play-caller in the huddle and has been credited by teammates as the brain of the middle of the defense, has 2.5 sacks and one pressure this season. Quarterbacks are 3-of-6 passing for 28 yards when targeting him.\nHightower played through a torn shoulder labrum for the final two months of the 2014 season and made the final tackle of Super Bowl XLIX before Butler’s clinching interception against the Seattle Seahawks, so his proven track record of toughness yielded optimism that he might play through the current injury.\nFor now, the Pats and Hightower preferred to be cautious.\nBostic next up\nLinebacker Jon Bostic wore street clothes during his first game as a Patriot, but he is ready to trade in the casual look for game attire tonight if needed.\nThe Patriots acquired Bostic during the bye week as a depth piece who they hope could blossom further down the line. It’s a tough depth chart to crack with Jamie Collins and Hightower up top, seven-time captain Jerod Mayo coming off the bench and team-favorite Jonathan Freeny , who already landed a one-year contract extension, also in tow. That’s why Bostic was inactive against the Cowboys.\nBut with Hightower on the mend, the Patriots might need a little more insurance against the Colts.\n“The way I look at it, I do what the coaches ask me, and I go out and do it to the best of my ability,” Bostic said. “My thing to do every day is pretty much to show up and be the best football player I can be every day, and just keep getting better.”\nIt’s probably unrealistic to foresee too much more than a special teams role for Bostic if he’s pressed into immediate duty, but he was a proven defensive contributor during two-plus seasons with the Chicago Bears. He led them with 127 tackles and five tackles for loss last season despite missing three games with a back injury, so it’s possible Bostic could snag some snaps from Freeny, who has been on the field for 40 defensive plays this season.\nBostic said the challenge to getting on the field is both mental and physical.\n“A lot of the game of football is mental,” Bostic said. “It’s about knowing your opponent, knowing what defense you’re in, where your help is at. If they run this play, how are they going to try to attack you, and how are you going to play it? It’s about all that stuff. The physical part is easy. I’ve just got to take it one day at a time and keep learning.”\nOne-on-one battle\nThe Patriots have shown in past matchups with the Colts that they prefer to stick one defender on one receiver for the majority of the night. Wideout T.Y. Hilton told the Indianapolis media last week that he knows how the Patriots will defend him, but he’s not sure who will earn the draw.\nLast season, the Pats liked using Darrelle Revis on Reggie Wayne and Kyle Arrington on Hilton, but Revis, Wayne and Arrington are all gone. Tonight, the Pats might simply stick Butler on Hilton with some rotational help over the top when they get closer to the red zone, which was the case against Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown in the season opener. Or, if the Pats know they’re going to give the corner help anyway, Ryan could be athletic enough to stay with Hilton.\nEither way, Butler is ready if Hilton is the assignment.\n“Fast guy, quick guy, can go vertical, runs good intermediate routes,” Butler said. “Just got to be out there covering, competing every play and play fundamental, sound football and go out there and dominate.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:43:26.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
