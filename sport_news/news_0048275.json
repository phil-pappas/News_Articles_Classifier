Wentz had 143 attempts without a pick until then. \nBailey ran for 157 yards and Daurice Fountain had 110 yards receiving for the Panthers. \nThe Bison (4-1, 2-0) have won four straight. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:27:29.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
