To stand in the election, Platini has to pass FIFA integrity checks after the Oct. 26 cut-off for the submission of candidacies. \nPlatini has faced scrutiny from some national associations in Europe over why he was paid 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) by FIFA in 2011 for work carried out up to 2002. \n“Events of recent days have raised a number of issues which do need to be fully examined,” the English Football Association said after discussing Platini at a board meeting on Wednesday. \nBut the FA board decided to stand by a July decision to unanimously support Platini in the presidential election. \n“We thought he was an excellent President of UEFA and could bring those same leadership qualities to FIFA,” the FA said in a statement. “We are still of that view.” \nThe FA noted that Platini is co-operating fully with the ongoing FIFA investigation by the Swiss and has offered to assist the ethics committee. \nIn his first detailed explanation, Platini said Tuesday that he only requested payment in 2011 because, when he took the job as a Blatter adviser in 1998, FIFA’s “financial situation” meant he could not be paid the “totality” of his salary. \nFIFA’s accounts for 1999-2002 show a revenue surplus of 115 million Swiss francs (about $83 million in 2002) but a deficit of 134?million Swiss francs had been forecast. \nIn response to questions about the payment, UEFA said Wednesday: “The president has been fully open and transparent with the authorities. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:16:39.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
