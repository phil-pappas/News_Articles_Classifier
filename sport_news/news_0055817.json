The quests pose mental and physical challenges to participants that require teamwork and problem-solving skills.\n The new 30,000-square-foot facility features 16 quest rooms, a restaurant, and can accommodate up to 300 people, according to The Boston Globe . Participants pass through the quest rooms, completing challenges as they go; if they fail one, they start the quest over or choose another. All gamers have to work together to complete the tasks that range from escape games and puzzles, to obstacle courses and more.\nBoda Borg’s website warns that the challenges are difficult and gamers can expect to fail, but the time spent trying to conquer each one is the fun part.\nA two-hour pass in Malden is $18, or serious gamers can opt for the one-day pass for $28.\nRead more about Boda Borg at the Globe .", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/mV3lrS5Pi3I", "http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2015/09/30/live-action-puzzles-teach-teams-try-and-try-again/FlAXdeSleuB5jxD4C06TnK/story.html", "http://www.bodaborg.com/"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:45:11.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
