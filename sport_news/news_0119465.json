They have been part of most of my professional and personal milestones. We believe elegance is an attitude. I appreciate their eye for detail. When I came on board, I knew I was in fine company, with the likes of Audrey Hepburn having associated with the brand earlier. These watches are perfect as an accessory, subtle, yet elegant.\nWhat makes you so strongly connect with the brand?\nIt's the values that we share. They have held on to tradition and yet, they keep up with times. I am a firm believer of that in my own outlook to life. I value traditions. Whatever your possessions or accomplishments are, you don't need to scream about them from the rooftops. I believe in simple living.\nWhat are the key points that you take into account while picking up a watch?\nIt should look like a timepiece and not something screaming for attention. I choose my accessories keeping in mind my multitasking lifestyle, a schedule or a day. I could be going to my kid's school, going to a conference, for an appearance or to a set - it should be a timepiece that fits every occasion.\nHow have you been managing time with brand and film commitments, while also giving time to your daughter Aaradhya?\nIt's a constant learning process. It's something that you work on every day. Each day brings new surprises. God has been generous in giving me a multi-faceted life from the beginning, and honestly, I would not trade it for anything else. One needs to prioritise. I take out my own moments with Aaradhya; that has never been a difficult for me. I literally plan it every day. A lot of my appearances are planned for weekends. She has been seeing me going out for work, I have always referred to it as 'office'. Making a film is not easy, but I am happy with the way it all rolled, Aaradhya recognising the pace of my work, me being there for her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:33:10.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
