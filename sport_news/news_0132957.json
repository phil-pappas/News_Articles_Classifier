NESN will let the popular Orsillo go after 15 seasons. Sunday will be his last game working with analyst Jerry Remy. “I thought it was beyond unfortunate,” Grande said. As a play-by-play announcer for a Boston sports team, Grande provides a perspective fans can’t. He exchanges texts with Bruins radio voice Dave Goucher and feels a bond with Orsillo and Dave O’Brien, the Sox radio voice who will replace Orsillo on NESN next season. “It’s a fellowship that we all share,” Grande said. Grande worked Sox games on radio during their 2013 championship season when O’Brien was away working for ESPN, and he attended many other Sox games to stay up to date with the team that season. “It changed my perspective about baseball,” Grande said. “Don and Jerry, the popular Quote: is they’re part of your family. They’re more than that. They’re part of your furniture. They’re your couch.” While Grande understands that organizations can hire and fire whichever announcers they want, he believes NESN underestimated Orsillo’s appeal. “You made a decision that is obviously very unpopular with the fans,” Grande said. Grande also believes the Sox and NESN did a disservice to O’Brien by having him replace such a popular broadcaster under difficult circumstances. “With Dave,” Grande said, “now you’ve taken one of the elite radio guys, play-by-play guys in all of Major League Baseball and now you’ve really put in a bad position. I think Dave is so talented and so born to do baseball that in the long run, it’s going to be fine.” Red Sox chairman Tom Werner said Orsillo was let go because the Sox broadcasts needed to be re-energized. Will more fans tune in next season because O’Brien will be calling the games instead of Orsillo? Probably not, but they will if the team wins more games. O’Brien is more of a straightforward baseball announcer than Orsillo, who laughs with Remy throughout many broadcasts. That was the same approach that Sean McDonough took with Remy before Orsillo entered the booth and it worked well this season when there was no reason to focus on the field while the team played so poorly until the last couple of months. Page 2 of 3 - When Grande left his television jobs calling Minnesota Timberwolves basketball and ABC college football to return to Boston to become radio voice of the Celtics alongside Cedric Maxwell, he did so with the understanding that he’d be in line to call Celtics games on television. “In 2001,” he said, “was the deal to come in and do the radio for a couple years and eventually you and Max will slide over to TV? Of course it was. And I believe I was the first person in broadcasting history to be lied to. That’s never, ever happened before or since.” Grande was joking when he uttered those last two sentences. He realizes now that Mike Gorman and Tommy Heinsohn, who are entering their 35 th season on Celtics telecasts, probably won’t retire any time soon, nor does he think they should. They’re beloved broadcasting legends. Replacing them won’t be easy and neither will replacing Orsillo in the hearts of Sox fans. Grande believes it would be even worse for O’Brien if he was joining the Sox from another team. At least Sox fans enjoy and respect his work. So does Grande, but he feels the same about Orsillo. In 1996, when Grande was doing sports flashes and writing for the Big Show on WEEI, he got a call asking if he wanted to do Pawtucket games on radio, but he didn’t want to take a pay cut from about $40,000 to $16,000 or $18,000. “Put that on the list of great choices I’ve made,” Grande said with a smile. Orsillo ending up getting the Pawtucket job and five years later NESN hired him. Now the network is letting him go. NESN reportedly decided several months ago not to renew Orsillo’s contract, but didn’t plan to announce it until well after the season. Grande said he heard about Orsillo’s departure in July, a month ahead of Orsillo. “Did they really think that people weren’t going to find out?” Grande wondered in amazement. Orsillo, 46, hasn’t said much publicly since word leaked that he won’t be back next season. He didn’t return a call from this columnist. After NESN was criticized for not showing the tribute to Orsillo that aired on the video board at Fenway Park last Sunday, during his final home game, the network announced that it had already planned to air its own tribute to him during the season finale this Sunday in Cleveland. That begs the question: Why honor someone you’re firing? Could it be that NESN is doing so only because of the criticism? Page 3 of 3 - Orsillo has landed a broadcast job next season with the San Diego Padres, but other questions remain to be answered. Will Remy return? If he does, will he continue as the game analyst or move to the studio? Remy shot down a report that NESN is considering hiring former St. John’s High star and current Mets announcer Ron Darling. Who will replace O’Brien on radio alongside Joe Castiglione? Lou Merloni? Rob Bradford? Here’s a suggestion from out of left field. Why not Hanley Ramirez? Anything to keep him out of the lineup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:03:11.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
