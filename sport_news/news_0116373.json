That includes good things, but the Bruins don’t seem very interested in those. If they were, they might have won at home for the first time this season at TD Garden on Wednesday night. Instead, they settled for a rotten “first’’– their first overtime loss under the NHL’s new 3-on-3 format, although the 5-4 defeat at the hands of the Flyers could carry an asterisk: Because Ryan Spooner took a hooking penalty 1:36 into OT, the winner – courtesy of Claude Giroux – came during a 4-on-3 play. The B’s never should have gone to extra time, anyway, after taking a 4-2 lead into the third period. “It’s unacceptable. What happened tonight, I think we probably deserved,’’ said coach Claude Julien, whose team came off a two-game, two-win road trip. “They were the hungrier team, and we didn’t respond well.’’ Now 2-3-1 on the season, the Bruins are 0-3-1 at home, where they (and goalie Tuukka Rask) have surrendered at least four goals in each game. Wednesday’s game was the third in six outings in which they blew a two-goal lead. “We have to learn how to play with a lead,“ said Rask, who had a somewhat inconsistent 32-save game. “When you have a two-goal lead, you try to eliminate all the mistakes out there. “We can’t make those. When we make those, they seem to cost us every time.’’ Wednesday’s wild finish capped a strange day at the Garden. Based on the possibility that Patrice Bergeron, whose wife was giving birth to the couple’s first child, and Matt Beleskey (upper body injury) would miss the game, Julien formed four new lines in the morning skate. Bergeron’s availability allowed Julien to reunite two lines (Chris Kelly-Spooner-Jimmy Hayes; Zac Rinaldo-Joonas Kemppainen-Tyler Randell), but more juggling became necessary after Rinaldo was ejected at the end of the first period after taking a major penalty for charging. Suspended by the NHL three times over four seasons with the Flyers, Rinaldo – whose hit knocked Sean Couturier out of the game – is concerned he’ll be disciplined again. “For sure I am,“ he said. “I thought I did the best I could to stay within the rules, and deliver a clean body check.’’ A back-and-forth game swung once Rinaldo’s penalty went into effect at the start of the second period. The Bruins, although without Zdeno Chara (he was penalized for slashing at the first-period siren) for the first 3:32, actually took a 3-2 lead when Kelly scored the Bruins’ second shorthanded goal in as many games at 4:31. Page 2 of 2 - Another swing came about four minutes later. Rask, who’d had a streaky first period (13 saves), stopped Wayne Simmonds’ shot on a 2-on-1 break, and Hayes then rushed up ice with David Krejci’s pass to beat relief goalie Steve Mason at 8:49 to put the Bruins up, 4-2. The Bruins were relatively fortunate to escape the first period in a 2-2 tie – partly due to a couple of lapses by Rask. His failure to cleanly glove Pierre-Edouard Bellemare’s floater left a rebound for the Flyer forward to swat home at 9:28, and he was beaten to the short by Sam Gagner at 15:04 to let the Flyers take a 2-1 lead. The B’s matched both goals, and Bergeron was part of the answer each time. Brett Connolly, skating with Bergeron and Brad Marchand in place of Loui Eriksson (Beleskey’s replacement with Krejci and David Pastrnak), scored his first goal in 10 games as a Bruin at 13:28, popping Bergeron’s rebound past Flyers starter Michal Neuvirth, who brought a shutout streak of 132 minutes, 5 seconds into the game. That made it 1-1. The Bruins’ league-leading power play cashed in on its first chance of the night, with Bergeron scoring his fourth goal of the season – all of them during power plays. Eriksson’s whack at Krejci’s goal-line feed was stopped by Neuvirth and popped in the air, and Bergeron chopped it home before Neuvirth could snare it. Another swing was to come, though: At 6:34 of the third period, Pastrnak couldn’t get a weak-side opportunity past Mason after Colin Miller’s perfect pass, a goal that would have made it 5-2. Instead, Claude Giroux scored at 7:48, and Simmonds tied it at 10:24. “We obviously have to play with more composure when we score a goal, or get scored on,“ Chara said. “We can’t have mental breaks like that.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:52:22.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
