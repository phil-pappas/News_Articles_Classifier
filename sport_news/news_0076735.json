(Tony Dejak / AP) LaMond Pope Chicago Tribune \"There's pressure on this group after last year, and that's a good thing.\" Notre Dame coach Mike Brey \nSOUTH BEND, Ind. â€” Notre Dame's top scorer from last year, Jerian Grant, is with the Knicks. \nNotre Dame's top rebounder from last season, Pat Connaughton, is with the Trail Blazers. \nWhat remains is a group motivated to make another lengthy March run. \n\"We're ready to do this from scratch and we're ready to do this our way,\" forward Zach Auguste said during Tuesday's media day. \"Obviously, we have big shoes to fill with Pat and Jerian gone. But I think we'll be able to do it. We'll be able to be as good if not better.\" \nLast year set a pretty high standard. \nThe Irish went 32-6. They defeated Miami, Duke and North Carolina on the way to winning the ACC Tournament. They then won three games in the NCAA tournament before falling to Kentucky 68-66 in an Elite Eight classic. \n\"This group tasted some amazingly new territory last year,\" Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said. \"They have been unbelievably focused. What's great about kids, as much as they loved Grant and Connaughton, they want to kind of show they are pretty good. \n\"Even though everybody talks about how it may be almost impossible to replace Grant and Connaughton. There has been a great focus, set by (guard Demetrius) Jackson, Auguste, (guard Steve) Vasturia, (forwards V.J.) Beachem, (Austin) Burgett, (Austin) Torres. Those guys, they would like to do that March thing again.\" \nAuguste averaged 12.9 points and 6.5 rebounds per game last season. He's one of three returning players who averaged double figures in scoring, along with Jackson (12.4) and Vasturia (10.1). \n\"We have our nucleus back,\" Jackson said. \"We have the recipe, we know what it feels like to be in that situation. Now we want to take it to the next level. Learn from all the things we did last year. Learn from our mistakes. Learn from our successes and just get better.\" \nAuguste believes duplicating the success begins with duplicating the mindset from a year ago. \n\"We want to come back poor again because that's what helped us become the team we were last year,\" Auguste said. \"That's the place we need to start off with and work our way back up.\" \nThe Irish were coming off a 15-17 record in 2013-14. The element of surprise no longer exists. \n\"There's pressure on this group after last year, and that's a good thing,\" Brey said. \"It's not like I need to put any road maps out there. They want to try to chase it again. We can, but we are a work in progress more early than we were last year. And we're all aware of that.\" \nBrey said he's still trying to figure this team out. \n\"Last year's group was really ready early,\" he said. \"That's probably because of (the summer trip to) Italy and certainly two seniors (in Grant and Connaughton). This group will be one that develops throughout the year. I've tried to remind our staff and our players that as we're still figuring out some moving parts. \n\"But I love what's returning.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:43:29.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
