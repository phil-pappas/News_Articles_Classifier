FIFA's top officials face 90-day suspensions By James Masters CNN POSTED: 12:46 PM Oct 08 2015 UPDATED 3 mins Text Size: SEBASTIEN BOZON/AFP/Getty Images (CNN) - \nIt's an organization that has billions of dollars in its coffers but is still using antiquated fax machines to do business. More from NBC Montana Prince Ali to make new FIFA... \nIt was just another day at FIFA, another crisis, as the organizations head honchos were hauled up before the organization's disciplinary committee. \nSepp Blatter, the president of world football's governing body, and the man who wants to replace him, Michel Platini, head of UEFA, were both hit with 90-day suspensions. \nThere was also a 90-day ban for Jerome Valcke, the general secretary, with the ethics committee investigating allegations he participated in a scheme to profit from the sale of World Cup tickets on the black market. \nAll three have just 48 hours to appeal -- and those appeals must be sent in to FIFA not by email -- but by fax. \nBut while the trio are plotting their next move, who is running world football? \nHello Hayatou \nIssa Hayatou is the man charged with leading FIFA while Blatter is serving his suspension by virtue of being the longest-serving vice president. \nHayatou, who hails from Cameroon, is the head of the African Football Confederation and has served on the executive committee since 1990. \nIn 2011, Hayatou was reprimanded by the International Olympics Committee's ethics commission after admitting he was paid by FIFA's former marketing agency International Sport and Leisure back in 1995. \nThe BBC's Panorama program claimed Hayatou received around $20,000 from ISL. He has denied any corruption and stated that the money was a gift for his confederation. \nThe 69-year-old attempted to become FIFA president in 2002 but was swept aside by Blatter in the election. \nHe has confirmed that he has no intention to stand for the role on February 26 next year. \nBye bye Blatter? \nBlatter has been in charge of FIFA since 1998 but had been poised to step down from his role in February. \nThe 79-year-old won a fifth consecutive presidential election on May 29 but announced that he would be laying down his mandate on June 2 following allegations of corruption. \nA statement released by the office of the attorney general of Switzerland last month confirmed it was examining a contract signed by Blatter with the Caribbean Football Union and an alleged \"disloyal payment\" of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million US) to Michel Platini, the head of European football body UEFA. \nBlatter's lawyers said the Ethics Committee had \"based its decision on a misunderstanding of the actions of the attorney general in Switzerland, which has opened an investigation but brought no charge against the president.\" \nPlatini plummets? \nPlatini, who has run UEFA since 2007, announced that he had submitted his letters of recommendation to become FIFA president just moments before the statement from the ethics committee was published. \nThe Frenchman retains the support of the English Football Association which made a statement Thursday. \nPlatini enjoyed a successful playing career with France, winning the 1984 European Championship finals while he also achieved success in Italy with Juventus. \nHe has rejected the allegations made against him. \nNext president? \nWith Blatter not standing for reelection and Platini's future uncertain, the race for the FIFA presidency -- which will conclude on February 26 -- just took another twist.
