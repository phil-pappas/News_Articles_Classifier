third start off an exteneded layoff could be his best. \n6 Doyouknowsomething – Ugly looking chalk exits a couple of awful efforts, but in much better class; reason he is favored is because of the class relief. \nLong Shot – 3 Warren’s Wesley \nRace 2 – 1 1/16th miles, Purse $55,000, Optional claiming $62,500, 3-year-olds and up \n6 Sammy Mandeville – Exits six graded stakes races for this much softer spot; he won’t see anyone who looks like Smooth Roller or Hoppertunity in this field. \n5 Ground Rules – Game win last time when stalked a pedestrian pace and gutted out the victory; the pace could be soft again if Home School goes unchallenged early. \nLong Shot – 4 Solid Wager \nRace 3 – 6 furlongs, Purse $24,000, Claiming $20,000, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up \n1 Always a Chance – Was unlucky to lose last time when left with too much to do in the home stretch; should be able to save ground once again and come flying late. \n4 Lucky Student – Clearly has the goods to go right to the front; they key will be if anyone tries to escort her early, the most likely candidate would be Tough Annie. \nLong Shot – 7 Shared Image \nRace 4 – 6 ½ furlongs (turf, rail at 30 feet), Purse $52,000, Maiden special weights, Cal-breds, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up \n9 Journeyonthemove – Like the cutback in distance from a 2-turn turf route to this down the hill sprint; parking lot post too is another major advantage. \n1 Slew’s Charm – The fact that she is 7/2 odds with her resume tells you something about the rest of this field; chance to cash a check if she shows her best. \nLong Shot – 7 Appealing Lady \nRace 5 – 1 mile, Purse $25,000, Maiden claiming $40,000, 3-year-olds and up \n10 Woody’s Folly – Exits a turf route, but see that all of his races have come in maiden claiming class; my key vote comes from Rafael Bejarano staying loyal. \n3 Poythress – Sliding down the maiden claiming ladder to this new low class; angle could be he did run the best speed figure race of his life here at Santa Anita. \nLong Shot – 4 Architop \nRace 6 – 6 ½ furlongs, Purse $28,000, Starter allowance $40,000, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up \n4 Zanab – Ran a better than looked race in last; it was his dirt debut, so you have to project if he will improve upon that or not, if he does, he is a player. \n7 Hennythelovepenny – Tepid chalk in a wide open affair; Peter Miller has had 9-of-11 starters this meet finish in the money showing all of them were well spotted, live. \nLong Shot – 2 Cadet Roni \nRace 7 – 1 mile (turf, rail at 30 feet), Purse $53,000, Optional claiming $20,000, Cal-breds, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up \n7 Minster’sadventure – Flavien Prat has finished first twice in a row on this filly; unfortunately for him, he is injured and out of action awhile, Rafael Bejarano up. \n3 Awesome Lookn – Has outrun her high odds twice in a row now for Peter Miller; she is only 3/1 odds tonight, but if she improves another step she is right there again. \nLong Shot – 1 Sadie Clare \nRace 8 – 6 furlongs, Purse $21,000, Maiden claiming $30,000, Fillies, 2-year-olds \n3 Gusto’s Gal – Turned in the worst race possible for a 3/1 price horse in last; two angles to consider, Joe Talamo is riding back, her debut race was not half bad. \n4 Reinahermosa – Finished well in last although never threatened to finish better than for minor awards; will need the race to fall apart to have a stronger shot. \nLong Shot – 10 Juju’s Mojo \nBest Bet - 1 Always a Chance (race 3) \nSanta Anita Sunday - Picks/Winners/Mutuels, 17/5/$37.00; Long Shots, 7/2/$13.80; Best Bet, 1/0/$0 \nSanta Anita Totals - 104/24/$141.60; Long Shots, 52/11/$156.20; Best Bets, 4/2/$5.60 \nSIMULCAST PLAY OF THE DAY - #1 Rumble Doll (2/1) in race 8 at Belmont Park. For scoring purposes, we'll make a hypothetical $2 win, place and show bet, $6 total. On Sunday, Carella ran third at Belmont Park paying $2.50 to show.
