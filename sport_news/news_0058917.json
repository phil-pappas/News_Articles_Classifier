Staff file photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow MARIETTA — Walton was down, but never out in Tuesday’s second-round match of the Class state playoffs. When the Lady Raiders felt victory was within their grasp, they clamped down even harder on Johns Creek and came away with a 3-0 sweep in a battle of highly ranked teams. Despite trailing in every set, Walton found a way to come out on top, winning 25-22, 25-23, 25-11 over Johns Creek.Celeste Fitzgerald led the Lady Raiders with 33 digs, six assists and two aces, while Gabby Gonzales added 23 kills and eight digs. Tai Bierria totaled 10 kills and nine digs and Dalaney Hans contributed 30 assists, three kills and seven digs.After losing in the second round last season, Walton advanced to the state quarterfinals, which will be held Saturday. The Lady Raiders will find out who their opponent will be following today’s GHSA seeding meeting.“Johns Creek is a great team with a great group of athletes,” Walton coach Suzanne Fitzgerald said. “They pushed us to our limit. We were knocked out in the sweet 16 last year, so it was a little nerve-racking coming into this match, but our girls were able to overcome those fears and we’ve boosted our confidence moving forward through the playoffs.”Walton never trailed by more than three points in any set. Johns Creek took a 14-11 lead in the first set following Mikaela Gauthreaux’s ace, but the Lady Raiders tied the contest at 14-all after a Johns Creek blocking error.There were 13 first-set ties, the last of which was at 19-all following Bierria’s kill. Walton built a 22-19 advantage behind Sam Jones’ service game and took match point off Hans’ kill.Walton took a 3-0 lead in the second set, but found itself trailing 8-6 after an attack error. Another attack error left the Lady Raiders trailing 14-11 and Gauthreaux’s kill put Johns Creek on top 20-18 later in the set.Undaunted, Walton once again found a way to win as Bierria’s kill brought the Lady Raiders within one. Back-to-back kills from Gonzales put Walton ahead by one, and following a Johns Creek timeout, a Lady Gladiators attack error left the Lady Raiders with a 22-20 lead they did not relinquish.Selah Malcoln and Caroline Mohler combined on a block-assist to tie the set at 23-all, but Gonzales stepped up again with back-to-back kills for a 2-0 set advantage.“This group is highly competitive,” Suzanne Fitzgerald said. “When you train day after day in such a competitive environment, when you get in these adverse situations like we had in the first two sets, you play the way you practice, and these girls did that.”Walton fell behind 3-0 in the third set, but it rallied to stake a 6-3 advantage behind Celeste Fitzgerald’s service game. Ahead 6-5, the Lady Raiders won five of the next six points and built an 11-6 lead. Leading 12-8, Walton scored five straight points during Jones’ service game and moved ahead 22-9 off Bierria’s service run to put the set out of reach.Fitzgerald’s ace left Walton with a 24-11 advantage, and block-assists from Gonzales and Meghan Froemming sealed the third-set win and the match.“During the 10-minute break (between the second and third sets), I told the girls to not let up,” Suzanne Fitzgerald said. “There’s a sense of calm for a coach when you can execute like that in the third set.”Gauthreaux finished with eight kills, six digs and two aces for Johns Creek, which had seven attack errors in the third set. Wesli Ann Wernick had 12 assists and three digs, while Madeline Savage added seven kills and 10 digs. Erin Williamson chipped in with 13 digs and Shelby Tromer had 12 assists.“It was tough mentally for us, being down 2-0,” Johns Creek coach Beth Stephens said. “We played two tough sets with them, but it was tough for us to keep our wits up at times. Walton’s a great volleyball team, and they played well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:10:47.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
