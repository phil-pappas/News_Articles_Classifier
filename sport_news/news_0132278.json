Photo by Derek Leung/Getty Images Last season (his first in St. Louis after signing a big contract in free agency) did not go as well as many had hoped for Paul Stastny . In the early goings of the 2015-2016 campaign, he had seemed to have righted the ship. Unfortunately for him, an injury has brought an abrupt stop to his successful start.\nOn Wednesday, the St. Louis Blues announced that Stastny has been placed on injured reserve due to a broken foot. The 29-year-old center will be re-evaluated in five weeks.\nStastny suffered the injury during Fridayâ€™s 4-3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks. He was forced out of the contest in the second period, did not return, and has not played since.\nThrough five games this season, Stastny netted one goal and five points. He played in 74 regular season games for the Blues last season, scoring 16 goals and 46 points. He added one goal in six playoff contests.\nOn the first day of free agency in the summer of 2014, Stastny inked a four-year contract with the Blues worth $28 million. At the time, the $7 million annual salary made him the highest-paid player on the team (he has since been surpassed by Vladimir Tarasenko in that regard).\nA second-round selection (44th overall) by the Colorado Avalanche in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, Stastny spent the first eight seasons of his NHL career in the Mile High City. In 617 career games with the Avalanche and Blues, he has scored 177 goals and 509 points.", "external_links": ["http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/boxscore?id=2015020062", "http://blues.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=784118&navid=DL|STL|home"], "published": "2015-10-22T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:23:08.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
