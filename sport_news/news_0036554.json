Join the Conversation Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 1:07 p.m. CDT October 12, 2015 Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn talks QBs and Kentucky. Matthew Stevens \nAUBURN — The mystery continues on who will be Auburn’s starting quarterback for the Thursday night game at Kentucky. \nUnlike what he’d done the last two weeks, Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn decided to not announce a starting quarterback between Sean White or Jeremy Johnson during his weekly media conference and added that decision won’t be made until “later in the week”. \n“By the end of this week, we’ll have who will start,” Malzahn said Monday morning. \nMalzahn’s lack of an announcement on the situation comes less than 24 hours after Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said “I don’t know” about the quarterback competition during the Tigers bye week preparations. \n“I believe in both of those guys. I really do,” Lashlee said Sunday night. “I haven’t given up on them because I know what they got in them and I like the way they’ve approached practice lately, and competing and preparing. All you can do is keep working, keep pushing through and make something happen.” \nAuburn Tigers quarterback Jeremy Johnson (6) talks to Auburn Tigers quarterback Sean White (13) after the NCAA football game between LSU Tigers and Auburn on Saturday, Sept. 19, 2015, at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, La. LSU Tigers defeated Auburn Tigers 45-21. Albert Cesare / Advertiser (Photo: .) \nMalzahn did give a hint Monday morning by saying White “has done nothing to lose the job” in his first two career starts the last two weeks against Mississippi State and San Jose State. \n“(White) has done a very good job (but) we just wanted the guys to compete,” Malzahn said. “I think it has been good for both of them.” \nMalzahn said Monday the decision on starting quarterback “could be” a game-time decision but also said a final call could be made by the end of preparation for Kentucky tomorrow. \n“Honestly, we’ve been able to play with both of them and knowing the ability of both of them…it’s not really a worry thing,” Auburn receiver Melvin Ray said Monday. “I could see why there’s a battle between those two now because it could go either way. It’s just all about whoever can give us the best chance.” \nMalzahn said Monday that the competition has been good for Johnson to “be back in the mix” from a confidence standpoint after benching the junior from Montgomery. Johnson’s six interceptions in his first three starts led Malzahn to bench him in favor of White . \n“He’s actually had a quite positive attitude (and) people wouldn’t think so, but ever since he’s been demoted or what not he’s had a good attitude, he’s been working really hard and looking really good,” Ray said Monday.

(Photo: .Albert Cesare / Advertiser) \nHowever, White, the 6-foot signal caller, inability to create big plays with his arm have forced the quarterback competition. \n“That's been probably the biggest issue we've had as far as getting in rhythm or as putting points on the board,” Malzahn said. “We've got that plan during the off-week moving forward, personnel-wise and everything that goes with that, so hopefully that will carry over to Thursday night.” \nKentucky head coach Mark Stoops says he there is no need to change the game plan for either quarterback because what the Tigers have asked both players to do behind center doesn’t change. \n“Not a whole heck of their offense changes,\" Stoops said Wednesday during the SEC coaches teleconference. \"They're very creative in what they do and put a lot of pressure on you. It all starts with them being physical and running the football.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RCSMM3 Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:34:47.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
