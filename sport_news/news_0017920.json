We have to improve.\" \nBarca's victory, with Neymar scoring four and creating one for Luis Suarez, put them level on 18 points with Real Madrid at the top, although Villarreal can reclaim first place with a win at home to Celta Vigo later on Sunday. \nBarca's next outing is on Tuesday when they travel to BATE Borisov for their Champions League Group E clash.
