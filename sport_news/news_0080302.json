He also featured in the Royal London Series against New Zealand a month later, before suffering a side injury. \nHe will also replace Finn in next month's one-day international squad to face Pakistan. \nAn England and Wales Cricket Board press release read: \"Steven Finn has been ruled out of the remainder of the tour of the UAE with a bone stress injury to his left foot, which requires a period of off-loading to aid recovery. \n\"Finn will return to the UK today for further assessment. \n\"Pace bowler Chris Jordan has been called up to both the Test and ODI squads to face Pakistan and will arrive during the first Test.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:07:04.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
