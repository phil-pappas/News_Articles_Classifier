Indians take Game 2 10-2, split doubleheader with Twins Associated Press | 0 comments \nCLEVELAND (AP) — Cody Anderson pitched seven shutout innings and Jose Ramirez hit a three-run homer, leading the Cleveland Indians to a 10-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins Wednesday night to split a doubleheader and stay alive in the AL wild-card race. \nMinnesota won the first game 7-1 and pulled to one game behind the Angels for the second wild-card spot — Los Angeles lost to Oakland Wednesday night. \nCleveland is five games behind L.A. and still faced potential elimination Wednesday if the Astros beat the Mariners later. The Indians would also be eliminated if the Yankees and Rangers won Wednesday. \nAnderson (7-3) held the Twins to two hits and won his fifth straight start. \nCleveland scored four runs in the second off Mike Pelfrey (6-11), who lasted 1 2-3 innings, and Francisco Lindor, continuing his case for rookie of the year, belted a two-run homer in the fourth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:18:40.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
