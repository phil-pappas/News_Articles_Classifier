Here's Torre's statement in full: \n\"I recognize that there has been much commentary and many questions regarding the unfortunate play in last night's game in which Ruben Tejada was injured. As I said after the game, the determination of whether a baserunner has intentionally interfered with a player attempting to turn a double play is left to the judgment of the Umpire on the field, and that judgment call is not subject to review. I should add that determining where to draw the line between an illegal slide and a legitimate hard play is an extremely difficult call for our Umpires. \n\"However, after thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley's action warrants discipline. While I sincerely believe that Mr. Utley had no intention of injuring Ruben Tejada, and was attempting to help his Club in a critical situation, I believe his slide was in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a)(13) \n\"We have been in discussions with the Players Association throughout the year regarding potential rule changes to better protect middle infielders, and we intend to continue those discussions this offseason.\" \n\nWith Utley's appeal -- which MLB is said to be hearing sometime Monday before the series continues -- his suspension will be held in abeyance until the process is completed. Here's a statement by Utley's agent , Joel Wolfe: \n“” \n\n\"I can't worry about what's happened in the past. We're trying to have rules that are going to keep these players on the field.\" \n\nHere is the play in question, which resulted in Tejada fracturing his fibula. \nGame 3 of the best-of-five NLDS between the Dodgers and Mets is set to take place in New York's Citi Field Monday night at 8:07 p.m. ET. The series is tied, one game apiece. \nChase Utley has been suspended for two games.
