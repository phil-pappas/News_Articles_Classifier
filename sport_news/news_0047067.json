(AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File) \nINDEPENDENCE, Ohio — Tristan Thompson has gone from boxing out to holding out. \nHe's taken his contract standoff with the Cavaliers to another level. \nThe backup power forward declined to sign a one-year, $6.8 million qualifying offer for this season and didn't report to training camp Friday as the Cavaliers practiced at Cleveland Clinic Courts. \nDespite optimism from the Cavs and LeBron James that a deal could be reached, Thompson remains at odds with the team over a long-term deal. Thompson had until 11:59 p.m. EDT Thursday to accept the offer, but let the deadline pass and the Cavs chose not to extend it. \nCavs coach David Blatt joked that he was sleeping when the deadline came and went. He was adamant that he will not allow Thompson's contract to become a distraction for his team. \n\"We got a veteran group,\" he said. \"We got a very professional group of guys going about their business and going about their jobs the way that they should. The team is working and we are going to continue to do so. We're just back at it. We've got to focus on the now and here and that's what we're doing.\" \nThompson's holdout is the second obstacle the Cavs have already faced in camp. Guard Iman Shumpert underwent surgery on his right wrist earlier this week and will be sidelined for at least three months. \nAn elite rebounder who knows his role, Thompson was a key contributor during Cleveland's run to the NBA Finals last season, filling in when starter Kevin Love dislocated his shoulder. Thompson and his representatives believe he deserves a maximum contract. And while the Cavs value Thompson, they aren't willing to go beyond what they're comfortable offering. \nJames said twice in the past few days that he was confident the sides could reach a long-term deal. James is also represented by Thompson's agent, Rich Paul. \nCavaliers center Anderson Varejao went through a similar contract dispute in 2007 before he signed a three-year, $17 million offer sheet with Charlotte that was matched by Cleveland. \n\"It wasn't easy for me. I missed the first 21 games if I remember,\" Varejao said. \"But I had to do it back then because I felt like I was disrespected with the offer they offered me. I don't really know what's going on with Tristan right now, numbers and stuff, I'm not sure. But I'm pretty confident he will be here soon.\" \nGeneral manager David Griffin expressed optimism Thursday that Thompson would report to training camp. \n\"We fully expect he'll be here in some form or fashion and we're excited to get going,\" Griffin said on NBA TV. \"We're hopeful that he wants to move forward with his teammates in the same way we want to have Tristan here. If we can come to some agreement we will.\" \nThe fourth overall pick in 2011, Thompson averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds in 15 starts in the regular season. With Love out, Thompson's minutes increased and he averaged 9.6 and 10.8 rebounds in 15 postseason starts. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:15:50.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
