D’Antoni, 64, has been absent from a head-coaching post since he resigned from the Los Angeles Lakers at the conclusion of the 2014 season, only to see offensive systems eerily similar to his Phoenix Suns ’ Seven Seconds Or Less system carry Golden State, Houston and Atlanta deep into last year’s postseason.\nSI.com recently caught up with D’Antoni to discuss his impact on the game, as well as the Golden State Warriors , Steve Nash and a host of other topics. Is it only a matter of time before he’s back on an NBA bench?\nSI.com: Your father was a high school coach, did his teams play small and fast?\nD'Antoni: He played fast. I think the thing is you always play with what you have in high school. It was always very fastbreaky-type basketball. And then when I went to Marshall, we did the same thing. We had a weird team. Our center was 6’5” and the forward was about 6’10”, but he shot from the outside. We were up and down a lot. I think it was all kind of instances. I played for (longtime Nuggets coach) Doug Moe for a bit. He was up and down, especially his teams in Denver. I played in the ABA and it was fast. I kind of grew up on everything that was fast. The three-point line changed everything and the players’ ability to be able to make three-pointers changed how you attacked the basket. But I’ve definitely always been kind of schooled in fast-breaking basketball.\nSI.com: How did your years playing in Europe impact your eventual coaching philosophy?\nD'Antoni: I think because the line was a little closer and the players shot it even better, I think it gave me an insight of how dangerous the three-point shot could be and it could be a heck of a weapon. Also, the players were more skilled in Europe and it allowed me to be able to experiment and take chances that maybe, if you’re thrown into an NBA situation immediately, you don’t take a chance and you don’t think outside the box and you kind of do everything like everybody else is doing so you don’t get fired. But Europe allowed me to experiment and I happened to have the right players on certain teams that were able to do that.\nSI.com: Obviously you had a tremendous amount of success in your first year as the head coach in Phoenix, as did Steve Kerr this year. Did his immediate success remind you of yourself?\nD'Antoni: Yea, and they played a very similar style. They have Stephen Curry who can shoot it as well, if not even better than Steve Nash, and a lot of the same type of players. Draymond Green can guard inside, outside, plays a little bit like Shawn Marion . Everyone has their strengths and weakness and everybody’s a little different, but they played a very similar style that we tried to play in Phoenix.\n• MORE NBA: Training camp storylines: Western Conference | Eastern\nPhoto: Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images\nSI.com: When Steve was putting together his schemes and strategies in the preseason, did he consult with you?\nD'Antoni: No. I talked to him a little bit when the playoffs started, but he’s a great coach and Alvin Gentry is there and he was there the whole time for everything we did in Phoenix. They knew what I was thinking and how I was thinking. They didn’t really have to.\nSI.com: From afar, what were your impressions of the entire Finals?\nD'Antoni: I just enjoyed it as a fan first of all, just to watch some of the best. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson and Draymond Green and guys like that, they just kind of took it all to another level. First and foremost just as a fan I loved watching them play. It was a great, great playoffs and I expect it to happen again.\nSI.com: There was always a knock on your Suns teams struggling to defend. Does that make the Warriors’ run even more impressive, the fact they were able to push the tempo, play small, but still lock in defensively?\nNBA Video Roundtable: Which NBA star is under the most pressure this season? by SI.com Staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:55:40.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
