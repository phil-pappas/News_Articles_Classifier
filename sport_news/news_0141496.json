(Photo: Special to the News Journal) \nIn a quest to try something new and bold, James Stinson made the 1997 Santa Rosa Island Triathlon his first triathlon. \nHe borrowed a bike in order to participate in that portion of the event. \n\"I had known about triathlons and watched some and it was like, 'I can do that,' so I took on the challenge,\" said Stinson, 56, a Cantonment resident and fitness performance enthusiast. \"I had very little knowledge and very little training.\" \nWhen he competes in Saturday's 20th annual Santa Rosa Island Triathlon on Pensacola Beach, this will be Stinson's 167th triathlon. In his age bracket, he's in an elite level of participation among triathletes across the nation. Santa Rosa Island Triathlon \nSo fitting, too, that his latest triathlon will be a grand moment through an enduring history of the Santa Rosa Island Triathlon. This event, after all, has been wiped out by Hurricane Ivan (2004), shortened to only a 5K race (not a triathlon) the next year, then canceled by threat of Tropical Storm Karen two years ago. \n\"It is a special event,\" said Charles Gheen, race director for the SRI Triathlon. \"We have been a national triathlon of the year three times in our history, but this is going to be the best one ever. \n\"Events come and go ... and this one has had every chance to die. But it has a great reputation. It has a hard core of followers that run it every year. We have so many repeat and loyal athletes. And that has allowed it to continue this ride.\" \nThe ride has just gotten a boost, too. \nLocal attorney Joe Zarzaur, whose image is on billboards across town, has become the event's first presenting sponsor. As part of that benefit, each of the more than 1,200 competitors will receive a Headsweats visor, along with other additions to the race experience. Injured veterans take on triathlon camp, body and mind \nZarzaur, a fitness and area sports enthusiast, is a financial supporter of a wide variety of events, including the Pensacola Marathon, the Pensacola Double Bridge Run, the Bud Light Tennis Tournament. In the SRI Triathlon, he sponsors two teams, \"Gavel Girlz and Gavel Guyz\" with the money they raise going to benefit area charities. \n\"He is just a great guy,\" said Gheen, who first met the personal injury attorney more than eight years ago. \"He has helped us advance this race. He is an Ironman triathlete himself and a runner. He is the ideal fit to be a partner of ours.\" \nFor the 20th race, expect a repeat overall winner. Brian Fleischmann, who repeated last year as overall champion, is traveling back to compete again. The former Florida State swimmer, has been an elite triathlete in his age group. \n\"He's been doing this for 13 or 14 years now,\" Gheen said. \"To be this good, this long, not many do that.\" \nThe Pensacola area has an active triathlete community. \nCantonment resident James Stinson competes in his 167th triathlon Saturday. (Photo: Special to the News Journal) \nAlex Bell, president of Tri Gulf Coast, said the organization was formed in 1997. Two years ago, it had about 250 members. Now, there are 543. \n\"We averaged between 180-190 participants for our training sessions each Sunday for this (SRI Triathlon) race,\" Bell said. \"We started those on June 1 and went every Sunday morning.\" \nTheir participation, combined with triathletes traveling here from neighboring states and other parts of the country has made the SRI Triathlon a signature event on the area fitness competition calendar. \n\"It has come a long way,\" Bell said. \"Pensacola is a relatively small community, but for its size it has a great repertoire of races. Virtually every weekend there is a 5K race or something larger, or there is one within a 90 minute drive.\" \nAfter his participation in the second SRI Triathlon, Stinson has signed up for every succeeding one. He has seen the bike and running courses altered by weather and other factors. He has competed in the swim portion in the Gulf, the Quietwater Sound and Little Sabine. \nHe has won his age division multiple times. No matter what the challenges, the triathlon has stayed together as a signature event. \n\"It is always on my calendar of events to do,\" said Stinson, who works at Ascend Performance Materials. \"I have been blessed. I wish I could say I have done every single one of them, but almost (entered 19 years). \n\"It is a first time race for so many people. It is phenomenal for the beach, phenomenal for the community. I think we always had a sense of pride this is our local race.\" \nTriathletes get ready to hit the water in 2011 during the Santa Rosa Island Triathlon at Pensacola Beach. (Photo: John Blackie/jblackie@pnj.com) \nGheen ran his first triathlon in 2001. He's been the race director for eight years. In many ways, Saturday's race is a new beginning. Because the triathlon was canceled in 2013, the money was refunded into race entry fees last year. \nGheen said it cost the organization about $75,000. \n\"We emptied our treasury,\" he said. \"Last year, we were recovering from the washout, and we had a horrible windy day ... So this one looks like it will be great weather. \n\"This is redemption for 2013 and '14 definitely.\" \nWant to watch? \nWHAT: 20th annual Santa Rosa Island Triathlon \nWHERE: Pensacola Beach \nWHO: Competitors in all age groups, including some participants in their 70s. \nCOST: Free \nFORMAT: Beings with a 1/3-mile swim in Gulf of Mexico (in front of Dock and Casino Beach Pavilion), then an 18-mile bike race through the Gulf Islands National Seashore area, then a 3.1-mile run along Pensacola Beach to finish in the Casino Beach area. \nPOST RACE: Party for competitors at Casino Beach area. \nTRIATHLON EXPO : Today from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., along with packet pickup for triathlon competitors at the Holiday Inn Resort on Pensacola Beach.
