So all Harvick did was lead a career-high 355 laps of the AAA 400.\nStarting 15th, his place in the Chase points standings after qualifying was rained out Friday, Harvick seized the lead from polesitter Matt Kenseth on lap 24, then paced most of the remaining laps, including the last 43.\nIn dominating, the defending Chase champion gained his first Dover win in 30 starts. Talk about excellent timing . . .\nMeanwhile, Harvick's adversary, Jimmie Johnson, encountered a major problem with the rear axle on his No. 48 Chevrolet. Johnson drove his wounded car to the garage area on lap 105. Following repairs, he returned to the track on lap 139 and finished 41st, 36 laps down.\nMore coverage WATCH: Latest sports videos BUY: Philly sports gear DISCUSS: Join our sports forums The six-time Chase champion is out of the Chase contention after starting the race fifth in points. He missed the cutoff line for the Chase by 12 points. Johnson is Dover's all-time race winner with 10. He had won three of the last four Dover races.\n\"Definitely disappointed,\" Johnson said. \"It's tough having a very inexpensive axle seal be the culprit and take your championship hopes away. It's racing. I've had mechanicals take me out of championships growing up that led to some success for myself and I'm sure helped me with a championship or two. It's just part of racing. It just shows how critical everything is on a race team.''\nThat Harvick would win and Johnson would fail to advance is an unexpected dramatic twist to what happened after the first Chase race at Chicagoland Speedway. Johnson's car slammed into Harvick's on a restart, causing a flat tire that sent Harvick spinning and crashing. Afterward, when Johnson attempted to talk about the situation, Harvick shoved him.\n\"The circumstances today were pretty straight forward: We didn't have any crazy endings,\" Harvick said, following his 31st career Cup series victory. \"I never felt any pressure. We all knew what we had to do. Everybody was flawless.\n\"This is a lot of fun to be in these situations and succeed. When you don't succeed it's not near as much fun, but it just makes them extra special.''\nHarvick's crew chief, Rodney Childers, was as confident as his driver.\n\"If we would've had qualifying Friday, we would've led 400 laps,\" Childers said, referring to qualifying being rained out. \"We came here to win. We're not going to ride around fifth all day and wait to take the lead at the end.\n\"So many things could've gone wrong. It's just nice to have a fast car and have things go smoothly. We've made mistakes. We tried not to have those today.''\nIn the previous race at New Hampshire, Harvick paced 216 laps, but ran out of fuel with three laps remaining and finished 21st.\nJoining Johnson in failing to advance to the Contenders Round are Jamie McMurray, Paul Menard and Clint Bowyer. Those four are out of contention for the championship. McMurray is 12th in Chase points, but he gets bumped by Harvick because a win secures a place in the next round.\nKyle Busch, one point from the cutoff line prior to yesterday's race, led 19 laps and finished runner-up to qualify for the next round.\n\"We finished where I thought we deserved to be,\" Busch said. \"For as fast as Kevin was, I don't know if I could have had eight (fresh) tires and would have beaten him.\"\nDale Earnhardt Jr. finished third to qualify for the next Chase round by 12 points. Earnhardt overcame a loose left rear wheel on his No. 88 Chevy late in the race.\n\"I was a couple laps from coming in (to the pits),\" Earnhardt said. \"I wasn't going to bash my head against a concrete wall for a damned loose wheel, so we just came in sooner than later.\"\nChaser Martin Truex Jr., forced to start last when his No. 78 Chevy failed prerace inspection for a right rear wheel well problem, drove the wheels off to finish 11th. Truex was as high as second in the race two-thirds of the way through.\nPit stops The victory was Kevin Harvick's first since Phoenix in March. He was the points leader most of the season . . . Jeff Gordon finished12th in his final Dover race. He's seventh in Chase points . . . The race, run on a windy, overcast day, started about 2:50 p.m. By the time the race ended at 6:10 p.m., the drivers were thisclose to needing headlights on their race cars.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:41:25.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
