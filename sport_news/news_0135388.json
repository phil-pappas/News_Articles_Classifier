Rooting for a team that hasn't won the World Series for more than 100 years? No, thanks.\nBut with the wild card play-in game looming Wednesday, a real shot at the Series doesn't seem so far-fetched, say some Cubs fans who are itching to tell their haters \"I told you so!\"\n\"I didn't drive all the way from Indianapolis to see them lose,\" said Calla Keith, 68, who was in town to attend a recent game. \"They're going to win the whole thing.\"\nSome may choose to ignore all the hype, but for those who want to join in, here are 10 things you should know in order to jump into one of the most patient and passionate sports fandoms around:\n1.

And no pressure, but if the Cubs don't win Wednesday's one-game playoff against the Pittsburgh Pirates — season over. Hello 2016.\n3. Theo Epstein, the president, is one of the youngest executives in Major League Baseball. He helped the Boston Red Sox break their 86-year drought.

That's the spirit; take that and multiply for the Cards.\n7. Professional baseball seems to be riddled with lame mascots, but only a very special person would think that a pantsless bear named Clark is the way to represent passion, skill and ferocity. At least the kids like him. Selfie away.\n8. Cubs fans are generational, so don't be surprised to find three or four generations of one family decked out head-to-toe in Cubs gear.\n9. The Curse of the Billy Goat. Even fans think it's stupid. Yet, somehow, it's the cause of all the Cubs' woe. Some believe the curse was placed on the team when Billy Sianis, owner of the Billy Goat Tavern, was kicked out of Wrigley Field in 1945 because he brought his pet goat to a game and fans complained about its smell.\nThe Cubs in the postseason A look back via vintage photos and video of the Chicago Cubs and their checkered history in the postseason.
