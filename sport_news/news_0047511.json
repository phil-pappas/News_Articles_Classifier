That's probably the only similarity that, for sure, is like 2010-11.\" \nWelinski, a native of Duluth, Minn., contemplated signing a professional contract with Anaheim after last winter but decided to return to UMD for his senior season. \nNow, he's ready to lead and learn during his last hurrah at UMD. \n\"Whether I lead by example in the room, do the right things, or say the right things, it's part of the game,\" he said. \"I think that's a good thing to learn. It's going to help me grow as an individual, and hopefully I can help my teammates at the same time.\" \nUMD will open the 2015-16 season Oct. 9 at home against Bemidji State. Faceoff is set for 7:07 p.m., and that game can be seen in the Northland on the My 9 Sports Network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:56:15.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
