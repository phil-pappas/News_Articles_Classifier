(Photo: Olson, Grace) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhile the Ravens took on the Browns at home this past Sunday, a few special figures from Baltimore's football past made the trip to M&T Stadium and watched on with reminiscent eyes. \nHalfback Lenny Moore, defensive end Gino Marchetti, and wide receiver Raymond Berry, members of the dominating Baltimore Colts teams of the 1950s and 1960s, joined football greats of the present during halftime for a special ring presentation put on by the NFL Hall of Fame. Because rings are now constructed with a lot more \"bling\", the NFL launched an initiative to present Hall of Fame players with new hardware, constructed with nearly two carats of diamonds arranged in the shape of a football. \nMoore, Marchetti and Berry played a large role in building a meaningful football presence in Baltimore, playing their way to Super Bowl championships in 1958 and 1959. For that reason, they requested that the presentation be had in Maryland, rather than in Indianapolis. \nBefore kickoff, I spoke with NFL Hall of Fame President David Baker about the importance of the players' return. \nFormer Baltimore Colt Lenny Moore runs around the end in a 1960 game against the Rams.
