Posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015 9:50 pm After Duke loss, Virginia Tech's bowl streak is looking dim Ricky LaBlue, editor in chief   1 comment \nWith no margin of error left, Virginia Tech needed a win against No. 23 Duke on Saturday. \nThe Hokies needed to salvage their season, and help the ailing prospects of a bowl game for the 23rd straight season. Instead, Tech suffered one of the toughest losses at Lane Stadium in a while, losing 45-43 in 4 OT. \nVirginia Tech played Duke even for most of the night. Tech scored a touchdown to open the fourth OT, as running back Travon McMillian capped his career night with a 1 yard touchdown. McMillian finished with 142 rushing yards and two touchdowns. \nHowever, after the second overtime, teams must go for a two-point conversion. Tech drew up a pass to wide receiver Isaiah Ford, but the pass was batted away. \nDuke tied it on an easy, wide-open touchdown pass to tight end Erich Schneider, and converted the two-point attempt when quarterback Thomas Sirk gutted the Hokies on the ground one last time. \n“That was unacceptable,” said defensive end Ken Ekanem. “We haven’t been playing well. We haven’t played at a high level and it’s just frustrating.” \nThe defense struggled to stop Duke on offense, allowing 449 yards of total offense and 109 rushing yards to Sirk alone. It was the third time this season the Virginia Tech defense has allowed over 100 yards rushing to opposing quarterbacks. \n“We don’t play defense as well as we’re accustomed to around here, and I’m not going to make any excuses for that,” said head coach Frank Beamer. “To me, you look out there on the field, and there are some pretty good players. All the freshmen playing in the secondary, those guys are replacing two guys that probably would have ended up in the NFL.” \n“There wasn’t anything that they did that we didn’t practice,” said defensive coordinator Bud Foster. \nQuarterback Michael Brewer, who returned to the starting lineup after fracturing his collarbone against Ohio State, said this loss stings more than others. \n“It’s tough,” Brewer said. “I don’t know that I’ve ever been a part of a more heart-breaking loss than this.” \nVirginia Tech football is at a very important part of its existence. Beamer, who built the program basically from nothing, is in danger of missing the 6-win mark for the first time since 1992. The Hokies have been very mediocre since 2012, and even though the coaching staff glows constantly about the young talent on the team every season, it isn’t translating to wins. \n“It’s a growing period,” Beamer said. “You look at the receivers we’ve got and McMillian, I think the future looks extremely bright.” \nFor those fans thinking they’ve heard something similar to that, you aren’t wrong. \n“I look forward to the future because I think we are going to be pretty good,” Beamer said after last season’s dreadful 30-6 loss to Miami. \nAnother ACC loss at Lane Stadium only contributes to the growing sentiment that it’s time Beamer step down and let someone else run the program. \n“I understand the importance of winning, there’s no question about that,” Beamer said. “We’re going to do the best job we can and worry about Boston College. I’ve got to put all my emphasis on what I can control and right now that’s getting ready for Boston College and getting a football team playing with a lot of effort, a lot of heart and had a tough loss and getting them back ready to roll.” \nSomehow, some way, Virginia Tech needs to rally. The Hokies can forget about an ACC Coastal Championship – even in the terrible Coastal, three losses are too much. Now, the primary, and only objective, needs to be finding a way to win three more games. \nTech’s next two games are sort of forgiving. They play Boston College next weekend, a team that has impressed on defense but has struggled to move the ball on offense. After a bye week, Tech plays Georgia Tech on the road as well, and the Yellow Jackets have been more than disappointing this season. \nNorth Carolina is the last home game on the schedule, but the Tar Heels are 6-1 and look much more impressive than the Hokies. Virginia is the last game on the schedule, and that game is always close nowadays. The Hokies must win three of these four games to become bowl-eligible. \n“We’ve just got to find a way to rally the team and come together,” Brewer said. “At this point, we’re playing for a bowl game, and obviously we want to go to the best bowl game we can. In order to do that, you’ve got to keep winning.” Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Brewer (12) slides for a first down. Ben Weidlich / Collegiate Times \n“We don’t want to be the team to end that streak,” said cornerback Brandon Facyson. “We’ve got to get back to work.” \nAt least for Virginia Tech, Beamer hasn’t lost his will to compete. \n“I’m a big believer that when things are tough, real tough, if you’ve got good kids in your program, rally and come back and there may not be enough wins, but if guys come back and play hard – we’ve got some big ball games against rival opponents. Coming back from disappointment and showing a little character and being relentless, those things go a long way in life.” \n“If a guy doesn’t give in when things are looking bleak, and all of us have had that, if you don’t give in, then you’ve got a chance,” Beamer said. “If you give in, I pretty much know how the story is going to turn out. That’s us right there.” \nEven though the ACC Championship Game is out of reach, the Hokies have the right mindset. Unfortunately for them, it takes more than mindset to win. They need to execute, or risk being known as the team that ended the streak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:57:42.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
