After scrambling back from that precipice to reach the American League Championship Series, it must have felt like a reprieve, since Game 1 was just the beginning of what promised to be a long series with the Kansas City Royals —important, yes, but still just an early skirmish in a lengthy war.\nBut two previously minor concerns now threaten to become major ones for the Jays: the health of third baseman Edwin Encarnacion and the extended slump of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki , and they could significantly change the course of this series. The issues raised their ugly heads in the Jays’ 5–0 Game 1 loss to the Royals. Encarnacion had to leave the game when he re-aggravated an injury to his right middle finger that has plagued him since August. X-rays were negative, but he was diagnosed with a ligament strain and his availability for Game 2 on Saturday afternoon is in doubt. Suddenly the Blue Jays, favored by many to win the World Series, have something of a crisis on their hands.\n“It swelled up a little more than we’ve seen it in the past,” Toronto manager John Gibbons said of Encarnacion’s finger. “Usually in a day or two it calms down and he’s able to get through it. It’s an early game tomorrow, so hopefully he’ll be able to go.”\nThe Jays surely could have used Encarnacion in the eighth inning when his spot in the batting order came up with two on and one out with Kansas City leading 3–0. But Gibbons had to send up pinch-hitter Justin Smoak, who fouled out to first, followed by a Chris Colabello ground out that ended the Jays’ only real threat. Encarnacion’s further absence would be especially damaging, since Tulowitzki continues to be mostly missing in action. The high-priced shortstop hasn’t hit much at all since the Jays acquired him from Colorado in July—he’s slashing just .239/.317/.380 with five home runs and 17 RBIs in 41 games with Toronto—with the notable exception of a three-run homer that helped Toronto avoid a sweep against Texas in the American League Division Series. He was slumping even before he suffered a cracked shoulder blade in a collision with centerfielder Kevin Pillar in September, but he seems to be further hampered by the lingering effects of the injury.\nMLB Strong Volquez outing lifts Royals past Blue Jays in Game 1 of ALCS by Cliff Corcoran", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/SI_PhilTaylor"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:44:08.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
