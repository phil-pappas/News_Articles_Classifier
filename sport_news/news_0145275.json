They have a big back and their quarterback runs well,” Pace coach William Deen said. “We’ve got to keep them in check.” \nThe Redskins, led by Amonte Bowen and Edward Dougherty, have run for nearly 1,300 yards and 16 touchdowns this season. \n“It’s no secret we run the ball a lot, so we try to open up the passing game to make us a little more two-dimensional instead of one-dimensional,” Donna High coach Ramiro Leal said. \nThe Vikings know they need to get their own offense going and limit the number of possessions Donna High gets. Pace has averaged just 167 yards and 11 points this season, the fewest in the district. \n“Offensively, we have to move the football and not leave our defense on the field like last week,” Deen said. “We’ve made some adjustments that will hopefully put us in a good position.” \nDistrict 32-6A \nHawks, Lobos winless, but confident heading into matchup \nHARLINGEN — Harlingen South and Lopez are without a win heading into tonight’s District 32-6A matchup at Boggus Stadium, so something’s got to give. \nWith the Lobos struggling this season to put up points and stop opposing offenses, the Hawks are hoping to get some sort of momentum and show they are better than what their record says. \nSouth’s losses to No. 5 Weslaco High and No. 6 Brownsville Veterans were by a combined 11 points. While Harlingen South coach Lanny Wilson isn’t looking for sympathy, he knows his team has no reason to hang its head. \n“I told my teams that the teams we’ve lost to are a combined 11-1 on the year. It’s not an excuse, but it’s a fact,” Wilson said. “We have to correct things that aren’t going well, but at the same time you have to be realistic. We’ve played some really good teams. \n“Losing the first district game is not a season killer. Veterans is a good team.” \nThis week, the matchup is favorable for the Hawks, who boast the fifth-best offense (369 ypg) in the district and are led by quarterback Brandon Villarreal, receiver Darren Perez — who caught a pair of touchdowns from Villarreal during last week’s loss to Brownsville Veterans — and running back Steven Rodriguez. \nThose playmakers could have big days against Lopez, which ranks second to last in defense (366 yards allowed per game). The Lobos also are on a 13-game losing streak dating back to last season after falling to Los Fresnos 46-7 on Saturday. \nDespite their shortcomings, the Lobos feel that they, too, are playing better than their winless record shows. \n“We’re going to win and we’re going to continue to do it the way I want to do it, and that’s the way we did it (Saturday),” Lobo coach Jason Starkey told the Herald this week. “We’re confident for a reason, we played pretty dagum good football and we’re a tough team. \n“I’m excited for our last six games and excited for our chances.\" \nMark Molina contributed to this report. \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
