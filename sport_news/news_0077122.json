He wasn’t able to break loose on the run, but that’s a very, very good, fast defense.” \nJackson’s throwing helped U of L gain some traction on a day it didn’t make a big dent with the run. \nHe finished with 32 yards on 19 runs – an average of 1.7 yards per carry – with a long of 10 yards. That output was worsened by a total of minus-27 yards on five sacks, which tied a season high for Louisville (2-4, 1-2 ACC). \nJackson’s 32 rushing yards were still a high for U of L, which ran for 99 in all while giving Brandon Radcliff, L.J. Scott and Reggie Bonnafon, a quarterback who played tailback exclusively in this game, 11 combined carries. \nFSU coach Jimbo Fisher was pleased to limit Jackson’s ground attack. \n“I think the defense played real well, especially on the quarterback,” he said. “That guy, he never really beat us with his legs a lot in that game. We pressured him, got sacks. He made some scrambles, made some plays, but we got him on the ground a lot.” Sullivan | Effort lagging in Louisville loss \nThe most notable hit was on a crushing blindside sack from safety Derwin James, who jarred the ball loose from Jackson and helped position FSU for its third touchdown of the third quarter. \nPetrino said he would like to have seen Jackson show some more general awareness of the blitz on that play, and Jackson said he needs to hold onto the ball better or get rid of it quicker next time. \n“He needs to learn and feel it and understand what to do about getting the ball out,” Petrino said. \nJackson certainly got the ball out successfully several times to Quick, who caught five passes for a season-high 130 yards while leading U of L in receiving for the third straight game. \nWhile U of L used an up-tempo offense early on, Jackson found Quick, who plays primarily as a slot receiver, wide-open over the middle for consecutive completions of 48 and 18 yards - the latter being the game’s first touchdown. \nJackson said Quick, a Trinity High School product, had predicted in practice that he would get some favorable matchups and for Jackson to find him. \n“Quick is very exciting to practice with, to play with, and I can’t say I didn’t see (his big day) coming,” wide receiver Jaylen Smith said, “because all week in practice we knew where the mismatches were. \n“With Quick being in the slot, we knew where their better cover guys were and where he could get a matchup with maybe a free safety or a strong safety or a linebacker, and we took advantage of it all afternoon.” Petrino disagrees with targeting call on Brown \nJackson also found Quick in the end zone for a 19-yard TD in the third quarter to cap an impressive drive that gave U of L the lead back 14-13 after FSU had seized momentum. \nThen early in the fourth quarter, with FSU well ahead, Jackson and Quick hooked up on a pretty 39-yard pass reeled in by Quick in the back left corner of the end zone. \n“He just ran a great route and went as fast as he possibly could and played the ball in the air,” Petrino said, noting that tracking down high, deep throws has caused trouble for Quick before. “… But he did a great job playing it, catching the ball, keeping a foot inbounds.\" \nPetrino didn’t seem to fault Jackson too much for his interception in the third quarter, another deep ball intended for Quick, who looked open at the time Jackson released the pass but tripped while running against FSU’s defensive backs. Petrino said he thought Jackson threw the ball to the right spot, but with Quick down, the Seminoles’ Javien Elliott caught it for Jackson’s fifth pick of the year. \nJackson said Quick told him he got pushed in the back on the play, and Smith said he thought pass interference could have been called. \nSmith, another true freshman and Jackson’s roommate, tied Quick for the team high with five catches (for 38 yards) and was one of seven players to catch a ball from Jackson. \n“I feel as if Lamar kind of had something to prove because a lot of people didn’t realize he could throw as well as he could,” Smith said. “We always knew during the (skeleton passing) and all the other (drills) we did during the summer and during camp that Lamar had a great arm and he could always sling it. So it was nice to see him throw it out there.” \nSteve Jones can be reached at (502) 582-7176 and swjones1@courier-journal.com. 17 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1RP9MhX TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:03:45.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
