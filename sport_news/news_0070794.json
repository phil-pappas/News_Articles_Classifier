What does it take to create a patch of land that you want to revisit in your mind?\nIt starts with a site that, with talent and horticulture skills, is transformed into a spiritually and emotionally inspiring place.\nLandscape architect Richard Hartlage of Seattle's Land Morphology is a recognized master at using carefully chosen landscape structures, plantings and art to create garden spaces that stop you in your tracks and take your mind off everything else.\nAnother feature that encourages garden visitors to stay to take it all in: \"Quietude is essential, of course,\" to make those moments precious, Hartlage writes in his blog .\nHartlage will explain the elements of a memorable landscape at a lecture from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 22 at the Portland Art Museum .\nThe lecture is part of a series organized by the Leach Botanical Garden and is included with admission to the Portland Art Museum, which has a collection of 39 landscape masterpieces -- the U.S. debut of \"Seeing Nature: Landscape Masterworks from the Paul G. Allen Family Collection\" -- through Jan. 10.\nHartlage's talk is called \"Thin Places: Gardens That Move You\" and will focus on two of his projects: Silas Mountsier's garden in Nutley, New Jersey, and the 8-acre In Situ Estate in Redding, Connecticut.\nAccording to event organizers, \"thin places\" can refer to the line between the mortal and the spiritual world. They \"can be beautiful or austere, opulent or profane but they always transport us.\"\nIn Hartlage's blog, he writes that not all projects can be a thin place. It depends on the site's qualities.\n\"Given the opportunity and correct set of circumstances, however, creating thin places has been one of the most profound gifts that has been offered to me,\" he writes. \"I have come to believe that beauty can be transcendent, and that is the ideal we all must aspire to.\"\nHartlage's stellar projects include estates and Seattle public gardens like the Chihuly Gardens and Glass , the vegetation management plan for the Seattle Center and the Elisabeth C. Miller Botanical Garden. He also designed the New Herb and Vegetable Garden at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens.\nHe has contributed to five books on horticulture and design, including \"Bold Visions for the Garden,\" a collection of his essays and photography, and is currently working on two new books due out in 2016.\n-- - Janet Eastman\njeastman@oregonian.com\n503-799-8739\n@janeteastman\nStay in the loop.
