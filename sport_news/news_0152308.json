But the first one drifted to the right, the second to the left. \nBefore he missed the 53-yarder, Colts coach Chuck Pagano called time. Myers said he heard the whistle, but kicked it even though he knew it wouldn’t count. \n“I didn’t want to do something stupid and pull off,’’ he said. He said the kick after the whistle had nothing to do with the miss. \nMyers said he won’t make changes in his style because he hit both kicks solidly. \nThe Jaguars are sticking with Myers after trading Josh Scobee to Pittsburgh to open the door for the young kicker who was in the Arena League last year. Scobee struggled in Pittsburgh and was cut last week. \n“I need to get back to the way I do things and put that behind me and think about this week in practice,’’ Myers said. “It’s [the misses] already in my rearview mirror.” \nHolder Bryan Anger , who’s also the team’s punter, said Myers is handling the misses well. \n“You can’t let things faze you,’’ he said. “If something like that gets to you, then you crumble. You have to have a strong head and move forward. You can’t get too up or too down. You’ve got to stay in the middle. There’s no reason to change anything. He’s been hitting the ball well.” \nQB’s growing pains \nBlake Bortles understands what it takes to be a good quarterback. \n“As a quarterback in this league, there are times when you have to be able to will your team to victory,’’ he said. “I definitely need to improve — I’ll always need to improve. But there has been some growth and some improvement.” \nOf his performance so far, he said, “Not good enough, obviously.” \nWhen he was asked how he describes how a quarterback can will his team to victory, he said, “Just being able to put your team in a spot to win.’’ \n“Whether you played bad all game — and you see it every week — somebody doesn’t play well the entire game, and at the end of the game they get a two-minute drill and an opportunity and they’re able to come through,’’ he said. \nOf a quarterback willing his team to win, offensive coordinator Greg Olson said, “I think that’s part of the position for any great player.’’ \n“He strives to be great,” Olson said. “That’s a very admirable quality to have in a quarterback, and that’s certainly one that you need in a winning organization. He has to feel that I will carry this team on my shoulders. It is coming. We’ve got to finish some games, but his starts have been impressive through four games.’’ \nBortles had two possessions in his first NFL overtime Sunday. The first one ended in a punt and the second one when Myers missed the 48-yard field goal attempt. \nBortles misfired on two passes (one was batted down) before the punt and on a second-down pass before the missed field goal. \nHe also said he threw to the wrong receiver on third down from the Colts two in the first quarter, resulting in a field goal. Marcedes Lewis was open, but Bortles forced an incomplete pass to Allen Hurns . \n“It’s little things like that,’’ he said, “Staying true to a read that you’ve been doing since [training] camp.’’ \nBortles will be making his 18th start in Tampa Bay. He’s 4-13 and still looking for his first road victory. \nInjury report \nEight Jaguars didn’t practice Wednesday. They were DE Chris Clemons (knee), WR Hurns (thigh/ankle), WR Marqise Lee (hamstring), LB John Lotulelei (concussion), LB Paul Posluszny (ankle), RB Denard Robinson (knee) and S James Sample (shoulder). Lee and Robinson didn’t play in Indianapolis and the condition of the other six will be updated later this week. \nDT Sen’Derrick Marks , sidelined since the end of last year with a torn ACL, was limited again, and coach Gus Bradley said he wasn’t sure if Marks has a chance to play. \nEtc. \nBradley said his message Wednesday was about getting the details right, adding the team had a “very, very good practice.” … Bradley spent three years as an assistant coach in Tampa under Jon Gruden from 2006-2008 and told the Tampa Bay media in a conference call that he learned from his time there. In his last year, the Bucs were 9-3, lost their last four and Gruden was fired. “It was a good run until we hit that wall,’’ Bradley said. It worked out well for Bradley — he was then hired by Seattle, the springboard for him getting the Jaguars job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:47:57.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
