Transit Tech High School stands on a dead-end street in East New York, but its basketball team isn't planning to stop short for anything.\nAfter winning the Brooklyn 'A' West title with a 17-1 record, the top-seeded Express defeated No. 8 Midwood, 47-42, at St. John's on Saturday to earn a spot in the PSAL 'A' semifinals. The Express will meet No. 12 Adams at Hunter College on Wednesday for the right to play for the A title on March 17.\n\"If we're going to continue to advance, we're going to have to keep playing as a total team,\" said Michael Perazzo, Transit Tech's fifth-year coach.\nTransit is led by four seniors, three of whom have been playing together for at least three years.\nThe Express combines point guard Al Alexander and Garfield Burchette (the team's scoring leader at 16.2 ppg) to form a formidable backcourt. Both players live in neighboring Brownsville, and say they're \"like brothers, on and off the court.\"\nTransit's front line includes a pair of 6-5 forwards, Benjamin Washington and Yuseff Carr, who combined to haul in 20.6 rebounds per game this year.\nThe Express has been flying this year, but that success follows several years of start-and-stop progress. Before the PSAL realigned its divisions, establishing an 'AA' division for its most competitive teams this year, Transit Tech went a combined 12-30 from 2003-06.\nThe growing pains provided invaluable lessons.\n\"We were playing Boys & Girls, Banneker, Robeson, Canarsie, South Shore and Jefferson during those years,\" Perazzo said. \"We still feel like we can play with them, but that experience definitely helped us, when the PSAL moved us to the A.\"\nTransit Tech hasn't been the only team to benefit from the realignment. After spending the last several years playing second fiddle in Queens, Edison defeated perennial powerhouse Cardozo and later shocked Campus Magnet to capture the borough championship.\nThe Inventors entered the A playoffs seeded behind only Transit Tech, survived the tournament's two early rounds and won their quarterfinal matchup against Sheepshead Bay on Saturday, 51-45, setting up Wednesday's semifinal game against No. 2 Curtis.\nIf Transit Tech and Edison win their respective semifinal matchups, they'll play for the 'A' title at Hunter College on Saturday.\n\"I haven't really seen them play, but they have to be good,\" Edison coach John Ulmer said of the Express. \"It would be great if we can meet in the final.\"\nThe Express had a scare in the first round of the playoffs, when starting point guard Alexander - whom Perazzo calls the team's \"heart and soul\" - suffered a level-two ankle sprain in the third quarter against New Utrecht and had to be rushed to the hospital.\nDespite feeling lingering effects of the injury, Alexander returned to score 13 points and lead the Express to a 61-54 second-round win over Newtown last Tuesday.\nTransit Tech's fifth-year coach Michael Perazzo. \"This is the playoffs,\" Alexander said. \"I have to be out there.\"\nFor Alexander, 2006-07 has been a season of proving to teammates that he's back; the senior sat out 12 games because of poor grades last year.\n\"I got too comfortable as a basketball player and took my teachers for granted,\" Alexander said. \"I started working hard again to change that, and be there for the team.\"\nHis teammates have noticed.\n\"He's so focused,\" Burchette said. \"He could be blindfolded and find me open on the court.\"\nBut Alexander isn't the only Transit Tech player trying to showcase his dedication.\nCarr wakes up at 4 a.m. to start getting ready to make the journey to East New York from the Upper West Side. He has to ride two trains to arrive on time for his 7:40 a.m. English class.\n\"It can get very tiring and my parents were concerned about me going to East New York every day, but we all got used to it,\" Carr said. \"I didn't just come here for athletics.\"\nCarr applied to Transit Tech to enroll in its electrical installation program. The school's thematic curriculum offers hands-on classes and workshops.\n\"I want to be an electrician,\" Carr said. \"They'll show us how to install a light fixture. It's interesting.\"\nThe Express has managed to do nearly everything right on the court this year. The team's success has even caught the attention of the school's track team, which sprints after hours in the school's empty hallways outside the gym.\n\"The track coach tries to steal our players; we catch him peeking into our practices,\" Perazzo said jokingly.\n\"I'm always looking to see who they have,\" responded a laughing Sydney McIntosh, the track coach. It's what I have to do.\"\nTransit Tech principal Larry Kalvar says that basketball, track and the school's other athletic programs have helped shield participants from the perils of East New York's no-nonsense streets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:11:17.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
