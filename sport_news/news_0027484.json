Dominic Abui Pretino equalized with South Sudan's first goal in World Cup qualifying, giving the world's newest nation hope ahead of the return leg in Mauritania next week. \nSouth Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, and was admitted by FIFA in 2012. \nLast month, the South Sudanese secured their first ever victory in a competitive game when they beat Equatorial Guinea 1-0 in an African Cup qualifier. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:41:37.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
