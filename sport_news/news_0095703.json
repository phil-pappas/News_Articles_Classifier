It’s a big job up front, so we have to be very good there.” \nSouth Africa’s overwhelming history in this matchup gives it the edge, but a Gatland-coached team can never be counted out. \nSouth Africa: Willie le Roux, JP Pietersen, Jesse Kriel, Damian De Allende, Bryan Habana, Handre Pollard, Fourie du Preez (captain); Duane Vermeulen, Schalk Burger, Francois Louw, Lood de Jager, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Bismarck du Plessis, Tendai Mtawarira.
