Lightning already forced Friday afternoon’s practice to be called off. \nDrivers completed a wet, hour-long practice session Saturday morning. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes had the fastest lap, topping Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel. \nMore heavy rain moved in, forcing a three-hour delay before officials postponed qualifying until Sunday. The worst weather is forecast to move from the area overnight, although it could still be raining when the drivers return. \nHamilton is chasing his second consecutive world championship and third overall. He can clinch the title Sunday if he outscores Vettel by nine points and Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg by two.
