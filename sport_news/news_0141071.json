The longest belongs to Gene Mingo, who galloped 82 yards for a TD against Oakland on Oct. 5, 1962. \nWatch out, C.J. Anderson, Hillman may be closing in on your starting job. Anderson has three carries for seven yards on the afternoon. Hillman? One for 72 — a pretty good average.

Lynch and Mebane had both been listed as questionable after Saturday's final practice. \nLynch injured one of his hamstrings late in the first half of Seattle's 26-0 win over Chicago last Sunday. Lynch was hurt catching a fourth-down pass just before halftime. Seattle coach Pete Carroll said Lynch had an MRI on the injury earlier this week but did not elaborate. It will be just the second game Lynch has missed since joining the Seahawks in 2010 and the first since the 2011 season.

Heading into the game Sunday, Vinatieri had 994 points. Vinatieri was already one of two players in the NFL to score 800 or more points with two teams.

It's the ninth time a Chiefs kicker has made five in a game.

He rushed for 141 yards and three touchdowns in last week's victory at Dallas, and he has three touchdowns so far Sunday against the Houston Texas.

He had a 6-yard touchdown in the third quarter. \nFreeman has 70 rushing yards midway through the third quarter, plus five catches for 81 receiving yards. \nThe unbeaten Falcons are seeking only the fourth 4-0 start in franchise history.

The Chiefs' top cornerback is guarding A.J. Green, who has six catches for 78 yards in the first half. Green is coming off a 10-catch, 227-yard game at Baltimore. \nNo surprise that the Bengals lead 14-12 at halftime. They've outscored opponents 66-18 in the first half of games this season and haven't allowed a touchdown. \n— Joe Kay reporting from Cincinnati Indianapolis Colts' Adam Vinatieri (4) and Pat McAfee (1) celebrate after Vinatieri kicked a 54-yard field goal during the first half of an NFL football game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015, in Indianapolis.

(AP Photo/Joe Mahoney) \nEagles kicker Caleb Sturgis missed a 33-yard field goal try on the last play of the first half, leaving the Redskins ahead 13-0. \nPhiladelphia's offense came in struggling, and Sunday has been no different so far. The Eagles' first three possessions each ended with a punt, the fourth ended with a fumble, and the fifth — after a 45-yard punt return by Darren Sproles — ended with Sturgis' miss. \nEagles quarterback Sam Bradford is 5 for 10 for 74 yards. He's been sacked three times. \nIn Washington's previous home game, a 24-10 victory over St. Louis in Week 2, the Redskins led 17-0 at halftime. \n— Howard Fendrich reporting from Landover, Maryland \n2 p.m. \nWith three catches for 24 yards in the first quarter against Buffalo, Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. set the NFL record for most yards receiving through his first 16 games. \nBeckham reached 1,598 yards receiving thanks to an 8-yard catch with 6:39 left in the first quarter. That's 5 more yards than the previous record set by Houston's Bill Groman over the 1960-61 seasons. \nFor the Bills, starting left tackle Cordy Glenn was escorted to the locker room after hurting his left ankle. His return is considered questionable. Buffalo is already missing starting left guard John Miller (groin). \n— John Wawrow reporting from Orchard Park, New York \n1:45 p.m. \nWe have a DeMarco Murray sighting. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles running back weaved his way to a 30-yard gain on his first carry Sunday against the Washington Redskins — by far his longest run of the season. \nMurray, who led the NFL in rushing for the Cowboys last season then signed as a free agent with the Eagles, entered this game with a grand total of 11 yards on 21 carries this season in two games. His best effort had been worth all of 9 yards. \nHe missed last week's game with a hamstring injury. \n— Howard Fendrich reporting from Landover, Maryland \n___ \n1:40 p.m. \nA 54-yard field goal in the first quarter Sunday against the Jaguars gave Colts' kicker Adam Vinatieri a leg up in the record books. \nWith the field goal, Vinatieri moved up in both the NFL and Colts record books. Vinatieri passed John Carney for sole possession of fourth place in NFL history in field goals made. It also put him ahead of Mike Vanderjagt for most points scored in Colts history. Vinatieri currently has 997 points. \nOne more field goal on Sunday will make him the first player in NFL history to score 1,000 points with two teams. He is one of two players in the NFL to score 800 or more points with two different teams. \n— Corey Elliot reporting from Indianapolis \n___ \n1:25 p.m. \nTop overall draft pick Jameis Winston is off to a tough start, losing a fumble on Tampa Bay's second play against Carolina and having his first pass intercepted and returned for a touchdown. \nThe fumble — on a snap in the rain — set up a field goal. Josh Norman's interception and 46-yard return up the left sideline gave the Panthers a 10-0 lead. \n— Fred Goodall reporting from Tampa Bay, Florida \n___ \n1:20 p.m. \nNew York Giants left tackle Ereck Flowers aggravated an ankle injury on the opening drive and his return is questionable. \nFlowers was limited in practice this week and was listed as questionable on Friday. Justin Pugh shifted from left guard to play left tackle, while John Jerry entered the game to fill Pugh's spot. \n— John Wawrow reporting from Orchard Park, New York \n___ \n1:15 p.m. \nChicago Bears center Will Montgomery has hobbled off the field with a left ankle injury on the team's first drive against Oakland. \nMontgomery was blocking on a running play when teammate Charles Leno Jr. dove into the back of his leg. \nThe Bears say Montgomery will miss the rest of the game. \nMatt Slauson slid over to center from left guard, and the Bears went on to score on a 7-yard touchdown reception by wide receiver Eddie Royal. \n— Jay Cohen in Chicago", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:00:58.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
