The league coaches gave the Gorillas 128 points. Missouri Western was just four points behind the Gorillas in fifth with 124 points. Following the Griffons were Washburn, Central Oklahoma, Missouri Southern, Lindenwood, Northeasern State, Lincoln, Nebraska-Kearney, Northwest Missouri and Southwest Baptist.\n\"I think fourth is a very fair pick for us,\" Pitt State head coach Lane Lord said. \"We had some very good players graduate and have a lot of new players on our team, so our potential is really unknown at this point. I know that we have great talent and leadership returning in our juniors and seniors, Paige Lungwitz, Hadyn Herlocker, Cathy Brugman and Kylie Gafford. They know what it takes to win and will keep our team in that top third of the conference.\"\nThe Gorillas will play exhibition games at Kansas on Sunday, November 1 and Kansas State on Monday, November 9 before opening the regular season in North Dakota as part of a MIAA/Northern Sun Challenge. The team will play its first home game and conference opener on Wednesday, December 2 at 5:30 p.m. against Northeastern State.\nGet a full preview of the 2015-16 season from Coach Lord and all the other MIAA coaches through the MIAA Virtual Media Day link on the right side of the page.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:55:42.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
