This year my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer, so that phrase means more to me now than it ever has in the past.”The seminar will focus on practical self-defense techniques, but Sanders, who was crowned women’s bantamweight champion of the International Kickboxing Federation World Classic in 2014 and 2015, will place special focus on how women can defend against and escape an attack if they find themselves overpowered.“I personally believe Jiu Jitsu provides the best possible self-defense techniques for women,” Sanders said. “I want these ladies to feel strong and capable if they ever find themselves with their back on the ground having to defend against an attacker.”The seminar is open to all women of any age who want to acquire the skills and develop the confidence needed to defend themselves against potentially larger and stronger opponents.“The most valuable skill I have acquired from training martial arts is confidence,” Sanders said. “It is empowering when you discover what your body and mind are truly capable of, and I want to give that gift to every woman and girl that I meet.”The “Fight like a Girl” seminar will be held at Forca Martial Arts and Fitness at 2300 West Main St. in Russellville from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday. No experience or reservations are needed.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:16:30.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
