(Photo: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports)\nCONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE OAKLAND – Stephen Curry had no shortage of endorsement deals even before he won the NBA’s MVP award, captured the championship and stole hearts of millions of fans who adore him and his humble ways.\nBut Stephen Colbert was absolutely right when he surmised recently that the Golden State Warriors point guard would be a perfect fit for one more sponsor: Uber.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Western Conference preview\nAs the witty late-night talk show host explained in one of Curry’s many high-profile appearances during his summer-long victory lap, Curry has revolutionized the basketball industry in much the same way the transportation service has transformed the driving world. His shooting, above all else, has reached such spectacular levels that it sparked a league-wide movement toward the kind of small ball that is at its best when the long-range game is prioritized and perfected. The taxi drivers might not like it — here’s looking at you, Byron Scott and Phil Jackson — but even they have to admit it’s the wave of basketball’s future.\nThe remarkable part about Curry is that he has taken it so much further than that. Imagine Uber expanding into the food service market, the news business and the social media sphere, and you’ll get a sense of how versatile and impactful he has become.\nBut as the Warriors begin their title defense against many teams that are coming back stronger than before, it all raises this natural question about Curry: How can he top last season? The truth, his rivals will be disappointed to hear, is it seems entirely possible — even likely — that he will.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA power rankings: Finalists at top until they get knocked off\nHere’s why:\nFixing turnover problem\nSure, it was charming and comical to hear about how Curry would give his mother, Sonya, $100 for each turnover past his second after every game last season. And as Colbert pointed out, there’s a silver-lining factor there when a bad day at the office results in doing a nice thing for the woman who brought you into this world.\nBut rest assured, the always-charitable 27-year-old wants this particular donation to come to an end. The lone downside to his wildly entertaining style has been his occasional propensity to be careless with the ball, and it’s safe to assume another year of experience should make it that much easier to focus on fixing this problem area.\nCurry averaged 3.1 turnovers a game last season, ranking him ninth overall in the league, tops on the Warriors and fifth among all point guards who qualified behind Russell Westbrook, John Wall, Michael Carter-Williams, and Eric Bledsoe. In terms of turnovers per minute-played, his mark of .095 was the second worst of Curry’s five full seasons. He was even worse in the playoffs, averaging 3.9 a game, third overall behind LeBron James and James Harden in 21 games.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA Fast Break: This team gets no respect\nThe goal, it would seem, should be to channel his inner Chris Paul. The Los Angeles Clippers star averaged 2.3 turnovers a game last season to go with his league-leading 10.2 assists, giving him a 4.41 assist-to-turnover ratio that not only led the league but was well ahead of Curry’s 2.49 (22nd among point guards).\n“I’m going to be smarter (this season),” Curry said. “That is the key for me, is to continue to try to make the best decisions with the ball as a point guard, get my teammates involved, feeling the flow of the game and just watching film and learning from last season.”\nSays Klay Thompson, his Splash Brother/fellow All-Star in the Warriors’ backcourt: “You would think (Curry) is on top of his game right now, but there are still areas he can improve, which is hard to think about because he’s so well-rounded in every part of his game.”\nThe coaching factor\nIt's still amazing how quickly Curry clicked with coach Steve Kerr last season, especially considering the drama that surrounded the Warriors’ firing of coach Mark Jackson two summers ago and the fact that the former coach had such a close relationship with his star player. The Warriors wound up with the league’s second-best offense (behind the Clippers) and a three-point attack that finished with the third-highest total in league history (883, with the highest three-point percentage, .398, of that top five group). Curry set the single-season record for threes (286) for the second time in his career.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Is Eastern Conference the Cavaliers' to lose?\nBut there was still a getting-to-know-you period for Curry and Kerr, one replaced with all the momentum and still-growing chemistry that comes with their wondrous debut together. And lest anyone think that effect is minimized by the recent revelation that Kerr would be out indefinitely while he recovers from his two offseason back surgeries, the Warriors are optimistic he’ll be back on the bench before the regular season. There is an element of unknown this season, as Kerr will start the season on the sideline because of complications caused by his offseason back surgery and Curry will thus work with interim coach Luke Walton. The Warriors' optimistic outlook, however, is that Kerr should be back before long.\nThe more significant subplot is the recent addition of future Hall of Famer Steve Nash as a player development consultant, which will help Curry, the self-described “sponge.” It was a brilliant stroke by the Warriors, who saw shades of Nash’s game in Curry’s in 2009 when they took him seventh overall out of Davidson. Former coach Don Nelson and then-general manager Larry Riley agreed Curry’s passing skills were far greater than folks gave him credit for at the time. With Nash having retired amid endless injuries, his loss is their gain.\n“I’m looking forward to chop it up with Coach Nash, a guy that can hopefully — as we watch film and talk and have that back-and-forth — that will maybe show me things that I don’t see on the floor and be able to help me even more,” Curry said. “So it should be fun to go out and kind of show what we’re working on. I’m still going to be doing the same things I’ve been doing and not going to be a different player but just try to be better.”\nThe Father Time effect\nFor all of the focus on players getting slower and more injury-prone as they head into their 30s, there isn’t nearly enough talk about the golden age(s) that come before then. A player’s prime is a very real thing. And Curry is smack-dab in the middle of his.\nConsider this: By winning his first championship when he was 27 years, 3 months old, Curry beat great Michael Jordan to that feat by 13 months (Jordan was 28 years, 4 months when the Chicago Bulls won in 1991). And much like the Bulls then, the Warriors look fully capable of contending for many years to come.\n“I definitely see another level for (Curry),” Warriors small forward Draymond Green said. “I still think he’s just scratching the surface on how good he can be and how good he’s going to be. And it’s exciting to watch.”\nUSA TODAY\nCould Klay Thompson be an MVP candidate this year?\nWithout the title component, a similar discussion about a player’s prime can be had about fellow Western Conference stars on the Oklahoma City Thunder (Kevin Durant, 27, and Westbrook, 26), Clippers (Blake Griffin, 26, and DeAndre Jordan, 27) and Houston Rockets (Harden, 26). Not to mention the next-generation wave led by the San Antonio Spurs’ Kawhi Leonard, 24, and the New Orleans Pelicans’ Anthony Davis, 22. All of which makes the West so compelling.\nBut much like Durant and Westbrook with the Thunder, the Warriors should also reap the benefits of Curry continuing to grow with his fellow perimeter star. Thompson, who at times looked like the MVP candidate of the bunch last season, turned 25 in February.\n“It’s our fifth year together, (and) hopefully we’ve got another great five years in us,” Thompson said. “I wouldn’t rather play with anybody else in the backcourt. Honestly. He’s easy to follow, just because he leads by example every day and he puts the work in. So for me, it’s a privilege to play with Steph.”\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Adorable images of Riley Curry, Stephen Curry's daughter Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
