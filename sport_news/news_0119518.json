By Donald Heath Benedictine honored its seniors with a ceremony before the game Friday night, but once the whistle blew the underclassmen took over.\nSophomore running back Tyleek Collins ran for 201 yards and three touchdowns on just six carries and sophomore quarterback Nick Iannone threw for two scores as the top-ranked Cadets breezed past Jeff Davis 48-0 at T.A. Wright Stadium.\nBC (6-0, 3-0 Region 2-AA) won its 14th straight game and shut out the Yellow Jackets for the fourth consecutive year.\n“We have a young team — 115 kids (in the program) and only nine are seniors. The future looks good,” said Cadets coach Danny Britt, whose team built a 34-0 lead by halftime and played with a running clock in the second half.\nCollins, a 5-foot-9, 167-pounder with 4.47 speed in the 40-yard\ndash, did all his damage in the first half, scoring on runs of 60, 78 and 18 yards. He also caught one of Iannone’s touchdown passes on a 43-yard play.\n“I couldn’t have done it without my linemen. I give them all the credit,” Collins said.\nIannone completed 6 of 7 passes for 136 yards. His second score went to junior Nick Whitfield to complete the first drive of the third quarter.\nAnother junior, Wesley Kennedy, added a 25-yard TD run and sophomore Travis Blackshear had the final touchdown on a 44-yard run.\nThe Cadet defense held the Yellow Jackets to 138 yards — 79 after Jeff Davis’ initial drive of the game.\nBC has won its last four games this season by an average of 33.5 points.\n“What I want to see is the kids play to the best of their abilities. I think they did that tonight,” Britt said.\nThe Cadets entered Friday night’s homecoming game with shutout victories over Jeff Davis during the last three years — a combined score of 137-0 — after entering Class AA in 2012.\nLast season, BC won 42-0.\nDespite the lack of recent success against the Cadets, Jeff Davis won the coin toss and elected to defer, giving BC the ball first.\nTwo plays later, the Yellow Jackets regretted the decision.\nCollins began one of the best first-half performances of the year by taking a handoff, juking several defenders in tight quarters and sprinting 60 yards for a touchdown. Twenty-two seconds into the game, the Cadets had a 7-0 lead.\n“Sometimes watching him is like watching a video game,” Britt said. “You can’t touch him in a phone booth.”\nThe advantage grew to 13-0 on the first play of the second quarter when Collins got behind the Jeff Davis secondary and hauled in a 43-yard touchdown pass from Iannone.\nBC finished the quarter by scoring on its next three possessions to turn the game into a rout.\nKennedy capped a six-play, 59-yard drive with a 25-yard TD run to make it 20-0, and Collins scored on a 78 and 18-yard runs in the final 3:36 of the half.\nBC ran just 20 plays in the half for 366 yards — an 18.3-yard average. Collins had 201 yards on six carries and one catch for 43 yards.\nThe starters played sparingly in the second half. The Cadets finished with 501 offensive yards.\n“Our coaching staff keeps pushing us to do better,” Collins said. “We know it’s a long journey.”\nJeff Davis 0 0 0 0 — 0\nBC 7 27 7 7 — 48\nBC—Tyleek Collins 60 run (Jake Karesh kick)\nBC—T.Collins 43 pass from Nick Iannone (kick failed)\nBC—Wesley Kennedy 25 run (Karesh kick)\nBC—T.Collins 78 run (Karesh kick)\nBC—T.Collins 18 run (Karesh kick)\nBC—Nick Whitfield 12 pass from Iannone (Karesh kick)\nBC—Travis Blackshear 44 run (Karesh kick)", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:25:55.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
