I'm just happy I shot good.\" Peterson went on to shoot a 34 on the front and a 37 on the back at the Lincoln Elks Country Club, finishing the day with an even-par 71. He rattled off five birdies on the day. One shot back was Silver Streaks teammate Noah Benbow at 72, with three birdies on the day. \"I had a lot of good looks at birdies, but nothing fell,\" Benbow said. \"I putted well and am happy with how I played. A lot of positive thoughts going on.\" As far as his strategy, Benbow said, \"Hit fairways and go from there. One shot at a time. I knew I could play well.\" The cutoff mark for individuals was a 77 or lower of a non-qualifying team. Morton was the overall winner with a sizzling 301. Also advancing to state as a team were Normal U-High (314) and Dunlap (317). Rounding out the Galesburg individuals at the sectional were senior Mark Mangieri (91) and freshman Lucas Watson (93). Just missing state as an individual was Monmouth-Roseville senior Sam Gillen, who missed by one shot, with a 78. Gillen played a steady round most of the day. He had no birdies, but parred 9 of the 18 holes. His only really tough hole was a triple bogey on No. 10 hole. \"It was a solid round,\" Gillen said. \"I just enjoyed being around them (the team) every day, a good group of guys.\" M-R senior Nate Bizarri finished up the day strong with an 84. Bizarri shot a 10 on the No. 3 hole (par 4), but bounced back to eagle No. 18 (par 5). He shot an even-par 36 on the back nine. Titans junior Brayden Reece shot an 84, freshman Nick Corman shot an 86, senior Nathan Corman shot an 88 and sophomore Lane Frieden added a 90. Earning medalist was Springfield's Bailey Gill with a 68.
