The North American Meat Institute argued in a statement that \"cancer is a complex disease not caused by single foods\" and stressed the importance of lifestyle and environmental factors.\nDoctors have warned that a diet loaded with red meat is linked to cancers, including those of the colon and pancreas. The American Cancer Society has long urged people to reduce consumption of red meat and processed meat.\nThe researchers defined processed meat as anything transformed to improve its flavor or preserve it - including salting, curing or smoking.\nThey noted that red meat contains important nutrients but said it was associated with some cancers in several studies. Their report said grilling, pan-frying or other high-temperature methods of cooking red meat produce the highest amounts of chemicals suspected to cause cancer.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
