So half of our games were on primetime national TV every year, and that's when it meant something to be on TV. Hell, these days, everybody's on TV every week.\" \nIn other words, Miami has nothing special it can sell big-time recruits anymore. Let's face it, the two decades of UM dominance were one of the biggest aberrations in college football history. Unlike other great dynasties – Alabama, Nebraska, Notre Dame, USC, etc. -- the 'Canes weren't built on fan support, booster contributions, plush facilities and highly paid coaches. Miami was built on one thing and one thing only: Mike Bianchi reads his hate mail from Ole Miss and Mississippi State fans \nOrlando Sentinel Sports Columnist, Mike Bianchi reads some hate mail in reponse to his saying Ole Miss and Mississippi State should be replaced in the SEC by UCF and USF \nOrlando Sentinel Sports Columnist, Mike Bianchi reads some hate mail in reponse to his saying Ole Miss and Mississippi State should be replaced in the SEC by UCF and USF See more videos \nPLAYERS. \n\"If a player wanted to go to the NFL, he'd come to Miami because we played a great schedule and because we played on television,\" Johnson said. \nThe problem is Miami, since joining the ACC, no longer plays a great schedule and therefore no longer has the market cornered on recruits who want to play on primetime TV. But UM's fans and administration are still living in the 1980s and believe they can become great again by just hiring and firing coaches. \nSadly, it has become all the rage at UM games for delusional fans to spend their money hiring airplanes dragging banners that say \"Fire Al Golden.\" Golden, it seems, is simply the latest coach being victimized by UM's unrealistic fan base. If you want to blame somebody for the dilapidated state of UM's program, blame the administration, former school president Donna Shalala and the Board of Trustees. \nHere's all you need to know: UCF has better facilities than Miami does. The Knights have an on-campus stadium and an indoor practice facility; the Canes have neither. \nIf it rains this week in Tallahassee, Coach Jimbo Fisher will move his Seminoles into a state-of-the-art indoor practice facility to get them ready for the Hurricanes. If it rains this week in Coral Gables, Golden will move his team into the school's indoor volleyball courts and perhaps try to work around the volleyball team's practice schedule. \nUntil Miami realizes it needs to start spending money – and lots of it – to upgrade its football infrastructure, the Canes will continue to wallow in the abyss of insignificance. Memo to Miami: If you want to play big-boy football, stop spending like a small-time program. Do you really think you can compete with the affluent programs that surround you -- Florida State, Florida, Alabama and Georgia – by pinching pennies? Do you really think you can compete in the Daytona 500 by showing up in a 1997 Buick Skylark? \nAlthough ACC Commissioner John Swofford would never admit this publicly, he absolutely has to be second-guessing the league's decision to add Miami 11 years ago. Swofford's grand plan was to put Miami and FSU in separate divisions, play the ACC Championship Game in the State of Florida and have the two powerhouses annually face off in front of sellout crowds and a gigantic national TV audience. \nSince Jimbo took over, FSU has certainly lived up to its end of the bargain, but Miami has now been through three head coaches and still has never even been to an ACC Championship Game. \nAfter visiting J.J. over the summer, I think I finally realize what happened to Miami. \nJohnson, the old UM coach, now lives in the Keys and spends much of his time on his boat in pursuit of dolphin, grouper, sailfish and marlin. \nSadly, it seems, his once-dominant program has also hung a \"Gone Fishin'\" sign on the door to college football relevance. \nmbianchi@tribune.com .
