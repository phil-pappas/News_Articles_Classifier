The town would need three top-tier courses and possibly a disc golf store, he said. \nYankton currently has four courses: Two 18-hole courses (Memorial Park, Gavin’s Point) and two 9-hole courses (Pierson Ranch, Cottonwood). \nThe sport has also proven popular in area towns. There are also two courses in Vermillion, one in Tyndall, one in Pickstown, one in Beresford and one in Wausa, Nebraska. \nBailey said he talked with a national tournament organizer to get a sense for what Yankton would need to host a national tournament, and the response was that if Yankton could host smaller tournaments, word could spread. \n“If we build it, they will come,” Bailey said, smiling, at one point during his presentation. \nThere are a handful of potential locations for courses across the Yankton area, he told the crowd. Such locations include Riverside Park (nine holes), Meridian RV Park (18 holes), Weigand, across the Missouri River (18 holes), as well as Paddlewheel Point and land west of Gavins Point. \nThe size of Yankton could also be a sign that the city could find itself on the national disc golf tour, Bailey said. \nThe National Elite Tour series, for example, has stops this year in Emporia, Kansas (population 25,000), Estacada, Oregon (2,900), Leicester, Massachusetts (11,000) and Fountain Hills, Arizona (23,000). \nAlso at Wednesday’s 1 Million Cups gathering was Todd Larson, the Parks and Recreation Director for the City of Yankton. He informed Bailey that there could be money available through grants for multiple-day tournaments, depending on the time of the year. \nBailey estimated that it would cost $40,000 to build two new 18-hole courses, but possibly $5,000 to upgrade signing and build additional concrete tee pads at the Gavin’s course. \nWhether it is through such a grant, or fundraising, or donations, any money raised could further Bailey’s goal, he said. \n“But I think getting that kind of help will help us in the long run,” Bailey said. “If we get it going now, we could be hosting a national tournament in five years.” \nThere are some parallels to archery that could be made with disc golf, according to Bailey. Yankton was, though, able to land the National Field Archery Association headquarters nearly a decade ago and has annually attracted some of the top tournaments. \n“A lot of people were shocked that we brought in that many people for archery,” he said. “I don’t think we’d get that many countries here, but we’d get that many people, I think.” \nInstead of one big tournament each year, disc golf could potentially hold 10 events, Bailey added. \n“It has the potential to bring in that much money,” he said. \nWhether or not Yankton lands any national tournaments, the sport figures to continue growing, Bailey added. \n“The main thing about it, it’s just fun,” he said. “It’s not all about competition. The more we can spread that, the more I think people will want to join.” \nFollow @jhoeck on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:43:05.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
