Yoder, who became the city’s first full-time PIO in September 2013, told the AJC her last day is Nov. 10.\nYoder, 32, essentially brought Decatur communications into the modern era, making posts on Facebook, Twitter and other social sites de rigueur instead of occasional after thoughts. In her new venture she wants to do the same in helping boost the profiles of small businesses and non-profits.\nYoder grew up in Atlanta, but before coming to Decatur she lived five years in Washington D.C. For two of those she worked for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union when it was pressuring Walmart to improve treatment of employees. She also worked one year for George Washington University’s “Semester in Washington” program.\nCasie Yoder Yoder becomes the city’s third high-profile staffer to leave in recent months. Planning Director Amanda Thompson left in mid August, Senior Engineer John Madajewski left in late August and both jobs remain open, though Angela Threadgill is currently interim planning director.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/19/df/4c/casie-yoder.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:52:44.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
