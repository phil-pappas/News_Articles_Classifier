So … (Thorson) will be fine. He has a lot of work to do, but he'll be fine.\"\nThorson turned the ball over three times (two interceptions and a fumble) in the first half of last Saturday's 24-19 victory over Ball State, but he rebounded in the second half to throw for three touchdowns.\n\"That was a pretty good snapshot of what he's capable of,\" Fitzgerald said.\nThorson knows the defensive intensity will pick up as the Big Ten season unfolds.\n\"In the first half (against Ball State) my attention to detail just wasn't there,\" Thorson said. \"Taking care of the football … that's something we will always stress.\"\nOffensive coordinator Mick McCall says the Gophers (3-1) are going to \"lick their chops\" when they face the first-year quarterback, but \"I think he's up for the challenge.\"\nThorson became the first Northwestern quarterback to throw three or more touchdown passes in a game since Trevor Siemian threw four against Illinois on Nov. 30, 2013. But protecting the ball remains the priority.\n\"Sometimes in the first half he guessed a little bit,\" McCall said. \"I think he would probably tell you that. And sometimes as a young quarterback you get that way. You think you see some things and you say: 'I'm going to take this.' He knows the progression he needs to go through. It's just a learning experience.\"\nfmitchell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kicker34\n Northwestern Wildcats", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560b203e/turbine/ct-northwestern-football-spt-0930-20150929"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:49:22.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
