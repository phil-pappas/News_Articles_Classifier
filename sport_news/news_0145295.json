By SARITA CHOUREY Daufuskie’s 23 inches of rain lifts Beaufort out of drought\nFor those slogging through flooded streets in Bluffton and elsewhere, it may be hard to remember what dry weather was like. But let it be known: Beaufort and Jasper counties are officially no longer suffering from drought.\nBoth counties have graduated from their parched status, with Beaufort’s rainfall boosted substantially by Daufuskie Island. The 8-square-mile island received 23 inches since mid-July, according to the S.C. Department of Natural Resources.\nThe S.C. Drought Response Committee opted to put off upgrading or downgrading the drought status in most counties because of the rainfall to come. On Monday the committee will reevaluate it. However, panel members did downgrade the drought status of the coastal counties of Beaufort, Jasper and Charleston counties, declaring them drought-free. Counties throughout the rest of the state remain in either incipient or moderate status.\nDillon, Marion, Horry, Georgetown, Colleton and Hampton counties were also downgraded — classified from “moderate” drought to the first level of drought, “incipient.”\nFor now, the rest of the state is stuck in “moderate” drought. At its July meeting, the committee declared the entire state to be either “incipient” drought or “moderate” drought status.\nIn the meantime, the S.C, Department of Health and Environmental Control is advising owners and operators of reservoirs to check their dams for problems caused by heavy rainfall from Hurricane Joaquin and to lower the water level in their reservoir, if necessary, to make room for more rain.\nState Climatologist Hope Mizzell The rainfall expected over the next few days has the potential to be the largest and most widespread since June 1.\nThe S.C. Department of Transportation on Thursday issued a warning to drivers to steer clear of flooded areas in coming days as Hurricane Joaquin brings more rain to the state.\nInland flooding, typically linked to tropical storm or hurricane, has historically been the greatest source of fatalities, and caused the most damage to roadway infrastructure, according to the Federal Highway Administration. At least one person has died in the recent day’s flooding in South Carolina.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-01T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:56:02.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
