So you’ll understand if they already cranky Azarenka was crankier still on Tuesday after she had to retire from a match in Wuhan down 4-6, 0-1, then had to answer this question:\nAdChoices\n“Genie Bouchard a couple of months ago said, yes, these experiences are learning experiences, but I’m kind of sick of learning. I’d like to get over it and move on. Can you relate to that a little bit?”\nThough comparing the 21-year-old Bouchard, a one-time Slam finalist who was a top 10 player for all of nine months, to the two-time major champion and former No. 1 Azarenka is a stretch, the essence of the question is fine. For months it’s been “I’m coming back from injury, I’m coming back from injury” from Team Vika. At some point, as the interviewer notes, you have to start winning again, no? Azarenka didn’t appreciate the nuance. Before giving a rote answer about learning her body, this is how Vika started:\nWell, I didn’t lose 11 matches in a row, so it’s a little bit different of a learning experience she has with herself. I’m not in the position to comment on what she’s done.\nD mn. That’s Nike-on-Nike crime! Do you think Azarenka gets a text from a Nike rep after dissing a fellow endorser, gently telling her to never speak ill of others who wear the swoosh? Or is the person who’s tasked with writing said text too afraid that Vika would devil-wears-Prada her right out of a trip to Paris?\nThough the whole thing is my favorite part, my favorite favorite part is Vika saying “I didn’t lose 11 matches in a row” with such conviction that you believe it as a fact. But Bouchard’s longest losing streak was six. She did lose 10 of 11 matches and 13 of 15, but she never came close to an 11-match losing streak.\nBut that’s the thing about talking trash. If it’s good, no one cares (or wants) to fact check.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:37:06.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
