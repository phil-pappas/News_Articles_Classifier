(Photo/Chris Tran/Mill City Sports) \nLOWELL, Mass. — The UMass Lowell River Hawks accomplished a lot on Friday night at the Tsongas Center in front of a crowd of 5,786 screaming fans, but the most important one was defeating the Rensselaer Engineers , 3-0. \nWith the win, UMass Lowell head coach Norm Bazin moves into the 100-win club and improves his overall record with the River Hawks to 100-47-13 over four years, plus one game. He also moves past Bruce Crowder (1991-96, 99-75-19) for sole possession of third place on the UMass Lowell all-time win list. Billy Riley tops the all-time win list with 363 wins (363-270-22). \n“I didn’t realize it until after the game, someone mentioned it before I went into the locker room,” said Bazin. “You don’t pay attention to those types of things when your behind the bench. You try to focus on the next game and it crept up on me. Hopefully I’m around for a couple more.” \nBazin is the fastest coach in UMass Lowell history to hit 100th win mark. His win moves him into the 11th place on the best winning percentage (.666) for Division I hockey coaches list (minimum of 100 wins). He has the best winning percentage of all active head coaches, two spots above University of Michigan head coach Red Berenson (.659). \nA few seniors on the roster have been with Bazin for 76 of his wins and are a big reason he has made it this far. \n“It’s a great achievement,” said senior alternate captain Adam Chapie . “He’s a great coach and we’re happy to get him that 100th win.” \nSenior goaltender Kevin Boyle has only been a part of 21 of Bazin’s wins (47 including his redshirt season), but was a big factor in Bazin’s 100th win. Boyle stopped 27-of-27 shots he faced to pickup his first win and shutout of the 2015-16 season and his fifth shutout of his career. The Massachusetts Minutemen transfer picked up three shutouts in his first active season with the River Hawks. \nEvan Campbell , Michael Louria and Chapie helped on the offensive side of the puck, each picking up goals. Freshman Nick Master had a helper on Chapie’s second period goal to pickup his first career point. \nThe River Hawks are back in action on Friday, October 16 for the first game of a two-game home series against the Colorado College Tigers . Puck drops at 7:15 p.m. eastern on Friday. Mill City Sports' hockey coverage is brought to you by Draft Kings . Play fantasy hockey at DraftKings.com and win cash as soon as the next day!
