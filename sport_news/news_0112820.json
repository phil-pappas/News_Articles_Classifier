He won a Heisman Trophy as a player and coached a Heisman Trophy winner in Danny Wuerffel. \nMaybe it was his confidence as a great coach that made him feel comfortable talking as much trash as he did, because the guy was one of the best ever at it. From zinging his rivals to kicking opposing coaches when they were down, few did it better than Spurrier. He is a legend’s legend. And in honor of him stepping down, we present the best Steve Spurrier quotes all time. \nEnjoy! \nSTEVE SPURRIER BEST QUOTES \n10) On Ron Zook: “He told me I’m a tough act to follow. I told him that’s why he got hired. Some of those coaches that had really great jobs, they didn’t want to touch it.” \n9) When Spurrier was at Duke and beat North Carolina, he and his team took a photo at midfield. Mack Brown, then at UNC, called Spurrier classless for the gesture. \n“Why? I’ve got a better record on that field than he does.” \n8) On why he keeps coaching at his age. \n“Someone said, ‘Why are you still coaching?’ I forgot to get fired, and I’m not going to cheat. That’s about the only way you lose your job. You get fired for losing or you cheat, and they get somebody else.” \n7) On Dabo Swinney saying the two of them are from different planets. \n“Dabo probably thinks there’s [still] nine planets out there.” \n6) To his beloved Danny Wuerffel: @SC_HBC Spurrier to me once after an interception: \"Danny, It's not your fault…It's my fault for putting you in the game.\" Love you Coach! \n— Danny Wuerffel (@DannyWuerffel) October 13, 2015 \n5) On succeeding at age 68 at South Carolina. \n“Back in January, they appointed this guy, and he’s 77 years old, and he’s the leader of a billion people in the world. They call him the pope, and he replaced a guy that was 85 years old. So if he can be the leader of over a billion people worldwide, surely I can get 11 guys on the field.” \n4) On his offensive line in 2006: \n“Well, we can’t trade ‘em. So I guess we have to coach ‘em.” \n3) On speaking out: \n“I’m not one to say ‘no comment’ whether I am right or wrong, but especially if I am right.” \n2) Offense wins games: \n— Edgar Thompson (@osgators) October 13, 2015 \n1) And maybe Spurrier's most famous quip, fired at rival Tennessee: 'You can’t spell Citrus without U-T.” \n— Edgar Thompson (@osgators) October 13, 2015 \nBEST QUOTES ABOUT RIVAL PROGRAMS \nOn Tennessee : And maybe Spurrier's most famous quip, fired at rival Tennessee: 'You can’t spell Citrus without U-T.” \n— Edgar Thompson (@osgators) October 13, 2015 Spurrier: \"Will be the 14th time I've coached in Neyland Stadium. … I've coached there more than some of their head coaches.\" \n— Josh Kendall (@JoshatTheState) October 17, 2013 \n“I know why Peyton came back for his senior year. He wanted to be a three-time star of the Citrus Bowl.” \n“In Knoxville, they’re still doing cartwheels because they went 7-6 and won a bowl game.” \nOn Auburn : Spurrier when a fire at Auburn destroyed 20 books: \"The real tragedy was that 15 hadn't been colored yet.\" \n— Paul Myerberg (@PaulMyerberg) October 13, 2015 \nOn Alabama : \n“In 12 years at Florida, I don’t think we ever signed a kid from the state of Alabama…Of course, we found out later that the scholarships they were giving out at Alabama were worth a whole lot more than ours.” \nOn Arkansas : Spurrier: \"I do feel badly for Arkansas. That’s no fun getting your butt beat at home, homecoming and all that.\" \n— Josh Kendall (@JoshatTheState) October 12, 2013 \nOn Georgia : \n“I don’t know. I sort of always liked playing them the second game because you could always count on them having two or three key players suspended.” \n“Why is it that during recruiting season they sign all the great players, but when it comes time to play the game, we have all the great players? I don’t understand that. What happens to them?” \nAsked if they would beat Georgia: “Is Ray Goff still coaching there?” \nOn Clemson : \n“These two Capital One bowls in a row are pretty nice, but that state championship ain’t bad either!” – Spurrier in 2014 \nOn Florida State :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:34:34.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
