Chief Justice of India HL Dattu said he had spoken to High Court Chief Justice NP Vasanthakumar, who did not anticipate any problem. Parimoksh Seth had filed a petition in Jammu, while another person had approached the high court in Srinagar. Justice Dattu gave this information to Seth, who wanted the hearing to be held in Jammu for security reasons. Two Benches of the high court had passed conflicting orders on the petitions following which the state government had approached the Supreme Court and got an order for hearing of both the petitions by a three-member Bench in Srinagar. But Seth said the situation was not conducive in Srinagar and sought the hearing to be held in Jammu or outside the state. He cited a beef party hosted by an MLA and the statements of some senior ministers. He, however, withdrew his petition following the CJI's remarks, with the liberty to approach the SC again in case of any problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:00:07.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
