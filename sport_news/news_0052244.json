He used his head again to score 13 minutes later for a 2-0 lead. \nBoth, however, were violent goals for the freshman. He emerged from the celebration cupping his left ear on the first goal, and his momentum carried him into the goal post on the second. \n“The first one, I couldn't hear for a little bit – it was burning like crazy,” Rubi said. “The second one, I just went for it. I didn't know the post was there, and I ran right into it. That hurt.” \nBut Rubi's a tough kid, one of the team's leading scorers from a talented freshmen class that includes Christian Herrera, who scored the third goal, Luichi Caceres, who had chances, and Giovanni Fuentes. \n“He's a freshman that's built like a 30-year old, and he is a bruiser,” Cantwell said. “He's very, very good on the ball, and he knows his position. I tell him, 'Alex, this is what you need to do,' and he just keeps that in mind and that's what he does.” \nMonticello had its chances – none better than what was queued up in the first half for Hunter Scheuerman, who booted a shot over the goal post despite being left alone inside the 18-yard box. \nHerrera drove a header into the net with 18:11 left in the game for St. Teresa. \nThe Bulldogs, who needed penalty kicks to escape an upset bid by Decatur Christian/LSA in Wednesday's regional semifinal, looked more like the squad they were all season. Saturday's win matched a 3-0 victory against the Sages on Oct. 5. \n“We took it easy against Decatur Christian,” Rubi said. “Couldn't do this against Monticello because Monticello was way better.” \nBefore winning a regional championship in 2013, St. Teresa hadn't held the trophy since 1992. Now this season, the Bulldogs captured the city title, the St. Teresa Invitational title and the regional. \n“We set out three goals early on in the year … and we did all three,” Cantwell said. \nNext, the Bulldogs play Champaign St. Thomas More in the Urbana Sectional at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday at the University of Illinois' turf fields. \nThe Sabers beat Fisher and Champaign Judah Christian by a combined score of 10-0 in their regional. \n“We just have to go out and win the next game and the next game... and the next game, so we can make it to state,” Rubi said. \namcnamee@herald-review.com|(217) 421-6970", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:37:36.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
