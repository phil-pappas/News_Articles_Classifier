More noteworthy and of concern to the rest of the Mid-American Conference was the Falcons' best game of the season on defense and special teams.\n\"It's a very volatile combination when all three things are clicking like that,'' BG coach Dino Babers said.\nHolding Akron to 10 points is a much different story than beating hapless UMass last week, 62-38.\n\"We got whipped today,'' Akron coach Terry Bowden said. \"They beat us on special teams. They beat us on offense. They beat us on defense.''\nThat complete package thrust BG (5-2, 3-0) into sole possession of first place in the MAC East, ahead of Ohio University (5-2, 2-1). OU lost to Western Michigan, 49-14.\nJohnson finished with 357 yards passing on 25 of 30 passing and did not throw an interception. Even though it was his second-fewest passing yards this season, Johnson's single-game QB rating was a stunning 238.3. The senior from Harrisburg, Pa., entered the game with 2,534 yards passing.\nHe even had a 16-yard reception on a fourth-down double-pass that set up running back Fred Coppet's six-yard stroll across the goal line for a 42-10 lead in the third quarter.\n\"The big thing was we got the tempo going,'' Johnson said. \"We were able to get more plays off faster, and that puts a lot of stress on the defense.''\nLewis, a sophomore from Pickerington, caught six passes for 118 yards, 32 yards under his per-game average. His 902 yards receiving led the Football Bowl Subdivision.\nDonovan Wilson scored two rushing touchdowns.\nBG amassed 532 yards offense -- its lowest total this season -- and still averaged 7.1 yards per play against an Akron defense that had been ranked second in the MAC.\n\"Everybody was terrible,'' Akron nose tackle Cody Grice said. \"We played terrible; the coaches coached terrible. It was just a bad effort as a whole.\"\nLINK: MAC standings BG is at Kent State next week, followed by a key stretch against visiting Ohio, at Western Michigan, and home against No. 22 Toledo in what is shaping up to be the MAC game of the year.\nDoor still open: Akron (3-4, 1-2) still has a path to the top of the MAC East. While BG has a difficult road ahead, Akron's appears easier. After a bye next week, it hosts Central Michigan followed by road games against UMass and Miami, before closing at home against Buffalo and Kent State.\n\"Nothing is less important in life than the score at halftime and that's about where we are in our schedule,'' Bowden said. \"I do think Bowling Green is about the best team we play.''\nOpportunities lost: The Zips had opportunities, despite the final margin. Special teams blunders and ill-timed penalties on defense didn't do the them any favors.\nAnd 10 points is not going to beat BG on any given Saturday.\nAkron's afternoon could be summed up on an early second-half play. Its interception and long return on defense were negated by two personal fouls and an offside penalty, while BG had one personal foul on the same, bizarre play. The net result: a Bowling Green first down the Akron 48.\nBG's Ryan Burbrink soon followed with an over-the-shoulder catch of a perfect Johnson spiral in the end zone for a 34-yard TD on fourth down. BG led, 35-10.\nAkron sophomore QB Thomas Woodson completed 18 of 28 passes for 91 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions. He ran 13 times for 63 yards. Conor Hundley rushed for 69 yards.\nThe 59 points was the most allowed by Akron since 2011.\nA blocked punt at midfield set up BG's first scoring drive, but Akron recovered with a hold on defense and an efficient scoring drive, keyed by Woodson's naked bootleg to convert a fourth down at the BG 29. Woodson's 14-yard TD pass to Tyrell Goodman tied it, 7-7.\nLewis and Teo Redding burned Akron DB Larry Hope on pair of long catches to advance a 95-yard scoring drive that put BG ahead for good, 14-7.\n\"Our team is built on the defense being the dominant factor in the game so our offense can do our thing,'' Bowden said. \"Their offense took over the game, so we couldn't do that.''\nAkron fumbled the ensuing kickoff at the 12, and Johnson threw to Lewis for a TD on the next play.\nAfter a 46-yard field goal into a tough wind by Akron's Robert Stein, the Zips surrendered a 77-yard kickoff return (Stein prevented the TD) to the 23. BG missed a 32-yard field goal after a delay of game penalty.\nTwo Akron penalties contributed to an 89-yard TD drive late in the first half that Johnson finished with a 13-yard pass to Gehrig Dieter for a 28-10 halftime lead.\nNotes: Akron starting left tackle Isaiah Williams missed his second straight game with injury, and injured fullback Newman Williams did not make the trip. Right tackle Quaison Osborne left the game early and did not return. . . BG has won 16 consecutive division games . . . Akron has lost seven straight to BG.", "external_links": ["http://www.mac-sports.com/standings.aspx?path=football&standings=75", "http://www.bgsufalcons.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=5430"], "published": "2015-10-18T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:28:43.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
