He had first-half scoring bursts of 60 and 35 yards in last Friday's 55-20 romp over conference rival Bensalem. \nOstopowicz said the squad's offensive line has \"come a long way since the beginning of the season. Those guys are really starting to mesh.\" \nCenter Mike Gallagher, guards Dan Lare and Dan Liberio, tackles Tobias McCullough and Mark Shadle, and ends Keith Earle, Nick Vasger, and Owen Thomas lead the charge up front. \nJunior quarterback Reece Udinski has shined by completing 78 of 186 passes for 1,213 yards and 12 TDs. He connected on 18 of 24 throws for 254 yards and three scores in a Week 2 win over West Catholic. \nUdinski's primary targets are Ostopowicz, Earle, wideout Ricky Johns, and slotbacks Justis Henley and Jake Hubler. \nAgainst Bensalem, the Knights' defense featured linemen Liberio, Earle, Vasger and Korey Thompson, linebackers Johns and Dontae Stewart, and backs Ostopowicz and Henley. Johns returned a fumble for a 51-yard TD. \nNorth Penn visits National Conference co-leader Pennsbury (6-1, 4-0) at 7 p.m. Friday in Fairless Hills. Beck said West, a Delaware State recruit who doubles as a defensive back, will be a game-time decision. \n\"Physicality is going to be a big part of this game,\" said Ostopowicz, who is considering Kutztown and Shippensburg for college. \"We're going to have to be ready to face a very good offensive backfield.\" \nNotes. Edison, of the Public League, has canceled the rest of its season due to a rash of injuries and academic issues. The Owls (2-5) will forfeit their games vs. Class AAAA Independence League rivals Northeast and Ben Franklin. . . . Tyliek Raynor, a running back and Arizona recruit, is expected to return to Imhotep Charter's lineup Saturday vs. School of the Future. He missed the last five games with a shoulder injury. . . .
