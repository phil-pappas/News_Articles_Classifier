An administrative committee of lawmakers led by Kotek and Senate President Peter Courtney , D-Salem, could vote to remove the flag at any time.\nThe flag's \"symbol of racist intolerance\" is in \"direct conflict with Oregon values of fairness and equality,\" Kotek, D-Portland, said in a statement. She wants the flagpole left empty until Mississippi adopts a new flag that \"honors the dignity of all people.\"\nBut Courtney, out of deference to Mississippi's lawmakers, wants to give officials there a chance to change their flag first. That could leave the issue unresolved for several more months.\nMississippi's Legislature is set to meet from Jan. 5 to May 8. If lawmakers don't change the flag in that span, Courtney said, officials in Salem should act.\n\"The flag has to come down, one way or the other,\" Courtney said in an interview. \"But it's important to try to help another state deal with the issue in a constructive way.\"\nOregon lawmakers began calling to remove the flag after The Oregonian/OregonLive called attention to it in the wake of a racially motivated church shooting that killed nine in South Carolina. Before that, the flag had flown as part of a decade-old Walk of Flags on the west side of the Oregon Capitol without complaint.\nFormer state Sen. Margaret Carter, D-Portland is advising Courtney and has been in contact with current and former members of the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus.\nVestiges of the Confederacy Five states have Confederate imagery on their official flags: Mississippi: The only state that still incorporates the Confederate battle flag, a star-studded red St. Andrews cross (or \"X\") on a blue field. Alabama: A red St. Andrews cross on a white field, representing a feature of the Confederate battle flag. Florida: A red St. Andrews cross on a white field behind the state seal. Arkansas: Three of four stars surrounding \"Arkansas\" represent nations the area belonged to before statehood (Spain, France, U.S.); the fourth represents the Confederacy. Georgia: Identical to the official Confederate flag, a circle of stars on a blue field with one white and two red stripes, but with the state coat of arms. \"They would like to get a chance for Mississippians to take the flag down first, through legislation,\" Carter said. Courtney said Mississippi legislative leaders told him the same thing when he called over the summer.\nMississippi Sen. Willie Simmons, a member of the caucus, confirmed plans to try to change the flag. \"We're doing everything we possibly can to get that legislation passed,\" he said. \"I'm supportive of it coming down anywhere in the country because of what it does in dividing the citizens.\"\nRep. Lew Frederick , when contacted by the Oregonian/OregonLive last June, was the first lawmaker to demand that the Mississippi flag come down from the Oregon Capitol.\n\"I can agree that it symbolizes Southern history, but the Southern history it symbolizes is a history of racism, of dehumanizing oppression,\" Frederick, D-Portland, said in a statement at the time. He compared the emblem to a Nazi swastika. \"That flag never meant anything else.\"\nHe didn't respond to a request for comment for this story, but his office confirmed last month that legislative leaders were still working through questions about timing.\nCarter said she had a \"great conversation\" with Kotek, Frederick and Sen. Jackie Winters , R-Salem, over the summer but that Kotek and Frederick were less interested in deferring to another state.\n\"They are more concerned about the people of Oregon,\" she said. \"And so it was very clear they want to respect the constituents of our state who say it's time [for the flag] to come down.\"\nBut as long as Courtney is a co-chair of the Legislature's administrative committee, the flag won't go without his assent. He did say he's prepared to act sooner if Mississippi lawmakers' plans falter before the end of their session.\n\"I have struggled over the last few weeks and months to find a way to help Mississippi,\" he said. \"It's a very difficult issue.\"\n— Denis C.
