Will Melbourne and Perth remain undefeated? Will the Kings bounce back after a tough round two?\nHere are five burning questions heading into round 3 of NBL action.\nCorey Webster is expected to make his return to the New Zealand Breakers this week. Source: News Corp Australia\nCan Corey Webster’s return revamp the Breakers?\nThe New Zealand Breakers have had their struggles so far this season, losing both of their round two match-ups to see the reigning champions fall to last place on the NBL ladder.\nOn the bright side, hometown guard Corey Webster has returned to the club after an unsuccessful NBA trial, and is expected to give the team a massive lift. Webster will rejoin star import Cedric Jackson as one of the most dynamic back-court duos in the league, with the hopes of successfully defending their championship.\nNBL WRAP: ROUND 2\nBULLETS SECURE BOOMERS COACH FOR NBL RETURN\nCan the Kings bounce back?\nAfter an impressive season debut, the Kings seem to have fallen flat, losing their last two games as they search desperately for another victory.\nJosh Childress’s injury has kept him sidelines for longed than expected and it’s still not known whether he’ll suit up for Sydney’s matchup against New Zealand on Wednesday night, but one thing is for sure, they’ll need him back soon if they’re to compete for a top-4 spot this season.\nSydney Kings import Marcus Thornton is beginning to get into rhythm heading into round three.

Source: News Corp Australia\nCan Illawarra give Perth their first loss?\nApart from Melbourne, Illawarra is arguably the hottest team in the league right now, dominating on both ends of the floor during both of their impressive round two wins.\nPerth aren’t a particularly flashy team, but they’re yet to lose a game so far this season, with Illawarra their biggest threat entering round three.
