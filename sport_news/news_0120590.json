Elaine Thompson AP i SEATTLE \nThey still couldn’t finish. So now, are the Seahawks finished? \nAfter a week spent preaching and coaching and pleading and repeating coach Pete Carroll’s mantra-gone-bad, the Seahawks had a 23-14 lead in the fourth quarter. \nThen that defense allowed Carolina’s third and fourth 80-yard touchdown drive Sunday. The killer scene: Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman, Seattle’s two All-Pro cover men, angrily pointing and gesturing to each other while tight end Greg Olsen caught the 26-yard touchdown pass with 32 seconds left. \nThat sent the undefeated Panthers a stunning, 27-23 victory – and the Seahawks to another, perhaps season-altering defeat in the final minutes and seconds. \nSeattle (2-4) has been outscored 48-9 in the fourth quarters of its last five games.

Marshawn Lynch returned from missing two games with a strained hamstring to run for his first touchdown since February’s Super Bowl. Seattle got two more interceptions, by Thomas and Kam Chancellor after their bad game at Cincinnati. \nYet the two-time defending NFC champions blew a lead in the fourth quarter for the sixth time in eight games dating to January’s NFC championship. \nWhen it ended, with Doug Baldwin hopelessly pitching back a lateral trying to move the ball out of his own end as time expired, many in the record crowd of 69,020 at CenturyLink Field booed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:39:07.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
