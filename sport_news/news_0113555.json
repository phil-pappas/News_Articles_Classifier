Comment Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 12:30 AM By Mike MendezSports Editor Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 12:30 AM It is hard to imagine a McPherson College Hall of Fame without former basketball coach, and father of Dogball, Roger Trimmell, and former player Jonathan Coachman. And after last Saturday, Bulldog fans won’t have to, with Trimmell and Coachman going in together in front of a packed Mingenback Theatre. Trimmell played for the McPherson College basketball team, and graduated in 1973, and still holds the school record with 16 assists in one game. He returned to the school as the head basketball coach in 1982, and had a long, successful career that went to 2008. In his time as the head coach at McPherson College, Trimmell became the winningest coach in Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) history with a conference record of 221-211. He was named KCAC coach of the year twice, once in his second season with the Bulldogs, and another in the 1995-96 season. Trimmell coached 61 all-conference athletes, and coached three KCAC Players of the year, including Coachman. “It is very rewarding to be a part of the Hall of Fame, and to have all these people come back,” Trimmell said. “And the wins, they are nice. But really it’s the relationships that you build and make. And seeing, in this case your student athletes, go on to successful careers, that’s very rewarding. I knew I wanted to coach, but I really didn’t imagine this. Of course we got here, and this is my alma mater, so it meant something special to me, and a great town to raise a family, so the years just roll by then.” Coachman was a 1995 graduate of McPherson College, and left a big mark on Bulldog basketball. When he left, he was the school record holder for career points, assists, and rebounds. In his career, Coachman was named first-team all-conference in three of his four seasons with the Bulldogs, and was named KCAC Player of the Year twice, following his junior and senior seasons. Following McPherson College, Coachman got into sports broadcasting, as an anchor at KAKE TV in Wichita. He went on to get a job as an announcer for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Coachman was in pro wrestling for nine years before getting a job as an anchor for SportsCenter on ESPN. “I came in not really expecting anything, and just kind of adjusted things as we went,” Coachman said. “And I think that is what I had to do in my career. I wasn’t planning on doing 10 years of pro wrestling, but that’s what we did. Whatever road you go down, you can make it your own road. And that is one thing that Coach Trimmell taught us, and I still use that today, is, if I can make it to ESPN after 10 years of pro wrestling, anybody can do anything.” Page 2 of 2 - Contact Mike Mendez at mmendez@mcphersonsentinel.com and follow him on Twitter @MendezSentinel.
