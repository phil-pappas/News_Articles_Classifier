He said the postponement gave the Kings extra days to become familiar with the ‘triangle offense’ before they play their first game in the Philippine Cup.\nGinebra’s first game is against a team Cone is very familiar with — the Star Hotshots, which he coached before San Miguel Corporation (SMC) management plucked him out of that job to handle the underachieving Kings.\nGinebra was supposed to start its All-Filipino bid against Meralco tomorrow at the Mall of Asia (MOA) Arena in Pasay City, but the game has been set to a later date.\nIn its place will be the PBA opening ceremony which will be three days late after Typhoon “Lando” cancelled all sports activities in Metro Manila last Sunday.\nInstead, the Kings will open against the Hotshots on Sunday at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n“We have a lot more preparation time here. And you know… the team is built differently because we have two big, super talented players to build our team around,” said Cone yesterday.\nAfter the opening ceremony, the first game of the season will pit the Star Hotshots against Rain or Shine who will play minus its star, Paul Lee, sidelined for two months because of injury.\nPrior to his transfer, Cone led the Hotshots to five PBA championships, including a Grand Slam title in 2014.\nConvinced of his golden touch, SMC feels Cone can turn Ginebra’s fortunes around, the way he did for the Hotshots.\nGinebra last won a championship in the 2008 Fiesta Cup. Since then, the closest the team got to a title was when it lost to Alaska in the finals of the 2013 Commissioner’s Cup.\nCone appears to be excited with his new task, knowing that Ginebra has enough talent to become a champion team again.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:30:25.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
