We created a lot of passing situations, which lets us play the kind of defense that lets players pin their ears back a little bit and us to make calls that enhance pressure. We're fortunate to have some pretty good guys who can execute it and do a good job in that regard.\" \nAffected by the pressure, Allen finished 20 of 40 with one touchdown and three interceptions. \nHe also fumbled once on a hard sack from Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen, who threw a Texas A&M guard out of the way to free himself for a clear run at Allen. \nAllen was sacked five times. \nFreshman quarterback Kyler Murray — who also saw time — was sacked once as well. \nMurray was 2 of 4 with no touchdowns and an interception. \nTra Carson — the Aggies' 6-foot, 235-pound running back — ran for 110 yards in Texas A&M's previous game, a win over Mississippi State. \nThe Tide held Carson to 46 yards on 13 carries, an average of 3.5 yards per attempt. \nIncluding sacks, the Aggies finished with 32 yards on 25 carries. \nAllen was one of the primary catalysts for Alabama's defense. He had five tackles, four stops for a loss, two sacks and the forced fumble. \nNine different Tide players had at least a shared tackle for a loss. \nAllen, Ragland, safety Ronnie Harrison and outside linebackers Ryan Anderson and Tim Williams all had at least one sack. \nTo put the numbers into perspective, Arizona State ranks first nationally in tackles for a loss per game with 9.86. \nUtah is first in sacks with 4.23 per game. \n\"When it's second-and-5, it's hard to rush the passer,\" Saban said. \"When it's second-and-10, it's a lot easier. When it's third-and-8, it's a lot easier. We created a lot of those situations in the game, and I think we were able to affect the quarterback because of it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:24:05.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
