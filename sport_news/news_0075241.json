Acosta, a senior wide receiver, had a kickoff return for a touchdown and scored another touchdown on a screen pass in a 65-7 victory.\n“Last week was very hard for the kids,” Chaparral coach Paul Nihipali said. “They thought they were being punished for doing nothing wrong. We had to be creative to make it exciting for them in practice, but they felt one week was taken from them.”\nBoulder City led 7-0 but Chaparral scored 65 unanswered points to close the game. Andrew Solis had five touchdown passes for Chaparral, finding Kentrell Petite twice. Richard Nelson had three total scores.\nChaparral improves to 5-2 overall and 3-1 in the Sunrise League. Boulder City is winless in the Sunrise.\nRay Brewer can be reached at 702-990-2662 or ray.brewer@lasvegassun.com .
