(lehighvalleylive.com file photo) By Greg Joyce | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 07, 2015 5:51 PM View/Post Comments \nThere will be four state champions in high school football for a final time this December in Pennsylvania. \nBeginning in the 2016-17 season, the state will move from four to six classifications after the PIAA Board of Directors voted 26-4 Wednesday in favor of expansion, District 11 chairman and Whitehall AD Bob Hartman confirmed. \nThe board also voted 23-7 in favor of expanding boys and girls basketball, baseball and softball to six classes. Soccer and volleyball will move to four classes, field hockey to three classes and lacrosse to two classes. \n\"I think it was inevitable,\" Easton football coach Steve Shiffert said shortly after the decision. \"The powers that be wanted Pennsylvania to be on par with other states with our number of high schools. It's going to give a lot more kids opportunities to play in state playoffs.\" \nThe six-class system will shorten the overall season by one week, from 16 to 15. How schools adjust to that will be determined on a league-by-league basis. District 11 will only determine when the playoffs will start, Hartman said previously . \nEarly indications suggest the EPC and Colonial League would be in favor of cancelling one scrimmage to maintain a 10-game regular season schedule. \n\"I think it's going to benefit our conference, to be honest with you,\" Shiffert said. \"We'll be stretched out from possibly 3A to 6A. We may have representation in four different divisions.\" \nHOW IT AFFECTS DISTRICT 11 \nA 230-plus page document presented to the PIAA board by the Strategic Planning and Football Steering Committees, obtained by lehighvalleylive.com in June , broke down how the schools would fit into six classes based on current enrollment numbers. As is the case now, schools would have the option to move up a class. These could change based on the new enrollment numbers that will be collected Nov. 1. \nSIX CLASSES (10 PERCENT) \n6A (12) : Parkland, Liberty, Allen, Easton, Emmaus, Dieruff, Pocono Mountain West, Freedom, Pleasant Valley, Stroudsburg, Northampton, Pocono Mountain East. \n5A (6) : Nazareth, East Stroudsburg South, Whitehall, East Stroudsburg North, Bangor, Southern Lehigh. \n4A (5) : Pottsville, Blue Mountain, Central Catholic, Saucon Valley, Notre Dame. \n3A (12) : Northwestern Lehigh, Bethlehem Catholic, Lehighton, Tamaqua, Wilson, Jim Thorpe, Palisades, Salisbury, North Schuylkill, Pen Argyl, Palmerton, Northern Lehigh. \n2A (5) : Pine Grove, Catasauqua, Panther Valley, Minersville, Marian Catholic. \n1A (6) : Mahanoy Area, Schuylkill Haven, Shenandoah Valley, Williams Valley, Tri-Valley, Nativity BVM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:07:00.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
