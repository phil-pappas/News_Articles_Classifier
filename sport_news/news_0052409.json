Eventually, it could be heard by the Supreme Court.\nWhile Scott is against paying athletes, he was proud to tout several new developments such as full cost of attendance stipends and improved health care coverage. The Pac-12 is also pushing autonomy proposals for athletes to have the rights for commercial opportunities (entirely outside of athletics) and dedicate fewer hours to sports.\n\"Our student-athletes are getting more support financially, academically, medically, nutritionally than they've ever received before,\" Scott said. \"And I'm proud to say that the Pac-12 is providing tremendous leadership in this area.\"\n\nCal's recruiting could reap more victories\nAfter Cuonzo Martin brought in two of the top-10 prospects in the country in one class, a lot of people would love to know his secret.\nThe second-year Cal coach says his secret isn't very secret at all: It's his school's reputation as the No. 1 public university in the world and the No. 3 global university.\n\"Those are the stats that as a father that I'm consumed with,\" he said. \"The wins will come and go, but when you get those types of numbers, you want to be here. And that's how I sell my program.\"\nThat may be the case, but newcomers Ivan Rabb and Jaylen Brown may not hang around long enough to earn degrees. Both were consensus five-star prospects in the 2015 class, and both are candidates to be one-and-done players.\nIn the meantime, they dramatically boost Cal's chances of competing for a conference title. Brown is a 6-foot-7 small forward in the mold of former Arizona standout Stanley Johnson who can drive and score with power. Rabb is a physical forward who gives Cal automatic credibility in the post.\nEven current players tend to pump their fists when landing recruits of that caliber, Tyrone Wallace said.\n\"Yeah, we celebrate,\" said Wallace, who himself is a returning all-conference player. \"I think the players do play a large role in getting those players to come, because we're going to be the people that they're going to play with at the end of the day. So I think if we can get a good feel for each other and get along well, it all works in the end.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:25:59.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
