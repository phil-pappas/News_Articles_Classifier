Mac-Hi battled to avoid the shutout, and came through in the fourth quarter. Danny Flores split the uprights with a 39-yard field goal to get the Pioneers on the board. “When I was hired, there were some excitement about changing the football program into a winner,” South said. “It has been a tough year with injuries and playing The Dalles and Crook County with an inexperienced team in the preseason. I share the disappointment of our community. “I am hoping that next year, when we are looking at our preseason schedule, we can make some changes,” South continued. “It may take some help at the state level, but it is important for the safety of our kids. It is a difficult conversation that needs to be had.” The Pioneers host winless Ontario on Friday in a GOL battle. “I am not alright with losing,” Short said. “As a team, we are doing everything we can to be successful.” La Grande 56, McLoughlin 3 Mac-Hi 0 0 0 3 — 3 La Grande 32 6 6 12 — 56 No further statistics were available.
