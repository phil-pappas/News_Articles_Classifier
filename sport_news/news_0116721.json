Obviously, they’re such a skilled team. Top guys in the NHL and I thought we outworked them for the most part.’’\nThe trickle-down effect of Barkov’s injury caused Panthers coach Gerard Gallant to shuffle all four lines at one point and each trio scored at least one goal. He also opted to give backup goalie Al Montoya his second start of the season to give Roberto Luongo a breather.\nAnd Montoya was magnificent, stopping several point-blank shots by the league’s fourth-ranked offense as he recorded 33 saves.\n“It wasn’t the wait around see what happens game like we’ve been playing the last few,’’ Montoya said. “It was really encouraging to see. Even though we go down early 1-0, guys battled, starting with Jagr, who’s been phenomenal from the start. All the way through to the fourth line.\n“On a couple of scoring chances I felt I made the first save and they whacked it out of there. Our defensemen were great. Our forwards were coming back to the middle really helping me, making it easy.\n“I felt like a kid like I used to, just skating everywhere, getting in front of that puck, doing whatever it takes to stop the puck, having fun, that’s when I’m at my best.’’\nIn Montoya’s earlier start on Oct. 13, the Panthers downed the Hurricanes 4-1.\n“Al was excellent. The first one got by him off a deflection in front but after that he was pretty solid, shut the door and made seven or eight huge saves for us,’’ Gallant said. “Luongo has played great … but we don’t want to wear a guy down.’’\nThe Panthers revamped top line of Jonathan Huberdeau, Bjugstad and Jagr didn’t skip a beat without arguably the team’s best two-way player this season as they were on the ice for the first three goals. Barkov, who was sporting an ace bandage-like cast while stretching off ice with teammates before morning skate, will be further evaluated by team doctors on Monday to assess the gravity of the injury.\n“It sucks for sure,’’ Huberdeau said of Barkov’s injury before morning skate. “It’s part of hockey. He blocked a shot; he paid the price for the team and it happens that [he] broke something.\n“Everybody has to step up. Bjugstad is going to be on our line so it’s going to be huge to still have possession of the puck and control the puck in our zone.’’\nThat they did.\nIn a team meeting Panthers captain Willie Mitchell urged his teammates to work harder than they had been and, “stay out of the penalty box.’’ One out of two isn’t bad, as just 1:51 after the opening faceoff defenseman Alexander Petrovic was called for a delay of game. It took Jamie Benn, last year’s leading scorer, just eight seconds to deflect in Tyler Seguin’s blast.\nThe Panthers gave up two power-play goals in each of their last two one-goal losses in Chicago and Pittsburgh, and have allowed seven over their last five games.\nAt 11:03, Huberdeau’s slick neutral zone pass sprung Jagr, who held the puck before lifting it over Stars prone defenseman Alex Goligoski as well as goalie Kari Lehtonen for his team-leading sixth goal (career No. 728 th ).\nThen 2:15 later, Huberdeau, who had two assists, set up Bjugstad in the high slot for a rising wrister, his third goal, and a 2-1 lead after one. The two played together on the top line last season until Jagr joined the team in late February.\nIt took just 1:22 of the second period for defenseman Aaron Ekblad to pot his first goal since April 15 and the first goal by a Panthers defenseman this season. Jagr centered it to Bjugstad, who dropped it for Ekblad. The reigning Calder Trophy recipient drilled it home for a 3-1 cushion and ended Lehtonen’s night. He was yanked for Antti Niemi after giving up three goals on 11 shots.\n“He’s a sharpshooter. When he gets the shot more than likely it’s going in,’’ Bjugstad said of Ekblad. “I think they’ll start pouring in for him now. He was yelling for it. He wanted that puck so I gave it up.’’\nNiemi didn’t fare much better, as at 14:59, Dave Bolland batted in Dmitry Kulikov’s flip-shot from the blue line for his first goal of the season and a 4-1 lead after two. Benn added his NHL-leading eight goal at 4:01 of the third, and fourth against the Panthers in a week.\n“The key was playing our game and getting pucks behind their defensemen,’’ Gallant said. “They were coming off a long [4-0] road trip and we wanted to put pressure on their defense and we caused some turnovers.’’\nBut Reilly Smith took advantage of Dallas’ 20 th turnvoer and answered just 1:31 later to preserve Florida’s three-goal cushion. Vincent Trocheck, moved from third line right wing to second-line center, set up his new linemate, Quinton Howden, who went from the fourth line to the second, and he capped off the rout with a greasy goal in front with 3:05 left.\nIt was Jagr who started the comeback and who led the team with five shots to go with a goal and an assist for his 10 th point in eight games.\n“We haven’t played very well since the Buffalo game and even the Buffalo game I had a bad feeling,’’ Jagr said of 3-2 win over the Sabres on Oct. 15 before losing the next three. “We didn’t have puck possession much. Today it looked like first time in awhile we make plays. They’re a pretty skilled team so we took advantage of them.\n“I really like to play with Barkov, everybody knows that. Injury happens. It’s pretty good to know I can play with Bjugstad. It’s not easy to play with me, trust me. He’s a big guy, he can skate. He makes a lot of good plays.’’\nHuberdeau still hasn’t scored his first goal but he was the ultimate playmaker Saturday.\n“[Huberdeau] played good today,’’ Jagr s aid. “He was working hard. It’s going to happen, don’t worry about it.’’\nNot to be overlooked, Panthers defensemen Erik Gudbranson and Willie Mitchell were a team-best plus-3, and Gudbranson sparked the team by dominating a second-period fight with Dallas toughie Antoine Roussel.\n“I thought they initiated it,’’ Gallant said. “Guddy did a good job, it was a good scrap.’’\nFinnish friends\nThe Panthers took care of the Stars' 1 and 1a goalie tandem of Niemi, 32, and Lehtonen, 31, Finnish countrymen of Panthers forward Jussi Jokinen , who notched two assists.\n“Both are about my age,’’ said Jokinen, 32. “Lehtonen was the second overall pick [in 2002]. He’s really talented and I played on junior national teams with him. Niemi’s a late-bloomer who in last four to five y years has played great. There are so many good goalies from my country. It’s cool. I got to find a way to beat them for sure.’’\n Ice Hockey Florida Panthers Jaromir Jagr Dallas Stars Jonathan Huberdeau Al Montoya Roberto Luongo", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c3f29/turbine/sfl-photos-panthers-at-stars-20151024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c428b/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-stars-1025-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-25T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:15:52.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
