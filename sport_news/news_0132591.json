Today will see two sessions with first being four Foursomes and second being four Fourballs and Sunday will feature 12 singles. Currently US, who were 4-1 after first day, lead Internationals 4 &frac12; - 5 &frac12;. Meanwhile in the draw made for today morning’s Foursomes, Anirban Lahiri of India will once again sit and hopefully make a return for the afternoon Foursomes. Also sitting out today morning will be Thongchai Jaidee, who won his first point with Charl Schwartzel in Fourballs.\nThat win by Bae and Danny Lee, came soon after South Africans, Branden Grace and Louis Oosthuizen, delivered a knock-out punch to the much-touted Jordan Spieth — Dustin Johnson pairing 4 and 3 in the shortest match of the day.\nIt was a result that had Spieth fuming and saying, \"That was one of the worst rounds of golf I’ve felt over the ball in a long time.\" He added, \"You know, that was Merry Christmas to them (Internationals).\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:45:50.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
