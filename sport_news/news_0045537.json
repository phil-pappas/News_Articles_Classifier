Related Stories Investigator: Nurse Brown misled during internal affairs probe of Mathew Ajibade death Related Links The full story: Mathew Ajibade case timeline By Jan Skutch Former deputy Maxine Evans testified on Tuesday she was truthful during her interviews with investigators in the wake of Mathew Ajibade’s death at the Chatham County jail event if her responses were not always consistent.\n“I may have made some misstatements,” Evans testified about her recollection of how many times deputies looking in on Ajibade as he sat in a restraining chair. “I was truthful as to how I remembered it.”\nShe said her testimony to the Chatham County grand jury in June was from her memory, adding she was as truthful as she could be.\n“Were you reckless that night?” defense attorney Bobby Phillips asked.\n“No, Sir, I was not,” Evans replied.\n“Did you cause his death?”\n“No, Sir, I didn’t.”\nEvans also told jurors that Ajibade’s death “bothered me for a long time and I still think about it.”\nEvans, 56, is charged with involuntary manslaughter by failing to monitor Ajibade while he was in restraints. Two co-defendants, former deputy Jason Kenny and licensed practical nurse Gregory Brown also are on trial in the case.\nOn Monday, Chatham County Superior Court Judge James F. Bass Jr. granted a directed verdict of acquittal for Brown, a 45-year-old Corizon contract nurse at the jail, on the involuntary manslaughter charge after granting defense attorney Tom Withers argument that prosecutors had failed to prove a standard of care necessary to send the case to a jurors’ hearing of evidence.\nBrown, who had worked for Corizon at the jail for two weeks, remains in the case on charges of public records fraud and making a false statement to investigators.\nBass rejected a motion for directed verdict on the manslaughter county for former deputy Jason Kenny, 31.\nAll three defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nTrial resumes today with additional defense testimony expected. Closing arguments should begin today also.\nEvans’ election to take the witness stand opened her to cross examination by Assistant District Attorney Matt Breedon who questioned Evans about her seven statements to Georgia Bureau of Investigation agents, sheriff’s internal affairs investigators and the grand jury in the case.\nProsecutors contend Ajibade was left in the restraining chair in a holding cell at 11:47 p.m. on Jan. 1, then ignored between 12:09 a.m. on Jan. 2 and 1:38 a.m. when Evans found him unresponsive.\nBreedon repeatedly challenged Evans about seven statements and the five checks listed on a restraint chair log Evans generated.\n“I generated the log prematurely because I knew one had to be done,” Evans testified.\n“Which one of these seven different statements is true?” Breedon asked.\n“He was checked (five times). The times don’t coincide with checks that were made,” Evans responded. “The checks were done. The times may be inaccurate.”\nBefore resting Tuesday morning, prosecutors presented an audio interview of Evans with internal affairs officers in which she told them she “estimated” hours in which Ajibade was checked on in the restraining chair.\n“You didn’t lie about it...but this document is falsified,” Deputy Cpl. Rick Hall told Evans.\n“I estimated, I didn’t say I did the actual checks,” Evans responded. “I just estimated.”\n“You didn’t actually perform these checks even though you listed it on an official document,” Hall said.\nKenny and Evans are on trial for involuntary manslaughter for causing Ajibade’s death “without any intention to do so.” The charge said that Kenny caused the death during the commission of “reckless conduct...without intention to do so by tasing (Ajibade) while he was restrained.”\nEvans is charged with reckless conduct by failing to monitor Ajibade’s status.\nIn addition, both are charged in two separate indictments with committing perjury before the Chatham County grand jury that was hearing the case in what the state contends was part of an attempt to cover up their involvement in the death.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14766969_3_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/ajibade_3_1_0_1_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/ajibade_3_1_0_1_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14033157_2.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14033157_2.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14033152_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14033152_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14766969_3_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:11:47.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
