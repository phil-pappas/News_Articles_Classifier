That would rank second in NFL history, but Wilson is 121 attempts away from qualifying. \n\"Well, depends on who is rating it, but we rate him pretty high,\" said Seattle coach Pete Carroll when asked if Wilson was underrated as a passer. \"He's a very unique player and we try to maximize that uniqueness that he has and give him opportunity to move and do the things he does. It's become part of our scheme.\" \nWilson has completed 71.4 percent of his passes this season for 979 yards, five touchdowns and two interceptions.\"He's got a strong arm and he’s a very accurate passer in the pocket,\" said Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis. \"They do a lot in base-down situations with the hard play-actions, the nakeds, the boots and so forth on the move or in the pocket. He does a great job of recognizing the coverage and getting the ball to what they feel is the weakness of the coverage and delivering a very accurate throw, let alone when he's on the move and throws accurate balls. They had a guy come back last week from the goal line and catch the ball at the 40-yard line on one of his scrambles. Those are impressive plays for a quarterback to make, and for the receiver also, their ability to relate to him when he moves.\" \nAnother reason that Wilson is overlooked as a passer is because he doesn't throw the ball a lot. He's averaged just 26.5 attempts and only 210.2 yards per game as Seattle often plays with the lead due to its running game and outstanding defense. For comparison sake, Aaron Rodgers, who is all-time leader in career passer rating, averaged 33.1 attempts and 273.3 yards per game in his 107 career starts. \n\"This guy can throw the ball,\" Bengals defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said of Wilson. \"He's accurate. He made a throw - a scramble throw - against Chicago, it was like a 50-yard throw and the guy tipped it out of the receiver's hands, but it was a perfect throw. You couldn't have handed it to him any better. He can make all the throws. He worries me as much that ways as he does with his ability to run.\" \nThe Bengals struggled last season with dual-threat quarterback Cam Newton, who completed 29 of 46 passes for 284 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for a season-high 107 yards on 17 carries, most of which were designed running plays, as he helped the Carolina Panthers to a 37-37 tie. In fairness, Newton had been dealing with an ankle injury prior to that game and had rushed the ball only 14 times for 42 yards in the four games combined prior to facing the Bengals. \n\"That was more probably my fault, because going into that game he hadn't been running because of the bad ankle so we didn't work it on it much in practice,\" said Guenther. \"We had to get it drawn on the sideline, then had a couple of linebackers go down and had to grab guys as they were coming off special teams so they could get the adjustment. We'll be ready for what they give.\" \nWilson has been operating behind an offensive line that lost standout Max Unger in an offseason trade to New Orleans that landed standout tight end Jimmy Graham and a couple of other new starters as well. Despite his mobility he was sacked 18 times in the first four games. \n\"I think that we, just as a group, we need to keep battling together, keep learning,\" said Wilson. \"We’ll be OK. I think that's the biggest thing. We've had some tough matchups the first four games or so and this is another one. Obviously the Bengals do a lot of great stuff and fly around. The key is getting the ball out on time, taking what they give us and capitalizing on opportunities.\" \nGuenther said it will be important to not allow Wilson room to escape when a play breaks down. \n\"You just got to mix up the rush plan and the coverage plan - it's all got to fit together,\" said Guenter. \"We know he's a threat running out of the pocket so we've got to understand guys have to stay in coverage a little bit longer. We have to stay on rush a little bit longer.\" \nGuenther said it helps his unit though that not only does it have dynamic rushers from outside in ends Carlos Dunlap and Michael Johnson, but also has a great rusher on inside like tackle Geno Atkins. \n\"He'll move side to side, but when you have guys that can push the inside part of the pocket and get in the way of his throwing lanes that will help,\" he said. \nSunday will actually mark a homecoming of sorts for Wilson. He was born in Cincinnati at Christ Hospital, but he moved with his family to Richmond, Va., when he was a little over a year old. His father, Harrison, was a lawyer for Procter & Gamble, and his mother Tammy worked for the University of Cincinnati. \nWilson said he often returned to the area as a child to see other family members and friends of his parents. \n\"The nasty 'Nati - I’m excited about it,\" Wilson said. \"I haven’t been there in a while. I’ve been through there. I haven’t had a chance to go lately, but I’m excited to hopefully get some White Castles and Skyline Chili. I used to love watching the Cincinnati Reds. My dad always used to talk about the Bengals even though he was a huge Chargers fan. Growing up I used to love their jerseys.\" \nWilson was asked what he'd do in Cincinnati if he has the time after Seattle arrives? \n\"(Go see) the house I grew I up in,\" he said. \"Either the house I grew up in and/or get some Skyline Chili on the way.\" \nPhoto: AP/Darron Cummings \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:27:57.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
