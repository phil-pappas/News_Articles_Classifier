Sefolosha denied wrongdoing and was acquitted of all charges last week. \nNow, he's eager to focus on basketball again after missing the Hawks' run to the Eastern Conference final. He hopes to win a starting job at small forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:30:10.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
