He was regarded by coaches as one of their best linemen, if not the best.\n\"We felt moving forward without Jeremiah was in the best interest of our team,\" Pace said in a statement released by the team. \"We appreciate his contributions and wish him well.\"\nRatliff's apparent row with Pace on Wednesday morning was not his first run-in with team officials.\nLast Dec. 26, Ratliff caused a disturbance at what turned out to be coach Marc Trestman's final practice, and he was escorted out of the facility by team personnel. Still, he was allowed to start the season finale at the Minnesota Vikings that Sunday.\nRatliff was suspended by the NFL for the first three games of the season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. That stemmed from his guilty plea in April to a DWI charge that resulted from a crash in January 2013.\nTo replace Ratliff on the roster, the Bears signed former Pittsburgh Steelers and Jacksonville Jaguars defensive lineman Ziggy Hood.\n(Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune contributed to this story.)\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742026", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742026&h=Bears+cut+Jeremiah+Ratliff+after+argument+with+GM+Ryan+Pace", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742026&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:17:21.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
