Harrison’s first scoring pass, a 10-yard pass to junior Cole Campbell, and Jake Catarius’ two-point conversion rush gave the Lions (3-1 and in the Central Catholic Small) a 16-0 lead late in the second quarter. Lowell Catholic (1-3, 1-2 Central Catholic Small) cut the margin to 16-8 with a score just before the half off an interception but that would be all SJP II would allow. Harrison connected with junior Keith Campbell early in the fourth quarter with a 5-yard strike, giving the Lions a 22-8 lead. Senior Johnny Warden completed the scoring with an 11-yard touchdown run. Harrison got the St. John Paul II offense going with a 2-yard touchdown run in the opening quarter, hitting Warden for the two-point conversion pass and an 8-0 lead. Catarius tallied 55 yards on 10 carries while the St. John Paul II defense came a touchdown shy of its second straight shutout. Catarius had seven tackles on defense while both Cole and Keith Campbell hauled in an interception. Cohasset 21, Mashpee 6: Senior Chris Norton ran for 222 yards on 12 carries, running in a pair of scores to lead the defending Div. 6 State champion Skippers over the Falcons in Cohasset.
