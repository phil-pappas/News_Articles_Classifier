(AP) - Chris Pauling and Darius Leonard each returned interceptions for scores and Lynard Jamison had a 91-yard punt return for a touchdown to help South Carolina State beat Howard 49-10 on Saturday. \nJamison added eight receptions for 70 yards and another touchdown while Mykal Moody finished with three catches for 107 yards, including a 67-yard touchdown that gave South Carolina State (3-3, 2-1 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference) a 21-0 lead with 4:32 left in the first quarter. \nOn the first play from scrimmage, Pauling picked off a pass from Jamie Cunningham and returned it 42 yards for a score. \nAfter the teams exchanged punts, Howard (0-6, 0-4) drove to the South Carolina State 34 before a 65-yard pick-6 by Leonard gave the Bulldogs a 14-0 lead midway through the first quarter. \nHoward had just 217 total yards and is now averaging just 196.3 yards per game. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:24:06.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
