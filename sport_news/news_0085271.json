The BCCI also gave no details of the financial deal struck with Vivo, although in a statement it said the Chinese company would provide a bank guarantee for payment in the \"next 10 days\". <p>Pepsi and Coke battle for Chobani Greek yogurt</p> <p>PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are both competing for an investment in Greek yogurt maker Chobani.</p> \nHowever, reports earlier this month in the Indian Express newspaper suggested that PepsiCo had sent a termination notice to the BCCI citing issues relating to the governance of the IPL. The US group declined to comment on the document. \n\"Losing a global company like Pepsi is obviously a blow,\" said Ayaz Memon, a Mumbai-based cricket writer and commentator. \"They seem to have become fed up with these governance problems, and decided it wasn't worth the reputation problems.\" \nSince launching in 2009, the IPL has attracted huge audiences with its television-friendly shorter cricket format and showbiz razzmatazz, in turn convincing companies such as PepsiCo and UK-based telecommunications group Vodafone to sign up as sponsors as a means to connect with India's sports-mad public. \nMore from the Financial Times:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:53:37.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
