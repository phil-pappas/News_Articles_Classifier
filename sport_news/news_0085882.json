As part of an overall club makeover, the gymnasium floor was updated, and Generali's signature now graces that new floor.To celebrate the evening the guests of honor are two notable state employees. Howie Dickenman, the men's basketball coach at Central Connecticut State University, and Geno Auriemma, the women's basketball coach at the University of Connecticut, who recently made headlines with candid comments about the team's fanbase.I trust you know Geno, Howie too, from his tenure as an assistant coach for the UConn men. I am told that together on a dais Howie and Geno are the Abbott and Costello of basketball.Who's on point? What's at the line? I Don't Know's in the post.Steak and burger evenings were first launched by Mario Generali 30 years ago, and it coincided with Auriemma's arrival in Connecticut.The idea is simple: The kids of the Boys and Girls Club enjoy a fabulous steak dinner, free. The rest of us, the rich and influential, or not so rich and with little influence, donate $125 to the club and in return, get a burger.Sounds fair.The first steak and burger fundraiser was the fall of 1985. The first guest speaker at the first steak and burger, even before he won his first game, was Auriemma.\"A lot of people don't remember, but the night he came to the first Steak and Burger was his first public appearance in Connecticut after he was named head coach,\" said Ed Generali, Holy Cross High basketball coach, son to Mario and friend to Geno. \"No one knew who he was, but he became an adopted Waterburian that night. It was made clear that we accepted him, and he said that Waterbury reminded him of his hometown (Norristown, Penn.) outside of Philadelphia.\"Two components are at the core of the new Steak and Burger night. One is to remember a great man in Mario Generali, who was a member, an employee, and eventually director, for over 50 years at the Boys Club. And also, as stated by Karen Senich, the club's executive director, the plan is to reconnect the past and present.\"Since I began as executive director so many people have come up to me and said, 'I grew up there, the Boys Club saved me, I went there every day,'\" Senich said. \"Everyone has a story about the Boys Club, and they are all great stories. It was a huge part of their lives growing up. We'd like it to be a huge part of their lives as adults as well.\"Ticket information: Cost is $125 per person. Tickets are available through the Boys and Girls Club.
