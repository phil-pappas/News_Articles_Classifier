The 72-year-old Boosey will also help the AFI in identifying potential talent at the grassroots level by regularly visiting the Sports Authority of India (SAI)’s training centres, besides preparing the short-term and long-term goals for Indian athletics. Following in the footsteps of Hockey India (HI), which has chief coach Roelant Oltmans doubling up as the High Performance Director, the AFI decided to engage the USA-based Boosey for the top job to boost their medal hopes at the Olympics. The appointment has come close on the heels of the AFI bringing back Ukraine’s Yuri Ogorodnik as the chief coach of the quarter-miler teams. Boosey, who had participated in the men’s triple jump competition at the 1968 Mexico Olympics where he finished 16th, will get a remuneration of $8,500 per month. He will arrive in India next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:53:58.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
