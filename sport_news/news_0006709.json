The offense struggled all night, though, and after Utah State moved into Fresno State territory, second-string quarterback Craig Harrison's pass was intercepted to seal the game. \nIt was one of the best seasons in the Bulldogs' 47-year football history, and the Aggies did well to give themselves a chance to tie the contest late. \nIn this matchup, however, Utah State currently stands as a 12-point favorite. Fresno State has lost its last four, including double-digit defeats against conference foes San Jose State and San Diego State the past two weeks, and its lone win came in the season opener versus FCS opponent Abilene Christian. \nA crucial bounce-back victory over Colorado State helped the Aggies start MWC play on the right foot, but it wasn't enough to convince coach Matt Wells that his team is at the level it needs to be at to compete for the league title. \n\"We're still learning who we are,\" Wells said in a press conference after last week's win. \"We're still trying to find out our identity, I think, a little bit on both sides of the ball.\" \nMyers was Utah State's first 100-yard rusher in its first four games, but LaJuan Hunt and Devante Mays will likely be handed plenty of carries for one of them to break the century mark. \nOf course, with the likes of Hunter Sharp, Brandon Swindall and Devonte Robinson stretching defenses with their route-running abilities and speed, the Aggies look poised to repeat their balanced performance on offense from last week and put the Bulldogs away before the game gets late. \nFresno State was among the best teams in the country in terms of scoring and passing prior to the previous matchup, but Utah State holds a clear advantage on defense heading into Saturday. \nThe Bulldogs are third-worst out of 127 FBS teams in total offense, averaging 291.8 yards per game, while the Aggies are 30th in total defense, surrendering 323.8 yards per game. \nUtah State's second MWC game at Fresno State is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. MDT and can be seen on CBS Sports Network.
