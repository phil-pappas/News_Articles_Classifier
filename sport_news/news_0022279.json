That won't really matter, however, if they lay an egg against Vestal (4-3) in the postseason. Head coach Fred Deinhardt expects another tight game come the postseason. \n\"The guy are working hard and they're getting better. We had a lot of penalties. Penalties and mistakes add up over time and we still had mistakes (against Vestal),\" he said. \"Vestal played a tough game. Their quarterback is a great athlete and so is their fullback, so it'll be a tough game again.\" \nBefore they meet in the playoffs, Johnson City finishes the regular season at unbeaten Elmira (7-0). Vestal visits Binghamton (5-2).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:11:10.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
