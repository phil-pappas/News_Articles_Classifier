They are from three private email accounts Hayes used while acting as first lady of Oregon – \"FLO\" in her email shorthand.\nThe release follows a months-long legal fight by The Oregonian/OregonLive to force disclosure of the public records. The fight wound from the governor's office through the state Justice Department and ultimately to state court. Prall is considering a total of 28,000 emails for release, and disclosure could take up to two years.\nWhitney Boise, Portland attorney representing Hayes in the email matter, didn't respond to an email seeking comment.\nHayes didn't have a state-issued email account for her unpaid state role. Instead, she resorted to her personal email accounts during John Kitzhaber's third term as governor to communicate with his staff, other state employees and outsiders.\nSeveral emails track Hayes' efforts to establish the Oregon Prosperity Initiative, focused on reducing poverty across the state. Early in Kitzhaber's third administration, she discussed in one email launching a \"First Lady Hunger Initiative (obviously with a cooler title than that!)\"\nHer emails contain the daily chaff of being a public figure – accepting or rejecting speech engagements, asking staff to set up a meeting, accepting a gift book after messaging the author about how to get his book. In one email, Hayes let out an electronic sigh, advising one of Kitzhaber's aides she didn't really need to be consulted about which restaurant should be used for a private dinner.\nThe released emails reveal nothing on the topic that burned white hot in the final months of Kitzhaber's administration: Her work as a paid consultant for outside groups. Federal agents are investigating whether Hayes was paid to use her influence as first lady to affect state government.\nEmails have been central to the influence peddling controversy that drove Kitzhaber to resign last February.\nConspiracy theories erupted and the FBI came running when his staff sought to remove Kitzhaber's own personal emails from a state server. Kitzhaber has maintained the emails were inadvertently stored there and none of the public's business. A state worker later leaked the emails to Willamette Week, which published a series of unflattering excerpts.\nKitzhaber's staff was no less forthcoming about Hayes' emails. The Oregonian/OregonLive last October requested from his office a log of her emails relating to her public duties. Three months later, Liani Reeves, then Kitzhaber's general counsel, said that \"I continue to work with\" Hayes on the records.\nReeves never produced the log, and declined Wednesday to address written questions about whether she ever gathered the emails.\nLast December, The Oregonian/OregonLive asked Hayes directly for emails she processed as first lady. When she ignored the request, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum in February granted a petition from the news organization, ordering Hayes to turn them over.\nRather than obey, Hayes sued The Oregonian/OregonLive to stop the disclosure. She contended the public records law didn't apply to her. She also asserted her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\nAs that lawsuit unfolded, Gov. Kate Brown authorized a wholesale disclosure of 94,000 emails between Hayes and workers in the governor's office. The trove established that Hayes was far more involved in directing and executing government policy than Kitzhaber had acknowledged. The emails also revealed a first lady tasking government workers to care for her pets and run her errands.\nEven that mass release left significant gaps in Hayes' record, but Prall moved to fill it. She ordered Hayes to turn over an estimated 28,000 emails for review and appointed a retired judge to inspect one by one each email to determine whether it was public.\nThat review produced the first of a series of batches, released over Hayes' continuing objection that she was not a public official. Hayes also tried to block release of some emails the judge concluded should be public, including one because it identified the directors of a non-profit. The organization lists its directors on its website.\nThe judge expects a batch of 500 to be released every other week. At that pace, full disclosure will take a little over two years.\n -- Les Zaitz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:21:54.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
