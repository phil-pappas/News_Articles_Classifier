But we tried to make sure we took advantage of our chances. I thought we also played in our zone really hard too. The first goal, we had to play well in our zone before we brought the puck up, so I think we did well there.” \nThe Oilers rode their goal and their luck in pulling out the victory as Daniel Sedin had the miss of the year, failing to deposit the puck into an empty net in the third period. \nSedin got to the puck in the crease after his brother Henrik was stopped by Nilsson on a breakaway. Nilsson slid past the net and Daniel Sedin somehow chipped it up over the crossbar. \nThe miss kept the Oilers in the contest. \n“When you watch the top-10 misplays, sometimes you see those,” said Oilers head coach Todd McLellan. “It’s a break we needed and we took advantage of it. You don’t get those very often and that could be the only true break we get in a long, long time, but we took advantage of it.” \nThe Canucks out-shot the Oilers 34-24 in the contest and tied the game in the second period as Matt Bartkowski scored his first career goal, drifting a point-shot past Nilsson. \nBartkowski was able to find the net with centre Bo Horvat creating traffic to the left of the Oilers goaltender. \nMcLellan considered challenging the play, but video showed the puck had crossed the goal line before Horvat made contact with Nilsson. \nIn the third, after Sedin’s miss, the Canucks had a number of good chances to take the lead. Henrik Sedin found space along the left wing and snapped a shot just wide. \nLater in the period, Nilsson made a diving save on Radim Vrbata as the Canucks turned up the pressure. \nMiller kept the Oilers from stealing the contest in regulation with less than 90 seconds to play, as Yakupov took his own rebound off the end boards and came close to firing the puck through the Canucks goaltender. \nIn overtime, the first good chance fell to the Oilers as Taylor Hall and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins broke away on a two-on-one rush. Hall kept the puck and took a shot, but Miller was able to smother the puck. \nThe teams traded chances back and fourth before Sekera sent Korpikoski away with a perfectly-weighted backhand pass, 1:46 into the extra frame. \n“Overtime is tough on the goalies, because you see an odd-man rush going our way and if Miller makes the save, you know it’s going to come back to me,” Nilsson said. “It’s a lot of pressure on the goalies, but I like it, it’s fun and I think it’s entertaining for the fans too.” \nThe Oilers return home to host the Detroit Red Wings on Wednesday and the Washington Capitals on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:12:22.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
