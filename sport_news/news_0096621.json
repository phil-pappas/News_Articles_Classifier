(USA TODAY Sports Images) \nThis might have been the signature win Tom Coughlin and Giants have been looking for. \nIn what was a fun back-and-forth game, the Cowboys shot themselves in the foot one too many times, giving their NFC East division rivals a 27-20 victory. \nThe special teams for the Cowboys weren't quite as special as the special teams for the Giants, as a 100-yard kickoff return by Dwayne Harris put the Giants on top for good late in the fourth quarter before Dallas' Cole Beasley fumbled on a punt return, killing any chance of a comeback ( Beasley's wife had some words for haters after the game ). Dwayne Harris: tied Giants record for longest kickoff-return TD (100 yards- Emlen Tunnel in 1951 & Clarence Childs in 1964) &mdash; ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 25, 2015 \nNow, the Giants move to 4-3 and await the outcome of Sunday night's Eagles-Panthers game to see who is in control of the NFC East, while Dallas drops its fourth game in a row and starts praying for the return of Dez Bryant and Tony Romo. (Also: no Giant clock management snafus this time !) Three Takeaways \n1. Tempers flare on the Dallas sideline. \nDuring the Cowboys' collapse, there was some friction on the sideline, where Greg Hardy and Dez Bryant were arguing late in the game. Cowboys&#39; Dez Bryant and Greg Hardy have to be separated on sideline https://t.co/ivh22lYiaQ pic.twitter.com/jG1GPcFZgq \nThe Star-Telegram's Clarence Hill says Bryant was trying to calm Hardy down after the linebacker started ranting at the Cowboys' special teams' personnel , rather than any specific beef between the two, while coach Jason Garrett brushed it off after the game, saying there were no issues. \nAfter the game, Hardy pulled a Marshawn Lynch. \nIt's likely nothing, but losing four in a row can crack most teams. \n2. Bring in Brandon Weeden? \nMatt Cassel threw three interceptions and did not look like the temporary solution under center for the Cowboys, as they try to ride out Romo's injury. The difference between Weeden and Cassel is striking and maybe in a way you don't expect. Matt Cassel was intercepted twice in a span of 3 attempts Sunday.&#10;&#10;Brandon Weeden had 2 interceptions on 98 attempts this season. &mdash; ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 25, 2015 \nCassel was just as awful as he was in Minnesota and Buffalo. You can excuse him, to an extent, on one of the interceptions where receiver Terrance Williams didn't run hard enough on a route, which then was turned into a pick-six by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. DRC started celebrating his 58-yard pick-6 at the 40-yard line. #DALvsNYG &#10;&#10;(no @DeionSanders 2-step though) https://t.co/SSPt4s4TSl &mdash; NFL (@NFL) October 25, 2015 \nBut the other picks? Those were bad throws. Cassel may not be the worst quarterback in the NFL, but it seems as if this team might have been better with Weeden -- which I cannot believe I typed. \n3. Eli Manning got by, but still has his \"Bad Eli\" moments. \nFor a guy in the second year of a new offense, Manning looks like he hasn't improved. Actually, since the second quarter of last week's Eagles loss, this offense -- particularly Manning -- has been out of rhythm. The short, sharp passes they were using to burn the Eagles are largely gone and it's almost as if they have gone back to the Kevin Gilbride offense. \nSomething needs to change, and soon, because they can't depend on special teams and defense to bail them out each and every week. They could be in some real trouble next week in New Orleans if Drew Brees and the Saints are back on track. Stats Amazing \nSunday was a big milestone for head coach Tom Coughlin. Tom Coughlin: 100th win as Giants head coach &mdash; ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 25, 2015 \nIf the Giants miss the playoffs for the fourth year in a row, some may call for a coaching change. But those wins are meaningful for the team, so don't be surprised if Coughlin gets to write his own exit, on his own time. Fantasy Focus \nIf you got sucked into the hype around Christine Michael , you got hosed. Darren McFadden went off for 152 yards and a touchdown. You can't start McFadden next week though, because Seattle is waiting in the wings. \nThe only other notables were Jason Witten , who had six catches for 73 yards, and Terrance Williams , who had four catches for 70 yards. In a point per reception league, they at least got you double digit points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:46:50.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
