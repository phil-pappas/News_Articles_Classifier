I was just trying to stay loose.”\nWhatever Forrest did — or whatever rules he broke — helped him on Thursday during No.18 American Studies’ PSAL B playoff game against No.15 Van Buren.\nIn a game that was initially called off because of the presence of thunder and rain only to be started after both coaches agreed to play — and an obligatory phone call to the league’s baseball commissioner — Forrest pitched a complete-game two-hitter for the first playoff win in school history, a 14-2 rout by American Studies over a young Van Buren team.\nIn a rain-soaked affair at Newtown HS Field in Queens, The Eagles advanced to play either No.2 A.P. Randolph or No.31 Juan Morel next Tuesday at the higher seed’s field.\n“I wanted to play but definitely coming in and out of the dugout was difficult,” said Forrest, who walked in the two runs in the bottom of the third, when he gave free passes to five batters. “It was difficult to stay focused. I wanted to get back in there to finish it. I didn’t want to wait until next Tuesday because it’s supposed to be bad weather all week.”\nThe game almost didn’t happen because of the heavy downpour and thunder. Officials called it off just after the scheduled 3:30 p.m. start time.\nBut the groundskeeper at Newtown HS — who identified himself only as “John” — said he called PSAL commissioner Bob Pertsas and told him the field was still playable. Pertsas spoke to the umpiring crew and told them the game could start as long as it safe enough and if the coaches agreed to play, which they did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:47:36.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
