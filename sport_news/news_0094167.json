working well in a.m. and gets HOF jockey Gary Stevens.1 Just Got Lucky – Closed stoutly to gain second at 25/1 odds at Los Alamitos; if you don't think it was a fluke, she is a healthy 12/1 odds morning line today.Long Shot – 3 West Mid \nRace 2 – 6 ½ furlongs, Purse $24,000, Claiming $20,000, 3-year-olds and up4 Jonny's Choice – Exits the Seal Beach glorified starter allowance for this; his race two back was a victory fast enough to defeat these too.2 Pray Hard – Emerald Downs shipper is from a strong barn in trainer Blaine Wright; he has shipped down to SoCal with live runners and had a lot of success.Long Shot – 7 Apollo Ten \nRace 3 – 1 mile (turf), Purse $52,000, Maiden special weights, Fillies, 2-year-olds1 Sutton's Smile – When you are second by 5-lengths or more, the winner was just the best horse in the race; her turf races have been a large improvement.6 Shakti – Tries turf for the first time for trainer Peter Miller; he puts the blinkers on and we'll see if the transition is a positive one.Long Shot – 5 Adeline Moon \nRace 4 – 5 ½ furlongs, Purse $16,000, Claiming $8,000, 3-year-olds and up5 May B – Was claimed two races back by trainer Mark Glatt and unleashed a big victory in last; if he can repeat the race he'll be double tough to handle.7 The Cleaners – It was only a four horse field in last at Los Alamitos, but he ran very well still; would prefer to stalk close up and grind it out late.Long Shot – 9 Sunrise Legacy \nRace 5 – 6 furlongs, Purse $15,000, Claiming $12,500, 3-year-olds and up5 Swiss Cheese – Was claimed three races ago by trainer Steve Miyadi; is dropped way down in class where he might see a nice pace scenario to close into.1 Formally Wild – Speedball draws the rail where the best strategy may be to send hard once again; HOF trainer Jerry Hollendorfer adding blinkers on for this.Long Shot – 6 Boompa \nRace 6 – 1 mile (turf), Purse $53,000, Optional claiming $40,000, 3-year-olds and up1 Grachus the Hunter – I like the rail post in a 2-turn mile either on dirt or grass; the key for me is the short run to the first turn, chance too to save a lot of ground.7 The Gomper – This horse has absolutely underachieved, but continues to get bet for HOF trainer Jerry Hollendorfer; he tries a new pilot tonight in HOF jockey Mike Smith.Long Shot – 5 Boat Trip \nRace 7 – 6 furlongs, Purse $53,000, Optional claiming $40,000, 3-year-olds and up5 Skelton Pass – Was beaten soundly when second last time as the 4/5 odds favorite; the key is his race two back, if repeated, is fast enough to scorch earth these.4 Caminetto – This is a Bob Baffert cull, but he finally gives up and puts him in for a $40K price tag; this is the easiest test of his career, no more excuses.Long Shot – 8 Sacred Ovation \nRace 8 – 1 mile (turf), $100,000 Autumn Miss, Fillies, 3-year-olds1 Majestic Heat – HOF trainer Richard Mandella has an uncoupled entry and this filly is the higher odds at 4/1; draws the advantageous rail in a 2-turn 1-mile route.9 Singing Kitty – She has an excellent grass resume with 3-of-6 wins so far; she is a multiple stakes winner albeit she has failed in graded stakes events.Long Shot – 7 Paulina's Love \nRace 9 – 5 ½ furlongs, Purse $21,000, Maiden claiming $30,000, Fillies, 2-year-olds1 Exactamente – Taking the biggest class drop in racing from MSW to maiden claiming; hasn't taken any betting so far, but this is an incredibly soft spot for her.7 Mint Julep Taffy – Another taking the biggest class drop in racing from MSW to maiden claiming; from a very clever trainer in Molly Pearson.Long Shot – 9 Of Course It Is \nBest Bet - 1 Sutton's Smile (race 3)Santa Anita Friday - Picks/Winners/Mutuels, 15/5/$28.60;
