(AP Photo/Phil Sandlin) \nGAINESVILLE | The last time Florida faced Ole Miss, Tim Tebow produced one of the most memorable moments of his star-studded career. \nIt wasn’t a moment of triumph on the field, as so many were, but rather a moment of heartbreak, frustration and resolve. \n“To the fans and everybody in Gator Nation, I’m sorry,” an emotional Tebow said shortly after falling 31-30 to the Rebels at home on Sept. 27, 2008. “I’m extremely sorry.” \n“We were hoping for an undefeated season. That was my goal, something Florida has never done here. But I promise you one thing: A lot of good will come out of this. \n“You have never seen any player in the entire country play as hard as I will play the rest of this season, and you’ll never see someone push the rest of the team as hard as I will push everybody the rest of this season, and you’ll never see a team play harder than we will the rest of this season. God bless.” \nThe Gators would ultimately take Tebow’s words to heart, going undefeated for the rest of the season en route to the program’s third national title and second in three seasons. \nBut back then, Tebow’s reaction was a normal reaction to a Florida loss. Not to a losing season or a loss in a title game — just one loss. \nTimes have changed. \nAs Florida prepares to host Ole Miss again on Saturday, both programs are in very different places than they were on that now-famous day in 2008. \nSince Tebow’s departure after the 2009 season, UF has suffered 26 losses in its last 67 games, including four seasons with five losses or more. \nThe Gators have also had three coaches during that time frame. To put that in perspective, Florida only had three different head coaches in the two decades prior to 2010. \nMeanwhile, Ole Miss is in one of the most successful periods in program history. \nFrom 2004-2011, the Rebels only had two seasons with more than four wins. \nBut after hiring Hugh Freeze as head coach in 2012, they’ve had three consecutive seasons with seven wins or more, including a nine-win 2014 season in which the Rebels knocked off then-No. 3 Alabama. \nFreeze’s performance has been so impressive that he was one of the leading names to replace Will Muschamp as head coach at Florida before UF Athletic Director Jeremy Foley ultimately decided to hire Jim McElwain. \nNow, Ole Miss enters Saturday’s matchup as the No. 3 team in the country with national title aspirations, along with a roster that looks more similar to Tebow’s 2008 team than what people are used to seeing from the Rebels. \nFor McElwain, who faced Ole Miss every year when he was Alabama’s offensive coordinator from 2008-2011, this Rebels group isn’t even recognizable. \n“I remember when I was in the SEC a ways back and now when I see them on film, this is a totally different Ole Miss team from a talent standpoint,” McElwain said. \nAt the same time, McElwain leads No. 25 Florida — the program’s first ranking since 2013 — into the matchup as an underdog seeking relevancy. \nAs the last man to quarterback a relevant Florida team, Tebow sees progress being made. While in Gainesville as a part of “SEC Nation” last weekend, the former Heisman winner was asked how the Gators can get that relevancy back. \n“Win,” Tebow answered. “It’s crazy, but when you win, the games get even bigger. And then when you get a chance to be in those big games and you win, guess what? Everybody in the country is talking about you. Then the Swamp is what it was. The excitement is what it was. The recruits … it changes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:32:17.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
