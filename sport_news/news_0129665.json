Currently, he is an executive board member of the Japanese Olympic Committee. \nThe agency will allocate funds to train Japanese athletes for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics and also encourage more people to play sports as a way to improve community health. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:49:38.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
