Then it was shortened to Rete,” Gonzalez Iglesias said. \nAnd so the list goes on. \nProp Juan Figallo is named after a children’s cartoon dragon “Chipi” because his rugby player father had that name. Tomas Lavanini is known as “Tongue” because he does not talk much. \nJuan Martin Hernandez has acquired the name “El Mago”, or The Magician, because of his skills. \nOnly Juan Pablo Socino and Marcos Ayerza have more traditional rugby names. \nSocino is called “Matmut” or Mammoth, because of his 110kg physique. \nLeicester prop Ayerza is “Toro”, or Bull, because he is good in the scrum. \nPablo Matera has the sobriquet, “Loco”, or Mad, but everyone insists it is meant in a nice way.
