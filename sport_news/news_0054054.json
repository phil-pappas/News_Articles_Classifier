The Dolphins played in London yesterday and were dominated by the New York Jets 27-14. \nPhilbin, who was named the permanent coach in 2012 after serving as an interim following the firing of Tony Sparano, has a contract through 2016. The Dolphins have been outscored 91-48 during the losing streak. \nItâ€™s been a tough start to the season for the Dolphins and their fans, who had high hopes for the season and who many felt would be a playoff contender. But Miami currently ranks 23rd in total offense and 30th in total defense. \nTight ends coach Dan Campbell is expected to coach the Dolphins for the remainder of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:55:20.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
