Wynn, however, said River Ridge (0-7, 0-4) still has plenty to play for. “You want to play for your seniors now, and I think all our guys want to see the seniors go out strong,” he said. “It would be nice to string together a few wins here at the end for them. It’s definitely important to try to get some wins and get some momentum rolling into your offseason.”Whether or not River Ridge can get its breakthrough may depend on which Cass team shows up tonight. The Colonels have been inconsistent, beating subregion leader Dalton 23-8 last month and losing to Sequoyah 24-3 just two weeks later.Wynn said those results mean River Ridge has to be ready to face a tough opponent, but it’s also a sign the game is winnable. “We’re going to approach it the same way we would any game,” he said. “Obviously, they have the talent to beat anybody in the region. Dalton is sitting at the top right now, and (Cass) crushed Dalton. Of course, looking at them, you have to say that, on any given night, they can beat any given team, but the same goes for us. Any night, we should be able to step up and take these guys on.”Getting off to a fast start would be helpful for the Knights, but it has not been the biggest issue this season. River Ridge has held early leads, or at least stayed competitive in the first half, of most of its games this season, only to see the opposition pull away late. Wynn said rectifying that shortcoming has been a major point of emphasis in recent weeks.“How do we finish games better? That’s the golden question right now,” he said. “We’re trying to figure that out ourselves. We’re evaluating some of the things that we’re doing just to see if we can sustain some things. It seems like we have some good plans going into our games, but we have to be better at making some adjustments later on in the games.”Holding leads is difficult with a defense giving up 44.7 points per game, so Wynn said it will be up to his offense to help make things easier. Quarterback Marcus Spears, running back Tremain Carr and receiver Davis Polley will again lead an offense whose goal will be to stay on the field and chew up clock. “We just want to limit our turnovers, get first downs and keep ourselves in good field position,” Wynn said. “We want to play on their side of the field and keep our defense on the sideline. You can’t have a lot of three-and-outs with a bunch like them, or you’ll find yourself in a tight spot. We need to convert in crucial downs and keep ourselves away from penalties as much as possible to stay out from behind the chains.”When the River Ridge defense is on the field, it will have its hand full stopping a Cass attack that spreads the ball around to its myriad of playmakers.“We have to play sound, fundamental football,” Wynn said. “It always comes back to tackling. We just have to make the plays when we have the opportunities. We have to stay disciplined in the secondary. They like to run a lot of play-action and misdirection stuff, so we have to make sure we’re reading our keys and making the plays.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:07:46.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
