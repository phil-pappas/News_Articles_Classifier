Falmouth did not have a corner in the game. The Dolphins (5-3-1, 3-1-1 ACL) swarmed the Clipper end of the field especially in the first half. In the game, D-Y had 15 corners, but the Falmouth defense, anchored by goalie Molly Duff-Still as well as the back line of Hannah Callahan, Chloe Crago, Rachel Curtis and Kate Hamilton, managed to keep the visitors off the board. Duff-Still, a junior, recorded her fourth shutout of the season while making seven saves between the Clipper pipes. Next up for the Clippers is a Wednesday non-league match at home against arch-rival Barnstable while the Dolphins next take the field Monday on the road at Nantucket. Martha’s Vineyard 4, Nantucket 0: Lacey Dinning scored a pair of goals and older sister Belle added a goal in the Vineyarders shutout win over the Whalers in Oak Bluffs. Julia Bettencourt earned the shutout in goal for Martha’s Vineyard (6-2-1), which is three points away from a South Sectional qualifying berth after the victory. Juniper Ezanno scored just six minutes in as Belle Dinning doubled the lead merely four minutes later. Lee Hayman assisted both, sending in a beautiful corner to Dinning as the Vineyarders took a 2-0 advantage to the half. Lacey Dinning then scored her two goals, her first off an assist from sister Belle and her second on a pass from Ginny Kent. Martha’s Vineyard also got strong play on defense from Emma Caron and in the midfield from Kyle Hatt. Nantucket drops to 5-5.

Luiz Terragno gave Nantucket (7-0-1) a 1-0 lead just 15 minutes in, scoring on a Renaldo Powell pass, before Jordi’s goal tied things up later in the half.
