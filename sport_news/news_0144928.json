(AP) - San Jose Sharks forward Raffi Torres will not appeal his 41-game suspension for an illegal check to the head of Anaheim’s Jakob Silfverberg in a preseason game. \nThe NHLPA said Wednesday that Torres will not contest the longest suspension in NHL history for a hit on another player. \nThis marks the fifth and most significant suspension for Torres in his career. His previous longest ban had been a 21-game suspension - initially 25 games - for a high hit on Chicago’s Marian Hossa in the first round of the playoffs in 2012 when he played for Arizona. \nTorres was suspended for the final six games of the playoffs in 2013 with San Jose for a hit to the head against Los Angeles’ Jarret Stoll. Torres was also suspended for two games in January 2012 and April 2011 for hits. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:24:42.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
