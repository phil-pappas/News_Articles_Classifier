The 6-5, 250 pound senior plays linebacker and tight end for the Yellow Jackets, but he does a bit of everything though. Berner averages nearly nine yards a carry and 22 yards a reception. He has scored five touchdowns through five games this season. Defensively, Berner has 33 tackles, two interceptions, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Berner and the 5-0 Jackets host Carmi-White County Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:54:09.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
