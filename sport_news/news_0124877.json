USC coach Steve Sarkisian has taken a leave of absence from the program at the request of athletic director Pat Haden, and reports are linking him to multiple incidents of heavy drinking.\nSarkisian’s Trojans lost to Washington, his previous team, 17-12, at home on Thursday night, and he did not show up for an afternoon practice Sunday.\nThe Los Angeles Daily News reported that players said they smelled alcohol on Sarkisian's breath during a team meeting Sunday morning.\n“I called Steve and talked to him,” Haden told reporters. “It was very clear to me that he is not healthy. I asked him to take an indefinite leave of absence.”\nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton was named the interim head coach.\nThe Los Angeles Daily News also reported that assistant coaches pulled Sarkisian out of a player huddle on the sideline during the Arizona State game on Sept. 26. The coaches reportedly believed he was not sober.\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images Sarkisian is ‘not healthy’ according to AD Pat Haden. Sarkisian and USC had said the coach was undergoing treatment, but the type was not specified.\nThe treatment dated back to shortly after he addressed USC supporters with slurred speech during a football pep rally on Aug. 22.\nGoing through the schedule, Sarkisian said several opposing teams \"suck.\" He also used an expletive prior to the rallying phrase \"Fight On.\"\nSarkisian issued an apology on USC's athletic department website a day later.\n\"I sincerely apologize to my players and staff and to our fans for my behavior and my inappropriate language at our kickoff event Saturday night,\" Sarkisian said. \"I have a responsibility to all of them and I let them down. Pat Haden talked to me after the event about my actions and I assured him this will not happen again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:10:57.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
