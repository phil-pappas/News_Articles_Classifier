I think he knows that I am pulling for him and the program.\" That goes without saying, since Paulsen and Davis are part of the Bucknell basketball family. Davis was an assistant under former head coach Pat Flannery from 2003-08, while Paulsen was the head coach for the Bison for seven years before he was named the head coach at George Mason University of the Atlantic 10 Conference after last season. Paulsen said he will surely follow Bucknell boxscores this season and is pulling for Davis, a former head coach at Division III Randolph-Macon in Virginia. But Paulsen also doesn’t want to go overboard in reaching out to Davis. \"By the same token he needs to grow his own program,\" said Paulsen, who took Bucknell to two NCAA appearances and two trips to the NIT. The first-year head coach at George Mason certainly has plenty of work to do in Northern Virginia. The Patriots were 9-22 overall and 4-14 in the Atlantic 10 last season, and that led to the dismissal of former head coach Paul Hewitt, who was relieved of his duties with one year left on his contract. The Patriots are picked to finish last in the 14-team Atlantic 10 by at least one major preseason publication. George Mason will open regular-season play at home Nov. 13 against Colgate, another Patriot League program. \"Dave is a proven winner and outstanding basketball mind,\" Mason athletic director Brad Edwards, a former defensive back for the Washington Redskins, said when Paulsen was hired. \"He is a well-respected recruiter and a developer of talent.\" Paulsen was named the Mason head coach in late March and will have to deal with the loss of three players who transferred, including Trey Porter (now at Old Dominion) and Isaiah Jackson (Providence). Mason recently began practice and so far Paulsen is pleased — mostly. \"I like their work ethic,\" he said, sitting in his office one recent morning at EagleBank Arena. \"I like the buy-in we have had to this point. We are going to be big; we are more experienced up front. I would hope it would make us a really good rebounding team.\" Mason was 13th in turnovers and 14th in assists last year in the conference. \"I think last year’s team would be playing really well and then have these droughts of ineffectiveness,\" he said. \"We have tried to attack that. I have seen that in practice. We need to be more consistent in terms of focus level. We are a long way from where we need to be. We have freshmen who will see time on the perimeter and handling the ball.\" George Mason returns several starters, including pro prospect Shevon Thompson — a 6-foot-11 center who averaged a double-double last year with 12.5 points and 11.3 rebounds per outing. \"What I like is he is very coachable and he is very receptive,\" Paulsen said of Thompson. \"I am his fourth coach in four years. He has worked really hard. He is a big guy with a huge motor.\" Another returning player is senior guard Patrick Holloway, who averaged 10.9 points per game last season but has been inconsistent at times in three years in Fairfax. \"I have been pleased,\" Paulsen said. \"After some bumps in the road, he has responded. He has the charisma to be a leader. But you have to back that up with consistency\" on the court. Paulsen played at Division III Williams and was a head coach at Le Moyne and St. Lawrence before he got his first head coaching job at the Division I level with Bucknell. The biggest challenge was to uproot his family. Paulsen and his wife, Kathy, have three daughters: One is in college at Dickinson in Carlisle while his younger two have enrolled at Flint Hill, a private school in Northern Virginia. The family is renting a home in Fairfax County as they decide what community they may want to buy a house in. \n\"It was really hard to leave Bucknell,\" Paulsen said. \"It was such a great place. This was an unbelievable opportunity for me. I almost didn’t accept (the Mason job) since I was so connected with the university and how connected our family was at Lewisburg. I think about (the Bucknell players) all of the time.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:30:29.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
