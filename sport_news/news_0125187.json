While there's a reverence for classics from the glass and screen — the menu includes a Sazerac and Old Fashioned; Janet Gaynor keeps vigil from a large portrait across the room — it's not so black and white. The team at Barlow, which opened about a year ago near the South Park Blocks, its name blazoned in bright lights on the wall, has also studied up on modern craft cocktail trends. There are smoked herbs, unusual bitters and a red pepper reduction. There's nitro-muddled mint in their julep twist. One drink, the Garden Variety, includes a watermelon shrub, a tomato granita and a mint cordial. In addition to the Old Tom gin and lime, that's a lot of ambition. Maybe too much? For me, the balsamic vinegar in the shrub overwhelmed the drink. Things got better when I headed back in time: A Tom Collins and Kir Royale were balanced and timeless, like the stars on the walls.\nOrder this: A classic from the menu or your own pick: How about an elegant French 75, with gin, lemon, sugar and Champagne?\n737 S.W. Salmon St., 503-227-0705, barlowpdx.com\n-- Colin Powers\nNo. 11: Hamlet\nPork of ages\nTo drink, to eat ... perchance to dream? Chef Cathy Whims, bar manager Ryan Magarian and restaurateur Kurt Huffman have Shakespeare-size ambitions for their little corner of the Pearl District. After giving us Oven & Shaker — a 50-50 kitchen-bar partnership — a couple of years back, they've done it again, and in stumbling distance, with Hamlet. In place of Oven & Shaker's pizza, Hamlet lives up to its name as a porcine paradise, from domestic ham to jamón ibérico. That pricey pig and several sherry cocktails hint at a Spanish accent. But the best drink evokes the Italian antipasti of melon draped in prosciutto: the gin-honeydew-lemon concoction Meat v. Melon. That seems like a mismatch, but melon wins this round, with dried prosciutto serving as garnish, though a nice salty one. Other signature drinks proved strong, though the pungent carrot-vodka mix Thumper's Revenge should be reserved for horseradish junkies. Hamlet is one of the year's most stylish new bars, with comfy banquettes, gorgeous tile and Whims-ical pig accents, like the pint-sized porker holding aloft a skull on their sign, promising \"cocktails, beer and swine.\" The trio, despite the tragic nature of their namesake, were clearly having fun when they put this concept together. You likely will, too.\nOrder this: Melon v. Meat: It's everything you'd hope for in a cocktail to complement ham.\n232 N.W. 12th Ave., 503-241-4009, hamletpdx.com\n-- Colin Powers\nNo. 10: Paydirt\nDirt don't hurt\nIf The Old Gold is any indication, Paydirt, the bourbon haven's new sister bar in The Zipper, off Northeast Sandy and 28th Avenue, is about to strike gold. At night, towering shelves of whiskey emit a warm copper glow over the 50-foot-long bar, tufted booths and a vintage phone booth where you can order Champagne. On a coaster, Smokey the Bear, retiring his namesake hat for a Paydirt one, advises \"only you can prevent Fireball.\" Like its sister bar, Paydirt is heavy on the whiskey (and whisky), with more than 100 different bottles, any of which can be turned into a pickleback with a $1 shot of Picklopolis brine. Cocktails, though often a smidge too sweet, range from brown, bitter and stirred to spicy tequila refreshers and junior Ramos Gin Fizzes. Beer buffs will feel at home, too, with 12 taps pouring everything from Rainier to Union Jack IPA. There's even a line dedicated to the Fernet Branca lover in your life.\nOrder this: Whisk(e)y\n2724 N.E. Pacific Street, 503-233-3655, paydirtbar.com\n-- Samantha Bakall\nNo. 9: The Loyal Legion\nPass it around\nOn paper, this is a no brainer. A massive Southeast Portland beer bar pouring 99 taps, all from Oregon (better luck next time, 'Couv) with a tiny kitchen pumping out hot dogs and brats from Portland's premier sausage makers, Olympia Provisions. In practice, the experience is a bit more complicated. Not all 99 beers are always available, what you order off the iPad menu doesn't always match what you're given (that sure is a pale stout!) and the buns wrapping those sausages have a bad habit of disintegrating halfway through. Still, even 75 taps of Oregon beer is impressive, especially with the Loyal Legion mixing crowd pleasers with more obscure brews, including whole sections devoted to on-trend styles including saisons, sours and, on our most recent visit, a seasonals selection devoted to festbiers. Stop by on a Friday or Saturday night, when the bar stools and blue booths at this former Police Athletic Association building are jammed with beer lovers, and you get the sense that The Loyal Legion has already accomplished what it set out to do: Blend a Euro-style beer hall with Oregon craft beer, creating a distinctly Portland bar. Now excuse us while we check in on UnTapped.\nOrder this: A nicely browned frankfurter and a tall glass of Loyal Legion's own beer, a Berlinerweiss made in collaboration with Uptown Brewing.\n710 S.E. Sixth Ave., 503-235-8272, loyallegionpdx.com\n-- Michael Russell\nNo. 8: P.R.E.A.M.\nPizza Party\nWhat started as a bass heavy, hip-hop-fueled pizza pop-up (the name P.R.E.A.M. should ring a bell with Wu-Tang Clan fans) from former Ned Ludd duo Nick Ford and Brandon Gomez became a full-fledged pizzeria earlier this year, setting up shop in the former Tennessee Red's space on Southeast 11th Avenue. Though the focus here is pizza in a raucous atmosphere -- amps have already blown -- the kitschy cocktail list deserves some serious props. Unlike many menus shaking and stirring riffs on classic cocktails, P.R.E.A.M. channels their inner child with alcoholic spins on nostalgic, soda fountain flavors. Pop a cap on one of the restaurant's bottled cocktails which come in flavors like PREAM BC, where bourbon meets housemade cola, or the Bitter Truth, made with Campari, Yellow chartreuse, Cynar and orange liqueur. Close out dinner with a root beer flip, a frothy, milkshake-lite version of a root beer float, where bourbon is shaken with Dr. McGillicuddy's Root Beer Liqueur, cream, root beer and an optional whole egg to make you feel like a kid again.\nOrder this : Bottled cocktails or bust.\n2131 S.E. 11th Ave., 503-231-2809, preampizza.com\n-- Samantha Bakall\nNo. 7: Smokehouse Tavern\nBourbon club\nIt's right there in the name. Smokehouse Tavern, the sister bar to Northwest Portland's compact Smokehouse 21, adds a bar in chef B.J. Smith's barbecue. Even if you're not high on the Smith's brisket, this long bar has a lot to offer, including some delicious bar snacks, great cocktails and a large flatscreen TV where the Portland Timbers trump everything, even the NBA playoffs. The secret weapon here is the cocktail program, with classics and originals designed by Rum Club honcho Michael Shea. You can sit at the tchotchke-backed bar and order a few oyster shooters alongside the Old Pal, a Boulevardier variation that does its Negroni roots proud, or crunch through some pig ear rinds while sipping the Smokehouse Old Fashioned, with bourbon, maple syrup and house BBQ bitters. Better yet, pair the decadent deviled eggs, each stuck with a slice of hot link, with the Little Honda, a refreshing margarita variation made with cucumber syrup. Not surprisingly, the best way to enjoy this tavern is at the bar.\nOrder this: Deviled eggs and a Little Honda.\n1401 S.E. Morrison St., 971-279-4850, smokehouse21.com\n-- Michael Russell\nNo. 6: The Green Room\nThe opening act\nIn showbiz, a green room provides a relaxing place to hang out before the bright lights of a TV show or theater. So it goes with the Green Room, a new space that functions both as its own bar and a waiting room for the Multnomah Whiskey Library. It's a status symbol when restaurants can open adjunct bars to sip away the wait: Think Beast with Expatriate. But it's unusual when a bar grows so popular it needs an auxiliary lounge. With the Green Room, perched beside the Library's stairway, there's no doubt it's the opening act. The doorman even inquires whether you'll make your way upstairs. And you should. But this newcomer has its own pleasures, foremost the same quality service, attention to detail and a list of aperitifs and sherry cocktails opening the palate for more spirituous adventures upstairs. One area where the Green Room is never second-best is in its verdant hue: From wide swaths of green tile to small accents, it feels like Kermit the Frog went wild, and it works. But St. Patrick's Day aside, it's bound to pale in the shadow of the Library's ornate art direction and liquor wonderland. So why does it cost the same?\nOrder this: Stay on theme and invite the Green Fairy for a visit with an absinthe frappe: Verte absinthe, lime, mint, sugar and sparkling water over shaved ice.\n1122 S.W. Alder St., 503-954-1381, mwlpdx.com\n-- Colin Powers\nNo. 5: Sandy Hut\nTrue grit\nFew bars in Portland have a better sense of place than the Sandy Hut, which for decades lived as a grimy dive in the armpit of Northeast Sandy Boulevard and 14th Avenue. Earlier this year, the team behind Club 21 and Gold Dust Meridian bought the 92-year-old bar, a one-time haunt for Elliott Smith, breathing new life into the space. Though the bones are mostly the same -- the old Al Hirschfield celebrity caricatures still hang on the wood-paneled wall -- this reincarnation is better than we could have wished for. The sports memorabilia and TVs are gone, replaced with framed photos and tchotchkes, but the vintage charm remains. Saddle up to the same, bracket-shaped bar for something from the new menu, a Polynesian island fantasia with mid-century roots. There are still tallboys and burgers, but there's also a Crab Louie, teriyaki chicken skewers and daily food specials like prime rib and snow crab legs (!!), along with craft taps and enjoyably sweet, island-inspired cocktails. There's a lot less neon, it's a bit less gritty, but it's still the Sandy Hut.\nOrder this: A Mai Tai and snow crab legs (Thursday, only).\n1430 N.E. Sandy Blvd., 503-235-7972\n-- Samantha Bakall\nNo. 4: Shift Drinks\nLast call\nHow do you categorize a bar that offers a little bit of everything? Shift Drinks, from cocktail champ Alise Moffatt (Angel Face, Multnomah Whiskey Library) and advanced sommelier Anthony Garcia (MWL, Noisette), transformed a cavernous West End office space into a minimalist, Art Deco watering hole that's equal parts after-hours cocktail bar, wine lovers paradise, quietly chill beer bar and gluten-free-friendly cider and sake spot. Sip on a kooky-colored, spirit-forward cocktail like the electric blue Singapura, made with vodka, lemon, blue Curaçao, Maraschino and Ricard. Go cheap, white and delicious with a rotating wine pick, or dive into the 100 bottle-deep list of old and new world varietals. So Belgian blonde ales are your thing? That's cool, too. After work, you'll find rub elbows with smartphone-addicted 9-5ers plugged into the bar's many outlets. After dark, the cavernous space turns into a hangout for bar industry royalty.\nOrder this: Wine. Or beer. Or the Physically Forgotten cocktail, with gin, Cynar, Maraschino, bitters and lemon oil, along with some of the affordable and relatively healthy bar snacks.\n1200 S.W. Morrison St., 503-922-3933, shiftdrinkspdx.com\n-- Samantha Bakall\nNo. 3: La Moule\nTrappist queen\nChef Aaron Barnett must have gotten homesick. A year and a half after his beloved Lyonnaise bouchon relocated west of the river, Barnett and former St. Jack bartender Tommy Klus opened the chic La Moule just four blocks from their old home. La Moule's main game is beautiful mussels, frites and Belgian beers, though a handful of St. Jack favorites make appearances. Klus, the whisky-savvy bartender behind the openings of Kask and Multnomah Whiskey Library, has built an approachable cocktail menu (drinks cost between $8-$10) with a European accent. Go French with the anise-forward A Niece Frappe, an icy, aperitif cocktail made with Ricard Pastis, lemon, mint and Peychaud's bitters, or Spanish with the mahogany-colored Lilah, mixing Oloroso sherry, Mellow Corn, Chartreuse and whiskey barrel bitters. Feeling more authentic? Stay true with a brew from the Belgian-centric beer list, which includes taps from St. Bernardus (Abt 12) and Liefmans (Goudenband) and bottles from Westmalle, Rochefort and more.\nOrder this: A Niece Frappe and a bowl of the moules mariniere with frites.\n2500 S.E. Clinton St., 971-339-2822, lamoulepdx.com\n-- Samantha Bakall\nNo. 2: Victoria Bar\nTrue love\nLighting Bar Collective, the closest thing Portland's bar scene has to a Supergroup, looks to have a hit on their hands with Victoria. This North Portland charmer, a collaboration between bartender Lisa Hare and the collective, which features owners from The Bye and Bye, Dig A Pony, Jackknife and The Sweet Hereafter, took over the one-time Trebol space in July, expanding the dining room, adding a towering white bar and improving the already pleasant patio. Most nights, the bar fills with noisy crowds by 6 p.m., with bartenders sporting vintage cloche hats or colorful sleeve tattoos pouring beer into frosty steins. Inconceivably, Victoria's cocktails are inspired top-to-bottom by cult fantasy film \"The Princess Bride,\" including the Six Fingered Man, a citrusy beer cocktail made with rum and IPA, and the Murdered by Pirates, a muscular blend of scotch, rum and falernum. The Battle of Wits includes whiskey, dry vermouth, peach, black pepper and, blessedly, no iocane powder. There's food, too, including a small selection of southern coastal dishes like the low country boil, a one-pot mix of shrimp, kielbasa, potatoes and corn, plus several vegan-friendly options (buffalo-fried cauliflower po'boy, anyone?) and a pimento mac and cheese that's almost worth a visit on its own.\nOrder this: The Six Fingered Man and some pimento mac.\n4835 N. Albina Ave., victoriapdx.com\n-- Michael Russell\nNo. 1: Bit House Saloon\nPortland's best new bar\nIn a year of new bars that showed more promise than execution, Bit House Saloon seems to have come into the Portland bar world fully formed. Even on opening day, Bit House — which took over a historical building in the buzzing central eastside restaurant district — felt not like a new bar, but the best long-time Portland watering hole that you hadn't yet discovered.\nA visit two months later confirmed our suspicions, and Bit House's strengths: Warm, welcoming decor, superlative hospitality, good music and a creative drink menu that yielded superior beverages. Bit House Saloon proved our easy choice for Portland's best new bar.\nPerhaps most striking, Bit House feels like a fanciful rejection of a craft cocktail movement that had become too self-serious. You know, those well-meaning but ponderous bars with terse, we-know-what's-best-for-you drink lists, a narrow selection that too often plays to a brown-and-bitter palate geared to what's preferred by bartenders, not their customers. Thanks, but we'll pass on that quaff of Fernet, chamomile shrub and smoked bitters.\nJesse Card, bar manager at Bit House, shows he's the master of this high-low art, balancing craft cocktail refinement with dive bar joie de vivre. Here, there's room for single barrel spirits and machines that churn out adult slushies, classics like Manhattans and Old Fashioneds offered alongside casual sippers on tap, a one-buck pony of Miller High Life and a sherry program, all served up in an atmosphere of spirituous joy rather than somber reverence. You can have your boozy popsicle and eat it, too.\nWe had no doubt the Bit House team could knock the signature cocktails out of the park, but quirky drinks can be harder to pull off. Luckily, the banana colada arrived creamy and rum-forward rather than saccharine and headache-inducing. Cocktails on draft can lack balance because of the technical challenges, but several hit the spot on a hot day, from a refreshing blueberry bramble with gin, Oregon berries and a mountain of crushed ice, to a cooler referred to as a tiki drink made with vodka (bartenders, it's not a scary word!), accented with watermelon, falernum, lemon and pineapple gomme syrup. Garnishes were not neglected. A mint sprig was spritzed with aerosolized absinthe and dusted with powdered sugar.\nCard got a chance to draft a blueprint of sorts while working at the Knock Back on Northeast Alberta Street, a rollicking bar that appeared in last year's top 10 list. Brought in by Robert Kowalski and Jayson Criswell, whose rehab projects include Southeast Porland's Lutz Tavern, Card has plenty of help with a team of bartenders who have put in the hard hours at bars such as Teardrop Cocktail Lounge and Raven & Rose, including Chauncey Roach of the Fireside and Ración. From the kitchen side, you can come early for happy hour nibbles like biscuits with butter and radishes or make a dinner out of their twists on pub fare, which include an elk burger, a rabbit hand pie and popcorn-crusted Rocky Mountain Oysters (make sure to Google it first if you're in the dark).\nThe former home of East Bank Saloon offered the perfect space for these bartenders to show off their creativity — a building that dates back to 1896 and has played host to a number of businesses over the decades. Even with a makeover from Elk Collective, the design team behind Multnomah Whiskey Library, you can feel the history in the brick walls and accents that remained, such as chandeliers and sconces. During our first visit, an old phone booth got a 21st century application as one bar-goer posed inside for a selfie.\nThe saloon, at the corner of Southeast Grand Avenue and Morrison Street, offers an array of spaces to fit your mood: a lively bar with comfy chairs tucked in the corners, a larger area good for groups, an intimate side room perfect for hiding out, a patio for those warmer days before winter sets in. It's a setting that encourages you to relax a while, though you may be tempted to explore the bustling neighborhood.\nThe central eastside may be Portland's hottest district for food and drink, with new places popping up regularly. While Bit House is a cocktail destination, blocks away the Loyal Legion, also making our top 12 list of new bars , draws masses of beer lovers. Across the street from Bit House, you'll find hipster hangout Dig a Pony and Kachka, our 2015 Rising Star restaurant and a wonderland for vodka enthusiasts. With an easy walk you can also find Trifecta Tavern, Rum Club, Slow Bar and Cooper's Hall.\nBit House may be a newcomer to the neighborhood, but it feels like it's always been here.\nOrder this: If you're interested in checking out their single barrel collection in a cocktail, go for the Bit House Manhattan (with Weller Special Reserve) or Bit House Old Fashioned (Buffalo Trace). Or try them out on their own in a flight.\n727 S.E.
