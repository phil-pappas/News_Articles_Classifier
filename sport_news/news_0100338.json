That’s terrible news for the Chiefs, since he’s the engine of their offense. Charles has turned in three straight 1,000-yard seasons and was averaging 5.1 yards a game through five games when he was injured. Second-year running back Charcandrick West has stepped in as the starter for Charles.\nHouston, we have a problem\nOutside linebacker Justin Houston led the NFL last year with 22 sacks. He’s not quite on that pace this year, but he’s still having a very good season. He entered Sunday’s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers with four sacks. Opponents clearly have paid a lot more attention to Houston this year and before Sunday, Houston wasn’t even his team’s sack leader. That honor went to defensive end Allen Bailey.\nMr. Smith goes to London\nChiefs quarterback Alex Smith — the No. 1 overall pick in 2005, the same year Aaron Rodgers was picked 24th overall — is the quintessence of a game manager. Smith has never thrown for more than 3,300 yards and his accuracy hovers around the low 60% range. But he always rarely throws interceptions. In the past four seasons, Smith hasn’t thrown more than seven picks in a year. But Smith also takes a pounding, holding the ball a little too long sometimes. Before Sunday, Smith had been sacked 23 times, third highest in the NFL.\nPeters' pick party\nRookie cornerback Marcus Peters entered Sunday second in the AFC with three interceptions and returned one for pick for a touchdown, after he hauled in one of Peyton Manning’s wounded ducks and returned it 55 yards. Peters has had a strong season and is in the conversation for NFL rookie of the year honors.\nAFC West chumps?\nIn 2011, the Lions swept the AFC West and then-coach Jim Schwartz was only too happy to point out that his team owned the AFC West that year. This year, it’s a bit different. The Lions are trying to avoid being swept by the AFC West. They’re already 0-2 after their opening-game loss against the San Diego Chargers and their Sunday night loss to the Denver Broncos. This time they get an international audience for their game against the Chiefs and then take on the not-quite-horrible Oakland Raiders at Ford Field Nov. 22.\nContact Carlos Monarrez: cmonarrez@freepress.com.
