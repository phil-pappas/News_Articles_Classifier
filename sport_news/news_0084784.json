The Jaguars improved to 7-0 and held onto their perch atop standings in Brooklyn ‘A’ West. In most basketball games, a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter would be considered pretty safe. And normally, when that lead has been built via a 17-0 run, the momentum all but puts the game out of hand.\nBut even with his team’s sizable advantage, Global Studies & International Studies basketball coach John Templeton knew that Banneker, the Jaguars’ opponent on Wednesday, wouldn’t quit.\nHe knew his opponent well.\nAgainst all odds, the host Warriors raged back, tying the game and sending it to overtime.\nFortunately for Templeton, his Jaguars displayed the same persistence – holding on to gut out a 71-66 overtime victory to safeguard their standing atop the PSAL Brooklyn ‘A’ West.\n“This team has been trying to work on unity … for the whole year,” Templeton said of his team’s performance. “And we’re still working on it. It’s getting better.”\nGlobal Studies held a 29-28 lead at halftime, but early in the third quarter the Jaguars really began to take control.\nBryan Pace/Bryan Pace for News Isaias Orbay (r.) and his Global Studies teammates celebrate their bracing overtime victory at Banneker Academy on Wednesday. The Jaguars improved to 7-0 and held onto their perch atop standings in Brooklyn ‘A’ West. Usually, the Jaguars’ (7-0) bread and butter is getting the ball to 6-8 center Arkeem Joseph ; On Wednesday, they found him double-covered under the basket and turned to junior Kyle Giddings instead.\nGiddings, their other big man, totaled 22 points during the game, including six in the third quarter.\n“All my coaches told me to keep on going down low,” Giddings said. “Get aggressive with them, because I know they’ve got no bigs.”\nBanneker’s lack of a big man is a temporary problem. The Warriors’ center and top scorer, Malichi West, is out for three weeks due to a foot contusion.\nWith 7:28 left in the fourth quarter, the Warriors (5-1) stopped the bleeding by scoring a basket to make the score 50-35. That’s when Banneker gave the Jaguars a taste of their own medicine.\nBanneker coach Wendell Saunders implemented a man-to-man press that devastated the Jaguars offense.\nBryan Pace/Bryan Pace for News Isaias Orbay (r.) and his Global Studies teammates celebrate their bracing overtime victory at Banneker Academy on Wednesday. The Jaguars improved to 7-0 and held onto their perch atop standings in Brooklyn ‘A’ West. Templeton said his team’s greatest problem has been changing its strategy to counter an effective defensive scheme.\n“They weren’t setting the screens properly, and they weren’t getting each other free,” the coach added.\nThe Warriors stole the ball an astonishing nine times in the fourth quarter, ultimately tying the game with 2:20 to play after a pair of looping 3-pointers from sharpshooter Prince-Jov Antoine (23 points).\nWith just over a minute remaining, Banneker took a 60-58 lead off its ninth and final steal of the quarter.\nAfter Global Studies tied it again, Banneker’s Lynden Parkinson had a one-and-one opportunity at the line with 8.4 seconds to play. He couldn’t convert, and the game went to overtime at 60-60.\nThe Jaguars, however, refused to sit down. It was point guard Milton Faison that took over in the extra session, scoring four points and leading his team to victory. He finished with 17 points total.\n“We knew it was going to be a battle out there,” Faison said. “We just maintained our composure.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:27:24.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
