Patriots 3-0 (1) : Some have already started wondering if they can go 16-0 again. No joke. Their three opponents so far are 5-1 in other games.\n2. Packers 3-0 (2) : Made it look easy against a talented Chiefs defense. Too easy.\n3. Broncos 3-0 (4) : Crazy to say, but they're going to go as far as the defense carries Peyton Manning.\n4. Cardinals 3-0 (5) : They're not just winning, they're mauling opponents by channeling Bruce Arians' message.\n5. Bengals 3-0 (6) : Made believers out of many with a gritty win against a desperate Ravens bunch.\n6. Steelers 2-1 (7) : It will be interesting to see how the loaded offense performs for Todd Haley with Michael Vick playing in place of Big Ben for at least a few weeks.\n7. Panthers 3-0 (8) : Jared Allen is a small Band-Aid with pass rusher Charles Johnson potentially on the shelf for quite some time.\n8. Seahawks 1-2 (9) : The Bears' weak pass rush exposed an offensive line with issues.\n9. Falcons 3-0 (12) : On a roll and their next six opponents (Texans, Redskins, Saints, Titans, Bucs, 49ers) have combined for five wins.\n10. Bills 2-1 (13) : Karlos Williams has provided some real punch, and LeSean McCoy is unlikely to play against the Giants this week.\n11. Cowboys 2-1 (3) : Brandon Weeden struggled getting the ball downfield in his first start, and Matt Cassel quickly is learning the offense.\n12. Jets 2-1 (10) : Time to tap the brakes on the New York tabloids pumping up this team as a big-time contender.\n13. Vikings 2-1 (20) : Adrian Peterson looked like his old self once again, which bodes well. Pass rush was in high gear against Philip Rivers.\n14. Chiefs 1-2 (14) : Stay positive. Jeremy Maclin became Kansas City's first wide receiver with a touchdown reception after an 18-game drought.\n15. Chargers 1-2 (11) : GM Tom Telesco spent the offseason retooling the offensive line, which is coming undone quickly.\n16. Colts 1-2 (17) : At 1-2, they're in the driver's seat in the AFC South, where all four teams have the same lousy record.\n17. Dolphins 1-2 (16) : Joe Philbin said it's not time to panic. In the meantime, he'd better worry.\n18. Raiders 2-1 (24) : Mike Tice has former Bears offensive tackle J'Marcus Webb starting at right guard. And QB Derek Carr has been sacked just once.\n19. Rams 1-2 (18) : Knocked Ben Roethlisberger out but mustered only six points against suspect Steelers defense.\n20. Eagles 1-2 (23) : Victory over the Jets didn't subdue the controversy as top-dog free agent DeMarco Murray remains under fire and Ryan Mathews has played well.\n21. Giants 1-2 (25) : Return of wide receiver Victor Cruz could give Big Blue a lift.\n22. Ravens 0-3 (15) : Desperation will set in if they can't win Thursday at Heinz Field and this was a team with Super Bowl aspirations.\n23. Texans 1-2 (27) : Best sign for offense is Ryan Mallett and DeAndre Hopkins look like they have some chemistry.\n24. 49ers 1-2 (19) : Even the most ardent Colin Kaepernick supporters are beginning to admit doubt.\n25. Titans 1-2 (29) : With eight TD passes, Marcus Mariota has tied Mark Rypien (1988) for most in first three games of career.\n26. Lions 0-3 (22) : Criticism of offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi is mounting. QB Matthew Stafford is struggling big time.\n27. Jaguars 1-2 (26) : If they want to create a little buzz, beating the Colts this week would accomplish that.\n28. Redskins 1-2 (21) : That feel good in D.C. didn't even last a week as they were blasted Thursday by the Giants.\n29. Browns 1-2 (28) : Offense is getting very little from free-agent wide receiver Dwayne Bowe.\n30. Buccaneers 1-2 (30) : Lovie Smith supporting kicker Kyle Brindza after he missed three field-goal tries (one from 57 yards) and an extra point. Brindza better not miss this week.\n31. Saints 0-3 (31) : Luke McCown was steady in substitute role, but running game got bottled up by short-handed Panthers.\n32. Bears 0-3 (32) : If they can't topple the Silver and Black, they'll be heavy underdogs until Jay Cutler returns, and who knows when that will be.\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BradBiggs\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears New York Giants Indianapolis Colts NFL New York Jets Kansas City Chiefs Washington Redskins", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ad514/turbine/ct-biggs-nfl-rankings-spt-0930-20150929"], "published": "2015-09-30T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:11:30.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
