Clearly, he’d prefer to have a football in them. “I’m just doing what I’m told and just trying to be accountable,” the Patriots’ running back said. “That’s the biggest thing. Just trying to make sure you know your assignments and trying to get better. I’ve still got a lot of work to do, so I’m going to keep working hard.” The short man (5-foot-8) who was a long shot when training camp began hasn’t been lacking for work since signing with the Patriots as a free agent and beating the odds to earn himself a spot on the team’s 53-man roster. Three games into the regular season, Lewis has accounted for 325 all-purpose yards on 45 touches (30 carries for 146 yards and two touchdowns; 15 catches for 179 yards), playing a big role in his team’s 3-0 start. “I just came here and did what I was asked to do and tried to make the most of my opportunities,” said Lewis. “Whatever the coaches ask me to do I do it as best I can. That’s all you can do. And when you do that, you have a chance.” None of this is to say that Lewis’ performance has been flawless; he fumbled in each of the team’s first two games, one resulting in a turnover, a wrong he’s been attempting to right. “You’ve just got to keep working, working at it every day,” said Lewis, “and do the best (you) can to fix it.” Lewis managed to play fumble-free football in his most recent outing, touching the ball 13 times and producing 67 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown (eight carries for 37 yards and one TD; five catches for another 30 yards) in the Patriots’ 51-17 romp over Jacksonville last Sunday Named the 2008 New Jersey Prep Offensive Player of the Year after rushing 88 times for 1,243 yards and 23 touchdowns as a senior at Blair Academy, Lewis made an immediate impact at the University of Pittsburgh by rushing for 1,799 yards to break Tony Dorsett’s freshman record (1,686 in 1973). Lewis spent just two seasons at Pitt, but that was enough time for him to become the school’s fourth all-time leading rusher with 2,860 yards. A fifth-round pick of Philadelphia in the 2011 NFL Draft, Lewis appeared in 24 games over two seasons with the Eagles, carrying the ball 36 times for 171 yards (a 4.8-yard average) and two touchdowns, catching three passes for 21 yards and returning 32 kicks for 702 yards (a 21.9-yard average) in that time. Page 2 of 2 - Dealt to Cleveland (in exchange for linebacker Emmanuel Acho) on April 11, 2013, Lewis went to training camp with the Browns twice, but never suited up for a regular-season game. Lewis spent the 2013 season on the injured reserve list with a broken leg; he was released by the team in August of 2014. Signed by Indianapolis in September of last year, Lewis spent one week on the team’s active roster, was one of its inactives for its 30-27 loss to the Eagles and was subsequently released by the Colts Now, after essentially spending back-to-back regular seasons out of football, the little guy has returned to the game in a big way. Lewis made an immediate impression in New England with his his abilities to run with and catch the ball and willingness to use his 195 pounds to block. With LeGarrette Blount serving a one-game suspension for violating the league’s substance abuse policy, Lewis played the lead back role (15 carries for 69 yards, four receptions for 51) in the Patriots’ 28-21 season-opening win over Pittsburgh. Even with Blount back, he again got the bulk of the work in the Patriots’ 40-32 win over Buffalo in Week Two. Last Sunday’s rout of the Jaguars may have been a more accurate preview of coming attractions, however, Blount getting 19 touches and Lewis 13 in the game, the combination providing a mixture of power and a quick burst with shiftiness out of the Patriots’ backfield. “He’s a great guy. He’s a great player,” Lewis said of his running mate. “He helped me a lot learning the offense, as well as the other running backs (have). We definitely have a tight group in the running back room and we’re just trying to do great things.” Follow Glen Farley on Twitter at @GFarley_ent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:24:04.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
