Patwalia pleaded for hearing on Friday, but the bench said there was no urgency and posted it for hearing on October 26.\nThe CBI said, \"Such (earlier) recusal and its reasons have also been widely reported in the press. It may be pertinent to note that the CBI brought to the notice of Justice Rajiv Sharma that he had recused himself in another matter relating to the CBI and Virbhadra Singh on an earlier occasion. However, the same was not taken into consideration.\n\"In another case, 'Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association vs state of Himachal Pradesh', where Virbhadra Singh is a party, Justice Sharma had declined to hear the matter and directed the matter to be listed before another bench. However, in the present case, the judge has chosen not to take such recourse despite specific objection being raised to the hearing of the matter by the judge. The judge has not recorded the objection and neither overruled it by way of a reasoned order.\"\nOn merits of the case, the CBI said the HC order had resulted in stalling of the investigation into a disproportionate assets case against Singh and his wife during the period 2009 to 2012 when Singh was Union minister for steel and micro, small and medium enterprises.\n\"The HC order has rendered the investigation meaningless. In case the CBI is not empowered to call accused for questioning nor use the power to arrest if deemed necessary nor prepare and file chargesheet without first showing all the material to the high court and the accused, it will result in travesty of justice as it would mean giving preferential treatment in a case involving breach of public trust and corruption at the highest level of government, which will scuttle the investigation,\" the agency said.\nSingh has maintained that the corruption case slapped against him by the CBI was a result of political vendetta and that it was meant to dislodge him as chief minister in a Congress-ruled state to cause political instability.
