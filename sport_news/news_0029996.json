They were a perfect team, making their blemishes easy to overlook. \nThey were again afforded such a courtesy after a 26-23 overtime victory over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. \nBefore trying to talk through how this happened, let's start with an observation. The Broncos somehow, someway remain 6-0. It's the seventh time they've accomplished this feat. Five of the previous times they advanced to the Super Bowl. \nBrandon McManus finally missed a field goal this season, but not the finisher. He finished off the Browns with a 34-yard field goal. \nThe Broncos possess a championship defense, but an offense that continues to create questions. \nPeyton Manning continues to make mistakes that compromise the defense. None has bad as his toss into linebacker Barkevious Mingo's hands on Denver's first possession in overtime. Mingo feigned a blitz and dropped back, easily snaring a pass intended for Demaryius Thomas, who made overtime necessary with a critical fourth quarter drop. \nWATCH: Aqib Talib's pick-six on Browns QB Josh McCown Advertisement \nCleveland took over at its own 40-yard line needing a field goal to win. The Browns lost 18 yards. The Broncos produced back-to-back sacks, including a crush smash by Malik Jackson. \nJosh McCown marched Cleveland from the 40-yard line in the fourth quarter to tie the score, aided by a foolish roughing the passer penalty on Derek Wolfe. Denver stiffened as the Browns grew conservative once they reached the 11-yard line. On third down, safety T.J. Ward blitz, causing McCown to scramble and throw incomplete, leading to Travis Coon's field goal, making it 23-23. \nThe Broncos had one last chance to win in regulation. \nINJURY: Broncos LB Shane Ray carted off with knee injury \nOn third and 10 from the 43-yard line, Manning lofted a pass down the left sideline, and Emmanuel Sanders dived and appeared to secure a one-handed grab. He stumbled to his feet and jogged into the end zone with an injured left shoulder as time expired. After review, it was ruled an incompletion. Sanders played briefly in overtime, but left again, creating concern about his injury. Aqib Talib (21) of the Denver Broncos makes a pick-six as Travis Benjamin (11) of the Cleveland Browns trails during the first half of action at FirstEnergy Stadium.
