After taking a substance banned by the NCAA, Florida quarterback Will Grier has been suspended for one year. (Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP) Edgar Thompson Of The Orlando Sentinel (TNS) \nFlorida quarterback Will Grier has been suspended for one year for using a substance banned by the NCAA as his team prepares for a high-stakes visit to unbeaten LSU, the signal caller and his head coach announced Monday. \n\"I took an over-the-counter supplement that had something in it,\" Grier told reporters, fighting back tears. \"I did not check with the medical staff. \n\". . . I'm really sorry to everyone. Really, really sorry.\" \nThe Orlando Sentinel confirmed the news shortly before the press conference. \nGrier, a redshirt freshman, tested positive for ligandrol, a supplement used to build lean muscle mass, a source told the Sentinel. Listed at 6-foot-2, 201 pounds, Grier said in August he was up to 215 - a gain of 14 pounds since spring and 24 since the start of 2014. \nGrier started the past five games - all wins for the Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC) - and assumed full-time duties four weeks ago at Kentucky. Grier rotated the first two games with sophomore Treon Harris, who now will step into the starting role against the No. 6 Tigers (5-0, 3-0). \nWith Grier at the helm, the Gators' passing game has shown signs of life for the first time in years. \nGrier leads in the SEC with a completion percentage of 65.8 and is the first Florida quarterback to pass for at 200 yards in three consecutive games since Tim Tebow in 2009. \nGrier threw 554 yards and six touchdowns during wins against Tennessee and Ole Miss, but was less productive at Mizzou, finishing 20-of-33 passing for 208 yards and no touchdowns. \nFlorida enters the LSU game ranked 47th nationally in passing offense after finishing the previous three seasons 106th, 109th and 118th, respectively. \nThe news was first reported by Mike Huguenin of GridironNow.com. \n--- \n2015 The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.) \nVisit The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.) at www.OrlandoSentinel.com \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:55:01.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
