But while they support him, they aren’t allowing themselves to dwell on it. \nThere’s too much to do. \n“Big week this week. There’s really no time to focus on distractions,” tight end Jake McGee said. “[Grier is] a family member; we love him. But a big game [is] coming up and we’re all in toward LSU.” \nFor Florida, the keys to the offense are now back in the hands of sophomore Treon Harris, a player with more experience than the typical backup quarterback. \nHarris entered this season in a tight position battle with Grier, starting the team’s opener against New Mexico State and splitting time in the second game of the season against East Carolina. \nAlthough he eventually lost out to Grier, coach Jim McElwain has made an effort to keep Harris involved with the team, using him in special packages in games and making sure to have him ready to play. \nHarris’ focus hasn’t swayed, either, something that gives his teammates confidence that he can step up to the plate for the remainder of the season. \n“He’s stayed with it and I applaud him for that,” offensive lineman Trip Thurman said of Harris. “Because some guys would just want to take the back seat, but he’s been in the meeting rooms, he’s been with Coach [Doug Nussmeier], meeting with him, working. And even with Grier being the starter, … he’s done well. I’m proud of him.” \nPart of their confidence in Harris also stems from the fact that the sophomore has already played in big games. \nLast season as a freshman, Harris played in the fourth quarter of Florida’s victory over Tennessee and started the final six games of the season, including a win over Georgia and a loss at Florida State. \nWith a matchup at No. 6 LSU on tap this Saturday, Thurman believes that experience has prepared him. \n“Any experience in the SEC is vital,” Thurman said. “And with him having that experience last year and this year, too, [it’s] definitely key for him coming in and [the Gators] probably won’t skip a beat.” \nLinebacker Jarrad Davis doesn’t see the quarterback position differently than any other position when it comes to replacements. \nJust like injuries suffered at linebacker and other spots this season, someone still must do the job. \n“Man down, next man up,” Davis said. “It’s one of those kind of things. We’ve been doing it all year. It’s no different here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:09:01.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
