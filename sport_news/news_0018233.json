The Daily Telegraph can though reveal Thurston will have to be patient. \nHe still has two years to run on his current Cowboys contract with judges remaining firm on a rule that prevents any player becoming an Immortal until at least five years after retirement. It means Thurston has a seven-year wait, at least. \nAround 15 former players will be considered next season — Lockyer, Meninga, Ron Coote, Mick Cronin, Laurie Daley, Brad Fittler, Ken Irvine, Brett Kenny, Allan Langer, Glenn Lazarus, Steve Mortimer, Norm Provan, Steve Rogers, Peter Sterling and Shane Webcke.
