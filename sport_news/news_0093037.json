The Thorns have completed at least one other trade and are close to signing two international players, the source told The Oregonian/OregonLive.\nSports Illustrated's Grant Wahl first reported the news Wednesday . According to Wahl, the Thorns are sending Morgan and Canadian Women's National Team midfielder Kaylyn Kyle to Orlando in exchange for Orlando's first pick in the NWSL college draft, two international roster spots, U.S. national team fullback Meghan Klingenberg (who Orlando is expected to take in the expansion draft) and the first spot in the allocation order, which could possibly allow Portland to acquire Lindsay Horan, if she decides to join the NWSL from Paris Saint-Germain.\nThe 26-year-old Morgan reportedly requested the trade because she wants to live in the same city as her husband, Servando Carrasco, who plays for MLS side Orlando City SC.\nMorgan is one of the most recognizable and marketable women's soccer players in the world. The world-renowned striker has been the face of the U.S. Women's National Team since ascending to international stardom following the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. The striker was part of this summer's U.S. team that won the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n-- Jamie Goldberg | jgoldberg@oregonian.com\n503-853-3761 | @ jamiebgoldberg", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/10/21/alex-morgan-uswnt-star-nwsl-trade-portland-thorns-orlando", "https://twitter.com/Jamiebgoldberg"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:16:25.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
