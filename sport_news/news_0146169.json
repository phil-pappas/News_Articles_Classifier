If people want to focus on his won-loss record, his won-loss record doesn’t tell the story of the season. He ended up among the top guys in the National League in quality starts, pitched 200 innings, 200 strikeouts, (183) hits, (47) walks – a very good season that unfortunately he pitched in bad luck in several games.”\nLester is known for performing at his best in big games, and he would like nothing more than to pitch in the post-season. Lester has a 6-4 record in the post-season, but he has a 3-0 record and 0.43 ERA in three World Series starts.\n“He has a lot bigger goals in mind,” Hoyer said of Lester, who would pitch the first game of the National League Division Series at St. Louis if the Cubs win the NL wild-card game against Pittsburgh on Oct. 7. “That’s really important, having a guy with that perspective on the roster. This isn’t about making the playoffs. It’s about hoisting a trophy, and that’s what he’s all about because he’s done that before.”\nHoyer believed Lester was under a lot of pressure his first season in trying to live up to a big contract while adjusting to a new city, adding he pushed too hard in spring training that led to dead arm fatigue in mid-March.\n“There’s a lot of pressure,” Hoyer said. “He handled it exceptionally well. A big part of why we were attracted to him is we knew he wouldn’t shy away from the responsibility of that kind of contract.\n“To have a guy like that who has won is very valuable.”\nLester had 21 quality starts (pitching at least six innings and allowing three earned runs or fewer). He was 7-4 with a 3.04 ERA in the second half after posting a 4-8 record and 3.58 ERA in the first half that included a combined 0-5 mark in April and June.\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Jon Lester Jed Hoyer Chicago Cubs National League Spring Training", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dc56d/turbine/ct-jon-lester-had-good-season-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:01:21.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
