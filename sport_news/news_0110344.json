Edwards, who leads the team with 54 tackles, and Chris Orr, who is third with 42, have made impacts in their debut seasons as starters for the Badgers (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten). \nEdwards was named the Big Ten Freshman of the Week after registering a career-high 16 tackles and forcing a fumble in last Saturday's 24-7 homecoming victory over Purdue. \n\"I continually enjoy to see our defense grow and kind of rise up to the different challenges and situations that they're in,\" Chryst said Monday at Camp Randall Stadium. \"I thought both Chris and T.J., were both playing confident and trusting their eyes.\" \nWisconsin's defense ranks third nationally, allowing just 10.9 points per game. Since surrendering 35 points in the season-opening loss to Alabama, the Badgers have allowed an average of 6.8 points over their last six games. \n\"Part of the plan by our opponent was not let (outside linebackers) Vince (Biegel) and Joe (Schobert) beat them,\" Chryst said of Purdue. \"It was a pretty good illustration of collectively how teams are going to choose to attack us.\" \nIt has been a problem for opponents since defensive coordinator Dave Aranda arrived three years ago. In that span, the Badgers have given up an average of 17 points per game; only Alabama (16.4 ppg) has been better. \n\"It was fun to see (Edwards and Orr) trust themselves and trigger and yet it was a culmination of good team defense,\" Chryst said. \nSenior safety Michael Caputo said the Badgers' defense, though, still has room for improvement heading into Saturday's game at Illinois (4-2, 1-1). \n\"Definitely filling in the gaps on the run,\" Caputo said. \"We just need to be able to fill those, get over blocks, get through blocks. So stopping the run is one thing we can improve on.\" \nThe Badgers are fourth in the Big Ten in run defense, allowing 103 yards per game. \nNOTES: Chryst expects C Dan Voltz (left arm), who did not play against Purdue, to play against Illinois. Reserve CB Derrick Tindal (bruised knee) is also expected to be ready. ... Chryst remained uncertain about the status of RBs Corey Clement (sports hernia) and Taiwan Deal (ankle). Clement was in uniform on Saturday for the first time since playing in the opener against Alabama but didn't play. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:51:32.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
