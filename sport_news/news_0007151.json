In return for Glenn, the Roughriders received from the Montreal Alouettes a fifth-round choice in the 2016 CFL draft. That pick was promptly sent to the Calgary Stampeders — along with Messam, who is the league’s second-leading rusher — for 23-year-old place-kicking prospect Tyler Crapigna along with a third-round selection in 2016 and the always-popular unidentified negotiation-list player. \nHowever, the actions were more impactful than the anticipated return on the trades, considering the obvious need for the 2-13 Roughriders to embark on an ambitious rebuilding initiative. \nO’Day wasted little time in charting a new course. With three meaningless games remaining in a season gone awry, he dominated deadline day, looking and sounding very much like a man with a plan and a purpose. \nNot even a week ago, the blueprint called for the Green and White to exhaust every minute possibility of making the playoffs. The coup de grace was applied, mercifully enough, by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on Friday when they doubled the visiting Roughriders, 30-15. \nThat inevitable result guaranteed that Saskatchewan would miss the post-season for the first time since 2011 — when the team stuck with veterans after all hope had vanished. \nOn Wednesday, by contrast, O’Day set the wheels in motion for a much-needed reconstruction project — dealing away two fine players who were among the team’s few good-news stories in 2015. \nBrought back to Saskatchewan just in case Darian Durant were to sustain another injury, Glenn piled up the passing yards after the Riders’ marquee player suffered a ruptured left Achilles tendon midway through the regular-season opener. \nWhen the Roughriders did have a sniff of making the playoffs, the classy Glenn gave them that chance, only to have the Green and White’s matador defence bring the house down. \nUnlike last year, the Riders’ offence was actually entertaining to watch after Durant was shelved for the season. Even after Glenn was injured in Week 5 — suffering a torn pectoral muscle and missing six games — Brett Smith demonstrated his athleticism and exhibited considerable potential, fostering speculation that he could be the heir apparent to Durant. \nNow that Glenn is an ex-Roughrider, the 23-year-old Smith is expected to start the three regular-season games that remain before the appropriately nicknamed Garbage Bag Day. \nSome fans had expressed the hope that Glenn would return in 2016, but that possibility was eliminated Wednesday when the Alouettes extended his contract through 2016. Even so, O’Day made the right move by getting what he could for Glenn — and Messam, for that matter. \nYou don’t rebuild with a quarterback who will be 37 next season or a running back who is past 30. \nThe receipt of a fifth-rounder in return for Glenn is hardly a cause for elation, but what else could one rationally expect at this stage? \nThe same mindset should apply to the Messam-to-Calgary deal. \nWith Messam poised to become a free agent, and with contending teams generally set at tailback, there was not a vibrant market for the bruising running back. \nYet, a third-round pick will come in handy for a Saskatchewan team that needs to replenish its Canadian core. And the Riders can use a young kicker, being that Paul McCallum is 45 — nearly twice Crapigna’s age. \nAssessing Wednesday’s moves, it does seem as though a succession plan is in place — with one glaring exception. \nWhat about the GM? \nO’Day has launched a plan for 2016 and beyond with his own future unresolved. It does seem rather contradictory, and borderline dysfunctional. \nAs it stands, the Roughriders are transmitting mixed signals at a critical time when everyone should be philosophically aligned. \nThe interim label was applied to O’Day after the Roughriders’ housecleaning of Aug. 31. Since that time, he has made some longer-term decisions without knowing how long he will occupy the GM’s chair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:07:46.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
