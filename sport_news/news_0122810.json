They picked up their first point in Friday’s 2-1 shootout loss to San Jose. \n\"This will be a real good game for us just to kind of get that first win and maybe raise the emotion level a bit,\" goaltender Cory Schneider said. \n\"Sometimes, you need those turning point games and a rival brings out the best in you. I think we have enough guys here who have played in this rivalry long enough to know what it means. Any time you can beat them it’s a plus, but also to get a win on their ice, first win of the year, it would be really important for us.\" \nThe Devils went 0-3-1 against the Rangers last season, failing to win at least one game against them for the first time since 1993-94 and just the second time in team history. But, it was only two seasons ago the Devils got their first win against the Rangers — a 4-0 triumph at Prudential Center — after getting off to an 0-4-3 start. \n\"We’re looking for the first win for us and it’s one of those things, like Cory said, that when you get a rivalry game early in the season, it can be a turning point where it will bring out your best game and their best game,\" said right wing Kyle Palmieri, who will be playing in his first Devils-Rangers regular-season game after being acquired from Anaheim on June 27. \"You know each team wants to go out there and set the tone for the series for the whole season. But, for us, we want to go out there and build off of what we did [Friday night] and keep improving.\" \nBRIEFS: C Travis Zajac practiced and is hopeful to play today after missing Friday’s game with a lower-body injury. … RW Tuomo Ruutu sat out practice due to what Hynes called \"maintenance.\" \nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:15:21.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
