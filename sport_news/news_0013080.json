The football development expert has been roped in following a recommendation from Jim Selby, the OFA's technical director. \nSelby said, “Houchen would be focusing on developing talent in Oman's mainstream clubs, schools and various community clubs, with the aim of promoting the sport among 6-12 year olds.” \nHouchen said, “I have been told about the great passion that Oman has for football. I am really looking forward to continuing the development of the sport.” \nSelby said, “There are a number of new initiatives planned and Jamie will be on hand to ensure that we start in the right manner.” Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:24:55.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
