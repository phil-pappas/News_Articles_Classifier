But it hasn't happened so far in the playoffs. \nMurphy homered in his record-tying fifth straight postseason game, Jacob deGrom pitched seven strong innings, and the Mets beat the Chicago Cubs 5-2 on Tuesday for a 3-0 lead in the N.L. Championship Series. \nWith a win Wednesday at Wrigley Field, the Mets will be going to their first World Series in 15 years. \nRookie Steven Matz gets the start against the Cubs' Jason Hammel. \n\"Being up 3-0, we're very, very fortunate, because the Cubs have played great,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"We've got to come out tomorrow, and Steven Matz has got to give us a game.\" \nAfter going 0-7 against the Cubs during the regular season, New York is overpowering them with their arms and bats. \nYoenis Cespedes and David Wright each had three hits for the Mets. Cespedes scored the go-ahead run on a two-out wild pitch by Trevor Cahill on a strikeout of Michael Conforto in the sixth inning. \nMurphy tied the mark set by Houston's Carlos Beltran in 2004 with his drive off Kyle Hendricks in the third. \nDeGrom followed up dominant starts by Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard in New York with one of his own. He held the Cubs to two runs and four hits. He struck out seven, walked one and retired his final 11 batters. \nThe righty improved to 3-0 in his first postseason, with all of the wins coming on the road. Jeurys Familia closed for his fifth save of the postseason.

Jorge Soler added a solo drive in the fourth. But manager Joe Maddon's Cubs have just five runs in this series. \nBarring an epic comeback, a World Series championship drought that dates to 1908 will continue. Royals 14, Blue Jays 2: Ben Zobrist and Kansas City showed they can play home run derby, too. And with one more win, the relentless Royals will have a chance to show off their power in a return trip to the World Series. Zobrist hit a two-run homer on knuckleballer R.A. Dickey's fourth pitch of the game, Alex Rios connected an inning later, and the Royals romped to a victory in Toronto for a 3-1 lead in the A.L. Championship Series. \n\"We're a good offensive team, Eric Hosmer said. \"Our park, our style of play is a little different. We like to use our legs and be athletic, but when we come to some of these parks where the fences aren't as deep we've got some guys that can put the ball in the seats.\" \nAlcides Escobar had four RBIs, and Cain drove in three runs as the Royals bounced back from an 11-8 loss Monday. Kansas City led 5-2 in the seventh before breaking away. \nBlue Jays infielder Cliff Pennington relieved in the ninth inning, becoming the first primarily position player to pitch in the postseason. Greeted by cheers, he allowed two hits and got one out. \nKansas City can win the pennant Wednesday, when Edinson Volquez starts against Toronto's Marco Estrada in a Game 1 rematch. \n\"It's a do-or-die game for us,\" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. \"I think these guys will let this one go, and they'll show up to play. ... I know these guys will be ready.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:02:39.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
