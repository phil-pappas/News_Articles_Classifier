The 5'7” shooting guard has averaged about 20 points per game while shooting 47.4 percent from the floor and hitting over 90 percent of her free throws in high school. York has put up over 1,000 points for Crocker in her career. “Kelsi has been an integral part of this program for many years,” Crocker coach Nancy Ward said. “She has made such an impact and it has nothing to do with how many points she scores. She is a leader and an inspiration to her teammates.” York said the coaches from Lincoln had been hot on her trail all year. “They've been talking to me a lot all summer,” York said. “They came to watch me play a lot. They've been really good about contacting me and making me feel wanted. I went up there for an official visit up there and everything felt right. The campus was awesome, I love the coaches, I met all the girls up there and I just couldn't find anything wrong with it. It just felt right. Everyone always said, 'You'll know when you find the right college, you'll get that feeling.' I definitely felt it when I went up there.” Ward said Lincoln coach Nicole Collier has found not only a prolific scorer, but a relentless one as well. “Every time she steps on the floor she is going to give it everything she has,” Ward said. York said she has Ward to thank for that. Ward spends a part of her practice in a unique way, sitting the team down following all the conditioning and game planning with a story-telling session. “We sit down in a circle and she reads a story,” York said. “And she always pulls something out of it. Not only something you can use on the basketball court, but something you can use in life too. “One of the main things she's taught me in that, that I firmly believe in, is the work you put in you're definitely going to get how much you put in out of it.” So, York makes sure she puts in plenty of time perfecting her game. York also plays softball, but it's no secret which game has her heart. On Sept. 24, smack dab in the middle of her softball season (and less than a week before her team was crowned Frisco League Conference champions), she tweeted “basketball season, where you at?” “It's addicting to me,” York said of her relationship with basketball. “No matter how many points I score and how well my team does every night, you can always improve your game whether it be defensively or if you had an off night with your shot. There's always something you can do to get better. And I'm that type of player that's always had that drive to get better.” Page 2 of 2 - While advancing in her basketball career realizes a dream, it also splits up a tandem that has been together for over a decade. Moving to Lincoln will, inadvertently, pit her against Crocker teammate Lindsay Medlen who has made her verbal commitment to Lindenwood. “It's going to be weird,” York said. “We've been on each other's teams since kindergarten basketball. Lindsay and I have this connection on the court, they call it our telepathy. I love playing with her, she's a great player and I'm going to miss being on her team.” And the Crocker basketball program, especially its coach, will miss them both. “I know it is about time for these seniors to move on to the next phase in their life's journey, but it is hard to see them go,” Ward said. “They have all matured into strong, caring and driven young ladies and are ready for that next step.” By Derek Dueker   Derek Dueker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:30:59.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
