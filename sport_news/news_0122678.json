But the most important developments that could determine Saturday's winner don't necessarily involve X's and O's.\nOle Miss is coming off a sobering 37-24 loss at Memphis. The Rebels have lost two of four games since an upset win over Alabama in late September.\nGet sports news and updates right in your inbox Sign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.\n\"We are going to see Saturday night if the heart is there,\" Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze said. \"I'm sure we will do what we have done every week and prepare them to have that. It is an individual decision. I am going to do everything within my power that I can to make sure that occurs.\"\nTexas A&M fell flat in a 41-23 loss to Alabama last weekend. The Aggies were plagued by mistakes — quarterback Kyle Allen threw three interceptions that were all returned for TDs.\nTexas A&M can take solace in the fact that it has played well in Oxford in the recent past. The Aggies beat the Rebels 30-27 in 2012 and 41-38 in 2013, but those thrillers came when Johnny Manziel, now in the NFL, was throwing the ball all over the field.", "external_links": ["http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:13:23.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
