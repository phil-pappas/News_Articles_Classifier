Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: What's the position matchup we should worry about against the Giants? Used to be NY's DL but not too worried about them anymore?\nBabe Laufenberg: You are right - the Giants have always had the ability to really get after the QB, starting with LT on up through Strahan, Justin Tuck and JPP. But they don't have that guy on this team. They are next to last in sacks/play. So Cassel should be afforded plenty of time. The Giants played 2 deep safeties virtually every snap in the first game with the Cowboys, but they had two safeties making their first NFL start and the Cowboys had Dez Bryant. We will see how they play it this week.\nQuestion: Do you think inserting Christine Michael into the lineup will make a difference at all? Is Randle holding the offense back or are the running game struggles a matter of circumstances?\nBabe Laufenberg: Certainly haven't seen enough of Michael to make an educated guess, but I think the Cowboys are searching for anything to try to get the running game going. Still chuckle that there was so much talk about anyone being able to run behind that line when DeMarco Murray left. The mantra went from, \"Anyone can run behind that line,\" to, \"No one can run behind that line,\" pretty quickly.\nQuestion: Now that the Cowboys have essentially benched Brandon Weeden, has he played his last game in Dallas? Or do you think the Cowboys would actually bring him back next season?\nBabe Laufenberg: No way I see Weeden being here next season. And my guess he wouldn't want to be.\nQuestion: Is there a scenario where the Cowboys decide to shut Tony Romo down for the season?\nBabe Laufenberg: Short of something crazy happening and the bone not healing properly, no.\nQuestion: Is the NFL now a check-down league? It seems even the best QBs are still throwing mostly short passes and completion percentages have never been higher. Nowadays, pretty much every QB has a positive TD to interception ratio.\nBabe Laufenberg: No question the league has changed. Quarterbacks don't get beat up like they once did on a weekly basis with the rule changes. Guys struggled raising their arms above their head by the fourth quarter. Ball gets out quicker today on shorter passes. Can't even begin to make statistical comparisons of the former QBs with today's generation of QBs. Terry Bradshaw completed 51.9% of his passes, with 212 TDs and 210 interceptions. Hall Of Fame. Those numbers would get you benched today. But again, totally different game played under a totally different set of rules. Hey, \"The Greatest QB of All-Time,\" Joe Namath, (OK, at least the one who had the most fun) completed 50% of his passes with 173 TDs and 220 interceptions. You just watched Tom Brady. Was the ball being rifled down the field every play? Hardly. Again, different game today. You have to leave the statistical comparisons to baseball.\nQuestion: Is there a 100% chance Tony Romo comes back and plays even if the Cowboys are 2-7 or 2-8? Or could the organization take the same approach as 2010 and let Romo heal up and get ready for the 2016 season?\nBabe Laufenberg: There was an ornery old coach around here who was fond of saying, \"Football players play football in football season.\" I don't know what your calendar says, but mine says October 21. That means football. So he plays.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nSherrington: Kool-Aid drinker Jerry Jones hasn't learned important football lesson\nBob Sturm: Examining the 2016 NFL draft from the Cowboys' perspective\nSabin: Dez not being counted out, but several factors make return vs. NYG unlikely for Cowboys star WR\nLaufenberg: Is Michael the answer?
