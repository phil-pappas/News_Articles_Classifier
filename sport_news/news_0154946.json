Quite the opposite, actually. \nDespite averaging only three yards per carry and spending the conclusion of the last two games watching Giovani Bernard take the snaps at running back he’s not letting personal struggles get in the way. \n“At this point I’m being a team guy,” Hill said. “I want the team to be successful and continue to win football games. At the end of the day if my numbers aren’t great or not astonishing or not helping people’s fantasy teams then, oh well, we are trying to win football games here. That’s all that matters at the end of the day.” \nHe speaks the truth. Inevitably, however, a consistent running attack from Hill will be necessary to keep winning. Thus far, it hasn’t happened. Hill fumbled twice against San Diego, ending his day early. Last week he only managed 21 yards on 12 carries. Meanwhile, Giovani Bernard entered and racked up 49 yards on 13 rushes. Bengals' Film Session: Correcting a multitude of issues \nBernard ranks second among NFL running backs in yards per carry at 5.7. Both Hill and Bernard have exactly 41 carries on the year. Bernard rushed for 235 yards on those and Hill 123. \nBernard also has 12 receptions for 75 yards while Hill caught a single pass for two yards. Not hard to see why Bernard has been the last man standing at the conclusion of games. \nLast year, Hill rushed 222 times for 1,124 yards. That was 5.1 yards per rush. \nTheories to why Hill hasn’t transferred 2014 to 2015 stretch from tentative running to worrying too much about fumbling to not lining up behind Ryan Hewitt enough in the I-formation. \nHe hears the support of his teammates noting he’s close to enjoying the one game to return the season to its desired track, but plans to keep plugging away with the same method for the breakthrough. \n“I’m just going to keep doing what I’m doing,” Hill said. “Keep pounding. Keep doing what got me here. Listen to the coaches, stick to the game plan, make sure I am assignment sound and keep working.” Bengals must terrorize Chiefs on third downs \nINJURY REPORT: Only one player wasn’t a full participant in Thursday’s practice for the Bengals. Safety George Iloka (ankle) missed practice for the second straight day. \nAdam Jones (elbow) returned after sitting out Wednesday. That’s particularly good news considering questions were abound whether Jones will be able to go Sunday against the Chiefs. He’s now trending in the correct direction. \nElsewhere, defensive tackle Marcus Hardison (knee), corner Dre Kirkpatrick (shoulder), defensive tackle Pat Sims (hip) and offensive tackle Andre Smith (hip) all were full participants as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:39:00.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
