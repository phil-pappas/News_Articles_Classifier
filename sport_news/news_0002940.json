At just 1,250 square feet, it's a dwarf compared to the tens of thousands of square feet provided by WeWork or Cambridge Innovation Center, but that's not quite the point for this 297 Newbury St. space. In fact, it's more of a beginning. \nThat's because Cove is meant to be not just an affordable, flexible solution for people who need workspace, but a solution that finds its power in numbers. Cove has one space in Boston right now, but it plans to open another in Somerville's Union Square, said Jeremy Scott, a technology advisor for Cove. If all goes well, it will have several more locations over time, mirroring the network of eight spots Cove runs in D.C., giving its members more flexibility in where they want to work. \"We just want to provide this simple welcoming space for you to come and be productive, yet have the tools you need to do that.\" \n\"Most members use at least two locations because the ones in D.C., they're not that far apart from each other,\" Erin Gifford, Cove's brand director, said. \"So if you're at home and you pop into your neighborhood Cove, get a few things done, you have a meeting downtown and you're done with your meeting, there's probably a Cove you can pop into there as well.\" \nWhen we said Cove offers a flexible solution we really meant it, with monthly membership starting at $59 for 1 1/2 hours a day (the next tiers are $99 for 4 hours a day and $249 for unlimited access). Cove also has membership plans for groups. Members check into the space with Cove's app, which tracks how long they spend at the office and shows them events happening at Cove and other people who are working there. If members with one of the limited time options goes over the limit, they're charged a small fee for every extra half hour. \nWalking through the space, Cove doesn't have all the bells and whistles you might see at larger spaces, but Gifford said that's by design because members down in D.C. indicated they wouldn't like to pay for those extra features. What it does include is a high-speed wireless connection, a color printer/scanner, a rentable conference room and two closet-size rooms to make private calls. And there's no limits to using any of the Boston space's 23 desk seats, two lounge chairs and two sofas. \n\"We keep it pretty simple because it's really just a place for you do get things done, so we're not trying to be the most modern thing that you'd ever seen,\" she said. \"We just want to provide this simple welcoming space for you to come and be productive, yet have the tools you need to do that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:57:34.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
