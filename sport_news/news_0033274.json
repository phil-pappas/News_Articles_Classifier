The marquees serve as a talking point when recruits stroll around and as a reminder of the program's standards.\nIn addition to the numbers, there are photos of a host of stars. While most are players who have earned their place in USC lore, there are four coaches ringing the field: Howard Jones, John McKay, John Robinson and Pete Carroll.\nThe common thread? Each won a national title in Los Angeles and is or will soon be in the College Football Hall of Fame.\nAs athletic director Pat Haden embarks on the second coaching search of his tenure and the third at USC in less than six years, those four title-winners illustrate what the next man to take the job will have to live up to. Whoever it is will also have to appease a fanbase that is desperately yearning to meet expectations.\n© Provided by Bleacher Report Richard Hartog/Associated Press\n\"I've been here for six years. You know Los Angeles, and you know this is USC, and you know the expectations are to win,\" Trojans interim head coach Clay Helton said Tuesday. \"I know exactly what the job entails and what it demands.\"\nHelton, in his second stint as interim head coach, will be given an opportunity to interview for the full-time gig after the season. But like Ed Orgeron two years ago, he will be a long shot to turn the temporary position into a permanent one.\nAt this point, eight days after Steve Sarkisian's contract was terminated, far bigger names than Helton are being mentioned.\nAt the top of the list, for many fans and media members alike, seems to be Philadelphia Eagles head coach Chip Kelly .\nOn the surface, it makes some sense to connect the two dots. USC is one of the premier college jobs in the country, and Kelly had near unprecedented success during his time at Oregon. And despite their win against the New York Giants on Monday night, the Eagles are struggling, so maybe a return to college at a place where success can come fairly easily could be in the cards for Kelly.\n\"Of course, the Eagles coach had so much success in college,\" NFL Media's Ian Rapoport said on NFL Network . \"I am told he would have some interest in the USC job, although a source close to him points out Chip Kelly really likes to be liked and wanted, so that may be driving some of his interest.\"\nRapoport buried the real information here. To put it bluntly, the fact that Kelly likes to be wanted is driving all of the conversation.\nKelly's team is currently in first place in the NFC East, and he is in the middle of a reported five-year, $32.5 million contract . While USC has deep pockets and can afford to make its next coach one of the highest-paid in the country, that kind of contract would represent a near doubling of what the school has paid its past two head coaches.\nTrojans boosters would no doubt pony up in a heartbeat to lure Kelly, but the reclusive New Englander does not appear to be chasing a paycheck and has everything he wants in Philadelphia, including control of the roster. Even more importantly, he works for a fairly hands-off owner in Jeffrey Lurie, who has given Kelly nearly everything he has requested and has proved over the years to have no problem retaining his coach even if the team is not quite meeting expectations.\nThere are few, if any, reasons for Kelly to give up his position for a sometimes headache-inducing one at USC.\n© Provided by Bleacher Report Matt Rourke/Associated Press\nAnd more to the point, while it may be fun to think about the former Oregon coach at USC, there are few indications that Haden would be comfortable hiring Kelly in the first place. The latter received a show-cause order as part of NCAA sanctions leveled against the Ducks for actions during his tenure, and Haden has been notoriously straight and narrow when it comes to compliance at USC.\nFor the Kelly-to-USC rumors to actually have some substance, the two parties would have to have some realistic chance of coming together. At this point, neither appears to be lusting after the other in any shape or form.\nBleacher Report recently spoke to two sources who worked with Kelly in Eugene, and each believed that he would remain in the NFL for the foreseeable future.\n\"I can't see it,\" one source said of Kelly leaving for USC, adding that the reputation the coach earned as being stingy with his time when it came to media obligations and booster functions was accurate.\nKelly donning the cardinal and gold would be a welcome sight for many in the college game as they'd have a chance to see his fast-pace system paired with the athletes the Trojans recruit and already have on their roster.\nBut the Kelly talk is merely indicative of where USC is in the search process. Haden, who had to be tended to after feeling light-headed before the Trojans' loss at Notre Dame on Saturday, has barely gotten started on the task of finding a new coach. With Kelly, Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh and, yes, even Carroll's name already popping up in the media, it's fairly obvious that USC boosters are doing what they can to float potential candidates.\n\"I love USC. It's a great place,\" Carroll told reporters Monday. \"... But that's not happening.\"\n© Provided by Bleacher Report Jae C. Hong/Associated Press\nFurther complicating matters is Haden's role in the hiring process. He has the support of university president Max Nikias and appears to have the authority to make a hire, but many influential alumni around the university have questioned whether he should be entrusted with such a crucial decision given the number of mistakes he's made while stewarding the department.\nWhether Haden makes the hire or not, one thing is clear: The Trojans have to nail down a head coach who will stick around for more than three years.\n\"I think it needs to be someone who creates a family-oriented atmosphere and is consistently even-keeled,\" USC backup quarterback and next year's presumed starter Max Browne told Bleacher Report. \"But that's (Haden's) job, and it's on his plate.\"\nThat is a plate that does not include Kelly but could feature trendy names like Memphis head coach Justin Fuente, Houston's Tom Herman, Utah's Kyle Whittingham and maybe even somebody like Oklahoma's Bob Stoops .\nIt's a critical time at Troy and a precarious position for one of the most storied football programs in the country. Whoever winds up with the job will be reminded every practice what it will take to rise to the level that earns a spot along the wall.\nBryan Fischer is a national college football columnist at Bleacher Report.
