He also led Ahly to finish third in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup.\nAhly board members held a meeting on Wednesday to choose between four names including Marcos Paqueta, Felipe Scolari, Thomas Schaaf, along with Manuel Jose.\n\"The board members refused the return of Manuel Jose,\" Ahly board member Taher El-Sheikh said after the meeting.\n\"We have not yet decided on the coach. We are still in talks to choose the applicable one,\" the board member added.\n\"Ahly's new coach will be a Spanish or Portuguese tactician.\" El-Sheikh concluded.\nThe club's head of youth development Abdel-Aziz Abdel-Shafy, known as Zizo, is taking the reigns temporarily ahead of the much anticipated Egypt Super Cup against Zamalek in mid-October.\nThe name of Ahly's new coach is expected to be unveiled after Monday's meeting.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:06:52.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
