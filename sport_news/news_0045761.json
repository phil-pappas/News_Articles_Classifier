Even after the Redskins drove 90 yards for the winning touchdown late in the fourth quarter last week, the consensus was the Eagles defense had performed well enough, particularly since it was on the field for more than two-thirds of the game. Neither the players nor coordinator Billy Davis have reached for the excuse that was being offered - remembering that people who say Chip Kelly's methods tire them out are systematically exiled - but it is there, nonetheless. \nWhen Davis gathered the defense on Tuesday to open the practice week, he told his players that if the next 12 games come down to that same situation, he thinks the Eagles win all 12. \n\"This group of guys will make those plays,\" Davis said. \"I said after the game, we didn't make them this time . . . but, going forward, we will make those plays.\" \nIf it seems like faint praise for a defensive coordinator to predict success when the other team has only one drive left, needs a touchdown, and is 90 yards away, maybe that's what it is. No kidding, a defense should succeed in that situation. \nBut Davis needs to build up his group because he probably knows that things could still go either way for the unit. It started the season with a lot of new faces, including some former backups holding regular roles, and has continued with injury problems that have placed rookies or additional backups on the field. (Not Marcus Smith, of course. Apparently, there would have to be a natural disaster at midfield to get him out there.) \nSeven members of the defense were on the injury report last week: Byron Maxwell, Cedric Thornton, Chris Maragos, Taylor Hart, Kiko Alonso, Brandon Bair, and Mychal Kendricks. Maxwell, Thornton, Maragos, and Hart are expected to be available against the Saints on Sunday, but to what level they will be effective or able to stay on the field is hard to say. Maxwell lasted just seven snaps against the Redskins before his injured quadriceps forced him back to the sideline. Kendricks went just 11 snaps before leaving because of a hamstring strain. \nThe mix and match Davis has been pulling off has worked acceptably so far. Rookie Jordan Hicks has stepped into the hole left by Alonso and Kendricks and done remarkably well at inside linebacker, although he hasn't been asked to do an awful lot. Rookie Eric Rowe took over the cornerback position for Maxwell and also did fine in man coverage. They made it work with Bennie Logan moving to defensive end and backup Beau Allen taking over at nose tackle and with veteran free-agent signing E.J. Biggers, who has only seven NFL starts since 2012, becoming the nickel cornerback. \nThe question is whether this is a solid foundation or a house of cards that can work against Ryan Fitzpatrick and Kirk Cousins but will be exposed by Drew Brees, noted eater of rookies and backups. \nAs precarious as things are on the offensive side of the ball, at least the Eagles will be operating against the 24th-ranked defense in the NFL. Despite their 1-3 record, the Saints offense is sixth in the league and third in passing yards. And Brees comes before them at a time when the Eagles defense knows it has to play at a very high level just to give the team a chance. \n\"We've been used to [having] an offense that has been so good the last couple years, that if we are a really good defense, it means we're probably dominating as a team,\" safety Malcolm Jenkins said. \"Right now, for us to win, we need this defense to be great, and we're right on the cusp, just one or two plays from doing it.\" \nThat was the mantra from both sides of the ball last week. That the Eagles are close, very close. The scary part, however, is they might be just as close to collapse as to recovery. If it turns out to be collapse, don't be surprised if it takes place where least expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:04:53.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
