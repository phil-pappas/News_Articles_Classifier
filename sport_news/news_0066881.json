(Steve Dykes / Getty Images) Chris Dufresne Contact Reporter \nThere are 20 undefeated teams left in college football, but not for long. \nAt least one is guaranteed to go down Saturday in the matchup of California (5-0) at Utah (4-0). \nSeveral others are likely to add \"1\" to the end of their records. \nWe've divided the \"Terrific 20\" into levels of perfection vulnerability. \nHouston is in the weekend clubhouse at 5-0 after defeating Southern Methodist on Thursday night. \nTexas A&M and Memphis are on \"defeat standby\" as they await huge tests next week against Alabama and Mississippi. \nSafe Zone \n—Baylor (4-0) at Kansas (0-4). \nOh my wipeout goodness. Art Briles, who says this is his best Baylor team, will be able to pick the score and complete a crossword puzzle. The Bears are 44-point favorites and that line might have come out of a conservative think tank. \n—Oklahoma (4-0) vs. Texas (1-4). \nTo be fair, Texas has lost two heartbreak games and the teams it lost to are a combined 19-1. Still, last week's 50-7 loss at Texas Christian was a stark reminder how far the Longhorns are from being contenders. \n—Maryland (2-3) at Ohio State (5-0) \nOhio State has issues. but nothing compared to Maryland, which could fire Randy Edsall any time between the national anthem and the flight home. The Terrapins have been outscored, 73-6, inlosses to Michigan and West Virginia. \n—Michigan State (5-0) at Rutgers (2-2) \nMichigan State has underperformed this year, but Rutgers is a shambles. Any regrets, Commissioner Jim Delany, about inviting Maryland and Rutgers to the Big Ten? \n—South Carolina (2-3) at Louisiana State (4-0) \nAny reasonable hope South Carolina had of winning ended when the game, due to severe flooding in the Gamecocks' home state, was switched to Baton Rouge. \n—Tulane (2-2) at Temple (4-0) \nTemple's defense is legit, while Tulane lost to Georgia Tech and Duke by the combined score of 102-17. \n—Illinois (4-1) at Iowa (5-0) \nIowa is a 10-point favorite at home — that sounds about right. \nToo close to call \n—Georgia Tech (2-3) at Clemson (4-0) \nSurprised? Guess as to why Clemson is only a seven-point home favorite. People still don't trust Clemson and can't believe Georgia Tech is this bad. The Yellow Jackets were picked to win the ACC Coastal. \n—Kent State (2-3) at Toledo (4-0) \nThe oddsmakers say this is a double-digit game, but Kent State has given up 14 or fewer points in three of its last four games. That includes a 10-7 loss at Minnesota. \nVulnerable \n—Cal (5-0) at Utah (4-0) \nCal's great early-season story might get Bear-trapped in Salt Lake City. Or, maybe Utah is the vulnerable team? Pac-12 road teams are 9-2 this year and Utah is 0-3 in homecoming games since joining the Pac-12. \n—Miami (3-1) at Florida State (4-0). \nThree things: Miami has no historical fear of Florida State. Coach Al Golden is desperate for a signature win. Florida State won a 24-16 clunker last week against Wake Forest. \n—Navy (4-0) at Notre Dame (4-1) \nShow of hands: How many of you knew Navy was undefeated? \n—Florida (5-0) at Missouri (4-1) \nFlorida got a 14-position poll jump for beating Mississippi last week. How soon we forget the Gators were lucky to survive Kentucky (14-9) and Tennessee (28-27). \n—Northwestern (5-0) at Michigan (4-1) \nMichigan wins, 3-0? Both schools, incredibly, are coming off shutouts against Big Ten opponents. \n—Texas Christian (5-0) at Kansas State (3-1). \nKansas State's only defeat, last week to Oklahoma State, was aided by a blown Big 12 officials' call. \n—Oklahoma State (5-0) at West Virginia (3-1) \nHome cooking should settle West Virginia, which fumbled twice and had three interceptions in last week's loss at Oklahoma.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:29:20.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
