And before Reggis Ball could react, Marlon Mack was gone.\nThat was last year at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, when the American Athletic Conference rookie of the year raced through the University of Memphis defense for a 75-yard score, one of only that the defense allowed all year. Mack, a freshman at the time, went on to finish with 159 total yards. He also led the Bulls with eight catches in the game.\nWhen the two teams meet again at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa on Friday night, much of the focus will be on Paxton Lynch and the Tigers' offense. But South Florida's best hopes of keeping pace lie with Mack, who is averaging 5.4 yards per carry this season after leading the conference with 1,014 rushing yards as a freshman last year.\nMemphis' defense has been shredded by high-powered passing attacks in each of its past two games, first in a 44-41 win over Bowling Green, then a 53-46 victory over Cincinnati. Mack will present a different kind of challenge. The key to stopping him?\n\"Be in our gaps. Play our ball,\" defensive end Ernest Suttles said. \"We can't worry too much about the opponent, because when we're at our best, we can play with anybody. So it's simply about us doing what we have to do and being in the right place at the right time.\"\nThe Tigers have not struggled with the run so far this season. They've held opponents to 120 yards per game, which ranks 34th in the Football Bowl Subdivision. But they have struggled with big plays, many of them on the ground. And piling on.\n this week that he will get Mack more than the 12 carries he received in a 35-17 loss at Maryland.\n\"No matter how that (Maryland) game goes, he's got to get more than 12 touches. He just has to,\" Taggart told the Tampa Bay Times. \"And that's on me to make sure that he gets more than 12 touches, and he will.\"\nOn the other side of the ball, USF uses a 4-2-5 scheme that emphasizes speed but relies upon its defensive line. The group has posted 18 tackles for a loss and seven sacks in just three games, two against opponents from Power Five conferences.\n\"USF, their strong suit has always been their defensive line. So each year when we play USF, it's always a challenge,\" offensive lineman Micah Simmons said. \"You always know going in to play them, it's going to be a battle. It's going to be a rough day up front. It's going to be nasty. It's going to be physical. But that's what offensive linemen love â€” those are the types of games that you live for.\"\nIt would be easy for Memphis to look past Friday night's game to the following bye week, and an Oct. 17 meeting with No. 3 Ole Miss, which will be among the most ballyhooed games at the Liberty Bowl in the past decade. Instead, the Tigers must be focused to face a team that has had two weeks to prepare for them and, despite its 1-2 record, has plenty of talent on both sides of the ball.\n\"If you had taken the school colors off of Cincinnati's uniforms, our kids could watch the film and know they're going to play against really good players. And that's the same case here,\" Memphis coach Justin Fuente said. \"They've been on the field with Mack and they know he took one to the house versus a pretty good defense last year. They know that they've got very good players.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:33:29.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
