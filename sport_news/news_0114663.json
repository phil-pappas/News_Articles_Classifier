He says Mauer will remain the first baseman going into the 2016 season after Mauer hit a career-worst .265 and struck out a career-high 112 times.\nMauer won three American League batting titles as a catcher. But injuries have contributed to his struggles the last two seasons. He hit .277 in 2014.\nMauer will turn 33 in April and is under contract through 2018.\nRyan stopped short of saying he can become the annual batting title contender he was in his younger days. But he says he believes hitting .300 again is a realistic expectation.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
