(AP) - Sammy Schmitz won the U.S. Mid-Amateur on Thursday to earn a Masters invitation, making a hole-in-one on the 260-yard, par-4 33rd hole at John’s Island Club in a 3-and-2 victory over Marc Dull. \n“I can’t believe it,” said the 35-year-old Schmitz, a reinstated amateur from Farmington, Minnesota. “I’ve been hitting driver (on the hole) the entire tournament. I think I’ve hit the green four times. I just had a good feeling. I can’t believe it went in.” \nIt is believed to be only the second ace on a par 4 in USGA amateur competition. Derek Ernst accomplished the feat on the 299-yard eighth hole at Bandon Trails in the 2011 U.S. Amateur Public Links. \n“I win 14 (the 32nd hole in the 36-hole file) and I’m thinking maybe we can get back in this,” Dull said. “I didn’t hit a good tee shot, and when a guy jars it on a par 4, what are you going to do? You just shake his hand and laugh it off. It was an amazing shot that he hit.” \nSchmitz is a regional director for a health care services company. He played at St. John’s University in Minnesota and is a three-time Minnesota Golf Association Player of the Year. \n“It’s not real yet,” Schmitz said. “It feels real good. It’s been a long week, a long nine days being away from my two little girls at home. I’m pretty happy and proud.” \nThe 29-year-old Dull, from Lakeland, Florida, also is a reinstated amateur. He played at Florida Southern and works as a caddie at Streamsong Resort. \n“This is by far the most golf I’ve ever played in a row,” Dull said. “I wouldn’t say that had anything to do with it. I don’t feel tired. I don’t feel fatigued. I just didn’t have it today. He played well. He made the putts when he had to make them.” \nThe event is limited to players 25 and older. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:03:46.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
