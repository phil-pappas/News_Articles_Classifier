She's such a great champion and has been playing quite well the last month or so, winning Wuhan, so she's in great form,\" Jankovic said.\n\"I'm happy with the way I played, though, and I'm really happy I was able to beat her tonight.\"\n(Writing by Patrick Johnston in Singapore; editing by Toby Davis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:17:20.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
