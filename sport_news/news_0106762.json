A team from the Natural History Museum of Utah discovered fossils of strange-looking turtle in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah.\nJoshua Lively of the University of Texas at Austin called it one of the weirdest turtles that ever lived. He studied the fossils for his master's thesis.\nThe 2-foot-long turtle lived about 76 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period when southern Utah was a wet, hot climate with rivers and bayous.\nResearchers say its pig-like nose with two nostrils makes it unlike any other turtle ever found.\nThe findings were published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.\nCopyright The Associated Press\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:15:22.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
