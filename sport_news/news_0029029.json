(Photo: Doug McSchooler/for The Star) \nHere's a look at all of the Week 9 area high school football predictions. I was 38-5 last week (88.4 percent) to improve to 277-67 (80.5 percent) on the season. All games 7 p.m. Friday unless noted: \nBrownsburg (4-4) vs. Hamilton Southeastern (7-1), at Victory Field: One of the more intriguing games of the final week of the high school football regular season will be played in a baseball stadium. \nBrownsburg will meet Class 6A No. 5 Hamilton Southeastern in the second game of the Victory Field Gridiron Classic (the first game was Cathedral's 35-6 win over Fishers two weeks ago). \nAfter three consecutive losses in the series, HSE has blanked Brownsburg by a combined score of 73-0 the last two season. A third consecutive shutout will be a difficult task. \nBrownsburg has won its last three games by scores of 59-30 (Westfield), 66-41 (Zionsville) and 47-24 (Noblesville). Junior quarterback Hunter Johnson, a Tennessee recruit, has passed for 922 yards with 14 touchdowns and one interception during that span. Senior running back Toks Akinribade (1,202 rushing yards, 15 touchdowns) and senior receiver Tyler Kirtz (61 catches for 989 yards and 15 TDs) are having huge seasons. \nBut this will be Brownsburg's toughest opponent since losing 37-23 to Fishers on Sept. 18. HSE has won seven in a row since a season-opening loss to Carmel. Senior quarterback Carter Poiry (1,585 passing yards, 10 touchdowns) has teamed up often with receivers Greg Miller (39 catches, 561 yards) and Aaron Matio (24 catches, 478 yards) and defensive lineman Collin Miller has 16 tackles for a loss. \nThis will be a good test before tough sectional matchups next week for both teams. HSE will face rival Fishers while Brownsburg takes on Avon. HSE 34, Brownsburg 27. \nCathedral (6-2) at Center Grove (8-0): The top-ranked Trojans get a heck of a test in the regular-season finale against the fourth-ranked Irish. Center Grove won last year's meeting, 44-38. Both teams are better this season. Both teams like to run the ball but it may come down to which senior quarterback – Cathedral's Max Bortenschlager or Center Grove's Joey Siderewicz – can hit more big plays in the passing game. Will this be the first of two meetings? These teams could meet again in the semistate round. Center Grove 35, Cathedral 28. \nCincinnati St. Xavier (5-2) at Warren Central (5-3), 7:30 p.m.: Warren Central lost 23-14 last year at St. Xavier. The Warriors were close earlier this season against another Cincinnati power, losing 27-16 at Colerain. Jay Coe (815 rushing yards, 18 TDs and 31 catches for 383 yards and three TDs) is putting together quite a season. St. Xavier 24, Warren Central 21. \nColumbus North (6-2) at Southport (6-2): If Perry Meridian upsets Bloomington South, the winner of this game can claim a share of the Conference Indiana title. It should be a good one regardless between a pair of Class 6A ranked teams (Southport is No. 8 and Columbus North No. 10). Columbus North has a tough game looming next week in the sectional against Center Grove. Southport junior receiver Blake Evans (68 catches, 907 yards, 15 TDs) is having a big season. Southport 31, Columbus North 28. \nWhiteland (6-2) at Greenwood (5-3): Whiteland leaned on a strong defensive performance and a big night from senior Brandon Patterson (156 yards on 21 carries) last week in a 17-7 win over Plainfield. Whiteland has won three in a row in this series. Whiteland 24, Greenwood 14. \nWestfield (4-4) at Brebeuf Jesuit (5-3): Westfield has lost four in a row for the first time since a 3-7 season in 2012. Brebeuf has Bishop Chatard on deck next week in a Class 3A sectional. Westfield 28, Brebeuf Jesuit 24. \nBowman Academy (2-5) at Guerin Catholic (6-2), 8 p.m.: Guerin is coming off a huge win over Bishop Chatard, its first in program history. Guerin Catholic 42, Bowman Academy 13. A year after quitting, Clinton Prairie starts new era on the fly \nClinton Prairie (5-3) at Sheridan (3-5): Sheridan will honor Bud Wright before the game for his 50th season as the program's coach. Sheridan 35, Clinton Prairie 28. \nDanville (1-7) at Crawfordsville (3-5): Danville stayed in the game last week against Western Boone, losing 28-14. Danville 38, Crawfordsville 21. \nEast Central (7-1) at Roncalli (4-4), 7:30 p.m.: Roncalli should have some confidence and momentum after last week's 30-14 win over Decatur Central. Roncalli 24, East Central 21. \nFranklin (1-7) at Decatur Central (6-2): The Hawks look to bounce back. Decatur Central 49, Franklin 14. \nFranklin Central (2-6) at Terre Haute North (3-5), 7:30 p.m.: Franklin Central looks to make it three in a row. Franklin Central 28, Terre Haute North 21. \nGreenfield-Central (3-5) at New Castle (1-7), 7:30 p.m.: Greenfield-Central looks to match last year's win total. Greenfield-Central 48, New Castle 21. \nHamilton Heights (5-3) at Northwestern (4-4): Hamilton Heights looks to string a couple wins together before the sectional. Hamilton Heights 28, Northwestern 17. \nIndian Creek (5-3) at South Decatur (5-3): Indian Creek looks to make it five wins in a row. Indian Creek 43, South Decatur 22. \nBroad Ripple (1-7) at Franklin County (5-3): Broad Ripple has scored just 14 points the last four weeks. Franklin County 34, Broad Ripple 7. \nLutheran (4-4) at Manual (3-4): Lutheran defeated Manual 61-0 last season. Lutheran 42, Manual 6. \nMarshall (0-8) at Howe (5-3): Interested to see how far Howe can go in the tournament. Howe 55, Marshall 7. \nNorthwest (5-3) at Heritage Christian (6-2): Heritage Christian looks to bounce back from big loss to Howe last week. Heritage Christian 41, Northwest 33. \nCardinal Ritter (4-4) at Park Tudor (1-7): The odd scenario where these teams will meet again next week in the sectional. Cardinal Ritter 42, Park Tudor 13. Bishop Chatard football to host its first home game \nShortridge (2-6) at Bishop Chatard (5-3): Chatard hosts a game for the first time. Bishop Chatard 62, Shortridge 6. \nTech (4-4) at Lafayette Jeff (6-2): Tech has won three in a row. Lafayette Jeff 33, Tech 21. \nTindley (1-4) at North Decatur (5-3): Tindley plays Indiana Deaf in the sectional next week. North Decatur 45, Tindley 14. \nLapel (4-4) at Eastern Hancock (8-0): Eastern Hancock can wrap up an unbeaten regular season. Eastern Hancock 45, Lapel 24. \nLebanon (2-6) at Western Boone (7-1): Western Boone preps for top-ranked West Lafayette next week. Western Boone 49, Lebanon 21. \nMartinsville (0-8) at Plainfield (4-4): Long year for Martinsville. Plainfield 34, Martinsville 14. \nMonrovia (7-1) vs. Scecina (4-4), at Tech: Monrovia can grab a piece of the Indiana Crossroads Conference title with a win. Monrovia 42, Scecina 30. \nMooresville (4-4) at Beech Grove (6-2): These teams are in the same sectional. Beech Grove 35, Mooresville 31. \nNew Palestine (8-0) at Delta (6-2), 7:30 p.m.: New Palestine faces maybe its toughest challenge of the regular season. Its closest margin so far is 42 points. New Palestine 49, Delta 17. \nNoblesville (3-5) at Avon (6-2): Avon gets Brownsburg next week in the sectional. Avon 42, Noblesville 21. \nNorth Central (0-8) at Ben Davis (4-4): Ben Davis preps for Pike, next week's sectional opponent. Ben Davis 48, North Central 14. \nOldenburg Academy (5-3) at Washington (1-6): Washington has been shut out three times. Oldenburg Academy 34, Washington 14. \nPerry Meridian (5-3) at Bloomington South (8-0): A win would give Perry Meridian its first six-win season since 2003. Bloomington South 30, Perry Meridian 24. \nPike (3-5) at Lawrence North (2-6): Both teams are a lot better than records would indicate. Part of the deal in the MIC. Lawrence North 34, Pike 33. \nShelbyville (7-1) at Pendleton Heights (3-5), 7:30 p.m.: Shelbyville has won three in a row in this series. Shelbyville 42, Pendleton Heights 28. \nSouth Putnam (5-3) at Cascade (4-4): Cascade last defeated South Putnam in 2006.

Arlington 42, Switzerland County 12. \nTriton Central (4-4) at Speedway (2-6): Triton Central looks to bounce back from loss to Beech Grove. Triton Central 30, Speedway 20. \nTri-West (5-3) at North Montgomery (6-2): These teams are tied for second in the Sagamore Conference behind Western Boone. Tri-West 38, North Montgomery 34. \nYorktown (3-5) at Mt. Vernon (4-4), 7:30 p.m.: Tough one-point loss for Mt. Vernon last week, to Shelbyville. Mt. Vernon 24, Yorktown 20. \nZionsville (3-5) at Fishers (5-3): Zionsville has lost four in a row. Fishers 35, Zionsville 21. \nSaturday's games \nAlabama Deaf at Indiana Deaf (6-2): Indiana Deaf ended a two-game losing streak by beating Washington last week.
