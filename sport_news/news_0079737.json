Television news reports from the coast showed toppled trees and lampposts, and inundated streets. Milenio TV carried footage of cars and buses being swept by floodwaters in the state of Jalisco.\n\"The first reports confirm that the damage has been less than those expected from a hurricane of this magnitude,\" President Enrique Pena Nieto said in a taped address late Friday. He added, however, that \"we cannot yet let our guard down.\"\nPatricia weakened to a Category 2 hurricane early Saturday with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and was expected to dissipate over Mexico's inland mountains, becoming a tropical storm later in the day. Its center was about 135 miles southwest of Zacatecas, Mexico.\nTourist Brandie Galle of Grants Pass, Oregon said she had been sheltered with other guests in a ballroom with boarded-up windows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Puerto Vallarta. When the city was not feeling any major effects from the storm two hours after landfall, workers let them out to eat at a hotel restaurant.\n\"They said it looked like the storm had hit below us,\" she said. \"Everyone is starting to perk up a little bit but still kind of on edge waiting to see what's going to happen with the storm.\"\nGalle said some guests desperate to leave had earlier paid $400 for taxis to drive them the 120 miles to the inland city of Guadalajara.\nThe airports in Puerto Vallarta, Manzanillo and Tepic were closed Friday, but officials announced an air bridge Saturday to ferry stranded travelers out of areas hit by the storm.\nResidents and tourists had hunkered down in shelters and homes along a coastal stretch dotted with sleepy fishing villages and gleaming resorts. In Puerto Vallarta, residents had reinforced homes with sandbags and shop windows with boards and tape, and hotels rolled up beachfront restaurants.\nThe Sokols, a family of five from suburban Detroit, were supposed to fly out of Puerto Vallarta on Friday but ended up for hours in a shelter at a university after their flight was canceled. By night they were back where they began: at their hotel, and no worse for wear.\n\"It's amazing it went from the worst in history to just some heavy rain,\" Susanna Sokol said, noting that at least the hurricane gave her daughter a birthday to remember.\n\"It was pretty stressful for a while,\" Tom Sokol said. \"I felt guilty for taking my kids here.\"\nPatricia formed suddenly Tuesday as a tropical storm and quickly strengthened to a hurricane. Within 30 hours it had zoomed to a Category 5 storm, catching many off guard with its rapid growth.\nBy Friday it was the most powerful recorded hurricane to hit the hemisphere, with a central pressure of 880 millibars and maximum sustained winds of 200 mph (325 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center.\nPatricia's power while still out at sea was comparable to that of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 dead or missing in the Philippines two years ago, according to the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization. More than 4 million people were displaced and over 1 million houses were destroyed or damaged in 44 provinces in the central Visayas region, a large cluster of islands.\nMexican officials declared a state of emergency in dozens of municipalities in Colima, Nayarit and Jalisco states, and schools were closed. Many residents bought supplies ahead of Patricia's arrival. Authorities opened hundreds of shelters and announced plans to shut off electricity as a safety precaution.\nOne of the worst Pacific hurricanes to ever hit Mexico slammed into the same region, in Colima state, in October 1959, killing at least 1,500 people, according to Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention.\nU.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said tens of thousands of American citizens were believed to be vacationing or living in areas likely to be affected by the storm.\nPatricia also threatens Texas with forecasters saying that even after the storm breaks, up its tropical moisture will likely feed heavy rains already soaking the state.\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said a flash flood watch would be in effect through Sunday morning for Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio.\nA coastal flood warning was in effect through Friday night in Corpus Christi. Galveston was under a coastal flood advisory until Saturday night.", "external_links": ["http://embed.newsinc.com/Single/iframe.html?WID=2&VID=29853483&freewheel=91223&sitesection=advance&height=349&width=620", "http://www.weather.gov/", "http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2015/10/hurricane_patricia_landfall.html", "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/"], "published": "2015-10-24T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:49:33.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
