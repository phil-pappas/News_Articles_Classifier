If they're doomed to inherit the fiscal ills of their elders, shouldn't they have a constitutional say in helping determine that future even if the vast majority of that age aren't intellectually mature or politically sophisticated enough to handle such responsibility?\nIt's a crazy idea, because the onus should be protecting the 99% even if it might unfairly punish that special 1%.\nLSU running back Leonard Fournette is one of those rarities. He's ready for the NFL now — a quarter into his sophomore season. He gains little taking another snap for the Tigers. And he legitimately earns even less (at least in actual spendable dollars) continually playing a sport that perpetuates a sham of amateurism. LSU hosts Eastern Michigan tonight.\nBut while the NFL rule mandating that college players wait three years before gaining draft eligibility seems unnecessarily punitive to Fournette, it must be viewed within the larger context of hopefully saving the other 19-year-olds who crazily think they're ready for the physical and emotional rigors of NFL football at a high level.\nLSU coach Les Miles said this week that he doesn't see any scenario in which Fournette would sit out his junior season, saving himself for the 2017 NFL draft. And, of course, Miles blamed the media.\n\"What you have to realize is that people are going to say things,\" Miles said. \"If you're gainfully employed and you're sitting in front of a microphone, you have to say something that stirs the pot. OK? So to me, there's a lot of people stirring the pot just to make controversy.\"\nThe smartest strategy for Fournette is playing next season. But this also is where the NCAA should provide even better injury insurance protection for the top-rated running backs. It's fair without being foolish.\nEveryone has the right to fail if they so choose. But isn't there also a greater responsibility to reduce the collective risk of failure — even if it means potentially unfairly penalizing those rare talents?\n■ Somebody's picking off the picks: A disappointed Mystic One believes somebody's tipping off his picks before he makes them. But even worse, they immediately gave the picks right back to him because they considered them ridiculous. An 11-7 record for the season after a 4-2 week against the point spread last week for the all-seeing, all-knowing famed seer, sage, soothsayer and former Matthew Stafford optometrist …The Great Boodini.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nStaff picks: Smooth sailing for MSU, Michigan\nPurdue (plus-24) at MSU — Still seeking an appropriate cable program that best reflects their program, Mark Dantonio turned down HBO's attempts at doing a \"Hard Knocks\" kind of documentary. And \"Duck Dynasty\" no longer is an option following Oregon's collapse. MSU finally finds the right fit: a show that chronicles a team constantly screwing up the point spread. Pick: MSU (finally)\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMSU vs. Purdue: Scouting report, prediction\nU-M (minus-12) at Maryland — The National Hurricane Service expressed concerns that an unusually big gust of wind was a result of the approaching mammoth storm named Joaquin. After further analysis, it was confirmed it was nothing more than a mass of hot air that the Wolverines had returned to national prominence. Pick: U-M\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMichigan at Maryland: Scouting report, prediction\nOhio State (minus-18) at Indiana — This is the first time the Hoosiers have started 4-0 since 1990. That was the last time an OSU QB completed a pass to a receiver that wore a uniform remotely close to what the OSU QB donned in the game. Pick: Indiana\nMinnesota (plus-6 1 / 2 ) at Northwestern — Pick: Minnesota\nIowa (plus-8) at Wisconsin — Pick: Iowa\nNebraska (minus-7 1 / 2 ) at\nIllinois — Pick: Nebraska\nContact Drew Sharp: dsharp@freepress.com.
