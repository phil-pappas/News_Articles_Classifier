Richard Codey (D-Essex) will soon introduce a bill that penalizes athletes who repeat a middle-school grade just to gain a physical advantage, essentially stripping them of a year of high school eligibility in athletics.\nAnything that prevents redshirting is a fine idea in theory, and even though its proponents seem preoccupied by trivialities, this bill could dissuade dozens of families from adding to the municipal tax burden each year.\nThat in itself is enough to endorse it: It costs an average of $18,891 annually to educate a pupil in New Jersey, and the school district deserves to examine whether it is obligated to pay for an extra year of tuition. Students should not be allowed to repeat a grade, other than in cases of academic performance or medical reasons, if taxpayers are footing the bill.\nBut if parents want to gamble their own money on an extra year of tuition at a private or parochial school, that is their business. Codey's bill should make that distinction, because government makes a lousy parent.\nMORE STAR-LEDGER EDITORIALS The rest of it, however, sounds like sour grapes in a postgame locker room. Some say Codey's bill is necessary because the more developed repeaters put smaller athletes at risk in football. News flash: Smaller athletes are always at risk in collision sports. So are larger athletes.\nSome say too many parents are delusional, and that scholarships are too often an unrealistic goal. If that's the case, their son probably is not an opponent you mark on the calendar, and we don't need a law partly designed to destroy his dream.\nSome say parents and schools want to showcase the athlete against inferior competition, but recruiters aren't stupid: They recognize the competition,and know that if an athlete is special, he's been competing against older and bigger kids his entire life.\nBesides, students already are ineligible to compete if they turn 19 before Sept. 1 of any school year, so holding a kid back because he was born late in a calendar year isn't always a game-changer.\nAnd there are ways to circumvent the Codey Law: Parents will simply hold their kids out before middle school (\"Nothing I can do about that,\" the Senator admits), or, after fifth grade, they'll move the playing field by finding a sympathetic gym teacher/vice-principal willing to hold him back for academics.\n\"Shame on them, the coach and the parents,\" Codey replies. \"That's a hell of a message to send to the kid.\"\nTrue. But before we lecture parents about prioritizing athletics over academics, let's look over the playing field again.\nMany schools already are guilty of shameless recruiting: Try finding a list of hometowns for players at those Bergen County football factories, particularly the transfers from other districts, because you won't find it. The coaches are often guilty of using kids' backs as stepping-stones to that long-coveted college gig. The media is preoccupied with televising the Pop Warner Super Bowl on ESPN or ranking the best eight-graders on Middleschoolelite.com. And parents use their kids like a meal ticket.\nA law that eliminates redshirting won't move the needle on the real debate: What some consider gaming the system, others would label parental foresight.\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @StarLedger and find us on Facebook .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Star.Ledger", "https://twitter.com/starledger"], "published": "2015-10-10T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:52:29.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
