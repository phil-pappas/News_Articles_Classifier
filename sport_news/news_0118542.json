But I served well and I'm really happy I'm in the semifinals.\" \nVinci, who has won 10 of her last 11 matches, next faces the winner of the quarterfinal between Venus Williams and Johanna Konta later Thursday. \nAlso, fifth-seeded Garbine Muguruza of Spain coasted to a 6-2, 6-2 win over Anna Karolina Schmiedlova. \n\"You don't play at this level every day, so for me it was great to be playing like this,\" said Muguruza, who converted on five of her seven break opportunities. \nMuguruza, who needed just 72 minutes to dispatch her Slovakian opponent, will play either Angelique Kerber or Coco Vandeweghe in Friday's semifinals. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:18:34.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
