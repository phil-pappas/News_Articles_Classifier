By MyJoyOnline \nReports in Nigeria indicate that former Super Eagles first-choice goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama is expected to meet with top officials of the Nigeria Football Federation over his recent decision to retire from international football. \nThe 33-year-old's decision to quit on Thursday followed a public clash with Super Eagles head coach Sunday Oliseh at the team's training camp a day earlier. \nHe is expected to meet with the NFF president Amaju Pinnick, as well as his two vice-presidents - Seyi Akinwunmi and Shehu Dikko - who are in Belgium for the friendlies against Congo DR and Cameroon. \nThe Lille goalkeeper's retirement comes after 13 years of service. \nHe has been captain of the Super Eagles since taking over from Joseph Yobo in 2013 and led the team to the Africa Cup of Nations title that year as well as the last-16 of the World Cup in 2014. \nEnyeama is the most capped Nigerian player after a 101 appearances. \nHe has been replaced as skipper by young striker Ahmed Musa - a development that actually ignited the fire between Enyeama and Oliseh. \nNigeria, who are preparing for their opening 2014 World Cup qualifier against either Djibouti or Swaziland next month, lost 2:0 to Congo DR on Thursday and will meet Cameroon on Sunday. \nStory by Ghana/Joy Sports/Gary Al-Smith", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:26:31.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
