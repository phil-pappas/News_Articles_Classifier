The 36-year-old was sacked four times and took several other hard shots, including a blow to the chin that left him dazed. \nWhile he was cleared of a concussion, McCown's shoulder injury could keep him out of this week's home game against Arizona. \nMcCown would not comment on his playing status. He was replaced by Johnny Manziel, who would get the nod against the Cardinals if McCown can't play. \nManziel, who won his only start earlier this season, is also dealing with an NFL investigation into a recent domestic dispute. \nMcCown has been impressed with Manziel's weekly preparation as a backup. \nOnline: AP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:01:00.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
