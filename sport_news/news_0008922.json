But even at the nation's best schools, it's tough to find two truly elite prospects playing alongside one another at the high school level. When two top talents do get paired up on the same squad, it usually means talk of package deals, increased recruiting interest for the rest of the roster, as well as individual accolades and expectations of state championships. In this week's First and 10, we go around the country to find the 10 best pairs of high school teammates, regardless of class. QB Shea Patterson (No. 1) and LB Rahshaun Smith (No. 14) Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy \nAmerica's most loaded high school team has a college-bound prospect at nearly every position, and multiple other names could have made this list. Patterson (No.1) and Smith (No. 14) are the two most highly ranked players on the roster. Patterson (above), an Ole Miss commit, makes the lethal IMG offense go, while Smith, an uncommitted prospect, anchors the program's defense. Bother players are seen as on-field leaders in addition to elite-level talents. -- Rob Cassidy, Southeast analyst WR Trevon Grimes (No. 6, 2017) and DE Nick Bosa (No. 15) Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) St. Thomas Aquinas \nAquinas is another school that boasts more than just two highly touted teammates, but Grimes (above) and Bosa carry the highest ranking. Bosa, an Ohio State commit, is as formidable a defensive presence as there is in the country. He boasts a college-ready body and some surprising quickness for his size. Meanwhile, Grimes is the No.1-ranked junior in Florida and brings an impressive speed-size combination to the table. The 6-foot-4 wide receiver is uncommitted but a seemingly safe bet to eventually join Bosa at Ohio State. -- Cassidy CB Levonta Taylor (No. 12) and Khalan Laborn (No. 34, 2017) Virginia Beach (Va.) Ocean Lakes \nOcean Lakes has been dominating the competition this season, outscoring opponents 260-26 through five games so far. Taylor, the top cornerback in the country, hasn't been getting many balls thrown in his direction this year. Teams seem to really shy away from him which makes sense because he's a five-star and committed to Florida State . The only thing holding Laborn (above) back is the fact that Ocean Lakes is scoring too many points. Laborn has only played in the first half of most games this year, carrying the ball 49 times for 843 yards and scoring 13 times. It's pretty incredible that he's averaging almost 18 yards per carry. -- Adam Friedman, Mid-Atlantic analyst WR D.J. Matthews (No. 16, 2017) and DB Shaun Wade (No. 19, 2017) Jacksonville (Fla.) Trinity Christian \nA couple of juniors, Matthews (above) and Wade play on the same 7-on-7 squad as well as on the same high school team. One of the best wide receivers in America, Matthews is a long-time Florida State commit, while Wade, a long, athletic defensive back, is committed to Ohio State. Florida is still heavily involved in Wade's recruitment, while Matthews is seen as extremely solid in his pledge to the Seminoles. -- Cassidy QB Tate Martell (No. 18, 2017) and WR Tyjon Lindsey (No. 20, 2017) Las Vegas (Nev.) Bishop Gorman \nA dynamic quarterback and his favorite offensive target, Martell (above) and Lindsey are two key cogs to one of the country's most exciting and productive high school offenses. Martell has been a fixture on the recruiting scene for years, and the playmaking quarterback has already committed to Texas A&M . With his commitment set, he has turned his sites to bringing the versatile Lindsey with him to the Lone Star State. Lindsey is an X-factor with the ball in his hands and is looking to find the perfect offensive to utilize his talents at the next level. -- Woody Wommack, Southeast analyst ATH Brandon Burton (No. 47) and DE Wole Betiku (No. 36) Gardena (Calif.) Junipero Serra \nThe Serra defense is absolutely loaded but with Betiku in the front seven and Burton (above) patrolling the secondary, it's tough for opponents to move the ball. Betiku has come off the edge really well this season using his physical play and aggression to dominate offensive tackles. Burton, who also shines at receiver, is so fast sideline to sideline that he can track down any play. On deep balls, Burton is great in coverage and is never shy to lay the wood. -- Adam Gorney, National analyst OT Landon Young (No. 91) and OT Jedrick Wills (No. 13, 2017) Lexington (Ky.) Lafayette \nWith each of them being bigger than 6-foot-5 and 300 pounds, it would be tough to find a bigger pair of tackles on any high school team in the country. Young (above) has steadily risen to the Rivals100 and he continues to get better every time we see him. Wills was very impressive at the Five-Star Challenge this past summer and earned his spot among the class of 2017's initial five-stars. Young is bound for Kentucky and Wildcats fans are hoping he can bring Wills along with him. -- Wommack WR Dylan Crawford (No. 90) and QB K.J. Costello (No. 28) Racho Santa Margarita (Calif.) Santa Margarita Catholic \nCrawford (above) transferred to Santa Margarita for his senior season and it's worked out well so far. He and Costello played on the same 7-on-7 team and they have tremendous chemistry together. It could impact Crawford's college decision with Stanford as one of the options. Costello has not had tremendous talent at wide receiver during his time at Santa Margarita and now Crawford gives him that. -- Gorney OG Michael Onwenu (No. 83) and WR Donovan Peoples-Jones (No. 44, 2017) Detroit (Mich.) Cass Tech \nCass Tech is an FBS pipeline, sending 23 players to the Power Five level in just the past decade. This is also not the first time they have had two prospects on the team ranked in the Top 100 of their respective classes. And, on this Cass Tech team, Onwenu (above) and Peoples-Jones represent just half of the Technician's four-star prospects. They are the highest ranked, and both are coming off exceptional summers that saw them earn major awards at national showcase events. The 6-foot-3, 367-pound Onwenu is committed to Michigan , while Peoples-Jones is open and evaluating more than 15 scholarship offers. -- Josh Helmholdt, Midwest analyst DT Rashan Gary (No. 2) and LB Drew Singleton (No. 144, 2017) Paramus (N.J.) Catholic \nEvery college football fan has had their eyes fixed on Gary (above) since before the season started. Every twist and turn in the five-star's recruitment has been interesting to analyze. Gary had his best game of the season last weekend against Oradell (N.J.) Bergen Catholic. He dominated the offensive line from his defensive tackle position, getting sacks, tackles for a loss, beating double and triple teams and freeing up his teammates to make plays. One of the beneficiaries of Gary's play has been Singleton. The 2017 Rivals250 linebacker has all the physical tools to be a star in college football and he has gotten much better at quick deciphering the play and flowing to the ball. Singleton's game has really improved this season and Paramus Catholic's opponents are having to gameplan against him as well as Gary. -- Friedman \nBlair Angulo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:28:36.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
