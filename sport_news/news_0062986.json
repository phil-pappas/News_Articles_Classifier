He's a friend and a great guy, but I'm through to the final and there's one more match to go.\" \nThat will come against American Sock, who won his first tour title in Houston this year. \nThe seventh seed knocked out number two Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-2 in a clinical display that ended with four successive aces.
