The Crusaders may be just what the doctor or­dered, having given up 43 points to Alvirne last week. Misael Oquendo (207 total yards) is a threat North has to be wary of. \nEXETER (7-0) at MERRIMACK (4-3) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \nWHERE: Merrimack's Student Memorial Field. \n2014 RESULT: Did not play. \nLAST WEEK: Salem 37 Mer­rimack 26; Exeter 37, Dover 14. \nFYI: The Tomahawks have been up in the second half of a few games down this tough stretch of contenders on their schedule, but inexperience has hurt them despite the play of junior QB Justin Grassini (249 yards pass­ing last week). The 'Hawks will have to defend against Exeter's running game (350 yards last week). Mason Wallace is a break­away threat for the Blue Hawks. \nALVIRNE (1-6) at BEDFORD (6-1) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Did not play. \nLAST WEEK: Alvire 43, Man­chester Memorial 35; Bedford 28, Concord 14. \nFYI: This will be a tough one for the Broncos despite their success last week, but it won't take away from the year run­ning back Brad Kamal is having (289 yards, four TDs last week). Bedford's win last week clinched a playoff berth, so now it's a case of seeding and staying healthy for the Bulldogs. \nCENTRAL (3-4) at NASHUA SOUTH (2-5) \nWHEN: Saturday, 1 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Did not play. \nLAST WEEK: Keene 45, Nashua South 14; Goffstown 53, Man­chester Central 7. \nFYI: Both teams will be looking to rebound from awful losses. South, after improving in a win over Alvirne, regressed, espe­cially defensively vs. Keene. Collin Morrow (TD last week) continues to have a good season after returning from injury, but the Panthers need more. Central is looking to keep its faint playoff hopes alive; South (allowing 43.4 points a game) is looking to avoid its first losing season in recent memory. \nBISHOP GUERTIN (5-2) at GOFFSTOWN (7-0) \nWHEN: Saturday, 1:30 p.m. \n2014 Result: Did not play. \nLAST WEEK: Bishop Guertin 54, Nashua North 14; Goffstown 53, Manchester North 7. \nFYI: Another big game for the Cardinals, who likely need one out of their last two to clinch a playoff spot. The points will fly in this one, as not only is Grizzlies' QB Casey Gervais a threat, but back Connor Bourque (seven TDs last week) as well. Guertin can match scores, but at some point its Joe Goudey/Chase Hughes-led defense, which played well last week, will have to come through against a bigger opponent. \nDIVISION II \nHOLLIS BROOKLINE (2-5) at MONADNOCK (4-3) \nWHEN: Friday, 6:30 p.m. \nWHERE: Monadnock Regional High School \n2014 RESULT: Hollis Brookline 23, Monadnock 14. \nLAST WEEK: Sanborn 9, Monadnock 8; ConVal 25, Hollis Brookline 14. \nFYI: A season ravaged by injuries will come to an end for the Cavaliers, and they obvi­ously hope to go out on a good note. Monadnock, meanwhile, is looking to snap a two-game losing streak after winning four straight, and with Windham looming as a regular season fina­le, it may need this one to secure a winning season and keep any faint post season hopes alive. \nSOUHEGAN (5-1) at CONVAL (2-4) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \nWHERE: ConVal Regional in Peterborough \n2014 RESULT: Souhegan 53, Con-Val 21 \nLAST WEEK: Souhegan 41, Trinity 21; ConVal 25, Hollis Brookline 14. \nFYI: The Sabers are cruising, led by QB Michael Mancini, and ConVal (three wins in its last 27 games) just isn't in the same class, although its having a much better season than in the past with two of those three wins coming in recent weeks. Brandon Carland has played well defen­sively for the Cougars. \nMILFORD (5-1) at WINDHAM (6-0) \nWHEN: Saturday, 1:30 p.m. \n2014 Result: Windham 41, Milford 0 \nLAST WEEK: Windham 39, Pel­ham 19; Milford did not play. \nFYI: Don't look for a 41-0 game this time around. The Spartans have had two weeks to prepare, and this is simply a huge game to keep pace with the playoff contenders. The Spartans will look to stop the passing of Jaguars QB Griffin Lippold (124 yards, three TDs last week) and the rushing of back Shane LaFond (80 yards on just five carries). \nDIVISION III \nCAMPBELL (2-4) at BISHOP BRADY (4-2) \nWHEN: Saturday, 7 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Campbell 35, Bishop Brady 0 \nLAST WEEK: Campbell 42, Farmington-Nute 6; Somer­sworth 21, Bishop Brady 9. \nFYI: The two teams seem to be on the reverse side of things this season. Brady lost a tough one last week but the Green Giants will be a test with the running of Moses Murenzi, the passing of QB Max Joyce and the receiving of Chris Thurber. The Cougars got back on the winning track last week behind QB Hunter Han­non (two TDs) and hope to win their last two to finish at .500.
