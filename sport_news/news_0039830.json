A loss would mean that, once again, Huntington's lack of bold, masses-pleasing moves to improve the club will be under the microscope from die-hards and bandwagoners alike. A loss would nudge the Pirates' growing fan base toward the first queasy looks toward the future and the asking of a question that, thanks to three straight magical regular seasons, can't be avoided:\nHow much longer can the fun last?\nSelf-described Pirates lunatic Matt Wein, who grew up perennially dreaming of better times with the Pirates of 1993-2012 and was rewarded in 2013-15 along with thousands of others, can't help assessing the Pirates' window for success.\n\"Two years ago a lot of people, myself included, were so taken up in the moment that you weren't thinking about next year in the way you'd been conditioned to,\" says Wein, 32. \"It was so easy to get caught up in the moment, and what a moment to get caught up in, where 40,000 people are yelling 'Cueto, Cueto' and the guy drops the ball.\n\"Now that it's here, and it's consistent, and we see evidence of sustainability, of a methodology, you do think about it, especially in the context of: These guys have the second-best record in the majors this year and they have to play in the playoffs against the third-best team in the majors? That's messed up. If baseball is going to punish these guys for being in the same division as the Cardinals, which is essentially happening, I do worry about the window.\"\nSharing a division with the Cardinals and Cubs, the Pirates' margin for error will be small. But Tim Dierkes, the founder of the MLB Trade Rumors blog, sees them staying competitive because of the skill that Huntington has shown working around the edges.\n\"I don't think the Pirates' window needs to close,\" said Dierkes, a Cubs fan who lives in suburban Chicago. \"A lot of why they're good this year was just savvy decision-making that was available to any team. Anybody could have seen (Jung Ho) Kang, a lot of teams could have traded for (catcher Francisco) Cervelli. (Starling) Marte is from the Dominican Republic. Those are the kind of moves anybody can make.\"\nHuntington will have to continue to make those types of moves.\n\"Most of our decisions have been a willingness to tip the scale toward the present, but not to completely overwhelm the scale to the present,\" Huntington said. \"Because our goal is to bring playoff caliber baseball to PNC Park as many times as we can. ... We are not an organization that believes in going in on one year at all costs.\"\nThe consensus is that the Pirates' current window will last as long as they have Andrew McCutchen. He is one of the only players in baseball who has that kind of impact, and the Pirates have him locked up for 2016-17 at the incredible bargain price of $13.2 million and $14.2 million, with a club option for 2018. So, the window could be a maximum of three more years.\nMcCutchen, who turns 29 Saturday, is likely to command $25 million to $30 million a year as a free agent if he continues to turn in MVP-caliber seasons. Precedent dictates that the Pirates won't spend that kind of money, even for the face of the franchise. If that is the case, will they trade him for a worthy haul of prospects to help extend their window, or will they let him become a free agent in 2018 and receive nothing for him other than a compensatory draft pick?\nBut the Pirates will have more pressing decisions before McCutchen. It appears as if the Pirates could bring back their entire nucleus next season other than starting pitcher A.J. Burnett, who plans to retire, and pitcher J.A. Happ. But before 2017, they will have to address hometown favorite Neil Walker, dependable closer Mark Melancon and slugger Pedro Alvarez.\nHuntington knows some of those decisions will be painful.\n\"We want our fans to think with their hearts,\" Huntington said, \"and we want our fans to love this team and these guys. Our challenge is, we need to remain focused on the big picture.\n\"There will be points in time in the future where we don't keep every free agent they want us to, and we may trade players our fans want us to keep, but it's all in the name of maintaining this successful run.\"\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733628&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733628&h=Could+the+Pirates%27+success+window+close+before+advancing+further+into+playoffs", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733628"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:16:17.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
