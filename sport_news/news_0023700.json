Morton claimed its second consecutive Class 2A boys state golf championship on Saturday at Weibring Golf Club at Illinois State and did it convincingly. The Potters ran away from the field, posting a second-day 304 four-player team aggregate and a two-day total of 615 which was 23 strokes better than runner-up Wheaton St. Francis. Dunlap (322-639) rallied in the final two holes to grab third, finishing one stroke ahead of Vernon Hills and one shot behind WSF. Individually, Metamora’s Trey Tussey shot 2-under 69 for a 143 total to finish second — three shots behind individual champion Drew Miles of Wilmette North Shore Country Day (69-71). But the day belonged to the Cherry and Grey of the defending champions. “It’s just an overwhelming day of emotion,” Morton coach Jamie King said. “It’s incredibly exciting to be back-to-back state champs.” Morton was the only team to put four scores in the 70s on the final day. The Potters’ 23-stroke Class 2A victory margin is the largest since the IHSA went to a class system in 1975. Despite its convincing win, Morton stumbled once again at the start. Pete Kuhl triple-bogeyed his second hole, Isaac Ingold doubled his first and was 5-over-par after four holes. Bobby Strode started his day bogey-bogey for the Potters. “We preach about adversity and how you will act and respond to it,” King said. “We’ve been here before. We know everybody is going to have a bad hole or two, and it’s how you respond. “I was hopeful the guys would take the approach of one hole at a time and erase the last one. They did that.” “We were confident we were the best team going into this and we just had to perform to it,” King said. “They did, and came up big.” Strode, a sophomore, birdied the ninth hole for a front nine 39 and came home with a 38, including one of just five birdie 2s on the always difficult 17th, for a career-best 77. It was the type of score Morton needed to put the defending champions at ease. “You have to be ecstatic for Bobby Strode,” said King. “He comes out and produces his best round on the biggest day of the season.” “A huge boost for us, knowing Bobby came in with a score like that,” Pete Kuhl said. Said Strode, “My teammates had my back yesterday when I didn’t play well, and when they didn’t play well today I had their back.” Defending indvidual state champion Tommy Kuhl rebounded from his 81 on Friday with a team-low 72 which tied for the fourth-lowest score on the day, and — more importantly — helped push Morton’s lead late in the day. Page 2 of 2 - “I certainly didn’t want to come out today and have the same round as yesterday,” Tommy Kuhl said. “I took it one shot at a time. Yesterday I think I forced it. Today, I just kind of put yesterday aside and moved on.” The defending state medalist had four bogeys and three birdies in shooting a pair of 36s. Ingold settled down and played his final 14 holes at 3-over. The sophomore had an impressive up-and-in on the 18th hole, draining a 15-footer for par. Pete Kuhl could do no better than a 41 on the front after tripling the second hole. The Wisconsin commit came home in even-par 35. “I didn’t have my best stuff today and it was definitely noticeable,” Pete Kuhl said. “To get the team title, that is all that matters to me. “Individually, it would have been nice to play better, but you can’t ask for much more.” Class 3A boys Pekin’s Lance Hays had an 86 Saturday in the final round, following Friday’s opening-day 82. The 168 total in the Class 3A state final at The Den at Fox Creek left the Dragons junior in tie for 67th place. With the help of birdies at Nos. 10 and 16, Pekin sophomore Mason Ghidina improved by eight strokes Saturday to shoot an 84. He had a 176 for 36 holes to finish tied for 93rd. Justin Hemings of Edwardsville fired a 145 to win 3A state individual honors. Hinsdale Central was the team champ by three over Winnetka New Trier with a 621. Class AA girls Allison Kinsinger of Washington was comfortably in the upper half of the field at the IHSA Class AA state final. The Lady Panthers junior tied for 46th out of 109 players at Hickory Point Golf Club with a 167 that included an 86 on Day 2 Saturday. An even-par 144 gave Rockford Guilford’s Madasyn Pettersen an individual state championship. Hinsdale Central won the team crown by 18 strokes with a 617.
