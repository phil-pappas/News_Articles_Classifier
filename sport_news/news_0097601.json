But privately, Royals teammate Edinson Volquez said Cueto was complaining about something more sinister.\n“He said [Monday] night, they got a guy in centerfield,” Volquez said.\nAccusations of sign-stealing against the Blue Jays are nothing new. In 2011, then-Yankee and current Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin accused Toronto of stealing signs, and the Boston Red Sox went to great pains to disguise their signs during their series there that year. Players talked about a fabled, as-yet unidentified “man in white,” who allegedly relayed signs from centerfield.\n“Most of the teams come here—we’ve got a lot of friends on different teams, they always say that, they give the signs or whatever it is,” Volquez said.\nTold about Volquez’s comments on the field as the Blue Jays took batting practice, Toronto manager John Gibbons simply shook his head, brushing Volquez’s words off entirely.\nEven if the Jays were stealing signs, Volquez said, it’s still on Cueto to defend against that. “That’s your fault,” Volquez said. “You’ve got to hide the ball and have better communication with the catcher giving you signs when you’re pitching. So it’s nothing wrong with it. We just have to hide the ball and give multiple signs to hide it from them.”\nCueto left the field after batting practice on Tuesday without speaking to reporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:54:14.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
