But the Badgers (6-2, 3-1 Big Ten) didn't miss a beat with Houston. \nThe junior found his favorite target, Alex Erickson, for a 9-yard touchdown with 9:42 left in the game to give Wisconsin a 24-13 lead and effectively put the game away. \nErickson led the Badgers in receiving with 10 catches for 96 yards and had four rushes for 81 yards. \nWes Lunt had 278 yards passing with one interception for Illinois (4-3, 1-2). \nThe Badgers also lost starting center Dan Voltz in the second half with a leg injury. \nOn the stat sheet, Wisconsin looked in charge midway through the third quarter. The Badgers had advantages in yards, plays run and possession. \nBut Illinois was still well within range, trailing 17-13. \nThat all changed, though, over the next two possessions. \nWisconsin ground out a 13-play, 65-yard drive that chewed up 7 minutes and 39 seconds, and ended with a 9-yard touchdown pass from Houston to Erickson for a two-score advantage. \nThe Badger defense iced it when Lunt threw a ball that linebacker T.J. Edwards tipped and safety Michael Caputo picked off at the Badger's 49. \nIllinois never threatened again. \nBefore Saturday, Houston had thrown just nine passes on the season. He quickly found a rhythm, using mostly short passes. \nSix plays after Stave's exit, Houston threw to Robert Wheelwright, who reached over an Illinois defensive back to pull down a 23-yard touchdown pass. That gave Badgers their first lead at 7-3, less than a minute into the second quarter. \nIllinois was missing starting tailback Josh Ferguson for a second straight game after injuring his right shoulder against Nebraska. \nFreshman Ke'Shawn Vaughn was the only ball carrier for Illinois, finishing with 13 carries for 55 yards. Most of those yards came on Illinois' only touchdown, a 36-yard burst through the middle with 7:48 left in the third quarter to give the Illini a 13-10 lead. \nThe Badgers stayed within a game of Iowa in the Big Ten West with games left against Rutgers, Maryland, Northwestern and Minnesota. None of those teams has a winning record in the conference. \nThe loss pushes the Illini two games back of Iowa and still looking for two wins to gain bowl eligibility. Illinois plays four of its last five on the road — with a home game against No. 1 Ohio State. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:24:27.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
