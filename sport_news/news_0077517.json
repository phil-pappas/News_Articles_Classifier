And I know our pitching staff appreciates it.” \nPillar also enjoyed his best offensive season, batting .278 with 12 homers, 56 RBIs and a .713 OPS. He hit safely in his final 10 games of the regular season and 14 of his last 16. \nEntering Game 2 of the ALCS, he was seven-for-21 with a homer in the post-season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:37:16.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
