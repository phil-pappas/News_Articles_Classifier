Many say the changes will make their commutes a lot harder.\n“Metro has given the short end of the stick to riders of northeast Seattle,” said commuter Jack Papegaay.\n“This restructure would take effect in March of next year and it needs to be done right,” said King County Councilmember Rod Dembowski.\nSupporters of the plan say the tradeoff of transferring on to light rail from a bus will be a more frequent and reliable ride to downtown.\nThe hearing is at 1:30 p.m. Monday.\nSee the list of recommended changes here .\nLIKE KIRO 7 Eyewitness News on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/link-connections/recommendation.html", "https://www.facebook.com/KIRO7Seattle"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:47:07.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
