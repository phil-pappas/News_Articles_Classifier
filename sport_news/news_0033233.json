His performances in 2015 merit the extension and, but for an unfortunate injury, he would have played a near full season of county cricket. During 2015 Nick showed the ability to thrive in all forms of the game,\" said director of cricket Angus Fraser. \n\"We believe Nick is an exciting talent and we know he has an excellent work ethic. The two qualities give him a great chance of having a long and distinguished career in cricket.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:18:59.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
