They came out and played really, really good football the last couple weeks. It should be a really good game.\" \nWashington State edged Arizona on Saturday while Stanford thumped Washington 31-14 to set up the unlikely, high-stakes duel on ESPN. Stanford (6-0, 5-1) is ranked No. 8 in the Associated Press poll released Sunday. Washington State (5-2, 3-1) is the only other team above .500 in the North. \nStanford's victory over Washington was built on run-pass balance and dominance on both sides of the ball. The Cardinal topped the 30-point mark for the sixth consecutive game and gained 478 yards against the Husky defense, the stingiest in the conference. Its point total was the highest Washington has allowed this season. \n\"They executed at a very high level in all three phases,'' Washington coach Chris Petersen said. \"(In the second half), we got a little something going. But they're a good team that can answer right away, which they did. Put us back on our heels.\" \nStanford possessed the ball for 40 minutes, had three long touchdown drives (75 yards or more) and converted 50 percent of its third- and fourth-down opportunities. Advertisement \nTailback Christian McCaffrey, a second-tier Heisman Trophy candidate, finished with 300 all-purpose yards. His total included 109 yards rushing, his fifth consecutive 100-yard game, matching the second-longest streak in school history. Toby Gerhart holds the record, with seven. \nMcCaffrey also had a 50-yard touchdown reception that followed a UW touchdown and squashed any chance of a tight finish. The catch-and-run down the right side with 9:11 left in the third quarter gave Stanford a 24-7 lead. \n\"Just tried to get it to him ... let him do what he does, and he made a guy miss and took it the distance,'' said quarterback Kevin Hogan, who completed 17 of 24 passes for 290 yards and two touchdowns. \nHogan also rushed for 37 yards and looked to be fully recovered from the sprained ankle suffered against USC. \n\"This is the first week where I've felt like I could really move around and not favor it,'' he said. \nStanford's defense, which faced an inexperienced quarterback for the sixth time this season, was equally dominant. \nThe Cardinal overwhelmed UW's K.J. Carta-Samuels, a freshman from San Jose's Bellarmine College Prep who replaced injured starter Jake Browning. Carta-Samuels completed 9 of 21 passes for 118 yards, the majority of which came long after the outcome had been determined. \nWashington didn't cross midfield until early in the second half. \n\"Everyone was talking about the best Pac-12 offense (Stanford) against the best Pac-12 defense (Washington),'' Cardinal linebacker Blake Martinez said. \n\"And we're like hey, what about us? So we went out there with chip on our shoulders and I think we proved a big thing today.\" \nFor more on college sports, see Jon Wilner's College Hotline at blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports .
