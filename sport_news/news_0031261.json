One of those affected by other people’s violence was Emmanuel Kelly, who was abandoned by his parents as a baby. Emmanuel was born with limb deficiencies as a result of chemical warfare in Iraq.\nHe was raised at an orphanage run by Mother Theresa nuns and then rescued from there by his mother Moira Kelly and raised in Australia. In 2011, he participated in X-Factor and sang John Lennon’s Imagine which moved the judges to tears (and tears look more real than anything we’ve seen on reality shows). It's even more touching that he chooses to sing a song like Imagine, particularly after violence he faced earlier in life.

John would have been proud of you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Love, Yoko”.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/6dfc0EYktwI"], "published": "2015-10-09T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:12:46.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
