(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) \nCLEMSON – Game control mattered last year. If it matters this year, Clemson needs more games like this one. \nAfter winning the previous two games by five total points, the sixth-ranked Tigers are following the unsolicited advice of some nosy reporter and clobbering Georgia Tech 33-10 at the orange slices. \nDeshaun Watson, who didn’t light up the passing stat sheet last week vs. Notre Dame, is 15-for-22 for 202 yards and two touchdowns, both to tight end Jordan Leggett. \nLeggett, by the way. Whoosh . Four touchdowns in his last eight quarters of play. \nHow’s this for a positive sign : eight different players, including all seven active receivers, had a catch in the first half. \nWayne Gallman had a career-high 66-yard run on the third play from scrimmage, and has eight carries for 86 yards and a couple rushing scores. \nAnd on the offensive line , freshmen Jake Fruhmorgen (right tackle) and Taylor Hearn (left tackle) are getting some run with the first-team offense. Joe Gore and Mitch Hyatt appear to be healthy, so it’s probably by design. \nThis is the third time in five games Clemson scored on its opening two possessions. \nOn defense, Jayron Kearse talks a big game , and walks a bigger one. He has three tackles for a loss already, which included the 6-5, 220 pound safety absolutely tattooing 5-11, 220-pound A-Back Mikell Lands-Davis. \nCordrea Tankersley had his second career interception , and second in three games, placed gently into his lap by Georgia Tech quarterback Justin Thomas, who for the most part looked lost in that first half. \nThomas did find Clinton Lynch w de-open for a 50-yard touchdown pass. But other than that, Thomas had six throws and eight carries – 14 touches – for nine yards. \nTotal yards: Clemson 318, Georgia Tech 109 . First downs: Clemson 14, Georgia Tech 6. Third-down conversions: Clemson 6-for-9, Georgia Tech 0-for-7. \n-AB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:00:21.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
