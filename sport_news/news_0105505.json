He left the game and did not return; his status for Saturday's Ivy League contest against visiting Brown will be determined this week. \nCornell was already without its second-string running back, freshman Chris Walker, who suffered a concussion in Cornell's 40-3 loss to Harvard a week earlier. Sophomore Josh Sweet saw the most action of his career and gained 80 yards on 22 carries, scoring the Red's lone touchdown early in the second quarter. It was Sweet's first career touchdown. \nJunior quarterback Robert Somborn struggled, completing just 10 of 22 passes for 196 yards with a late interception. Sophomore Jake Jatis was 1-for-3 for 18 yards in limited second-half duty. \nThe Pioneers (4-2) were led by quarterback R.J. Noel, who completed 15 of 22 passes for 270 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He hit Moses Webb from 7 yards out late in the first half to put the home team up, 17-6, then capped the scoring in the fourth quarter with an 80-yard bomb to Tyler Dube, who led all receivers with nine catches for 202 yards, seven yards shy of the school record. \nDube also threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to 300-pound lineman Connor Caveney in the second quarter on a flea-flicker to give the Pioneers a 10-0 lead. \nAfter forcing eight turnovers a week ago in a 26-13 win over Robert Morris, Sacred Heart was able to keep Cornell's offense off balance all day, posting 11 tackles for losses totaling 64 yards. Cornell also hurt itself with five penalties for 50 yards. \nA turning point in the game came early in the second half, with the Red trailing, 17-6. After forcing a Sacred Heart three-and-out, Cornell marched deep into Pioneers territory and appeared to be on the verge of scoring when Sweet was tackled at the end of a 14-yard run near the goal line. \nThe ball popped free and was recovered in the end zone by the home team. Cornell coach David Archer felt Sweet was already down when the ball came loose, but the officials ruled it a fumble and Pioneers ball at the 20 after a touchback. \nSacred Heart marched 80 yards in 14 plays with the ensuing possession to build a three-score lead. Cornell was able to penetrate Pioneers territory just once after that. \nAt the midpoint of the season, Cornell (0-2 Ivies) has just league games the rest of the way, beginning with Saturday's 12:30 p.m. kickoff against the Bears (3-2, 1-1 Ivies), who defeated Princeton on Saturday, 38-31. In other games involving league teams, 24th-ranked Harvard blanked Lafayette, 42-0; Pennsylvania routed Columbia, 42-7; and Yale topped Maine, 21-10. \nLast week, Columbia snapped its 24-game losing streak with a 26-3 defeat of Wagner, leaving the Big Red as the league's lone winless team.
