(AP) - The state's highest court has upheld a jury conviction for a Vermont man charged with animal cruelty after police found dead and emaciated horses on his property.\nBruce Bona was charged with 21 counts of animal cruelty last year after horses were found neglected and lacking proper food and water on his Lyndon ranch.\nBona was convicted on 17 of the counts in Caledonia Superior Court and was later sentenced to spend 15 days in prison as part of a suspended sentence of 20 months to five years. The 65-year-old man must also pay more than $22,000 in restitution. He has not begun serving his sentence due to the pending appeal.\nThe Caledonian Record reports a panel of Justices affirmed Bona's conviction on Wednesday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
