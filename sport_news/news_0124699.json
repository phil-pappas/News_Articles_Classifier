Tony from Seattle wants to know if Colin Kaepernick would fit in Denver The Denver Post Posted: 10/14/2015 02:15:19 PM MDT Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (18) works through drills with backup quarterback Brock Osweiler (17). The Denver Broncos prepare for their upcoming game against Detroit during practice at Dove Valley on Monday, Sept. 21, 2015. ( Kathryn Scott Osler, The Denver Post ) \nDenver Post Broncos writer Troy Renck posts his Broncos Mailbag on Wednesdays during the season. \nYou can pose a Broncos- or NFL-related question for the Broncos Mailbag here . Follow Troy for more daily updates on Twitter and Facebook . \nPeyton Manning has seven interceptions and only six touchdowns. I find it hard to believe Brock Osweiler cannot put up better numbers than this. I'm not calling to bench Manning because I'm just an average fan and I don't see what's happening in practice, but is there a reason this is not even considered? \n— Mike Gomez, Anaheim, Calif. \nMike: Changing quarterbacks involves multiple dynamics. It's not like switching out the right guard. Change a quarterback on any team and you risk disrupting chemistry and lines of communication. Once you make that decision and go down that rabbit hole, it's difficult to crawl back out. As it relates specifically to Manning, there are three reasons it's not considered: he's one of the greatest of all time so he's earned the benefit of the doubt, coach Gary Kubiak believes in him as the leader of a 5-0 team, and Manning is hardly the only reason the offense is struggling (see offensive line, changing left tackles, lack of running game, drops by wide receivers and lack of separation in coverage by tight ends). Advertisement \nI understand fans' angst. Manning's start is jarring when juxtaposed to his previous seasons. In 2013, he had 20 touchdowns and one interception at this juncture. The bigger concern is that Manning owns 11 interceptions and 13 touchdowns over his last 10 regular-season games and hasn't found a comfort level in this new offense. All that said, Manning made plays when he had to — in the final drive against the Ravens, the two-minute drill vs. the Chiefs, and the finishing march against Detroit Lions. Bronco Bus fan forum That's the one part that I miss when fans argue for Osweiler. To make a quarterback change, teams like to have some assurances. Osweiler fits this offense. But he brings the great unknown right now. What evidence has he provided that he could lead a game-winning drive? The counter, I know, is that the Broncos might need it because he would have played better earlier in those games. Again, there's no proof, and the Broncos are 5-0, not 1-4. \nThe issue for Manning is simple going forward: Complete some deep passes to get the defenders off the line of scrimmage, which will open the running game, and eliminate mistakes. He doesn't need to be great for this team to win. Good is all that is necessary. \nDo you think the Broncos offense will turn it up in the second half of the season? They are playing flat and without life or energy, but every game you see them play well for a drive or just enough to help seal the win? Do you think this is a strategy for surviving the second half of the season or even the postseason? \n— Andrew Philp, Ocala, Fla. \nAndrew: The challenge becomes real soon. The Broncos face a gauntlet after the bye. Over a six-week stretch they face the Packers, Colts, Patriots and Chargers. It's hard to see them beating the Packers and Patriots with the 30th-ranked offense, regardless of how many sacks and turnovers the defense produces. \nThey have to be able to change the script. They need to complete some long vertical passes to force defenses to play them more honestly. As it stands, eight and nine defenders are in the box, daring the Broncos to beat them deep. And it also kills the running game because even if the back makes it through the hole he has multiple tacklers waiting for him. That would explain why the Broncos' average third-down conversion is eight yards. That's awful. \nI would go to the shotgun, and look to use quicker slants and swing passes to the running backs to see if that can create some openings. But there are no easy fixes. The offense ranks 30th in yards per game for a reason. \nIn your view, what is the reason (or reasons) that the Broncos offense has gone from nearly unstoppable two years ago to largely ineffective today? Their offensive play is unwatchable and reminds me of the Kyle Orton-led offense of 2009-10: OK between the 20s, but unable to regularly put it in the end zone. With the excellent defense of this year's team, Denver would be a serious Super Bowl contender if the offense could play at the level of two years ago. Maybe they should let Wade Phillips coordinate the offensive game as well as the defensive game. \n— Jim Minelli, Heeney \nJim: There are a number of reasons: from Peyton Manning's play, to the lacking running game, to a mediocre offensive line with changing tackles, to drops by receivers and vanishing tight ends. I do believe this week and the bye offer a chance for even more change in play-calling. I would look to change to formations more in line with last season's to try and create chunk plays in the passing game. Then return to the run. Whatever the case, the Broncos must improve on first down to make their third downs more manageable. \nAny chance the Broncos trade for Colin Kaepernick in the offseason? Denver could use a strong armed, mobile quarterback with big game experience, and Kaepernick could use a change of scenery and a new offensive-minded coach in Kubiak. \n— Tony G., Seattle \nTony: Hard to deal in hypotheticals right now. Osweiler profiles well for this offense. Hard for me to imagine them trading for a struggling quarterback without giving Osweiler a chance, but I have learned not to rule anything out in the NFL. Kaepernick is an amazing athlete. But he's been trending the wrong direction. \nWhat needs to come together to get the running game going? In other words, what is missing from the C.J. Anderson we saw last year looking like a beast that couldn't be stopped? \n— Deborah, Ventura, Calif. \nDeborah: It started in the preseason. He injured his ankle early in the Seattle game. Then he hurt his toe in the season opener. He appears to lack the same explosiveness, leaving him unable to break tackles, which he skillfully did last year. He admitted he's fighting frustration. Like any athlete in a slump, it's hard to have confidence without results. At this point, he should play with abandon. He has nothing to lose except more carries. \nNFL trades rarely happen. Has there been any rumors or possibilities the Broncos try to make a move? Maybe for a tight end or running back? Owen Daniels has been very underwhelming, I think we miss Julius Thomas more than expected. \n— Andrew, Littleton \nAndrew: The Broncos added a tight end on Wednesday signing Richard Gordon, a big target . The tight ends have been underwhelming. They have been unable to create separation on routes, and they have been undermined by the lack of a running game. The Kubiak offense centers on a strong ground attack that leads to play-action with wide open crossing routes to tight ends. Those plays aren't available because the Broncos can't run. I wrote repeatedly last year and in the offseason that the Broncos would miss Julius Thomas in the red zone. But he didn't fit this offense — he's not a good blocker — so there was no way they were going to pay top dollar to keep him. \nI thought Kubes was brought in to help the Broncos establish a ground game. So far it seems to be the Peyton show with the sheriff slinging the ball 40 times a game and making poor choices with the football. How can the Broncos find balance, especially when the O-line is unable to create running lanes? \n— Bryan, San Diego, Calif. \nBryan: The parts are connected. The inability to run -- a changing line with multiple left and right tackles hasn't helped -- and Manning's lack of deep ball has undermined the offense. The Broncos consistently face third-and-longs, becoming predictable. That is not the hallmark of a good offense. The Broncos don't want to throw 40 times a game, trust me. But they need to be able to run or use swing passes, anything to create more options on second and third down. It's not an easy fix. The Browns game followed by a bye offers a chance to start moving in the right direction. Kubiak has said bluntly that the Broncos need to be a \"hell of a lot better,\" pointing the finger at himself. The lack of offense has been alarming. But it's better to have this problem with a 5-0 record than a 1-4 mark. \nDenver Post Broncos writer Troy Renck posts his Broncos Mailbag on Wednesdays during the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:32:30.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
