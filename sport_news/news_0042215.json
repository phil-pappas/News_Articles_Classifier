The Royals face the Houston Astros in Game 1 of the ALDS on Thursday in Kansas City. By Kevin Haskin kevin.haskin@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — In a corner of the Kansas City Royals clubhouse sits a bottle of liniment Terrance Gore wants to keep secret in the cabinet above his locker. \nAlthough the swift outfielder plays coy, he’ll display the bottle just briefly, and even suggest Cracker Barrel as a place to possibly find the oil he uses to grease the lightning in his legs. \nYou catch a glimpse, laugh at Gore’s deception, then wonder if the stuff has an expiration date. \nNot a line stamped by the manufacturer, but by the Royals. \nThe offense possessed by Kansas City is different from a year ago, when it ended a 29-year postseason drought with pitching, defense and offensive voodoo. Back then, the Royals needed Gore on their roster to vaporize the base paths and create scoring opportunities. \nThey didn’t manufacture runs as much as they chopped, sliced and diced, attempting to avoid treadwear by advancing 90 feet at a time. \nThis year, the team possesses more pop. Enough that Gore remains an option because of his speed, but no longer the indispensable pinch-runner who became an instant cult hero a year ago. \nYet the Royals can still run. And will. \nThe 104 steals they recorded this season ranked third in the AL, yet reflected a decline of 49 in bases swiped last season. \nOtherwise, home runs (139, +44), RBIs (689, +85), runs (724, +73), batting average (.269, +.06), on-base percentage (.322, +.08) and slugging percentage (.412, +.36) all went up. The Royals still swing away too, recording the fewest strikeouts (973, good) and fewest walks (383, bad) of any AL team. \nThe gains made offensively helped the Royals overcome some shaky moments on the mound. The 4.34 ERA posted by their starters was the worst of any team to reach the postseason. \n“It’s a lot different lineup and it’s been a very solid lineup,” manager Ned Yost said. “We haven’t had to make many changes in terms of lineup construction all year long. \n“At the beginning of the year, people thought I was nuts when I put Moose in the two-hole and he had the year of his life. He’s been fantastic. We did move Moose down to the six-hole, one of the major changes we made, and put Ben Zobrist in the two-hole, which we thought was a better fit. Moose kept on being an outstanding producer in that six-hole.” \nConsistent production from Eric Hosmer and the wise acquisition of Kendrys Morales are two additional gains. The benefit of using Alcides Escobar in the leadoff hole is an anomaly no one can explain. After returning from an injury, Alex Gordon fell as far as the No. 8 spot but can still be a tough out. Also, Alex Rios improved late and should be motivated to play in the postseason for the first time. \nWith a power surge that began to surface with 11 home runs in 15 postseason games last year, the Royals pose new problems for postseason opponents. \n“That just lets you know we’ve got the home run in our back pocket,” said outfielder Jarrod Dyson, “and we’ve got speed in our back pocket. Whichever comes out, take your pick.” \nOf course, the Houston Astros can rely on a similar mix after leading the AL with 121 stolen bases and hitting 230 home runs to rank second behind Toronto (232). \nStill, the right blend of speed and stick remains a matter for Yost and general manager Dayton Moore to consider in the construction of the Royals’ ALDS roster. \nFor example, do you appoint Gore, who figures to be used exclusively as a pinch-runner? Or, do you keep Jonny Gomes, who has struggled since joining the Royals but has occasional power and postseason experience, including a brief appearance last year with the Oakland A’s? \n“When you break down weapons to win games — pitching, power, defense — all nine positions (for the Royals) are really covered, along with a deep bench to where you have a well-assembled ballclub,” Gomes said. \n“It is fair to say the offense is better, but if you look at the wild-card game last year, we hit more home runs, but we didn’t touch the plate as much as they did. That’s where it’s at.” \nBased on that description, “it” belongs to Gore, who’s always ready when a rubdown is in order. \nMixing his wheels with the bats that improved over the course of the 2015 season makes perfect sense. \n“We’ve got a lot more power in there, but we’ve still got speed,” Gore said. “I’ll play my game and if they need me, I’ll be ready. If not, I’ll be the biggest cheerleader ever.” \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:34:04.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
