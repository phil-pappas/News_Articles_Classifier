United. The top two seeds in each conference earn a first-round bye.\n\"We're trying to continue to move up the table or at least keep our spot at the No. 2 position,\" said Reds' coach Greg Vanney. \"To secure a bye would be ideal. Home-field advantage would be important for these early games so we're staying focused on the task at hand.\"\nColumbus (13-11-8) comes to Toronto well rested -- the Crew have not played since a 2-1 loss to the New York Red Bulls on Oct. 3. TFC has yet to win against Columbus this season losing 2-0 on March 14 and earning a 3-3 draw on July 27.\nAs the Reds look to extend their franchise-best four-game win streak, they're well aware of Columbus's tactics.\n\"They have a very good understanding of how they want to move off of each other and how they want to create attacks and set up attacks,\" Vanney said. \"They want you to come, open yourself up, they're very good when you get yourself spread out and not moving collectively together.\"\nSaturday's game also features a battle for the Golden Boot, which is awarded to the league's regular-season goal scoring leader. TFC's Sebastian Giovinco and the Crew's Kei Kamara are tied with 22 goals apiece. Giovinco holds the tiebreaker having recorded more assists (15).\n\"Any striker that I have on my team, that should be their ambition -- to try to lead the league in scoring,\" said Vanney. \"He deserves it in my view and I'm sure Gregg (Berhalter) thinks (Kamara) deserves it and that's totally fair. In my opinion, (Giovinco) deserves it and we want to help get him there.\"\nToronto captain Michael Bradley (groin) will be available for selection on Saturday, but defender Damien Perquis and forward Jozy Altidore will miss the game.\nPerquis suffered a hamstring injury during Wednesday's 2-1 win over the New York Red Bulls. The 31-year-old was scheduled to undergo an MRI on Friday.\nAltidore was assessed a red card in the 34th minute on Wednesday for foul and abusive language while sitting on the bench and is suspended as a result. TFC spoke with the league about having Altidore's card rescinded, but was told it can't be overturned.\n\"We've been in discussion with them, it's actually an un-appealable card, from what I understand. It's not something that they can or will overturn,\" Vanney said. \"My opinion on it is that it was incredibly soft.\"\nMidfielder Jonathan Osorio did not participate in training on Friday and is questionable for the game against Columbus. Osorio was subbed out against New York with a head injury after being hit in the ear by Herculez Gomez's free kick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:30:32.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
