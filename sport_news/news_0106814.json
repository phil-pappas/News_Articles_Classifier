Murphysboro scored seven touchdowns in the first half - five on the ground and two through the air — while taking a 49-0 lead to the lockers and guaranteeing a running clock in the second half. The lopsided victory gave the playoff bound Red Devils an overall mark of 7-1 and combined with a Harrisburg loss to Herrin, the three teams get to share the the Ohio Division of the River to River Conference title with identical 4-1 records. Murphysboro quarterback Braden Miller tossed TD passes of 18 and 6 yards in the opening quarter and Brandon Caldwell and Clay Rendleman added runs of 2 and 35 yards as the Red Devils marched out to a quick 28-0 lead. Meanwhile, Benton struggled offensively, not getting into Red Devil territory until the final play of the opening period. The Rangers also had negative yardage until until late in the second quarter. Jordan Kulich had a positive run of 18 yards on Benton's only offensive threat in the half. The Rangers got down to Murphy's 37 but ran out of time as the half ended. Benton ended the half with three yards of total rushing offense. Murphysboro out rushed the Rangers 269-117 for the game. The Rangers had to abandon the running game early after falling behind by three touchdowns with 4 1/2 minutes to go in the opening quarter. \"We just felt like we weren't going to get any movement up front offensive line wise. They're defensive line was getting off the ball, they were digging dirt and grass was flying,\" said Benton coach Jeremy Clodfelter. \"The last two weeks there was just nothing in there to get, quickness with this team and last week was more of a size factor.\" Murphysboro added three touchdowns in the second quarter to pad its lead. Connor Graff scored on reverse runs of 15 and 49 yards and Rindleman clicked off a 47-yard TD, after receiving a nice block near the goal line by teammate Aaron Wyatt. Cole Richardson scored on a nice 45-yard run after catching a pass from quarterback Caleb Rock in the flat with just under four minutes to play in the third quarter and Kulich lunged into the end zone following an 8-yard run with 4:50 to go in the game. Miller was a perfect 5-of-5 for 51 yards and two touchdowns. Rock was 10-of-18 for 100 yards. Rendleman led all rushers with 125 yards. Benton played without the services of sophomore quarterback Hamilton Page and tight end Marc Torres — both players injured in last week's loss to Massac County. Seniors Chase Owens and center Tyler Ore were also \"banged up,\" according to Clodfelter. He called their return for next week \"day to day.\" Page 2 of 2 - \"Some times you go through seasons like this when it's not working out, it's not going to end how you obviously would like for it to. It's easy to hang your hat and not get revved up to play and when you have to play a team of this caliber, it's cyclical and nobody likes to go through that. There's been nights we've come over here and beat Murphy like that,\" Clodfelter said. \"Right now, it's no fun and you just have to continue to keep going through it.\" Benton's season will come to a close next Friday night as they travel to Anna-Jonesboro. The Rangers dropped to 1-4 in the conference and 2-6 overall.
