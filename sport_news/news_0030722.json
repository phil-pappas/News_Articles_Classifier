(G.G. Rigsby/Effingham Now). Back | Next Bug is a dog that is available for adoption from the Effingham County animal shelter. (G.G. Rigsby/Effingham Now). By G.G. Rigsby The Effingham County animal shelter has six finches that are available for adoption this week.\nA woman who said she couldn’t care for the birds any longer brought 28 birds to the shelter last week.\nShelter Director Lorna Shelton said 22 of the birds were adopted right away and the six finches remain.\nThey can be adopted for $25 and they come with their own cage.\n“They have a soft coo, not loud or crazy,” she said. “They can be sensitive to extreme temperature changes.”\nAlso up for adoption this week is a 1-year-old dog named Bug that likes toys. He was adopted but was returned because he has high energy and had separation anxiety.\nShelton said the dog may be a mix of Boston Terrier and Beagle. “He has a lot of personality.”\nThe fee to adopt animals from the Effingham shelter is $50 for dogs and $40 for cats, which includes shots.\nPeople who adopt animals from the shelter must agree to have them spayed or neutered within 30 days, or be subject to a $200 fine. The shelter is following up to make sure that people abide by the law.\nAnimals must receive a rabies and a “DAPP” shot — for distemper, adenovirus, parainfluenza and parvovirus.\nSomeone who adopts can take the animal home but must agree to bring the animal back on a Monday or Thursday to get its shots.\nThe shelter’s phone number is 912-754-2109. It is open for adoptions Mondays and Thursdays from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nThe office hours, when the shelter accepts drop-offs, are 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.\nThe address for the shelter’s adoption page is:\nhttp://www.effinghamcounty.org/DepartmentsAF/AnimalShelter/AdoptionPage.aspx", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://www.effinghamcounty.org/DepartmentsAF/AnimalShelter/AdoptionPage.aspx", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14778325.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14778324.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14778324.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14778325.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:44:47.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
