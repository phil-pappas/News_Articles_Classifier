The trio were charged for orchestrating deliberate no-balls in return for money in the Lord's Test against England. They were also jailed by a UK court.\nPlaying for Sui Southern Gas Corporation in the qualifying round (a non first class match), Amir finished with 7-61 to complete a ten-wicket haul in the match against State Bank of Pakistan.\nThat took his tally to 17 wickets in two matches after he finished with seven in the first game. \"I am enjoying my bowling and am satisfied with my progress,\" Amir said from Multan by phone.\n\"I am feeling better day by day.\" Amir said he was very much focused on domestic matches and was not thinking of returning to international game soon.\n\"My focus is on domestic matches and I want my team to qualify for the main rounds,\" said Amir, whose team will qualify for the main rounds of Quaid-e-Azam Trophy — Pakistan's premier first-class tournament — if it wins the next game starting in two days.\n\"International cricket is not on my mind yet and once I attain that full rhythm then only I will make my future plans,\" said Amir.\nAmir was regarded as the \"hottest property\" in the game at the time of his ban by none other than the legendary Pakistan paceman Imran Khan.\nPCB earlier this month said all three players have to complete a comprehensive rehabilitation program before getting closer to selection in the national team.\nThe program includes social and charity work and lectures to young players on how to avoid the pitfalls of corruption in cricket. Amir will visit a SOS village in Multan and will play cricket with young children Saturday. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:31:28.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
