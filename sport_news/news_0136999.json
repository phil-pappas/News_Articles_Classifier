(AP) — The Houston Astros beat the Kansas City Royals at their own game Thursday night, relying on sharp pitching from Collin McHugh and stingy defense behind him for a 5-2 victory in the opener of their AL Division Series. \nMcHugh (1-0) allowed four hits, including a pair of solo homers by Kendrys Morales, while pitching around a 49-minute rain delay. The right-hander lasted six innings before turning the game over to his bullpen, which scattered just three runners over the final three frames. \nTony Sipp, Will Harris and Oliver Perez got the game to Luke Gregerson, part of Oakland’s wild-card collapse in Kansas City last year. He handled the ninth to earn the save. \nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros. \nRangers 5, Blue Jays 3 \nTORONTO — Robinson Chirinos hit a two-run homer against David Price, Rougned Odor had a solo shot and the Texas Rangers beat the Blue Jays 5-3 Thursday in an AL Division Series opener as postseason baseball returned to Toronto for the first time in 22 years. \nYovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:44:47.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
