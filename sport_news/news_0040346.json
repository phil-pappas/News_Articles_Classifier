Raegan Huhn had two hits and two RBI and Erin Eichholz recorded two hits. \nMacy Berhorst earned the win in the circle, recording eight strikeouts while allowing four hits. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:44:11.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
