After a timeout, Joe Harris received the ball on a sideline out-of-bounds play and couldn't get a shot off.\nCleveland (0-2) held a lead of 19 in the third quarter. Head coach David Blatt played a lineup down the stretch that featured mostly camp invites, which allowed the Sixers to inch back in the game.\nWhen their Cavaliers received a copy of their preseason schedule and saw that six of their seven games were part of back-to-back sets; they knew they would be sitting their main guys at times. That was the case on Thursday night. LeBron James, J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov were held out after playing the night before in Cincinnati.\nSidelining those key contributors is a function of the team's \"Body Maintenance and Management Program.\" Far more important than wins is entering the regular season as close to ailment-free as possible.\n\"Who made that decision?\" coach David Blatt said of the exhibition schedule.\nHe went with a starting lineup of Mo Williams, Matthew Dellavedova, Richard Jefferson, James Jones and Sasha Kaun. The Cavaliers spent the evening experimenting and providing minutes to players trying to make the team and dominated until the final moments.\nThere are five more games, but roster hopeful Jared Cunningham is creating some distance from the other camp invites. He scored a game-high 31 points on 8-of-18 shooting, with 21 points in the first half. The 6-3 guard is averaging 20.5 points in two games.\nMidway in the fourth quarter he used a pick at the top of the key to accelerate to the basket for a one-handed slam in traffic. It was his night.\nAnderson Varejao was a game-time decision entering the game. Recovering from an Achilles tear, the veteran big man didn't look sluggish at all. Indeed, he was the most energetic player on the court when he played.\nHe came off the bench and torched the Sixers' frontcourt with a variety of up-and-under moves and a steady dose of knocking down midrange shots off pick-and-pop action. He only played in the first quarter, but had 10 points on 5-of-7 shooting to pair with three rebounds in six minutes.\nDellavedova registered 13 points, four rebounds and five assists.\nThe condensed exhibition schedule puts the Cavaliers at a disadvantage. Their players need the work and game repetition, but putting them out on the floor too much is dangerous.\n\"In an ideal world, it would be nice to have a game and a practice day or two and maybe a day's rest,\" Blatt said. \"Having the back-to-backs, so many of them in a short period of time in the preparation period; it's not the optimal training procedure for us.\"\nFor the Sixers, marquee opponents taking the night off are routine. It just doesn't happen often in the second preseason game.\nJerami Grant led Philadelphia (1-1) with 19 points and No. 3 overall pick Jahlil Okafor struggled, going 4-of-12 for 12 points. Nerlens Noel supplied 10 points and a game-high 15 rebounds.\nOn Monday the Cavaliers face Memphis in Columbus. The team expects all of their healthy players to suit up. They could even get an extra boost if Kevin Love is cleared to play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:20:41.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
