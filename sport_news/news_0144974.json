From Big Ten power Ohio State to MAC member Toledo , the squads who have vanquished everything in their path so far will be tested between now and the end of the season. Which stands the best chance of reaching the finish line with an unblemished record? SI.comâ€™s college football writers make their picks: Andy Staples: Ohio State\nI'm not sure anyone will finish undefeated, but right now I'd still have to guess Ohio State. The Buckeyes have so much talent. If they do eventually put it all together, they can roll through the remainder of their schedule. Pete Thamel: Houston or Toledo\nMy best guesses at an undefeated team are either Houston or Toledo. They are the best remaining undefeated teams in the American and MAC. I don't see any major conference teams going undefeated. All of them are too flawed.\nBrian Hamilton: Clemson This seems less an issue of who's good enough and more an issue of how feeble the other teams on the schedule are. That's a problem for any of the unbeatens in the Pac-12 and Big 12. And, to some extent, the Big Ten, given the collision courses that Ohio State, Michigan , Michigan State , Northwestern and Iowa are all on. Which brings us to the ACC and AAC, and Clemson and Houston.\nThe Cougars get Memphis , Cincinnati and Vanderbilt at home with no terrifically formidable road games left. Tom Herman's crew can control games, ranking seventh nationally with 305.8 rushing yards per game. The Tigers, meanwhile, have two medium tests (at Miami and at N.C. State) and one major test ( Florida State ), and the Seminoles visit Death Valley. Clemson also has a top 25 defense that makes impact plays (third nationally with 9.3 tackles for loss per game) and gets off the field (fifth nationally in allowing just a 22.4% conversion rate on third down). Dabo Swinney may not coach the most prolific, least erratic team in the country, but it looks like he has enough talent and defensive reliability to navigate the cleanest path to 12-0.\nBen Glicksman: Ohio State\nCollege Football Video Clemson up, Ohio St. down in college football Power Rankings after Week 5 by Colin Becht", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:13:50.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
