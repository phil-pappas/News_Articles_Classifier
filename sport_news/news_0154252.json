Game: Lassiter (2-3, 0-3) at Woodstock (3-2, 1-2), 7:30 p.m.Last year: Woodstock 51, Lassiter 42All-time series: Lassiter leads 8-5Prediction: Woodstock 24, Lassiter 20Woodstock and Lassiter might be in for a lower-scoring game than those might expect when they meet at the Wolverine Den tonight.After combining for 93 points in last season’s game, the Region 5 teams are both facing obstacles on offense.Woodstock quarterback Garrett Bass, Cherokee County’s leading passer, will be out after suffering an ankle injury against Etowah two weeks ago, but coach Brent Budde does not plan on limiting his play-calls with junior Liam Byrne in the game.“The confidence in Liam is very high,” Budde said, “We’ve gotten him game reps, and he’s a very talented quarterback. There wasn’t much separating him from being the starter. I feel like I have my starting quarterback in there. That’s the level of confidence we have in Liam.”Coming off a bye, Lassiter (2-3, 0-3) had an extra week to prepare for Woodstock (3-2, 1-2), which Irwin used to clean up mistakes that have hurt the Trojans.“We practiced two days and we gave them the rest of the week off,” he said. “We saw the film of the Milton game and just talked about having the discipline to execute over the course of a drive for multiple plays in a row offensively.”A factor working in Lassiter’s favor may be desperation. After starting 0-3 in the region, Irwin said his players are well aware of the task the Trojans face to make the state playoffs.“They know what our record is,” he said. “We haven’t really talked about it. We just talk about what we need to do to play our best game of the season this week. They know what our record is. We’re really focused on getting this win this week, getting back on a winning track and playing winning football.”Game: Etowah (4-1, 2-1) at Pope (0-4, 0-2)Last year: Etowah 35, Pope 20All-time series: Series tied 8-8Prediction: Etowah 49, Pope 14Pope will get another shot at its first win when it hosts Etowah tonight.Although the Greyhounds have struggled to find success this season, coach Kyle Adkins said he is pleased with his team’s attitude, and he thinks the breakthrough is not far away.“We haven’t wavered one bit,” he said. “I’ve been real surprised. I think that’s a tribute to the job our coaching staff has been doing. Kids are staying focused, and they want to win. It’s cliché to say we’re teaching them how to win, but there are a lot of processes with the new staff coming in this year to basically teach them everything.”If Pope is to win tonight, it will have to find a way to stop an Etowah rushing attack led by Tyray Devezin and Trey Moore. The duo has rushed for a combined 948 yards and 11 touchdowns for the Eagles.Because Etowah’s offense is so different from his own, Adkins said it has been difficult to prepare, but he thinks the differences can create an advantage for Pope’s offense.“I think it’s a little bit of a double-edged sword,” Adkins said. “It’s tough for us to simulate what they do, but, in the same breath, when you do stuff like that offensively, and you try to get ready for somebody like us, it makes it difficult on them, too. I think it all works itself out.”Despite the slow start to the season, Adkins said he is still approaching the remainder of his schedule one game at a time, but once the Greyhounds do get their first win, he thinks more good things will follow.“I think the main thing would be that the kids would finally see that this is why we’ve been doing what we’re doing,” Adkins said. “I think, when all of it finally comes together, we’re going to be a pretty good football team. It’s just a question of when that’s going to happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:41:07.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
