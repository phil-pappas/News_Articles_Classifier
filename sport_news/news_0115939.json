Williams wanted to wear pink shoes or wristbands through the season, he recently told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler , but was told by NFL VP of Football Operations Troy Vincent that the league’s uniform policy is unmovable.\nThe story didn't gain traction until ESPN's Lisa Salters mentioned it during the telecast of Pittsburgh's thrilling last-second win over the Chargers on Monday Night Football , and Williams responded to it after.\n“The same way it made you feel after you heard it—like, man,” he told Fowler. “[Vincent] told me no. I'm assuming they are telling everybody else no as well. ... It wasn't about selling it. You know and I know and everybody else knows before I made the phone call.”\nNFL Video NFL Power Rankings Week 6: Cardinals and Vikings on the upswing by Chris Burke", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/SI_DougFarrar", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13879055/deangelo-williams-pittsburgh-steelers-says-nfl-nixed-pink-plans-due-uniform-policy"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:37:02.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
