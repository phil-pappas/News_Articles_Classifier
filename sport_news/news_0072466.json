(AP) - A top University of New Mexico official says a federal scorecard that says the school’s graduates earn thousands of dollars less than their peers from other colleges is unfair. \nThe Albuquerque Journal reported (http://bit.ly/1j8B7QO) Sunday that Provost Chaouki Abdallah is criticizing the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard. \nAccording to the study, UNM students who enrolled and obtained financial aid make $5,000 less than the national median for students. \nThe scorecard says the median salary for the typical four-year college student 10 years after they first registered was $40,500. \nUNM’s median student earning was $35,900. \nAbdullah says the findings are off because they include salaries of students at satellite campuses, which are two-year programs in rural areas. \nThe scorecard calculates median salaries for students from more than 7,000 campuses. \n___ \nInformation from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:09:07.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
