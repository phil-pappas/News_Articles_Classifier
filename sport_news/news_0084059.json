Thanks to a team of vets and volunteers they're making great progress.\nTwo of the kittens have already gone to their new homes. A third is waiting for clearance from the vet before going to his new home and the other three will soon be up for adoption.\nWhen you see the four brothers in action, it's hard to believe they all underwent major surgery not long ago. Several Good Samaritans found the kittens in Wauseon and called Planned Pethood. The rescue group immediately got them to St. Francis Veterinary Hospital in Sylvania for the help they needed. Dr, John Dillon checked on the kittens today, \"They're all coming along pretty well.\"\nIt was a much different story when they were first brought in. The kittens all had severe upper respiratory disease, they were covered in fleas and four of them had a ruptured eye that had to be removed.\nIn the days since their surgeries, they've made remarkable progress.But Dr. Dillon says a couple of them still need a little more care, \"Two of them still need more time in the healing process, they need to continue with anti-biotics. In another couple weeks they should be on the mend.\"\nWhen it comes to losing an eye, \"It doesn't seem to be slowing them down whatsoever, which is good . They are gaining weight, they are eating well it's just a matter of giving them more time and more care.\"\nHarry Dewitz and his wife have been taking care of the kittens. They say the little bundles of energy have brought a lot of smiles to their faces, \"They all have nice personalities. They are very active, they mix well with the adult cats we have, they've been a lot of fun!\"\nAs for volunteers of Planned Pethood like Pam Parquette, this story is a great example of their mission.\"To look into their eyes and know you've helped make them healthy again is the best reward ever.\"\nOnce again, two of the kittens are already in their new homes. A third was cleared for adoption today. The other three are going back to the vet for a check up next week and they will be ready to go to their new homes as soon as they get a clean bill of health.", "external_links": ["http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C50/02A/C5002ACDEF1C444C8486856EC7F387E2.mp4", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/small+kittens.jpg", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/small+kittens.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:04:59.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
