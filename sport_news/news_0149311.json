He was never on the disabled list, aided in part by the organization’s decision to make him strictly a designated hitter. \n\"I certainly didn’t think in spring training I would post up over 150 [games]. I’m grateful for that. I’m grateful for the opportunity,\" A-Rod said. As a team, \"We accomplished a lot of good things … we came up a little short, but I also think we’re going to be good for a long time.\" \nRodriguez, who has two years remaining on his contract, also felt that \"the team just hit a wall, collectively\" in the final six weeks. \"And that’s rare because usually some guys get hot, some guys get cold. It seemed like all of us hit the wall at the same time. There’s no excuses.\" \nGeneral manager Brian Cashman said that A-Rod’s performance was the most unanticipated result from among his players. \n\"I don’t know if anybody would have honestly been able to plan for [his production],\" Cashman said. \"We hope and expect that to continue as we go forward.\" \nFIRST THINGS: Cashman does not foresee rookie first baseman Greg Bird playing any other position next year, \"so that would create a problem\" with a healthy Mark Teixeira (fractured right leg) due back in spring training. Bird batted .261 with 11 homers and 31 RBI in 46 games as Teixeira’s replacement, but for now he’s ticketed to begin 2016 at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
