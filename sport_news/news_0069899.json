The Galaxy's roster currently includes Ireland National Team captain Robbie Keane , former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and Mexican National Team star Giovani dos Santos .\nOther big-market clubs in MLS have followed suit, taking advantage of the designated player rule and the recent addition of targeted allocation money , to sign big-name players, whose hefty price tags far exceed the salary cap.\nThough traditionally many big-name stars coming to MLS have been at the end of their careers, it hasn't stopped some from making an immediate impact. Since joining the Montreal Impact in July, Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba has scored nine goals in nine games.\nBut whether MLS is heading in a direction where successful teams will have to have established, big-name stars remains to be seen.\nNot every club that has prioritized going after big-name players has triumphed.\nSince joining MLS in 2007, Toronto FC has failed to make a postseason appearance. The club finished seventh in the Eastern Conference in 2014, despite boasting star players Michael Bradley and Jermain Defoe.\nThis year, behind a multi-million dollar lineup that includes Sebastian Giovinco, Jozy Altidore and Bradley, Toronto has clinched a playoff berth â€“ though they've been far from dominant in a weak Eastern Conference.\nPlenty of MLS teams have found success without big-name players as well. Many clubs in mid-sized markets have instead used their designated player slots to bring in top international talent that might not carry the same name recognition, but can still be effective and valuable additions in the league.\n\"If you look across the league, you can point to smaller markets that have to look at their business differently, but are still successful,\" Klein said. \"Portland, Salt Lake, Columbus, they have markets where having good teams will carry the day. The atmosphere in Portland isn't predicated on having a Giovani Dos Santos or a Steven Gerrard.\"\nThe Portland Timbers , who are currently just above the red line in sixth place in the Western Conference, have made a point of going after players that fit their in-depth positional profiles and performance indicators, rather than focusing on name recognition.\nGeneral Manager Gavin Wilkinson pointed to the marquee signings of Diego Valeri and Diego Chara as examples of how the club has approached bringing in talent to fit Portland's system.\nSince signing with the Timbers in 2013, Valeri has developed into a top MLS player, leading Portland's attack and finishing near the top of the league in assists in each of his first two seasons. Chara has anchored Portland's central midfield since 2011.\nTwo of Portland's more recent designated player signings, Fanendo Adi and Liam Ridgewell , have both performed well, but aren't considered stars in MLS.\nAnd in July, the Timbers added another designated player in Lucas Melano , who has shown potential and a knack for creating scoring chances, but has recorded just one goal and is clearly still adjusting to MLS. Melano hasn't made the same immediate impact that some bigger-name summer acquisitions have made, like Drogba, who has led Montreal to a 5-1-1 record in his seven starts, or Dos Santos, who has three goals and four assists in eight games.\n\"The player has to want to be in Portland and the player has to fit into what we expect out of that position,\" Wilkinson said. \"We don't want players whose best years are behind them. We want them to be motivated. We want them to be ambitious. We want them to succeed for this organization.\"\nOther mid-market teams have followed similar strategies to the Timbers.\nReal Salt Lake, who is fighting for a playoff spot this year, earned seven straight playoff berths from 2008-2014 and won the MLS Cup in 2009 with a core group of consistent players.\nAnd FC Dallas and the Vancouver Whitecaps have become two of the top teams in MLS this season by supplementing their rosters with experienced and talented players from abroad, rather than going after big names.\n\"I think our clubs have different approaches in the way they want to build their rosters,\" MLS Executive Vice President of Player Relations and Competition Todd Durbin said. \"The primary driver for these teams will always be, 'What can we do to put the best team on the field?'\"\nBut as more and more big-name stars turn to MLS , including a few expensive players in their prime, like dos Santos and Giovinco, big market teams in large, internationally known cities will continue to have an advantage.\n\"Some players want big-city markets,\" Wilkinson said. \"They want an international airport that can access every hub around the world. They want to be in those cities.\"\nMLS Commissioner Don Garber has continued to characterize parity as a \"core tenet\" of MLS.\nThe league points to its single-entity structure and salary cap as keys to maintaining parity. MLS also believes that through mechanisms, like the designated player rule and targeted allocation money, every team has the ability to bring in top players and compete for MLS Cups.\n\"We want teams to have equal competitive opportunities,\" Durbin said. \"Our goal is to give teams the ability to build and tailor their rosters in a way that is autonomous.\"\nBut as the price tags for top, big-name players continue to skyrocket and the same cluster of big-budget clubs continue to end up with the biggest stars, the league's ability to maintain parity will be tested.\nWhile there continues to be varied ways to approach player acquisitions, teams like the Galaxy, who have benefited from their market, a wealthy ownership group, and a robust local TV deal , have certainly found a recipe for consistent success.\n\"The dynamics of each team are different,\" Klein said. \"I think teams having their own identity is essential to the success of this league. Not every team will do it the way we do it.\"\n-- Jamie Goldberg | jgoldberg@oregonian.com\n503-853-3761 | @ jamiebgoldberg", "external_links": ["http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/MLS-commissioner-Don-Garber-holds-forth-on-Landon-Donovan-Frank-Lampard-and-other-matters.html", "https://twitter.com/Jamiebgoldberg", "http://www.lagalaxy.com/post/2015/03/09/la-galaxy-announce-local-broadcast-schedule-and-talent-2015-season"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:19:22.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
