There was booing and a \"Fire Golden\" chant from the sparse crowd even before the first quarter ended, and the stands were largely empty by the midpoint of the third quarter as Clemson defeated Miami 58-0. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Miami fans chanting in the stands at Sun Life Stadium (or leaving early), and those flying planes with the same sentiments, have Clemson to thank for granting their wish. A day after No. 3 Clemson drubbed Miami 58-0, the Hurricanes’ athletic department fired Al Golden at midseason in his fifth year leading the U. Golden finished 32-25, and 17-18 in ACC play, with a 2-9 record against ranked opponents. “We got beat from top to bottom,” Golden said after the loss. “I told the team that it’s my responsibility for not getting the team ready.” Golden’s counterpart, Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney, has won 35 consecutive games against unranked opponents, but after the game Saturday (and about 24 hours before Golden was relieved of his duties), he expressed sympathy from one coach to another for Golden’s plight. “I know it ain’t far from the outhouse to the penthouse, that’s what I know,” Swinney said. “I don’t celebrate anything from Miami’s bad day. I feel for ‘em. I hate it, man. Al Golden is a great guy. Really have a lot of a respect for him. I have respect for this university.” Swinney is on top right now, leading a team that has the fourth-best winning percentage in college football since the start of 2012 – and the three teams in front have won the last three national championships. But Swinney remembers when times weren’t to terrific at Clemson, and when he was fired along with Alabama’s entire staff in 2011. “When you’re in competition long enough, sometimes you’re the bug and sometimes you’re the windshield. That’s the ol’ saying,” Swinney said. “It’s just a bad day for ‘em. I’ve been on the other side of it, and it’s just bad. It stinks. “But I told some of their players coming off the field, don’t let this game define you. Go win next week. Stay focused on what you control, and finish strong.” Miami (4-3) plays at No. 22 Duke this weekend. The Hurricanes lost starting quarterback Brad Kaaya to concussion symptoms following a sack by Clemson defensive end Shaq Lawson, and became the seventh FBS team to sack its head coach since the season began. “This was a bad day for them, obviously, and a great day for Clemson,” Swinney said. “But my heart breaks for him a little bit, because I’ve been there. Obviously, I’m a competitor and I want to win as bad as I possibly can, but they are people over there. This is what you do for a living and a livelihood. You’ve got a wife and kids.” Although he admitted he hadn’t concerned the coincidence, Swinney acknowledged one of his previous trips to Sun Life Stadium – when Clemson, the 2011 ACC Champion, was run off the field 70-33 by West Virginia in the 2012 Orange Bowl, leading Swinney to fire defensive coordinator Kevin Steele and bring in Brent Venables from Oklahoma. “I’ve been on the other side of that. If you stay in this thing long enough, you’ll be on it again,” Swinney said. “I understand that. But today was our day and I’m very thankful for that.” Central Florida also announced Sunday George O’Leary, whose team beat Baylor in the Fiesta Bowl two years ago, is resigning. Other FBS openings include South Carolina, Southern Cal, Illinois, Maryland and North Texas.
