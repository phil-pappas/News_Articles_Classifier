He had been a scout in the organization for more than 40 years after his playing career ended when he lost his leg in a home heater explosion.\nKoney was once considered the heir to Hall of Famer Bobby Doerr at second base. He batted .277 in the minor leagues. But he was visiting his native Chicago when a hot water tank exploded in the basement of his parents' house. His injuries cost him his right leg.\nRed Sox owner Tom Yawkey offered Koney a lifetime job with the team. He spent the next 42 years as a scout, at one time visiting Carl Yastrzemski at Notre Dame and hitting fly balls to the future Hall of Famer.\nHis last year as a scout was in 1992. He remained with the Red Sox as a consultant.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
