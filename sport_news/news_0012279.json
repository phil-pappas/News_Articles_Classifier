Quarterback Travis Wilson came back to reality last week after lighting up Oregon, throwing two picks to only one touchdown against Cal. The Golden Bears' defensive coverages seemed to befuddle Wilson, who hit Cory Butler-Byrd for a long 54-yard touchdown, but generated only 116 yards otherwise. He has a good matchup this week against an ASU pass defense that ranks 10th in the Pac-12 and 90th in the nation in passing yards allowed. However, he'll also deal with an ASU team that's aggressive and blitzes almost incessantly, making ball security and decision making a high priority. Mike Bercovici came into the season heralded as an upgrade under center from the departed Taylor Kelly, but struggled out of the gate against Texas A&M. After the Sun Devils were embarrassed by USC, Bercovici has caught fire the last two weeks, throwing for a combined seven touchdowns to two interceptions and 533 yards against Colorado and UCLA. Utah will need to take a page out of A&M's book, hitting him early and often with sacks and pressure to keep him off kilter. Still, ASU boasts the fourth best passing offense and fourth most passing touchdowns in the Pac-12, giving Bercovici the edge here. Edge: ASU Running back It's easy to discount just how good Devontae Booker is when he performs week after week, but his 222 yard effort against Cal was his third 100 yard day out of five games this season. He's averaging 133 yards per game and leads the Utes in receiving with 194 yards in the Pac-12's third best rushing offense. However, he's also running up against the conference's fourth best rush defense this week in ASU, that held UCLA star Paul Perkins to only 63 yards two weeks ago. The Utes will have to vary up Booker's usage to not only pound him between the tackles, but aslo get him the ball in space on swing passes and dump offs, to beat the Sun Devils. The biggest injury question in this game depends on sophomore running back Demario Richard's knee and how effective he can be on Saturday. Richard has keyed the resurgence of ASU's offense after some struggles to begin the season, racking up 529 yards and four scores this year. ASU has other options in the versatile D.J. Foster and speedster Kalen Ballage, but Richard is the straw that stirs the drink. With his potential to be hobbled, Booker has the clear advantage.
