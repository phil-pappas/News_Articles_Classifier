(Rich Pedroncelli / AP) Ira Winderman Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Chris Bosh goes back to the future when assessing LaMarcus Aldridge's free-agency shift \nThere was a moment this summer when Pat Riley apparently thought two Chris Boshes were better than one. So despite lacking the required cap space, the Miami Heat president nonetheless sat down with LaMarcus Aldridge, another lithe, outside-shooting power forward, during free agency. \nEventually, the seduction of championship potential and a boatload of cap cash swayed the former Portland Trail Blazers All-Star to the San Antonio Spurs. \nThat had Aldridge at AmericanAirlines Arena for Monday's exhibition against the Heat, and had Bosh talking about their common transition from standalone perimeter power forward to ensemble component. \n\"The transition is the hardest part,\" said Bosh, who had to remake his game when he joined LeBron James and Dwyane Wade with the Heat in the 2010 offseason. \"Especially with him, he was getting a high volume amount of touches. Frankly, it's a lot easier to be a team guy then. But now you have to play within the offense and then people are telling you to be aggressive and you don't know how to do that. It's going to be a continuous thing. And usually when you figure it out, the season's over. \n\"At least that's how it was for me. I'm sure in that organization, they're going to try to fast-track him along. But when you're playing with all that talent, with all those expectations, you got people chirping at you what you should be doing and you know what you need to be doing within the organization, it's tough.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:00:26.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
