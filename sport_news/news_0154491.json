But despite a considerably better outing from Corning, Elmira rallied from an early two-goal deficit to post a 3-2 victory over the Hawks at Memorial Stadium. Kendra Oldroyd scored two goals to lead the Express -- including what proved to be the game-winner with 4:18 remaining in the second half. Jalasia Demember netted the tying goal off an assist from Meredith Fennell early in the second half. When the two rivals met on Sept. 8, Elmira scored four times in the opening 10 minutes en route to a 6-0 win. The Hawks were much better and better prepared this time around. “I couldn’t have been more pleased with their fight -- I didn’t want them to play scared and I think they have some confidence moving forward,” Corning head coach Julie Pierce said. Hailey Bicknell scored two goals in the first half to help Corning open up a 2-0 lead. Bicknell opened the scoring with a goal at the 24:13 mark of the first half as she scored into the far right corner from the left side of the goal box. Bicknell’s second goal was arguably more impressive. Playing at midfield, Bicknell freed herself just enough from her defender to unleash a 30-yard rocket that sailed over the Elmira keeper’s outstretched arms. “I was really proud,” Pierce said. “We’ve been working really hard and they’re a great team. Kendra’s a really savvy goal scorer and she’s light’s out fast. We executed out our game plan and it’s a game of inches.” Corning (6-4) will host Binghamton at 7 p.m. Tuesday.
