Amid various agitations and onslaught by the opposition BJP, which has been making all efforts to oust the government, Rawat has been trying hard to be one step ahead of his opponents. In the past three months, the Congress government has faced incessant attack from the BJP on various issues. The disaster relief fund scam and the sting CD in which Rawat’s personal secretary Mohammad Shahid was purportedly bargaining with middlemen and private liquor distributors gave enough fuel to the BJP to hit the Congress government. However, undeterred, Rawat has been acting smart and quick to start various welfare schemes and even inventing his own ideas to counter various welfare schemes launched by the Centre. To counter the RSS and BJP plans to celebrate “Harela” festival in August in a big way to get in touch with the people at the ground level, Rawat made it a state government programme. He has been trying to create an image of a Chief Minister who is caring about the poor and those living in the remote hilly areas of the state. He has come up with plantation programmes in which villagers would be paid for upkeep of trees. He came up with “Gau, Ganga Mahila Dairy yojna” by providing cows to 500 poor women in each district of the state to provide economic sustenance to poor and widowed women. His initiative to start “Indira Amma” canteens where a thali is provided for Rs 20 in Dehradun on experimental basis has become an instant hit. Two more such canteens would be set up in Dehradun and plans are afoot to start these to provide cheap quality food in all districts of the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:16:38.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
