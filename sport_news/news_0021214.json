In my opinion, play like it's 0-0 the whole game,\" she said. \nTroutman drove into the Warwick striking circle and as Warrior defenders collapsed on her, reversed her stick and deftly knocked the ball home for the final score of the 3-2 Black Knights' victory. \nThe win helped Hempfield improve to 11-3 in the league, and 13-5 overall as the Knights secured second place in Section One, behind champ Penn Manor. \nIn contrast to the wide-open first half, the second was played much tighter, although Warwick (5-9, 5-13) had its chances. \nWith 2:30 remaining, Hempfield goalkeeper Hollyn Barr had to come out and kick away a Warriors effort at the tying goal. \nWarwick also got a pair of penalty corners after time expired. The first attempt led to a second corner, however that effort was swept away to avoid overtime and preserve the Knights' win. \n\"I think we were a little more disciplined in the second half,\" Hempfield coach Julianne Bojanic-Collier. \"Our focus was to communicate more.\" \nTroutman got the scoring started a little more than 11 minutes into the game when she pounced on a rebound and slid it home after Warwick keeper Megan Bombo saved the first shot. \nA minute and a half later, the Warriors answered on a rebound of their own when Madalyn Christen knotted the score at 1-1. \nTaylor Nolan gave the Knights the lead back with 15:49 left in the half, but a short while later, Hannah Bollinger drove to her right and blasted a shot high over Barr into the cage, deadlocking the game at 2-2. \nTurning point: Warwick looked to tie the game, but as the high shot was heading towards the goal, it hit a Hempfield player in the circle, resulting in a penalty stroke being awarded with 21:59 left to play. \nChristen ripped the ensuing hard shot low, only to be robbed by the out-stretched stick of a diving Barr, whose game-saving stop came as no surprise to Troutman. \n\"We've seen Hollyn enough to know she would make that save,\" Troutman said.
