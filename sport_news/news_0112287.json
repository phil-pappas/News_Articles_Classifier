So what could have been a two-run double turned into the inning’s first out. Matz recovered to get Kyle Schwarber on a grounder to first. It allowed Soler to score, but the Mets gladly took the second out.\n“That fourth inning, to have the bases loaded and nobody out, all you try to do is limit the damage,” Matz said. “David made a great play. I tried to get a fastball in and before I even knew what happened, it was in David’s glove.”\nWright barely had time to react.\n“It felt like a double, but I was in the right spot,” Wright said.\nWilmer Flores followed by making a nice running catch in foul territory on a pop-up by Javier Baez to end the threat.\nModal Trigger Mets' Steven Matz: Thanks for the cushion Posted: October 22, 2015 View Thumbnails Previous Next Advertisement David Wright waves to the crowd after Game 4 of the NLCS.
