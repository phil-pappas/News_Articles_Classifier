Photo courtesy of Donald Scott After a week of suspensions and turmoil, the Durango High School boys cross country team banded together to win the Ancient Trails 5K in Cortez. A fter a week the Durango High School cross country team would like to forget, the Demons laced up their running shoes and were back on the trail Saturday at the Montezuma County Fairgrounds for the Ancient Trails 5K race. In the first competition following the suspension of seven runners for alcohol and marijuana use on last week’s team trip to Arizona, the Demons did what they’ve done all year – they outran the opposition. “Stronger after a week of heartache and self-reflection, the Durango squad, resplendent in red, rose up to the challenge,” Durango head coach David McMillan wrote in an email to The Durango Herald. “Just like the Phoenix rises in the Harry Potter books, we too will we rise from the ashes - of Phoenix.” Durango senior and No. 1 runner Benjamin Lachelt didn’t participate in this race, but fellow senior Nicholas Turco picked up the slack in a big way. Turco handled the added pressure like a veteran and won the race with a time of 17 minutes, 24 seconds – 33 seconds faster than second-place Devin Howe of Red Valley-Cove. William Chandler’s run of 18:01 was good for third place. David Moenning was eighth in 18:42; Seamus Millett finished 10th in 18:43; and Finn Hopkins came in 20th in 20:13, as the Demons finished first as a team. The Durango girls team finished in a first-place tie with Farmington but prevailed in a sixth-runner tiebreak. Freshman Becca Moenning (23:08) led the pack for the Demons, crossing the line in fourth place while another freshman, Anna Smagacz, followed up four seconds later at 23:12 and took fifth. Abby Scott’s 24:06 was good enough for 11th, Marit May finished in 14th (24:37) and Sarah Smagacz 15th (24:46). Julia Peterson’s 17th place finish (24:56) was the one that made the difference in the tiebreaker, as she finished ahead of Farmington’s sixth to clinch the win for the Demons. “The sidelines swarmed with Durango red during the races and excited voices bounced off the sandstone ledges lining the race course,” McMillan wrote. “Joy lifted the veil of sadness and a feeling of a job well done, both at the races and during innumerable team meetings this week, settled on the squad. More work ahead, for sure, but a healthy journey begun.” Bayfield High School The Wolverines’ boys finished in eighth place as a team at the Ancient Trails race. Sloan Mazur’s time of 20:05 led the Bayfield squad and was good enough for an 18th-place finish. Bryan Gram finished 28th (20:59), Brandon Stuever came in 41st (22:03), Jackson Sibley was 50th (23:43) and Daniel Jenkins finished 60th (25:22) to round out the scoring for the Wolverines. In the girls race, Lexa Fleming had the top Bayfield finish on both sides with a ninth-place run of 23:57. Rachel Cooper finished 13th (24:28), and Jade Sanders (35:04) and Mylee Sanders (35:29) came in at 55th and 56th, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:53:13.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
