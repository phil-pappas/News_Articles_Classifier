When they entered the apartment to search for any victims that may have been trapped, they found two adults and a child unconscious inside.\nAll three were taken to a nearby hospital. A family member said their condition is improving.\nA second child who was in the apartment at the time of the fire was pulled out by a neighbor before firefighters arrived. That child was also taken to the hospital to be treated for minor smoke inhalation, and released shortly after.\nFirefighters managed to get the fire under control and keep the fire from spreading to any other apartments.\n“The heart and soul of our fire department is those front line firefighters and the job they did last night was an incredible task: saving three family members\nand also keeping that fire at bay,” said Baton Rouge Fire Department Spokesman Curt Monte.\nInvestigators say none of the apartments had working smoke detectors.\nOctober 4 - 10 actually marks National Fire Prevention Week. This year's slogan, \"Hear the Beep While you Sleep,\" highlights the importance of smoke detectors.\n“Smoke detectors increase your chance for survival by more than 50 percent and it's just so extremely important that people heed that warning and check those detectors,” said Monte.\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
