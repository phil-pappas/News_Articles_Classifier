That was followed by a similar call from fast food giant McDonald's and financial services giant Visa. \nThe intervention from the major sponsors come a week after the 79-year-old Swiss was placed under criminal investigation by Swiss authorities for alleged financial wrongdoing at FIFA, which he has led since 1998. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:49:45.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
