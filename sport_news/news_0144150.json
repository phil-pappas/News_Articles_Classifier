They are a very good defense, very good front. Secondary has a lot of playmakers, very athletic in the secondary. So we knew it was going to be hard. ... A very good fight to the end, and it sure was.\"\nThe Raiders found themselves on the short end of a 22-20 decision Sunday at Soldier Field.\n\"This was just one of those old-fashioned NFL fights, down to the wire,\" Carr said. \"It came down to the end and they made a great play.\"\nRaiders coach Jack Del Rio said his team was not thrown off in its preparation when it came to the questionable status of Jay Cutler starting after he missed a game with a hamstring injury.\n\"No, we knew he'd play,\" Del Rio said. \"It was a really hard-fought, back-and-forth game. Give them credit.\"\nCarr completed 20 of 33 passes for 196 yards and two touchdowns. He was intercepted once and had a passer rating of 84.9.\n\"(The Bears) had the ball a lot in that first half,\" Carr said. \"So it was hard to get into that rhythm.\"\nThe Raiders were held to a pair of Sebastian Janikowski field goals in the second half, including a 41-yarder that gave them a 20-19 lead with 2:05 left. The Bears secondary prevented deep pass plays to the Raiders' speedy receivers. Amari Cooper was targeted nine times but caught just four passes.\n\"They liked to double (team) Amari a lot,\" Carr noted. \"And I don't blame them. He's a good football player.\"\nThe Bears defense claimed turnovers on an interception by Pernell McPhee that bounced off running back Latavius Murray and a fourth-quarter fumble by Murray that was recovered by Sam Acho.\n\"They have a solid front,\" Murray said. \"They're a good defense.\"\nfmitchell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kicker34\n Oakland Raiders Chicago Bears Jack Del Rio Jay Cutler Sebastian Janikowski Sam Acho Bill Parcells", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611f4d0/turbine/ct-raiders-sider-spt-1005-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:49:35.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
