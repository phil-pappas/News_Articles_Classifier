Four sacks in the first half. Two holding penalties drawn in the second. The Dolphins (2-3) forced four turnovers. Marcus Mariota was on the hook for all four.\nMeanwhile, Lamar Miller found his footing after a quiet first month to the season. He ran for 113 yards on 19 carries and had a touchdown.\nRyan Tannehill, meanwhile, wasn't great, but it didn't really matter. He completed 22 of 29 passes for 266 yards and two touchdowns, but did throw a pair of interceptions.\nCampbell wanted to start fast and establish the run. The Dolphins did both on their very first drive. Miami marched 80 yards in seven plays, and Jarvis Landry gave his team its first first-half lead of the season when he took an end-around 22 yards for a touchdown.\nAfter the teams traded field goals, neither seemed to want the football. A Tannehill interception -- which bounced off Jordan Cameron's hands -- was sandwiched by two Mariota lost fumbles. Wake caused each one.\nThe second lost fumble led to a 7-yard Miller touchdown, and gave the Dolphins their biggest lead of the season.\nThen in the third quarter, Reshad Jones extended the lead to three scores, intercepting Mariota and returning it 30 yards for a touchdown.\nTennesee (1-4) did add a touchdown on the final play of the third quarter -- a 3-yard pass from Mariota to Dexter McCluster -- to keep it someone interesting.\nAnd it became even more so after a Dolphins three-and-out gave the Titans the ball on the Miami 27. That's when Brent Grimes showed up. He picked off Mariota's next throw.\nNine plays and 97 yards later, the lead was 21 points again. Tannehill connected with Dion Sims on a 2-yard touchdown pass to put the game away.\n(c)2015 Miami Herald\nVisit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739823", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739823&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739823&h=Miami+Dolphins+crush+Titans+38%2D10+in+Dan+Campbell%27s+coaching+debut"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:37:07.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
