The Pioneers improved their records to 2-2-1 in the league, 7-2-3 overall. “It was a nice win, puts us in second place,” Mac-Hi coach Martin Martinez said. “We controlled most of the game, double-teaming their key player (Josie Ash). We took her out of the picture, and they had only five shots on goal.” Pioneers goalie Vilde Roemo recorded the shutout with her five saves. Mac-Hi jumped ahead in the first 10 minutes, when Jacky Gomez saw an opening and slipped a pass to Slusarenko, who scored with a shot that curved around the opposing goalie. The Pioneers ended up totalling 32 shots on goal, but only Slusarenko managed to hit the back of the net. “It was a short field, so you’d think we could take advantage, but to be honest, it was thick. My players got tired trying to play on it,” Martinez said. “We outplayed Baker. The score doesn’t show that, but we kept pressuring (Ash), we didn’t let them have many chances, and Vilde Roemo played a great game.” Mac-Hi next plays its last game of the regular season Saturday at home against Ontario.
