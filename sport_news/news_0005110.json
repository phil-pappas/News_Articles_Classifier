I've been fined a few times by the FA for stepping out of line, and my argument is, 'Where does that money go? Does it go to charity? Does it go to pay for the hundreds and hundreds of people who will jump on the back of the Euros?' \n\"When I asked, I didn't get an answer. We talk about transparency; if you're going to take that sort of money off an individual - his money - then let us know where it's going. \n\"I'd love the FA to be transparent and tell us which bank it's put in and how it's spent. I was told generally it goes into the funds and is spent in different ways.\" \nPulis feels the media demands on managers have an inevitable consequence given the pressure they are put under in the Premier League. \nAnd the Welshman warned that managers will become increasingly reticent during television interviews if fines such as the one given to Mourinho continue. \n\"Where we have to be careful is that this is a game of emotion, and managers get emotionally involved,\" said Pulis. \n\"Part and parcel of the Premier League is the emotional flavour - on and off the pitch. \n\"Sometimes managers come on TV and go over the top and sometimes they need a slap round the wrist. But we need to be careful we don't put ourselves in a position where we just come on and nod our heads, and say nothing, because we're frightened we'll get punished and fined £50,000. \n\"We have to get together as a union and talk together about the way we start approaching the press conferences after games, because if the FA is going to start fining people extraordinary amounts of money then we need to do something about it.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:10:37.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
