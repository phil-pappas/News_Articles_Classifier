(AP) Kentucky women's basketball coach Matthew Mitchell announced that sophomore guard Chrishae Rowe has been dismissed from the team for failing to uphold the program's standards. \nMitchell didn't specify the reasons behind Rowe's dismissal but said Thursday in a statement that ''we wish Chrishae well in her future endeavors and we hope she can find success in her life.'' \nThe 5-foot-10 Rowe transferred to Kentucky from Oregon in January and would have been eligible to play for the Wildcats after the fall semester. She was the Pac-12's Freshman of the Year and earned all-conference honors after averaging 21.6 points per game for the Ducks. Her 690 points set a school freshman record and were just three shy of Alison Lang's season mark.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:05:24.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
