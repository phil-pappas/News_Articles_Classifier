Video of the Sept. 4 incident created a national stir. \nThe UIL suspended Breed, who previously resigned from San Antonio Jay High School, for the rest of the school year and gave him two years’ probation. He could have been suspended for three years. \nHead coach Gary Guttierez was given two years’ probation. \nThe players were suspended from sports for the rest of the school year.
