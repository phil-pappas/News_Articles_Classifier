The Cougars – ranked for the first time in four years - did all it needed early en route to the fifth 6-0 start in school history. \nThe win extends UH's winning streak to eight games dating back to last season. It was also the Cougars' fourth straight win by double-digits. \nTulane managed only a second-quarter touchdown – aided by a fake punt – and had only 262 yards total offense against a stingy UH defense. Both were season low totals for the Cougars. \nThe Green Wave, without starting quarterback Tanner Lee (concussion), had 11 punts in the game in losing for the 39th straight time against a ranked opponent. \nWard finished 17-of-25 for 222 yards with one touchdown and added 77 rushing yards and three more scores. Ayers had six catches for 93 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:18:35.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
