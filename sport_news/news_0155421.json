It's the World Cup, you have worked hard for it and when you get to possibly three finals to play, you miss out. \n\"The same happened to Michael Hooper last week. His grandparents came over to watch him play last weekend and he was suspended. I know it's a little thing but it's important. You feel for the players.\" \nHowever, the Wallabies coach does not think their enforced absences will weaken Scotland. \nHe said: \"I haven't watched many games yet but I know the two players from their history with Scotland. They are very influential but I think these types of tournaments are made for people stepping up. \n\"The guys who will replace those two are ready to roll. We understand there will be 23 players in the Scotland jersey trying to smash us. It doesn't matter the names on the jerseys.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:06:17.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
