(Image Source: Darren McCollester/Getty Images) \nAround the NFL in Week 7: \n-6 & Oh: With wins on Sunday, the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers joined the Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers (all were idle in Week 7) with 6-0 records to start the 2015 campaign. Five teams to start a season 6-0 is a new NFL record for a single season. \n-Brady Milestones: New England Patriots QB Tom Brady was 34 of 54 passing for 355 yards and two TDs (94.3 rating). In the process, he joined Brett Favre , Peyton Manning , Dan Marino and Drew Brees as the only passers with 55,000 yards through the air. This was Brady’s 17 th career game with 350-plus passing yards, at least two TDs and no INTs, which is the most in the history of the league. It was also his 213 th start, setting a Patriots franchise mark, breaking the previous record held by Bruce Armstrong (212). \n-Dynamic Duos (AFC): Staying in the AFC East, Miami Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill connected on 18 of 19 passes (94.7%) for 282 yards and four TDs (no INTs) for a passer rating of 158.3, which is the highest-possible rating a passer can attain. Tannehill completed his first 18 passes in Miami’s win over Houston and he completed his final seven attempts last week, giving him 25-consecutive completed passes, a new NFL record. \nIn the same game RB Lamar Miller scored on a 54-yard catch and an 85-run making him the second player— Chris Johnson was the first—to have a TD catch of at least 50 yards and an 85-plus yard scoring scamper in the same game, the only one to do it in the same quarter. \n-Dynamic Duos (NFC): Atlanta Falcons QB Matt Ryan led his team to their sixth win of the season, throwing for 251 yards against the Tennessee Titans. In his 117 th career game Ryan eclipsed the 30,000-yard plateau, making him the fifth fastest to do so. Only Aaron Rodgers (116), Peyton Manning (115), Dan Marino (114) and Kurt Warner (114) got their quicker. \nComplementing Ryan’s passing is the running of Devonta Freeman , who rumbled for 116 yards. He now has 621 yards and nine scores on the ground making him just the fourth player to reach 600 yards and nine TDs in the first seven games to start a season at the age of 23 (or younger). Who are the first three? None others than Hall of Famers Jim Brown (1958 & 59), Eric Dickerson (1983) and Emmitt Smith (1992)…impressive company. \n-Rookie Watch: St. Louis Rams RB Todd Gurley ran for 128 yards and two TDs against the Cleveland Browns, following up his past two games in which he ran for 146 and 159 yards. The last time a rookie ran for 125-plus yards in his first three career starts was Cadillac Williams in 2005. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
