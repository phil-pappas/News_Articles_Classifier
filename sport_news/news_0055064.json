We had two outright wins, three losses and a tie. If we had gotten the opening odds, which is how we do the picks on the website, we were five picks up and three down. It is our fault for not setting a sure date and odds for the picks clearly and in the future all picks will be based on the Las Vegas opening odds, the standard we use on the website. Using the opening odds the overall numbers for the past four weeks stand at 17 picks right and seven wrong. We had the Thursday night game wrong as the Falcons played poorly and lost. We are researching what our results are on Thursday night games because we suspect the short week and its effect on each team’s performance could be throwing the model a curve that we are not able to see clearly. The Broncos had a poor showing and needed overtime to beat the lowly Browns and therefore failed to cover the 4.5-point spread. Our other loss came on Monday night in a sloppy game between the Giants and the Eagles. The SpecuMetrix model had the Giants as a good bet to cover the 3.5-point spread, but they ended up losing by a wide margin in a mistake-filled game. The winners included the Bengals and Jets, who dispatched their foes with relative ease and produced double-digit wins that easily covered their spreads. The Vikings needed a late turnover to win and cover. The surprising and plucky Bears kept it close and eventually lost in overtime on a Lions field goal, but SpecuMetrix had it right again as Chicago covered the 3.5-point spread. The line for this game moved during the week and depending on when you placed your bet you could have had a win or a loss. Finally the model had the Patriots as a good bet to cover what was at the time we made our predictions a 6.5-point spread. They did, winning by seven against the Colts. The line in last week's column was -11 and we still stayed on the Patriots, which was a mistake. SpecuMetrix picks are made on Wednesday using the Las Vegas opening odds, so it is always wise to consult the website at www.SpecuMetrix.com to make sure there hasn't been a significant line change. One game that has already seen some line movement this week is the Jets vs. the Patriots. Some early lines were as low as 4.5 or 5 and now that line is all the way up to -9.5 in the favor of the Patriots in some places. SpecuMetrix says take the stingy Jets and the points, which we have as 9.5. The Browns just about beat the Broncos last week and the SpecuMetrix model likes the them to keep it respectable against the Rams, who, like the Broncos, are having trouble scoring. Take the Browns and the 4 points. The Bills might have Tyrod Taylor back under center at Wembley Stadium in London where they play the very bad Jaguars. The model likes the Bills to win and cover the spread at -3.5. This line has moved as much as 3 points at some sports books so check the line before you bet. Two teams with losing records but rich histories against each other meet in San Diego as the Raiders and Chargers play in what could look like an Oakland home game. The Raiders are liked by the computer to cover as a 4-point road dog. Finally, in what is my favorite game of the week, the Cardinals are home to play the Ravens. The model likes the Cardinals to cover the -6.5 point spread and I make this the Specumetrix.com pick of the week.
