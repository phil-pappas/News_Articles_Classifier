Self, who went missing near Paradise Point State Park , near Port Orford.\nThe captain of the Sea Hunt, Michael Fowler, was searching for some lost crab pots in rough surf on the afternoon of Jan. 25 when a large wave struck, the lawsuit alleges. All three occupants of the boat – Fowler, Self and Ariana Hall – were tossed into cold water.\n\"Fowler and Hall were able to swim to shore, but Self drowned in the rough surf ,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"Although his body was never recovered, Self is presumed dead, and the Oregon Health Authority issued a death certificate on or about April 27.\"\nThe lawsuit names as defendants Michael Fowler, the vessel's operator, and Claudia and Vernon Fowler, the owners of the Sea Hunt. The Fowlers are accused of wrongful death and maritime negligence.\nMichael Fowler, reached by phone Wednesday afternoon, said he had not been served with the lawsuit and declined to comment until he had read it.\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["http://www.kval.com/news/local/Man-lost-at-sea-after-boat-capsizes-289819741.html", "http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=42"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:21:34.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
