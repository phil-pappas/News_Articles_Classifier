University of California, Regents i \nclocke@sacbee.com \nAir Force hero Spencer Stone, who thwarted a terrorist attack on a French train in August, was released Thursday from UC Davis Medical Center, where he had been treated for stab wounds suffered in a late-night fight last week on a midtown Sacramento street. \nThe medical center issued a news release announcing Stone’s release and expressing his and his family’s gratitude for the public’s support. \nStone, 23, issued a written statement thanking the emergency responders and the team at UC Davis Medical Center for caring for him. \n“Thanks, also, to my amazing family and friends for their love and support,” he said. “And thanks to everyone who has sent encouragement during this challenging time. I’m focused now on healing and recovering and look forward to the next part of my journey.” \nStone was stabbed three times during a fight at 12:45 a.m. at 21st and K streets. He was rushed to UC Davis Medical Center, where he underwent surgery. \nOfficer Traci Trapani, a Sacramento police spokeswoman, said Thursday that investigators were still working to identify Stone’s assailants. Surveillance video shows Stone fighting with at least two assailants in the intersection before he is stabbed. \nThe Police Department on Wednesday released more camera images of the vehicle they believe was driven by Stone’s attackers. The photos were captured on a Police Observation Device camera in midtown. The still images were captured before the assault. \nPolice have described the assailants as two Asian men wearing white shirts and blue jeans. They are believed to have fled eastbound on K Street in a dark-colored 2009 to 2012 Toyota Camry. \nTwo months ago, Stone and Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler, boyhood friends from Sacramento, thwarted a terrorist attack when they tackled and subdued an armed man on a Paris-bound train. \nThe would-be terrorist was armed with an AK-47, a Luger pistol and a box cutter. Stone suffered cuts to the neck and a deep wound on a thumb in that incident. The three were lauded in France and in Washington, D.C. \nUC Davis Medical Center officials said Stone’s family requests that the public continue to respect their privacy. \nStone’s mother, Joyce Eskel, said in a written statement, “Our family wishes to express our deepest gratitude to the staff and providers at UC Davis Medical Center. I’m especially grateful to (trauma surgeons) Dr. Ellie Curtis, Dr. Garth Utter, the entire trauma team and the ICU nurses who treated Spencer so well. We’ve been overwhelmed by the support from our family and friends, the Sacramento area, the Air Force and people around the world. Thank you all.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:51:40.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
