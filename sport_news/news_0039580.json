Scotland, led by running back Zamir White, is hoping to hold on their #1 ranking. White has been averaging 190 ypg on the ground this season. But Christian Ledbetter and the Pinecrest offense has been unstoppable, putting up 347 total points so far this season. This could be an offensive showdown and who ever wins could be one stop away from taking the Southeastern conference this season. Charlotte Catholic vs South Mecklenburg Game Preview: Charlotte Catholic has certainly been one of the top teams in the 4A and has only given up 20 points so far this season, which is an outstanding stat six games in. They have four shutouts already this season but South Mecklenburg has been solid this season but is coming off their first loss of the season. To get back on track with a win against Charlotte Catholic team could be a tremendous confidence boost heading down the stretch. South Meck has some talent such as Chance Kennedy, Jacobe Clement, and Jake Lawler that could give Charlotte Catholic some issues. Hough vs AL Brown Game Preview: This is the second week in a row for Hough being on our list, but after you take down Mallard Creek and then head into a battle with AL Brown, who is undefeated on the season. Can Jackson Gibbs and company do it for the second week in a row and really push their team in the discussion for the top team in the 4A? Or will Damon Johnson and AL Brown continue their undefeated season. Last season, Hough took home a 44-20 win against AL Brown.
