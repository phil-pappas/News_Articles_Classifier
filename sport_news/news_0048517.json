I didn’t think about it.” \nBut the coach went on to admit attending the palace would be a thrill. \n“This is one (event) I’m sure that everyone will enjoy doing – the lads that are going. \n“I think there’s four or five – the captain and a couple of others.” \nEngland head coach Stuart Lancaster and captain Chris Robshaw chatted with Prince Harry in the sumptuous palace ballroom. \nSpeaking to South African wing Bryan Habana and lock Victor Matfield, Harry said he hoped disappointed England fans would now back teams from neighbouring nations such as Scotland, Wales and Ireland. \n“I asked him if he thought people would still support now England is out,” Matfield said after meeting the prince. \n“He said that the people still love rugby and hoped they will give support to some other home nation teams.” \nThe Webb Ellis Cup, which will be awarded to the winning team, was placed in pride of place on a plinth at the reception, as Queen Elizabeth’s husband Prince Philip and their daughter Anne looked on. \nRepresentatives from each of the 20 competing teams were welcomed to the reception. \nQueen Elizabeth was presented with a Rugby World Cup participant medal by former England rugby captain Bill Beaumont and World Rugby Chairman Bernard Lapasset.
