Servais will be formally introduced by the team next week. \nNew Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto made the announcement. Servais has worked the past five seasons as an assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Angels and worked alongside Dipoto for most of that time. Dipoto resigned as Angels GM on July 1. \nNot only did Dipoto and Servais work together with the Angels, they were teammates for one season in Colorado in 2000. \nServais oversaw the Angels' scouting and player development, and had wanted to be on a major league coaching staff. He joined Dipoto and the Angels in 2011 after spending six seasons as the senior director of player development with Texas. Servais was credited with the growth of slugger Nelson Cruz during the time together with the Rangers - Cruz now plays for Seattle. \nServais spent time with Houston, the Cubs and San Francisco during his playing career. He hit .245 with 63 home runs and 319 RBIs in 820 career games. Servais served as a catching instructor for the Cubs for two seasons after retiring and was a scout in Colorado before joining the Rangers front office in 2005. \nThe hiring makes Servais the 10th full-time and interim manager for the Mariners since the club's last playoff appearance in 2001. \nMcClendon lasted two seasons. After a promising first year when the Mariners won 87 games and missed the postseason by one game, Seattle finished 10 games under .500 this year and in fourth place in the AL West despite the likes of Felix Hernandez, Robinson Cano and Cruz. \nThe regression led to the firing of general manager Jack Zduriencik in late August and ultimately a change on the bench with Dipoto deciding to bring in his own manager, rather than keep McClendon around under the final year of his original contract. \nMcClendon was fired on Oct. 9, less than a week after the regular season ended. Dipoto went out of his way to praise McClendon but ultimately wanted the power to pick who he would work with going forward. \nSeattle also reportedly interviewed Angels' special assistant Tim Bogar, Tampa Bay third base coach Charlie Montoyo and former Boston catcher Jason Varitek for the managerial position. \nThere is a chance Bogar will join Servais' staff, possibly as bench coach. Bogar was the interim manager for Texas at the end of the 2014 season and was a favorite to get the job full-time but the position went to Jeff Banister. Texas won the AL West in Banister's first season. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
