For the first few weeks, that’s exactly what they were. A strong rushing attack, along with solid play from the defense, made the Redskins competitive. But in the past two weeks, Washington ran for a combined 85 yards, picking up just 34 yards against the Jets. \nGranted, the Redskins played the Jets without starting offensive linemen Trent Williams and Kory Lichtensteiger. However, Lichtensteiger had not been playing that well, and the other players failed to step up. I wanted to see more from Scherff and Morgan Moses, who became the experienced side of the offensive line despite starting the season as the least experienced. \nThis is a counter zone play. The offensive line blocks to its left while tight end Derek Carrier sifts back across the line as a lead blocker for Alfred Morris. \nOn the right side of the line, Scherff and Moses both lose their blocks early. Scherff fails to chip the defender in the B gap between himself and Moses, making it hard for Moses to reach him inside. Scherff then misses the linebacker on the second level. Spencer Long also struggles to maintain his block, allowing his man into the backfield. By the time Morris gets the ball, there are three defenders in the backfield. \nMorris has nowhere to go and gets tackled for a loss. \nScherff and Moses weren’t at their best, but at times they could have been helped to make things a little easier for them. \nHere, the Jets overload the right side of the offensive line, bringing a defensive back into the box. The play that was called was a run to the right, but the defensive alignment makes that a tall order. By running to the right, Long and center Josh LeRibeus have to go a long way to reach blocks, as do Scherff and Moses. It also requires fullback Darrel Young to pick up the extra defender. \nLeRibeus and Long actually do a good job reaching their blocks, although Long struggles to gain leverage. But the biggest problem came from Moses and Scherff. Moses blocked the player in front of him, leaving Scherff with nobody to block and Young with two players to block on the edge. \nYoung picks up the edge defender, but that still left the defensive back to run free and tackle Morris in the backfield for another negative run. \nIn my opinion, Cousins should have flipped the run at the line of scrimmage, changing to the play to a run to the left. \nWith the play run to the left, the blocking looks significantly easier. LeRibeus doesn’t have to reach a block, instead blocking the guy in front of him. Long and left tackle Ty Nsekhe could have double teamed the defender in the B gap before one of them worked up to the linebacker. Carrier would have been tasked with kicking the edge defender outside, leaving Young as a lead blocker without a pre-determined assignment. That to me, looks like a far better run than the play they opted for. \nA common misconception that fans have with regards to the failure of the run game is the notion that teams are stacking the box because they don’t fear Cousins throwing over the top of them. While it’s true teams are bringing a safety into the box to help defend the run, it’s not the pretense of an extra defender that is blowing up the run game. \nHere, the Jets stack the box with eight defenders against the run. \nBut the number of defenders isn’t the reason this play gets blown up. The back side edge defender goes unblocked and drifts up the field to contain and take away the bootleg. The Redskins then have enough blockers to block the rest of the defenders in the box. The problem for Washington is the lack of execution. LeRibeus gets driven back off the line of scrimmage straight into Morris. The two tight ends work a double team, but struggle to block the edge defender. That leaves the eighth defender unblocked, although they have enough blockers to account for him. \nWith the tight ends struggling to maintain the edge, LeRibeus being driven back and Nsekhe missing his cut block on the back side, Morris has nowhere to go. Guards Scherff and Long actually make good blocks on linebackers at the second level, so if just one of LeRibeus or Nsekhe had better blocks, Morris might have been able to make a cut and salvage the play. But notice the eighth player, who has no impact on the play. Neither does the back side edge defender. \nEight defenders in the box isn’t ideal, but as we can see here, it’s the execution that hurt the Redskins run game, not an extra defender. The Redskins have been successful in the past running against eight defenders in the box; both Miami and St.Louis used extra defenders in the box and the Redskins ran for a combined 343 yards against them. The fact is, almost every defense brings an eighth man into the box against teams that want to run the ball, but the successful running teams still find ways to run the ball. The Redskins’ execution wasn’t good enough. \nWhile the performance of the players wasn’t good enough, I’d also hold Jay Gruden accountable. To be a truly dominant rushing attack, Washington has to be committed to it. Ideally, you’d like to have an equal split of run and pass plays but there are times when that’s not possible. Against the Jets, however, Washington had plenty of opportunities to attempt to establish the run. In the first quarter they had 16 plays, only five of which were running plays. In the second quarter, with the score close or tied, the Redskins ran the ball on just six of 20 plays. \nThe trend continued into the third quarter, running the ball on just three of 11 plays. Gruden might argue that Washington was so far behind, considering the Jets scored touchdowns on both drives after Kirk Cousins’s interceptions, that they had to pass to catch up. But I would argue that because Cousins had thrown two interceptions in that quarter, they might have tried running the ball more to help settle him down. \nI’ve heard some fans suggest the Redskins had to pass because the run game wasn’t working. But that was the case in the Eagles game back in Week 4. The Redskins’ run game never really got going against Philadelphia, but because Gruden showed a commitment to it, it wore down the Eagles’ defensive front. Out of the Redskins 15 plays on the game-winning drive, five of them were runs that totaled 41 yards. The persistence with the running game paid off against the Eagles, but Gruden gave up on it too early against the Jets. \nIt’s not as if the Redskins had zero successful running plays either. They found ways to pick up yards, they just didn’t use the successful plays enough. \nThis play came early in the second quarter. It’s designed for the running back to get outside on the edge and burst up the field. \nThe offensive line all reach across their blocks and pin their defenders inside. Young cut blocks the edge defender and Morris is given a clean path to the outside. \nIt takes the deep free safety charging down to the line of scrimmage to trip up Morris and make the tackle. But Morris picked up five yards on the play, which should have given them plenty of encouragement to run this concept more. \nBut the Redskins rarely went back to the play. It wasn’t until the third quarter that I saw a similar concept. \nThis time, Chris Thompson was in the game in place of Morris, but the concept remained the same. \nLike before, we see the offensive linemen reach across their defenders and pin them inside. Scherff is the only one to struggle to reach his defender. \nThompson displays good patience here. Initially, it appears the linebacker had managed to evade Scherff, but Thompson gives Scherff time to recover and kick the linebacker outside. That allows Thompson to cut back up the field on his way to a five-yard gain. \nBoth Morris and Thompson picked up five-yard gains from this concept, which makes me wonder why the Redskins didn’t stick with it. That, for me, is on Gruden and the coaching staff. \nThe talk among Redskins fans and media this week is about the performance of Cousins and Gruden’s perceived coddling of him . After the game, Gruden said , “We didn’t get much movement in the running game, and that’s also putting a lot of pressure on our quarterback.” Gruden talks about having a team effort and needing the run game and the defense to support the quarterback. But he can’t forget he’s a part of that team. If he thinks the run game can take pressure off the quarterback, then he needs to give it a chance to do that. To give the lead back just 11 carries and the backup just five goes completely against the foundation that McCloughan is trying to put in place. \nMark Bullock is The Insider’s Outsider , sharing his Redskins impressions without the benefit of access to the team.
