While some anticipated a bidding war among apparel companies for the Texas brand, Nike's previous contract included a clause that allowed it to match or exceed any offer. \nNike did not immediately return a message seeking comment. A University of Texas spokesman declined comment. \nThe deal comes shortly after Texas forced out former athletic director Steve Patterson after less than two years on the job. Mike Perrin, a Houston trial attorney who played linebacker for the Longhorns in the 1960s, is serving as interim athletic director under a one-year contract. \nTexas has long ranked among the top sellers of logo and brand-oriented t-shirts, hats and other apparel. The school also has other unique and financially substantial contracts, such as its 20-year, $300 million Longhorn Network venture with ESPN. \nThe new deal with Nike suggests that the Texas name and its signature burnt orange school color remain a powerful financial force despite recent struggles in football, its highest-profile sport. The Longhorns finished 6-7 in 2014 and are just 2-4 in coach Charlie Strong's second season. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:36:55.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
