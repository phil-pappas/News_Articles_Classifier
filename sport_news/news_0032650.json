They were offended by his remarks just hours after a 26-year-old student, Christopher Harper-Mercer, fatally shot his teacher and eight students and wounded nine others.\n\"People are ready for the healing process here and he's just dragging it out, salting the wounds,\" said Lori Altman, 60, who came to Roseburg with her husband, Dan, from nearby Sutherlin.\n\"He shouldn't be here,\" she said.\nHer husband wore a T-shirt with Uncle Sam on the back and the words: \"What part of 'shall not be infringed' do you not understand?\" The couple waved a large American flag.\nThe Altmans and several others also held signs saying they support Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, a staunch supporter of gun rights who has refused to say the shooter's name.\nSeveral people said they were angry with the media, claiming reporters have covered up that last week's shooting was a hate crime against Christians. Some survivors have said the gunman asked people about their faith before shooting them.\n\"Black lives matter, but Christian lives don't matter?\" said Sharon Bart, who wore a gold cross and silver peace sign necklaces.\nThe gathering was mostly trouble-free. But things heated up a few times between demonstrators with opposing views. At one point, a woman started yelling, \"I am unarmed!\" A man yelled back, \"Arm the teachers!\" She retorted, \"Arm the preschoolers!\"\nThe protest's Facebook page, Defend Roseburg , suggested demonstrators bring water, snacks and â€“ if they felt the need, carry firearms -- but only to take handguns and keep them holstered. Many did.\nThe protest page also featured a photograph of a doormat with the message across it that read, \"Not Welcome!\"\nThe theme continued at the protest with people carrying signs reading: \"Obama Go Home,\" \"Obama go back to Kenya,\" \"I support the 2 nd Amendment NOT OBAMA\" and \"Gun Free Zones = Kill Zones.\"\nObama supporter hopes to represent 'silent majority' Dulcie Bagley, a resident of Roseburg, shows her support for President Obama.\nBut not everyone there felt so strongly. A small number came to support the president's visit. And others said they were simply there for the shooting victims and the school, considered the center of the community.\nBryony Allenby, 37, of Winchester stood to the north of the larger group of protesters. She and her family all wore \"I am UCC\" T-shirts. They live close enough to the college to have heard the gunshots last week.\nEveryone in the area, she said, is connected to the school. She and her family support the police and the president's visit, which she described as a \"rare privilege\" regardless of politics.\n\"I am embarrassed of what's going on up there,\" Allenby said, pointing to the main group of protesters.\nAfter driving north from Myrtle Creek, Dan Marsh wasn't there to protest the president. The 70-year-old said he supported the trip if Obama could console the families. But if Obama immediately turns the conversation back to gun control, he said, he'll know the president wasn't genuine with his trip to southern Oregon.\nMarsh is a family friend of 18-year-old Rebecka Ann Carnes, who was killed in the shooting. He was at the airport for her and the other victims. The president's message immediately after the rampage riled him, he said.\n\"You don't want to know what I said to him over the TV,\" he said.\nObama spent about 90 minutes in Roseburg and met privately with the families. He made a brief statement afterward to the press corps, saying the country must come together to figure out how to prevent mass shootings.\n\"I've got some very strong feelings about this because when you talk to these families you're reminded that this could be happening to your child or your mom or your dad or your relative or your friend,\" he said.\n\"But today it's about the families,\" he said.\nAs the president flew out of Roseburg Regional Airport, heading north to Seattle, the protesters had largely left, too.\n Ian Kullgren of The Oregonian/OregonLive contributed to this report.\n-- Rebecca Woolington\nrwoolington@oregonian.com\n503-294-4049; @rwoolington", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/events/1642689462646090/", "https://twitter.com/rwoolington"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:06:59.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
