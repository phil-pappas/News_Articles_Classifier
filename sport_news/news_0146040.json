He took part in warming up on Wednesday and then moved to the rehab field for the remaining portion of the 30 minutes practice was open to the media. \nJones didn't practice last Wednesday due to an elbow injury he had suffered in the Baltimore game and was listed as questionable for the Kansas City game because of that injury, but started. \nWhitworth was listed as missing Wednesday due to what was termed non-injury related, which means he got a veteran's day off as he has each week so far this season and did almost every week last season. \nGilberry missed due to a calf injury. He did some work on the rehab field during the time practice was open to the media. \nHill, who scored three touchdowns in Sunday's win over Kansas City, was a limited participant due to a knee injury. \nCornerback Leon Hall (non-injury related) and safety Reggie Nelson (hamstring) were also limited participants. \nIloka missed Sunday's game against Kansas City due to an ankle injury and was also a limited participant. He didn't practice at all last week and said that was tougher on him than missing the game. \n\"It was hard on Wednesday and Thursday coming up here knowing I'm missing my first game ever,\" said Iloka. \"As the week goes by you have confidence in guys that they're going to go out there and do their thing. The fact that we came out with the win made it even easier for me.\" \nJeremy Hill photo: Tony Tribble \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
