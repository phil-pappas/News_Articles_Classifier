The hitting side boasts potential franchise cornerstones like Mookie Betts and Xander Bogaerts. The pitching side, not so much, outside of perhaps left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez. \nHere's a look at a group that may not need a complete overhaul, but certainly could use its share of upgrades as president of baseball ops Dave Dombrowski tackles the rotation and bullpen. \nMatt Barnes \nContract Status: Under team control \nHe's a starter. He's a reliever. He's a starter. He's a reliever. We could keep going like this for six more paragraphs. So what is he? The power arsenal and lack of refined secondary offerings suggest Barnes' future rests in the bullpen. But his command issues (5.3 BB/9 at Triple-A) and the hittable nature of his mid-90s fastball mean he'll have to improve if he's to stick. \nCraig Breslow \nContract Status: Free agent \nBreslow improved on a forgettable 2014, but still wasn't particularly good, allowing an OPS of over .800 to both left- and right-handed hitters. The Red Sox should look elsewhere. \nClay Buchholz \nContract Status: Red Sox hold $13 million club option for 2016 \nFirst off, it would be crazy not to exercise the option, and the Red Sox aren't crazy. If you enter a Buchholz season with eyes wide open, it's not horrific. He's generally good for 10-12 wins, an ERA in the mid-3.00s, and about 140 innings pitched. We'd love to see more durability, but at this point just accept him for what he is -- imperfect, but useful. \nRyan Cook \nContract Status: Arbitration eligible \nAn All-Star with the A's in 2012, Cook has steadily declined since. However, he's the definition of a low-risk flyer, and there's no harm in keeping him around in the hopes that he regains even his form of 2014 (1-3, 3.42, 50 Ks in 50 IP). \nHeath Hembree \nContract Status: Under team control \nHembree doesn't get much love, but he produced last year, posting a 2.20 ERA in the minors and a 3.55 mark in 22 appearances with the Red Sox. Take away his first outing (6 runs in mopup of an 18-7 loss to Orioles) and he posted a 1.50 ERA with Red Sox. He throws 95 mph and is trying to develop a curveball. He has shown some toughness late in games, too. \nRich Hill \nContract Status: Free agent \nHere's a fascinating one to watch. Hill looked reborn in September while blitzing through the AL East with three 10-strikeout games in a row. The 35-year-old Milton native hadn't started a game since 2009, but now he wants a chance to join a rotation. The Red Sox could be that team on a one-year, incentive-laden deal. Hill's wear and tear (1,274 professional IP) isn't anywhere near other pitchers his age. He could be a steal. \nBrian Johnson \nContract Status: Under team control \nColleague Rob Bradford caught up with Johnson , who explained that he doesn't need Tommy John surgery, which is a relief. He's got some ground to make up after missing the final two-plus months with elbow pain, however, because Henry Owens and Eduardo Rodriguez did more among his minor-league class to establish themselves down the stretch, and he also must contend with eye-opening runs from Joe Kelly and Hill. The crafty Johnson doesn't have much margin for error, since he only throws a low-90s fastball. \nJoe Kelly \nContract Status: Arbitration eligible \nThere are two schools thought of Kelly. One is that his unbeaten August, upper-90s fastball, and youth (27) make him a big-time breakout candidate for 2016. The other is that he has shown flashes before and since his value will never be higher, now is a good time to deal him away, perhaps as part of a larger deal for a better starter. Put me firmly in camp No. 2. \nTommy Layne \nContract Status: Under team control \nRepeat after me: Do not Tommy Layne face right-handers. Do not let Tommy Layne face right-handers. Do not let Tommy Layne face right-handers. Understood? With the Red Sox bullpen in shambles, Layne was called on to be something he's not. If used exclusively as a left-handed specialist, he's a force. Righties hit .322 with a .950 OPS against him, but lefties were rendered impotent to the tune of a .148 average and .418 OPS. \nJean Machi \nContract Status: Arbitration eligible \nAn effective reliever with the Giants in 2013-14, Machi posted a 5.12 ERA this year and struggled to keep the ball in the park with the Red Sox, allowing five homers in 23 innings. He did not impress. \nWade Miley \nContract Status: Will earn $6 million in second year of a 3-year, $19.25 million extension. \nMiley showed flashes of promise without ever quite putting it together. He went 6-1 when pitching seven or more innings, but just 2-6 when failing to last at least six frames. He also ranked in the top 10 in a number of unenviable categories: hits allowed (201), earned runs (95), wild pitches (10). He's in danger of being Just Another Guy. \nAlexi Ogando \nContract Status: Arbitration eligible \nOgando seemed like one of the stories of spring training, but he was hardly reliable once the real starting bell rang. His final numbers (3.99 ERA) don't tell the story of his ineffectiveness, and he certainly won't get another 64 appearances next year to fix things like his awful home run rate (1.7/9) or mediocre command (3.9 BB/9). \nHenry Owens \nContract Status: Under team control \nGut reaction to Owens' debut: he's limited. Like Johnson, Owens doesn't throw a blistering fastball, though he did touch 94 mph in August. He instead sits in the 89-91 range and it's fair to wonder how much that's going to play moving forward. Don't be surprised if he's moved. \nRick Porcello \nContract Status: Will make $20.125 million in first year of 4-year, $82.5 million extension \nThere's clearly more there than Porcello showed us in his Red Sox debut. The question is if he hit his ceiling during a 2014 season that led Dombrowski, then president of the Tigers, to decide he'd be better of cutting bait and trading him to the Red Sox. That Porcello (15-13, 3.43) is solid, but certainly not a $20 million pitcher. The Red Sox can only hope improved defense leads to better results for a guy whose game is putting the ball in play. \nNoe Ramirez \nContract Status: Under team control \nAt the end of the season, the Red Sox spoke of Ramirez as if he were a weapon against right-handed hitters. And yet he posted extreme reverse splits, allowing a .533 OPS to lefties and .867 OPS to righties. His Triple-A numbers were better, but still favored lefties (.661 to .641). With a fastball that averages 90 mph, Ramirez doesn't fit the new breed of power relievers, an issue the Red Sox have across their system. \nEduardo Rodriguez \nContract Status: Under team control \nAs good as Andrew Miller is, the trade that sent him to Baltimore will go down as a steal for the Red Sox. E-Rod won 10 games with a 3.85 ERA and a fastball that hit 98 mph. He allowed zero or one earned runs in more than half (11) of his 21 starts. As he expands his arsenal, perhaps to develop his cutter, he's only going to improve. Just 22 years old, he's just getting started. \nRobbie Ross \nContract Status: Arbitration eligible \nThe games may not have mattered at the end, but that doesn't change how surprisingly well Ross pitched after jumping off the minor-league shuttle on June 15. A disappointment to that point, Ross quietly held opponents to a .236 average and posted a 3.30 ERA thereafter. He finished the year closing garbage games and did as much to help his cause in 2016 as any reliever. \nJunichi Tazawa \nContract Status: Arbitration eligible \nSpring training is going to be telling for Tazawa, who looked cooked by the end of this year before the Red Sox wisely shut him down. The right-hander has been a workhorse, making 71 appearances in 2013 and 2014 before halting at 61 this year. His stuff had degraded noticeably at the end. Was that just fatigue, or something more? We’ll find out soon enough. \nKoji Uehara \nContract Status: Will make $9 million to conclude two-year, $18 million deal \nUehara is a little bit like teammate David Ortiz , in that there is much fretting about his age, but little drop-off in performance. By the time he was removed as closer during an All-Star 2014, the Red Sox had already given up on the season. This year, he cruised right along to a 2.25 ERA and 25 saves before a freak accident -- a line drive broke his wrist -- ended his campaign. He turns 41 in April and will face the age-old questions again, particularly now that he's coming off injury. \nAnthony Varvaro \nContract Status: Arbitration eligible \nVarvaro had surgery to repair a torn flexor tendon in his right arm in May and has been rehabbing in Fort Myers ever since. The Red Sox must decide whether to offer him arbitration or make him a free agent next month. When healthy, he was a solid performer in Atlanta under current Red Sox executive Frank Wren. \nBrandon Workman \nContract Status: Under team control \nWorkman underwent Tommy John surgery in June and realistically won't be a factor in the big leagues again until 2017. \nSteven Wright \nContract Status: Under team control \nThe classic swingman, Wright has some value as a depth starter and long man. He missed the end of the season with a concussion. The knuckleballer was slightly better as a starter (3-4, 3.96) than reliever last year (2-0, 4.43). \nJonathan Aro, Roman Mendez, Edwin Escobar \nContract Status: Under team control \nNone of the above. Maybe there's a surprise in here, but the Red Sox can do better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:59:33.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
