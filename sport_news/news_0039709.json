Someone later took it out of the tree and posted a photo of it on Instagram next to a trash bin.\nThe statue hasn't been seen since.\nRyan and her husband, an artist, bought the statue years ago for $1,200. Ryan says it has a \"slightly sinister quality.\"\nThey're offering a $300 reward.\nThe daughter was punished with extra chores.\n___\nInformation from: Daily Hampshire Gazette (Northampton, Mass.), http://www.gazettenet.com\nCopyright The Associated Press", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://bit.ly/1PyDJUg"], "published": "2015-10-17T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:06:31.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
