I love Sky 72. It's a great golf course. Getting a win, it means so much.\" \nLydia Ko missed a chance to take the top spot in the world from South Korean star Inbee Park, finishing with a 72 that dropped the 18-year-old South Korean-born New Zealander into a tie for fourth at 13 under with South Korea's Amy Yang and American Gerina Piller. \nYang birdied the final nine holes for a 62. She tied the LPGA Tour record for consecutive birdies set by Beth Daniel in the 1999 Philips Invitational, broke the nine-hole mark for relation to par at 9 under, and matched the record for the lowest nine-hole total at 27. Yang also tied the course record set by Sung Hyun Park on Thursday. \n\"I don't know what just happened. Just can't believe,\" Yang said. \"Shots were great. Early in the week I was shaky, but I don't know, this back nine was crazy good.\" \nThompson took a two-stroke lead with a birdie on the short par-4 15th, driving to the right of the green and hitting a flop shot to 8 feet. She hit her second shot on the par-5 18th into deep rough left of the green and lashed another flop to 12 feet to set up a two-putt par. \n\"I hit some good flop shot out of the rough today, which helped me out quite a bit,\" Thompson said. \"That's good. That's what I've been working on, my short game, my chipping and my putting.\" \nThompson opened with rounds of 68, 67 and 69 to enter the final round a shot behind Ko and Sung Hyun Park. The 6-foot Florida player birdied the final three holes on the front nine to take the lead. She bogeyed the par-4 11th, and got the stroke back with the birdie on 15. \nThompson finished at 15-under 273 and earned $300,000. She also won in July in Michigan. \nSung Hyun Park birdied the 18th for a 71 in her first start on the LPGA Tour. \nPlaying the group ahead of Thompson, Tseng birdied the final two holes for a 68. The former top-ranked player won the last of her 15 LPGA Tour titles in March 2012. \n\"Getting closer and closer,\" Tseng said. \"I'm very feeling good about my game.\" \nKo ended up needing to win or finish in a two-way tie for second to regain the top spot in the world. Inbee Park shot a 69 to tie for 15th at 8 under in her home event. \n\"It was great to just see family, my niece and nephews out here,\" Ko said. \"It's just really good to be able to play in front of them. Doesn't matter if I shoot even par, under par, over par, you don't get to play in front of family or relatives that often.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:49:47.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
