And this time, Moore said, the Lynx will be ready for the Fever.\n“Coming into the Finals that year, feeling like we weren’t as mentally tough as we needed to be,” Moore recalled. “It was a great lesson for us.”\nThe Lynx are in the Finals for the fourth time in five years. They won the title in 2011 and 2013.\n“We just have to believe in ourselves and not worry about what anyone else says,” said Fever forward Catchings, 36. “We know what we’re capable of doing.”\nJON KRAWCZYNSKI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:57:39.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
