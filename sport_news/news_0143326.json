By the end he was one of its biggest assets. Originally expected to join the Wildcats for the 2015-16 season, Tirone’s arrival had to be pushed up when the club needed another scholarship goaltender after three-year starter Casey DeSmith was dismissed from the program. Over the second half of the 2014-15 season Tirone emerged as a vital piece of a strong stretch run as the Wildcats reached the semifinals of the Hockey East playoffs for the second year in a row. “Last year I ended up in three different places,” said Tirone, who spent the first half of last season with the Boston Junior Bruins of the USPHL. “It feels good to know where I am and to know where I’ll be for the next couple years. It’s definitely a lot nicer this way.” Tirone turned into more than an insurance policy. He soon became the Wildcats’ No 1 option in net, appearing in 20 games overall and starting the last 16. He backstopped the team to eight straight wins from mid-February to mid-March, and during one stretch allowed only nine goals in nine games, including two shutouts. Tirone held eventual national champion Providence to four goals in three games as UNH upset the No. 10 Friars on the road in a best-of-three quarterfinal series in the Hockey East tournament. \"We feel like we're right there,\" Tirone said. \"It gives you a sense of confidence. We want to make sure we're there at the start.\" Tirone posted a 14-6 record last year with a 2.14 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage. He was named Hockey East goalie of the month for March. His GAA was the fourth lowest all-time for a single season at UNH and his SP was seventh best. “If you told me a couple years ago that would happen I would have been real excited,” he said of his early success at UNH. “I think I got a ton of experience, and I’m just trying to build off it this year.” Given that performance, Tirone will likely start his sophomore season as the Wildcats’ No. 1 netminder with sophomore Adam Clark and senior Jamie Regan also returning. “I think Danny’s probably leading it based on what happened last year,” coach Dick Umile said. “We’ll see how it goes early in the season.” “I think it’s a competition no matter what,” Tirone said. “You’re only as good as your last game.” The Wildcats’ have been holding captains’ practices with the first official practice scheduled for Saturday. They will host St. Francis Xavier in an exhibition game Sunday (4 p.m) at the Whittemore Center. “The preseason’s been pretty long,” said senior alternate captain Dan Correale. “You can try to simulate as much competition as you can against each other, but nothing’s ever like the real thing.” “I think the guys are anxious to play against somebody,” Umile said. “It’s a dress rehearsal so we’ll probably get a chance to do a little bit of everything.” UNH opens the regular season at home on Saturday, Oct. 10, against American International. The Wildcats will host St. Lawrence and Clarkson the following weekend (Oct. 16-17) before embarking on a six-game road trip that includes a pair of contests at Michigan State and two at league foe Merrimack. “We’re looking to get off to a hot start and get some momentum going early rather than later,” said senior alternate captain Maxim Gaudreault.” The Wildcats started slow in each of the last two seasons. They'll try to avoid that pitfall this time around. “When you don’t have a good start it’s kind of hard to find that consistency and to have the mindset that you’re going to win every night,” Correale said.
