They were able to gather themselves and find a foothold to keep from falling back into the abyss, but they did not make much upward progress. \nThat means that this season there is a lot of ground to make up for a Binghamton University men’s basketball program that has been mired in mediocrity for the past five seasons. The natives are getting restless, and they’re looking for signs that the program is at least moving back toward the top of the mountain after a 6-26 campaign. \nThe most important addition to bolster the Bearcats’ hopes of success this season will likely be the fully-functional right knee of sophomore center Dusan Perovic. Perovic, a 6-foot-9 native of Podgorica, Montenegro, received clearance to participate in full practices last month after having surgery in January to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament. \n“I feel like – and I’ve talked to the coaches about it – I’ve made a much bigger progress than we were expecting as far as coming back,” Perovic said before the Bearcats first full-team practice of the preseason on Friday afternoon in the Events Center. “I’m not really that far (away). It’s just a little bit of conditioning that I’ve got to work on, running up and down the court. Other than that, my game is already coming back and I already feel comfortable playing.” Binghamton U. men picked fifth in preview publications \nIn the second game last season, Perovic scored a team-high 13 points against a Providence College team that featured a pair of 7-footers. That night, he did most of his damage around the basket and made only one 3-pointer. \nEight games into his college career, Perovic set the program’s single-game scoring record (Division I era) with a 34-point effort on the road in a loss at Boston University. He went 6-for-8 from behind the 3-point line and a perfect 6-for-6 at the free throw line. \nAfter teasing Bearcats fans with all that promise, Perovic’s knee gave out during a non-contact drill in a January practice. The Bearcats lost a post presence as well as the most accurate outside shooter on their roster (45.3 percent on 3-pointers) all in one unfortunate instant. \nOn Friday, Perovic sported a black brace on his knee to go along with an extra 10 pounds of muscle – he is up to 235 pounds – that should help him absorb contact in his second season. \nGetting his body used to doing the twists, spins and awkward dance steps required to pull off post moves has been almost like learning the position all over again, but he’s excited to be back on the court. \n“I used a lot of that part of the season when I was injured and the offseason to just look at the game, look at a lot of tapes, and just learn the game more, the style that we play,” Perovic said. “I don’t think I was really too worried about how’s it going to be when I get back. I was just thinking about once I get back I want to help the team. That’s the only thing that’s in my mind right now.” Some of the sights and sounds from the first day of preseason with the Binghamton U. men's basketball team. Lynn Worthy \nHow much of a difference can Perovic make? \nLast season, the Bearcats were one of the least productive offensive teams in the nation (339th in points per game, 321st in field goal percentage, 336th in assist to turnover ratio). The Bearcats also lost Nick Madray, another 6-foot-9 big man with a sweet outside shot, as well as forward Magnus Richards, who never quite lived up to his billing as an athletic frontcourt player. Both transferred. \nPerovic gives the Bearcats size, versatility and a proven scorer. His presence should create lanes for slashers Willie Rodriguez (11.8 points per game), Romello Walker (8.6 ppg) and Justin McFadden (6.8 ppg). The Bearcats can use anything and everything that will make their offense run more smoothly. \n“Bobby (Ahearn) did a terrific job of battling, but he is undersized and it is nice now where when Bobby is in there he has a couple 6-9 guys in there with him,” Bearcats head coach Tommy Dempsey said. “It makes a difference on the perimeter because before (Perovic) got hurt he was arguably our best shooter too. That was an area where we really struggled throughout the season, shooting the basketball. \n“Quickly even in the preseason practices, there’s more shots going in. There’s more points being scored. When he was playing, he was our leading scorer. Anytime you’re a team that struggled to score, it’s nice to get your leading scorer back.” \nDempsey expects Perovic to be 100 percent by the season opener. Bearcats fans have to hope he can be the same type of inside-out threat he showed flashes of last season. \nBEARCATS 2014-15 \nOffensive Statistics \nPoints per game: 57.7 (eighth of nine in America East, 339 of 345 in NCAA Div.
