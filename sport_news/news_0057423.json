Texas Southern tied it after a fumble on a punt return set up a short field for Brad Woodard’s 2-yard run. \nSouthern’s first offensive drive resulted in a 3-yard touchdown run by Tillery, and he added another - a 2-yard plunge - to put the Jaguars up 21-7 with 1:55 left in the first quarter. \nTexas Southern (3-4, 2-4) responded, as Larry Clark III’s 54-yard touchdown catch and Malik Cross’ 18-yarder tied the game at 21 at halftime. \nIn the third, Southern added a short field goal by Gregg Pittman, and a blocked punt resulted in a safety. Touchdown runs by Deonte Shorts and John West iced the win. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:26:31.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
