Quarterback Evan Luhrsen kicked things off with a 65-yard scoring toss to Tanner Campbell just 1 minute, 11 seconds into the opening quarter. Hayden Van Winkle followed with touchdown runs of 88 and 23 before Luhrsen closed out a 28-point first quarter with a 46-yard connection to Easton Page. \nThe signal caller added a 48-yard touchdown run, and Zack Spady scored from 4 out as Belgrade amassed a 42-0 cushion at intermission. \nGunnar Lund and Alex Chidester scored on short runs down the stretch, and Jordan Shockley returned a fumble 20 yards to the end zone. \nDalton Walker scored on a 1-yard plunge with 4:32 remaining for Park, which was held scoreless for the first three quarters for a second consecutive. The Rangers finished with one win in Bruce Knerr's first season at the helm. \nJEFFERSON 23, MANHATTAN 15: The Tigers' normally high-flying offense was grounded Friday night in Boulder, and it cost Manhattan a conference championship. \nJefferson claimed the District 5B crown. The Panthers did it by holding Chris Grabowska’s team to just a field goal through the first three quarters, and then withstanding two fourth-quarter scores. \nThe loss is Manhattan’s first, and came at the hands of a Jefferson defense that allowed 42 points to Fairfield earlier in the season, but otherwise was holding opponents to less than a touchdown per game. \nDespite a second-place finish, the Tigers should still host a playoff game. \nNo statistics were available by press time, and head coach Chris Grabowska did not return a call seeking comment. \nTWIN BRIDGES 35, ENNIS 30: Bill Yeager shook free for 30- and 40-yard touchdown scampers in the second half, the last with 1 minute, 53 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to give the Falcons a 35-24 advantage, enough of a cushion to stave off a Mustangs rally and clinch a Southern C championship. \nEnnis (7-1) outscored opponents 406-70 entering Friday's battle of unbeatens, and its closest game was a 42-point decision. It mustered just six points in the first half, however, and trailed 28-12 with 3:21 in the third. \nThe Mustangs battled back, pulling to within four at 28-24 with 5:26 remaining. Yeager's score rendered an Ennis touchdown with 1:18 to play inconsequential. \nThe Mustangs are still slated to host a first-round playoff game next week. \nComplete statistics were available by press time, and Ennis head coach Chris Hess did not return a call seeking comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:23:41.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
