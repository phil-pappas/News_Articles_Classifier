Related Links Defense keys Coal City football win over Streator \nQuarterback Nick Micetich rolled out and took off for an eight-yard touchdown run that broke a scoreless tie more than halfway through the second quarter. The Coalers needed all of two plays to score again after forcing a Streator punt, as Nick Hayden broke off a 27-yard touchdown run. \nStreator scored late in the half to return it to a one-possession game, but a Hayden 17-yard carry to the end zone late in the third quarter started the transformation of the game into a rout. A Danny Kroeger interception on the first play of the fourth quarter led to a Joe Starkey 3-yard touchdown run, and a Brad Littleton pick was followed by another Hayden score from one yard out. Starkey followed a long Bulldog touchdown run with yet another score as time wound down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:49:35.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
