Does a 41-year old Terrell Owens still have what it takes to make another run in the NFL?\nAdChoices Owens has no doubt about it, and his target team would be the Philadelphia Eagles. When asked if he could help the sad state of the 1-3 Philly team, he didn’t hesitate to respond positively.\n“Absolutely, yes,” Owens told the 94WIP Mike & Ike Show on Friday. “No question, no question about that sir.”\nThe Philadelphia Eagles sit at the bottom of the NFC East so far this season, and they currently rank third-highest in dropped passes . That’s not a proud stat for Chip Kelly and crew to boast about.\nAdditionally, the Eagles have lost the second-most air yards due to all of the dropped passes, according to Pro Football Focus .\nMost air yards lost due to drops so far: 1. C Newton (139) 2. S Bradford (133) 3. B Bortles (118) 4. R Mallett (112) 5. C Palmer (92)\n— Pro Football Focus (@PFF) October 8, 2015\nConcerning the Eagles current woes, could adding a former All-Pro receiver such as Owens really make matters any worse?\nOwens further discussed his age for which he doesn’t see as a problem.\n“You think that I shouldn’t be playing right now?” Owens said. “I definitely could be playing right now, but based on my character — yeah, people can say, ‘Oh, he’s 41.’\n“But I’m not your average 41-year-old … And when I was on that football field, I felt like I was the best thing out there and it was due to how hungry I was and how dedicated I was.”\nIt’s highly unlikely we’ll be seeing the future Hall of Famer, who spent two seasons with the Eagles in 2005-2005, suiting up in Eagles green this season. However, Owens’ stories and his pie-in-the-sky dreams are always entertaining to listen to which is why he was currently spotlighted on NFL Network’s “ A Football Life .”\nAs for the Eagles, they’re somewhat of a mess right now and there is much work to do starting with Sam Bradford and his receivers, who have a total of 10 dropped passes so far this season. And, let’s not even get started on Philly’s third-worst ranked rush attack.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/PFF/status/652171341324513280", "https://twitter.com/PFF/status/652171341324513280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000553478/article/terrell-owens-i-could-absolutely-help-eagles-right-now", "http://www.sportingcharts.com/nfl/stats/team-receiver-drops-percentage/2015/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2015/10/09/terrell-owens-eagles-now/"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:41:59.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
