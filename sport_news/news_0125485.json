Sports Editor Ed Petruska previews tonight’s high school football games. Coronado at Casa Grande Union Over the last five weeks, the Cougars have feasted on opponents with a combined record of 5-27. With the No. 14 ranking in Division IV, an offense that averages 47.7 points and a defense that is allowing 10.7, CG Union (5-1) is going to find out if those impressive numbers are an accurate reflection of the team’s ability. Coronado also has won five in a row after a season-opening loss. The No. 13 Dons average 37.7 points while allowing 15.3. Their wins have come against opponents with a combined record of 7-25. “It’s going to be a see-how-far-we’ve-come game,” CG Union coach Jake Barro said. “We have to realize there are going to be bumps in the road. We need to be patient and stick to the plan, not get away from doing the things we do well.” Minimizing mistakes is essential. “We can’t have turnovers because they’ll make us pay if we give them extra possessions,” Barro said. Both teams are 1-0 in Section 5. The Cougars defeated Fountain Hills 35-0 last week, and Coronado posted a 38-20 win over Coolidge. The offenses are quite similar production-wise. CG Union averages 434 total yards (142 rushing, 292 passing) and the Dons average 377 (168 rushing, 209 passing). Barro said Coronado has more speed than any opponent the Cougars have faced this season, along with the “best defensive backs” and a big defensive line. The Dons will be going up against a CG Union defense that has held its previous five opponents to 14 or fewer points. The Cougars are allowing just 181 total yards (127 rushing, 54 passing). CG Union quarterback Brock Hall has thrown for 1,655 yards with 19 touchdowns and four interceptions. His primary receivers are Trevor Russell (31 catches, 20.9 average, 11 TDs), Cameron Gardner (19 receptions, 22.8 average, six TDs), Damien Estrada (12 catches, 19.1 average, one TD) and Taylor Dickerson (11 receptions, 16.1 average, two TDs). Trenton Diaz rushed for 117 yards last week. He averages 7.7 per carry and has six touchdowns. Coronado quarterback Jay Vanderjagt has thrown for 1,233 yards with 17 touchdowns and one interception. Braden Pixley-Green averages 24.6 yards on 17 catches with six TDs, Demonte Jackson averages 17.9 yards on 12 receptions with three TDs, and Braulio Aguilar averages 15.4 yards on 18 catches with three TDs. Victor Caison-Washington has rushed for 517 yards (7.1 per carry) and four TDs. Tempe at Vista Grande The Spartans climbed three spots to No. 9 in the Division III rankings following last week’s 37-6 nonsection victory over Flagstaff. They will look to keep the momentum rolling against the dangerous Buffaloes, who are 2-4 but coming off a 21-14 upset of No. 13 Arcadia. Vista Grande coach Tracy Stuart said Tempe can’t be taken lightly, and he’s confident the Spartans (5-1, 1-1 Section 1) will be ready to play. “The guys know it’s a battle every week,” he said. “They know football is a game of four full quarters. We go into games confident, but we’re not overconfident.” Beating the Buffaloes (1-1 section) will require another effective mesh of offense, defense and special teams, Stuart said. The Spartans excelled in all three phases against Flagstaff, which was ranked No. 18 going in. “We have to limit our mistakes and take advantage of our opportunities (on offense). We have to get pressure from the defensive front and great coverage in the secondary,” and special teams will be “critical” in determining the battle for field position, he said. The Spartans’ point total last week was a season high, as were their 375 total yards. Sophomore quarterback Sam Barragon passed for 238 yards and three touchdowns, including a 91-yarder to Nik Halter and a 47-yarder to Daniel Padilla. Barragon has completed 59 percent of his passes for 410 yards with five touchdowns and two interceptions. Vista Grande averages 21.7 points and 291 total yards (171 rushing, 120 passing). Luis Palacios is a multi-pronged threat for the Spartans. He returned a punt 75 yards for a TD last week, had a 52-yard kickoff return and scored on a 4-yard run. He has six of Vista Grande’s 18 touchdowns, including three rushing and two receiving. Brenden Ethington averages 17.6 yards on nine catches with one TD, and Padilla’s 313 rushing yards rank second to Palacios’ 358. Padilla has scored two touchdowns. Alec Meza, who scored on a 75-yard run in the season opener against Casa Grande Union, led the Spartans in rushing against Flagstaff with 62 yards on eight carries. Vista Grande’s defense is allowing 13.2 points and 199 total yards (84 rushing, 115 passing). Tempe’s offense averages 15.0 points. The Buffaloes “are very athletic at the skill positions,” which makes them capable of a quick strike, Stuart said. Although Tempe is allowing 22.8 points per game, “they’re big and they run to the football very well,” he said. Arcadia at Maricopa The Rams have risen to No. 3 in the Division III rankings despite a drop in point production. After averaging 53.5 points in its first four games, Maricopa was limited to 52 in wins over Tempe (33-7) and McClintock (19-10). Churning out yards has not been a problem, however. The Rams had 416 total in last week’s victory over the Chargers that raised their record to 6-0 overall and 3-0 in Section 1, rushing for 299. Johnny Johnson gained 118 on 11 carries, and Isaiah Pedro had 105 yards and two touchdowns on 12 attempts after replacing Aaron Owens at quarterback. Trailing 10-7 at halftime after committing three turnovers, Maricopa outscored McClintock 12-0 in the final two periods. Maricopa averages 44.3 points and 470 total yards (215 rushing, 255 passing). The Rams have rushed for 17 TDs and passed for 16. “We don’t really look to stay balanced,” Maricopa coach Chris McDonald said. “We just want to move the chains by taking what the defense gives us.” Maricopa has been on fall break this week, which concerns McDonald because the players are not in their normal routine. Arcadia is ranked No. 13 despite last week’s 21-14 loss to Tempe. The Titans (4-2, 1-1) average 26.0 points and 247 total yards (111 rushing, 136 passing) while allowing 26.7 points. “It’s probably the worst time to face a team like Arcadia, which is going to give us their best shot,” he said. Because the Titans already have two losses, “it’s survival or die” for their playoff hopes, McDonald said. Owens has 1,180 passing yards on the season with 12 touchdowns and three interceptions. His main receivers are Johnson (37 catches, 17.0 average, seven TDs), Pedro (27 receptions, 11.7 average, three TDs) and David Owens (19 catches, 20.4 average, six TDs). Cameron Sanders has five rushing touchdowns and Maverick Ingram has four. Arcadia quarterback Luke Ashworth has thrown for 814 yards with seven touchdowns and five interceptions. Riley Erickson averages 11.9 yards on 26 receptions with two TDs, and Ryan Alexandre has rushed for 634 yards (6.0 average) and eight TDs. Santa Cruz at American Leadership This intriguing Division V/Section 8 game in Queen Creek will pit top-echelon offenses against stingy defenses. The second-ranked Patriots (6-0, 2-0 section) average 38.5 points and 461 total yards (271 rushing, 190 passing) while allowing 13.5 points. Santa Cruz (5-1, 2-0) has scored 40 or more points in all but one game and shut out two opponents. The No. 14 Dust Devils average 47.7 points while allowing 11.5. “We’re getting to the point where we’re barely making any mistakes (on offense),” Santa Cruz coach Rishard Davis said. “We’re making our blocks and we’ve been able to execute everything in the playbook.” The Dust Devils defeated Veritas 68-0 last week, scoring on every possession until taking a knee on their final series. Devin Neal returned a punt 62 yards for a touchdown and scored on a 28-yard run, one of eight rushing TDs for Santa Cruz. Tony Jimenez caught a 43-yard touchdown pass from Emilio Cosillos, Andres Coronado had a 66-yard TD run, and Jesus Cosillos ran 46 yards for a touchdown. American Leadership has a Grade A running back in Jeremiah Boyd, who has rushed for 1,086 yards and 16 touchdowns. Boyd averages 11.0 yards per carry. The Eagles have scored 24 rushing TDs and 11 via the pass. Their leading receivers are Bujon Boyd (22 catches, 13.4 average, three TDs) and Haiden Stowers (21 receptions, 14.4 average, three TDs). Keeping American Leadership in check will require “real discipline on defense,” Davis said. “We have to read our keys, and everybody has to do their individual job instead of trying to make plays all over the field. The guys have to trust their teammates.” The Patriots stayed undefeated with a 35-12 victory over Division III Gila Ridge last week. Fountain Hills at Florence Only two Division IV teams have played a tougher schedule than the Gophers, according to the AIA rankings — No. 10 Combs, which defeated Florence 9-6 last week, and Fountain Hills. Despite being 2-4 with four consecutive losses, the season is far from over for the Gophers. They are ranked No. 20 and still have Section 5 games against No. 14 Casa Grande Union and No. 13 Coronado. But first Florence has to get past the Falcons (1-5, 0-1). “They’ve had a tough schedule in their own right, and we can’t overlook them at all,” Florence coach Scott Howard said. Lack of execution in the red zone has been a killer for the Gophers since they opened the season with wins over Page (54-0) and Apache Junction (39-6). Florence scored 33 points in a 31-point loss to No. 2 Show Low, but was held to zero points during regulation in a 15-14 double-overtime loss to No. 11 Blue Ridge. Next came a 20-12 loss to No. 6 Snowflake. In each of their last three games, the Gophers have been plagued by turnovers, penalties and dropped passes when moving inside the opponents’ 20-yard line, Howard said. Florence had two turnovers against Combs, gave up two points on a safety and failed to score after recovering a fumble at the Combs 24. The Gophers average 23.6 points while allowing 19.0. Fountain Hills lost 35-0 to CG Union last week. The Falcons average 9.0 points and 185 total yards (71 rushing, 114 passing) while allowing 37.5 points. Quarterback Derek Weinreich has thrown for 635 yards with four touchdowns and six interceptions, and Ian Mackiewicz averages 14.5 yards on 18 catches with one TD. Coolidge at Combs With Thomas Steffen Jr. back on the field, the Bears posted their second-highest point total of the season in last week’s 38-20 loss to Coronado, which is ranked No. 13 in Division IV. Steffen missed the previous four games due to injury after rushing for 224 yards and three touchdowns in a season-opening 35-21 victory over Amphitheater. He ran for two TDs against Coronado, but Coolidge never threatened after falling behind 31-0 while committing three turnovers. Trenton Davis scored the other touchdown for the Bears (1-5, 0-1 Division IV/Section 5), whose losses have come against teams with a combined record of 26-4. Coolidge averages 19.5 points while allowing 36.0. Combs is ranked No. 10 despite being 3-3 overall. The Coyotes edged Florence 9-6 in last week’s section opener and average 22.0 points and 301 total yards (200 rushing, 101 passing) while allowing 24.3 points. Erick Guerra has rushed for 483 yards (5.8 per carry) and six touchdowns. Ethan Hunt has five rushing TDs. Other games -- Mission Heights at West Phoenix The Phantoms (1-5) have lost three straight. West Phoenix has an 0-5 record following last week’s 72-34 loss to Heritage Laveen. Mission Heights, which was off last week, averages 11.8 points while allowing 38.3. The Eagles average 23.6 points while allowing 54.4. -- San Tan Foothills at Morenci San Tan Foothills upset Globe 28-7 last week and has risen to No. 16 in the Division V rankings. The Sabercats are 3-3 overall and 1-0 in Section 6. They average 20.5 points while allowing 35.2. Morenci is coming off a 40-32 loss to Miami. The No. 19 Wildcats (3-3, 0-1) average 32.0 points while allowing 26.2. -- Poston Butte at Canyon del Oro Poston Butte fell to 0-6 with last week’s 24-14 loss to Corona del Sol, ranked No. 12 in Division II. This is the Section 3 opener for the Broncos, who average 16.5 points while allowing 34.7. Canyon del Oro (1-5, 0-1) lost 46-28 to Ironwood Ridge. The Dorados average 31.5 points while allowing 34.7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:39:59.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
