In 2013, Pittsburgh took part in postseason baseball for the first time in 21 years and beat the Reds , 6–2, with the home crowd rattling Cincinnati starter Johnny Cueto , who gave up four runs in just 3 1/2 innings of work. Last year, the Pirates ran into the buzzsaw of postseason cyborg Madison Bumgarner , who shut them out on four hits in an 8–0 win. The postseason is no longer a novelty in Pittsburgh, and having won 98 games, the second most in the majors this season and as many as any other Pirates team since 1909, the Bucs will not be satisfied with a one-and-done performance.\nThe Cubs, meanwhile, are appearing in their first postseason since 2008, having arrived a year ahead of schedule according to most prognostications. Chicago didn’t back into this game, however. The team's 97 wins were the third-most in the majors this year; no Cubs team has won more since the 1935 squad that lost to the Tigers in the World Series. The Cubs might be more satisfied with simply having made it this far, but their expectations of advancing past this game should be every bit as great, if not moreso.\n• MORE MLB: Full postseason schedule, start times, TV listings\nMatchups: The 800-pound gorilla in this game is Arrieta, who is in the middle of one of the most dominant stretches of pitching in major league history. Arrieta enters this game with an active 22-inning scoreless streak and has not allowed a run in his last three starts, including one against the Pirates in which he held them to two base runners ( Gregory Polanco on a single and Andrew McCutchen on a hit-by-pitch) and struck out nine over seven innings. The last run Arrieta allowed, in fact, came in Pittsburgh back on Sept. 16; he gave up two runs, one earned, over eight frames.\nThe Cauldron Video NL wild-card game preview: Can the Pirates solve Jake Arrieta? by Katie Sharp", "external_links": ["http://m.cubs.mlb.com/news/article/153569652/cubs-set-wild-card-game-roster?partnerId=as_chc_20151007_53621366&adbid=651790365356199940&adbpl=tw&adbpr=41144996", "https://twitter.com/Pirates/status/651769933517340672", "http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:27:01.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
