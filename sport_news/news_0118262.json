He said former U of L director of basketball operations Andre McGee has denied underwriting sex parties for players, recruits and their fathers – a denial repeated by McGee’s attorney – but his somber tone and weary expression underscored the gravity of the allegations and Pitino’s inability to dismiss them out of hand.\n“To say I’m disheartened, disappointed would be probably the biggest understatement since I’ve been a coach.” Pitino said during a hastily called news conference on campus. “... My heart has just been taken out of my body and broken.”\nUSA TODAY\nBook claims U of L arranged for prostitutes\nAnd it figures to get worse before it gets better, possibly much worse. Powell’s book, which claims to be documented with photographs and text messages, vetted by investigators, scrutinized by lawyers and co-authored by Pulitzer Prize winner Dick Cady, would have to have passed a series of fairly comprehensive smell tests in order to get published. If the bulk of the book can be verified, U of L could be looking at a lengthy, agonizing NCAA investigation and a range of sanctions that could include probation, a loss of scholarships and vacated Final Four appearances.\nTo the extent this case echoes that of the University of Miami and its renegade booster, Nevin Shapiro, the investigative process could be as painful and more protracted than the penalties.\nThat the author admits to employing her own daughters in an escort service suggests a level of amorality and greed that would be hard for even the most cynical minds to comprehend. Yet though there are surely many more reputable sources than Katina Powell, her decision to sell a salacious story for a quick buck does not, of itself, contradict her claims.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nIU: We're not involved in Louisville escort scandal\nListening to Pitino Friday was like watching a man weighing evidence on the fly. He said his own inquiries of staff members past and present – McGee included – had turned up nothing to substantiate Powell’s story; and that the allegations were inconsistent with McGee’s previous role in the basketball program.\n“It just doesn’t make sense to me,” he said.\nPitino described McGee’s primary job as making sure players met their academic requirements, and that he would not have felt “pressure” to produce in recruiting.\nThough it’s possible McGee’s job was that narrowly defined, the importance of recruiting is lost on no one in big-time college athletics. LeRon Furr, a linebacker at Oklahoma State University during the 2009 and 2010 seasons, told Sports Illustrated that some of the school’s “hostesses” were having sex with recruits.\n“Those girls knew that they had to show the players a good time and get them (to commit to Oklahoma State),” Furr said. “Sex, going out, alcohol, smoking (marijuana).”\nIf some of those services were provided on a pro bono basis for the sake of school spirit, Powell says her operation netted more than $10,000 for 22 parties conducted between 2010 and 2014, many of them at Billy Minardi Hall, the players’ dorm.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nEx-U of L hoops staffer's lawyer slams book\n“I felt like I was part of the recruitment team,” Powell said in the book. “A lot of them players went to Louisville because of me.”\nThat boast will be difficult to prove, of course, but so, too, will be Pitino’s statement that “not one person came here because of those women.”\nPitino knows what he knows. There may well be things he'd rather not know.\nTim Sullivan can be reached at (502) 582-4650, tsullivan@courier-journal.com or @TimSullivan714 on Twitter.\nGet the CJ’s free UofL CardsHQ newsletter", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/060f5c99aa2c3603f19834c62bff1fd4e5a1fe15/c=745-54-2938-2247/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Louisville/Louisville/635794145641766576-AP-081130018963.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6914b0202639290d9fbf4485d93d9308ad4c206/c=0-54-1024-1078/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Louisville/Louisville/635794085157519096-CQWMHxpWwAE-fxE.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f0b70a11b541ece68fb37c1593d52bc114bfb90/c=0-0-1529-1529/local/-/media/2015/10/02/Indianapolis/Indianapolis/635794141576962198-SPOI-0330CardsState-132JU.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2015/10/02/report-u-l-looking-into-book-allegations/73228518/"], "published": "2015-10-03T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:00:18.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
