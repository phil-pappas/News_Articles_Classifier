Marcel Pourtout October 14, 2015 02:41 PM | 229 views | 0 | 0 | | Ben Franklin Academy in DeKalb County is the home of two elite youth fencers who have traveled the world competing in the sport. Sara Cunningham and Kamar Skeete, both members of the Nellya Fencers Club, represent the growing presence of young fencers in Atlanta.Cunningham, a junior, is in her first year at the academy. She is ranked 20th nationally in the women’s saber division for cadet (ages 16 and under), 40th in the junior division (ages 20 and under) and 49th in the senior division which is for all ages. Her interest in fencing started with a family member.“My brother started fencing and I would watch him,” Cunningham said. “One of the coaches encouraged me to start the sport and I’ve been doing it for eight years. I like how you have to connect mental skills with physical movement and anticipate what’s going to happen next.”Cunningham practices three to four times a week with each session lasting up to four hours each. She has traveled throughout the United States as well as Mexico, Poland, Germany and Hungary for competition and had a Division 1 “B” rating.Last month, Cunningham placed 38th out of 119 fencers in the Saber Cadet competition at the Konin European Cup in Poland. The United States finished second in the team event.“It’s good to compete against international fencers and see their styles,” Cunningham said.She finds many strong training partners and young competitors in Atlanta.“We have top-ranked fencers in the city and it’s fun competing with them,” Cunningham said.She plans to continue fencing at the collegiate level and nationally. She lists photography, government and math as her favorite subjects.Skeete is also a competitor in the saber division and currently ranks second in the nation for the Y14 men’s division. He’s a two-time winner of the USA Fencing’s National Rolling Points award, earning the title for Y10 in 2012 and Y12 in 2014.
