The Owls beat the Bulldogs 12-7 in their first Big South Conference game. KENNESAW — Kennesaw State won its first Big South Conference game Saturday with a 12-7 victory over Gardner-Webb at Fifth Third Bank Stadium, becoming the first football newcomer to do so since the Big South was established in 2002. Defensive lineman Nick Perrotta’s goal-line interception on fourth-and-goal with 3 seconds to play sealed the victory.“It’s a big deal, it’s a big deal, it’s a big deal,” Kennesaw State coach Brian Bohannon said. “I’ve tried to keep the kids quiet about it over the last three weeks because they like to get ahead of themselves, sometimes. Talk about laying a foundation, stuff that you can build on. Shoot, it’s a big deal. No two ways about it.”It wasn’t always pretty. Kennesaw State (5-1, 1-0) couldn’t find the end zone, despite totaling 353 yards of offense and getting 20 first downs, and had to settle for four Justin Thompson field goals. The Owls won the time-of-possession battle at 38:40 minutes, nearly twice as long as the Bulldogs’ 21:20.And they prevailed against a team that beat then-No. 15-ranked Liberty a week ago. “What a great win. Holy cow. First of all, I couldn’t be more proud of our football team,” Bohannon said. “You’re talking about a young football team playing their first conference game, playing a team that just upset a 15-ranked team and the Big South Champion, and our kids go out and fight tooth and nail. Talking about finding a way to win when your back’s against the wall.”Quarterback Trey White was the architect for Kennesaw State’s lengthy drives that all resulted in points. He rushed for 170 yards on 34 carries and was responsible for getting 16 of Kennesaw State’s 20 first downs.Kennesaw State’s longest scoring drive, 19 plays for 83 yards, started in the third quarter and carried over into the fourth, and it chewed more than 10 minutes off the clock. White converted four first downs during the marathon drive, and the Owls were facing fourth-and-one on the Gardner-Webb 5-yard line with every intention of going for it.But the Owls were called for a false start and came away with a Thompson 27-yard kick instead.“This was one of those games where we really had to grind it out and show that this is our coming-out party,” White said. “We didn’t punch it in to the end zone but we did enough to win.”Kennesaw State’s defense kept Gardner-Webb out of the end zone for the first three quarters while holding the Bulldogs to just 66 yards. The fourth quarter ended up being a different story.Gardner-Webb orchestrated a 10-play, 68-yard drive capped by a 1-yard touchdown by Josh Bettistea. The former Allatoona High School standout finished the game with 43 yards, with 33 coming on the touchdown drive.With just over 5:30 left to play in the game, Kennesaw State either needed to score or chew off more clock. The Owls ended up scoring on a Thompson 34-yard field goal to cap a drive that was highlighted by a 39-yard pass down the middle from White to Justin Sumpter, who had 70 yards on five catches.“It makes it a lot easier for me when I have guys fighting for me and I’m fighting for them,” White said. “Again, it was a total team win, and our defense stepped up huge.” With 1:44 still to play, which was enough time for Gardner-Webb to drive and score a touchdown, Kennesaw State’s defense denied them the end zone. The Bulldogs threatened when Tyrell Maxwell completed a 22-yard pass to Jacob Henderson on fourth-and-10 to put them on the Kennesaw State 6 with less than 15 seconds left. Gardner-Webb managed to get just two yards on the next three plays, which was a two-yard pass to Henderson on second down. Maxwell threw into the end zone, but was dropped by Bobby Clark before his fourth down attempt was intercepted by Perrotta. It was Perrotta’s second interception of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:42:23.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
