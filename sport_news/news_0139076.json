Photo: Katherine Single Researchers at Karolinska Institutet and University of Stockholm examined 5.5 million Swedish men and women and found a correlation between height and cancer. For every 10 centimeters (4 inches) of height, a woman’s risk of developing cancer increased by 18% and a man’s by 11%, the study showed.\nTaller women had a 20% greater risk of developing breast cancer than shorter women and both men and women’s risk of suffering melanoma, a type of skin cancer, increased by about 30% for every 10 centimeters of height.\nThe study, presented at the annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology meeting in Barcelona on Friday, proves an association but not a cause-and-effect relationship. Still, researchers say the study—the largest of its kind—adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting a linkage between height and cancer and underscores the importance of identifying why the relationship exits.\n“Identifying potential risk factors for cancer can help us understand the mechanisms for how cancer develops and that might be used to develop treatments,” said Dr. Emelie Benyi, a researcher at Karolinska Institutet who led the study.\nPrevious studies conducted on a smaller scale have also shown the same association.\nDr. Benyi said there may a number of plausible explanations. Taller people have more cells that could mutate into tumors and are likely exposed to higher levels of growth hormones during adolescence that could trigger cancer. Another reason may be that taller individuals eat more and previous studies link a high intake of calories to cancer, she said.\nCancer is one of the leading causes of death world-wide, with nearly 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths in 2012, according to the World Health Organization. Height is determined by genetic factors and growth hormone levels but also environmental influences including diet and infections in childhood.\nRelated\nA Blood Test for Early Cancer Detection Sparks Debate Gene Test Helps Some Breast-Cancer Patients Skip Chemo, Study Says Dr. Benyi noted cancer may be the result of a number of factors and that height alone wasn’t a precursor to cancer on the individual level. “I don’t think tall people need to be worried. There are many other factors that you can influence and that are likely to be more important,” she said.\nThe researchers in Stockholm collected data from medical, conscription, passport and cancer registries, and followed adults with heights ranging from 1 meter to 2.25 meters. The people examined were born between 1939 and 1991 and followed from 1958 or the age of 20 until the end of 2011, researchers said. The group will next examine if tall people are also at greater risk of dying from cancer than shorter peers or have an increased mortality overall, Dr. Benyi said.\nWrite to Anna Molin at anna.molin@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO641_1001ca_FR_20151001113713.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:55:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
