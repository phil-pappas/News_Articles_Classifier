The new security measure, mandated by the NBA during the annual NBA security meetings, will remain a standard operating procedure at all Memphis Grizzlies games, including the entire preseason and postseason, and at all NBA teams’ arenas. The walk-through metal detectors will enhance security and replace hand-held devices as the primary tool at FedExForum. The detectors are a more effective and less intrusive form of screening and will help to expedite security measures for all Memphis Grizzlies games. Fans are highly encouraged to arrive at all Grizzlies games early to prevent any delays entering FedExForum. “This new NBA policy is in line with what has become an industry standard across MLB, NHL and NFL venues, and we’re happy to comply with any enhancement aimed at improving convenience and safety,” said FedExForum Vice President of Arena Operations Eric Granger. “We thank our guests in advance for their patience and strongly encourage planning ahead to allow adequate time for entry.” FedExForum guests are advised to bring only necessary items to the games to help expedite screenings. Separate express lanes will be available for guests in the Grand Lobby without bags to be inspected. FedExForum guests will not need to remove their hats, shoes, belts, watches or jewelry as with airport security . Instead, guests will have to place their cell phones, cameras and keys on a security table prior to walking through the metal detector. Expectant mothers and ADA guests are not subject to the magnetometers and will instead be screened through handheld devices. Media will continue to enter FedExForum through the Media Entrance on Martin Luther King, Jr. Ave. where they will be subject to screening and bag inspections as well.
