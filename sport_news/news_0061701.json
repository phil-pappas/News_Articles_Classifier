Lincolnville (11-1-1) earned the postseason championship plague. \nIronically, the deciding goal in the championship game came from Thibeault, who also was the boys winner in the league cross-country championship seven days earlier. \nKris Kelly added an insurance goal on a penalty kick late in the second half for the Lynx. Thibeault scored early in the first half, off an assist by Kelly. \nMatt Kremin played in goal for the Lynx and Josh Pearse in net for the Hawks. \nHope had won 3-2 in the lone regular-season contest with Lincolnville. \nThe Lynx, coached by Ben Edes and Paul Russo, include Tristan Black, Sam Luft, Hope Osgood, Joey LcChance, Hayden Thibeault, Eric Andrews, Paige Chester, Hanna Hallundbaek, Rowan Hurlburt, Owen Markowitz, Wyatt Munson, Jack Fishman, Cole Freeman, Matt Kremin, Kasey Wood, Lulu Lydon and Kristina Kelly. A handful of these players also were members of the school's cross-country squad. \nHope, coached by Maxwell Niles, includes Emma Mitchell, Adam Thorndike, Maggie Blemaster, Jordan Cote, Sylvan Eichenlaub, Sam Gallagher, Taylor Westbrook, Ella Pierce, Noah Quesnel, Josh Pearse, Owen Power, Kendra Merrill, Kieran McGrath, Abbi Dodd, Francis Ostenson, Charlie Griebel, Evie Bracher, Elsa Chandler and Jordan Overlock. \nEdes said the \"weather gods were kind to both the Hope Hawks and the Lincolnville Lynx as a drenching shower literally held off until just a minute after the final whistle allowing\" both teams to battle for the championship on a dry field. \nThe Lynx controlled play for much of the game, especially in the second half. \nIt was 1-0 until the 54-minute and Kelly's penalty kick goal put the exclamation point on the Lincolnville victory. To that point, the Hawks fought hard in an attempt to score the equalizer. \n\"Both teams started seriously right from the first whistle with neither team gaining an advantage,\" Edes said. \"In fact, early in the game the Hawks had a brilliant [scoring] chance as they bounced a header off the LCS crossbar. But then the Lynx defense firmed up and from then on out managed to turn the vast majority of Hope’s efforts aside before they got clearly into scoring distance.\" \nThe scoring was initiated, as it has been often for Lincolnville, by the team’s exceptional midfielder Kelly. She stole the ball in the Lynx defensive zone, carried it forward, blew by a Hope defender just over midfield and sent a \"gorgeous\" through pass to striker Thibeault. Thibeault fielded the ball cleanly on the run, left the Hawk defense in his dust and went in alone, finishing with a shot to his right that nestled inside the post. \nLincolnville continued to dominate play for the rest of the first half and into the second half, allowing Hope few opportunities to get even. \nThe Lynx insurance goal came with six minutes left when Kelly was tripped in the Hope goal box. Kelly calmly teed up the penalty kick and sent it firmly to her right to cleanly beat the keeper. \nLincolnville was able to hold on for the final four minutes as the Hawks put everything they had into an attempt to catch up. \n\"Kelly’s play, spectacular throughout the season in terms of skills, tactical knowledge, and leadership, cannot be too highly praised,\" Edes said. \"She exerted a major positive influence on her teammates and was the dominant player in every game she played. \nWith two points in her final middle school game, Kelly ended the season with 17 goals and 15 assists, to give her 32 points, which puts her second in the school's single-season assists and fourth on the single-season scoring list. \nIn addition, Kelly ended third in every Lynx three-year career scoring category — with 33 goals and 24 assists for 57 points. \n\"Finally, she established a near-perfect conversion record for penalty kicks for the year, not an easy thing to do for middle school players,\" Edes said. \"Kelly is not only the best female player ever to play for Lincolnville, she is one of the four-best players — regardless of gender — ever to wear the LCS white.\" \nEdes said Kremin recorded his sixth shutout of the season and Thibeault \"played his usual hustling style up front ... Winger Tristan Black came up with his finest performance of the year and winger Jack Fishman played a major role in keeping the intense pressure on the Hawks. To either side of Kelly were midfielders Sam Luft and Eric Andrews helping her to dominate the midfield zone. Finally there were the defenders, Owen Markowitz, Lulu Lydon, Kasey Wood and Wyatt Munson, who played a very strong containment game that allowed few solid goal tries, and also played a major role in keeping the ball up in the Hawks' defensive end for so much of the game. As one of the referees said after the game, the LCS defense was rock solid. As a result, the win was truly a team victory that every player has reason to be proud of.\" \nEarlier in the single-elimination postseason tournament, in the prelims, No. 6 St. George defeated No. 11 Troy Howard of Belfast, No. 7 Vinalhaven beat No. 10 Nobleboro and No. 8 Camden-Rockport beat No. 9 South Bristol. \nIn quarterfinal play, No. 3 Appleton knocked out No. 6 St. George, No. 4 Jefferson defeated No. 5 Bristol, top-seeded Hope beat No. 8 Camden-Rockport and No. 2 Lincolnville bested No. 7 Vinalhaven. \nThen in a pair of semifinal playoff games on Tuesday, Oct. 20, No. 1 Hope defeated No. 4 Jefferson, while No. 2 Lincolnville picked up a win over No. 3 Appleton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:35:13.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
