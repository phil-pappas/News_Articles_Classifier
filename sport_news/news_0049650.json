Allen scored a second-half goal as the Vikings defeated the Maroons 6-1. Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015 6:00 am \nDANVILLE — Coaches are always asking for 100 percent effort from their athletes. \nDanville soccer coach Chris Griffin got that a little bit more from his Vikings this season. \nNot only did they post a 6-1 victory over the Champaign Central Maroons on Kickin’ Cancer for Myles Senior Night, but they easily surpassed their fund-raising goals. \n“Outstanding night all around,’’ Griffin said. “I was glad to see the perform on the field like they did with the fund-raising efforts. \n“I’m real proud of their effort both on and off the pitch.’’ \nDanville set a goal of raising $10,000 and at halftime, the team presented a check written out for $11,686. 87. \n“We did it all for Myles,’’ said Danville senior Jordan Allen. “We came out here and worked as hard as we could. \n“It means a lot, because it took a commitment by the whole team. We went out and sold shirts. We went a $1,000 over it, almost $2,000.” \nAnd just as impressive was their play on the pitch at Ned Whitesell Field. Danville scored three times in the first half and add three more goals in the second half en route to the Big 12 Conference victory over a long-time rival. \n“It was an important game, but we just need to take every game one step at a time,’’ said Danville senior keeper Kendl Gulick, noting that the Vikings and the Maroons could meet again for the IHSA Class 2A Mattoon Regional championship in two weeks. \n“This was for Myles tonight,’’ added Gulick, who was a little disappointed that Danville didn’t get a shutout. “We did what we did for him and for the team. He is an important part of this team.’’ \nGriffin acknowledged that he was a little concerned about how his team would handle all the senior night festivities along with the halftime check presentation. \n“To the boys credit, they did an outstanding job on the pitch in spite of all of the hoopla that went on today,’’ he said. “We talked about it. \n“We don’t lose on senior day and we are definitely not going to lose on our senior day when it is the cancer awareness game.’’ \nAllen admitted that he wanted to get a goal on senior night and he did. \nEarly in the second half, junior Ethan Norton, who had two goals, got one of his game-high three assists when he found Allen on a cross. \n“We got the win and that’s all that matters,’’ Allen said. “But, I was hoping to get a goal. \n“We are playing well and we are playing quick. Our transition has just been outstanding.’’ \nGriffin said the team wanted to put on a good show for the largest crowd he has ever seen for a soccer match at Danville High School. \n“I’ve seen a lot of matches here and this was just awesome,’’ he said. “We wanted to give everyone a good reason to keep supporting us as we play the regional tournament in Mattoon, and if we can advance the sectional tournament in Urbana. \n“We had tremendous support last year and we are hoping for more of the same this year.’’ \nAnd how about the play for Norton? \n“Ethan has been outstanding, all year long,’’ Griffin said. “He wanted to play center back, and he is an exceptional center back, but I told him that I have guys that I can put back there but I don’t have guys that can score like you can. \n“I was more proud of the effort he made on Jordan’s goal. He ran 60 yards on an diagonal to battle one of their guys. He kept the ball in bounds and plays a first time ball back into the middle of the field. When we play fast, we are really good.’’ \nDanville (14-4-2 overall and 8-1 in the Big 12 Conference) will conclude its regular season next Tuesday at Normal Community.
