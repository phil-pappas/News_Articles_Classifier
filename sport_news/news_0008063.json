(AP) - In the summer after Isabella Emma Icatar completed first grade at Marvin Elementary School, her parents enrolled her in softball at the school. \nHer mother, Julianne Icatar, had some reservations given that Isabella had been diagnosed with cancer in 2008. But after undergoing treatment, Isabella had most of her strength back and wanted to play, her mother said. \nAnd play she did. \n“She was standing out in right field. A girl got up and made a huge hit - it was a line drive straight into the outfield, right at Isabella. No kid had hit it that far before. Isabella held out her glove, and lo and behold, caught that ball,” Julianne Icatar said. “As it was happening, you could hear all the parents gasp, and then when we realized she had caught it, everyone erupted in applause. I think Isabella herself was surprised she caught it! And that amazing catch was what everyone talked about for the next few weeks. Isabella beamed with pride!” \nUnfortunately, her rare form of brain cancer returned. Isabella Emma Icatar died Sept. 21, 2012. She was 9. \nIsabella’s love for Marvin Elementary School and her time playing softball there, however, will be memorialized forever, after the Common Council recently approved naming the field after her. \n“I’m just deeply humbled and just grateful at the thought of having Isabella’s memory live on for generations to come, long after I’m gone, and knowing that kids are going to be playing ball on the same field that she did. It’s just amazing,” Roneil Icatar, her father, said after the council approval. \nRoneil Icatar was joined at the council meeting by his wife, Julianne, and Isabella’s siblings, Nathaniel and Giancarlo. Nathaniel, who is 8 years old, uses Isabella’s old softball glove to play baseball. Louis Seeley of Norwalk Girls Softball Youth League was also present. He coached Isabella and was so impressed by her enthusiasm that he asked the city to name the field after her, according to Icatar. \nThe request passed unanimously through the council’s Land Use and Building Management Committee, and also its Recreational, Parks and Cultural Affairs Committee. \n“We’re really happy to do this for you and we’re sad that you lost your daughter,” said Councilman Richard J. Bonenfant, Land Use Committee chairman. “She went to Marvin School and she played softball on the field and our hearts go out to you.” \nCouncil President Jerry E. Petrini, parks committee chairman, said the Icatars spoke eloquently about their daughter before his committee. Naming the field after Isabella is only fitting, according to Petrini. \n“Your daughter touched a lot of people and I’m just so happy we could do this for your and your family and your daughter,” Petrini said. \nDirector of Recreation and Parks Michael A. Mocciae said either the softball league or the city will create the sign, which could be placed behind the field’s backstop. \nJulianne Icatar described her daughter as a joyful, happy, smiling and smart girl to whom other Marvin Elementary School children gravitated. \n“She could just walk down the hall, and kids would shout out and wave to her,” Julianne Icatar said. “She never lacked for someone wanting to be her ‘partner,’ carry things for her, or hold her hand, or stay and have indoor recess with her if she couldn’t go outside.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:56:28.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
