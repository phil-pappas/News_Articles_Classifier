While photographers are benefiting from the changes by increasing their efficiency and availability, consumers are now able to take professional-quality images without the need of a specialist. On a positive note, revenue is expected to improve in the next 5 years as operators focus on niche markets, such as events and sports photography, to sustain demand.\"\n“Selfies are all the rage nowadays and there is, in fact, an industry that is trying to grab on to this growing trends,” says Cattya Bella, Director of Product Development for World Patent Marketing Reviews. “Selfie sticks and other accessories that help in the making of a Selfie are becoming more and more popular. The SELFi is an app invention that takes regular self-pictures to a whole new level.”\nThe SELFI is an ingenious app invention that allows people to take self-pictures using a mirror and enables them to edit the picture on the fly to add messages or captions to it without having to type backwards. It has a list of preset messages written in reverse and can be added directly to the photo shot from the mirror. Once the image is flipped, the message will come out properly in the end. It is a fun way to personalize and customize self-pictures before sending it to friends or posting it on social media.\n“Everyone that has tried taking a selfie knows just how difficult it is to add a message or text to their photos as the message will come out backwards,” says inventor Stephen S. “SELFi has a list of easy to use preset messages that is perfect for any occasion, style, or mood. Since this app invention is available on various systems and platforms, anyone and everyone can use it with ease.”\nStefan Davis, a tech blogger from Marquette, MI, has this to say about the SELFi: “Smartphones have evolved through the years to meet the needs of consumers. The ability to take self-pictures is not a new idea but is something made even more convenient with the popularity of smartphones. SELFi is an app invention that not only makes this task easier and more beautiful, but it can also be used for other, more practical uses. With this app, a person can easily try out clothing, accessories, or a new pair of glasses, send photo to their friends, and ask for their opinion about it. It is an even easier way of connecting with people!”\nThe SELFi is an amazing app invention that allows people to be as creative and as unique as they want to when making self-pictures that they can then send to friends or post on social media.\nABOUT WORLD PATENT MARKETING\nWorld Patent Marketing is an innovation incubator and manufacturer of patented products for inventors and entrepreneurs.
