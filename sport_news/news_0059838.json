I definitely thought we had a chance [to win].\" \nDigital Harbor had an easier time winning its team title. Dash led the way as the Rams placed five runners in the top 15 overall and finished with 43 points to easily top runner-up Poly (74). \nCoach Lutalo Bakari said his team has been pointing toward running well in the city, region and state meets — the season's biggest races — throughout the fall. \n\"We know that this is the first of three hills,\" Bakari said. \"Now we'll prepare for the next one.\" \nDash trailed Edmondson's Frankye Duckett for much of the race before taking off with about 400 yards left. The junior finished in 17:35.17 to edge Duckett (17:40.07). \nDuckett led for much of this race but that didn't bother Dash. The junior simply wanted to stay within about 10 meters of Duckett so he'd be ready to make a late move. He did just that throughout the run, and everything then played out perfectly at the end. \n\"I knew exactly where to kick,\" Dash said. \"I was just trying to run smart. I was second the whole race. I tried to stay with him the whole time.\" \nTeammate Lyndon Burrell finished third. Marquise Hill (11th), Berkeley Todd (13th) and Criss Dzaringa (15th) rounded out the Digital Harbor top five as the Rams showed their depth. \nBaltimore City Championships \n(at Herring Run Park) \nBOYS \nTeam scores (top 5): 1.
