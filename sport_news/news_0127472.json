Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford has been afforded the luxury of misfiring more than most because of a defense and a culture that's held his team together. (Michael Perez / AP) Nick Fierro Contact Reporter Eagles culture club has helped squad from falling apart. \nWhen the Philadelphia Eagles last tried to turn their roster over the way coach Chip Kelly elected to this past offseason, it became the biggest reason the job became available to him in the first place. \nHis predecessor, Andy Reid, tried the same thing. Backfired so spectacularly that the players quit and two assistant coaches were fired. And who can forget cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha eating lunch in his car, which he needed to keep up with receivers by the time he arrived here. \nAs the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That sure looked to be the case after the first four weeks of this season, when the Eagles were sitting at 1-3 and not having much of a clue how to fit all their shiny new pieces together. \nTV analyst Brian Billick, who used to be an NFL coach (around 75 years ago) called them a \"powder keg ready to blow up.\" \nMeanwhile Kelly was (and is) rumored to be the leading candidate for every anticipated major college coaching vacancy out there, with him following the likes of Nick Saban and Bobby Petrino back to a comfort zone he can never enjoy in the NFL. \nBut the infamous collapse of 2012 will not be repeated this season, and Kelly isn't going anywhere anytime soon. \nFor all his shortcomings, perceived or real, even Kelly's harshest critics have to admit he's assembled a team that has character and will fight through adversity instead of running away from it. \nThis is what we have seen from the Eagles over the past two weeks, and it's a huge reason why they have worked their way into a tie for first place in the NFC East with the New York Giants. \n\"Our motto from I think Week 3 has just been take it one game at a time,\" quarterback Sam Bradford said. \"And that is kind of what we have done. We've won our last two at home, we won three of our last four and that's really how we are handling the rest of the season. \n\"Next week, we have a big one against Carolina and that is really all that we are concerned with right now.\" \nThey've won these games, the last two convincingly, with offensive issues that still haven't been fixed and may never be this season. But the Eagles will remain in contention the rest of the way because of their resiliency, their culture and, well, their circumstances. \nThe division they play in just isn't very good. This applies whether Tony Romo and Dez Bryant are healthy or disabled, as everyone who doesn't recognize this by now will by December. \nAnd now that the Eagles control their destiny again as midseason approaches, they're set up as well as anybody in the division to take it because they don't bring their misplays home with them. \nConversely, they do bring the big ones home. \n\"The line blocked better tonight on run plays,\" center Jason Kelce said after Monday night's 27-7 win over the Giants. \"Let's face it, we have to put a whole game together, we have to eliminate mistakes. It's good to have a 100-yard rusher like we did, but we had pre-snap penalties, I had the bad snap, there are still a lot of mistakes that fortunately, the defense is playing really well and keeping us in games. \n\"We are putting up yards, but if we don't get this corrected when we play better teams, it's going to hurt us bad.\" \nMaybe, but the Eagles will muddle through regardless because they have a defense that can carry them for the first time in a long time, while the offense with its new quarterback and new running backs and new guards and new wide receiver continues to get more in sync in search of that elusive complete game. \nAnd if you had to choose between a defective offense or a defective defense, you would be wise to choose offense all the time. \nOf course this team still has a lot of work to do. It probably has to win all the rest of its division games, starting with its rematch against the Dallas Cowboys on the road on Nov. 8. \nNow here's the best part: In addition to having two weeks to prepare, the Eagles head to Texas knowing the road team has won every game in this series since Kelly took over in 2013. \nExpect the Cowboys to get the Eagles' best shot, regardless of what might happen next Sunday night against the undefeated Carolina Panthers. \nThat's because of the way this team is constructed, to continue working together despite the pieces continuing to move in opposite directions for troubling stretches. \nThe feeling is that the offense will come around eventually because the defense will keep things from getting too chaotic to operate. \nWhether the Eagles get back to the playoffs this season remains a mystery that might not be solved until the final week. \nThe only certainty is that this collection of players and coaches will hold things together regardless. \nThere's no powder keg here, just a lot of new players trying to get in sync with the right amount of urgency and no reason to panic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:39:11.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
