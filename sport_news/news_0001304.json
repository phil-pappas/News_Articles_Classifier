(Photo: Matt Lombardo, Twitter) \nAs seen in the above photos, the Eagles used other team nicknames such as \"Falcons\" and \"Jets\", but did not refer to the \"Redskins\" by their name, using Washington instead. Matt Lombardo first tweeted the pictures of the media guides. \nThe stance the Eagles are taking is in direct reference to the Redskins' name change debate, which has gained national attention over the past few years with many calling for Washington's team to change their nickname due to racial concerns. \nLike this story?
