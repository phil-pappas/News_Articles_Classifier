Uber for drunk college kids.\nThat was the pitch for bringing Uber to upstate New York and Long Island from the app’s New York City manager Josh Mohrer during a radio interview with The Capitol Pressroom Tuesday.\nCollege students have petitioned to bring ride-share to their towns, saying “we don’t have options when we’re drunk and we want to have Uber here,” Mohrer said.\nUber and its smaller rideshare rival Lyft want legislation that would open the rest of New York to 21st-century car services by setting rules for insurance and third-party background checks.\nMohrer said that businesses have also been eager to see Uber roll outside of New York City to bring them customers.\nMohrer said Uber would complement local cab services, which he then trashed.\n“Often times, you call one and they don’t show up,” Mohrer said, bashing the current taxi options. “I think the existing system for a lot of people doesn’t work.”\nUnlike in the city, Uber and other app-based car services want to bring true ridesharing to upstate where people looking to make a quick buck or seeking full-time work can use their own cars to pick up passengers.\nSo far, more than 350,000 people in upstate New York have downloaded the app, even though it doesn’t exist there yet, according to Uber.\nMohrer joined state lawmakers and local business owners on Tuesday at the Capitol Building in Albany to tout the economic boost ridesharing can bring to the region. Uber is claiming that 13,000 jobs will be created and six million trips taken during the app’s first year of operation in the upstate region.\nLouis Lanzano/for New York Daily News College students have petitioned to bring ride-share to their towns, saying “we don’t have options when we’re drunk and we want to have Uber here,” Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber NYC, said. Lyft, known for its cars that sport a pink mustache, is also looking to hit the road in the upstate market after it peeled out of Buffalo and Rochester when state regulators sued the company, earning it a $300,000 fine.\n“The majority of states across the nation have passed laws that allow people to choose Lyft,” David Mack, Lyft’s public affairs director, said in a statement. “We hope these discussions lead to more transportation options and economic opportunity for all New Yorkers.”\nIn the city, Uber’s competitors in the taxi and for-hire car service industries have been fighting the expansion of ridesharing apps. Industry officials during a Monday roundtable with state lawmakers claimed that Uber and other cab apps would get to follow a lighter set of rules on safety and insurance requirements.\nBut Mohrer said it has rigorous insurance coverage requirements and background check system for drivers.\n“Riders ... aren’t going to get into cars if they don’t feel safe,” he said.\nDisability advocates who have demanded that Uber require wheelchair-accessible cars, meanwhile, want lawmakers to hit the brakes on the rideshare expansion.\nJames Weisman, president of the United Spinal Association, said Uber would be getting a “license to discriminate” if it was allowed upstate.\n“No rallies or reports can hide the fact that out of more than 30,000 Uber cars operating in the city, not a single one is wheelchair accessible,” Weisman said. “Allowing Uber to use only inaccessible vehicles upstate would perpetuate this discrimination and undermine government pledges to the disability community to expand accessible transportation options.”\nRelated Stories Uber rapist sentenced to 10-12 years in prison Uber drivers to receive Amber alerts under new partnership NYC taxis could get virtual meters, ditch TVs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:54:54.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
