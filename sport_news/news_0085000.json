Tied for second and third on the list were Kevin Durant and LeBron James, who each received 6.9% of the vote.\nThis is a pretty staggering change from last year, when James came out on top for this question, with 50% of GMs saying they’d want to build around the Cavaliers star.\nBut James is 30 years old, settling into the latter-half of his career. He’s still a dominant player (and the GMs’ pick for who they most feel will be MVP this year) but this question is about starting a franchise.\nDavis is 22 years old. He’s already an All-Star and will be first-team All Defense for the foreseeable future. He’s got a legit shot to win both NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year this year and, again, he’s only 22 years old.\nA lot of people expected Davis to make the leap, but I’m not sure anyone thought he would make it this soon. And for that reason, he’s the guy NBA GMs would want to build around.\nYou can see all the results of the poll over at NBA.com .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.nba.com/news/features/john_schuhmann/nba-com-2015-16-gm-survey/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpt3a"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:05:42.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
