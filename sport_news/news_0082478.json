But Kevin Anderson, who completed 29 of 36 passes for a career-high 377 yards and two touchdowns, took the Rams 51 yards in nine plays to pull out the win. \nRobbie Cantelli had career-highs of 12 catches for 164 yards for Fordham (5-1). \nBut with Brian Schoenauer running for 161 yards and three touchdowns, Penn (1-4) kept the pressure on. \nA week after running for a career-high 234 yards, Edmonds, a sophomore, moved into fifth on the school list with more than 2,700 yards and is second in touchdowns with 34.
