The Warhorses then answered back with a touchdown of their own, but the conversion failed to preserve the Avoyelles lead, 8-6. \n“It started off their way. They like to run right at you,” said Peabody head coach Benny Vault. “I knew we had to make a stop.” said Vault. “We made some adjustments defensively, and offensively we just had too much speed for them.” \nAvoyelles may have drawn first blood, but from there on out, Peabody could hardly be stopped and didn’t allow another Avoyelles touchdown until late in the 4th quarter, which by that time Peabody junior varsity players were surely getting their time in the spotlight on homecoming night. \n“Just too many mistakes,” said Avoyelles coach Andy Boone. “They had a lot more speed than us. We made too many mistakes and they didn’t make any.” \nThe Avoyelles offense was its usual self, throwing only three passes the whole night, totaling 250 offensive yards with 220 coming on the ground. \nFor Peabody, senior quarterback Sadrick “Wanya” Kirklin was also his usual self, having a good night passing, completing six of his seven passes for 169 yards and two touchdowns. \nMost of those passing statistics went to junior Jamar Washington who had an outstanding night receiving, catching three passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. \n“It was a great game for me and my team.” said Kirklin. \nPeabody junior running back Bruce Price continued to be a force in the ground game, toting the rock 11 times, gaining 94 yards and scoring three touchdowns. The Peabody defense was also exceptional, led by junior linebacker Justin Richard with 12 tackles and sophomore Kaderion Ellis who had a 53-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown in the second half. \nThe Warhorses already have their eyes on something bigger than district titles. They have their eyes set on the big prize — a Class 3A title. \n“From here on out, every step forward is one step closer to Dec. 12, which is the state championship game.” said Kirklin. \nNext week, the Warhorses (2-3 overall, 1-1 District 3-3A) will travel down the road to take on the winless Bolton Bears, while the Mustangs (2-4, 1-2) will head up north to take on the Winnfield Tigers.
