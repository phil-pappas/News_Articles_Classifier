Auclair Â© Provided by PGA\nThroughout the course of a season, there are countless jaw-dropping shots executed by the best players in the game.\nAdChoices Many of those are, in a word, \"perfect\" -- as in requiring just one shot from tee to green, a hole-in-one.\nThe 2014-15 PGA Tour season saw a total of 43 aces, including two each by Billy Hurley III, Andres Romero and Brian Harman (who had both of his in a single round!).\nRELATED: Players with the most aces in PGA Tour history | Share your ace\nHere's a look, with video, of my eight favorite aces from this past season.\n8. Dustin Johnson on the 227-yard, par-3 fourth hole at Trump Doral in the third round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship, a tournament he would go on to win.\n7. And, just three groups later, J.B. Holmes went and did the same thing on the same hole!\n6. Check out Patrick Reed with a hole-in-one on the 188-yard, par-3 16th in the third round of the Shell Houston Open at the Golf Club of Houston. I can't get enough of the fist pump.\n5. Justin Thomas, who was a Rookie of the Year finalist, snagged his first ace on the PGA Tour with this beauty at the Greenbrier on the par-3 18th hole -- a 175-yarder -- in the opening round of the Greenbrier Classic. How cool is the commentary from Thomas? \"Go in, please. Please go in.\" Doesn't happen often, but sometimes the ball listens.\n4. It's hard to call one ace better than another ace. They're all incredible. But, this one from Billy Hurley III in the second round of the Frys.com Open at Silverado's par-3 15th hole was pretty ridiculous. The ball nails the flagstick and could have been sent in any direction as a result. Instead, it dropped into the center of the hole.\n3. What better way to end a round of golf than with a hole-in-one? That's precisely what Rickie Fowler did in the opening round of the Quicken Loans National. Playing the back nine first, Fowler's round came to a close on the 200-yard, par-3 ninth at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club where he delivered a terrific walk-off ace. Now that'll make dinner taste extra delicious.\n2. Stupid. That's the best way to describe what Brian Harman did at the Barclays. In the final round of the first event of the FedExCup Playoffs, the former University of Georgia golf star nailed not one, but two holes in one. Here's a look at the second one. Harman's face says it all, \"Are you kidding me?\"\n1. Jordan Spieth wasn't going to let the season pass without getting in on the hole-in-one party. The PGA Tour and PGA of America Player of the Year Award winner picked up an ace in the opening round of the BMW Championship -- the third leg of the PGA Tour Playoffs for the FedExCup. Spieth aced the 196-yard, par-3 second hole.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.pga.com/pga-america/hole-one", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.pga.com/news/golf-buzz/players-most-holes-in-one-pga-tour"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:00:49.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
