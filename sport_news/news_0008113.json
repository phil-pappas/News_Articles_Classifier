Players from Clifton and Passaic Tech wore looks of disappointment, both sides frustrated with not coming away with a victory. \nThe game was a battle between two rival, evenly matched teams that split the previous two meetings. \nOn Tuesday, neither side would let the other leave with a win and played to a 1-1 tie in double overtime. \nMatt Miller scored in the first half for Clifton, and Felix Melo netted the Bulldogs’ equalizer in the second half. \n“It’s about as even as you could possibly get,” Passaic Tech coach Marc Foti said. \nWhen Clifton and Passaic Tech met in mid-September, the Bulldogs won, 3-1. Then they played again last week in the Passaic County quarterfinals, and the Mustangs pulled out a 2-1 victory. \nIn the semifinals, Clifton suffered a heartbreaking, 3-2 overtime defeat to Wayne Valley. So the Mustangs entered Tuesday looking to erase that sour memory with a victory. \n“Mentally, we had to recover quickly,” Clifton assistant coach Wojciech Sliwinski said. “It was a tough mental loss for us.” \nNeither side dominated possession. It was a frenetically paced game in which momentum shifted from side to side. Yet Clifton managed to strike first. \nGreg Kaleta sent a beautiful cross into the box from the left side, and Miller buried his shot with just less than seven minutes remaining in the first half. \n“In the first half, we came out playing OK soccer,” Sliwinski said. “But our intensity — we weren’t winning a lot of second balls. We weren’t really organized in the back, and we addressed that at halftime. In the second half we played a lot better.” \nStill, the Bulldogs tied it up 15 minutes into the half. \nMelo, a junior defender, took a shot from about 30 yards out and found the back of the net. Passaic Tech’s bench erupted. Foti said Melo typically doesn’t play that far up the field, but he had an opportunity and he took advantage. \n“He came out, made a great play,” Foti said. “Just calmly put it in the back of the net like he’s supposed to.” \nBut that was the final goal of the game. It was another tough fight for both teams, and there’s still a chance for another meeting in the state tournament. \n“We compete with them every single year,” Sliwinski said. “Just for the kids themselves, it’s a big fight every time we play them. I don’t think it changes that much, but it does give us that little extra bite to the game.” \nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:05:53.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
