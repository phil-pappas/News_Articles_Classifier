National Conference MLA Abdul Majid raised the issue as soon as the House assembled and sought a statement on the incident from the state government. Horticulture Minister A.R. Veeri said the police have arrested three persons involved in the attack and was looking for other culprits. He said the Director General of Police will visit Udhampur for an assessment of the situation. Two persons were injured when some miscreants hurled some combustible substance on a Kashmir-based truck last night at Udhampur, while the driver of the truck escaped unhurt, Veeri said. Not satisfied with the statement, all the Opposition MLAs walked out from the Assembly. Referring to yesterday’s peace resolution passed by the House, Majid said the ray of hope was only visible in Kashmir and not in Jammu. Senior NC MLA A M Sagar said the BJP was provoking the situation in Jammu region. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:18:06.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
