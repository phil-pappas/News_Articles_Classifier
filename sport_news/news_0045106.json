We will look to shut him down as much as we can, try to pressure him. \n“He brings players in often and is a real threat. \n“His goal-kicking has been pretty good too.” \nThere is belief amongst the Australians too that Foley is can continue his hot form. \nVeteran centre Matt Giteau said the 26-year-old was relishing the challenge being presented by Biggar and Wales. \nLast year, Giteau watched from the sidelines and provided expert commentary for TV as Foley orchestrated a win that extended the Wallabies’ streak to 10 over Wales. \n“They know what he’s capable of,” Giteau said. \n“It’s going to be a big test for him against Biggar who I think has been a really big player so far in the tournament. \n“He’s played some great football, not just in attack – defensively he’s quite solid as well. \n“That will be another big test for Nard (Foley).” \nGiteau, meanwhile, is also bracing for a tough outing against a monster Welsh midfield of Jamie Roberts and George North, the power-running winger who has been shifted infield to get him more involved. \nThe 110kg Roberts will line up at inside centre, opposite Giteau, in another anticipated energy-sapping clash for the 98-Test Wallaby. \n“With the centre combination they’ve picked, they use Roberts for their go-forward,” Giteau said. \n“They’ve brought North in to get a little bit more ball, he probably hasn’t seen as much as he would’ve liked in their first few games and he’s obliviously a dangerous runner. \n“They obviously see it as an effective weapon against Australia.” \nTeams: \nAustralia: Israel Folau, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, David Pocock, Sean McMahon, Scott Fardy, Dean Mumm, Kane Douglas, Sekope Kepu, Stephen Moore (capt), Scott Sio. \nReserves: Tatafu Polota-Nau, James Slipper, Greg Holmes, Rob Simmons, Ben McCalman, Nick Phipps, Matt Toomua, Kurtley Beale. \nWales: Gareth Anscombe; Alex Cuthbert, George North, Jamie Roberts, Liam Williams; Dan Biggar, Gareth Davies; Taulupe Faletau, Justin Tipuric, Sam Warburton (capt); Alun Wyn Jones, Luke Charteris; Samson Lee, Scott Baldwin, Paul James. \nReserves: Ken Owens, Aaron Jarvis, Tomas Francis, Jake Ball, Ross Moriarty, Lloyd Williams, Rhys Priestland, James Hook.
