Thackeray, who was addressing a party worker's meeting at Kalyan in the district, said the other name for BJP is \"bluff\" and it is a party of bluffers.\nTaking a dig at Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, the MNS chief said he is distributing package as if anyone is distributing 'Sakharpudapa' (sweets given during engagement). \"It is more than one year after BJP came to power, why is the package being given now and not earlier? Who can rely on this party which just makes announcements and does not do anything,\" he said.\n\"Don't they (BJP) feel ashamed to come and ask for votes without doing anything. They are doing what Congress was doing and even more than that,\" the MNS chief said. Thackeray mentioned that BJP declared 'Acche Din' (better days) within 100 days but it was no where to be seen. He also took a dig at Shiv Sena and alleged that the party along with BJP were together for corruption and were fighting separately in this polls.\nThe voting for the Kalyan Dombivili Municipal Corporation polls will be held on November 1. Thackeray said that he will address five public meetings for the polls starting October 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:27:35.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
