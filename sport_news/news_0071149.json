The OPP officer allegedly nudged the animal with his vehicle’s bumper. It would not move.\nScott said that because his dog cannot hear or see, it likely would not have responded when the officer nudged it with the bumper of his cruiser.\nSarah Leggett, another witness to the incident, told CTV News the officer later got out of his cruiser and shot the animal once.\nLeggett and O’Neil said they are concerned with how police deal with animals, especially in residential areas containing children.\nLeggett said a van arrived later and the animal was taken away. Scott said he has not yet been allowed to see the animal’s remains, which are in the care of animal control.\nAn officer was sent to the area to deal with the animal, which was “aggressive and possibly rabid,” Collingwood OPP said in Tuesday’s release.\n“Due to the danger this animal posed to both people and other animals and for the safety of the community, police had to put down this animal.”\nOPP Acting Sgt. Lynda Cranney said police are unable to confirm whether the animal was a dog, and will be incorporating witness statements, video, the officer’s firearm discharge report and other information into a detailed investigation into the incident.\n“The OPP is looking into the circumstances surrounding the video and remains committed to the humane destruction of wildlife when it is a threat to public safety.”\nIn a well-publicized pursuit in Newmarket on June 1, York Regional Police officers pursued, corralled and later shot a bear that was roaming through backyards in a residential area.\nPolice said they shot the bear during that incident because they could no longer keep the bear stuck in one place while they waited for Ministry of Natural Resources staff equipped with tranquilizers to arrive.\nPhotos A police cruiser is seen in an image from a video posted on Facebook, heading towards a coyote on a residential street in Collingwood on Oct. 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:44:46.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
