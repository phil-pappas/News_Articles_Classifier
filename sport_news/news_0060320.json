The center is located in Aleppo but is no longer able to make full use of its facilities due to the war in Syria.\n\"It just shows that the global system of fail-safe backup works,\" said Michael Koch, of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which funded the shipments.\nThe shipments were conducted secretly to avoid any security problems.\n\"We wanted to make sure that the publicity around this deposit is not taken by someone for different purposes,\" Koch told an Associated Press journalist visiting the Svalbard Seed Vault, just 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the North Pole.\nLocated on the outskirts of Longyearbyen, the main city in Svalbard, the gray concrete entrance to the vault blends into the wilderness. Perched on the side of a mountain, a door leads the rare visitor down a 120-meter-long (400-foot-long) tunnel into the mountain.\n\"Visitors see it as a James Bond kind of place, as extraordinary,\" Koch said.\nRecent visitors include several U.S. senators and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.\nNearly two-thirds of the specimens withdrawn last month are unique varieties of ancient crops from across the Middle East and Africa.\nThey will be used by ICARDA to fulfil requests for crop diversity from breeders, researchers and farmers around the world, so they can develop and test new strains to cope with a changing climate and new diseases.\n\"We can get, through crossing and breeding, traits that are tolerant to drought, tolerant to heat, tolerant to specific diseases and so forth,\" said ICARDA Director-General Mahmoud El-Solh.\nThe last of the seeds were sent to Svalbard in July 2012 at the height of the fighting in Aleppo when ICARDA's facilities were no longer able to duplicate or distribute its active collection.\nToday, the site struggles along with a small staff of dedicated people who must navigate complicated power shifts among opposing Syrian factions, while dealing with limited resources.\nSo far, it appears that the cold, the travel, and time haven't damaged the seeds, officials said. Those delivered to the Morocco gene bank will be sown in the coming season.\n\"It is wonderful to see the Vault is already proving its worth, and that we have been able to help our friends in the Middle East to continue their vital work,\" said Arni Bragason, director of NordGen, which co-manages the Svalbard vault.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:27:52.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
