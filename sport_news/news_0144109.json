Depending on the outcome of the MRI, Yacob could be prescribed either a regiment of rest and rehab or surgery. Even if he avoids surgery, Yacob could have to sit out a month. If he has surgery, Yacob may miss the entire 2015-16 season. Worthy: Dusan Perovic's return gives BU men optimism \nYacob earned America East Conference All-Rookie honors in 2013-14. He averaged 11.5 points per game, and finished the season as the team's second-leading scorer. He ranked second on the team in assists (70) and third in steals (26). \nLast season, Yacob suffered a shooting slump (34 percent overall) and saw his playing time cut into by freshmen guards Romello Walker and Justin McFadden. Yacob started 15 games and average 5.8 points per game as a sophomore. Marlon Beck, Dusan Perovic, Justin McFadden and coach Tommy Demspey share their thoughts heading into this season of Binghamton U. men's basketball.
