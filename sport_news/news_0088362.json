Every weekend it's very intense,\" Koeman said. \n\"You don't have a lot of difference between the clubs. You have to be play at a good level to win every game. \n\"You can lose against everybody. You can win against everybody. \n\"If you stay one year as manager you realise it's a tough competition. \n\"There's no Christmas break and you need a full squad for that.\" \nLiverpool are a team in transition under their new manager as they begin to adjust to Klopp's dynamic, high-pressing style of play. \nThe Reds were impressive in the opening half an hour at White Hart Lane but appeared to run out of steam, while old problems in attack resurfaced on Thursday as they failed to break down 10-man Kazan. \n\"On the one side it's difficult (to prepare for Liverpool) because maybe they have some players like Christian Benteke and Daniel Sturridge back from injuries,\" Koeman said. \n\"I think (high-pressing) it's how they like to play football. It was the same in the first game and (against Kazan). I don't think they will change. \n\"But the most important thing is ourselves. How we like to play, how we like to press, how we have to play compact as our team. It's all about that. \n\"You have to be focused on your job and the players have to play at the level they expect. \n\"Liverpool are a big team with a big history. They will always get more attention than Southampton. That's normal.\" \nKoeman may be without Jay Rodriguez for the clash. \nRodriguez has been eased back into first team action since returning from 16 months out with a cruciate ligament injury, but the forward is struggling with pain in his feet. \nShane Long is out with an ankle problem while Florin Gardos and Fraser Forster are also sidelined with knee injuries.
