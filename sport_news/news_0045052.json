Talk about making improvement as we go through the year. Give Texas the credit. They ran through some of our tackles and out-leveraged us at different points on defense. Offensively [the Longhorns] got pressure to us all day whether they were blitzing or not. We weren't able to run the football effectively. So, all in all, they kicked us and won the football game. There's not much else to say about it. The one turnover in the game, I believe, was the one fumble on the kickoff return. There weren't really a lot of fluky plays that could change the game. They won a good, hard-fought game.\"\nStoops on controlling the line of scrimmage:\n\"Just got beat. Like you said, offensively [there was] a lot of pressure, a lot of sacks and couldn't really run the football. And defense early on, I wouldn't say the line of scrimmage. It was more we lost leverage on a couple of the early touchdowns. And missed tackles. I think we had four missed tackles. That was a big issue. And again, they ran through the tackles, however you want to put it. Then, I thought, we got control defensively until the sprint draw. The sprint draw broke on us and went for a long run. And again we missed tackles. I think missed tackles were a big part of it defensively.\"\nMayfield on the amount of blitzes by the Texas defense:\n\"It wasn't like they were out-manning us. They were bringing five-man blitzes and pressure each time. It wasn't like they were completely zero blitzing us. They were dropping back into coverage too. They would just bring a different guy here and there. They decided that their mix-up blitz this week was their corner. Early on it got us. Then we made adjustments. At that point it was a little bit too late.\"\nDarlington on losing to Texas two years ago and today:\n\"I definitely don't think it was a lack of focus. We definitely did not underestimate them at all. We talked about it as a group on Monday and addressed it all week that they were much more talented and a capable team than their record. We didn't come in here with the mentality that we were going to push them around. We just didn't execute early. They brought some different stuff and we needed to do a better job of picking it up. They just physically beat us in the run game. We came into it with the mentality that we needed to run the ball and control the line of scrimmage. Obviously we didn't do that. That's where our problems came from; not being able to control the line of scrimmage. Getting into second and third and longs then allowing them to tee off on us on their pass rush and their blitzes.\"\nDarlington on how the offensive line can improve:\n\"It's consistency, a lot of it. A lot of the times we're having four guys do a good job and then have one guy make a mistake. It's a different guy every time. We'll see on film what happened. We just got to be more physical. Not more physical on Saturdays, we have to be more physical every day of the week and have a much better mentality. When we take the field we cant' wait. In the second half we got some drives together and started to do a little better.\"\nStriker on playing in a rivalry game like this:\n\"We expected them to give us our best. We know it's a rival game. They're going to come with their best each year not matter what the circumstance is. We knew what they're capable of. It's all about being a better team on Saturday and executing calls, doing everything that you're supposed to do. So it really wasn't a shock, no surprise at all. We knew they had the talent. Like coach said, they had a lot of close games. A couple plays and they're in a different position...We just weren't the better football team today.\"\nTwitter: @Josh_Friemel\n2015 AT&T Red River Showdown Texas 24, Oklahoma 17\nBox score\nCowlishaw: Texas' upset of Oklahoma alters narrative for Longhorns coach Charlie Strong\n5 memorable moments from Texas' big win in the Red River Showdown\nPhotos: Charlie Strong gets lifted up by team, wears Golden Hat; Longhorns celebrate with fans\nPregame photos: Fans pose by Big Texas as Texas and Oklahoma prepare for Red River Showdown\nTwitter reaction to Texas' upset of Oklahoma: Kevin Durant says 'Sorry NOklahoma'\nAttendance decreases, fails to crack 92,000 for first time since Cotton Bowl capacity increased\nTexas coverage Carlton: Embarrassment at TCU left Texas 'ticked off,' ready for redemption\nHow Texas' D-line took advantage of OU senior lineman's repeated mistake to make life tough for Sooners' QB Mayfield\nFive Thoughts: How Texas pulled off upset of Oklahoma\nCharlie Strong wears Golden Hat, Texas players throw coach in air after upset of Oklahoma\nPhoto: Texas Longhorn fans turn Oklahoma Sooners fan's car into trash can\nTwitter goes right for Longhorns, rapper Lil B lifts curse\nTexas quotable: 'Today was our day'\nUT's Malik Jefferson on Bevo's absence: 'It was weird because that's tradition and everybody loves that guy'\nHorns' Foreman tops 100-yard mark again\nUT's Malik Jefferson posts first two career sacks\nUT's Swoopes finding niche on short-yardage plays\nCharlie Strong's message for Gov.
