Run prevention was the story for the Cardinals, as has been the case for pretty much all of 2015. Now let's take a deeper dive and highlight some key takeaways from the series opener ... \n1. This was the first time the Cubs and Cardinals have met in the postseason \nIndeed, the Cardinals and Cubs, rivals since 1892, had never met in the playoffs until Game 1 on Friday. Granted, they've had the possibility of meeting in the postseason only since the advent of the wild card in 1995. Still, as much as we've been exposed to Red Sox-Yankees October drama, you'd think these two blood rivals would have run into each other at some point. Alas and alack! In their many regular season encounters, the Cubs hold a 1,197-1,147 edge. In the postseason, it's, well, Cardinals 1, Cubs 0.\n2. As you'd expect, the team that wins Game 1 of a best-of-five has a big edge \n\nNothing earth-shattering, but the team that wins Game 1 in series such as this, in which three wins are needed to advance, goes on to win the series 72 percent of the time. Stated another way, the Cardinals must, at a minimum, play .500 ball over the rest of the NLDS in order to advance the NLCS. The Cubs, in contrast, need to win three in a row or three out of four.\nOn that point ... \n#Cardinals are 8-0 in NLDS when winning Game 1. #Cubs are 0-11 when losing Game 1 of any postseason series.\nâ€” Paul Casella (@paul_casella) October 10, 2015 3. John Lackey turned in one of the best starts of his career \nHere's what Lackey did in the course of shutting down the Cubs on Friday night ... \nThat's a gem, as you can see. In terms of Game Score , a quick-and-dirty Bill James metric that measures a pitcher's dominance (or lack thereof) in a given start, Lackey earned a 78 on the night -- his second-highest figure of 2015 and tied for his highest ever in a postseason start (Game 4 of the 2002 ALCS is the only one that matches it). As well, just 19 times in 387 regular-season starts has Lackey registered a Game Score of 78 or higher. \n4. The Cubs' offense was uncharacteristically hurt by double plays \nDuring the regular season, the Cubs hit into the fewest double plays -- 101 -- of any National League team. (In all of baseball, only the Rangers, with 99, hit into fewer than the Cubs.) In Game 1, though, the Cubs hit into a pair of crucial twin killings: Kris Bryant 's 5-4-3 in the fourth and Anthony Rizzo 's 3-6 in the seventh. Those, of course, had a little something to do with Lackey, who induced 29 double plays during the regular season, which tied him with Mike Pelfrey for the most in either league.\n5. Yadier Molina (understandably) looks like he's still hurting \nIn Game 1, Molina was playing for the first time since he injured his thumb against the Cubs on Sept. 20. For a while, it appeared Molina might not be able to return until late in the postseason, if at all. However, he wound up being on the roster for the NLDS.\nHe didn't look right.\nIn his first at-bat, he feigned a bunt attempt and took a straight fastball right down the pipe. His next time up, he looked a bit more comfortable, as he flied out but was still tentative at the plate. In the fifth, he dropped a belt-high fastball to Anthony Rizzo, and it looked like Molina simply couldn't squeeze it. He went 0 for 3 on the night.\nA compromised Molina is still better than a healthy Tony Cruz , as the Cardinals have obviously determined. However, it bears watching how Molina looks over the course of what figures to be a hotly contested series.\n6. Home plate umpire Phil Cuzzi's strike zone was pretty tough on right-handed batters \nBoth sides were none too subtle at various points in their displeasure with plate ump Phil Cuzzi's zone. For the most part, he was tough on right-handed batters on pitches outside. Here, via Brooks Baseball , is a look at his Game 1 zone for righty hitters ... \n\n(Red shapes: called strikes; green shapes: called balls; from umpire's point of view) \nThe solid black box marks the rulebook zone, while the dotted line is the zone typically called against RHBs. As you can see, Cuzzi's called strikes sneaked beyond the far boundaries of both zones on occasion. \n7. Cardinal rookie hitters came through again \nCards rookies Stephen Piscotty and Tommy Pham combined to go 3 for 5 with a pair of homers on Friday night (fellow rook Randal Grichuk was hitless in two ABs). The first of those homers, Pham's, was an absolute shot ... \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nAll of this is fitting because the Cardinals this season rank sixth among all 30 teams with 5.9 WAR from rookie position players in 2015. No. 1 on that list? The Cubs with 11.3 WAR from rookie position players. \nGame 2 is scheduled for Saturday back in St. Louis. First pitch is scheduled for 5:37 p.m. ET. \n\nJohn Lackey was at his best in Game 1 of the NLDS.
