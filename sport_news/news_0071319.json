In the first quarter, Lamar Jackson had two consecutive wide-open completions to Quick down the middle of the field, for 48 and 18 yards, for the first score. It was Louisville’s first three-TD receiving game since DeVante Parker against Kentucky last year. \nDefensive Player of the Game: Rush end Trevon Young recorded his first two sacks of the season, including a fast, violent takedown of Florida State quarterback Everett Golson on a third down in the second quarter. Young also had a QB hurry. \nWhere the Game Turned: Louisville had a third-quarter meltdown. U of L lost a 7-6 lead early in the period on Dalvin Cook’s tackle-shedding 54-yard run, but the Cards responded quickly with Jackson’s 19-yard touchdown pass to Quick. After that, FSU struck back with another big scoring play. Golson connected over the middle to receiver Kermit Whitfield, who sprinted down the right sideline for 70 yards with 8:05 left in the third. That put FSU ahead 20-14. On U of L’s ensuing drive, Jackson was blasted and fumbled the ball away on a sack by Derwin James. That set up another FSU TD drive that included a targeting flag – an ejection – on Louisville linebacker Keith Brown. Jackson was picked off on the first play of Louisville’s next drive. It was suddenly 27-14 Florida State, and the Noles added a TD early in the fourth. \nKey Stat: FSU extended its winning streak against ACC competition to 28 games and its home winning streak to 18 games. Louisville hasn't won in Tallahassee since 1952. \nWhat Went Right: Jackson, who’d done most of his damage this season running the ball, was effective throwing the ball against Florida State, aside from the interception. He completed 20 of 35 passes for career highs of 307 yards and three TDs. He ran 19 times for 32 yards, including losing the fumble. \nWhat Went Wrong: Cook, an early candidate for the Heisman Trophy, gave FSU its first lead at the 13:09 mark of the third quarter on the 54-yard touchdown run in which he broke four Louisville tackles. Cook recorded 135 of his 163 rushing yards in the second half as Florida State bounced back from having zero rushing yards as a team at halftime. Golson added 372 passing yards.
