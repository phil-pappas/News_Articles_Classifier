Courtesy Kohli’s century, India piled up a commendable 299/8 in 50 overs and then restricted South Africa to 264/9 despite a classy hundred from their captain AB de Villiers. In the end, Kohli’s 23rd ODI hundred proved to be a shade better than De Villiers’ 22nd ton in the final context of the match. If Kohli’s innings was about asserting his supremacy in the limited-overs format, De Villiers was innovation personified, hitting all around the wicket. Credit should be given to India’s spin troika of Harbhajan Singh (2/50), Axar Patel (1/40) and Amit Mishra (1/55) for using the conditions well along with pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (3/68), who got the prize scalp of de Villiers. The series will now be decided at the Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium in the final ODI scheduled to be played on October 25. De Villiers battled cramps to race to a century but his superb 107-ball 112 could not get the Proteas home. The South African skipper hit 10 fours and two sixes before a slow bouncer from Bhuvneshwar saw him try a flat-batted shot, which ended up as a thickish edge into Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s hands. Earlier, Kohli blasted six fours and five sixes in his 140-ball 138, which is his first century in more than eight months. His last century was against Pakistan in a World Cup match at Adelaide in February this year. Kohli shared a 104-run partnership for the third wicket with Ajinkya Rahane (45) in 18.2 overs and then added 127 runs in 18.4 overs with Suresh Raina (53) for the fourth wicket to catapult India to a fighting total in their stipulated 50 overs. For South Africa, Dale Steyn (3/61) and Kagiso Rabada (3/54) took three wickets each, while Chris Morris (1/55) scalped one. India had slumped to 35 for two after both the openers — Rohit Sharma (21) and Shikhar Dhawan (7) — were sent back to the pavilion by Morris and Rabada, respectively. Kohli and Rahane joined hands at a time when India seemed in a bit of trouble at 35/2 in 10 overs. The duo slowly started accelerating and helped India cross the 100-mark in 19 overs. Kohli was more dominant between the two as he scored his fifty in just 51 balls with the help of two boundaries and two sixes. The India Test skipper notched up his century in the 38th over when he charged down the ground and blasted a six off Phangiso over long-on. He scored his century in 112 balls, with the help of four fours and three sixes. Raina too marked his return to form with a 52-ball 53, which was studded with three boundaries and one six, before becoming a victim of Steyn. Looking for a big shot, Raina ended up giving a simple catch to de Villiers at midwicket. — PTI India\nR Sharma c du Plessis b Morris 21 S Dhawan c de Kock b Rabada 7 V Kohli c de Kock b Rabada 138 A Rahane c de Kock b Steyn 45 S Raina c de Villiers b Steyn 53 M Dhoni c de Villiers b Steyn 15 H Singh b Rabada 0 A Patel not out 4 B Kumar run out (Steyn) 0 Extras (LB 3, W 12, NB 1) 16 Total (8 wkts; 50 ovs) 299 FOW: 1-28, 2-35, 3-139, 4-266, 5-291, 6-291, 7- 299, 8-299 Bowling\nD Steyn 10-0-61-3\nK Rabada 10-0-54-3\nC Morris 9 -0-55-1 A Phangiso 9-0-51-0\nI Tahir 9-0-58-0\nF Behardien 3-0-17-0 South Africa\nQ de Kock c Rahane b H Singh 43 H Amla c Dhawan b M Sharma 7 F du Plessis c Dhoni b A Patel 17 A de Villiers c Dhoni b B Kumar 112 D Miller lbw b H Singh 6 F Behardien lbw b A Mishra 22 C Morris run out (Rahane) 9 A Phangiso c Patel b B Kumar 20 D Steyn c Rahane b B Kumar 6 K Rabada not out 8 I Tahir not out 4 Extras: (lb 3, w 5, nb 2) 10 Total: (9 wkts; 50 ovs) 264 FOW: 1-36 2-67 3-79 4-88 5-144 6-185 7-233 8-250 9-250 Bowling\nB Kumar 10-0-68-3\nM Sharma 10-0-48-1\nH Singh 10-0-50-2\nA Patel 10-0-40-1\nA Mishra 10-1-55-1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:20:06.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
