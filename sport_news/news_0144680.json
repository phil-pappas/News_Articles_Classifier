Join the Conversation Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 11:53 p.m. CDT October 3, 2015 Auburn coach Gus Malzahn talks about 35-21 win over San Jose State Saturday. Matthew Stevens \nAUBURN – After the 35-21 victory Saturday, Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn came up with a new definition of what his “balanced” offense can be identified by. \n“We do what we have to do to win,” Malzahn said in a matter-of-fact manner after the game. “To be a really good offense, you have to be balanced. Balanced means that you take what they give you.” \nAuburn’s excellent field position allowed a conservative plan to flourish as their drive’s average starting point was the Spartans’ 47-yard-line. This led to the Tigers being satisfied to grind away 234 rushing yards on one of the nation’s worst rushing defenses in the country. Auburn is now 20-4 all-time under Malzahn when they score over 30 points in a game. \nAuburn running back Peyton Barber (25) runs downfield during the NCAA football game between Auburn and San Jose State on Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015, at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn, Ala.

Albert Cesare / Advertiser (Photo: .) \nWhen asked earlier in the week, the one thing Malzahn said he was fairly sure of was his offense could run the ball with Peyton Barber . The sophomore once again proved him correct with another career performance. After eclipsing the 100-yard mark in three of the first four weeks of the season, Barber made a dent in the scorebook with a career-high five touchdowns. Barber had four of his five scoring runs from inside five yards, marking the last time an Auburn running back had accomplished that many total scores since Tre Mason’s four touchdowns in the 2013 Southeastern Conference Championship Game against Missouri. The last time an Auburn player reached the end zone that many times was 2003 when Carnell Williams scored six times in a 45-13 victory over Mississippi State. \nBarber, a player who was buried as the third-string option leading up to the season opener against Louisville in the Georgia Dome a month ago, eclipsed the 100-yard mark for the fourth game this season. Barber finished with 147 yards on 28 carries. The sophomore from Georgia said he felt personally responsible for Auburn not being able to score a touchdown in last week’s loss to Mississippi State. \nAUBURN GRADES (35-21 win vs. San Jose State \nRushing offense – B – Barber scored all of Auburn’s five touchdowns, but the Tigers weren’t marching up-and-down the field until late. The Tigers picked up 234 yards on 48 carries. \nRushing defense – D – What rushing defense? If not for a forced fumble on fourth down inside Auburn territory, you had no idea the Tigers were out there at all. San Jose State’s Tyler Ervin rushed for 160 yards on 27 carries. \nPassing offense – D – There’s still no downfield passing attack. The longest pass play was a 42-yard screen from Sean White to Roc Thomas . It is going to be a challenge for White to stretch the field. Auburn threw just 10 passes. \nPassing defense – C – Justin Garrett intercepted a pass on ricochet, Johnathan Ford forced a fumble when the receiver was stood up and driven back and Carlton Davis picked one at the end of the game. But there was not a lot of pressure. \nSpecial teams – B – The Tigers opened the game with Blake Countess’s 61-yard kick return (but failed to take advantage of it and had to punt) and Ford returned one 54 yards. Daniel Carlson’s missed 25-yard field goal attempt didn’t help this grade. \nCoaching – D – Where is that fast and furious Will Muschamp defense? Auburn made just enough plays to keep hints of an upset at bay. But the Tigers didn’t control the line of scrimmage and the team’s offense scares no one. \nOverall – C – It was better than the game against Jacksonville State, but there’s nothing seen on Saturday to give any Auburn fan any glimmer of hope of this team recording an SEC victory any time soon. Can Tigers get better in bye week? \nKentucky (4-1, 2-1 in SEC) (Photo: File Photo) \nWhat’s next? BYE WEEK and then Kentucky \nAuburn head coach Gus Malzahn said it bluntly Saturday night when he said “the bye week couldn’t come at a better time” for his Tigers program. At 3-2, Auburn now has 11 days to prepare for a Thursday night road game at a Kentucky team that needed an overtime escape against a Football Championship Subdivision opponent Saturday night. Sound familiar Auburn fans? \nKentucky (4-1) trailed FCS member Eastern Kentucky 27-13 with 7:39 remaining, but JoJo Kemp's 7-yard TD run with 4:59 remaining followed by Patrick Towles' 5-yard touchdown pass to Dorian Baker with 52 seconds left in regulation tied the score. Towles led the charge, finishing with 329 yards passing and three touchdown passes, including the one in the final minute of regulation and one in overtime.
