Culturally, they look like a very tight-knight group,” Waugh said. \n“I’ve had a little bit to do with them on the inside but certainly watching them from the outside you can just see that they’re a very happy group, very confident in what they’re doing. \n“They keep talking about their identity so they certainly know their identity and that’s such a big piece in being successful in World Cups.” \nWaugh stopped short of declaring Australia’s dynamic back row the best in the world but said it had been integral to the Wallabies’ resurgence after they slipped to No.6 in the world earlier this year, their lowest-ever ranking. \n“The back row has been outstanding. But the back row is playing behind a tight five that’s been most dominant,” he said. \n“So the forwards are setting the platform and (five-eighth) Bernard Foley had the luxury of playing behind a dominant forward pack on Saturday afternoon. \n“That allows us to play our way and gives the backs so much freedom to play. \n“But, for me, the forwards have been very impressive. \n“In particular, the scrum and and then what Hooper, Pocock and Fardy bring to the breakdown, it’s a quite comprehensive forward pack.” \nWaugh, though, knows the tables can quickly turn and says it’s imperative the Wallabies topple Wales to avoid a treacherous knockout draw. \n“No team has ever won the World Cup after losing a pool match so there’s all these little things,” he said. \n“It’s not impossible if they lose this, but it’s a lot harder if you have to play South Africa in the quarter-finals and then probably the All Blacks in the semis.” Stay up to date with the latest sports news Follow our social accounts to get exclusive content and all the latest sporting news!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:58:00.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
