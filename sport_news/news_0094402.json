Slightly more than 3 percent of pregnant women surveyed admitted that they binge drink, which is defined as consuming four or more alcoholic drinks at a time, according to the report released last week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means that about one-third of women who drink during pregnancy binge drink. However, the study includes alcohol consumption before women realized they were pregnant, said Dr. Liza Ortiz, Tuolumne County’s public health officer. Half of American pregnancies are not planned, and some women don’t find out they are pregnant until they are several weeks along, so they could have been drinking, smoking and taking medications during the early stages, Ortiz said. “The other part of it is, plenty of people drink anyway or feel that it’s safe to drink a small amount when you’re pregnant, which is not the advice that all the medical organizations are standing by,” Ortiz said. “We don’t have any proof that such and such amount is totally safe.” American medical societies including the Centers for Disease Control are saying there is no known safe alcohol use during pregnancy, Ortiz said. There is also no known safe time during pregnancy for drinking, Ortiz said. “We know that alcohol use during pregnancy can cause birth defects and developmental disabilities in babies, as well as an increased risk of other pregnancy problems such as miscarriage, stillbirth and prematurity,” said Coleen Boyle, Ph.D., director of CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. “This is an important reminder that women should not drink any alcohol while pregnant. It’s just not worth the risk.” Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can happen in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. FASDs are completely preventable: If a woman does not drink alcohol during pregnancy, her child has zero risk of having FASD complications. The study used data from CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a state-based, landline and cell phone survey of the U.S. population. To estimate the prevalence of alcohol use and binge drinking, researchers used 2011-13 BRFSS data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia for women ages 18 to 44. In pregnant women, alcohol use was highest among: • Those age 35 to 44 (18.6 percent); college graduates (13 percent); and unmarried women (12.9 percent). For comparison, 1 in 2 (53.6 percent) non-pregnant women in the United States ages 18 to 44 reports drinking alcohol in the past 30 days, and 18.2 percent of non-pregnant women report binge drinking. Among women who reported binge drinking in the past 30 days, pregnant women reported a significantly higher frequency of binge drinking than non-pregnant women (4.6 and 3.1 episodes respectively). The prevalence of any alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant and non-pregnant women is slightly higher than estimates reported for 2006-10. However, this is likely due to methodological changes to the BRFSS in 2011, such as the addition of cell phone surveys, rather than actual shifts in the prevalence of alcohol use, the CDC said. Alcohol can cause changes to the way a baby’s skull and face develop, their head may be smaller than average, and they could be shorter and weigh less, Ortiz said. The neurological effects can be serious and include hyperactive behavior, memory and attention difficulties, speech delays, and hearing and vision problems, Ortiz said.
