Using such words such as “awful,”“pathetic” and “terrible,” he described a sloppy performance that left the Wildcats with a 1-2 record entering a challenging stretch of six straight games on the road. They gave up the first goal for the third game in a row, and fell behind 2-0 in both contests over weekend. They even trailed 1-0 and 2-1 in their opener against AIC before pulling away with a late surge. “I’m getting tired of that act,” Umile said. That act goes back to the exhibition against St. Francis Xavier when the Wildcats fell behind 4-1 before rallying. UNH never led in either game over the weekend while being swept by ECAC opponents St. Lawrence and Clarkson. The Wildcats lost to the No. 19 Saints, 3-2 in overtime, and surrendered the winning goal Saturday night in the final minute of regulation when Clarkson’s Jeff DiNallo whipped a wrist shot past goalie Danny Tirone with 42 seconds left. “I think it’s little details in the defensive zone like that last goal,” said senior forward Kyle Smith. “The guy’s all alone in the slot. We’ve got to put a stick on him and bring him down.” \"Absolutely pathetic,\" Umile said of the Wildcats' effort in general. \"It was a terrible display of hockey.\" Hoping to avoid the slow start that plagued them the last two years, the Wildcats failed to take full advantage of three consecutive homes games to open the season. “It’s frustrating right now,” Smith said, “especially losing the way we did. We’ve got to go on the road and we’ve got to start something. We can’t accept losing. We’ve got to establish a winning culture.” The Wildcats spent all weekend chasing the game. UNH trailed 2-0 in the first period Friday night and 2-0 early in the second on Saturday. The Wildcats managed to pull even in both games only to falter at the end. “Coach talked all week about playing every game like it’s a championship game,” said Smith, who had a goal and an assist Saturday night. “You just can’t come out flat like that. We need to play with a sense of urgency.” “We didn’t manage the puck very well with our forwards,” Umile said. “We turned the puck over. We didn’t cover well in our own end. It was awful. We didn’t get anything out of this to be honest with you other than how disappointed we are right now.” UNH rallied from deficits of 2-0 and 3-2 Saturday night. Freshman defenseman Matt Dawson tied the game for the second and final time with a shot from the left circle midway through the third period. But the Wildcats couldn’t sustain the momentum, much like Friday night when they netted the equalizer late in the third period, but ended up losing in OT. “I think we’ve got to look at the positives,” Dawson said. “Battling back shows our character. I think closing it out will come later in the year.” Learning from experience the last two years, the Wildcats can't afford to wait. “It’s frustrating,” Smith said. “We’ve been there before where we’re looking back at the year, and we’re out of the (NCAA) tournament by one or two games. It’s missed opportunities. We’ve got to get the ball rolling right away and change the momentum of our season right here.” That starts next weekend. The Wildcats open their Hockey East schedule Friday night at UMass. They play at Union on Saturday. The stretch also includes two games at Michigan State and two at league rival Merrimack. \"I feel like we can be tougher as a group,” Smith said. “There’s spurts and moments in the game where we were battling and dominating in the last two games, but it’s a 60-minute hockey game. We’ve got to bring it the full 60.” Saturday’s game against Clarkson turned physical with the teams combining for 17 minor penalties in the second and third periods, 10 on the Golden Knights. “That’s the type of game they brought to the table and we’ve got to push back and respond to that which I think we did well in the second period,” Smith said, “but it’s got to be the whole game.” “I don’t think there’s any panic right now,” Dawson said. “It’s super early in the season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:58:03.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
