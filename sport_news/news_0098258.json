To make matters worse, Jones was replaced as the starting tailback by freshman Justin Silmon and didn’t tally a single carry in K-State’s defeat against Oklahoma State two weeks ago. \nJones’ downturn in production led to Silmon’s success. Silmon began the season with a team-high 282 yards and a pair of touchdowns on the ground, earning a lot of time behind the quarterback as a reward for his success. \nThe success Silmon has had to begin the season allowed the young running back to start in place of the experienced Jones against TCU, forcing him to come off of the bench for the second-straight week. \n“Charles just has a fire lit under him,” K-State quarterback Joe Hubener said. “Obviously Justin (Silmon) bumped ahead of him on the depth chart, and I don’t think (Jones) liked that very much. Charles has come out and he’s shown that he obviously deserves to be getting some reps. He was running hard this last weekend, and probably had his best performance at K-State.” \nWhile he may have struggled to start the season, Jones isn’t a stranger to posting big games, having four in his career with multiple rushing touchdowns. Last season, Jones set a career-high against UTEP rushing for 76 yards and three touchdowns, both career-highs. \nWhile his 75-yard, two-touchdown performance against TCU was overshadowed by Hubener’s 111-yard, four-touchdown effort, Jones’ outing was his best game, statistically, since his record day against UTEP. \nThe highlight for Jones came in the second quarter when he made a strong move up field before being hit into the end zone to cap a 28-yard touchdown run, his first of the evening. \n“(The 28-yard touchdown) was significant,” K-State coach Bill Snyder said, “and what I told (Jones) when he came off was that it was the hardest that I’ve seen him run since he’s been here. That was a true statement, and I was pleased with his running.” \nEntering the contest as second-string, before having the hot start, Jones didn’t expect to have the breakout game he did. \n“I could agree that it was my best game. It’s been a while since I made plays like that,” Jones said. “It just felt good to make plays for my team and help my team try to win. I just tried to run hard, just go north and south. \n“You never know what to expect in a game, but it felt good to step up. The offensive line made my job easier by getting a great push. We have a great offensive line.” \nWhile his performance in the TCU game hints at his push to reassert himself at the top of the depth chart, he’ll have to compete with the consistent presence of Silmon in the backfield. \nFor now, it seems like both Jones and Silmon will be lining up in the backfield, sharing snaps until one of them stands out as the frontrunner for the position. \n“As you’ve seen, we’ve played both (Jones and Silmon),” Snyder said Tuesday. “If somebody does get a hot hand or somebody is being very effective in what they’re doing then obviously they are going to be on that field a little bit longer in the ballgame. We will continue to work with both of them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:41:39.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
