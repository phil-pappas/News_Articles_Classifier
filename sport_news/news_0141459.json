Not very. Swinney admitted during his Sunday afternoon teleconference that he doesn’t even know who was ranked sixth in last week’s poll. \nThat would be Notre Dame, the team the Tigers defeated 24-22 Saturday night in a soggy Death Valley. For Swinney, however, there is still a lot of football to be played and he isn’t concerned with polls or rankings. Not in early October. He also hopes his players aren’t worried about the rankings. \n\"I hope so. That's the thing about this stuff, especially with some of the media and television people. People just want to end the season after three or four games,” Swinney told the media. “It's like, 'Okay these teams are in.' I think it's funny. Every weekend is a season of its own. Just look around college football. I don't know who was No. 6 last week, but where are they now? You just have to go play the games. It's just irrelevant. It's great to know we are in the mix. We want to be in the conversation, but we've played just four games. We just have to keep our head down, keep chopping and find ways to win games. \n“The goal for us is to win our division, get to the championship game and have the best season we can have. All in all I loved our approach all week in getting ready. It's just one of 12. It was a special moment but it's one of 12. It's good for our guys to know they can win. We found a way to win. Another thing that's good is we're 4-0 and we haven't come close to playing our best football. We can improve tremendously. Give Notre Dame credit, though. They are a great team. We have a team that can fight. We made two big plays at the end to win it. I'm proud of our team. We have to keep developing and improving.” \nSwinney thanked the fans for being a big part of the win over the Irish. \n“I want to thank our fans for a great night. A great atmosphere to play a college football game,” he said. “Tremendous job by our fans. \"We won the turnover battle and we knew that was a key. We're back on the plus side of that for the year. We won the penalty margin. We're pleased with our special teams. We worked really hard over the last couple of weeks. It was good to see Andy Teasdall Andy Teasdall #32 5-11, 188Winston-Salem, NC View Full Profile flip the field. We had five punts fielded inside of the 20. Artavis Scott Artavis Scott #3 5-10, 191Oldsmar, FL View Full Profile had 120 yards on kickoff returns. The turnover we got on the kickoff coverage with Ammon Lakip Ammon Lakip #36 5-11, 200Alpharetta, GA View Full Profile , that was a great job right there. Just great hustle on the fumble by Mark Fields Mark Fields #24 5-10, 191Cornelius, NC View Full Profile . We were 1-of-2 on field goals and we recovered the onside kick at the end. Tremendous job on snaps too. \n\"Defensively a great start for us. Third down was solid. We knew our rush defense was going to have to be huge. Our defensive front played really well for the first three quarters. Nine tackles for loss. The biggest disappointment was the fourth quarter. It's 21-3 and we gave up over 200 yards in one quarter. I don't know the last time that has happened. We gave up too many big plays, 12 of 16 yards or more. We let them back in the game. That was probably the biggest disappointment after playing three great quarters. They were all correctable, though. We made the last play. That was all we needed to win the game.” \nClemson’s offense got off to a fast start, but stumbled in the second half and he admitted the coaches got conservative in their playcalling. \n“In that type of game there were a lot of people out there who felt we couldn't run the ball. We had 211 yards rushing.,” he said. “Our offensive line and tight ends did a great job. I thought we owned the line of scrimmage. To be able to run the ball when everyone knows you're going to run it, it's difficult to do especially in that type of game with those conditions. We were conservative with how we did things. The biggest positive was ball security. We had zero fumbles. Our backs did a great job. Deshaun Watson Deshaun Watson #4 6-2, 207Gainesville, GA View Full Profile did a great job. The biggest disappointment was four drops. We had three chances in the fourth quarter to put the game away and we drop a touchdown pass. We get an interception that we shouldn't have gotten. We can't let that ball get intercepted and then we missed a field goal. We should have been seven of 15 on third down.” \nOTHER NOTES \nInjuries and players of the game \n\"Injury-wise we came out of it in good shape. Austin Bryant Austin Bryant #91 6-4, 268Pavo, GA View Full Profile , I think he is going to be okay. We should get Dane Rogers Dane Rogers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:35:19.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
