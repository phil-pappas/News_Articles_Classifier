Comment By Jay N. MillerFor The Patriot Ledger Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 4:02 am Updated at 6:34 AM HALIFAX – On a weekend when nasty weather transformed the 56th annual Southeastern Amateur Championship, the golfer who enjoys battling the winds at Granite Links Golf Club was the only player to make par. Quincy’s Kip Webber shot an even-par 72 in Sunday’s final round at Country Club of Halifax, which, on top of his even-par 71 at Friday’s opening round at Easton CC, gave him his first championship with a total of 143. But to do that, Webber had to hold off a late surge from Don Reycroft of Lebaron Hills, who started the day a stroke behind Webber, and stayed on his heels throughout the final round. Reycroft finished at 144, in second place, but was also winner of the Senior Division crown. Pembroke’s Herbie Aikens, and Tim Johnson of Poquoy Brook tied for third at 147. The 2015 edition of the Southeastern was shortened to two rounds when Saturday’s scheduled second round at South Shore Country Club in Hingham had to be scrubbed due to inclement weather. Both men cited the 16th hole Sunday as the pivotal moment. With a 3-under score after the first nine holes, Webber seemed to be cruising to easy victory. But a bogey on the 12th, followed by a double-bogey six on the 13th hole, saw Webber’s advantage evaporating. When Reycroft chipped to within 30 feet on the 16th, and then drained the long putt, the tournament lead was hanging by a thread. “I had played three-under for the first nine holes, with four birdies and a bogey,” said Webber. “But on the back nine I was just not finding the fairway, with my tee shots going either right or left. I feel like I spent the whole back nine getting myself out of trouble. I had built myself a pretty comfortable margin, but then I made a couple mistakes and let Don back into contention. “I quickly went from four-under, to even par,” said Webber with a laugh. “But that’s golf – it’s a funny game. I had to press the ‘re-start’ button.” “Kip played unbelievable golf on the front nine,” said Reycroft. “He was really beginning to separate himself from the field. But then he lost a bit of his mojo, and we had about a five-shot swing. On my back nine, I was trying to focus on getting myself back to even par. On the 16th I hit my five-iron to within 30 feet, and then putted in for birdie. Kip had about a 15-footer, but it was actually tougher with the break he had. When he was able to follow up my big birdie putt with one of his own, that was huge. Kip played great today and deserved to win.” Webber, 24, is a 2014 West Point graduate, who mainly competed in gymnastics in college. A medical discharge ended his service career, and as his gymnastics competitive career also ended with his graduation, he’s turned more toward golf. Webber grew up playing the game at Stow Acres, but since moving to Quincy seven months ago, he’s fallen in love with Granite Links. “I work full time as a civil engineer,” Webber explained. “So I’m just a working stiff, who goes out and plays maybe a couple hours a night, and on weekends. I played my first Southeastern last year, and I finished fifth. The weather was difficult but I don’t mind the grind, and it was something everyone had to face, so it was fair. You’ve just got to roll with it. It’s all about staying mentally tough. “I think playing all the time at Granite Links, with all its wind, helped me this weekend,” said Webber. “I know I’m definitely a better wind player now than when I joined there. With a lot of gusts and crosswinds like today, there is certainly a big learning curve about how to deal with those conditions, and Granite Links is a great course for that. “My focus for the past year and a half has been more and more on golf,” he added. “This was my first big tournament win, anywhere, ever, and it feels tremendous.” Sunday’s best round was the 1-under 71 posted by Brockton’s Jason Cook, who is only gradually getting back into the tourney swing. Cook, a seven-time winner of the Brockton City Open, has been limiting his competitive golf to just that tournament in recent years. Cook ended in a tie for fourth place overall, at 148, with Thorny Lea veteran John Hadges. “Other than the Brockton City Open, this is my first amateur tournament in probably 25 years,” said Cook. “It’s been a long time, but I had a lot of fun and really enjoyed this one. I’m going to play as many tournaments as I can next year. A couple horrendous shots on Friday hurt me when I shot 77. Today I had three birdies, and no bogeys, but a double-bogey on the 14th – that was my only ‘oops’ today. But overall I had a lot of fun.” Steve Tasho Jr., with five-time Southeastern Amateur champion Steve Sr. as his caddie, shot a 75 Sunday to finish at 149, in a four-way tie for fifth place. Tasho Jr. was pleased be part of Thorny Lea quartet that took home the team title. “I hung in there today,” said Tasho Jr. “It was my first time seeing this course, and I didn’t hit the ball very well all day, but three-over is a score I can’t complain about. I hit one birdie, when I holed out from the sand trap on the 14th. But I also bogeyed the final two holes. I had a lot of good, scrambling shots, and it was good having my father on the bag. I really enjoyed my second Southeastern, for sure, and I’ll be back.” Cohasset’s Kevin Shea scored a 76, to finish at 150 total, good for a tie for sixth place. “I did okay, but I had four bogeys on the back nine today,” said Shea. “I had really played pretty well on the front nine, but three three-putts on the back nine really put a damper on my round.” SOUTHEASTERN AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:17:15.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
