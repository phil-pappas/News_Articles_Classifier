Certain that the gunman had fled, Paula ran out to the van and found Singh slumped against the door.\n\"I couldn't open it, but the police came really quick,\" she said.\n\"I just feel really bad; he was doing his job, and now he's gone,\" she added, refusing to provide a last name.\nPolice were told that Singh immigrated to the US 17 years ago, was unmarried and had a 13-year-old daughter.
