Fitzpatrick intercepted Texas A&M quarterback Kyle Allen and returned it 33 yards for a touchdown. The defensive touchdown gave Alabama a 7-0 lead and made up for a delay of game penalty on Alabama's previous series that prevented a field goal attempt.\nOn Alabama's next offensive drive, star running back Derrick Henry made a fool of Aggies safety Armani Watts on a 55-yard rushing touchdown. Henry had a big hole in front of him and showed why he's so difficult to stop once he can get to the second level.\nTexas A&M cut the lead to 14-3 after Taylor Bertolet 54-yard field goal.\nKey player: Henry couldn't be stopped in the first quarter. He rushed for a 55-yard touchdown and finished the quarter with 115 yards on seven carries.\nKey play: Fitzpatrick's 33-yard interception return for a touchdown gave Alabama the momentum and the early lead.\nSecond quarter\nThe second quarter was a lot like the first: Derrick Henry scored a touchdown and an Alabama defender returned an interception for a touchdown.\nEddie Jackson's 93-yard interception return gave Alabama a commanding 28-6 lead with 6:28 left in the first half. Texas A&M's offense was off-kilter and the Crimson Tide was rolling to what looked like a similar blowout to last year's 59-0 throttling.\nTexas A&M got into the back late in the quarter, though, on freshman Christian Kirk's 68-yard punt return for a touchdown. The touchdown woke up a sleepy Kyle Field and gave the Aggies a little momentum headed into halftime.\nKey play: Jackson's 93-yard interception return that featured beautiful footwork as he danced along the sideline for the long touchdown.\nKey player: Henry added his second touchdown of the game and had a career-high 178 yards at the half.\nThird quarter\nA bad special teams performance got worse for Alabama in the third quarter.\nCyrus Jones fumbled a punt return to set Texas A&M up on Alabama's 47-yard line. Kyle Allen connected with Ricky Seals-Jones on a 44-yard catch and then a three-yard touchdown to cut Alabama's lead to 28-20.\nAlabama felt the impact of center Ryan Kelly's absence in the third quarter after the offensive lineman suffered a concussion in the first half. Alabama's offensive line couldn't create the massive running lanes the way it was with Kelly, and had to start running Derrick Henry on the outside rather than through the middle.\nAfter Henry gained six yards on a big fourth-and-two attempt, Alabama was able to tack on three points with a 32-yard Adam Griffith field goal. Eddie Jackson nabbed his second interception of the game -- his fifth of the season -- to close out the quarter.\nKey play: Griffith hitting the field goal to give Alabama a two score lead.\nKey player: Eddie Jackson recording his second interception of the game.\nFourth quarter\nMinkah Fitzpatrick nabbed his second interception of the game and took it 55-yards to the endzone to give Alabama a 41-23 lead it wouldn't relinquish. It was his second interception returned for a touchdown in the game and third overall for the Crimson Tide. That broke a school record two interceptions returned for touchdown by Javier Arenas and Justin Woodall in 2008 against Arkansas.\nTexas A&M added a field goal in the fourth quarter, but wasn't able to get much going offensively.\nKey player: Fitzpatrick helping set a school record with his second interception return for a touchdown.\nKey play: Fitzpatrick's 55-yard interception returned for a touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:55:31.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
