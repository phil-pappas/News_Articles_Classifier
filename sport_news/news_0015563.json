It has been absolutely full for at least two months. I notified my commissioner Jeff Rader several weeks ago. His assistant forwarded my email to MARTA. Nothing has happened. I would greatly appreciate it if you could bring this to the attention of someone who can fix the problem,” wrote the reader.\nMARTA said this trashcan would be dumped immediately. Photo/Submitted.

Atlanta\nIn late September, we told you about Hiram Mitchell’s complaint on one of the city’s busiest roads.\n“My biggest hope is that the metal plate on Monroe Drive in front of the Wells Fargo Bank across from Ansley Mall be repaired. This is truly a golden oldie,” he wrote.\nWe agree with Mitchell that it has been around for awhile since we have gotten comments about this site for years.\nWe learned from city officials the job had been completed and plate removed.\nDays on list-6\nWho’s looking into it: City of Atlanta Department of Public Works Commissioner Richard Mendoza, 404-330-6240, rmendoza@atlantaga.gov\nNew item…and fixed! Atlanta\nDavid Bostwick has a problem with new bike lanes.\n“With the recent addition of bicycle lanes on Peachtree Center Avenue, concrete hemispheres have been placed on the road to separate the bike lanes from other traffic. One of them has wandered into a lane in front of the Marriott Marquis hotel, and it’s worse than a pothole. It’s right in line with the path of a car’s wheels, but drivers can’t see it until it’s right in front of them, and they dodge at the last second,” he wrote.\nBostwick said that he has seen several near collisions there, and also has had the experience of hitting it square.\n“Those who now know it’s there often drive partially into the other lane to avoid it. The area is already congested, with cars, bikes, and trucks all vying for space. I can’t believe it was put there on purpose,” he wrote.\nWe sent the item to the city and received a quick response.\n“The Department of Public Works sent out a crew to review the conditions of the bicycle lanes ceramic dividers in the area and to check all the other traffic control devices that are glued down to ensure that they are secure. The ceramic divider repair is complete. We encourage all residents to call 311 or visit the ATL311 website to file their complaints. This customer service tool is accountable and provides the public with quick, easy access to government information,’ said city spokeswoman Jewanna Gaither.\nDays on list-2\nWho got it fixedt: City of Atlanta Department of Public Works Commissioner Richard Mendoza, 404-330-6240, rmendoza@atlantaga.gov\nWHAT’S BROKEN NEAR YOU?We want tips from across metro Atlanta.
