(Photo: Cary Edmondson, USA TODAY Sports)\n147 CONNECT 59 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Colin Kaepernick's stock has never been lower.\nIt's gotten so bad, there are actually San Francisco 49ers fans calling for Blaine Gabbert — the owner of a 66.8 career passer rating — to start behind center.\nThis comes just two years after respected football analyst Ron Jaworski said the 49ers young quarterback could one day become the best to ever play the position .\nKaepernick's apparent regression has led some to ask what happened to the 27-year-old . But that's the thing. Kaepernick hasn't gotten any worse. He's still the same quarterback who led the 49ers to the doorstep of the franchise's sixth Lombardi Trophy — and that's the problem.\nKaepernick has not regressed. He has stagnated, while the rest of the team has gotten worse around him.\nLet's go back to when his stock was at its highest, after the Niners' Week 1 win over the Green Bay Packers in 2013. Kaepernick threw for a career-high 412 yards and three touchdowns.\nOn the tape of that game, he's the same quarterback making the same mistakes, only with a much larger margin of error.\nHe had questionable accuracy:\nHe was too quick to leave a clean pocket, causing him to miss open targets:\nAnd he took too long to come off his initial target. But back then, Kaepernick had time to slowly work through his progressions.\nWhen Kaepernick was at his best, the offensive line was at its best as well. Only LT Joe Staley and LG Alex Boone remain from what was once the best offensive line in the NFL.\nOnce Kaepernick's salary jumped, the team has asked him to do more. What was once a passing game designed specifically for quickly creating clear throwing options has slowly evolved into a more traditional scheme.\n“I know everybody wants to get down on him but give the kid a chance to grow into the position,\" said former NFL QB Kurt Warner , who worked with Kaepernick in the offseason. \"I have no idea what his future is going to be, but it’s a young man that’s never really had to play the position like they’re asking him to play it now and he’s trying to learn and he’s learning under the gun.”\nIn other words, the 49ers are trying to fit a $100 million square peg into a round hole that is not as talented as it used to be.\nIt might be too late in the game for Kaepernick to relearn how to play the quarterback position — he turns 28 in November — but he still has the physical tools to operate in a successful offense around him. But it will take a lot of cap space — to pay a dominant offensive line and running game — and a coach willing to play to a mobile quarterback's strength to put Kaepernick in a position to succeed again.\nRight now, San Francisco has neither of those.\nThe 49ers have Kaepernick under contract until 2020, paying him, on average, $19 million a year. That may be too much money for a guy who has proven incapable of elevating the players around him, but it's unlikely Kaepernick would be willing to rework his deal. And, given the structure of the contract, San Francisco can easily move on from the 2011 second-round pick. At this pace, Kaepernick might not be on the roster in 2017.\nIf you want the \"old\" Kaepernick back, give him the right supporting cast. You're not going to find it in San Francisco, though.\nNow, on to the rankings...\nLAST WEEK vs. SF: 22-32, 224 yards, 1 touchdown\nThe 49ers defense kept Rodgers and company at bay for the most part, but the 2014 MVP still provided us with a reminder that he's the best in the game .\nLAST WEEK: Bye\nBrady and the Patriots were on bye last weekend, but he's slowly closing in on the top spot in these rankings after a ho-hum performance for Rodgers. If I had to pick an MVP favorite at this point in the season, New England's quarterback would be the guy.\nLAST WEEK vs. CLE: 23-38, 358 yards, 3 touchdowns\nRivers was at his best on Sunday against Cleveland despite playing behind a depleted offensive line. If it seems he's always a step ahead of opposing defenses, it's because he is. Just ask the Browns defense .\nLAST WEEK vs. HOU: 19-27, 256 yards, 1 touchdown\nThe Falcons didn't ask much of Ryan in a blowout win over Houston. When the Texans weren't presenting him with big play opportunities, he was using his underrated athleticism to create them on his own .\nLAST WEEK vs. DAL: 33-41, 359 yards, 2 touchdowns\nWelcome back, Drew Brees. After sitting out a week to rehab a sore shoulder, Brees dissected the Cowboys secondary and, more importantly, showed more zip on downfield throws. He was named NFC offensive player of the week for his effort.\nLAST WEEK vs. STL: 29-46, 352 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception\nThe Rams put some pressure on Palmer, and there were times he was hurried into poor decisions. But for the most part, he handled everything St. Louis threw at him. Bruce Arians might have the best offensive scheme in the NFL, and Palmer is doing a fine job running it.\nLAST WEEK vs. BUF: 20-35, 212 yards, 3 touchdowns, 1 interception\nHow do you beat the Bills and their ferocious pass rush? Get the ball out quick. That's exactly what Manning did in the Giants' 24-10 win in Buffalo. Eli was sharp and decisive. We'd like to see that more consistently.\nLAST WEEK vs. DET: 20-26, 287, 1 touchdown\nIt's impossible to evaluate Wilson with him running for his life nearly every pass attempt. He's still making the amazing escapes we have come to expect, but there's no telling if he's taken a step forward as a pocket passer without, you know, a pocket to pass from.\nLAST WEEK vs. TB: 11-22, 124 yards, 2 touchdowns\nNewton was also a difficult evaluation this week with the Panthers and Buccaneers playing in a torrential downpour in Tampa. He wasn't as sharp as he'd been the week before, but it's understandable given the weather conditions.\nLAST WEEK: Did not play\nLuck should be back this week after dealing with shoulder issues last week. We're still giving him the benefit of the doubt after struggling early in the season, but another uneven performance will push him out of next week's top 10.\n11. Peyton Manning, Denver Broncos\n12. Andy Dalton, Cincinnati Bengals\n13. Derek Carr, Oakland Raiders\nManning's arm is going to be a liability all season. Finding open receivers is never going to be his problem; getting the ball to his intended target is another matter. Until the 38-year-old learns to deal better with his new normal, the Broncos offense will struggle. ... Dalton has benefited from playing with the league's best supporting cast, but there's no denying he has dramatically improved his deep ball accuracy. With that said, I'll be more willing to buy into Dalton's improvement if he impresses against a dominant Seattle defense. ... Carr keeps churning out solid performances, and that type of consistency will go along way in keeping the Raiders competitive. Give credit to new offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave for taking advantage of Carr's prodigious arm talent this season.\nWe haven't seen a lot of Jay Cutler this season, but his two appearances in 2015 have to be encouraging for the Bears, who are locked into at least another season of him behind center. His arm is still as strong as it always has been and the Bears' new offense under Adam Gase has put him in a better position to succeed with shorter throws and more clearly defined reads. But the biggest improvement this season has been his movement inside the pocket. Chicago's offensive line had a difficult time maintaining a pocket against the Raiders. Cutler did a good job of drifting, sliding and climbing into the little bits of real estate the line provided while keeping his eyes downfield. It's not a huge development, but these are the nuances of the quarterback position that Cutler has always lacked.\nLost in the Jets' 3-1 start is just how poorly Ryan Fitzpatrick has been playing. Todd Bowles has made it clear Fitzpatrick is his starting quarterback, and it likely will cost New York in the very near future. Geno Smith is healthy again after a teammate broke his jaw, and it's fair to question why the Jets aren't giving him a shot at starting after he was named the starter in training camp. Smith's biggest weaknesses as a passer are his inconsistent accuracy and penchant for throwing into tight coverage. Fitzpatrick just happens to have the same weakness, which were on full display in London. When he wasn't throwing dangerous passes, he was missing wide open receivers. Smith isn't a great option, but he's younger and has a much better arm.\nMarcus Mariota had the week off, and Jameis Winston is probably wishing he did, too. We would give the rookie the \"torrential downpour\" excuse we gave Cam Newton, but five turnovers on mistakes we've seen him make before is hard to explain away with bad weather. Winston needs to start learning from these mistakes and showing that maturation on the field.\nBest throw of the week Andy Dalton might not have established himself as a franchise quarterback just yet, but there's no denying how good this throw on the run with a pass rusher close on his tail was.\nWorst throw of the week Kaepernick gets this honor for a second consecutive week. It's not just that he threw it into double coverage, but he also missed a wide open Torrey Smith underneath. It's a bad throw and even worse decision.\n147 CONNECT 59 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT //usat.ly/1RuGTHJ", "external_links": ["http://imgur.com/2LxXI6N.png", "http://imgur.com/Y2B3oPL.gif", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798375311325383-USATSI-8843716.jpg", "http://imgur.com/uNGovNe.png", "http://usat.ly/1RuGTHJ", "http://imgur.com/wQoYWqJ.png", "http://imgur.com/Ob7jAq3.png", "http://imgur.com/2e8zkd1.gif", "http://imgur.com/OuAppA0.png", "http://imgur.com/06fiKZz.png", "http://imgur.com/TQYcqZz.png", "http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/oct/06/chargers-browns-nfl-philip-rivers/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RuGTHJ&text=QB%20Rank%2C%20Week%204%3A%20What%27s%20wrong%20with%20Colin%20Kaepernick%3F&via=enquirer", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8f3f368eebfa74024c03cd7a33b03f7b08cb8d3/c=73-147-3441-2679&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798375311325383-USATSI-8843716.jpg", "http://imgur.com/1WU7K2y.gif", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798375311325383-USATSI-8843716.jpg", "http://imgur.com/AVsMe8l.png", "http://imgur.com/OhlS9pt.png", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RuGTHJ&mini=true", "http://imgur.com/9Eav13t.gif", "http://imgur.com/Rr3DDkd.gif", "http://imgur.com/wpaSvbI.png", "http://imgur.com/9UTaSEL.gif", "http://imgur.com/m4oU9Vf.png", "http://imgur.com/wfk863e.png", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/what-happened-to-colin-kaepernick-san-francisco-49ers-stats", "http://imgur.com/epS5MeN.png", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/08/colin-kaepernick-ron-jaworski", "http://imgur.com/u1heXaM.png", "http://i.imgur.com/Gf7h0bD.gif", "https://streamable.com/6a6a", "http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2015/10/05/kurt-warner-on-49ers-kaepernick-give-the-kid-a-chance-to-grow-into-the-position/?source=rss"], "published": "2015-10-08T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:17:35.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
