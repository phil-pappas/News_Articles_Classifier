That probably partly explains why he spent Friday raving over the chemistry in the Jets’ locker room, a team-first, all-in attitude he said he never has experienced before.\n“I’ve been one, in the past, early on in my career — especially in Denver, contract situation — handled it the wrong way,’’ Marshall said. “We have guys in this locker room that really get it. That’s the coolest thing about what we’re doing. It’s a special group, man. I love seeing guys make a mistake and throw their helmet on the ground or get pissed off, show that they care. That’s across the board: Young guys, older guys, scout-team players. It’s a special locker room.’’\nMarshall said when he got traded to Miami from Denver — where he was suspended for the 2009 finale — he “didn’t get it.\n“I didn’t understand,” he said. “My heart was in the right place. The second year in Miami is when I had that transformation and really understood it. … But anything before then I was super-immature. Heart was in the right place but I didn’t deal with things the right way.’’\nBut Marshall said he sees things being done the right way from top to bottom, from a Pro Bowler such as Darrelle Revis taking every snap seriously and spending his time with practice squad players, to seeing linebacker Demario Davis wearing an oxygen mask Friday and riding a stationary bike to get extra conditioning.\n“The first thought that came to my mind was ‘This is why this team is special,’ ” Marshall said. “There’s a lot of guys doing that stuff. It’s just a great spirit in this locker room. It’s something I’ve never been a part of, where you have so many guys moving in the same direction. That’s hard to do in this day and age. I’ve been a part of some teams where we were very fragmented.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:22:17.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
