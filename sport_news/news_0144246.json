We just have to clean the mistakes up. The little things are killing us.”\nOf the next four games, the Golden Bears are the only ranked foe that awaits, perhaps giving the Bruins (4-2, 1-2 Pac-12) an opportunity to reverse course and follow a similar script.\n“If you believe in what you're doing, you do it and you keep trying to do it better, make improvements, get rid of the things that aren't working and improve on the things that are working, you try to put your players in the best position you can,” Mora said. “But you don't panic. So we’ve learned that and we’re going to be better for it.”\nREVISITING TARGETING\nUCLA has had one of its players ejected for targeting in two of the past four games.\nAgainst BYU, sophomore linebacker Kenny Young was whistled for targeting Tanner Magnum when the Cougars’ quarterback slid on his team’s opening drive.\nThe latest targeting penalty came against Stanford when receiver Kenny Walker was called for targeting linebacker Blake Martinez. As quarterback Josh Rosen was running downfield, Walker threw a block on Martinez, hitting him in the neck.\nThe targeting rule was implemented in 2008, and its more controversial element – an automatic ejection – was added in 2013.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-ucla.bruins.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-ucla.bruins.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:49:34.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
