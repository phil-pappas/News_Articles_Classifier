(AP Photo/Craig Mitchelldyer) more > By ANNE M. PETERSON   \nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Lauren Holiday celebrated the final game of her career with another title. \nThe midfielder, who won the Women’s World Cup with the U.S. national team this summer, won a second straight National Women’s Soccer League championship with FC Kansas City on Thursday night. \nHer good friend and teammate Amy Rodriguez scored on a header in the 78th minute, giving the Blues a 1-0 victory over the Seattle Reign. \n“It doesn’t get any better than this,” Holiday told the cheering crowd at Providence Park afterward. \nHoliday announced plans to step away from the game in July, shortly after the United States won the World Cup, but she vowed to first finish out the season with her NWSL club. \nHer final victory came in dramatic fashion: Rodriguez scored off a cross from Heather O’Reilly in the 78th minute. \nMoments later, Holiday collapsed on the turf and a stretcher was brought on to the field. But Holiday, who has arrhythmia and later said she just needed to calm down, walked to the sideline on her own and eventually returned for the final minutes of her last competitive game. \nWhen time ran out, she was mobbed by her teammates. \n“When that clock was ticking down, I was thinking, ‘Just hold on. We can hold on a couple more minutes,’” Holiday said afterward. “And to win for club and country is absolutely the best feeling in the world.” \nThe Blues also played the Reign in the championship match last season, with Kansas City coming out on top 2-1. \nSeattle was undefeated in nine straight matches going into the championship, without loss since July 18 at the Washington Spirit. \n“We’re massively disappointed,” Reign coach Laura Harvey said. “But we’ll learn from it.” \nThe Blues finished the regular season 9-6-5, with a roster that includes U.S. national team players Holiday, Rodriguez, O’Reilly and Becky Sauerbrunn. Those players missed a number of games because of the World Cup in Canada. \nKansas City had a league-high 10 shutouts this season, including the final, and allowed opponents an average of just one goal per game. The Blues defeated the Chicago Red Stars in the semifinals to advance. \nThis was the Blues’ third straight appearance in the postseason: The Portland Thorns won the league’s inaugural championship in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:32:43.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
