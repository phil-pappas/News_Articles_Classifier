Manning said there's a \"better understanding, better feel for the offense than last year.\" The Eagles faced Manning twice last season in the system: One was what Davis called the Eagles' best defensive game, the other was what he considered their worst. \nIn the first game, a 27-0 Eagles win, Manning threw for a season-low 151 yards and was sacked six times. When the teams met at the end of the season in a 34-26 Eagles victory, Manning threw for a season-high 429 yards and was sacked only once. The Eagles allowed six passes of more than 20 yards in that game, although Manning attempted 53 passes that afternoon. \nThe Giants also had star receiver Odell Beckham Jr. healthy and standing out by that point. Beckham's status for Monday is undetermined while he deals with a hamstring injury. The Giants are also monitoring the status of Rueben Randle, who has a hamstring injury. \n\"If he throws it is that many times, he's going to put eight to 10 of them vertically on you. You have to make the plays that he goes vertical with,\" Davis said. \"Beckham is a hard tackle, so when he does throw it underneath to Beckham, you have to get him tackled because he's a great run-after-catch receiver. Those dynamics and the weapons they have - Randle has had some great games, catches the vertical ball very well.\" \nThe Eagles' defense had been committed to cutting down those \"X plays,\" but they became a problem again Sunday in a win over New Orleans, when the defense allowed seven pass plays of 20 or more yards - six of which came on third downs. Safety Malcolm Jenkins said the Eagles' goal is to limit offenses to three or fewer per game. \n\"Those are things we're going to correct,\" Jenkins said. \"It was our Achilles' heel last year.\" \nThe threat of big plays increases if Beckham and Randle are healthy. Davis said the Eagles defense is preparing for the Giants to have their wide receivers in the lineup. Coach Tom Coughlin said Beckham would not have practiced if the Giants had a workout on Wednesday. \nAnother Eagles goal is to force three turnovers per game. They forced four against the Saints, three of which were fumble recoveries. In past years, the Eagles might have counted on interceptions against Manning. He has averaged one interception per game in 22 career games against the Eagles. Coughlin said there has been an emphasis on reducing interceptions and it has been evident this season. \n\"Just try to make smart decisions,\" Manning said. \"Having a good feel for the offense, knowing where the ball's going. Get to your second and third reads if you have to. We've had leads - you're not behind trying to force things and make plays because you feel you have to be able to get something going.\" \nBut there have been opportunities for interceptions because Manning is always in the lineup. He has not missed a start since becoming the starter in 2004. The Eagles have started seven quarterbacks against Manning in that span. Sam Bradford will be the eighth. \nThe Eagles understand why Manning avoids unnecessary hits and remains on the field. \n\"He knows his team's success lies on his shoulders, so he can't take hits for no reason,\" Jenkins said. \"As a defense, you want to disrupt the quarterback. He won't allow you to get hits on him, so that's smart. We have to obviously be patient. And when we do have a shot, we need to make it count.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:55:22.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
