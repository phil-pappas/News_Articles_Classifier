They want explanations. They want strategies. They want the pumpkin-snacking to end, Sullivan said.\nSullivan's standard response is that the gray and fox squirrels known to this area feast on the pumpkins because they are there. In the fall, squirrels are trying to get as fat as possible to prepare for a long winter when they'll need heftier bodies for warmth and stored energy as food becomes scarce. Corn — you may have noticed those decorations getting snacked on, too — is usually a squirrel's first choice because it seems easy to bury and offers dense carbohydrates that are good for energy.\nBut if pumpkins are nearby, or, as during Halloween season, beckon from nearly every yard, the bushy-tailed rodents certainly aren't going to refuse.\nDetermined snacker PV Balcombe / Rex Features A squirrel stuffs its head into a small pumpkin packed with peanut butter meant to serve as a bird feeder Oct. 29, 2012, in Hampshire, England.\nA squirrel stuffs its head into a small pumpkin packed with peanut butter meant to serve as a bird feeder Oct. 29, 2012, in Hampshire, England.\n(PV Balcombe / Rex Features) Sullivan has heard some homeowners claim success after rubbing strong peppers over a pumpkin's surface. Chemicals such as bleach or other poisons could keep the critters at bay but raise existential questions about urbanites separated from the natural world. \"We love to see squirrels hopping around in our neighborhoods, but we're dismayed by their activities,\" Sullivan said.\nHe runs a national research project that enlists citizen scientists to observe squirrels and assist in the studies. But Sullivan prefers a more squirrel-friendly approach. He and his kids like to put nuts inside their carved pumpkins so the squirrels feast on those instead. Strategically placed peanut butter on a pumpkin can also make for fun \"squirrel carvings,\" he said.\n\"Rather than expecting to have a part of our house that looks like something on Martha Stewart Living, why don't we just recognize this is a part of life and these little squirrels are just as cool of a part of our decorations as something else?\"\nNot quite convinced?\nKeep in mind that 80 percent of squirrels don't make it to their first birthday, Sullivan said. So Halloween season could be the meal of a lifetime.\nvortiz@tribpub.com\nTwitter @vikkiortiz\n Halloween", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56200c16/turbine/ct-squirrels-eating-pumpkins-met-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56200bf1/turbine/ct-pumpkin-squirrel-aj-jpg-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:33:05.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
