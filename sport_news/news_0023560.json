We're going where no major pizza brand has gone before.\"\nAnd there's a reason for that. Pizza in Italy is a local delicacy that already has a lot of Italian competition.\nThe Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera even said, \"Let's face it: it's like selling ice cubes to Eskimos.\"\nDomino's plans to woo Italian customers by only using local products in the pizzas, including locally sourced wheat for the dough.\nThe company says the sauce will be 100 percent tomato sauce and other toppings will go more with the Italian palette, such as prosciutto, gorgonzola cheese and mozzarella di bufala cheese.\nAnother concern is the Domino's delivery model. Although the company's CEO says it may be an advantage, Italian culture calls for longer meals, and Italians don't eat nearly as much fast food as Americans do.\nDespite Domino's plans to work with the Italian culture, it won't be easy. So, is the pizza giant doomed to fail? Guess we'll wait and see.\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.\nTrending on Facebook\nShark attacks man, ends up saving his life Couple reveals too much in their engagement announcement Too much?
