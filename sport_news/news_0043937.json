The second Monday in October is historically celebrated as Columbus Day, a federal holiday. But as of next Monday, Portland will celebrate the people who called the state home for centuries.\n\"I'm just really overwhelmed by this first step,\" said Se-Ah-Dom Edmo, a Native American and Portland Human Rights commissioner whose family is from Celilo Village in the Columbia River Gorge.\nAdvocates of Native Americans have pushed the movement for nearly four decades.\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt first recognized Columbus Day in 1937, and Richard Nixon made it a holiday in 1972. In 2010, the United Nations acknowledged the suffering and lost land and resources of Native people, according to a city statement.\nMayor Charlie Hales said Wednesday that Portlanders have a responsibility to \"remember and to learn\" about the region's history. \"We can remember, we can repair, and we can respect,\" Hales said.\nPeople lead a procession of tribal members before the kickoff for the newly opened Tilikum Crossing, a unique bridge, in Portland, Ore., Saturday, Sept. 12, 2015. The bridge is one that highlights green traits the city is known for: it's bike friendliness, light-rail and appeal to folks who like to walk. Buses will be allowed but not private cars.

Seattle and Minneapolis adopted similar resolutions in 2014.\nIn an email, Hales' spokeswoman Sara Hottman said city employees don't have the holiday off.\nPortland has the ninth largest urban Native American population.\nReyn Leno, chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Grande Ronde , said the community is elated.\nHe told the City Council that indigenous people took great honor in the naming of the Tilikum Bridge, and enjoyed last month's opening ceremony.\nBut Leno said more could be done. \"You can't erase history and culture with a piece of paper and pencil,\" he said. \"But you can do things like this.\"\n-- Andrew Theen\natheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": ["http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9118251.js", "http://www.grandronde.org/tribal-council/members/reyn-leno/"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:24:29.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
