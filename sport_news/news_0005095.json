Steve Lewis/Durango Herald file photo Nicholas Turco (right) and Benjamin Lachelt (left) have been running side by side for a long time and have led the Demons to a No. 2 ranking in Class 4A so far this season. W hen it comes to high school sports, sometimes what happens off the field, away from the playing surface is more meaningful and memorable than the action on gameday. That’s the case this week, as Durango High School’s cross country teams embark on the annual trip to Arizona for the Desert Twilight XC Festival scheduled to take place Friday afternoon and carrying into the darkness of night. “This is more than just a race for these kids,” said Durango head coach David McMillan. “The race itself is special, but we drive almost eight hours, we camp as a huge group, and we do team building things that are really powerful for these kids. It’s the whole experience they’ll remember, not just the race.” The bus ride and the orchestrated team building is part of the experience. The trip includes an affirmation circle that bonds an already close group during a group run that goes through a sinkhole near the team’s campsite. “We all circle up in the sinkhole and share a compliment with the person to our right,” said Sarah Smagacz, daughter of Anthony and Betsy Smagacz. “It’s the last meet of the season for some people, so it’s just something neat where everyone gets to be involved and feel good about themselves and their teammates.” The team activities abound. “We have so much fun that it’s hard to point out one thing in particular,” said Maggie Wigton, daughter of Bruce and Julie Wigton. “We all dress up in different costumes and go out to dinner. We camp together and go to Sedona after the race. It’s a cool experience.” All the extracurricular activities are fun and important, but the race itself is one of the premiere events in the Southwest. Durango’s boys are the No. 2 ranked Class 4A team in Colorado and No. 9 in the Southwest Regional rankings produced by Milesplit.com. The Demons will get a chance to compete against the Nos. 3, 5 and 6 teams in the regional rankings, as well as the 13th -nationally-ranked Desert Hills High School. Though the Demons’ seniors are looking forward to the final ride down to Phoenix, it is a business trip for them, too. “There are so many good teams out there, and everyone understands that they’re racing against some of the best runners around,” said DHS senior Nicholas Turco, son of Richard Turco and Jack and Jennifer Turner. “There’s an energy that can just sweep you up, and you can feel that the teams are all feeding off that energy. It’s powerful.” It might be easy to get overwhelmed and awed by some of the talent, but the senior group running this year took fourth place in the event last year and has high hopes again this time around. “I might have been a bit intimidated last year, but when I saw that we finished fourth, I know we have a great chance, and we have nothing to be scared of,” said senior David Moenning, son of Amy and Joshua Moenning. “It’s unique this time around because we’re all so close, and it’ll be my last trip with these guys, so it’ll be awesome.” Durango’s boys team has won every race it has entered this season, so they’re used to finishing at the top. “The only thing I know is that I’ll remember it forever,” said Benjamin Lachelt, son of Gwen Lachelt and Trisha Rickey. “Whether we win or lose, I just hope we all enjoy it to the fullest.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:59:53.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
