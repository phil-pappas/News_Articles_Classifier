It is painful to watch such a talent struggle with an uncompetitive race car. \nKID IS ALRIGHT: Twenty-one-year-old Carlos Sainz suffered only minor injuries after a big crash in practice Saturday and it will be a race-time decision on whether he will get back in the Toro Rosso team car on Sunday. \nSPARKS FLY: A bumpy temporary street circuit at Sochi combined with full fuel loads will result in plenty of fireworks as the F-1 cars bottom out around the 19-turn, 5.848 km track. \nPRACTICE WOES: It will be interesting to see how the rain- and crash-shortened practices on Friday and Saturday affect the race strategy on Sunday. Certainly, tire management issues won't be a factor with so few practice laps. \nHOME BOY: Russian driver Daniil Kvyat will have plenty of fans around the Sochi circuit cheering on his No. 26 Toro Rosso machine. He will need all the help he can get after missing the final round of qualifying. \nRED BULLISH: With rumours swirling around the paddock that Red Bull is on the brink of pulling out of F-1, it will be fun to follow the soap opera in Sochi as attempts are being made to find a new engine provider for the Austrian team. \nBACK MARKERS: Besides Alonso, the back of the grid will have its usual inhabitants -- Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi -- in the Marussia/Ferraris. No reason to believe they will finish any higher than their starting positions. \nTHE CHAMP: Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton will start second on Sunday in Sochi behind Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, but that has never been much of an impediment for Hamilton. \nPICTURE PERFECT: Although it was cold and breezy for Saturday qualifying in the Russian Olympic city, forecsast for Sunday is for mostly sunny skies and temperatures near 20C -- making for perfect racing conditions. \nSITTING PRETTY: Roseberg has been there before -- on the front row ahead of Hamilton -- and it hasn't worked out. He will need to out race his teammate through the first lap if he has any chance of winning at Sochi. \nMY PICK \nNico Rosberg should be getting tired of getting his seat handed to him by Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. \nIt seems like every time Rosberg bests Hamilton on qualifying, the reigning champion finds a way to get past him on the first lap, often in the first turn, \nRosberg has been stung by criticism that he can't keep pace with Hamilton and he has to prove that theory wrong if he wants to break out of the two time champion's shadow. \nI think that will be motivation enough to push him to beat Hamilton on Sunday in Sochi at the Russian Grand Prix. \nRosberg likely can't catch Hamilton for the championship this season but a win at Sochi will at least keep him close. \nTHE BLIND SPOT \nRomain Grosjean has only one top five finish this Formula 1 season in the No. 8 Lotus Mercedes but his potential has been seen as impressive enough to earn a job next year in the inaugural Haas F-1 car. On Saturday he posted a lap of 1:38.787 for an eighth place spot on the grid for the Russian Grand Prix. A trouble free day could see him surprise.
