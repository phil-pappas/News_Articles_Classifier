Talking to a local media, Ashraf said that the Indian board in its statement had clarified that it had not extended any official invitation to the PCB. “The PCB chairman and Sethi went to Mumbai just on a courtesy call since there was no official agenda of the meeting, while the PCB was insisting for a meeting with the BCCI officials,” he said. According to Firstpost , Ashraf also said, “I think today the PCB officials have brought embarrassment for Pakistan and its cricket. The government must order them to return home immediately. Shaharyar Khan has been to India several times to meet with BCCI and their government officials, this time again he went there even after the recent events unfolding in India against Pakistanis”. Zaka also pointed out the current situation in an ongoing series between India and South Africa and said that it is not possible for India to host the World T20 and ICC should shift the event to other country.
