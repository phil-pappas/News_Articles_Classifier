Hartmann is out after Week 7. Others have played through injury, but the Knights still completed a second straight 7-0 run through Tri-Eastern Conference play. \n\"That's a tough stat,\" Roeder said of the lineup,\" but when you can say you're 7-0 and ran the whole conference schedule like that, I think it once again, big tribute to the guys, the defense. Words just really can't describe how proud we are.\" \nSomehow, the Knights still managed to win week in and week out, improving their TEC win streak to 17 straight games with Friday's 40-0 shutout victory over Union City. \n\"It's almost like we've been putting in a new lineup every game,\" said Roeder, who has 96 wins in his 19-year head coaching career. \"It takes a little while to get used to each other, so I think the one constant year after year has been the line, and the line play is what won it on both sides.\" \nThe line play for the Knights has been the most experienced, but the defense has been key, too, as they have posted back-to-back shutout victories. \nNortheastern's defense has allowed 7 points per TEC game, less than last year's 10.9. \nThe defense has helped make up for the loss of offense that graduated and left behind so many questions. \n\"Dakota Green is a rock on both sides (of the line) and Austin McNew plays offensive line, Chace Mosley, who's pretty impressive on both sides, (Friday) we had a freshman starting on one guard and a kid who had never played tackle played tackle,\" Roeder said. \"I just feel like I put a new lineup out there, we glue things together, so the tribute here is that despite all that, they're still finding ways to win. This is a team we say we'll always remember because of their heart. This is a heart team, this is a team that never gave up, we're just delighted in the way that the season went for them.\" \nFriday's win also puts the Knights in elite company, as they are only the third team ever to win three straight TEC football championships, after sharing it with Winchester in 2013 and winning outright the last two seasons. \nHagerstown won three straight from 1980-82 and Winchester shared the title with Hagerstown and Union County in 1986, before winning three straight from 1987-89. \n\"We're part of history and we're proud of that,\" Roeder said. \nTEC FINAL STANDINGS \nNortheastern 7-0 TEC, 7-2 overall \nWinchester 6-1, 7-2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:35:17.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
