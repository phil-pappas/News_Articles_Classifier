It's true that I had a bit of luck today, but I did well and I've got to keep it up. I'm in the best form of my career. \n\"I will try to be at my best and make things difficult for the coach [Spain manager Vicente del Bosque]. What I want is to maintain the line I had last season, when I think I was at a great level. It's tough to stay at that level, I want to keep growing and improving.\" \nSpanish media gushed with praise for De Gea's performance in Kiev. \nMarca wrote: \"The Ukrainian national team and people will be having nightmares about David de Gea for some time to come. \n\"The Yellow and Blues bombarded De Gea for 90 minutes, but the former Atletico star was a match for everything thrown at him - kitchen sink, table, cupboards and all. \n\"On no fewer than 10 occasions did Mykhaylo Fomenko's men hit the target, but each and every time De Gea - given the nod in place of the rested Iker Casillas - thwarted them.\" \nAS added: \"Stallone made films with less shots than this match in Kiev. What will go into the records was De Gea's performance. \n\"It's clear De Gea is a major figure on the way to completely overtaking Casillas.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:21:10.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
