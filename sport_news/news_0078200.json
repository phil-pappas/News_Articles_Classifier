(AP) - Pennsylvania's attorney general is disclosing more details of emails from a Supreme Court justice's private email account that she says are offensive to everyone in the state.\nIn a letter to the state's chief justice released Wednesday, Attorney General Kathleen Kane also criticizes a prior Judicial Conduct Board investigation of Justice Michael Eakin.\nThe board has described emails it saw last year from Eakin's private account as \"mildly pornographic or sexually suggestive.\"\nKane says she'll make many more public to show that \"in their totality\" they are worse than that.\nShe says one contains an obese, naked woman on all fours with a pig nose. Another depicts a passed-out college girl. A third shows a boy licking a nude Barbie doll.\nA spokesman for the chief justice says he forwarded the letter and attached emails to a lawyer hired to look into the matter.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
