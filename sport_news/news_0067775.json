( ThemeParkInsider )\nDisney will provide transportation from Disney Springs to the Studios for event participants, but it won't provide transportation back from the Studios to Disney Springs, so that's really only useful to Disney Resort guests who can catch a bus ride back to their hotel from the Studios. For participants who drive themselves to the Studios for the afterparty, parking at the Studios is included in the ticket price.\nTickets go on sale Monday on AMC's website .
