Page 1 of 3 The_Herban_Legend Well-Known Member I'll start, my team is the San Francisco 49ers and with the loss of several key components that have made us successful the past 4 years, and with Seattle squiring Jimmy Graham, we will be lucky to take 2nd in our division. GO 9ers!!! Thor_ Well-Known Member New England Patriots. Loss of our good secondary will hit us hard but not a big deal. If patriots are good at one thing it's adapting. If they play like they did vs the packers then we will be good. You could argue it's just pre season but Rodgers was going for it and was unhappy at not scoring. He had pretty much his team of starters. 11-5 and 1-1 in playoffs. ttystikk and v.s one like this. woody and texasjack like this. Yeah, I'm drinking the purple koolaid! Click to expand... CBDFarm Well-Known Member Would have said 13-3 if Green Bay didn't lose Jordy.but now i'd say 11-5. 2nd Seed. Now for my AFC team(I pick a NFC and AFC incase they ever meet in the superbowl and its happened for me already ) Will win the Super Bowl again this year. Click to expand... That's very optimistic. That secondary is going to have some big problems this season. Receiving core is bare and lacking in quality. If gronk gets injured which is highly possible then it's over. Pass rush looks better this year but not amazing. Guards and tackles look very meh at the moment. And pass rush def is struggling. If Jimmy ends up playing 4 games, don't be shocked if they go 0-4. His performance is so inconsistent, woeful one week then good the next. He nearly threw 2 picks in 5 plays last week. Mix into that a hard division for once. It will be a tough season indeed SourD420 and v.s one like this. puck1969 Well-Known Member Thor_ said: ↑ That's very optimistic. That secondary is going to have some big problems this season.

Hope the old bend but don't break holds this year! Thor_ Well-Known Member puck1969 said: ↑ Patriots will go 13-3 this year barring any injury to Brady or Gronk.

I don't see it myself, think people are underestimating how good afc East is this year. Secondary is ok and wr core is a little beat up. Might be missing most of the best wr they have for the start of the season. Best option i see atm is 2 te sets. Make good use of 2 good te. Brady is a top draw qb but he needs better weapons otherwise he will struggle.i also think the d-line will struggle too.think they are running 2 rookies and 1 second year. st0wandgrow Well-Known Member Thor_ said: ↑ That's very optimistic.

I wouldn't bet against them. TheHermit said: ↑ Barring any major injuries, I feel the Browns are fully capable of a 2-14 season. Click to expand... LOL!! I live in the dirty mitten, so naturally I pull for the Lions. I *think* they finally have a solid O line and a running game, which should equate to a good offensive year with their wide receiving core being one of the best in the game. Losing Suh hurts (even though he's a douche bag), but the D should still be solid. I've got them going 11-5, wildcard, and winning their first playoff game in eons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:19:18.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
