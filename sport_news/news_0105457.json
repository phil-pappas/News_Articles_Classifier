Michelle and Lexi are taller and bigger than I am and they are much more powerful than I am, but I notice that maybe my swing speed is a bit faster than them.\"\nLexi Thompson of the United States watches her shot on the third hole during the first round of the KEB Hana Bank Championship golf tournament at Sky72 Golf Club in Incheon, South Korea, Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) Photo Credit: AP \"I think today, I was especially lucky, but looking ahead to the next three days, I know that double or triple bogeys are a possibility,\" Park said \"So, it's really anybody's game at this point. I'm going to try to not focus on winning too much and really try to do my best.\"\nRanked 54th in the world, Park won the Korea LPGA's Se Ri Pak Invitational two weeks ago for her third victory of the season. She won the Korea Women's Open in June.\n\"It was awesome to watch, that's for sure,\" Thompson said. \"She shot 10 under, and I swear it seemed like she birdied every hole. It was amazing to watch. I've never seen her play before and she's a great player. Amazing putter and great ball-striker and she hits it long.\"\nThompson had a 68, and Wie shot 71.\nU.S. Solheim Cup hero Gerina Piller and England's Charley Hull were tied for second at 66.\nPiller had six birdies in a bogey-free round that started on No. 10.\n\"I just made some putts,\" Piller said. \"The greens are rolling pretty quick and they are pretty pure. I missed the green on the first hole and I had about a 10-footer (for par), so I think that just kind of kick-started the whole day.\"\nHull birdied five of the first seven holes in a bogey-free round.\n\"Just patience at the moment,\" Hull said.\nChina's Shanshan Feng was five strokes back at 66 along with South Koreans Chella Choi, Hyo Joo Kim, Eun-Hee Ji and Han Sol Ji. Kim and Choi won their first LPGA Tour titles this season. Kim took the Founders Cup in Phoenix, and Choi the Marathon Classic in Ohio.\n\"This tournament is my favorite tournament the whole year, because my hometown and my whole family came out here,\" Choi said. \"I'm so excited and I'm really proud of my country.\"\nTop-ranked Inbee Park had a 69. The South Korean star won two of the five majors this year and is tied with second-ranked Lydia Ko for the tour victory lead with four.\nKo also shot 69. She tied for second last week in the LPGA Malaysia after winning her previous two starts in Canada and France, where the 18-year-old South Korean-born New Zealander became the youngest major champion.\nAmerican Jessica Korda, the Malaysia winner, opened with a 71. U.S. Solheim Cup captain Juli Inskter, the oldest player in the field at 55, also had a 71.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
