They're like, 'you guys aren't doing anything. You're just kicking and hanging out.' \n\"Especially in the winter, we'll wear a couple more layers than the other guys will because we can. That's the fun part. As kickers, we can have a fun time.\" \nPuyol, a redshirt junior from North Palm Beach, Fla., enjoys the good-natured barbs. He also loves the pressure that comes with the job. \n\"I played baseball my whole life and played pitcher,\" Puyol said. \"I love the spotlight. ... The competitive juices start flowing and I love it.\" \nIn his second year as UConn's primary placekicker, Puyol converted his first nine field goals before missing a 44-yarder in Saturday's 28-20 loss to South Florida. \nAt the time, UConn trailed by eight early in the fourth quarter. His attempt hit the right upright and bounced out. \n\"The wind was kind of tricky Saturday,\" Puyol said. \"I feel like I might have aimed a little too far right and tried to play the wind. It felt really good. \n\"... Hey, I'm not perfect. Only one perfect person has ever walked the earth and that's Jesus.\" \nPuyol looks forward to starting another streak on Saturday at Cincinnati (3-3, 0-2). The Huskies (3-4, 1-2) are trying to snap a funk that's seen them drop four of their last five games. \nHe hopes to be a major factor. \n\"I'm excited for this week,\" Puyol said. \"I really feel we can do a lot and we're going to score a lot more and get a lot more opportunities to kick.\" \nAfter a bumpy start, the kicking game has been one of the team's strengths in recent weeks. \nPuyol had an extra point attempt blocked in each of the first three games. But he's been flawless since, crediting hard work in practice and more elevation on his kicks for his improvement. \nAs far as his field goal range, he says he's comfortable from up to 50 yards. Freshman Michael Tarbutt handles the kick-off duties. \n\"I'm ready for anything,\" Puyol said. \"Whatever coach (Bob) Diaco wants to do, I'm ready for.\" \nDuring his days at Dwyer High School in West Palm Beach, he set the school record by hitting a 54-yard field goal. He was 22-for-27 during his career and a finalist for the Palm Beach Placekicker of the Year award. \nPuyol began to focus on kicking his sophomore season. It was an easy decision considering he backed up Jacoby Brissett, now a starter at North Carolina State. \nPlus, at 5-foot-10, he's more physically suited to stand seven yards behind the line than right behind it. \nHe certainly doesn't regret the change. Even if it means he'll always be the subject of frequent barbs from his teammates. \nHe fires right back at them. \n\"We say we're assassins,\" Puyol said. \"We get one shot so we've got to do our business.\" \ng.keefe@theday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:02:53.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
