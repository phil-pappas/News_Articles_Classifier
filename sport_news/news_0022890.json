Made a stunning double save to keep out Junior Hoilett but will be embarrassed to have been beaten by a 40 yard free kick \nEdwin Gyimah- Was a bundle of activity at center back but looked uncomfortable on the ball and was targeted a s a weak point by the Canada. \nJohn Boye- Was the better of the two center backs and his ability to bring the ball out of defense was crucial for Ghana at time when the midfield was struggling. Almost scored a comical own goal . \nHarrison Afful- Was up against the pace of Junior Hoilett and was tested as all of Canada's best moves came down his flanks.He still found space to make forays and deliver crosses. \nJeffrey Schlupp- Was on holiday as Canada produced nothing from the left side. Kept his attacking instincts in check in a disciplined performance in the first half but was let loose to good effect in the second half. \nMubarak Wakaso- Started the game like a player who knew there were no stakes. Was poor in possession and offered nothing until Canada scored. Not a performance to be proud off for a player so normally consistent for the Black Stars. \nAgyeman Badu- Captain on the night complemented the poor form of his partner.Hopefully his performance will put an end to Grant's quest to turn him into a deep lying playmaker. Badu has not got the skills for the role and this game showed why. \nBernard Mensah- A bright light in the midfield. Was willing to show invention and thrust at a time when the team needed a creative spark. Neat interplay and a willingness to take risks bodes for a fine future. \nAlbert Adomah- it is baffling how Adomah consistently fails to sparkle in a Ghana shirt in spite of his magnificent club form. It is rare for a player to score a goal and still be the worst player on the pitch but the Middlesborough man managed it just fine. Needs to work on whatever Black Stars hex he has if he is to have a future. \nDavid Accam- Tried to use his pace but to little effect as he was watched like a hawk by the Canadian defense. Tried to do a little too much by himself and had little impact. \nJordan Ayew-Laid on the pass for Adomah's equalizer and put in a good shift inspite of the poor supply from his midfield. \nSubstitutesLloyd Sam- Never easy for a 31 year old making a debut but the Red Bulls flyer showed adventure as he created openings after replacing Adomah. Not a bad impression to leave. \nOfosu Ayeh- Another debutant. Looks a sturdy player and will fancy his chances of a recall in a competitive game especially as right back is one of the thin areas of the national team at the moment. \nKwadwo Poku- Showed some nifty touches in his debut. \nAbdul Majeed Waris - The Lorient striker has been among the goals recently but wasted a couple of decent chances in the dying embers of the game. \nFor more sports news visit allSports.com.gh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:13:34.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
