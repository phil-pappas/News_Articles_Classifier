( Hyoung Chang, The Denver Post ) Rosa Linda's will close Oct. 30, and its Annual Thanksgiving Feast to the Needy has been canceled.\n\"That is the thing that will hurt the most,\" said Rosa Linda, who opened the restaurant on Jan. 17, 1985, after her husband had been out of work for a few months.\nMany people in the neighborhood didn't believe the restaurant, which was built on family recipes, would make it, she said.\n\"But I always pray,\" she said, \"and I asked the Lord, if I make it to November, I will open my doors to the needy.\"\nThat Thanksgiving, Rosa Linda's served about 200 meals to people in need. Over the decades, that number grew to become a holiday tradition, with people in the community volunteering to deliver meals.\n\"Last year, we fed more than 6,000,\" she said.\nThat feast included turkey, green chile, rice and beans, served with the spirit of celebration.\nAlthough the restaurant at 2005 W. 33rd Ave. will close, the family hasn't yet decided what will go into that space. The cafe's neighborhood is rapidly changing, with posh restaurants and shops opening to cater to the condo boom in the trendy nearby Lower Highland neighborhood.\n\"We're not going to sell it,\" said Rosa Linda. \"We're keeping the building, the parking lot and the house next door. That's why we worked so hard.\"\nAs she looks back over three decades, Rosa Linda says she feels very blessed.\n\"Our customers became our friends, and my friends are now part of the family,\" she said. \"There are a lot of wonderful memories.\"\nColleen O'Connor: 303-954-1083, coconnor@denverpost.com\nGet news alerts in your inbox Sign up for updates and a curated roundup of news delivered to your inbox every morning.", "external_links": ["https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic", "http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1019/20151019__CD28ROSALINDASHC1_8282~p1_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:33:00.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
