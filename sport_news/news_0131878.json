United in the Eastern Conference. \nThe Revs (13-12-8, 47 points) extended their winless streak to four and missed a playoff-clinching opportunity in front of a regular-season record crowd of 42,947 at Gillette Stadium. \nWith one game to go, New England leads its only challenger for the final playoff position, Orlando City, by three points and has an eight-goal advantage in the differential tiebreaker. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:10:45.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
