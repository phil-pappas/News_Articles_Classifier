Fred Mitchell Contact Reporter \nNorthwestern's sudden descent is almost as surprising as its auspicious start to this season. At 5-2 overall and 1-2 in the Big Ten after a 40-10 loss to Iowa, there is plenty of time to redirect that arrow beginning Saturday at Nebraska. \nOffense \nD. For the second straight week, RB Justin Jackson was underutilized and the passing game proved ineffective. QB Clayton Thorson was intercepted once, lost a fumble and got sacked three times. The receivers had several drops. \nDefense \nD+. The once-dominant Wildcats defense has gone into hiding the last two weeks, giving up 294 rushing yards Saturday. LB Jaylen Prater did have a career-best game with 11 tackles and a sack. \nSpecial teams \nC-. Hunter Niswander averaged 38.2 yards on nine punts, and a couple of his shanks led to easy scores for the Hawkeyes. Jack Mitchell converted his only field-goal attempt. Matt Micucci sent a kickoff out of bounds. \nCoaching \nD+.
