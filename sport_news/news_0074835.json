The forward placed a shot into the top of the net, giving Liberty a 2-1 advantage with 15:12 left in the second half. \nTop performer : Meral was the definition of a super-sub for Liberty, providing instant offense during his time on the field. He scored his team’s opener by striking a bouncing ball near the top of the box to give the Hurricanes a 1-0 lead with 13:45 remaining before halftime. \nWhat it means : Liberty (10-1 overall, 8-1 Eastern Pennsylvania Conference), a winner of five straight and the second-ranked team by lehighvalleylive, keeps rolling. Freedom (9-4, 9-2) still has a lot to look forward to, including another meeting with their rival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:52:52.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
