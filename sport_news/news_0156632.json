But for the families of mariners aboard the cargo ship El Faro, the storm brought the terrible news that their loved ones were missing.\nAt a press conference on Monday morning , the United States Coast Guard confirmed that the cargo ship El Faro , which had been missing since October 1, sank near Crooked Island in the Bahamas. The ship’s owner, TOTE Maritime Puerto Rico, lost all communication with the ship last Thursday, and no one aboard has been heard from since.\nNew England was hit hard by the news, as Keith Griffin, of Winthrop, Massachusetts, was one of the crew members aboard , and four of the other crew members are from Maine: The ship’s captain, Michael Davidson, 53, is from Windham, Danielle Randolph, 34, and third assistant engineer Dylan Meklin, 23, are from Rockland, and Michael Holland is from Wilton. Crew member Mariette Wright, whose mother is from Massachusetts, was also on board, The Boston Globe reports .\n The AP reports that the crew communicated that El Faro had lost power, was taking on water and was listing to 15 degrees, according to TOTE Maritime, the ship’s owner. The crew added that the situation was “manageable,” before losing all communication.\nLast Thursday, crew member Danielle Randolph sent her mother, Laurie Bobillot, an email, according to The Washington Post .\n“Not sure if you’ve been following the weather at all, but there is a hurricane out here and we are heading straight into it,” Randolph wrote from the ship. “Winds are super bad and seas are not great.”\nAt Monday’s press conference, the Coast Guard’s chief of response, Mark Fedor, said that search and rescue teams found an emergency rescue suit that contained “unidentifiable” human remains, and that the teams are still looking for signs of life. They also found a heavily damaged lifeboat— one of the ship’s two, capable of holding 43 people each—but no one was on it and there were no signs of life.\n#BreakingNews @USCGSoutheast VIDEO Release: Lifeboat found in #ElFaro search area. pic.twitter.com/wzdd0OHls4\n— USCGSoutheast (@USCGSoutheast) October 5, 2015 “At this point in time, the entire TOTE Maritime Puerto Rico family is distressed that it now appears the El Faro sank at or near its last known position on Thursday October 1, 2015,” TOTE Maritime president Tim Nolan said in a press release.\n“We continue to hold out hope for survivors,” the release continued. “Our prayers and thoughts go out to the family members and we will continue to do all we can to support them. The efforts and assistance from the US Coast Guard has been extraordinary and we continue to be grateful for their dedication and efforts to find surviving crew members. TOTE Maritime Puerto Rico continues to work closely with the Coast Guard in ongoing search and rescue operations.”\n‘‘These are trained mariners. They know how to abandon ship. They know how to survive in the water,’’Fedor said at the conference. ‘‘Those are challenging conditions to survive.’’", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/USCGSoutheast/status/651080767536263168", "http://www.wmtw.com/news/reports-4-mainers-on-board-cargo-ship-lost-at-sea/35639464", "http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/10/05/mass-maritime-grad-board-ship-missing-cargo-ship/AL3ykGfbbBVD83VRENyyQL/story.html", "https://twitter.com/USCGSoutheast", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BreakingNews?src=hash", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/05/daughters-last-message-from-el-faro-there-is-a-hurricane-out-here-and-we-are-heading-straight-into-it/", "http://t.co/wzdd0OHls4", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ElFaro?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:11:00.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
