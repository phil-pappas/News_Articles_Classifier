Through their first three preseason games, the Griz have tipped off with Mike Conley, Courtney Lee, Jeff Green, Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol.\nGreen was the only starter who played against the Thunder, perhaps suggesting that Joerger is undecided about the small forward position.\n\"It's hard to say,\" Joerger said when asked if he's settled on a starting unit. \"I want to look at some guys at different positions and see who is playing well with who.\"\nThe wing positions seemingly have been up for grabs since training camp began. However, it's difficult to imagine a starting lineup without Lee; the guard easily has been the Grizzlies' most consistent and productive player in camp.\nLee is shooting 60 percent overall (12 of 20) and 62.5 percent (5 of 8) from 3-point range.\nGreen, though, is having an indifferent preseason. He performed well during the first week at the University of California at Santa Barbara. But Green appears to lack chemistry with Conley, Randolph and Gasol as he's struggled to consistently find driving lanes and make spot-up jump shots. Green has made 11 of 29 shots (37.9 percent) through four exhibition games.\n\"I'm going to go with whatever gives us the best chance to win. That's how I look at it,\" Joerger said when asked how he'll set his starting unit. \"I'm more concerned with how many minutes guys play and who plays with who.\n\"Our execution has to get better,\" Joerger said. \"We're going to keep working on that and get the shots that we exactly want. If not, get something easier because they're taking something away. It's just a process of building.\"\nJaMychal Green shines vs. Thunder\nBackup forward JaMychal Green returned after missing Monday's preseason game against Cleveland due to a sore elbow. His arm was almost in perfect form against the Thunder.\nGreen led the Griz with 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting to go with six rebounds after coming off the bench.\n\"And I don't run any plays for him,\" Joerger said. \"He's really worked at the corner 3, so I expected that one to go in.\"\nGreen will mostly be counted on as an energy guy to defend and rebound, although he displayed a variety of ways to score. He faced up and connected on midrange shots, scored in transition and excited the crowd with a putback dunk.\n\"I just tried to be all over the court and play my role in the offense,\" Green said. \"I know my spots. I know I have to just move around and keep the defense guessing. … I was rushing and thinking too much the first couple of games I played. I was calm in this game. It was good to see the ball go in.\"\nJoerger also lauded center Ryan Hollins. The Grizzlies have 15 guaranteed contracts. The team would have to waive someone to keep Hollins, which seems unlikely. But Hollins is making a case to stay in the NBA, according to Joerger.\n\"He and Courtney Lee have been the two best training camp guys we've had,\" Joerger said. \"They performed the best over the course of three weeks. With Ryan Hollins, it's the same guy you know you're going to get — the energy in the locker room, positivity and him flying around. It's what he did when he was with other teams we played against. … He's a great guy to have on your team.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGdVFLoztAk"], "published": "2015-10-17T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:25:25.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
