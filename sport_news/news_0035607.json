The Eagles are going full throttle, and defenses can often find themselves with the wrong personnel on the field - or even worse, 12 men on it. \nBut Spagnuolo said he is hoping the game officials can help make things a bit easier for the Giants. \n\"Here's where I'm going with that: By rule, by rule, when they change people - I'm talking about the Eagles - we're supposed to be allowed the opportunity to get our personnel in there,\" Spagnuolo said. \"Does that always happen that way in the game? Not always. ... It is a challenge, and we're going to have to pick our spots.\" \nSpagnuolo admitted it is a challenge for the officiating crew as well when working with an offense like the Eagles run. When it comes to changing personnel on the fly, Spagnuolo said the Giants will have to be smart about it, and determine if the potential reward is worth the risk. \nThe Giants did their best to replicate the speed of the Eagles offense in practice. Spagnuolo also thinks his defense's experience practicing against the Giants' offense during training camp in no-huddle situations could be a benefit. \n\"Our scout team offense and (backup quarterback) Ryan (Nassib) , I thought, did a good job today trying to get to it as close as we could,\" Spagnuolo said. \"I don't think you can get it exact, but our guys get the deal.\" \nMORE SPAGS : 'I still believe' in Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford \nHere are three other takeaways from Spagnuolo's Friday session with reporters: \n• On Trumaine McBride and Trevin Wade : Where the Giants are heading with their cornerback situation remains anyone's guess. \nTo recap: McBride, who was battling a groin injury, was pulled as the slot cornerback during the Giants' win over the 49ers and replaced by Wade. Coach Tom Coughlin told reporters McBride did not re-injure his groin after the game, suggesting Wade went in the game strictly for performance-related reasons. \nMcBride then was back on the injury report as a limited participant in practice on Thursday, and did not practice Friday with an illness. But Spagnuolo suggested McBride is still ahead of Wade ( and now the Giants' third cornerback with Prince Amukamara out ) when asked about Wade. \n\"Trevin Wade, he's a fierce competitor. I mean the guy loves playing football and goes out there and competes,\" Spagnuolo said. \"I think he'll fit right in there if he's got to go for [McBride].\" \nWill McBride be ready to go Monday? \"We hope. He didn't do much today. Jeez, we need to play with somebody,\" Spagnuolo said. \"We need somebody to go out there, so hopefully they'll all be there. We'll see.\" \n• On Darren Sproles : Spagnuolo had nothing but praise for the dynamic Sproles, who could give the Giants plenty of headaches at running back and in the return game on Monday night. \n\"He's probably one of the greatest guys I've worked with. We had him in New Orleans (when Spagnuolo was the Saints' defensive coordinator) and you talk about a character,\" Spagnuolo said. \n\"He's a challenge because of what he does. You see it. It's a linebacker on him, and he beats them all the time, and even safeties. So we've got to find the right people to do the right thing, to get some help somewhere, because he is a main featured guy in it, no matter what down it is. You can see they have special packages for him.\" \nMORE : Jon Beason rips 49ers' Alex Boone for concussion-causing 'coward move' \n• On Brandon Meriweather : When the safety-needy Giants signed Meriweather during training camp, it seemed like a desperation signing . But Meriweather, who came to the team with the reputation as a headhunter with a rap sheet full of fines and suspensions, has been a steady contributor who has not incurred a single penalty for an illegal hit. \n\"It's hard for me to say that there's a change (in Meriweather's style of play). I know what you're talking about and that's in the past, but it's not like I watched every play that Brandon played,\" Spagnuolo said. \"I don't know if those were just isolated plays, but look, we believe in aggressive football players, we don't believe in hurting people. \n\"But I think Brandon has played some good football for us and, again, I think the most important thing he's brought to us is he's able to settle things down, he's a smart football player, he's had a lot of experience, so that's been valuable.\" \nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.
