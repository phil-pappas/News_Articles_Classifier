The favorite Bee A Magician of Canada was sixth. \nThe 10 premier trotters in the world from six countries — including Italy and Sweden — competed for the richest trotting purse in New York state. \nTom Anderson and Claes Sjolin, the owners of Papagayo E., watched their 5-year-old stallion earn his 12th career victory in the final strides. \n\"Ulf gave him an absolutely perfect drive,\" Anderson said. \"I was confident going into the race.\" \nOhlsson said he liked the tempo and power of his horse. \n\"My biggest concern was Creatine holding on long enough until there was room for us to get through on the inside,\" he said. \nThe Yonkers half-mile oval last hosted the International Trot in 1995. The event was revived by raceway president and CEO Tim Rooney. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:51:08.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
