When asked why, Yost said, “I am just being a little bit of a punk.’’\nIs it possible that one of the four Royals starters is nursing a physical problem that needs to be monitored? Are the Royals debating pitching Johnny Cueto away from Kauffman Stadium after the Blue Jays spanked him in Game 3 of the ALCS at Rogers Centre?\nThere was no word of an injury, and Yost said he wouldn’t shy away from using Cueto at Citi Field when the Series shifts to Queens for Games 3, 4 and 5.\nIt’s likely that the order of Yost’s rotation will be Edinson Volquez, Cueto, Yordano Ventura and former Met Chris Young.\nAnd that doesn’t match the Mets throwing Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz.\n“They are hot and their pitching staff is dynamic,’’ Yost said of the Mets, who swept the Cubs in four NLCS games to get to the World Series for the first time since 2000. “The back end of the bullpen is very strong. These playoffs have been a real dog fight. against a great Houston team and a phenomenal Toronto team…. We don’t expect it to get any easier.’’\nBecause the Royals are in the World Series for the second year in a row and only Juan Uribe, who may not make the Mets’ roster because of a chest injury, and Curtis Granderson have been to the World Series, the experience edge goes to the Royals. Kansas City took the Giants to the final out of last year’s Series in Game 7 before losing.\nWhile Yost insists that hasn’t served as motivation for him, the sense of dread of coming that close was hard to shake.\n“I kept thinking in a week or two it would get better and it didn’t get better,’’ Yost said. “Then I thought in maybe a month it’s going to get better and it never got better. It never got better. You come that close to something that special and you don’t get it, it’s not a good feeling.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under kansas city royals ,  mlb playoffs ,  ned yost ,  new york mets ,  world series", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:55:11.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
