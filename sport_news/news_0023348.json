Lets go #Highlanders! #NEUFC @IndSuperLeague,\" the club tweeted. \nNortheast United FC are at the bottom of the table after losing the first two matches of the season. The Highlanders, in their first home game of the season, will look for inspiration from their fans to beat FC Goa tonight. \nOn the other hand, fifth-placed FC Goa will look to bounce back after losing at home to Chennai by four goals on Sunday. \nNortheast United FC's marquee player Simao Sabrosa in a recent interview had called his fellow country-man Ronaldo a \"hard working machine\". \nRonaldo, who recently won the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time, had said at the Golden Shoe award ceremony that he was hungry for more. \nHe said, \"I am not satisfied, I want more. I'm the only one that has four but I want the fifth and the sixth.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:02:27.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
