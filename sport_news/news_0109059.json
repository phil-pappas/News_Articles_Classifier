We’ll see how tonight goes. Everything I need to work on, this gives me a couple days to really work on it so I’m prepared for Tuesday.\"\nHoiberg said Rose would play two \"four- to five-minute stretches\" and play \"seven to 10 minutes\" overall. Rose's first stint will come as a reserve with Joakim Noah and Taj Gibson up front. The plan is to start him in the second half with starting big men Pau Gasol and Nikola Mirotic.\n\"I wanted him to play with different combinations. I talked to him about it. He seems to be very comfortable with the plan,\" Hoiberg said. \"He’s going to be rusty. There’s no doubt about it. He was in practice. But it’s all part of the process to get him ready for the regular season.\"\nRose, who fractured his left orbital bone on Sept. 29 and had it surgically repaired the next day, said he's excited to play. He will wear a mask, which took a blow in Thursday's practice with no damage.\n\"I’m excited,\" Rose said. \"I don’t know how I’m going to play. But I’m just happy to be running around and get a groove for the game.\"\nPrivacy Policy Derrick Rose Fred Hoiberg Chicago Bulls Taj Gibson", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a6422/turbine/ct-derrick-rose-preseason-debut-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:12:11.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
