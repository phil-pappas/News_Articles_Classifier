We’re just not good enough to play that way. We have to execute every single play.”South Cobb scored on the first offensive series of the game as it capped off a 10-play, 81-yard drive with a 27-yard touchdown pass from Michael Lapeyrolerie to Justin McLeod with 9:10 remaining in the first quarter to take a 7-0 lead.“It was a very positive start,” Rainge said. “We got the ball first, drove down and we scored, because we executed.”Things began to unravel for the Eagles on their next series as a punt from their own 45 was botched and traveled only five yards to midfield, where Douglas County’s D.J. Avery caught the ball and returned it for a touchdown to tie the game at 7-all.South Cobb began its next series on its own 34, but the Eagles committed two illegal block penalties and a holding penalty before fumbling the ball away to Douglas County at the Eagle 33.It took Douglas County only one play to reach the end zone as quarterback Deven Williams lateraled the ball to Chad Gooden, who threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Kenneth Reed to give the Tigers a 14-7 lead.South Cobb narrowed its deficit to 14-9 with 11:39 remaining in the first half when the Eagle defense threw Reed for a 2-yard loss into the end zone for a safety.After South Cobb was forced to punt with 4:27 left in the first half after a drive that was thwarted by two more penalties, Douglas County started the next series on the Eagle 15 and needed only four plays to score — with Williams’ 21-yard touchdown pass to Yassar El-Amin boosting the Tigers advantage to 20-9.Another botched South Cobb punt gave Douglas County the ball at the Eagle 6 with 5:09 remaining in the third quarter.The Tigers took advantage as Avery scored on a 6-yard run on the first play to make it 26-9.Another South Cobb turnover on its next series led to another Douglas County score as Austin Perry intercepted a Lapeyrolerie pass and ran it back 27 yards for the touch-down for a 33-9 lead.Lapeyrolerie threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to Javaris Harrell with 2:15 remaining in the game to help South Cobb cut its deficit to 33-15, but a 30-yard scoring run by Deon Rainey gave Douglas County its final margin of victory.“We have to clean up the mistakes and we have to work to be-come more efficient,” Rainge said. “It’s on me as a head coach to direct this program — I’ve got to get better. If I’m better, then I hope my players get better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:07:21.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
