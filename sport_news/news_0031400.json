Shawn Balluzzo accomplished the feat Saturday by finishing second to Robbie Babb in the Modified Division 75-lapper. \nThat gave defending division champion Balluzzo, a 59-year-old Hampton native, a six-point cushion over 2013 champion Babb in the final standings. With that, he moved ahead of the legendary Phil Warren, who won the last of his seven Late Model titles at Langley 14 years ago. \n“To surpass someone like Phil is an honor because I have so much respect for him,” Balluzzo said. “When I started, he was late in his career like I am now, and he helped me a lot when I knew nothing.” \nBalluzzo needed only to finish seventh in the race to win the title and break the record. So, when it was clear that pole-winner Babb had the fastest car -- as he has for the past two months -- Balluzzo, who qualified second, decided not to challenge him for the lead. \nHe fell in and drove behind Babb, who led all 75 laps. They pulled far away from the field quickly after the start, and following the restarts after the four cautions, with Babb pulling away from Balluzzo by about a straightaway by the finish. \n“I couldn’t have driven any slower tonight,” Balluzzo said. “We were just riding and trying to finish second (because) we didn’t need a win. \n“Just staying out of trouble.” \nBabb labeled his sixth victory of the season “bittersweet.” Babb wrecked out of the previous race and finished 13th, essentially killing his title hopes, and blames contact from Balluzzo on a restart for putting him in position to get into that wreck. \nBabb was so angry during that race, on Sept. 19, that he rammed his car into Balluzzo’s while the field was parked under a red flag. But Babb said this week he would not retaliate against Balluzzo in the final race and he kept his word. \n“There’s a lot of things I could say, but I’m just going to leave it at 'they know what they did and it’ll come around,’” Babb said in Victory Lane after the race. \nTitle No. 8 was perhaps Balluzzo’s most painful. In July he fell eight feet off of a ladder and onto the concrete while cleaning a gutter at his house, shattering a wrist in addition to suffering a multitude of cuts and bruises. \nOn Oct. 26 he’ll undergo knee replacement surgery, and he will need to have the other knee replaced in the next few years. But, even as he approaches 60, he has no plans to quit racing. \n“Eight is great but nine is not far behind,” Balluzzo rhymed Ali-like of his plans to win another championship next year. “We’ll be back.” \nSix other Langley Speedway champions were crowned Saturday. \nSuper Truck 25 \nBrad Adams won the pole, then won for the first time this season by holding off Bill Wallace. \nChase McAdams, a former Poquoson High wrestling state champion, finished fifth, which was enough for him to defend his division championship. \n“It was tough,” said McAdams, who hinted he might move to the Modified Division next season after seven years in a Super Truck. “We were chasing this No. 62 car all night. \n“This thing was crazy and my arms are tired. It was another great season and another great night of racing.” \nGrand Stock 40 \nBubba Johnston took the lead from pole-winner Rodney Boyd on lap 29, leading the final 12 laps en route to his first Grand Stock victory of the season and first racing victory in 15 years. \nJamie Sample, Tommy Sweeney and Mark Frye rounded out the top five. \nFrye’s fifth-place finish was enough to give him a three-point edge over Sweeney for the division championship. Sample was third in points. The Grand Stock title is the second consecutive for Frye, who has nine wins over the past two seasons. \n“It’s awesome (to win) two years in a row,” Frye said. “I can’t ask for anything more.” \nUCAR 25 \nMike Perkins passed Jesse Jones IV with two laps remaining to nab his first UCAR victory of the season. Jones, with five victories this season, won the championship by more than 30 points. \nEnduro 30 \nScotty Buchanan took the lead from Larry Drommerhausen on lap 4 and led the rest of the way for his third win of the season. Richard Quinn finished second to nail down his first division title. \nWinged Champ Kart 20 \nCharlie-Ray Lorah took the lead on lap 9 and drove to his third victory of the season. Lorah defended his division title and won his third championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:58:31.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
