This particular peak sent them soaring over mighty Utah. \nCameron Smith returned the second of his three interceptions 54 yards for a touchdown, and USC knocked the third-ranked Utes from the unbeaten ranks. \nRonald Jones II, Justin Davis and fullback Soma Vainuku rushed for scores to help the Trojans (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) snap their two-game skid and earn a victory for interim coach Clay Helton in his debut game at the Coliseum. \n\"These guys want to prove to everybody what type of team they are,\" Helton said. \"When we play together and play like we did tonight, they're a very hard football team to beat. There's a lot of talent in that room.\" \nCody Kessler passed for 264 yards and a touchdown and rushed for another score, while JuJu Smith-Schuster had eight catches for 143 yards and a fourth-quarter TD that wrapped up the win. The sounds of the Trojans' celebration could be heard through the walls of the Coliseum, where USC had lost its previous two home games. \nThe Trojans were outstanding in their first appearance at the venerable arena since an embarrassing loss to Washington and the subsequent firing of coach Steve Sarkisian. After Helton took over for last week's narrow loss at Notre Dame, he became the eighth straight USC coach to win his first home game when his Trojans dominated the Pac-12 South leaders. Advertisement \n\"It's been tough, and these guys have been pushed to the limit, but (Helton) has kept everything together,\" Kessler said. \"He has kept us family. It was a great win, but that's what we expect.\" \nSmith, USC's dynamic freshman linebacker, led a fine defensive performance by picking off Travis Wilson's throws and making three returns for a combined 122 yards, including his scoring romp down the USC sideline 1:07 before halftime. \nWashington State 45, Arizona 42: Washington State has been the punching bag of the Pac-12 for years and looked like it would be again this season after opening with a home loss to Portland State. \nThe Cougars have changed the script over the past month, inserting themselves into the Pac-12 championship conversation. \nLuke Falk threw for 514 yards and hit Gabe Marks on four of his five touchdown passes, helping resurgent Washington State beat Arizona. \n\"We didn't really have all the pieces tucked in and into place,\" Washington State coach Mike Leach said. \"We had good individual effort, but we really didn't play well early in the year. We've steadily improved on playing together.\" \nWashington State (5-2, 3-1 Pac-12) beat Oregon in Eugene two weeks earlier and tacked on another impressive road victory behind the arm of Falk to remain in the thick of the Pac-12 North race. \nThe sophomore completed 47 of 62 passes and had the most passing yards ever against Arizona, breaking the mark of 511 yards set by Arizona State's Ryan Kealy in 1998. \n-- ASSOCIATED PRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:29:11.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
