Still, good as Tretola played, the coach confessed that Tretola wasn’t Arkansas’ best offensive linemen against the Tennessee Volunteers in Knoxville. \n“I love Sebastian and I thought Denver (Kirkland, the junior left tackle) played really well,” Bielema said during his Monday press conference. “But (senior center) Mitch Smothers to me is the guy who played at another level that I haven’t seen before. Mitch Smothers probably played the best game of his career since I have been here. Not that he has played bad, but he was on point.” \nAnd not resting on his laurels. \n“ I had a conversation in my office this morning at 6:05 with coach (Sam) Pittman and around the corner came Mitch Smothers to get film work at 6 in the morning,” Bielema said. “That shows you where his mind is.” \nTretola, the 6-5 formerly 380-something -pounder upon last year transferring from Iowa Western Community College after first playing for the University of Nevada, has slimmed into the 320’s and fattened the the already outstanding reputation he established as a starter last season. Bielema said Tretola has consistently graded in the high 90s and graded that highly again after offensive line coach Sam Pittman reviewed the Arkansas vs. Tennessee film. \n“I have been around some really good linemen, man,” Bielema said. “He is a big body that has lost 60 pounds and he is playing as complete a football as anybody I have ever had in the interior line.” \nRight offensive guard Frank Ragnow who played through an injury against Tennessee, is not scheduled to practice Tuesday, Bielema said Monday, but should practice midweek and is expected to play against Alabama, Bielema said. \nJunior Josh Williams, a linebacker, underwent surgery Sunday to repair a leg he broke during the Tennessee game. Williams will miss the remainder of the 2015. \nBielema, defensive coordinator Robb Smith and linebackers coach Vernon Hargreaves will consider strongside options possibly even junior Brooks Ellis, a five-game starter this \nseason at either Mike or Will but now at Mike with freshman Dre Greenlaw from the weakside leading the team in tackles the last two games. \nBielema announced his best players after a victory awards Monday. \nThey included junior running back Alex Collins, 25 carries for 154 yards and two touchdowns and junior receiver Drew Morgan, five catches for 110 yards as co-Offensive Players of the Game with honorable mentions to senior quarterback Brandon Allen, junior tight end Hunter Henry and “the left side of the offensive line,” Bielema said. \nThird-year sophomore defensive end Tevin Beanum of Forrest City a fumble recovery, and a quarterback sack and another lost-yardage tackle among five stops, excelled for the second consecutive game. \n“Tevin is one of those guys that’s getting better for us every week,” defensive coordinator Robb Smith said. “He’s given us more and more each week from a pass rush standpoint. He also did an excellent job, in terms of stopping the run this week as well. And starting to become more of a complete player for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:10:37.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
