Afterward, Nelson said that the passing game, particularly in the red zone, needed more from the line.\n“The offensive line, myself in particular, needs to protect better,” Nelson said. “I’ll put that on me all day long.”\nNelson said the line could build on rushing for 195 yards against Ohio State defense but still had situational problems there. Ohio State finished with eight tackles for loss (three by Joey Bosa) and made some timely plays in Penn State’s backfield.\nIn particular, Nelson was disappointed with a third-and-2 stop for no gain in the fourth quarter. Hackenberg was sacked on fourth down.\n“We need touchdowns in the red zone,” Nelson said. “That falls on the offensive line. But the fact that we can move the ball on the No. 1 team in the nation, run-wise, that’s something to build on.”\nThe line also factored into coach James Franklin's decision not to attempt a 48-yard field goal in the first half. Franklin said that, because kicker Joey Julius' longer attempts have a low flight path, the pressure Ohio State's front was generating made the coaches fearful of a block.\nInstead, Hackenberg was sacked on fourth-and-eight, and the Buckeyes responded with a touchdown to take a 21-3 lead.\n\"They triple-teamed our right guard and knocked him back,\" Franklin said of the decision. \"Unless you're going to be really stout ... Joey has a tendency on long field goals, he can bang them, but they come out on a low trajectory. That was the situation right there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:40:09.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
