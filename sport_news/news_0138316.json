Or it might not end well for MacIntyre at Colorado.\nHere is the opportunity. Arizona will enter Folsom Field on Saturday night as a 7&frac12;-point favorite. Dual-threat quarterback Anu Solomon makes the Wildcats dangerous.\nBut this has to be the week, doesn't it? Now's the time when the Buffs can finally earn a victory that alleviates the frustration of players, keeps the dream of a bowl bid alive and allows MacIntyre to exhale.\nWe measure coaches by victories and defeats. That record, however, is far from the full measure of a man. And MacIntyre is a good man. The third-year CU coach wants desperately for the Buffs to taste success, so he does not have to see the hollow look of dejection that losing breeds.\nAdvertisement \"What hurts me most, honestly, is looking at the young men's eyes in the locker room, and looking at the coaches' eyes. They're blurry, because they've worked all week and there's no reward, so to speak. That really frustrates you the most and hurts you the most,\" MacIntyre said.\n\"Going home, sometimes I wish I was always in a good mood. But sometimes I'm not in a happy mood. I shouldn't let circumstances affect my mood, but I do.\"\nThe job of rebuilding the Colorado football program is difficult, far more difficult than believed when former athletic director Mike Bohn oversold the idea of leaving the Big 12 to compete against Oregon and Stanford in a new league. But the job is easy, compared with what the 50-year-old MacIntyre deals with upon leaving the office and going home to fight the same helplessness experienced by almost every man and woman in middle age.\nHis father is slowly fading in a battle with MS. His mother-in-law is wrestling with cancer ravaging her body, \"and I don't know how long she'll last,\" MacIntyre said. An icon on each side of the family recently entered the hospital with no assurances they would leave alive. Your parents are your rock ... until that time when illness robs their strength, and final goodbyes must be contemplated.\n\"Everybody goes through it. But nothing ever really prepares you for it,\" MacIntyre told me, describing the slow decline of George MacIntyre, the coach that a sports-loving son always wanted to be when he grew up.\nFootball is a game of hard knocks. Life's harder.\nPull the upset against Arizona, and the Buffs improve their record to 4-3. Upcoming dates at Oregon State and Washington State are certainly winnable. But if CU drops this one against the Wildcats and the confidence of players takes another blow, it's fair to assume MacIntyre's team might not be favored again this season.\nThe Buffs lost 10 times in 2014. Another 10-loss season this fall would make it tough for athletic director Rick George to sell optimism in a program that desperately needs buy-in from boosters for Colorado to have a shot at competing in one of the country's most unforgiving football conferences.\nBeating Arizona will not stop MacIntyre's father from dying.\nAs almost any middle-aged man can attest, however, some days the most you can hope for is reassurance there are still things in life that aren't so big as to be out of your control.\n\"I'd love to win a bunch of football games. I'd feel a lot better,\" MacIntyre said.\nWin or lose, MacIntyre will return home after midnight, as Saturday turns into Sunday, and be welcomed by the family pet. A dog doesn't keep score.\nBut, right here, right now, the CU coach needs a victory that sends everybody else at Folsom Field home happy.\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or @markkiszla", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:14:04.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
