Second-ranked Lydia Ko, No. 3 Stacy Lewis and defending champion Shanshan Feng tied for second. Korda finished at 18-under 266 at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club and earned $300,000. She opened with rounds of 69, 67 and 65 to take a two-stroke lead into the final round. Ko finished with a 66. The 18-year-old New Zealander was coming off consecutive victories in the Canadian Pacific Women 's Open and Evian Championship, where she became the youngest major champion. Feng also had a 66, and Lewis shot a 67. Top-ranked Inbee Park, the 2012 winner, had a 72 to tie for 15th at 7 under.
