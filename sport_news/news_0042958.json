The Purple Eagles finished the campaign at 7-28-4.\nNiagara will reverse the order of its opening games this year. Maybe that will lead to a reversal of their record.\nThe Eagles come into Friday’s game at St. Lawrence (7 p.m., Radio 1340) with hopes for better times. Niagara does have some firepower returning this season. Players who produced 71 percent of the team’s points are back.\nThe Purple Eagles warmed up for the game last weekend with an 5-3 exhibition win over Wilfrid Laurier University of Ontario. Defenseman Vinny Muto had a goal and two assists, while Nick Farmer added two goals.\nFreshman goalie Guillaume Therien is expected to be the starter for the Eagles tonight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:41:27.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
