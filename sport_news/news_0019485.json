The prosecution can then decide to either file charges, referring them to court, or it could dismiss the complaints with no charges.\nIn May, an administrative court ordered that the prime minister take the necessary measures to censor pornography websites inside Egypt.\nThe court's decision was theoretically enforceable but no steps were taken to implement the ruling. The decision could still be appealed at the Supreme Administrative Court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:46:24.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
