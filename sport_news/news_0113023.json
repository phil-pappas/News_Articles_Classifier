(Ann Heisenfelt/AP) \nIt’s a good thing health nut Tom Brady isn’t the quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings. If he was, the 38-year-old who derides the existence of Coca-Cola might not be able to join in on one of the team’s sweetest pregame rituals — the Donut Club. Apparently in existence since 2008, the Donut Club isn’t just for fun — it’s an integral part of team building. \n“You want to know the guys you’re playing with,” defensive end Brian Robison said (via ESPN ) this weekend. “At the same time, you want to make this game as much fun as you possibly can, because there’s times where it can be a grind. It’s just a way for us to come in, have fun with each other and have a good time.” \n— Eric Sugarman (@EricSugarATC) September 26, 2015 Donut Club President Eric Sugarman, the aptly named fellow who doubles as the team’s head athletic trainer, agrees. He added that the club’s weekly meetings at the team’s Eden Prairie, Minn., training facility is also a means for injured players to stay connected with the rest of the team. \n“It’s for the guys who aren’t injured to be able to support the guys who get mandatory treatment all week,” Sugarman told Sports Illustrated’s MMQB on Tuesday. He said the gatherings help create and maintain camaraderie in the training room, and the players take it seriously. \n“We just like to see commitment from guys,” linebacker Chad Greenway said. “We need to see proof that you want to be a part of this club and want to be part of something bigger than yourself.” \n— Eric Sugarman (@EricSugarATC) September 13, 2015 \nGreenway was around when the club accidentally first began after now-retired quarterback Gus Frerotte brought doughnuts into the training room one morning in 2008. He’s since watched it blossom into a full-fledged, governed organization. \nUnder Sugarman, Greenway, defensive end Everson Griffen and tight end Kyle Rudolph compose the executive board. Per MMBQ: \nEach board member has equal voting rights, a distinct role and a signature donut. Greenway (cinnamon twist) is the sheriff who enforces the rules. Griffen (glazed) is the speech-giver. Rudolph (chocolate long john) is in overall charge of planning and strategy. \nThere’s apparently more that goes into the Donut Club than just chowing down, too. For example, the meetings begin promptly at 7:50 a.m. each Saturday morning with a “viewing.” \n“Everyone is just allowed to look at the doughnuts,” Sugarman explained. This is when players can discuss which doughnuts they’d like to try. \nPlayers can finally touch the doughnuts at 8 a.m., but they can’t eat them until after the team takes a group photograph, listens to Griffen’s weekly speech and then toasts one another with their pastries. \n— Eric Sugarman (@EricSugarATC) October 3, 2015 \nAnd don’t even think about being late. \n“The Donut Club waits for nobody,” Sugarman said.
