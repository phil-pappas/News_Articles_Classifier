It has been living in a retention pond behind the Leighlinbridge subdivision at Gougar and Sweedler roads, Wazny said.\nThe pond is across the street from Wilson Creek Elementary School, 25440 S. Gougar Road. A paved walking path runs past the pond and leads to the crosswalk for the school. Wazny said a school official called parents Thursday night to alert them to the potential danger because students use the path en route to school. Members of the village staff helped escort children to school Friday morning.\nManhattan police and members of the Manhattan Emergency Management Agency patrolled the area after the sighting was reported. Wazny said the Illinois Department of Natural Resources planned to set traps and relocate the reptile.\nWazny said he had not seen the reptile as of Friday morning, but a patrol officer had. Wazny believes the animal may be a caiman, a species native to Central and South America. They can be bought as pets when small, about 6 inches, and kept in an aquarium.\nWazny believes someone intentionally put the animal in the pond.\nReptile on loose in Manhattan Erin Gallagher, Daily Southtown Police search Friday for a reptile, believed to be a caiman or small alligator, at a retention pond near Wilson Creek Elementary School in Manhattan. Police search Friday for a reptile, believed to be a caiman or small alligator, at a retention pond near Wilson Creek Elementary School in Manhattan. (Erin Gallagher, Daily Southtown) \"If they outgrow their aquarium and you want to keep them, you put them in the retention pond behind your house,\" Wazny said facetiously. \"It's that common sense thing.\n\"It gets more ridiculous,\" Wazny said. \"Several of the residents have been feeding it apples the last three or four days. Nobody thought to call the police, literally 20 yards from the crosswalk from the grade school.\"\nAuthorities did not know how long the animal had been there.\nErin Gallagher is a freelance reporter for the Daily Southtown.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56185b46/turbine/ct-sta-manhattan-reptile-loose-st-1011-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56185b47/turbine/ct-ct-sta-manhattan-reptile-loose-2-jpg-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:19:12.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
