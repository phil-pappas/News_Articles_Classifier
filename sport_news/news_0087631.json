I would have done it like six years ago. I can’t explain it. I can only thank [hitting coaches] Kevin Long and Pat Roessler for the work that they’ve put in with not only myself, but with all the guys hitting. I wish I could explain it. I can’t.”\nSome others tried.\n“From my perspective, it pretty much doesn’t matter who is pitching right now,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. “Obviously, if you look at the line of pitchers that he’s hit home runs against, he’s just in one of those moments.”\nAnd fortunately for the Mets, that moment has stretched for the better part of two postseason series.\n“It’s fun to watch,” Wright said. “Being a hitter, I understand how difficult it is to do what he’s doing, to continue this hot streak for 10 days or whatever it’s been. I mean, it’s impressive doing it off these pitchers.”\nEven Mets manager Terry Collins, who has been in the sport virtually his entire adult life, couldn’t come up with a similar success story.\n“I’ve watched a lot of baseball over the years [and] I don’t think I’ve seen anybody put on this kind of a show on this stage like he has so far,” Collins said. “I mean, even the guys in the dugout, they’re baseball guys too, and they’re saying the same thing.”\nAnd from a player never known for his power, it’s all the more stunning.\n“[The] question is: ‘Who is this guy?’ ” Collins said. “I mean, he’s been unbelievable. So hopefully he just keeps it up for certainly a few more games.”\n  chicago cubs ,  daniel murphy ,  david wright ,  joe maddon ,  kevin long ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:59:54.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
