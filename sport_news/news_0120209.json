The Mets will play the Royals.\nThe Cubs lost to the Mets despite being the historical favorite thanks to a time-traveling Marty McFly in Back to the Future II . The Blue Jays may have lost to the Royals because of a time-traveling Abraham Lincoln, who may or may not (totally did) have interfered with a non-home run ball, turned it into a home run and got away with it.\nWhere there is victory, there is defeat. And where there is defeat, there is a sad guy who has to pay off a debt.\nIn the case of Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Mets topping the Dodgers in the division series meant he owed Rep. Steven Israel (D-NY) a rendition of Meet the Mets on the House floor .\nYes, you read that right. Members of Congress agreed in advance to waste valuable time on the floor of the House of Representatives to square a bet with each other instead of trying to accomplish things relevant to more people than just themselves.\nThis is what happens when the House of Representatives doesn't have a leader .\nSchiff was right about one thing, though. No matter what, we can all be happy that at least it wasn't the Yankees.\nNew old music Today's music will one day be old. If you're someone who grew up listening to, say, Garth Brooks you already know this. He gets relegated to the oldies station now. Why?!\nBarbershop quartets are known for doing mostly old music, but one group realized it won't be long before current music is old. Their rendition has been popular on the internet, but only earned them third place at the Barbershop Harmony Society Convention, which apparently is a thing that exists.\nThey finished only 0.3 points behind the winner. YWVV is assuming that's rare and noteworthy, but really has no idea.\nThe first and second place videos do not appear to be on YouTube, so let's just assume they're not as good.\nOh, look, a kitten A kitten fell out from underneath a car and a nearby motorcyclist picked him up .\nIt's hard to see, but according to the woman in the video the red car that passes by starting at the 12-second mark deposits a kitten into the road, presumably on accident. The poor little guy is sitting in the middle of an intersection until the one-minute mark and remains remarkably unharmed by the passing cars until he's rescued.\nShe named him Skidmark , and he seems to be doing pretty well.\nBongo Bernie There's a presidential election going on, and there will be for another year.\nBernie Sanders has been getting some interest since he said \"ya damn emails\" to Hillary Clinton during the Democratic debate.\nSanders has a few defining characteristics, the most notable of which may be that he has \"an ample supply\" of underwear .\nHe also moves his hands a lot, as if he's playing the bongos or something.\nAnimal of the Week It's fall. There are piles of leaves. There are also dogs to jump into those piles of leaves .\nIt's difficult to say what the best part of this video is because it's all great. It's only a minute long, but you could watch 10 minutes of it and not get bored.\nMore stuff for when you’re bored Did you know Adele has a song? Have you been on the internet at all in the last two days? If so, you know Adele has a new song. In Adele's new song, Adele sings. In two days, more than 34 million people have watched Adele sing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A\nWhen you fling a ball filled with water, water comes out of it. When you film it with a slow motion camera, you can watch it in slow motion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVo2qdXxQ7o\nWhat good is a plastic dinosaur diorama if you can't fly over it? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGPAKBOz9ag\nBig dog. Little kitten. The wrong one is scared. But in his defense, the thing just won't shut up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW-3XDDloXU\nTwo dogs disguised themselves as stuffed bunnies and hilarity ensued. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfP2InnIoes\nFor additional videos and occasional nonsense, visit Twitter at @BNT_RNN .
