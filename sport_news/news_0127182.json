The cancellation happened after Sena workers allegedly threw ink on function organiser and chairman of Observe Research Foundation Sudheendra Kulkarni, blackening his face.\nMani Bhavan, a modest two-storeyed building on Laburnum Road in the comparatively quiet locality called Gamdevi, served for about 17 eventful years (1917-1934) as the nerve centre in Bombay for Gandhiji's activities. It belonged to Shri Revashankar Jagjeevan Jhaveri, an ardent devotee of Gandhiji and his affectionate host during that period. Today, Mani Bhavan is a hallowed memorial to Gandhiji, to his stay here and to the activities he initiated from here.\nAs per the schedule, the Mani Bhavan administration got a call on Sunday, informing that Kasuri would pay a visit on Monday 2pm. But later, four police vans were seen parked outside the premises, and shortly after, the administration announced that the visit had been cancelled.\nEvery year, more than 3 lakh foreigners visit Mani Bhavan. Over the past few years, more than a thousand Pakistanis have visited the place.\nExecutive secretary of Mani Bhavan Gandhi Sangrahalaya Meghshyam Ajgaonkar said, \"We got a call from the state government's protocol department, saying Mr Kasuri would visit on Monday. But for some reason, it was cancelled.\"", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/1/110073433974965853581/posts"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:24:01.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
