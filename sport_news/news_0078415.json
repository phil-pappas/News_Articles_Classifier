Some kids decided the middle of their football game was a good time to break into dance .\nSome questions need to be asked. First, are these kids trying to dance while playing football or trying to play football while dancing? Why is the music playing during the game in the first place? How does the offense not score easily on this unfocused defense?\nWhich college/pro team will be the first to implement this innovative Nae Nae defense? It has to be the Cleveland Browns, right? They're currently last in the NFL in yards per game allowed, so it can't hurt.\nCar-mageddon If you're a civil engineer, this video will drain you of your soul.\nAn epic traffic jam in China was recorded from overhead and it's a complete nightmare. As you can see in the video, a checkpoint was installed in the middle of the highway and it killed traffic flow.\nThis video raises questions too. First, how wide is that highway? The traffic in the video is 40 cars wide and there don't appear to be any lane markers. That's complete automotive anarchy.\nAnd why do so many people in China drive white cars? According to Wikipedia (always reliable), only about 20-25 percent of cars on the road are white, but there's a lot more than 25 percent white cars here. Maybe silver and white just look the same? Is it possible white cars are attracted to traffic jams?\nThis doesn't need to be said, but if you're ever in China, just take the bus.\nNetflix and fight Netflix sounds like a good idea, but no one wants to watch the same thing. You want to watch something good and funny while the person with no taste next to you wants to watch some romantic nonsense just like every other romantic nonsense ever made.\nYou rightfully insult this person's terrible taste to which they take offense for no logical reason whatsoever and then insult your entertainment choices, which are impeccable and expertly nuanced.\nThat's not very chill . There's now a solution for that .\nOut of proportion When Norwegian bodybuilders can't get any bigger, they just go somewhere smaller to give illusion of being big.\nFrom what little can be deciphered, this is a Norwegian TV show. Norwegian TV is either much better or much worse than American TV. We're going to go with better.\nAnimal of the Week Cheetahs and dogs get along well together . It's odd to see a dog outrun a cheetah, but that probably won't last. It also won't last that the dog isn't harmed by getting slapped in the face by the cheetah. But for now it's cute.\nMore stuff for when you’re bored Vote for science. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e1XX-ngJcc\nSome food from around the world is palatable to children, but most is not. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmOGqOG8SbI\nIf you plan on launching a tire into the air using air bags, be sure the tire isn't going to come down on something that will be seriously damaged. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfgxAL3t2Tw\nA little kid and his dog competed to see who could be more excited over dad getting home.
