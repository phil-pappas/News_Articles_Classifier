They beat UMass (15-10) last week, so that was a good one. I’m proud of them. “They had a rough start to the season, but I think if they keep on playing well (after dropping three of their first four, the Golden Flashes have rebounded to win two of their last three) they’ll do well in the MAC (Mid-American Conference). But the MAC is tough this year. They’ve got a lot of good teams.” When it comes to college football, bragging rights are often on the line in the Patriots’ locker room. Last Friday, on the eve of Louisiana State’s Southeastern Conference game with Florida, former Tiger Brandon LaFell exchanged good-natured barbs with ex-Gators Jonathan Bostic and Dominique Easley. On Wednesday of this week, in the wake of a 35-28 victory that kept the Tigers unbeaten, an LSU sweatshirt hung in Bostic’s locker at Gillette Stadium, an LSU T-shirt was draped in Easley’s. That was a “been there, done that” experience for Joe Cardona. Earlier this month, after Navy absorbed a 41-24 loss at the hands of the Fighting Irish, the former Midshipman wore a Notre Dame T-shirt as he prepared to head out to practice, his debt after losing a friendly wager with Darius Fleming, who played his college ball in South Bend, Ind. “It’s a very friendly rivalry between Navy and Notre Dame, The two schools’ histories have been linked in so many ways that if there’s a rival shirt to wear, I’d want it to be Notre Dame’s,” said Cardona, who only a year ago was long snapping for Navy. “As long as it’s not Army or Air Force.” Center David Andrews has a Bulldog attitude (hometown Johns Creek, Ga., and a three-year starter over a four-year career at Georgia). “That was a big part of me growing up, being a Georgia fan, so no matter whether I’m here or wherever I am, I’m still going to watch them and care about them,” said Andrews. “I’ll always have an interest.” Yes, they’re true to their schools. “We definitely keep up with our alma maters,” said Kline. “It gives you something to look forward to on a Saturday before the game.” As Ryan Allen said of Louisiana Tech, where he was a two-time Ray Guy Award winner as the top collegiate punter in the nation: “That’ll always be my alma mater.” Page 2 of 2 - Four still out: Offensive tackle Marcus Cannon (toe), linebacker Rufus Johnson (illness), guard Shaq Mason (knee) and defensive end Jabaal Sheard (ankle) all missed their second straight day of practice for the Patriots on Thursday. Running back Brandon Bolden (hamstring), defensive end Trey Flowers (knee/shoulder), linebacker Dont’a Hightower (ribs), Kline (shoulder), running back Dion Lewis (abdomen), wide receiver Keshawn Martin (hamstring) and special teamer Matthew Slater (knee) were all limited. Bolden and Martin were additions from the previous day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:27:11.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
