The No. 15 Cardinal has won the past seven meetings with the Bruins, including the Pac-12 title game on Dec. 1, 2012, the final score 27-24. \nThursday's date with No. 18 UCLA (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) may not carry the weight of a conference championship game, but the way the Pac-12 standings have fallen in favor of Stanford (4-1, 3-0 Pac-12) of late, this game is monumental. The preseason favorite, Oregon, is 3-3, 1-2 in the Pac-12 and has dropped out of the top 25. Cal, another challenger in the North, lost its first conference game Saturday, leaving Stanford the only unbeaten in North play. \nKickoff is 7:30 p.m. with the game televised on ESPN. Stanford free safety Kodi Whitfield expects Stanford Stadium to be buzzing. \n\"It's going to be a packed house,\" said Whitfield, who attended Tuesday's press conference riding a MonoRover, an electric two-wheel scooter. \"I told everyone they can take off from studying for mid-terms this week. They're all going to be there.\" \nStanford football coach David Shaw, in his fifth season, is trying to keep his team on an even keel. \n\"Every conference game is big,\" Shaw said. \"They are all hard to measure. If you win them, they get bigger. The goal is to keep finding ways to win games and keep ourselves in position in our conference. We try not to get our gaze anywhere outside of our conference. Our conference is tough enough. Now it's a very good opponent, very athletic and capable of playing very well. We have to play our best game.\" Advertisement \n\"We have a great opportunity to continue to prove our dominance in the conference,\" Whitfield said. \"We want to prove we're a great team. Really, it's another step in the direction of achieving that goal, which is winning the Pac-12 championship. The next game is the biggest game.\" \nShaw doesn't believe having beaten the Bruins seven times in a row gives the Cardinal a psychological advantage. \n\"Most people who had a hand in most of those games aren't on either team,\" Shaw said. \"What happened last year or the year before that doesn't matter. We talked about it with USC. They had beaten us two years straight.\" \n\"We're 0-0 against UCLA this year,\" Whitfield said. \"Those past seven games are in the past. They have nothing to do with this upcoming game. UCLA is a great team. This game is going to be a special one.\" \nStanford, normally one of the best teams in the nation at sacking the quarterback, has just six sacks this year, tied for last in the Pac-12. The Bruins have allowed just four sacks, second fewest in the conference behind Utah. It would behoove the Cardinal to try to put pressure on UCLA true freshman quarterback Josh Rosen, who has thrown for 1,243 yards and nine touchdowns. \n\"Putting pressure on Rosen is the hard part,\" Shaw said. \"He gets the ball out quick. They have a lot of screens where they throw the ball out quickly. They have a couple of really good running backs, so you need to be careful to try to blitz them too much. One of those runs will crack you for a big play. For a young quarterback, he does a good job of getting rid of the ball, throwing it away when he needs to. We will change our looks, but we need to make sure everyone plays their responsibilities. The best way to get a sack is to have great coverage and not give the quarterback a place to throw the ball. Bottom line, we have to slow them down.\" \nWhitfield went to the same middle school as Rosen at Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Peninsula in Southern California. Rosen prepped at St. John Bosco in Bellflower, while Whitfield attended Loyola High in Los Angeles. \n\"Josh is playing really well,\" Whitfield said. \"We played them in high school. He's really polished. It's rare you see a freshman do the things he does. He has a great arm. He is one of the best guys in the Pac-12 throwing the deep ball. I love the guy and have a lot of respect for him.\" \nWhitfield is the son of Bob Whitfield, an All-American offensive tackle at Stanford (1989-91), who went on to play 14 seasons in the NFL, most of them with the Atlanta Falcons. \n\"I'd love to tell you I made the decision to come to Stanford myself,\" Kodi Whitfield said. \"My dad kind of swayed me. Being exposed to Stanford football for so long, I always wanted to come here.\" \nWhen he was younger, Whitfield played an NCAA video game. \n\"I used to always play with Stanford, if that counts for anything,\" Whitfield said. \nStanford has just one interception through five games, ranking it last in the Pac-12. \n\"Turnovers come in bunches,\" said Whitfield, who made a successful transition from wide receiver to safety. \"You saw it in Utah-Cal game. We have to stay patient and do our job. Interceptions will come.\" \nUCLA running back Paul Perkins has rushed for 577 yards and seven touchdowns, averaging 5.8 yards per carry. \n\"You look at Perkins and you can't find anything he can't do,\" Shaw said. \"He's Stepfan Taylor-like. Is he quick enough? Yes. Can he run through arm tackles? Yes. Can he make a guy miss? Yes. Can he make a big play? Yes. I don't know why his name doesn't get brought up with the best backs in the nation or with the best backs in our conference. When they get more yards than the plays blocked for, that's the sign of a good running back. He'll have eight years in the NFL, at least. He doesn't take a lot of good shots because he's shifty and has great body control.\" \nThe Bruins have two quality receivers in Jordan Payton and Thomas Duarte. Payton has 25 receptions for 392 yards and three scores, while Duarte has caught 18 passes for 274 yards and four touchdowns. \n\"Payton makes highlight catches and big plays in critical downs,\" Shaw said. \"He's a red zone threat, a run-after-catch threat. He has been a big-play receiver for them for years. Give Rosen credit for giving them catchable balls.\" \nThe college football world was rocked on Monday when USC fired head coach Steve Sarkisian and South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier announced he was retiring immediately at the age of 70. The Gamecocks were 2-4, 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference East. \n\"It's a crazy world,\" Shaw said. \"Things happen. With our profession, you can't be surprised. Coach Spurrier had success for so many years, but he has displayed the attitude that 'I want to do what is right and what I want to do. I'm going to enjoy my time doing it.' I have a lot of respect for him. I'm sad to see him leave in this way.\" \n\"The coverage units have been outstanding,\" said Shaw about his special teams play. \"We have a couple of first-time kickers and punters doing a good job placing those balls. Return-wise, we have multiple dynamic returners who haven't gotten the chance to get loose, yet. We have had a lot of high punts, rugby punts, rolling punts, partly because what Christian McCaffrey is and what he has put on film. It's a sign of respect. We can improve on our returns.\" \nStanford's homecoming game is on Oct. 24 vs. Washington, the announced time 7:30 p.m. It will be the fourth home game with a 7:30 p.m. start. \n\"Are we allowed to have an afternoon game?\" Shaw quipped. \"It has a lot to do with TV and how many eyes get to watch the game. It's difficult because I have three kids 12 and under. We have a lot of late-night football games. We're talking about these guys getting back to their dorm rooms at 1 o'clock in the morning. It's not ideal, but we have to make the best of it.\" \nShaw addressed the problem of late games causing problems for fans coming from out of town, especially for homecoming. \n\"We have a lot of alums that come to a lot of our games from Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego,\" Shaw said. \"From the Northwest. It makes it a tough trip. It gives them difficult decisions to make, like whether to get a hotel for the night.\" \nStanford quarterback Kevin Hogan used the time off to help heal his ankle, tweaked in the Cardinal's game at USC on Sept. 19. \n\"Kevin Hogan feels a lot better,\" Shaw said. \"He looked better than he did a week ago.\" \nPalo Alto grad Kevin Anderson, a starting outside linebacker, will be held out of Thursday's game, Shaw said. It is the third straight game Anderson has been sidelined while an injury heals. \n\"I don't think Kevin will be out for an extended period of time,\" Shaw said. \"He's making strides and is coming back. He's moving around. He should be back in the next couple of weeks.\" \nEmail John Reid at jreid@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at twitter.com/dailynewsjohn .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:02:28.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
