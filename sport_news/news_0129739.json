Vaughn and Bennett both went on to win the Mountain West's Freshman of the Year award.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, UNLV head coach Dave Rice said the 7-foot center from Bishop Gorman High School will be a \"big part\" of the team's plans this season.\n\"He's an extremely versatile and coachable player, there's nothing on the basketball floor he can't do\" said UNLV coach Dave Rice at Tuesday's annual conference media day . \"But as good as Stephen is, he embodies team and comes with a quality work ethic.\"\nZimmerman's teammates echoed the UNLV coach, saying the 19-year-old freshman has earned players' respect in just a few short months on campus.\nHeâ€™s a great all-around player, he just makes everyone on the floor better,\" said senior guard Jerome Seagears. \"I think he's going to live up to the hype.\"\n\"He fits in and everybody gets along with him,\" said sophomore guard Patrick McCaw. \"He doesn't brag about his game too much and he's actually a pretty cool dude.\"\nContact Chris Kudialis at ckudialis@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4953.
