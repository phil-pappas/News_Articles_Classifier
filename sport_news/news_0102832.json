Lose and fall to 2-5 and big change could be on the horizon in Washington. \nWe take a look at the key matchup (yes, singular) going into Sunday's tilt with the Bucs: \nQB Kirk Cousins vs. QB Jameis Winston \nThrow out every other match up in this game because honestly, in the grand scheme of things, only one matters; the struggling Kirk Cousins versus 2015 number one overall pick Jameis Winston. \nFirst, let's recap Cousins' past two weeks. \nOn October 4, Cousins completed 21-32 passes for 219 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions in a loss against the Atlanta Falcons. Cousins' first pick was \"unlucky\" as the ball bounced off a sliding Pierre Garcon's hands and went right into the hands of Atlanta's Robert Alford. \nBut the next interception cost his team the game, literally. After leading a four play, 46-yard drive that resulted in the game-tying field goal as time expired, Cousins threw a pick-six on the seventh play of overtime. Falcons win 25-19. Game over. \nFast forward to October 11 and a week six showdown against the Jets in New York. A banged-up Redskins squad battled to a 13-10 halftime lead. CB Bashaud Breeland forced three turnovers, and Cousins played a solid half which included zero turnovers and a two-yard touchdown strike to WR Pierre Garcon. \nBut a different Kirk Cousins and Redskins offense emerged from the locker room at the start of the third quarter. On his first possession of the second half, Cousins threw an ugly pick to all-pro corner Darrelle Revis. The throw came late (very late), violating the league's unwritten rule on Revis: \"You do NOT throw late towards Darrelle Revis.\" On the very next play, Jets QB Ryan Fitzpatrick scampered down the middle of the field for a 18-yard touchdown run and the Jets took a 20-13 lead and never looked back. \nCousins threw another interception two possessions later which lead to the Jets' knockout blow, a two-yard touchdown pass to WR Eric Decker, giving the Jets an insurmountable 34-13 lead with less than a quarter to play. Cousins finished the day with numbers eerily similar to the Atlanta game; 23-45, 196 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. \nSo why is this the only match up that matters this week? Because this is a game for Kirk Cousins to silence the critics and take a step forward instead of taking another giant step back. There is a common theme in the Redskins' four losses this year: Multiple turnovers by Cousins. Captain Kirk has thrown two interceptions in each of his four losses this season. And in Washington's two wins in 2015, Cousins has thrown zero picks. \nSimply put: If Kirk takes care of the ball, the Redskins win. \nJameis Winston has had a typical rookie season thus far, throwing for seven touchdowns but also throwing seven interceptions and losing three fumbles. He has the sixth-lowest QBR in the league at 38.4 and just like Cousins, all seven of his interceptions have come in the Bucs' three losses this season. \nThis is a game where Cousins needs to outplay Winston. Cousins needs to validate why he was chosen over both Robert Griffin III and Colt McCoy for the starting quarterback job, and that he is more than capable of leading the offense. Getting outplayed by a struggling rookie could spell trouble on the horizon for Cousins. \nWe've heard Gruden's confidence in Cousins the entire season: He can make all the throws, he is the quarterback for the system and so on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:13:47.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
