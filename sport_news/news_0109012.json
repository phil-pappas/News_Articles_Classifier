We’ve played against each other since 2003 so there’s been a few contests and unfortunately I’ve been on the losing end most of the time,” Burger said \n“Hopefully for me we can get a win over them and it will give me some bragging rights for it will be one of the last days we play against each other. \n“We play a bit of a different style. Both of us have a massive work-rate so we find each other on the bottom of rucks or tackling or carrying the ball a hell of a lot. \n“I always try to make a bit of a chat on the field but it’s pretty difficult to do with Richie. But afterwards we’ll share a beer and reminisce about days gone by.” \nSpringbok wing great Bryan Habana needs just one more try to break the overall World Cup record of 15 tries he now shares with New Zealand star Jonah Lomu. \n“If it happens in the game, I don’t think we’ll be thinking of the record, we’ll be thinking we’ve scored against the All Blacks,” said Burger. \n“I hope we can create something special for Bryan. He has got the ability to score that 20 percent try, the one that comes out of nowhere.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:15:44.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
