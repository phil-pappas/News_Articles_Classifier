Your answer, please, Mr. Kessel. \n“I don’t even know,” he replied the other day. “I couldn’t tell you where it was. I remember my first goal vaguely, but that’s it. \n“It’s been a long time, right?” \nSince your first game in the league? Or your final game as a Maple Leaf? \nBoth seem like another lifetime ago, don’t they? \nFor Phil Kessel, they probably do. \nSince trading him to the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 1, the Toronto Maple Leafs have moved on. They lost their season opener to the Montreal Canadiens 3-1 on Wednesday night at the Air Canada Centre. Only 81 more to go. That’s the way it works. \nKessel, meanwhile, has turned the page on the Toronto chapter of his tumultuous Toronto career too. On Thursday night here in Dallas, he made his Penguins regular-season debut against the Stars. His colours were now gold, black and white, not blue and white. His centre was Sidney Crosby, not Tyler Bozak. Not once during training camp was he asked if he hated his coach. How bad could life be right now? \nOk, maybe it would have been better if not for Antti Niemi in the Dallas net. \nKessel arguably was Pittsburgh’s best player on this night. He was fast. He was shifty. He had the Penguins’ first shot of the season in the game’s opening minute, then he had their final one 58 minutes later. In the end, he had six of Pittsburgh’s 37 shots. \n“He had tons of chances,” Crosby said. “We all did.” \nAnd Niemi stopped them all. \nThe result was a 3-0 Dallas victory that, frankly, was not a true indication of how the game went. Maybe the Penguins deserved a better fate. But that wasn’t going to happen when Niemi was the best player on the ice. \n“We had so many good looks,” Kessel said. “I like the chances we created. The goals will come. We just ran into a hot goalie.” \nNiemi, by the way, chipped in with two assists. He now leads Kessel, Crosby and Evgeni Malkin by two points in the scoring race. \nIt was that type of night for the Penguins. \nLet’s start with the fact that the Penguins were still in the dressing room when the singer started the rendition of the Star Spangled Banner. Maybe someone had forgotten to tell the visitors it was time for the song. It was a chaotic scene as the Penguins skated onto the ice early on in the anthem and took their places on both the blueline and the bench. \nNevertheless, whatever the score, this wasn’t about numbers on a scoreboard. This was about starting over. This was about having a clean slate. At least that was the case for Kessel. \nIf anyone can relate to that, it’s Tyler Seguin. \nFor years, like it or not, Kessel and Seguin were linked by the 2009 trade that saw the Leafs acquire the speedy winger from the Bruins in exchange for a pair of first-round picks and a second rounder. \nIn 2010, the Bruins used one of those selections to pluck Seguin second overall. Three years and one Stanley Cup later, they had grown tired of him. There were stories of his penchant of enjoying the nightlife a little too much. \nFinally, in 2013, they shipped him to the Dallas Stars. He’d worn out his welcome in Boston, just like Kessel eventually did in Toronto. \nThe change of scenery has done wonders for Seguin, who has racked up 161 points in 152 games as a Star. Will a new hockey home do the same for Kessel? Seguin isn’t counting it out. \n“Yeah, to a certain extent, it might,” Seguin said. “Obviously Kessel and I aren’t the same players but any time you get traded, whether it’s Kessel or a Patrick Sharp, well, I don’t know if you want to call it a wakeup call, but you get a little extra fire in you, you get excitement with a whole new scenery. \n“It does take time to adapt. On the other side of it, there’s a little jump in your step because you want to earn the respect of your teammates on the ice and off the ice, the coaches and GMs too, and show that you can play and belong here. I mean, there’s a process to it. \n“I’ll say this: He’s a heck of a hokcey player and I think he’s going to be even better with those guys around him.” \nGuys like Sidney Crosby. \n“I think we’re getting (in sync),” Crosby said. “I think we’ve gotten more used to each other with time here. It will be an adjustment. We’ll talk things out a lot. I think the main thing is that you’re seeing improvement and you feel more comfortable out there. \n“I think we’ll be at the point pretty soon where there shouldn’t be too much that we have to discuss as far as where guys are going to be. We should have that down pretty quickly.” \nA reminder: That was THE Sidney Crosby -- aka Phil Kessel’s new centre -- talking. \nYep, those Leaf years sure seem like a long time ago, don’t they?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:01:40.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
