In a hard-hitting statement, the CPM said: “The relevant provisions of the law should be invoked against Som and he should be arrested immediately.” The MLA had on Sunday visited Bishada to express solidarity with the accused in the case. During his speech he reportedly warned of a befitting reply as had been the case regarding Muzaffarnagar communal riots of 2013, if innocent people were framed in the case. The CPM said Som not only justified Aklab’s murder, but also said all those arrested were “innocent” and demanded their release. — TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:10:21.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
