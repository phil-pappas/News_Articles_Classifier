It had come in January, when he was sentenced for stealing $39 worth of peppered bacon, butter and other items from a Northeast Portland Grocery Outlet.\nMitchell had been facing 2 ½ years in prison then, but the prosecutor and a judge approved a \"last chance\" deal that gave him probation and an order to successfully complete inpatient drug and alcohol treatment through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\nBut in August, Mitchell got booted from an inpatient program in the Medford area, in part, after accusations arose that he stole from another veteran patient. Authorities ultimately decided not to pursue theft charges, but they revoked Mitchell's probation and he was sentenced last week for twice failing urine tests while given passes to leave inpatient treatment.\nLast week, Mitchell told Multnomah County Circuit Judge Eric Bergstrom that he lapsed because he was upset over his brother's ailing health.\nThe judge gave Mitchell the choice of heading straight to prison for 1 ⅓ years or heading to jail for up to six months, with the plan to go directly back into inpatient treatment when a bed opens up. If he fails inpatient treatment again, he'll go to prison for 2 ½ years, the judge said.\nMitchell chose the second option: to give inpatient treatment another chance.\nBergstrom told Mitchell that he needs to learn how to deal with stresses in life without resorting to drugs because \"stresses come up all of the time,\" and \"it could be a different stress tomorrow.\"\nMitchell responded: \"Yes sir, I understand that. But I've got the confidence I can do that.\"\n-- Aimee Green\nagreen@oregonian.com\n503-294-5119\no_aimee", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:05:29.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
