Chris Godwin had four catches for 135 yards and DaeSean Hamilton totaled 96 yards on his five receptions. \nHackenberg became the school career leader in completions (608) and yards passing (7,453), displacing Zach Mills in both categories. \nPenn State (6-2, 3-1 Big Ten) improved to 36-2-1 against the Terps, but Maryland's determined effort before a spirted crowd of 68,948 could help turn this into a regional rivalry. \nLocksley was promoted from offensive coordinator after head coach Randy Edsall was fired on Oct. 11. Although Maryland (2-5, 0-3) led in the fourth quarter and played its best game in a month, the result was all too familiar. \nEdsall was dismissed after a three-game stretch in which the Terrapins were outscored 122-34. Maryland played well in this one but was undone by five turnovers, including three interceptions by Perry Hills. \nHills ran for 128 yards and completed 19 of 28 passes for 225 yards. His final interception came on a deflected pass with 1:15 remaining. \nPenn State went up 31-27 with 13:39 left when Hackenberg tossed a 27-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis. \nMaryland cut the gap with a field goal, and then recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff. But Hills fumbled it back as he was hit while throwing. \nThe Terrapins got the ball following a missed field goal try. Locksley opted to go for it on fourth-and-2 from the Maryland 36, and Hills was intercepted by Trevor Williams with 7:51 to go. \nThat wouldn't be the last turnover for the Terrapins, who wore throwback uniforms patterned after the 1961 team. That was the year in which Maryland earned its lone win over the Nittany Lions at home. \nFor a while, it appeared as if that 44-year drought would end. \nMaryland moved 68 yards on its first possession of the third quarter to take a 20-17 lead. After Hills ran 36 yards to the 10, Brandon Ross scored on third down. \nHackenberg responded by completing a pass to Godwin for 31 yards, then throwing a 20-yarder to Hamilton for a touchdown. Both passes were put up for grabs, and on both occasions the receiver made the play. \nThe back-and-forth duel extended into the next drive, when Hills directed an 88-yard march that ended with a 10-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Lane, making it 27-24. \nThat laid the groundwork for an intense fourth quarter. \nPenn State led 17-13 at halftime despite being limited to 15 yards rushing and converting only once on third down. \nHackenberg went 7 for 16 before intermission, but his completions went for 196 yards — including a 37-yarder to Godwin, who made an outstanding one-handed catch in the end zone while his defender was being called for pass interference. \nMaryland led 13-7 in the second quarter despite committing two turnovers inside the Penn State 20. \nAP college football website: http://collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:52:44.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
