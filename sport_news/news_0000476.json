When you put your starters out there and you have eight underclassmen against an experienced team like Findlay, it’s going to be tough.” \nFindlay advances to the district semifinals Monday with a record of 9-5-3, while the Little Giants end their season at 5-10-1. \nFindlay took the early lead in the eighth minute when Hannah Robertson scored. The score remained 1-0 for more than ten minutes, and then the Trojans exploded. \nMorgan Kirk scored twice in a 33-second span before Lily Anderson scored in the 25th minute. Before the half ended, Taylor Steinke (28th minute), Robertson (31st minute), and Anderson (36th minute) each scored for a 7-0 lead. \n“I thought the girls played well from the beginning of the game,” Findlay coach David LaRocco said. “We got possession of the ball and into dangerous spots and converted on opportunities we had. Once we got the first one, we were able to keep it rolling and add them up quick.” \nThe second half was more domination by Findlay. Jenna Marie Hohman scored in the 47th minute and Alexi Kammeyer added another tally for Findlay just 30 seconds later. Hannah Bloom came into goal for the Little Giants, relieving Hailey Taylor. Bloom allowed just one goal over the final 22 minutes, a score by Steinke in the 65th minute. \n“As the years go by, hopefully we will play better for longer stretches when we’re experienced,” Collison said. “Our seniors had good leadership this year, and we want the younger kids to build off of that. We’re a far cry from what we were three years ago.” Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LN4FOD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:12:01.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
