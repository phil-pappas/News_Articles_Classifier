He has stated that preference before, but never as openly while referencing the current group. \nWhen the Celtics are healthy, that means someone established will be cut out of the lineup every game. Not even listing small-ball options, David Lee, Tyler Zeller, Amir Johnson, Kelly Olynyk and Jared Sullinger all figure to see minutes at the power forward and center positions. \n\"My thought right now is we wouldn't play more than four on most nights,\" Stevens said before Monday's practice. \"So whoever those four might be may depend on the night, it may depend on how they are playing, it may depend on who is healthy. All that other stuff.\" \nIt's still early but Sullinger has been the last veteran big man off the bench in each of three games, including an intrasquad scrimmage when he was not one of the 10 starters. He almost averaged a double-double last season but now has more competition for a role. \nDavid Lee is being relied upon as a playmaker. Tyler Zeller scores efficiently and qualifies as the best returning rim protector. Amir Johnson has long helped his teams in a variety of ways. And Kelly Olynyk's shooting allows the Celtics to mimic the small-ball style that was so successful last season. Then there's Sullinger, a plus rebounder with a strong skill set who's only 23 years old. \nThe fourth-year pro has shown he can make an impact. If he does lose minutes, it will be more a result of team depth than anything else. But the Celtics can't be ecstatic that after a summer of workouts with trainer John Lucas, Sullinger returned without an overhauled physique. If he has improved his conditioning, as he says, it's not by the leaps and bounds he needed.

When he's not overshooting from behind the arc, he's a smart passer with great hands who started 49 of the 58 games he played last season. But the frontcourt has changed. He knows the fight for playing time will be tougher. \n\"At the same time,\" Sullinger said Sunday, \"I'm not here to make it a rivalry between me, Amir, Tyler, Kelly, Jonas or D-Lee. My biggest thing is I just want us to win. If that's me cutting back my minutes, that's me cutting back my minutes, but the ultimate goal is to win basketball (games). That's the ultimate goal as a team, as a unit. Going forward, it's a long season so you never know what's going to happen. You just have to stay ready.\" \nWhat will the rotation look like? That's not clear yet, but we've seen hints of it during the first two games. Stevens has stated a desire to use Lee as a \"point forward\" when Isaiah Thomas isn't on the court. When Thomas steps off the bench, the Celtics will typically pair him with one big man who can shoot and another who works well in the pick-and-roll. \n\"You think about who fits those roles, who is best at those things, who can get better at those things,\" Stevens said. \"But those are things that you have to consider because that makes (Thomas) better. It's really all about how people complement each other and I think that's why you see, really across the league, there are a lot of good basketball players. And sometimes when guys go from team-to-team, it opens up opportunities for them that weren't there at previous teams and you find out how good they are. I think we saw a little bit of that with Jonas last year. He was a great fit for how we played and we had a need for him.\" \nWith Stevens prepared to base his lineups on fit, Sullinger has a few strikes against him. He has never turned his 3-point shot into an efficient option like Olynyk, and falls way behind Zeller (1.2 points per possession) and Johnson (1.16) as a roll man. (Sullinger scored 0.93 points per possession in that category last season.) If Lee stays in the starting lineup, he could use another layer of defensive protection behind him -- a role better suited for Zeller or Johnson. \nAll of the players have their own flaws, which could give Stevens a headache as he tries to dole out minutes every night. It's still early in the preseason and no binding decisions have been made. If Sullinger isn't in the plans already, he is talented enough to force his way back into them. The last time he competed in a game that mattered, he worked over Cleveland for 21 points and 11 rebounds, charging a near Celtics comeback. \nOne way or another, somebody talented will be lacking for minutes in the Celtics frontcourt. \n\"That's the challenge with our team right now,\" Stevens said. \"All the guys that are in that mix have been great. Not only some of the time, but all the time. They've all been really good about it, they all understand it. It is what it is. I think we all realize that we have good players, up and down that group. I've said this before: Some of it is going to be determined on who fits well with other guys to make those other guys better and that's a big part of this.\" \nThe coach added: \"There's going to be competition (in the frontcourt) and the good news is, if somebody's not playing well or if somebody is sick or out or whatever the case may be, we're going to be able to go to our bench and be very, very good. I think that's the great part about having the depth. I think the more that we can have that -- kinda whoever needs to be ready is ready to perform on any given night -- the better we'll be.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:20:53.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
