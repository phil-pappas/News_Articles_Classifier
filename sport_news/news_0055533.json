PHOTO COURTESY OF MICHELLE ESTES Related Stories: \nTwo weeks ago, Lauren Bouvia didnt even know there was a national high school record for goals in a season. \nNow she owns that record. \nThe junior poured in six goals in a 10-0 victory over McCall-Donnelly for the 3A District Three championship this month to give her 111  111!  to break the record of 106 set by Shannon Stiewert of Texas El Paso Coronado High in 1989, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. \nI just didnt believe it, Bouvia said. I didnt think about it after that. I just thought someone out there scored a lot more goals. \nOnce I did achieve it, I was like, Oh, my gosh. Its crazy. \nThe wingers torrid pace has lifted Weiser (17-1-0) back to the 3A state tournament for the first time since 2011, where it opens against Bliss at 2 p.m. Thursday at Vallivue High. \nThe Wolverines finished fourth in the 3A Snake River Valley a year ago. But Bouvia points toward her teammates as the reason for Weisers rise, which includes outscoring opponents 162-16 this season. \nDefenses have assigned one girl to shadow the UC Davis commit since she moved from California to Weiser to begin her freshman year. An improved cast around her allows her to drop the ball off, have a teammate slip a defender and then feed it back to the speedy goal scorer. \nOur team is getting stronger each game, she said. Defenses try to man mark me, but the thing is were such a better team, we can break them down. \nMcCall-Donnelly coach Pim Hoogland and Emmett coach Donald Gregory maintain shes shown her teammates the way. Gregory remarked how she directs the Wolverines on the field. And Hoogland said shes set an example for the rest of her team to follow. \nShe has so much control over the ball its unbelievable, Hoogland said. Shes raising the level of the league. Shes showing what can be done. \nBoth coaches tell their own-jaw dropping stories about Bouvia single-handedly changing games. For Hoogland, his team battled Weiser to a 3-3 draw in September and hit the post on a potential go-ahead goal. Bouvia then collected the ball from a scramble, dribbled 70 yards past, around and through the defense and buried the go-ahead goal. \nThats a two-point swing, Hoogland said. Thats the type of player she is. \nGregory once assigned players to take five-minute shifts defending Bouvia. But his most vivid memory came when he watched one of his defenders block her shot and knock her to the ground. That only angered Bouvia. She popped up, won the ball back, unleashed a spin move and fired a left-footed shot to the far side of the net. \nIt was like, Yeah, you got me once, but I can get you any time I want, Gregory said. Its like playing against someone who holds all the cards. \nThe only defense to succeed in containing Bouvia this season was Skyview, a 4A team that handed Weiser its lone loss at 4-1. But Skyview coach Jason Obert said the FC Nova club star stood out on the field, especially when she made a coast-to-coast run through his defense for the Wolverines only goal. \nThe thing with her is limiting her opportunities, Obert said. If you can limit her opportunities by cutting off her passing lanes and forcing her to have to do things by herself, it controls her a little more. \nIf she has a lot of space to move in, shell eat you alive. \nAny goals Bouvia scores this weekend adds to her national record. But thats not her focus. She said she never set a target, let alone one for a record shed never heard of. \nHer first state tournament remains her only focus. \nI know the competition will be a lot harder, she said. Our team is used to winning 10-0, all these big numbers. We have to realize when we get to state, when we win 3-0, 4-0  if we do win  thats a good win. Michael Lycklama: 377-6424; Twitter: @MichaelLycklama", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:27:33.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
