Saturday is no different, especially against a typically sound program in what should be a hostile environment.\nThe Horned Frogs play away from Fort Worth for the second time in three weeks and have a trip to Iowa State waiting next week, making this a key stretch to play through. TCU is 2-0 on the road this season, having won those contests by a combined nine points. The point differential is significantly different at home.\nKansas State comes off a two-point loss at Oklahoma State, going down on a last-minute field goal. The Wildcats likely can't afford another loss should they hope to compete for a Big 12 crown.\nWhen TCU has the ball\nQuarterback Trevone Boykin was troublesome for the Wildcats during last season's top-10 showdown in Fort Worth, passing for 219 yards and rushing for 123. Boykin totaled four touchdowns with no interceptions. Look for Boykin to have his way with a passing defense that ranks eighth in the conference (288 yards allowed per game).\nTCU rushed for 334 yards in last year's tilt. Whether it can duplicate that against the nation's No. 3 rushing defense will be interesting to watch. The Wildcats are limiting opponents to 71 yards on the ground per game. Running back Aaron Green leads TCU with 100.8 yards per game.\nThe Horned Frogs have offered little hope to opposing teams that they can be stopped offensively, averaging 630 yards per game, and are unlike any team the Wildcats have faced this season.\nWhen Kansas State has the ball\nJoe Hubener is starting at quarterback after passing a series of concussion protocol tests during last week's meeting with Oklahoma State. Hubener had left the game in the first quarter before returning late.\nThe Wildcats lead the Big 12 in time of possession per game, holding the ball for for an average of 32:36. Additionally, Kansas State has proven to be efficient in the red zone, scoring on 91.3 percent of its trips. That number ranks third in the league behind Oklahoma State and Texas Tech.\nExpect Kansas State to do whatever it can to limit possessions for Boykin and the TCU offense. Should it try and open the passing game, it could be met with little success. The Horned Frogs' defensive line, which looked strong against Texas, is expected to get stronger this week.\nGary Patterson says âœgood chanceâ DE Terrell Lathan returns this week. Makes 3 starting D-linemen TCU could have it didnâ™t two weeks ago\n— Jake Trotter (@Jake_Trotter) October 5, 2015 Prediction\nBoykin will go about his usual business, leading the Horned Frogs' air attack through the Wildcats' defense. In the process, TCU will rack up 100-plus yards on the ground, giving Kansas State its toughest test of the season.\nA replenished defensive line will force a mistake or two out of Hubener throughout the game, vaulting TCU to a score indicative of a one-sided affair. Kansas State, because Bill Snyder, will find a way to stay close in the first half.\nUltimately, to no surprise, TCU proves too explosive for Kansas State to keep up with and the Horned Frogs pick up an impressive road win to stay perfect.\nScore: TCU 41, Kansas State 20", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jake_Trotter/status/651070294854115332", "http://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/kansas-state/article38006622.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:07:47.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
