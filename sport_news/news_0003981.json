But for the players involved, Ohio State’s Jalin Marshall said, it’s still special to play in one.\n“It’s the last game of the day for all the college sports games, and you know everybody is watching,” the sophomore receiver said on Wednesday as the No.1 Buckeyes continued preparation for Saturday night’s match against Penn State. “So you’ve got to go out there and perform to the best of your ability and make plays when your number’s called, and, from my side, execute the offense at a high level.”\nWhat makes the biggest difference is the setting — the lights. Marshall, who also returns punts, was asked whether it is tough to pick out the ball when it’s in the air.\n“When the ball gets in the air a little bit, you can kind of get lost” in seeing it, Marshall said. “With the lights in our stadium, it’s so bright that maybe it can get lost in the lights more so than the darkness. So you try to adjust as well as you can in pregame and go out there and make plays.”\nAfter a couple of catches in a victory at Indiana two weeks ago, Marshall had a case of fumble-itis. But he had no such problems last week in a victory over Maryland.\n>> Get the most out of college football season, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \n“I don’t think it was necessarily (being) more careful, it was more fundamentally sound,” Marshall said of the tweaks he made. Like with “the way I carry the ball, put it more on my chest rather than swing it out.”\nLast week, he had four catches for 78 yards, including a 48-yard touchdown that gave OSU a 28-21 lead. He also is 19th in the nation in average yards per punt return (14.1).\nComings and goings With backup safety Erick Smith out with what Meyer said on Wednesday was a knee injury, Meyer indicated that Malik Hooker could move into the secondary rotation. Two weeks ago, it was learned that No.1 nickel back Cam Burrows was lost for the season because of a foot injury.\nMeyer also said Parris Campbell, who started in the season opener at one of the receiver spots, is out for at least the Penn State game because of a knee injury.\nOn the other hand, freshman linebacker Jerome Baker has been elevated to a starter on the kickoff team, Meyer said. Another freshman who could see action is receiver K.J. Hill.\nHill decommits Running back George Hill of Hubbard, Ohio, who has been pledged to OSU’s 2016 recruiting class since June 2014, told Scout.com on Wednesday that he has decommitted. At the same time, it was learned that the Buckeyes will host running back Antonio Williams of New London, N.C., for an official visit this weekend. The Rivals.com four-star prospect had been committed to Wisconsin until earlier this week.\ntmay@dispatch.com \n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:20:31.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
