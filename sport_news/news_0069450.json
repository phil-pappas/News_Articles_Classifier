They had just five turnovers in five games. The Eagles' defense, according to coordinator Bill Davis, sets a goal of three turnovers per game. They got it last night, with three interceptions of Cam Newton -- by Malcom Jenkins, Nolan Carroll and Walter Thurmond. That gives the Eagles 11 on the season. All of last year, they had 12. But the Eagles aren't turning these into wins.\nStreak alive : With those turnovers, the Eagles kept alive their league-leading streak of 13 straight games with a turnover. The last time the Eagles defense did not force a turnover was in last year's 53-20 loss to the Green Bay Packers.\nStreak over : Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart ran for 119 yards, ending the Eagles' streak of 18 straight games without an opposing back rushing for more than 100 yards. That streak dated back to the fourth game of last season, when Frank Gore, then with the 49ers, went over the 100-yard mark.\nTurning the corner : Big free-agent signing cornerback Byron Maxwell took a lot of heat in his first few games with the Eagles. Maxwell has played better in the past few games and played his best game with the Eagles on Sunday night. It's unofficial, but it didn't appear Maxwell allowed a completion all game.\nOn the other side : Cornerback Nolan Carroll, who had been playing well, struggled, despite a heck of a play for his interception.\nBullet dodged : When Eagles left tackle Jason Peters went down in the first quarter, it looked bad. Turns out, it was just back spasms, which are painful but not season ending. Peters should be fine for a game against the Cowboys when the Eagles return from a bye week.\nNo problem : Third-year man Matt Tobin replaced Peters, as he has in the past, and did a good job against former Pro Bowl lineman Jared Allen -- until the final moments. Using all of his 12 years experience, Allen beat Tobin for two sacks on the Eagles' final drive of the game.\nFalling behind : When the Panthers went 72 yards on their first drive for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead, it marked the sixth time in seven games the opposition scored first. The only game this season the Eagles took the early lead was against the Jets.\nBad loss : In the fourth quarter with the Panthers ahead 21-16, the Eagles faced a third-and-nine from the Panthers' 31. Josh Huff caught a Sam Bradford pass behind the line and lost a yard. Caleb Sturgis' 50-yard attempt was just wide left.\nMark Eckel may be reached at mjeck04@verizon.net . @MarkEckel08 .
