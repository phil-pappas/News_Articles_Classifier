The incident drew nationwide condemnation from all major political parties, including the state’s ruling BJP, which is in alliance with Sena. The state government ensured tight security at the venue, Nehru Centre, where “Neither a Hawk nor a Dove: An Insider Account of Pakistan’s Foreign Policy” was later released without any disruption. The attack followed Sena’s failed attempt to prevail upon the management of the Nehru Centre to cancel the book release. Kulkarni told mediapersons that a group of Sena activists accosted him while he was leaving his residence and abused him for organising the book release. They then poured black ink over his head. A defiant Kulkarni, however, said he would not be “cowed” by such actions and go ahead with the evening release. Two hours later, Kulkarni, smeared in black ink, addressed the media alongside Kasuri. Kasuri denounced the attack, saying: “I recognise people’s right to protest, but what has happened with Sudheendra Kulkarni is not protest. Nations are built with a positive mindset, we need a positive mindset.” The chairman of the Ambani-owned Observer Research Foundation said he met Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray ahead of the book release seeking his support but the political leader did not back down. The attack kicked off a storm with BJP patriarch LK Advani, with whom Kulkarni has been closely associated, voicing concern over “growing intolerance” in the country towards any counter viewpoint. “I strongly condemn whosoever has done it.... In the last few days, there are these signs...where any person or any point of view is not acceptable, then you resort to violence or turn intolerant towards them.” “This is a matter of concern for the nation. Democracy must ensure tolerance for a different point of view,” said Advani. Kulkarni has served as speechwriter for BJP veterans Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani. Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju, on the sidelines of Border Security Force event “Swachh Bharat Swachh Himalaya”, said there were ways of protesting in a civilised society. “The Constitution has given the right to everyone to protest in a democratic way. One should only lodge a protest under the law and this will act to strengthen our democracy.” “This is about mentality…In this country, everyone has a fundamental right to protest but there has to be a way to protest, not physically harm anyone. This is not right,” he said. Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said “such intolerance in India can’t be tolerated. First Ghulam Ali concert and now Kasuri's book launch, we don't want a Desi Taliban in India”. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi claimed incidents of “intolerance” had risen over the past 18 months after the BJP came to power. Sena chief’s son Aditya Thackeray, however, said the attack was a sign of non-violence. “Let's not even compare the ink shed on a person who has openly lauded a Maoist sympathiser and endorsed a foreign minister having links with anti-India separatists...,” Aditya, in a message on a social networking site.
