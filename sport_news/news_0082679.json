These guys are all touring professionals, they know what they’re doing. \n“The margins are so small. \n“I had my chances. I just couldn’t make it today. I’ve got to look into it. But at the end of the day this can happen during the year. Unfortunately, here in Shanghai where I was defending champion, I was really hoping again to play a great tournament,” he added. \nRamos-Vinolas, 27, had never beaten a player ranked in the top 10 before. His reward for some fearless hitting was a third-round meeting with Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga who outclassed Victor Estrella Burgos in straight sets. \n“I’m really happy to beat Roger Federer,” Ramos-Vinolas told the ATP’s website (www.atpworldtour.com). \n“I didn’t expect it during the match. After the second set I thought I would lose. But I played really good. I am very happy because it’s the most important victory for me.” \nNinth seed Milos Raonic, one of several players hovering around the cut-off mark for the year-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London, reached the second round when he came through against Brazil’s Thomaz Bellucci in two tiebreaks. \nSouth Africa’s Kevin Anderson, seeded 12, beat German veteran Tommy Haas in straight sets. \nTop seed Novak Djokovic, fresh from winning a sixth Beijing title, begins on Wednesday against Slovakia’s Martin Klizan. \nAndy Murray, seeded three despite moving above Federer in the rankings, plays American Steve Johnson on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:21:53.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
