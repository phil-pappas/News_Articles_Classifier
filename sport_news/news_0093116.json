(Mostly because we're all in denial.)\nShowrunner Scott M. Gimple, no doubt predicting the online meltdown that was sure to ensue, sent a statement for Chris Hardwick to read on \"The Talking Dead\" following the controversial episode, which may or may not reassure fans about Glenn's fate.\n\"Dear fans of 'The Walking Dead,' this is a hard story to tell and when we were planning to tell it, we knew our friends at the 'Talking Dead would be talking to you about it. And knowing you'd all be talking and feeling and commiserating, I knew we should say something about it, lest our silence say something we didn't mean to say or not say. So I'll say this: In some way, we will see Glenn, some version of Glenn, or parts of Glenn again, either in flashback or in the current story, to help complete the story.\"\nYeun has always had a fairly levelheaded outlook on his character's fate -- perhaps because Glenn has always been on borrowed time, as far as comic book fans are concerned. Before season five began, Yeun was Quote: d by Vanity Fair as saying, \"I don't particularly want to subscribe to the idea that this show can kill off anybody it wants. Yes, it can. Yes, that's a thing. That's definitely a thing. But I think that's not the point of the show. 'Game of Thrones' kills people left and right and yet that's not the point of the show... We talk in terms of 'are you afraid to get killed off?' And for me, if it serves the story, I'm game for anything. I hope people can watch the show in that same regard. Stop watching it to see if your favorite character is still alive. That's kind of been on my mind lately because you notice a lot of fans saying 'we want you to live, or we want this person to die' and it's like, that's not what the show's about.\"\n'The Walking Dead' recap: Zombies take their toll in shocking development Alan Eyerly Proving that no one is safe in a zombie apocalypse — except macho Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), presumably — a series regular since Season 1 meets his gruesome demise on AMC’s “The Walking Dead.”\n“Thank You” (Episode 603) marks the end of a long and bloody journey for Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun),...\nProving that no one is safe in a zombie apocalypse — except macho Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), presumably — a series regular since Season 1 meets his gruesome demise on AMC’s “The Walking Dead.”\n“Thank You” (Episode 603) marks the end of a long and bloody journey for Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun),...\n(Alan Eyerly) ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e3992/turbine/ct-the-walking-dead-death-20151026", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562ce7d0/turbine/la-et-st-the-walking-dead-recap-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:31:00.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
