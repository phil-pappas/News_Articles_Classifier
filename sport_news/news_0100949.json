Six points, we are top of the group.” \nHe then reacted tetchily to questions about why he has largely refused to talk to the media in recent months and quashed suggestions he might leave Real in the short term, possibly to return to former club Manchester United. \n“My future is at Madrid,” the 30-year-old said. \n“I want to win things here and I feel good,” he added. “But as I have said a million times nobody knows the future. We will see what happens.” \nReal was knocked off top spot in La Liga after it was held to a 0-0 draw at home to Malaga last weekend and is third on 14 points, level with Celta Vigo and two ahead of Atletico. Atletico incidentally surrendered the lead and was beaten 1-2 at home to Benfica in Champions League Group C on Wednesday. \nVillarreal, which plays at Levante on Sunday, is the surprise leader on 16 points, one ahead of second-placed champion Barcelona, which plays at Europa League holder Sevilla tomorrow. \nSevilla also ended up on the losing side on Wednesday, falling 0-2 at Juventus in their Champions League Group D clash. \n“It’s going to be tough,” Ronaldo said of the game at the Calderon, where Real was thumped 0-4 in La Liga last term. \n“Atletico play very well and are full of confidence,” he added. “We are also in good shape and important players are coming back (from injury).” \nReal coach Rafael Benitez is waiting on the fitness of several key men, including Wales winger Gareth Bale, Colombia playmaker James Rodriguez and Spain center back Sergio Ramos. \nOn Wednesday, well-shackled most of the time by the dogged Malmo defense, Ronaldo only sporadically lit up the Swedish night with his brilliance — netted his 81st and 82nd Champions League goals. Thankfully for Real it was enough to secure all three points and take it to the top of Group A. \n“It says something about how good he is,” said Malmo defender Anton Tinnerholm, who had most of the responsibility for marking Ronaldo. \n“Even when he has a bad day, he can still decide games.” \nBenitez did not want to be drawn into the debate about who is the greatest goalscorer in Real’s history, but Ronaldo’s speed in catching Raul’s mark leaves little doubt. \n“That’s a question for others to answer, but I’m very happy that the team won, that we kept a clean sheet, that we took three points, that Ronaldo scored two goals and (equalled) a record,” the Spaniard told a news conference. “We have seen many great goalscorers in history but he managed to do it in less games.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:39:42.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
