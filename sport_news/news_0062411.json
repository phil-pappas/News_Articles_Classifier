If the Yankees don’t put Davis on their 40-man roster, Davis would be eligible for the Rule 5 draft, which means any major league club could select him and he would no longer be a Yankee. Davis, 22, who ended the season with the Yankees Class AA affiliate in Trenton, N.J., says he’s not losing any sleep over his future. “It’s a business, and I understand that,” Davis said in an interview Tuesday after addressing the Jacksonville Rotary Club at the Jacksonville Country Club. “Whatever they have to do for their big league club to win a World Series and compete. I definitely want to be a part of that; absolutely, there’s no question about that. “But right now it’s too early, and even whenever the time comes I don’t think I’ll be nervous. I feel like I had a good year this year and I feel I’ve progressed in a way that I’m proud of. So whether I suit up for the Yankees in September next year or the Giants or whoever it is, I just want to help them win.” All indications are the Yankees will opt to “protect” Davis from the Rule 5 draft, especially since he was listed as the organization’s No. 1 minor league pitching prospect by Yankeesondemand.com after going 8-7 with 129 strikeouts and 26 walks in 130 2/3 innings while sporting a 3.86 ERA with Tampa and Trenton. “Obviously, I want to be a Yankee for the next 20 years and win 20 World Series. So I’m hopeful. I think it looks pretty good, but we’ll wait it out,” Davis said. “You never can tell. There’s got to be some pieces moved and some hard choices to make. That’s why they’re in the front office and I throw a ball for a living. But I think I put myself in a fairly good position. So we’ll wait it out.” Davis joked with the Rotarians that he relied on his father, Billy, “to let me know how it works.” “If I get a call, I get a call,” the younger Davis said. For the most part, Davis told the Rotary Club about his journey through the minor leagues, starting with being drafted in the 14th round in 2011 by the Yankees. Page 2 of 3 - “Draft day, I don’t know who lost more hair, me or my mom,” he said. “It was up and down, didn’t know where I was going to go. I had a fairly decent idea. Fell down the draft board a little bit, farther than we anticipated.” He also said the minor leagues aren’t nearly as glamorous as some might believe, especially pitching in the Gulf Coast League in 2012. “It’s literally exactly like high school, chain link fence, no fans,” he said. “I came home for the off season and I’m thinking, Wow, this isn’t really what I was expecting.” In 2013 he moved up to Staten Island, which he said was “awesome,” especially since it was just a “ferry ride” from New York City. Then in 2014 he was “pegged as the breakout prospect for 2014,” and he learned a valuable lesson that season. He said he spent too much time focused on one question: When was he going to get prompted? “And that mindset just snowballed over the course of the season,” he said. “It was the worst season I had ever had as a baseball player, no matter what age it was. It took me until the last start of the year to get my ERA under 5.00. To those of you that (don’t) know very much about baseball, a 5.00 era is not going to get you anywhere.” But his mother, Lisa, told him that season is what would ultimately make him a major leaguer. He’d always thought he was tough mentally –“stubborn at some points,” he added – but he discovered he had a ways to go. So he began working with a “mental conditioning coach” to help him make strides that were “just night and day” from 2012 to 2013. He was an all-star for Tampa, but because he had pitched two days before the all-star game and couldn’t take part in it he was left off the roster in lieu of a player who could play. That, Davis said, was fine. He knew he’d made it – and not just as an all-star. Just how far he’d come was evident in how he approached his starts this past season. There was a time, he said, he would “dread” his starts, wondering when the other team would break out for a big inning. “I’m through four innings, no runs, and (he’s wondering), When’s that big inning going to happen?” he said. This past year the first batter he faced in Tampa smacked a triple down the line. After the inning, his pitching coach and catcher came over to him in the dugout concerned about his frame of mind, telling him everything was fine. Davis replied in kind. Page 3 of 3 - “Not once did I think, ‘Oh, God, here we go,’” he recalled. “It was, ‘That wasn’t a good pitch.’” After his speech, Davis fielded a number of questions. – What was the hardest pitch he’s had to learn? The changeup, he said, “especially for a power pitcher.” – Had he ever been hurt? No, although he lost 30 pounds in two weeks – from 270 as a result of “a lot of late-night ice cream”– because of a virus in 2012. – What’s his go-to pitch? Fastball, “no doubt,” he said. And how fast does he throw it? This year, he said, he averaged 92 to 96 mph, with a high of 98. “Trying to get to 100,” he added. “I always told my dad if I hit 100 I’m hanging ‘em up, just walk right off, go out on top.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:34:31.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
