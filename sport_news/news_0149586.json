He tied for second with Jordan Spieth in the 2010 Junior Players Championship at the Stadium Course, a tournament that also included Daniel Berger, Justin Thomas, Patrick Rodgers and Oliver Schneiderjans. \n“We used to play a lot together and hang out together,” Grillo said of their days in major junior championships and the American Junior Golf Association. “Now I can see them winning majors and winning tournaments. It gives me the motivation and knowledge that I can win out here.” \nGrillo said the core group of friends would play putting and chipping games “for five or 10 bucks.” \n“We were all close,” he said. \nThat 2010 Junior Players had perhaps the strongest field in the nine-year history of the tournament. It looked at one point like Grillo and Spieth were going to go to the 17th hole to start a playoff but Michael Johnson, who is a senior at Auburn and an All-SEC golfer, made a 20-foot bogey putt at the last to win by one shot. \n“Great times,” Grillo said. \nAmong that group’s accomplishments so far: Spieth won the Masters, U.S. Open, the Tour Championship, the FedEx Cup and the Tour scoring title, and was named PGA Tour player of the year on Friday. Berger was named rookie of the year. Thomas finished 32nd on the FedEx Cup points list and Rodgers has earned his PGA Tour card for next season off the Web.com Tour regular-season money list. Grillo had his card locked up before this week. \nLong, arduous path for Stegmaier \nFew players have taken such a winding road to the PGA Tour as Brett Stegmaier, a former University of Florida player who locked up his PGA Tour card before getting into contention in the Web.com Tour Championship. \nStegmaier, a two-time All-American and All-SEC player, turned pro in 2006. He developed ligament problems in his left wrist, tried to play through the pain, and had surgery in 2008. He played ineffectively in 2009, left the professional game and worked in a prop shop. He had another surgery, then began working to get back on the Web.com Tour two years ago. \nHe said the reason for giving life as a touring pro another try was simple. \n“I didn’t want to have a real job, to be totally honest,” he said. “I enjoy playing. I like the fact that I can play golf and make money and not be stuck inside a pro shop answering phones. It took a lot to get out here but obviously it was worth it.” \nStegemaier, who shot 66 to tie for fifth at 7-under-par 133, was eighth in Finals money entering the week. But he wants more -- like winning the Finals money title. \n“It comes with a lot of extras,” he said, referring to a full exemption onto the PGA Tour and a spot in The Players Championship next May. “And I have a lot of work ahead of me. I can’t relax just because I got my Tour card. There’s still a lot to play for. A lot of guys get it [their cards] and fall back here.” \nvan der Walt still with a chance \nDawie van der Walt is the only player who can catch Patton Kizzire for the overall Web.com Tour money title. He took the first step by making the cut and ending the first two rounds in a tie for 45th at 1-under 139. \nHowever, Kizzire shot 67 and is tied for 28th at 3-under. With $532,740 in earnings, he has a lead of $167,131 over van der Walt. The first-place checks is $180,000, which means the only way van der Walt can win the money title is to win the tournament (he’s nine shots back) and hope that Kizzire finishes out of the top-20. \nTough little hole \nThe par-3 11th hole has played the most difficult on the Valley Course in the first two rounds. The 229-yard hole, with water on the front-right and tricky mounds to the left, is averaging 3.388. There were only four birdies in the second round. \nIt wasn’t too hard for Smylie Kaufman. He made a hole-in-one there on Thursday and in addition to whatever bar tab he may have covered for his fellow players later that night, he also sent a cooler of beer to the media center for reporters on Friday. \nThey were wishing for better things for the former LSU players. Kaufman shot 70 in the second round and missed the cut by one shot after making a double-bogey at the par-5 16th hole. He parred No. 11 in the next go-around. \n8 is enough \nThe second-hardest hole on the course this week has been the par-4 eighth, which is one of the two holes converted from being par-5s (No. 17 is the other). \nNo. 8 measures 502 yards and the trouble for the field has been hitting the green. Less than 30 percent of the players (.290) have found the putting surface. \nOne who did was Lucas Glover, who drained a 35-foot for one of only 11 birdies on the day. \nHarsh finish \nBud Cauley of Jacksonville missed the cut by one shot when he double-bogeyed the 18th hole. ... Among the other players missing the even-par cut were past PGA Tour winners Jonathan Byrd of St. Simons Island, Ga., Johnattan Vegas, Eric Axley, Tim Petrovic and Dicky Pride. ... Vegas cost himself his PGA Tour card with the missed cut. He was the bubble boy on the Finals money list at No. 25. ... Tommy Gainey was bucking for a spot in the final group when he was 5-under for the day and two shots behind Grillo with three holes to play. But he went into the water at No. 7, his 16th hole, and made triple, and followed that with a bogey at No. 8. His 69 left him tied for 17th at 4-under. \nGarry Smits: (904) 359-4362", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:49:22.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
