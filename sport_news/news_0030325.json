Person and Durant worked on the side in Monday's practice after missing Thursday night's 31-21 loss at New Orleans. \nCoach Dan Quinn says he hopes Person and Durant can practice on Wednesday. \nJones has played in every game despite missing some practices the last four weeks with toe and hamstring injuries. The star receiver missed last week's first practice. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:11:56.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
