Quarterbacks coach Danny Barrett has been named interim coach.\nThe decision ends a tumultuous season marked by a rash of injuries and dismal on-field play that was punctuated by UCF being ranked last in Football Bowl Subdivision in total offense.\nO'Leary agreed to a contract extension in 2014 on the heels of a program-best 12-win season and Fiesta Bowl victory.\nThe 69-year-old coach leaves UCF with an 81-68 record. He went 0-11 in his first season at UCF in 2004, but took the Knights to their first-ever bowl appearance in 2005. It was the first of seven bowl berths the under O'Leary.
