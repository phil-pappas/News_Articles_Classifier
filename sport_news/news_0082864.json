Just before the extra sessions, Logan tied the game with a long touchdown pass to force overtime. After Logan scored, Box Elder answered with a 2-yard TD run from Darius Macfarland. An extra point would send the game to a third overtime, but the Bees mishandled the snap and gave the Grizzlies the season-opening victory. \nIn Week 2, Brighton took an eight-point lead in the fourth quarter when Kimball Reece scooped up a fumble and ran it back for a touchdown. Fremont still had a chance, driving down the field and scoring on a Hayes Hadley TD catch. \nThe Silver Wolves could tie the game with a two-point conversion in the final minute, but the Brighton defense rose to the challenge. The Bengals avoided the upset. \nIn Week 7, there was a lot at stake between Murray and Kearns. The Cougars were coming off a disappointing loss the week prior to Olympus, and trail 18-14 to the Spartans — staring at defeat again. \nBut with less than two minutes left, a short pass to Shay Reid turned into a big gain for Kearns — a 96-yard game-winning touchdown to give Kearns the 21-18 win. \nIn another game with playoff implications, Hunter hosted Viewmont in Week 8. With 30 seconds left, Hunter quarterback Mckay Miedlinger decided to go big or go home. His deep pass was caught by Olsen Williams, who outran the Vikings for a game-winning touchdown in a 30-23 victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:12:07.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
