You’re a Chicago Cubs fan and your team is sitting in 3rd place in the National League Central division behind two of the best teams in baseball, the St.Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates on July 26th, 2015. \nThe Cubs finish the season 97-65 (46-19 after July 26th), in 3rd place in the NL Central while still holding the 3rd best overall record in baseball. They take out the Pirates in a one game playoff to advance to the National League Divisional Series against the St.Louis Cardinals, who just so happen to own the best record in baseball. But with an amazing roster of young talented future stars, the Cubs defeat the Cardinals and move onto the NLCS. They did it with 7 players under 25 years of age (three of them under 22). \nThe Cubs were not the only MLB team in the post-season this year to unleash the future of baseball. The Astros, Mets, Rangers, Pirates, and even the Cardinals gave us all hope for the future of the sport. \nIf you were worried about baseball now that Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera retired, don’t be. This youth movement is bringing a whole new fan base to the sport along with fans in the stands. They are making the game fun again. \nLet’s take a journey back over the past 100 years to put together the best MLB Post-Season Lineup with the only stipulation being that every player must be under 24 years of age the year they were in the playoffs. \n(Statistics Updated as of 10/19) C – Kyle Schwarber, Cubs (2015) \nThe 2015 playoffs are still going as we speak, however, Kyle Schwarber is doing something no one expected he would be doing at 22 years old. He is taking advantage of each and every at bat of the postseason and has put up some insane numbers based on age, experience, and how many playoff games he has played in his career.
