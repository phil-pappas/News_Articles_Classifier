He knows he will be without Victor Cruz once again. He knows Jayron Hosley is starting in place of Prince Amukamara. He knows his pass defense is a work in progress.\nCoughlin knows Chip Kelly’s Eagles had found their mojo against the Saints. He knows Eagles fans have it in for the Giants, and spew venom and hatred at them for having the gall to win four Super Bowls since 1987, or four more than their Eagles have won — ever. He knows DeMarco Murray finally began looking like DeMarco Murray against the Saints. He knows the Giants’ running game has been mostly stuck in quicksand.\nHere’s what else Coughlin knows: He has the good fortune to own an $84 million quarterback who is paid to get the Giants out of fixes like this. Who gave the franchise the bang for its bucks when it counted against the 49ers at the end, and is being asked to do it again now.\nSuch is the mandate of the $84 million quarterback: sometimes, when all might be crumbling around you, rise above the rubble and rally the players around you. You see order when others see chaos. For much of the last eight seasons, at least until Tony Romo began to make his move, Coughlin has had the best quarterback in the division. He will have the best quarterback in the building Monday night, for what it’s worth. And it’s worth plenty.\nManning, 34 now, began allaying fears a year ago that perhaps he was no longer an ascending quarterback. He has made everyone forget his clock management forgetfulness against the Cowboys on opening night and fourth-quarter foibles against the Falcons. He is getting the ball out quickly behind a tenacious young offensive line that takes sacks personally.\n“It’s a high-efficiency, quick, ball-out-of-the-quarterback’s-hand offense,” Eagles defensive coordinator Billy Davis said. “If there is any pressure, he throws it away. He’s not taking the sack and he’s not throwing the interception. He would rather take the intentional grounding and just eat the incomplete and play another down, and I think that’s why their offense is pretty efficient.”\nHis 66.5 completion percentage is the best of his career. His 10:2 touchdown:interception ratio would be, too. His comfort with his young offensive coordinator and in the pocket has been comforting for Coughlin.\n“You see it at times on film where he looks very comfortable and his feet look outstanding — that doesn’t happen overnight nor does it happen in two years,” offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo said. “But he’s working, he’s getting better at it, and he still has room to grow there.”\nKelly rolled the dice on Sam Bradford, who has been the anti-Eli:\n2014: Bradford reinjured his ACL in Week 3 of the preseason and was done for the season\n2013: Bradford tore his left ACL in Week 7 against the Panthers and was put on IR prior to reconstructive surgery\n2011: Bradford suffered a high left ankle sprain on his left ankle. He missed the next five games.\nManning? He’s started every game since the 10th game of his rookie season in 2004.\n“It’s helped us immensely to be able to have that position solidified and have an outstanding player, great leader at that spot over the years to be able to count on that knowing full well that that was going to be done as well as we could do it,” Coughlin said. “Then we would have to deal with all the changes that have happened over the course of time around that position, but because Eli has been there as an anchor and a guy who we can always turn to, it’s been a spot that many times we’ve had to build a football team around. So thank goodness for that.”\nManning engineered his 27th fourth-quarter comeback victory against the 49ers. There is every chance Coughlin will turn to him Monday night and ask for a 28th.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under ben mcadoo ,  chip kelly ,  eli manning ,  new york giants ,  philadelphia eagles ,  sam bradford ,  tom coughlin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:15:57.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
