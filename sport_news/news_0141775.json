About to go ice up and then get ready for Sunday.\" \nOf course, Peters was able to play last Sunday in the team's 23-20 loss to the Washington Redskins, but had to leave the game due to the injury. Peters said that despite the injury, he won't be changing anything he does before the game, and isn't worried about it acting back up. \n\"No, I'm not worried,\" Peters said before abruptly ending his session with reporters. \"Because I am who I am.\" \nPeters playing is a major boost to an Eagles' offensive line that struggled mightily against the Redskins. In addition to Peters, the team's other starting offensive tackle Lane Johnson has also been dealing with an injury, but he as well as confirmed he will play against the Saints. EAGLES: Sam Bradford report card \nWith both Peters and Johnson on the field, the Eagles will have four of their five starting offensive linemen from Week 1. Assuming they are able to stay healthy, Peters is confident the group will be able to better protect quarterback Sam Bradford. \n\"We are not far,\" Peters said. \"We have to start getting our chemistry together and get everything tightened up. Right now we are in a slump, but we aren't far off from where we used to be.\" \nThe offensive line turning it around would be a very positive development for the Eagles, as the unit's poor play is a major reason the team has dropped to 1-3 on the season . \nPeters remained optimistic despite the poor start to the season. \n\"We have to win one game at a time,\" Peters said. \"Take care of the Saints, and go one game at a time, and get everything rolling.\" THE NO-HUDDLE SHOW, Ep. 10: Can Chip Kelly fix the mess he's created with Eagles? \nWe know Chip Kelly is a good coach, but after the Eagles' disastrous start to the season, we're starting to see he might not be a very good general manager.
