Seattle and Sporting Kansas City have 48.\nRobbie Keane opened the scoring in the 36th minute for the Galaxy. Fanendo Adi (65th and 68th) gave the Timbers the lead, 2-1. Diego Chara followed with a free header in the 74th minute.\nThe Galaxy thought it had some life in the 84th minute when Keane scored again, cutting the lead to 3-2, but approximately 20 seconds from kickoff, Portland’s Darlington Nagbe beat his defender and Galaxy goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts for a 4-2 lead.\n“To a man, it wasn’t good enough,” Galaxy midfielder Steven Gerrard said. “We have to take responsibility for that second-half performance.”\nThe last time the Galaxy allowed five goals at home was in 2009, in a 6-3 loss to FC Dallas.\nNow, it has to find a way to get the necessary result on the road. The club has just two victories on the road this season.\n“This was obviously a disappointment in the last home game of the season,” Keane said. “It was embarrassing, the manner we conceded the goals.\n“This stage of the season, we can’t feel sorry for ourselves, it is disappointing now, but it is important to move on quickly as possible. We can’t dwell too much on this.”\nContact the writer: dcalhoun@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:14:25.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
