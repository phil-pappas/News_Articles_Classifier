Comer , while earning AL.com Player of the Week honors in Birmingham. He rushed for 166 yards and a touchdown, threw two TD passes and had two fumble recoveries. \n\"Ahmad just has a strong will to win,\" said his coach, Rod Isaac. \"Whatever it takes, he's willing to do - running, catching, throwing, blocking. He was just having fun (last week) competing and getting all his teammates involved. He is such an unselfish competitor. It's always special to see teammates play for each other.\" \nAhmad Isaac's Week 9 effort led to one of the biggest voting frenzies of the season , Isaac finished with 18,005 votes, compiled online from AL.com readers, to outdistance Thompson quarterback Walker Lott and his 338 all-purpose effort in a win against Tuscaloosa County . Lott compiled 10,616 votes. \nGrayson Cash , Hewitt-Trussville’s dynamic, two-way letterman, filled in for injured running back Jarrion Street in an effort which earned him third place with 3,927 votes. \nNot that it’s always this season for Isaac, listed at six feet, 160 lbs. \n“Usually close to the fourth quarter is when we normally get winded, but we have to fight through it,” he said. \nOn Friday, Midfield (5-3, 4-1) plays Fultondale (4-4, 3-2) in Class 3A, Region 3 action. \nWeek 9 Birmingham Player of the Week \nTotal votes: 34,246", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:48:56.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
