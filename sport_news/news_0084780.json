She was forced to withdraw from tournaments in Tokyo and Wuhan, China as well. \n\n“I thought I was physically ready, but unfortunately, the symptoms of my concussion came back,” Bouchard said after the Wuhan withdrawal. “I hope to get well soon and look forward to returning next year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:14:15.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
