they bowled very consistently and got the ball to 'reverse' at speed, and we weren't able to handle that. \n\"The leg-spinner bowled with some good control, but if we are being brutally honest there were a few shots in our dismissals which we would probably want to rethink.\" \nRoot cited minor mitigation in conditions which put a premium on sound defence and sensible attacking options to help batsmen get set. \n\"It's not a very easy place to start your innings - and when you are put under pressure, as we were, you can get found out if you aren't right on the ball from the start. \n\"It's something we've got to learn from and learn fast, going into the second innings. \n\"We just weren't good enough today, simple as that. \n\"We know we are a very good side, have a lot of talent in the dressing room, and it's just about making sure we don't make the same mistakes again in the second innings.\" \nHis was always likely to be a very important wicket - and after adding only 12 to his overnight score, the vice-captain did not absolve himself from blame. \n\"With 80-odd, set fair from last night, I felt as if I should be the one to go on and make a big score, make big partnership with Jonny (Bairstow) - and we'd be need near their score. \n\"So that was very disappointing.\" \nAmong others found wanting was out-of-form wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler, who edged Wahab behind for a duck. \nRoot said: \"He'll be disappointed after today. \n\"But he's a fine player, and I expect him to bounce back because that's what great players do. \n\"Jos has had a couple of low scores. \n\"But I've got every confidence in him turning it around, and I can see him doing great things for England in the future.\" \nWahab agreed Root's wicket was key. \n\"Obviously, Root is a very good player and a very aggressive player,\" he said. \n\"So we know he's a very important person to get out. We thought if we did that, we could dry up the runs and put pressure on the new batsmen - which happened.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:24:37.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
