On Rolovich’s teams, about 60 percent of the roster was Polynesian thanks to its location. But the opposition usually didn’t have any Polys. That’s not the case anymore. \n“You’re seeing long hair cover up a lot of vowels on a lot of jerseys at this stage in college football,” said Rolovich, a reference to the often hard-to-pronounce Polynesian surnames. “I think the secret is out.” \nTeams all around the country are adding Polynesian players to their roster, including Utah, the No. 3-ranked team in the nation whose “Polynesian players provide the backbone of Utes’ Pac-12 surge,” according to a recent ESPN story. Nevada has gotten in on the act, too, and has 10 players of Polynesian descent, including eight who have joined the team since coach Brian Polian took over in January 2013. Murray's MW rankings: A new No. 1 for first time in 2015 \nPolian first got experience with Polynesian players when he recruited Manti Te’o to Notre Dame when he was an assistant there. The Te’o family holds great influence in the Polynesian community and Rolovich, a Bay Area native, has had a great relationship with Polynesians thanks to his time at Hawaii. \n“Nick Rolovich is like an honorary Polynesian because of his time at the University of Hawaii,” Polian said. “Sometimes I think he thinks he’s Polynesian. With his connections throughout the Polynesian football community and my experience with Manti mattered to people because Manti’s parents and uncle are pretty influential, so it’s enabled us to continue to recruit players from that community.” \nTwo of Nevada’s better defensive players, linemen Ian Seau and Salesa Faraimo, are Polynesian, as are some potential stars, Hausia Sekona and Gabe Sewell, who were in the Wolf Pack’s most recent class. They’re both redshirting this season but are highly regarded and could play big roles next season. \nOffensive lineman Joey Anglemire, linebackers Faigofie Faaituala and Jake Lacaden and defensive linemen Marc Ma, Adam Sagapolu and Kalei Meyer also are Polynesian. While careful not to stereotype, the Wolf Pack coaches said the team’s Polynesian players are tough and low maintenance. \n“I don’t know a lot about the Polynesian culture in general, but I know with the guys we have it’s very important to them,” defensive coordinator Scott Boone said. “They take a lot of pride in playing football and they have a lot toughness. Whether you’re Polynesian, white or black, if you don’t have toughness you’re going to have a hard time playing on defense. Those guys have toughness and you can coach them hard and get after them and challenge them and they seem to be stimulated by that sort of thing.” \nRolovich said Polynesians are family oriented, which lends itself to football. \n“It goes back to their cultural values and how they fit into teamwork,” Rolovich said. “Most of the Polynesians come from big families and most of them understand sacrifice and understand respect of your elders and respect the rules of the house. I think that translates great to a team environment. They’re tough for the most part. They’re generally good people. They like to laugh. They’re not into making trouble. They like to play football. They’re competitive. In the last 15 years, it’s really exploded.” Polian: 'There was no leadership' in loss to Wyoming \nFaraimo and Faaituala were both born in California but their parents were born in American Samoa. Faraimo, who has travelled back to Samoa on occasion, said football is viewed as a way out and an opportunity for a college education. He said football and rugby are the country’s two big sports. \n“It’s definitely big in the Polynesian community,” Faraimo said of football. “It gives us an opportunity to go to college and maybe further than that. Polynesians tend to be a lot bigger and very physical, so it fits us.” \nFaaituala, a senior and one of the most tenured players on the team, said he’s enjoyed having more Polynesians join the team, especially since the No. 1 priority for Polynesians is family. \n“It’s fun to be around people who come from the same culture as you, other Polys,” Faaituala said. “In our culture, family is a big thing. When there are a lot of Polys around, you get a good feeling. Coming from a small island, we had to lean on each other to survive. There’s not a lot of resources like we have out here. Out there, to get by, you have to rely on each other kind of like in football.” \nPerhaps the only thing valued about football in Polynesian culture is family and faith. Seau’s uncle, Junior, was one of the first Polynesians to have a successful NFL career. But Ian Seau said it doesn’t matter how well you do in football if you don’t put family first. That’s always the most important thing. \n“The only way to get respect as a Polynesian is to respect your family,” Seau said. “If you’re good in football, you’re good, but if you’re a star in football and disrespect your family or your last name, you’re basically disrespecting everything that you stand for. Family is the No. 1 thing. It goes faith, family and then football. Football is for sure in the top five. But family and faith are for sure the top spots.” \nPolian said Nevada will continue to recruit Polynesians, with much of that recruiting done in Hawaii and Utah by Rolovich. Polian said the fact Nevada has double-digit Polynesian players on its team helps. \n“In my experience, a lot of recruiting in the Polynesian community is relationship based,” Polian said. “If you have one player show up and have a good experience and trust you, they will share that with other families. Once you have a couple of guys who say they’ve been treated well, you’re likely to get more.” Get to know Wolf Pack foe: Hawaii \nAnd the number of Polynesians on college and NFL rosters continues to increase. Faaituala said he grew up watching Seau, Troy Polamalu and Lofa Tatupu, three successful NFL players, but it’s hard to keep track of all of the Polynesians in the pros these days. There are just too many, which is a good thing. \n“For us to look at that and see Polynesians in the league and growing, it’s an inspiration to other Polynesians around here and back home in Samoa,” Faaituala said. “It gives us hope that we can make it, that we have a chance and we have a place in football. That’s a big thing for us.” \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
