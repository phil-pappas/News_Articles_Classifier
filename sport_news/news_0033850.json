Buy Photo 4 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nYou’ve heard the adage about a dedicated athlete being the last one to leave. For three years, that was Kadeem Jack. \nHours after Rutgers men’s basketball games, when the only folks at the RAC were custodians and straggling reporters as the clock approached midnight, Jack worked on his shot, his post moves, his conditioning. \nIt paid off Wednesday, when the big man signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers. \n“It’s very, very exciting,” Jack said via phone Wednesday night, “but I think the biggest thing is staying humble and keeping my head down and continuing to work.” Newcomers in spotlight as Rutgers hoops practice opens \nOver the next three weeks, Jack will have a chance to make the Pacers’ final roster. If not, the franchise could assign him to the D-League, where he will be a phone call away from NBA duty. \n“I’m just happy to get the opportunity, honestly,” Jack said. “Not many people get that opportunity, and I’m definitely conscious of that. I don’t want to take it for granted.” Buy Photo \nKadeem Jack (Photo: File photo) \nThe power forward averaged 13.0 points and 6.4 rebounds per game last winter, but never quite found a groove after an early-season hand injury. At 6-foot-9, with a strong face-up game and NBA-level athleticism, Jack was viewed as a potential second-round draft pick after a strong junior season. Off the court, the Queens native was a three-time conference All-Academic honoree. \nNot counting players who transferred out, Jack will seek to become the 11th Rutgers player to compete in the NBA or ABA, joining James Bailey (1980-88), John Battle (1986-95), Hollis Copeland (1980-82), Quincy Douby (2007-09), Bob Greacen (1970-72), Roy Hinson (1984-91), Eddie Jordan (1978-84), Bob Lloyd (1968-69), Hamady Ndiaye (2011-14) and Phil Sellers (1976-77). Q&A with Rutgers basketball coach Eddie Jordan \nGetting to this point was difficult. He persevered through bad breaks, including a broken foot and a tumultuous coaching change, and credited the man who recruited him to Rutgers for toughening him up. \n“Mike Rice helped me understand how to fight through adversity,” Jack said of the former Scarlet Knights’ coach. “Since I got on campus he kept harping on being comfortable in chaos. That definitely stuck with me, even with things that don’t have to do with basketball.” \nRice, who works as a director at the Neptune-based Hoop Group now, tweeted his well-wishes late Wednesday night. \n“Congrats to Kadeem Jack, signing with the Indiana Pacers,” Rice wrote. “All of those nights grinding on your game has paid off.” \nStaff writer Jerry Carino: jcarino@gannettnj.com . 4 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RvpQpc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:48:48.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
