Mizerock had coached third base since Mackanin replaced Ryne Sandberg, who resigned on June 26. It is possible that Samuel, if he opts to return, could move across the diamond to coach third, a post he has manned in the past. \n\"We feel like we need a change and we're going to look at the mix of the coaches and zero in on whoever we feel we can help [the team],\" Mackanin said. \"We're going to look at the pool of available people. We have some thoughts in mind, but during the course of the next week or two we'll be making a decision on the rest of the coaches.\" \nJorge Velandia, who came down from the front office to assume a utility-coach role when Mackanin took over, will remain in the organization. It has yet to be determined, however, if he will return to the coaching staff or to the player personnel department. \nBullpen catchers Jesus Tiamo and Bob Stumpo were asked to return. Extra bases \nThe Phillies' attendance of 1,831,080 this season was their lowest since 2002, the team's penultimate year at Veterans Stadium. A half-million fewer fans came to Citizens Bank Park for the third consecutive season. . . . Odubel Herrera became the first Phillies rookie with 30 doubles in a season since Scott Rolen in 1997. . . . Maikel Franco said he plans to play about a month of winter ball with Gigantes del Cibao, his team in his native Dominican Republic. He will likely play beginning in November and ending in December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:54:37.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
