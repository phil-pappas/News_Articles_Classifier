By Vox Populi “To those of you who criticize Dr. Carson’s plan to fight back against a shooter, tell us what you would do.”\n“I don’t know who makes the Hardee’s commercials, but I refuse to go as long as they are so vulgar. And I certainly wouldn’t allow a child to go!”\n“Good old Savannah mail delivery. I just received Joann’s coupons that expired two weeks ago!”\n“I’m fed up with hearing of all these people who are injured in police custody. If they had cooperated, they wouldn’t have gotten injured!”\nContribute to Vox Populi by calling 912-525-0VOX (0869) or emailing us at vox@savannahnow.com .
