Eighty players and coaches from the two school participated in various Coaches vs. Cancer games. The Coaches wore shirts with the phrase \"dig Pink\" on the back. October is breast cancer awareness month so, CVU's Athletic Director, Dan Shepardson challenged his athletic teams to do something special for the cause.\n\"I don't know if there's a student in this school that's been affected by cancer in some way, shape or form or family members or friends,\" Shepardson said. \"It's such a powerful cause and they understand the significance of it. So, to be able to give something back to others and to help others is what we want to encourage. Helping others is what school and education is all about.\"\nThe teams raised around $2,200.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:23:47.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
