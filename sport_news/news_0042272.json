Arrieta carries Chicago to NLDS 1  /  1 Back to Gallery Pittsburgh \nThese Chicago Cubs are supposed to be too young to be here. Or maybe they're just too good to care.\nJake Arrieta allowed four hits in nine dominant innings and the Cubs rolled to a 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL wild-card game on Wednesday night.\nArrieta struck out 11 without a walk. He also dusted himself off after getting plunked by Pittsburgh reliever Tony Watson to send the Cubs to the NL Division Series in St. Louis starting on Friday.\n\"I'm exhausted. I haven't felt this way all year,\" said Arrieta, who led the majors with 22 wins. \"This atmosphere, the energy was unbelievable. Tried to use it to the best of my ability. They were loud, they were really loud.\"\nDexter Fowler homered and scored three times for the Cubs. Kyle Schwarber added a towering two-run shot off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole as Chicago raced to an early lead and let Arrieta do the rest.\nThe largest crowd ever at PNC Park failed to rattle Arrieta or one of baseball's youngest teams. First-year manager Joe Maddon 's club played with swagger and confidence and looked right at home while snapping a nine-game playoff losing streak that dated to the 2003 NL Championship Series .\n\"It's tremendous for the city. It's been a while,\" Arrieta said. \"Chicago's been waiting for this, but it's only step one.\"\nPittsburgh was knocked out after finishing second in the majors with 98 victories this year. Last season, the Pirates also were shut out on four hits at home in the wild-card game, losing to San Francisco.\n\"Well, sports is hard. Life's not fair. You go out and play. You get beat, you move on,\" manager Clint Hurdle said.\nThe bearded, 29-year-old Arrieta, still unbeaten since July 25, stretched his remarkable second half — in which he posted an 0.75 ERA — into the opening round of the playoffs. He threw the first complete-game shutout for the Cubs in the postseason since Claude Passeau tossed a one-hitter in the 1945 World Series against Detroit.\nArrieta even laughed off a weird sequence in the seventh when Watson's fastball hit him in his left side. The benches and bullpens cleared when Watson was issued a warning, leading to little more than a few heated exchanges along the first-base line.\n\"I hit two guys, unintentionally. I'm not trying to hurt or hit anybody,\" Arrieta said. \"Balls were slick tonight. I just lost it a couple of times, it kind of ran away from me.\"\n\"I expected that. They're going to take care of their own guys. It's understandable. Everything after that was fine,\" he said.\nPirates utility player Sean Rodriguez , who'd already been pulled, was ejected and proceeded to give an unsuspecting water cooler a series of one-two combinations, eventually sending it tumbling to the ground.\nPittsburgh had no such luck against Arrieta.\nChicago took a 1-0 lead two batters into the game when Fowler led off with a single, stole second and scored on a single to left by Schwarber.\nThe two hooked up again in the third. Fowler singled with one out and Schwarber turned an 88 mph slider from Cole into a massive two-run shot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:31:16.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
