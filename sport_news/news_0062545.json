And in a tight game, the deciding factor is usually controversial. No one expected less Tuesday as the Frontier Academy and Sterling boys soccer teams fought for the Class 3A Region 4 title. After more than 70 minutes of defensive battle, the Tigers found one opening — according to the referees — to secure a 1-0 win against the Wolverines at Tom Roche Field. The Tigers (5-0 Region 4, 10-5 overall) have claimed the region title after finihsing as runner-up to Frontier’s since 2011. Earlier this month, the Wolverines (6-1, 8-7) also lost 2-1 at Sterling in a nonconference game. Wolverines coach Kennan Reinert said the winning goal was viewed differently by the referees. “It’s all judgment call, right?” Reinert said. “Our referee on our side saw a push (by) their player, and the center ref didn’t see it, so they awarded the goal. “You know, they were able to put it in the net and we were not, and that’s the game of soccer. “ … Soccer is hard, but that’s soccer. You can’t win them all. They played hard and they played for each other, so that was all good.” The ball came off a corner kick and Sterling junior Josh Lechman kicked it over the Frontier defenders’ heads and just out of reach of junior goalkeeper Hunter Umholtz into the back of the net with 7 minutes, 40 seconds left. The referees took a minute to discuss the call and the main referee signaled it was a goal. “I think it’s difficult on a corner like that, but credit to Sterling,” senior Josh Roberts said. “It was a good goal. We can learn from, practice our markings and just move forward from that.” After that, the Wolverines tried to create more opportunities but were held off by Sterling. Their best shot came on a free kick with about 1 minute remaining, but it was too high. Frontier was controlling the ball in the first half, taking eight shots and holding the Tigers to four. But Sterling found a way to limit the Wolverines to one shot in the second. Senior Cameron McPherson said the Wolverines knew they should have scored a goal earlier and should have been more aggressive with their play. “I feel like they pack it in and cleared (the ball) quickly, which made it difficult,” McPherson said of the Tigers defenders. “They definitely focus on the long ball when it came to offense. Usually we can handle that, but today it was different.” Roberts said it was fun to host Sterling for the Wolverines’ senior night and it was a good learning experience before the postseason. “It’s not fun losing, but it still feels good to go out working hard,” he said. Season’s end Frontier finished conference play with just one loss. Reinert said the Wolverines are disappointed, but they have to pick up their heads and get ready for the next game. “It was a tough day to not get it in the net,” he said. “But (I’m) awfully proud of all the players. They played really hard. Our seniors played really hard.” Postseason play The seeding for the 3A state playoffs will be released Sunday by the Colorado High School Activities Association. Frontier expects be on the road for the opening round after finishing 8-7 overall. SHS 0 1 — 1 Scoring — SHS, Josh Lechman (Logan Kiefer) 73:20. Shots — SHS 7, FA 9.
