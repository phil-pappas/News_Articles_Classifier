(AP) - Funeral services are Friday in Clarksdale for Leon C. Bramlett, the 1983 Republican nominee for Mississippi governor.\nBramlett lived most of his life in Clarksdale, where he was a farmer and businessman. He was 92 when he died Monday at his son's home in Bedford, Texas.\nMeredith-Nowell Funeral Home says the funeral is 2 p.m. Friday at First Presbyterian Church in Clarksdale.\nBramlett was Mississippi Democratic Party chairman from 1968 to 1972. He became a Republican in 1976 and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1979.\nHe won the Republican nomination in 1983 but his candidacy was overshadowed by discredited sexual accusations against the Democrat who defeated him, state Attorney General Bill Allain. Bramlett declined to promote rumors about Allain, which were based on an investigation funded by wealthy Republican donors.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
