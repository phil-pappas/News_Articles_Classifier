LOUIS – The Cubs aren’t in Pittsburgh anymore.\nSay what you want about Gerrit Cole, Andrew McCutchen and all the other young talent on that 98-win Pirates team the Cubs swatted away on Wednesday night.\nOn Friday night at Busch Stadium, it was John Lackey’s pitching, a mistake-free group of fielders and maybe even some October inertia that added up to a quick reminder for the Cubs that the road to everywhere they want to be goes through St. Louis.\n“We all know that,” said Jon Lester, the Cubs starter who stared down Lackey into the eighth inning before losing 4-0 in Game 1 of their National League Division Series.\n“That doesn’t matter if you’re us or the Pirates or the Dodgers or the Mets,” said Lester, whose first-inning run was all he allowed until the eighth. “It’s gone through this city for a long time.\n“You look at the banners up there in right center field and you know that. It’s like looking up at Yankee Stadium. You know you’ve got to go through those guys to get where you want to go.”\nThe last time Lester and Lackey were both in this ballpark together in the postseason, they pitched in back-to-back victories for the Red Sox in a 2013 World Series they eventually won.\nLackey was traded to the Cardinals last year. Lester was the first elite free agent pitcher signed by any team over the winter, a $155 million left-hander the Cubs pursued and landed with the vision of a Game 1 playoff start in mind.\n“And potentially a Game 5 start,” general manager Jed Hoyer said Friday afternoon.\nIt looks like it might take that for the Cubs to win this best-of-five series, with untested Kyle Hendricks going in Game 2 on Saturday before they get a chance to send their Cy Young candidate, Jake Arrieta, to the mound at home on Monday.\n“We’re not too frustrated,” said rookie right-fielder Kyle Schwarber, who became the Cubs first base runner when he walked in the fourth — then singled Jorge Soler to third, against Trevor Rosenthal, in a ninth-inning rally that fell short.\n“Obviously, we’re going to have frustration because we lost the game, but we’ve got to go in tomorrow with a clear head and approach it the same way we did today,” said Schwarber – who hit a mammoth, two-run homer in Wednesday’s win in Pittsburgh.\n“It’s not like it’s the wild card, where it’s one and done. It’s a long run. We’re not too worried about it. It happened. We lost. But that’s why there’s four more games if we need them.”\nThe Cubs took issue throughout the game with home-plate umpire Phil Cuzzi’s strike zone.\n“I’m going to get in trouble if I say anything,” said Chris Coghlan, who struck out twice on called third strikes, once against Lackey.\nBut only three other Cubs struck out against Lackey. And Lester struck out nine, without a walk until his final batter in the eighth.\n“I voiced my opinion a couple times, but apparently it was the same zone for both sides, and I really can’t complain,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.\nRegardless of Cuzzi’s GPS, this one was about two playoff-tested veteran starting pitchers, a Cubs reliever (Pedro Strop) who struggled again in St. Louis, and a team that has played in the last four National League Championship Series, two of the last four World Series (winning in 2011) – and that won more games this season (100) than any of those teams.\n“They play really good, sound baseball,” Lester said. “They have really good, sound at-bats every night. They don’t give up pitches, on either side. It’s what makes it tough.\n“But we’re right there with them. There’s no reason we can’t beat these guys.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:07:07.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
