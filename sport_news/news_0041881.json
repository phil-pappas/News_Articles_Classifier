(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The last time the Kansas City Royals faced an 0-2 deficit in the postseason was 30 years ago in the World Series. \nFor a while on Friday at Kauffman Stadium, it looked like these Royals would be in a similar situation — down 0-2 to the Houston Astros in the best-of-five American League Division Series and the season seemingly in peril with Dallas Keuchel waiting in Game 3 on Sunday in Houston. \nBut the resilient Royals rallied from a three-run deficit and evened the series with a 5-4 victory to send the team to Houston with new life. Ben Zobrist’s single to left in the seventh inning scored Alcides Escobar for the winning run. \n“To come back with Esky’s big triple, the opposite way, and then Ben Zobrist driving the ball the opposite way for the game-winner was key,” Royals manager Ned Yost said. “The offense took advantage of opportunities when we had them and found a way to win a baseball game.” \nThe Royals trailed 4-1 early but clawed back with a run in the third, two more in the sixth and one in the seventh. Escobar started the inning with a leadoff triple to right against Houston reliever Will Harris (0-1), and Zobrist followed with a single on the next pitch. Zobrist pumped his fist as Escobar ran toward home to the sound of 40,008 screaming fans, whose voices might have been rendered moot if not for the sixth inning. \nTrailing 4-2 and the thought of Keuchel — who is 15-0 with a 1.48 ERA at home this season — looming large, the Royals evened the score on three hits and two walks, one of them a bases-loaded walk to Salvador Perez. \nThe Royals catcher, who is not known for his plate discipline, didn’t even swing the bat against Houston’s Josh Fields. He held off a first-pitch slider away and then took a ball inside. The third delivery was low and the fourth pitch nearly hit him, and Eric Hosmer walked home from third. \n“That’s smart on Salvy’s part,” Hosmer said. “You got a guy coming in from the bullpen who hadn’t thrown a strike all day, so Salvy was just waiting him out. In that situation, you don’t want to bail him out or hit a groundball-double play and Salvy was just being smart letting the game dictate the play.” \nPerez had two hits, including a home run in the second off Houston starter Scott Kazmir. Kazmir went 51/3 innings and gave up three runs on five hits. Kansas City starter Johnny Cueto also struggled. \nCueto was making his fourth career postseason start, and left the field in the sixth inning still looking for his first playoff win. Cueto, like Yordano Ventura a night earlier, struggled from the outset. The veteran right-hander and pending free agent gave up four runs on seven hits to go with three walks and five strikeouts. \nThe Astros jumped out to a three-run lead heading into the bottom of the third, as Colby Rasmus drove in a run in the first and George Springer plated a pair with a hit in the second. Rasmsus also homered to open the third. But Houston didn’t score again as Kelvin Herrera (1-0), Ryan Madson and Wade Davis ensured that Kansas City will survive until at least Monday. \nFor hours, that possibility looked bleak as Royals fans had little to cheer about on a day that began cloudy and gloomy. But at 4:21 p.m. the sun finally broke through and things only got brighter from there for the Royals. \nThey head to Houston now without the pressure of having to sweep both games, but a sweep would put them in the ALCS. A split in the series would make for a Game 5 on Wednesday at Kauffman Stadium. \n“We go about our business the same way every single day,” said Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas. “We were down 0-1 in the series, and we weren’t going to panic or anything. We were going to go out there and try to find a way to win.” \nNOTES \n■ With Rasmus’ double in the first, he became the first player in big league history to record an extra-base hit in his first six playoff appearances. \n■ Perez’s homer in the second was the second of his postseason career. Perez also homered in Game 1 of last year’s World Series. \n■ First pitch was at 2:47 p.m. The temperature was 58 degrees with a north wind at 10 mph. \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:44:31.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
