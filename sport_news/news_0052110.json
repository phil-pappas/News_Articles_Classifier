The 20 fit players I have available can play in every single game and I'm confident we have a very strong team.\n\"Basically the same team played at Tottenham and won in the League Cup in a much more difficult game physically. It was just that on the night (against Zagreb) we didn't play well.\n\"You have to win your home games if you want to qualify. It's as simple as that. We can't afford to drop points against anybody at home.\"\nStriker Olivier Giroud was sent off in Zagreb and is suspended, while experienced midfielders Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta are out injured.\nThe Greeks, who lost their opening group game 3-0 at home to Bayern Munich, have met Arsenal in three previous campaigns, winning all three home meetings but losing each time in London.\nUnder Wenger, Arsenal have reached the second stage of the competition every season since 1999-2000, but for the past five years in they have gone out in the first knockout round.\nLast season was a particular disappointment with an away goals defeat by unfancied AS Monaco after losing 3-1 at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:24:48.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
