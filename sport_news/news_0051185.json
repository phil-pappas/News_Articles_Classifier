She then appears to plead with the officer to not do anything by saying \"please don't.\"\nAccording to Rachel Nichols of CNN , Crowley also can be heard saying that Manziel didn't hurt her, that she is OK, and she didn't want to do anything about the incident.\nThe pair had been arguing, CNN reported. Manziel told police that the fight got worse when Crowley threw his wallet out of the car, according to CNN. He then told police that he grabbed her wrist to stop her from leaping out of the car.\nPolice also released a photo showing an abrasion on Crowley's arm (seen in the video below). Manziel can be heard admitting to police that he grabbed her arm as he pleaded for her to get back in the car.\nManziel also admitted to police that he had been drinking earlier with the police report saying Manziel \"had consumed only two alcoholic drinks several hours prior,\" according to the Associated Press .\nWe have reached out to Manziel for comment.\nNOW WATCH: Poker champ Annie Duke reveals two keys to dominating your poker night\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/", "http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2015/10/20/johnny-manziel-police-dashcam-girlfriend-nr.cnn.html&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/manziels-girlfriend-to-cop-he-hit-me-a-couple-times/vi-AAfFfo1&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;CNN&quot;,&quot;sourceLogo&quot;:&quot;http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Manziel&#39;s", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfF54M.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfDzvG.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAyrb0&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Dennis", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfCUrg.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Days", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bill", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfDcNe.img&quot;}}", "http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/10/20/johnny-manziel-police-dashcam-girlfriend-nr.cnn", "http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-manziel-could-face-nfl-discipline-for-domestic-incident-2015-10?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=referral", "http://www.businessinsider.com/annie-duke-champ-strategy-dominate-poker-night-2015-9?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=referral", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/van/van-msft-sports&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;ComscoreProviderConfig&quot;:&quot;{\\&quot;ca1\\&quot;:\\&quot;1\\&quot;,\\&quot;ca2\\&quot;:\\&quot;3005117\\&quot;,\\&quot;ca4\\&quot;:\\&quot;CNN_Microsoft\\&quot;,\\&quot;ca6\\&quot;:\\&quot;*null\\&quot;}&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quo", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Manziel"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:40:03.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
