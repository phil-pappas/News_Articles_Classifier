We were able to sustain drives and finish them, which we didn’t do last week.” \nKrauss got plenty of help from sophomore running backs Pat Lodwig and Matt McGrath . Lodwig had a 72-yard touchdown reception and rushed for 54 yards and a score. McGrath added 77 yards on the ground and a touchdown on 11 carries. \nPalisades faced a third-and-5 on Wilson’s 17 on its second series. Krauss pump-faked as if he were going to pass, then tucked it in and took off. The middle of the field opened like the Parting of the Red Sea and Krauss took it into the end zone to give the Pirates an early 7-0 lead. \n“I rolled to my left and was going to throw, but it was covered up real quick,” Krauss said. “Then I started to run and I saw nothing but open grass. The line gave me plenty of time all day.” \nLate in the second quarter a 5-yard punt by Wilson (1-5) gave Palisades possession at the Warriors 35. Krauss hit Blake Cassalia for 30 yards and three plays later Krauss sneaked over from a yard out to give the Pirates a 14-0 lead at halftime. \nPalisades essentially put it away on its first series of the third quarter. Cassalia stopped a Wilson drive with an interception. Four plays later Krauss found Lodwig all alone near the sideline and Lodwig sprinted all the way to the end zone to give the Pirates a commanding 21-0 lead. \n“It was a play-action pass that we run a lot and they bit on it,” Krauss said. “I was going to run but then I saw (Lodwig) out of the corner of my eye so I threw it to him. (Tight end) Tyler Marsh made one of the best blocks I’ve seen all season on that play.” \n“The coaches saw that it would be open,” Lodwig said. “The cornerback bailed and the safety went to the other side. It was a great block by Tyler Marsh and a great ball by Austin. It was a great play by all of us.” \nAnd a great day for Palisades in general. \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @TomHinkelLV .
