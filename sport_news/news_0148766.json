While studying abroad in Spain, he ran Madrid’s Rock N’ Roll Marathon—and missed the official cutoff time for the 2016 Boston Marathon by a single second, according to The Boston Globe.\n“I thought I had the race of my life,” Martinez, 20, told the Globe . “What could I have done in one second to change that? That could be anything. It could be a turn; it could have been me not taking an extra sip of water when I did.”\n Martinez came in at 3 hours, 2 minutes, 33 seconds, meaning he met the qualifying standard in his age bracket for the Boston Marathon (3 hours and 5 minutes, or faster).\nBut he didn’t meet the time required to get a bib to race. For that, race organizers told the Globe he needed a time of 3 hours, 2 minutes, 32 seconds—yep, one second less than he ran.\nReady to move faster, Martinez will try to qualify for the 2017 Boston Marathon at Lowell’s Bay State Marathon, which takes place later this month.\nRead the full story at the Globe .", "external_links": ["http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/10/05/boston-university-student-misses-qualifying-for-marathon-single-second/ABAHlJk1r9SGxz2VtOMX9J/story.html?event=event12"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:24:10.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
