Their next game is Tuesday at Vancouver.\nP.K. Subban and Max Pacioretty each had a goal and assist, while Lars Eller, David Desharnais and Brendan Gallagher also scored for Montreal, which already has an NHL-record nine regulation wins to start the season. \n  \"Our goal is not to break records, it's to win a Stanley Cup,\" said Subban. \"I think we'll save the champagne or whatever anyone expects us to do for another day.\"\nDevils 4, Sabres 3 • In Buffalo, N.Y., Adam Henrique scored twice and added an assist and New Jersey won their its fourth straight. Mike Cammalleri had a goal and two assists, and David Schlemko also scored for the Devils. New Jersey hasn't lost since starting the season 0-3-1.\nBuffalo lost Evander Kane to an apparent left leg injury midway through the third period. A high-profile addition last season, Kane needed to be helped off the ice and did not return.\nPenguins 2, Predators 1 (OT) • In Nashville, Tenn., Phil Kessel scored 41 seconds into overtime to give Pittsburgh the win over Nashville. Chris Kunitz had the other goal for Pittsburgh, which won for the fourth time in five games. James Neal scored for Nashville, which lost at home for the first time this season.\nLess than a minute into overtime, Kessel took the puck toward the Nashville net on the left side. His first shot was denied by Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne, but he was able to tap the rebound in for the win.\nIslanders 3, Blues 2 (OT) • In St. Louis, Mikhail Grabovski scored his first goal of the season 4 minutes into overtime and New York beat St. Louis.
