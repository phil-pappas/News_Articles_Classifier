A conversion would have tied the game. \nInstead, Miles dialed up a fake-field goal call. Holder Derek Helton took the snap and proceeded to toss the ball over his shoulder. Kicker Josh Jasper caught the ball and scampered for the first down. LSU then punched in a touchdown a few plays later for an exciting 33-29 win. \nIn this year's installment of the rivalry between LSU and Florida, will we see similar fireworks? One can bet Miles has a trick or two up his sleeve for a similar situation. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
