She returned from the birth of a daughter to help the Americans win the World Cup this summer in Canada. \n“I feel like it’s the right time and I’m feeling really comfortable about the end of my career,” Boxx said. “After winning the World Cup, I don’t feel like there is anything left to accomplish and I’m proud I was able to make a final comeback and help the team. I’m just really excited to be on the field one more time with my teammates and play in front of my family.” \nThe 28-year-old Holiday scored the winning goal in the United States’ 5-2 victory over Japan in the World Cup final. She has 24 goals in 132 games for the national team. She also recently helped FC Kansas City win its second consecutive NWSL title. \n“It’s been an amazing year and I feel blessed to have had these wonderful experiences at the end of my career,” Holiday said. “The Victory Tour has been fun, but now feels like a good time to say goodbye and it’s great to have the last game be against a quality team like Brazil.” \nThe 31-year-old Chalupny has 10 goals in 105 games for the United States. She has yet to make a final decision on continuing to play for Chicago in the NWSL. \n“There is of course some sadness to see this chapter of my life come to an end, but it’s also a happy time to look back at all the fantastic experiences I’ve had through soccer,” Chalupny said. “It’s great to get the opportunity to play one last game with your friends and to be able to go out on your own terms is a cool thing and certainly something to be appreciated.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:27:32.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
