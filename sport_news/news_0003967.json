The 30-year-old pitcher was limited to 36 games this season because of right shoulder inflammation. As a rookie, he had a 2.77 ERA in 28 games last year. \nThe Dodgers on Wednesday designated right-hander Jim Johnson for assignment. He was 0-3 with one save and a 10.13 ERA in 23 games after being acquired from Atlanta in a July 30 trade. Johnson had been left off the playoff roster.
