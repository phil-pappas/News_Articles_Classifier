The New York Mets second baseman slugged a home run in his sixth consecutive playoff game Wednesday, helping the Mets clinch the National League pennant with a sweep over the Chicago Cubs . Next is the World Series, the team’s first since 2000. Murphy’s record-breaking home run came in the eighth inning of Wednesday’s 8-3 win. He’s the first player to homer in six consecutive postseason games. Murphy batted .529 (9 for 17) in the series. Murphy’ postseason heroics have come as a surprise. The Jacksonville, Florida, native, 30, set a career high for home runs during the 2015 regular season, hitting 14 in 130 games. Now, on the playoff stage, he has hit six homeruns in six games. “I can't explain why balls are going out of the ballpark, but they do, and we keep winning ball games – it's the most important part and the coolest part,” Murphy said after being named the National League Championship Series’ most valuable player. The Mets will play either Toronto or Kansas City in the World Series. The Royals lead 3-2 in the ALCS . Chicago, meanwhile, hasn’t won the championship since 1908.
