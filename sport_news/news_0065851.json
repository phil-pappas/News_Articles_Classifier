I had a great conversation with him (Tuesday) night. We talk via text all the time, but I had a great conversation with him (Tuesday) night. He's somebody who is having a very positive effect on our program and somebody that I really admire as a football coach.\"\nFriedgen, 68, stepped down in February after one season as Rutgers' offensive coordinator. He accepted a role as a consultant, taking a pay cut from $500,000 to $50,000 in the process.\nFriedgen visited during spring practice and training camp , but he spends most of his time at his home at South Carolina. Technology allows him to watch film of every practice and to remain in regular contact with the coaching staff.\n\"He's somebody that is a great resource for me as a head coach because he did the job for over 10 years,\" Flood said. \"A tremendous resource for the offensive staff because he's as good as it gets in all of college football when you talk about offensive coordinators. So, Coach Friedgen has absolutely helped us every week this year and it's been a positive for our program.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:21:12.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
