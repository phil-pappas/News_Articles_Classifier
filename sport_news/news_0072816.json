But SBP vice chairman Ricky Vargas said the trip depends on two things.\nFirst, PBA teams must agree to lend their top players to Gilas and second, the league must adjust its schedule to accommodate the FIBA schedule for the qualifying tournament which will be held in the middle of the PBA season next year.\nJayson Castro is mobbed by fans after Gilas Pilipinas arrived yesterday at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport following their silver medal finish in the FIBA Asia Championship. (John Jerome Ganzon)\n“If we’re going to send a team, we all have to be united in forming a competitive team,” said Vargas.\nVargas also admitted that the SBP faces a dilemma in forming a powerhouse squad for the Olympic qualifying scheduled July 4 to 10 because of the PBA schedule. The Rio Games will take place from Aug. 5 to 21 next year.\nThe Philippines earned one of three qualifying slots for the Olympics in Asia along with Iran and Japan. They will join several other teams from various continents, all of whom had failed to capture outright Olympic slots. Only three more are available after the global eliminations.\nAlso joining the qualifying tournaments are France, Serbia, Greece, Italy, and Czech Republic for Europe; New Zealand for Oceania; Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico for the Americas; and Angola, Tunisia, and Senegal from Africa.\nThe 15 teams will be joined by three other teams, which will come from the host countries where the qualifying tournaments will be held. Only the champion team from each of three qualifying event will advance to Rio.\nVargas fears that the SBP might again fail to form a team it desires.\n“There’s a lot of scheduling problem at that stage, the PBA is ongoing. They (PBA) said that before also (adjusting the schedule). But if the compliance on schedule is only giving us two months to prepare (before the event), I think that’s what they meant,” said Vargas.\nEven though the PBA has openly declared its all-out support to Gilas’ buildup for next year’s Olympic qualifying, Vargas feels team owners have the final say whether it will release its players for national team duties.\n“I think the PBA (Commissioner’s Office) has actually no power in terms of allowing players to join Gilas. At the end of the day it’s still the team owners, who decide if they’ll lend the players to the national team.”\n“They (PBA Office) can say they’ll adjust the schedule, that they’ll support the program of Gilas Pilipinas. Well, they have good intention but hard to implement,” added Vargas.\nLast week, PBA chairman Robert Non said the pro league will help SBP form a strong team.\n“Definitely the PBA will have to make changes in schedule. We’re ready to make a change, and we just have to know the schedule (of Gilas). We have talked about it during the planning session in Tokyo,” said Non.\n“We want to (form a team) but the thing here is if we can form a competitive team,” said Vargas.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:29:19.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
