The remarks formed part of President Pranab Mukherjee after the ceremonial reception at the Presidential house this morning. There has been concern in Israel over India's reiteration of its traditionally strong relations with Palestine and the absence of any mention of violence against Israeli citizens in the city by Palestinians. \"We are disturbed at the recent violence. India condemns all forms of violence. We have always sought peaceful resolution of the dispute,\" the President said. India's consistent policy has been to build a strong, substantive and mutually beneficial relationship with Israel, Mukherjee said in his address at the Israeli Parliament, Knesset, a rare honour accorded by the hosts. Earlier, he paid homage at Parliament before addressing Knesset.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:53:42.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
