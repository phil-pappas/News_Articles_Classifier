Wehrly says the department got a call Tuesday afternoon requesting an ambulance for an unresponsive man at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada about 70 miles outside of Las Vegas. \nA sheriff's statement says Odom was stabilized and taken to Desert View Hospital in nearby Pahrump. \nOfficials then tried to have him flown to a Las Vegas hospital, but he was too tall for the helicopter that was available and he was driven by ambulance. \nThere was no further word on Odom's condition. \nThe 35-year-old retired from the NBA in 2013 and saw reality TV fame through his four-year marriage to Khloe Kardashian.
