The Flying Elephants Delicatessen is located in the OHSU Collaborative Life Sciences Building. The deli has recently extended business hours to include Saturdays and Sundays. Weekenders can now stop by to enjoy some of their hearty food, indulge on sweets and baked goods, or pick up some wine for later.\nTake a short walk along SW Moody Ave. to dine at a new(ish) food cart pod, The Gantry at Zidell Yards . This small collection of carts has a seating area and currently has six carts open, with a few more that appear to be in the works.\nRelated: Portland's best new food carts of 2015\nA popular cart is Namu , offering Korean/Hawaiian fusion cuisine.\nDon't forget to look across the street to Scout Beer Garden which typically has 10 or more beers on tap.\nAcross the street in the bottom of The Emery apartment building are a few other places to check out. Among them are Greenleaf Juicing Company , Lovejoy Bakers , and The Geezer Gallery, a non-profit art gallery that gives senior artists exhibition opportunities.\nSaunter on over to the Portland Aerial Tram , and hop a ride to the top to take in the view.\nFor bikers, use the free valet bike service at Go By Bike to park your ride while you ride the tram or dine. Or perhaps, you've got a flat? They can help you with that too.\nContinue along Moody Ave. and walk through the petite Elizabeth Caruthers Park.\nFollow the brick pathway on SW Pennoyer St. to visit the South Waterfront Greenway where you can finally rest and take in the beautiful view of the river.\n--Kristyna Wentz-Graff\n@kwgphoto", "external_links": ["http://catchtheorange.com/#/", "https://www.facebook.com/TheGantryAtZidellYards"], "published": "2015-09-30T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:29:09.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
