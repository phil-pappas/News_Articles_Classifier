Bringing it from the back . In Parkland coach Patrick Birns' ideal world, the Trojans are getting offensive support from their outside backs. Parkland looked much more dangerous in the second half when the wide backs got into attack, which eventually led to Mark Stenske setting up Byron Derti's pummeling volley. \nAs a whole though, if the Trojans are positive from those wide positions, it helps their tempo. \n\"We’re a team that’s fast-paced, but sometimes we don’t play fast-paced,\" Birns said. \"In the first half, we didn’t play with any kind of pace or urgency at all, in the second half we did. That was the difference for us.\" \n2. One half is not enough . Birns was sure to point out that District 11's top teams -- Emmaus, Liberty, Pocono Mountain East -- won't be topped by just 40 minutes of play. \n\"Hopefully this shows guys that it’s fun to play this way, you score goals and it’s exciting, but we can’t turn it on and off like we did today,\" he said. \nEighty minutes of what Parkland did in the second half would be tough to stop, though. \n\"If we come out against every team like we did in that second half, I think we can beat every team in the Valley,\" Derti said. \n3. Lost in the wash . When a team loses 3-0, it's easy to lose sight of the nice defensive performances that happened prior to the scoring explosion. Vikings center back Patrick McLaughlin , however, had a solid first half of defending. The senior made three great tackles to halt separate Parkland attacks. \n4. Men at work . Tuesday's game was played on the grass field next to Parkland soccer's typical stadium, which is currently having an artificial surface installed. The field isn't bad, but the trees and steep hill on the west side make losing balls extremely easy. So, kudos to the Parkland's ball boys for managing the rough conditions -- while probably only being paid with snack stand candy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:09:24.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
