The tweaker bowled Cowan in the 25th over and then had Steve Smith stumped on the very next delivery for a golden duck.\nAfter starting the season with scores of 143 not out against the Cricket Australia XI and 72 against South Australia, Smith has failed to trouble the scorers in his last two games.\nBut with Maddinson in fine touch the result never looked in doubt for NSW. The 23-year-old raised his century off just 104 deliveries and then hit a huge six off Evan Gulbis to seal victory in the 38th over. Mitchell Starc tore through Tasmania’s batting order. Source: News Corp Australia\nEarlier in the day Starc wreaked havoc with the ball, finishing with figures of 5-39 to bowl the Tigers out for 217.\nIn fairness to the Tigers, they did make Starc work for it. It wasn’t until the 19th over that the world’s best white-ball bowler opened his account, knocking over Dom Michael for 54.\nBefore that Gurinder Sandhu had accounted for Tim Paine (5) and Nathan Lyon had dismissed Ben Dunk for 23.\nImpressive knocks from George Bailey (48) and James Faulkner (51) ensured the Tigers passed 200, but when the latter fell to Starc, the big left-hander clicked into gear, taking four wickets in nine deliveries.\nElsewhere, Victoria beat Western Australia thanks to a big performance from Glenn Maxwell.\nOriginally published as Starc and Maddinson tame Tigers", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/matador-cup-scores-new-south-wales-beat-tasmania-thanks-to-mitchell-starc-and-nic-maddinson/story-fn2mcu3x-1227566466178", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/12/1227566/465201-a0d9d24c-70aa-11e5-b58e-513980d2e896.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:00:39.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
