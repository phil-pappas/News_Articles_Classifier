Cyclo what?\nCyclocross is a form of bicycle racing held on a 1&frac12;- to 2-mile course featuring pavement, wooded trails, grass, steep hills and obstacles requiring the rider to quickly dismount, carry the bike while navigating the obstruction and remount.\nWhile the sport is strongest in traditional road-cycling countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands, one of its longest and most successful American venues is in the Green Belt Park in Harbor Town on Mud Island in Memphis.\nAnd that's where Leopold and 150-plus other competitors, both young and old, will be on Nov. 1 when Memphis-based Outdoors Inc. hosts its 29th Cyclocross Championship, which race director Joe Royer says is \"America's oldest cyclocross race.\"\nThe course wraps around the park, taking bikers up hills and over barricades. Once again, this year's barricades will be cottonwood trees pulled out of the nearby Mississippi River. Bikers will sweep around the course in 10 to 50 minutes, depending on age and category.\n\"The shorter duration and varying obstacles heighten the challenge,\" says Leopold, 44, who lives in Germantown and has participated in the event more than 20 times. \"I have raced all over the country and the OICX (as the race is dubbed) is a premier cyclecross race right in our backyard. It is the highlight of my racing calendar.\"\nActivities will start on Nov. 1 with registration at 8 a.m. Races are scheduled to begin at 9 (C race/children), 9:20 (B race/and all women) and 10 (A race/pro and expert).\nJoel Glasgow, who works for Outdoors Inc., is the course designer. He recently attended the World Cup, which was held in the U.S. for the first time, not on Las Vegas' famous strip but at a nearby soccer complex.\n\"It'll be a challenging course for the pros and experts,\" Glasgow says.\nAnd that's OK with Leopold, who first name is actually Boomer and who got his start in cycling as a college student at Ole Miss when he used his first bike for transportation around campus.\nNow, he owns five bikes, including one he uses to compete in cyclocross.\n\"Over the years that (cycling) developed into what my wife might say was an addiction,\" says Leopold, who also competes in other racing events, including triathlons, Ironman and mountain biking.\n\"The thing about cyclocross is that it is short and intense with constant activity,\" Leopold says. \"You are on and off your bike. You get into a rhythm. There is no slack time. And all the while the spectators are cheering. Not necessarily for you, but everyone ... even if you aren't having a good day.\"\nThis is a sport where accidents happen.\nLeopold isn't sure how many broken bones or cracked ribs he has had over the years.\n\"That's something you don't think about,\" he says with a laugh. \"We're all competitors. There is lot of young kids out there now trying to win just as hard as I am trying to win.\"\nSpeaking of young kids, there will be plenty of children, too.\n\"We'll even have a 50-yard dash for kids (3-5 years old) on tricycles,\" Royer says. \"We'll have an intermediate children's race that will be on grass where they can ride their bikes but they don't have to go over any barricades.\"\nIn previous years, the winners have been renowned cyclists from over the U.S., including national cyclocross champions Paul Curley, Steve Tilford and Frank McCormick.\nRoyer, 67, started cyclocross racing in Memphis in 1986 at Shelby Farms.\n\"A lot of people who come to watch will bring cowbells and other noisemakers,\" Royer says. \"We'll have about 150 racers and thousands of spectators. It is fun to see these people race.\"\nThat's easy for him to say since Royer no longer competes.\nTell that to Leopold.\n\"I tell you what sets this apart from some other places I have competed,\" Leopold says. \"It's the folks at Outdoors Inc. and all the volunteers and the fans. That's who. The fans are great. They are cheering all the time.\"\nSo, while he takes his morning bike ride at 4:30 this week as part of his 150-200 miles of weekly preparation, Leopold will be alone with his thoughts, but he'll be pedaling for a reason on Nov. 1, knowing that a portion of the proceeds will go to the Church Health Center.\n\"When I pick up my bike (which weighs 17 pounds) and go over that first barricade, the race will be on,\" Leopold says. \"Some people I know don't understand why I do what I do, but it is still the thrill of chase.\"\nFor more information, contact Royer at joeroyer@outdoorsinc.com or go to outdoorsinc.com.\nGot an outdoors item of note?
