Landry Jones is expected to make his first NFL start against the Chiefs (1-4). Jones threw two second-half touchdown passes to Martavis Bryant last week in a home victory over Arizona. \nMurphy made the team out of training camp as an undrafted free agent out of Boston College before moving to the practice squad. He will serve as the backup behind Jones. \nTo make room for Murphy on the roster, the Steelers placed cornerback Cortez Allen on injured reserve with a knee injury. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:25:39.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
