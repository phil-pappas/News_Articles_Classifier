In the 35-28 victory over Florida this past weekend, Domingue scored his first-career touchdown on a perfectly-executed fake field goal . He took a short pass from holder (and backup quarterback) Brad Kragthorpe , and scampered 16 yards for the eventual game-winning score. Domingue on fake FG: \"Perfect spot on the field where we want to run it.\" #LSU pic.twitter.com/P6iq3wyOWP â€” Ross Dellenger (@DellengerAdv) October 19, 2015 \nAs Domingue relived the moment, he admitted that \"I was pretty nervous, and my hands were shaking. My whole body was shaking.\" \nDomingue didn't play organized football until his junior year of high school. Throughout this time, he was solely a kicker and had no opportunity to have the ball in his hands. \nBased on the speed he demonstrated this past Saturday, his high school coach may have regretted not using Domingue as a skill player.
