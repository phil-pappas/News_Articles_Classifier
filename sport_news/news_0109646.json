The once-weekly meetings have been a staple for Lembo since he started coaching some 15 years ago. \nAbout 20 players, including three from each class, meet on Monday nights to discuss areas in need of improvement. Despite Ball State’s current four-game losing streak, Lembo said this week’s council was one of the most positive, thoughtful and productive he’s seen in a “very, very long time.” \nIt was a bright spot as the team pushes through a tough stretch. It reminded the fifth-year Ball State coach why he enjoys his job. \n“Sometimes you’re plugging along and you’re in the grind of the season and you’ve got the blinders on,” Lembo said. “You don’t think about all those little things that sometimes you might take for granted.” \nWhen he’s not meeting with offensive, defensive and special teams coaches, he’s in administrative meetings and answering emails. He gets a quick word in with the team Sunday night, then again after each weekly practice. And he’s got Friday nights to hammer home some last-minute thoughts before Saturday games. \nBut those meetings sometimes just aren’t enough. It’s up to veterans, Lembo said, to make sure the message is delivered consistently. They’re together on the sidelines during practice, they’re in the film room together. They simply have more time to talk through things. \n“Sometimes what they hear from their peers is more important than what they hear from me or somebody on the staff,” Lembo said. \nGeorgia State knocked off Ball State last week, notching its fourth-ever Football Bowl Subdivision victory in doing so. Freshman kicker Morgan Hagee, now 12 of 16 on field goal tries this year, hit on two attempts in the loss. He’s been on a roll of late, but Lembo sure wishes Hagee wasn’t kicking so frequently. \nThose, after all, are missed opportunities for touchdowns. While the Cardinals couldn’t punch the ball into the end zone offensively, the defense gave up 17 points in the second quarter. Something has been off in the secondary, but Lembo hasn’t quite been able to put his thumb on it. \nMaybe it’s a matter of guys lacking discipline. Lembo said after the loss to Georgia State that players have been “freelancing,\" or making selfish plays. While he’s hopeful that his veterans can bring some answers to the table, he’s not pinning any losses on them. \n“I take responsibility,” he said. “I don’t want to say this in a negative way, but I think the head coach needs to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders. \n“I don’t ever want to change that. It was a disappointment, but you’ve got to move forward.” \nLembo said his guys won’t have any problems getting over the loss, and he’s looking forward to a great week of practice. Amidst a string of tough losses, sometimes it’s the little things that keep guys going. \nFor Lembo, this week, he found a silver lining in team meetings. \n“At the end of the day, it’s about people and it’s about relationships,” Lembo said. “We can’t forget about why we do what we do.” \nContact Ball State sports reporter Dakota Crawford at dmcrawford@muncie.gannett.com or follow @DakotaCrawford _.
