Johnson is on the final day of his four day trade visit to Japan. (Stefan Rousseau/PA via AP) UNITED KINGDOM OUT \nLONDON (AP) — There may have been bruises but there were no hard feelings after London Mayor Boris Johnson knocked over a 10-year-old Japanese boy during a game of rugby. \nSports fan Johnson plowed into Toki Sekiguchi Thursday while thundering down a turf-covered street rugby pitch in Tokyo. \nAfter they both got up, Johnson asked whether the boy was OK before shaking his hand and saying “I’m so sorry.” \nLater the pair posed for photographs and Johnson gave Sekiguchi a rugby ball. \nThe boy said that he “felt a little bit of pain,” but it had been “enjoyable” meeting the mayor. \nJohnson, who is on a trade visit to Japan, said later that he felt “terrible” about the collision. \n“Poor little guy, I hope he is all right,” he said. “He seemed very cheerful afterwards. He bounced back. That’s a metaphor for life.” \nIt is not the first time Johnson, famous for his ebullient manner and shock of blond hair, has collided with a youngster. Last year he knocked over a 9-year-old during a soccer match.
