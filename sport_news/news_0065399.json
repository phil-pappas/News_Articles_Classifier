Williamson, a former McLaren Autosport BRDC Award winner is also a key part of Strakka Performance, the teams driver development programme is looking forward to his first proper sports car test. I have proper opportunity to show sports car teams what I can do at this test, says Williamson. After not racing last year, I want to prove where I am performance-wise. The Gibson 015S has more downforce than Ive been used to but I have some sim sessions planned to make the most of the test. Sports car racing is where I want to be. Thanks to Strakka Racing I have a chance to show what I can do! Lewis has demonstrated real maturity and has been a true asset for Strakka Performance in the last year, adds team principal Dan Walmsley. Inside and outside the car and through the support he provides to all the drivers on our development programmes, he has shown true professionalism and its great that Strakka is able to give him his first proper sports car test. Strakka Racing is planning to announce next week another driver to share duties during the Rookie test.
