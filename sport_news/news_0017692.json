The last meeting ended a two-game winning streak for Tech. MSU needed overtime to knock off the Conference USA opponent. \nThe two have never met since Dan Mullen arrived in Starkville. Mississippi State has won 10 consecutive non-conference games and 14 in a row against non-SEC teams at home. MSU should be well-prepared for Louisiana Tech thanks to Manny Diaz. MSU’s defensive coordinator held the same position at Tech last year. \n3 THINGS WE’RE TALKING ABOUT \nComing in bunches \nDan Mullen vowed once Mississippi State’s defense created a turnover, more would follow. Brandon Bryant blitzed on the third defensive play last week, sacked the quarterback and forced a fumble. Nelson Adams fell on the ball in the end zone for the score. Beniquez Brown came up with an interception on the third play of the second half. It was the first game this season that MSU won the turnover margin. Before the two takeaways, Mississippi State had forced one turnover in its last four games. \nHomecoming \nMississippi State celebrates homecoming against Louisiana Tech. MSU has won five games in a row on homecoming. Mullen is 5-1 in those games. His only loss came to Houston in 2009. While there are some blowouts like 55-17 against UT Martin and 45-3 against Middle Tennessee, MSU escaped with a one-point win when it played Bowling Green in 2013. \nSpecial players \nWestin Graves is 7 for 7 in field-goal attempts this season. He’s the first Bulldog kicker since 1990 to make his first seven kicks to start a season. The sophomore is one of nine players in the FBS that remain perfect after at least seven attempts. He’s also a perfect 21 of 21 in PATs. Graves is one of a handful of productive players on special teams. Fred Ross returned a punt 77 yards for a touchdown last week. Brandon Holloway returned a kick 100 yards in the season opener. GAME-DAY DATA \nWhere: Davis Wade Stadium, Starkville \nTelevision: SEC Network \nLast meeting: 26-20 OT MSU, 2011 \nAll-time series: MSU 8-3 KEEP AN EYE ON \nJeff Driskel, QB: The former Florida quarterback is playing like the star everyone expected in The Swamp. He’s averaging more than 300 passing yards per game with 11 touchdowns and only three interceptions. UNIT THAT COULD GIVE MSU FITS \nLouisiana Tech running backs: Kenneth Dixon will be the best running back on the field Saturday. He already holds five NCAA records and is the nation’s leading career rusher at seven yards shy of 4,000. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1RM6lsm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:02:53.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
