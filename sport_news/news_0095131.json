Yreka downed the Anderson Lady Cubs 23-25, 25-14, 25-17, 25-15 to improve to 14-11 for the season. “It was a great team effort overall,” Lady Miners head coach Scott Eastman said. “We’ve been waiting for them to play with that type of passion and energy for two months,” he added. “I was really happy for them that they were able to put this type of game together in front of the home crowd.” While Yreka has been inconsistent this season, Eastman hopes Tuesday’s game is “a turning point” for the Lady Miners. Senior Taylor Callahan had a memorable game for Yreka and finished with 15 kills and nine blocks. Senior Katie Bennett also had a strong game and had 18 service points and 13 kills. Junior Rebekah Kimball had 14 service points and 12 digs for Yreka. In the first set, Yreka came out with great energy and focus and took a 15-9 advantage. The Lady Cubs bounced back and won the first set 25-23. Eastman said that the team let too many blocked balls get by, but did a great job fixing the problem to take control of the game the rest of the way. The Lady Miners took the momentum away fromAnderson in the second set and cruised to a 25-17 win. Yreka continued to dominate to take the next two sets and win the game in front of a loud and enthusiastic group of home fans. In the junior varsity contest, Yreka downed Anderson 25-19, 25-19.
