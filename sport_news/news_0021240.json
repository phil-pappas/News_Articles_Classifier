They been there for me from the jump. Nobody has shown much love as them in the recruiting process,\" he wrote. \"It's been great knowing you guys and getting to have some close brothers. The Oregon Family is great and will only get stronger from here. I think I'm just trying to say that I want to make the best decision for myself. I want to pick the best college fit for myself and my family. You guys will be my brothers forever. I'm just letting you guys know that I'm staying committed to the University of Oregon. Love all Yall.\"\nWhile there was speculation that Georgia, Florida and possibly Michigan could enter the picture for Mayden, he seemed close to solid talking about Oregon after his visit.\n\"I'm pretty sure I'll stay committed. I just don't want to have any doubts,\" he said. \"I just want to make sure I'm 100 percent committed.\"\nThat stance was bolstered by his official visit, which also featured fellow commit Dillon Mitchell, La'Mar Winston, Brady Breeze and Cam McCormick.\n\"I thought it went really good. The stadium really amazed me â€“ how loud it got during the game. It was pretty loud,\" Mayden said. \"It was a great atmosphere at the game, even before the game. I really enjoyed it.\"\nOregon has been struggling on the field this year, and that may create a little more drama on the recruiting trail, but so far the Ducks have managed to keep its top-25 class largely intact.\nHere's the class of 2016 so far:\nThe Ducks have 14/15 known commitments in the class of 2016:\n4* S Brady Breeze , 6-1, 200, Central Catholic HS (Portland, OR)\n4* ATH La'Mar Winston , 6-2, 210, Central Catholic HS (Portland, OR)\n4* CB Jared Mayden , 6-0, 195, Sachse High School (Sachse, TX)\n4* DE/LB Bryson Young , 6-5, 220, Buchanan High School (Clovis, California)\n3* TE Cam McCormick , 6-5, 235, Summit HS (Bend, OR)\n3* OL Jacob Capra , 6-5, 270, Placer HS (Auburn, CA)\n4* WR Dillon Mitchell , 6-1, 190, White Station HS (Memphis, TN)\n4* QB Terry Wilson , 6-3, 190, Del City High School (Del City, OK)\n3* OLB Hunter Kampmoyer , 6-4, 235, Bishop Union HS (Bishop, CA)\n3* RB Vavae Malepeai , 6-0, 190, Mililani HS (Mililani, HI)\n4* LB Darrian Franklin , 6-1, 215, Downey HS (Downey, CA)\n3* OT Logan Bathke , 6-6, 260, Lutheran HS (Orange, CA)\n3* LB/S Troy Dye , 6-3, 205, Norco High School (Norco, CA)\n3* QB Justin Herbert , 6-5, 215, Sheldon High School (Eugene, OR)\n4* QB Seth Green, 6-4, 210, Allen High School (Allen, TX) -- Rumored de-commit\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "https://twitter.com/MaydenII/status/654698428375543809", "http://t.co/jNGwei7PfB", "http://sports.yahoo.com/ccc/football/recruiting/player-Darrian-Franklin-161367"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:18:57.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
