Show Caption Previous Next \nRunning back Devin Harper took care of the first half scoring, and quarterback Greg Tye took care of the second as Karns knocked off visiting Powell 63-42 on Thursday night. \nThe win gave Karns (2-5) its first multiple win season since 2011 and snapped a five-game winning streak against Powell (0-7) in the series. \n\"It's huge for our program,\" Karns coach Tobi Kilgore said. \"Our kids are getting better each week.\" \nHarper scored three times in the first half, hitting paydirt on a 58-yard screen pass and runs of 38 and 32 yards. By halftime, the Oklahoma State commit had accounted for 146 yards on 10 carries and 55 yards receiving. \n\"Our game plan is always to get (No.) 15 the ball,\" Kilgore said. \"If people haven't figured that out yet, they're crazy.\" \nHarper's third touchdown stretched the Beavers' lead to 28-7. But Jamil Birden and Powell responded. The Panthers scored on a 3-yard jump pass from Birden to Bryson Cowden to pull within 28-21. Birden carried the ball 21 times in the first half, most of which came out of the wildcat. \n\"He's been getting better and better,\" first-year Powell coach Rodney Ellison said. \"We put that in last week.\" \nTye tossed two second-half touchdown passes and added two rushing TDs. His second rushing touchdown with 8 minutes, 59 seconds left in the fourth quarter stretched the Beavers' lead to 56-35. \n\"When they get too many guys in the box, we just (count the players in the box),\" Kilgore said. \"We throw the screen game and let those guys try to make plays.\" \nPowell quarterback Carson Cole hit Brandon Smith for a 65-yard touchdown pass to pull the Panthers within two touchdowns late, but Harper's fourth touchdown nixed the comeback. Harper finished with 265 rushing yards. \n\"Harper is a Division I player,\" Ellison said. \"He may be the best running back we've seen this year.\" \nPatrick Givens is a freelance contributor.
