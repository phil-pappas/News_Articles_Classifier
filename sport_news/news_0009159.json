Both players will no doubt have a big part to play this season. \n\"The games between ourselves and Dragons are normally very competitive and they have played very well in their last two visits to Scotstoun. \n\"The Dragons have a very settled squad, so we're expecting another tough encounter tomorrow evening. \n\"We're expecting another capacity crowd at Scotstoun, which is a real boost and shows just how much rugby is growing in the city.\" \nFollowing the narrow defeat to Munster a fortnight ago, Rory Hughes keeps his place at full-back and Lee Jones continues on the left wing, with Naiyaravoro coming in to make up the back-three. \nDunbar partners Fraser Lyle in midfield, with Rory Clegg and Grayson Hart continuing their half-back partnership. \nZander Fagerson comes in for D'arcy Rae at tight-head, with Alex Allan named at loose-head and Pat MacArthur at hooker. \nRob Harley and Scott Cummings are once again in the Warriors engine room, with Harley continuing to captain the side. \nHugh Blake moves into the back-row and starts at blind-side flanker, with Chris Fusaro and Adam Ashe remaining at open-side and number eight respectively. \nNew signings Greg Peterson and Simone Favaro have been named among the replacements and could make their competitive debuts for the club.
