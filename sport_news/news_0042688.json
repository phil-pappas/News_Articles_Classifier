Because it gave us the adversay with the Hollywood good looks, the star quarterback with the supermodel wife and the UGG boots and all those Super Bowl rings whom Manning had to beat, at least once, in January, for his résumé to not to have a giant asterisk. \nWe love this rivalry because when the Indianapolis Colts meet the New England Patriots, the wins are sweeter, the losses saltier. We love it because it’s given us an NFL morality play that’s been downright irresistible for 15 years. \nWe love it because Kevin Faulk couldn’t get two yards on 4th-and-2, because Tom Brady never saw Marlin Jackson streaking across the middle, because of Willie McGinest’s magically healed left knee. \nWe love it because of the irony. Because of all the teams a 23-year-old low-level grunt named Bill Belichick could’ve begun his NFL coaching career with in 1975, he began it with the Baltimore Colts. Because of all the teams a little-known, sixth-round draft pick named Tom Brady could’ve made his first-ever NFL start against in 2001, he made it against the Indianapolis Colts. \nWe love it because no Colts’ win means more to this city than a Colts’ win over the Patriots, over Belichick, over Brady. Why? Because no team in the Colts’ 63-year history has handed them more losses in the regular season (46) or the playoffs (4) than you-know-who. How many rivalries churn out storylines like this one? How many stay relevant this long? How many incite this much vitriol between fan bases? How many produce games you can remember by a single down-and-distance (The 4th-and-2 Game)? Or a single player (The Willie McGinest Game)? How many rivalries include a chapter that ends in America's favorite suffix – gate? \nWe love it because these teams love sticking it to one another. Five days before a 2013 divisional playoff game in New England, the Colts not-so-suspiciously signed longtime Patriot Deion Branch, a 34-year-old receiver who hadn’t seen an NFL field in nearly a year. So, Deion, what can you tell us about the Patriots? Call it a costly bit of gamesmanship – Branch wasn’t even active for the game but made $23,000 for a week’s worth of work.

Where did Joseph Addai, Austin Collie and Reggie Wayne all end their careers? The answer: Foxborough, Mass., and not likely by coincidence. So, guys, what can you tell us about the Colts? The worst part? Neither Addai or Wayne even made it through training camp. \nWe love this rivalry because this game matters darn near every single year. Because the regular season games have playoff implications and because the playoff games have Super Bowl implications – four of the five times these two have met in the postseason, the winner's gone on to become world champion. Because only one team won more games during the 2000s than the Patriots – the Colts. Because only one team has won more division titles since 2002 than the Colts – the Patriots. Because only three times in the past 12 years has an AFC Championship Game not featured one of the two. “The best parts about these is you always have two good teams going at it.” Kicker Adam Vinatieri, who's played 10 years with both franchises \nWe love this rivalry because it’s altered the way professional football is played. So incensed at the clutching, the grabbing, the bumping by Patriot defensive backs on his receivers in the 2004 AFC title game, then-Colts president Bill Polian aired his complaints to the league competition committee that summer. The rule was changed. Penalties skyrocketed. So did the points. Manning threw 49 touchdowns the following season. Offenses, like the one in New England, have been on a tear ever since. \nWe love it because it gave us Deflategate, an eight-month soap opera that filled the dry months of summer with a scandal too titillating to ignore. Because it gave us text messages from a New England locker room attendant named Jim McNally calling himself “The Deflator,” and a pair from another, John Jastremski, that read, “Tom is acting crazy about balls\" and \"Ready to vomit!” Because it gave us the 243-page Wells Report and phrases like “more probable than not” and “at least generally aware.” \nBecause of all the teams to tip the NFL about their concerns regarding the Patriots’ supposed deflation of footballs, it was the Colts. Because there’s not a chance, not even after his four-game suspension was overturned, that Brady has let that fact slip his mind. Because only these two, only the Colts and the Patriots, would find themselves entangled in a knot this messy, adding more explosives to a game where the cannons were already loaded.
