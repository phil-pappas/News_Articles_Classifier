Guy McCarthy / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Three weeks after a blaze sparked in Amador County and roared into Calaveras County to unleash one of the region’s worst calamities in a century, lawyers from San Diego to San Andreas jockeyed for position with Butte Fire victims to sue one of the largest utilities in North America for its alleged role in igniting the blaze. A group of lawyers based in San Diego filed a complaint Tuesday targeting Pacific Gas and Electric and a maintenance contractor called Trees, Inc., on behalf of Butte Fire victims Brian Moeller and Jolene Stewart, alleging negligence for sparking the blaze authorities say resulted in two fatalities, destroyed 475 homes and burned more than 110 square miles. News of the complaint filed in Calaveras County Superior Court Civil Division emerged Tuesday evening as more than 100 people gathered at San Andreas Town Hall to hear from a different group of attorneys who want to sue PG&E on their behalf, led by Airola & Airola of San Andreas. A third group of attorneys calling themselves ButteFireLawyers.com has distributed flyers on windshields of vehicles at recent community meetings in towns including Pine Grove and San Andreas seeking victims of the Butte Fire. Singleton Law Firm of Solano and Sparacino Law Corporation of San Diego allege in their complaint on behalf of Moeller and Stewart that the Butte Fire started in Amador County when electrical infrastructure owned, operated and maintained by PG&E came into contact with vegetation inspected and maintained by PG&E and Trees, Inc. Attorneys John Airola, Steven Airola, Eric Ratinoff, Brett Parkinson and Robert W. Jackson said Tuesday evening they’ve examined the tree in question, which they say is in a Cal Fire evidence locker in Auburn. Asked whether they have visited Charamuga Ranch, where residents say they believe the Butte Fire started under a power line that crosses their property, none of the attorneys said they have been there. Bill and Aileen Charamuga, both 86 and married since October 1949, said Tuesday at their ranch they have not been interviewed by any investigators. The Union Democrat reported Sept. 18 the Charamugas are convinced the Butte Fire ignited nine days earlier in a location near their home just off Butte Mountain Road. The group calling themselves Butte Fire Lawyers said they have two attorneys, Tom Tosdal and Terry Singleton, who were selected to be the lead trial counsel on behalf of all plaintiffs in power line cases against San Diego Gas and Electric in the destructive Witch, Guejito and Rice Canyon blazes in 2007. The Witch Fire resulted in two fatalities and destroyed 1,650 structures, according to Cal Fire. “Most of you have heard about attorneys descending on this area,” John Airola told people who filled all the chairs set up in San Andreas Town Hall, and others who came a few minutes late and unstacked more chairs to sit. “We are very concerned about how you people get treated up here,” John Airola said. In an earlier announcement about the meeting, John Airola said the Butte Fire hit home for him on a personal level when he helped his mother evacuate. “The duties and obligations of a utility company, all of you have already prepaid to avoid exactly what happened when that tree fell into that power line,” Jackson said. “You pay for that every month. They have the responsibility to clear the trees and maintain their lines. It’s a quid pro quo. We impose a liability on them if they don’t maintain their lines.” Arborists and botanists examined the tree in question at Cal Fire’s evidence locker in Auburn, Jackson said. “It came into contact with a power line and it arced, it sparked and sent molten aluminum down to the ground,” Jackson said. “And that is what sparked the Butte Fire.” Ratinoff told people at the meeting to make sure they get copies of their insurance policies. “We brought about 60 disposable cameras for those of you who lost phones and cameras in the fire,” Ratinoff said. “Take photos to document your losses. Every one of those rolls of film will be put on digital CDs so it’s easy to send and share.” The Airolas, Ratinoff, Parkinson and Jackson do not intend to file a class action, Ratinoff said. “Every single person has a unique set of circumstances,” Ratinoff said. “There will be a consolidation of cases for review by a judge. But each case will be individual.” A woman who came to the meeting asked how the lawyers will be paid. “A contingency fee,” Ratinoff answered. “We will be paid a percentage of what we recover on your behalf from PG&E. If we make no recovery, we get no fee.” Ratinoff warned people against expecting too much from their insurance companies. “Insurance companies have a specific model,” Ratinoff said. “They collect premiums and deny claims. Does that mean that all claims are denied? No. But through diminution of value, they’re very sophisticated about how they keep claims down. They’ve been doing it not for years, for generations.” Ratinoff also told people at the meeting they can be confident insurance companies are planning their own litigation against PG&E to recover whatever they have to pay out to their insured clients who suffered losses in the Butte Fire. Michael Feinberg of the Butte Fire Lawyers also emphasized his group has no intention of filing a class action. “We will specifically file individual actions on behalf of all our clients,” Feinberg said Tuesday night in a phone interview. “We will not file a class action under any circumstances.” San Diego Gas and Electric burned down about 20 percent of San Diego County in 2007 when the utility sparked three different fires, Jackson said. Last week, San Diego Gas and Electric requested authority to bill its customers $379 million for costs left over from the destructive 2007 wildfires in northern San Diego County, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Tuesday night, Lynsey Paulo of PG&E corporate relations released the following statement for the utility: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the individuals who lost their homes in this fire. We are going to continue supporting our customers and working with our first responder partners and the state of California to improve fire safety and fire response. “We will respond to this lawsuit in the normal legal process. As we’ve said since September 16, we are cooperating fully with Cal Fire in its investigation on the source of the ignition for the Butte fire. “We want to reassure our customers that we at PG&E take the risk of wildfires very seriously and are focused on doing everything possible to mitigate the risk of fire during this drought.” Jackson and John Airola told people at the meeting “There is power in numbers.” “There are going to be people who propose class actions,” Jackson said. “You want to avoid that like the plague. We promise we’re going to treat each case individually, prosecuted as a mass tort, to put you back whole like you were before the fire.” Some people put their names, addresses, phone numbers and emails on forms when they came in San Andreas Town Hall, and some did so when they left. Others took copies of client information sheets to return to the attorneys. Outside the meeting at San Andreas Town Hall, a granddaughter of the Charamugas said she could not say anything for the record. She said she’s been dogged by investigators in recent weeks.
