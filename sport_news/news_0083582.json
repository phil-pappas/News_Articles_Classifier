The Traverse City Hounds and the second-year Kalkaska Rhinos joined the U.S. Premier Hockey League's Midwest Division last offseason. \n\"The new league for us is really good,\" Hounds Head Coach Jacek Wilk said. \"It was much easier to recruit players to play here, since it's USA hockey. Last year, it wasn't. So, yeah, we've been fortunate enough to get the players that we wanted, and we're very successful in the season, so far.\" \nThe Hounds have had no problems winning with their players. T.C. won it all each of their last two seasons in the Midwest Junior Hockey League. However the new league should provide better competition. \nThe Rhinos enjoy the solidified schedule after playing as an independent last season. \n\"We got lucky enough that the USPHL inahled the Midwest Junior Hockey League,\" Rhinos Head Coach Kyzysztof Oliwa. \"We basically applied and we're just very happy to here at this point and be apart of it.\" \nThe Rhinos host games at the Kaliseum this Friday and Saturday. The Hounds host their home opener 7pm Friday night at Centre Ice Arena.
