Those are the guys I want to recruit and those are the guys I wanted to surround myself with. He is tough. He's physical. He's unselfish. He's everything that a great football player stands for in my mind and he's a freshman. And that excites the hell out of me.\"\nNall turned in the best performance of his young career (20 carries for 122 yards and one touchdown). It was one of the Beavers' top individual outings in the midst of a rebuilding season in which the coaching staff gave each player a shirt that read, \"Respect the Process.\"\nPerhaps no player has embodied that mantra during the new staff's short tenure more than Nall, affectionately dubbed \"Wrecking Nall\" on social media during the game.\n The 6-foot-2, 255-pound bulldozer expected to come into the season competing for time at tight end or H-back. As a senior in 2013 at Portland's Central Catholic High School, his work at running back earned him Class 6A offensive player of the year honors.\nSo when the Oregon State running back corps dealt with injuries during training camp, Nall adapted and moved back to his familiar position.\nHis career game was slow to emerge Saturday night. He scored from one yard out on his first carry to put the Beavers up 7-3 in the first quarter, but was stuffed for no gain on fourth and one in the second quarter.\nNall had eight carries for 40 yards in the first half, already career highs as he shared the rushing load with Chris Brown (4 for 33) and mobile quarterback Seth Collins (4 for 44).\nThen the freshman found his groove during the Beavers' second drive of the third quarter, which he opened with consecutive runs of nine and 20 yards to put the Beavers into Colorado territory. When the offense went a different direction on its next three plays, Oregon State was forced to punt.\nOregon State football: Gary Andersen after Beavers' 17-13 loss to Colorado Oregon State head coach Gary Andersen discusses the Beavers' fourth straight loss, the quarterback situation and the play of running back Ryan Nall.\n\"Definitely as the game progressed I started to get my mojo a little bit,\" Nall said. \"As I continued to get carries, I felt I read the holes correctly.\"\nNall tallied 82 yards on 12 carries in the second half, busting through Colorado tacklers like he was back in high school.\nEarning significant playing time felt closer to reality as the week progressed, Nall said. He continued to get more reps in practice while senior starter Storm Barrs-Woods was limited during the week while dealing with an undisclosed injury.\nOpportunities became even more readily available Saturday as the team's other running backs were picked off by injuries one by one.\nBrown, who finished with five carries for 42 yards, left the game in the fourth quarter. Barrs-Woods suited up but took one carry for one yard and was not available for the rest of the game. Damien Haskins had one carry for zero yards and left with a hamstring injury.\nThese ailments came on top of a season-ending injury three weeks ago to true freshman Deltron Sands, who once preceded Nall on the depth chart.\nOregon State's fourth consecutive loss dropped the Beavers to 0-4 in the Pac-12. The defeat came against the only other team in the conference without a win in league play, a Colorado squad that had not won a Pac-12 game in its last 14 attempts.\nAndersen said he did not expect the loss to demoralize his team. In making that assessment, he credited a group of \"young bucks\" who continued to emerge while entrenched in a season littered with valleys.\nThose players were led by Nall on Saturday, leading the hyper-focused Andersen to shine a light toward the future.\n\"There's an exciting youth movement taking place that I really like and it's fun to watch,\" he said. \"I'm proud of that kid.\n\"Get you 30-40 of those kids, you'll be rolling.\"\n-- Danny Moran\ndmoran@oregonian.com\n@DannyJMoran", "external_links":
