(Photo: Courtesy of Eric LeGrand) 108 CONNECT 30 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIt took Secret Service threats for Eric LeGrand to finally take no for an answer. \nAnd even then LeGrand worked out a compromise. \nThe former Rutgers football star, who is now the face of spinal cord injury research and awareness, was at the White House with his mother and Christopher Reeve Foundation CEO Peter Wilderotter to meet with a senior adviser to President Barack Obama in July 2013. \nThe purpose of the meeting was to discuss the foundation’s resource center, the need for more research funding and early progress in epidural stimulation, a burgeoning project called The Big Idea. \n“All of a sudden Eric says, ‘I’m going to go see him,’ and he starts wheeling down the driveway,” Wilderotter said. “The secret service are like, ‘Eric, you’ve got to stop.’ He’s like, ‘No, I’m going to see ‘O.’ ’ I said, ‘They’re going to shoot you. They’ve got snipers on the roof.’ ” \nThat warning only kind of worked, because LeGrand decided he wanted his picture taken and convinced enough people to turn their heads so he could get the snapshot with the cool backdrop. \n“He bargained,” Wilderotter said. “And that’s Eric.” Eric LeGrand fulfilling 'purpose' as fundraiser tops $105K total \nFive years ago Friday, LeGrand, a Colonia High School product, suffered a paralyzing injury while making a tackle in a Rutgers football game against Army. \nIn the spirit of his inspirational message, the former No. 52 is celebrating the five-year anniversary by launching a campaign to raise $52,000 for his foundation. Texting “LeGrand” to 20222 will initiate a $5 donation to Team LeGrand that will be added to your next cellphone bill. \n“I’m celebrating all the things that have happened since this injury,” LeGrand said. “How I’ve been able to persevere and help other people, build a foundation, build a career for myself, finish school.” \nThe initial prognosis from doctors was that LeGrand likely would need a ventilator to breathe for the rest of his life and would never eat solid food again. \nFive years later, LeGrand is an active spokesperson who has won an ESPY and graced the cover of Sports Illustrated for Moment of the Year. In private, he is fiercely dedicated to rehabilitation, having regained full range of motion in his neck, shoulder movement and twitches in his fingers. Eric LeGrand to host Mission Possible show \n“There are so many memories that go through my mind thinking back to that day, at the game, in the locker room after the game, all the unknowns,” said Rutgers coach Kyle Flood, who was on the sideline as an assistant coach to Greg Schiano at the time. \n“Going to see him early on in the process and hearing what some of the predictions were, and then watching how quickly he was able to overcome them, I think it became very evident to me right away that he was going to be able to overcome this. And he’s done a phenomenal job.” \nLeGrand co-hosts the weekly “Kyle Flood Show” on radio and is a color commentator for home game broadcasts on the Rutgers Football Radio Network. His No. 52 is the only one retired in program history. \n“That day in the stadium when we retired his number,” Flood said, “will be a day and a moment that I’ll always remember.” Eric LeGrand a pop singer? 'Believe' it \nWilderotter knew the Reeve Foundation had its next difference-maker when LeGrand showed up for their first meeting and could not stop talking about wanting to help those he had met through therapy who were less fortunate than he. \nIt’s been reaffirmed countless times through LeGrand’s push to promote The Big Idea — the $15 million fundraising campaign to perform epidural stimulation on 36 patients — including last year when Wilderotter spoke to students at his alma mater, St. Benedict’s Prep in Jersey City. \n“I asked, ‘How many people in this room have heard of Christopher Reeve?’ I’d say 10-15 percent of the hands went up,” Wilderotter said. “Then I asked, ‘How many here have heard of Eric LeGrand?’ Every hand. People just know him. They want to touch him.” \nLeGrand was quick to befriend Mikey Nichols, a Monroe High School hockey player who was paralyzed in January 2014. He's done the same for many others suddenly adjusting to a new reality. \n“He saw what we were doing, and he took it to another level,” Wilderotter said. “I can’t describe what it’s meant. In a lot of instances, people know our brand, but they don’t know what we do. \n“Our mantra is ‘Today’s care. Tomorrow’s cure.’ Chris’ brand was synonymous with ‘tomorrow’s cure,’ but Eric has brought the ‘today’s care’ aspect.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 108 CONNECT 30 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1Lw6H5r TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:23:39.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
