Los Angeles (83-76) is a game behind the Astros and tied with Minnesota, which beat Cleveland 4-2. \nHolland (4-3) allowed three hits and three runs in 6 1-3 innings for his first win since Sept. 5. \nLAMAR-SE LOUISIANA \nSutton scores late TD; SE Louisiana beats Lamar 30-27 \nHAMMOND, La. (AP) - Kody Sutton had a 1-yard touchdown run on fourth down with 1:19 remaining to help Southeastern Louisiana beat Lamar 30-27 on Thursday night. \nSutton's go-ahead score came at the end of a 17-play, 79-yard drive, which included two fourth-down conversions. Lamar turned it over on downs on its final possession. \nD'Shaie Landor threw for 283 yards and one touchdown, and ran for two scores for Southeastern Louisiana (3-1, 2-0 Southland). \nSoutheastern Louisiana had a 13-0 lead but Lamar scored 17 unanswered points. \nRodney Randle returned a kickoff 87 yards to give Lamar a 24-16 lead. But Xavier Roberson returned the ensuing kickoff 59 yards and Landor capped the short drive with a 5-yard touchdown run to pull to 24-23 at the end of the third quarter. \nKade Harrington ran for 152 yards and one touchdown for Lamar (2-2, 1-1). Reggie Begelton had 95 yards receiving to become Lamar's all-time leading receiver. \nALABAMA ST-TEXAS SOUTHERN \nRichardson, Alabama State beat Texas Southern 41-23 \nHOUSTON (AP) - Ellis Richardson threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score to lead Alabama State to a 41-23 victory over Texas Southern on Thursday night. \nTexas Southern took a 23-20 lead late in the third quarter when Averion Hurts found Derrick Griffin in the back of the end zone for a 10-yard touchdown.

Michael came in a trade with Seattle three weeks ago. \nRandle had 85 yards on his first three carries, but just 2 on his final 11 runs last weekend against Atlanta. Dallas couldn't hold a two-touchdown lead in a 39-28 loss. \nT25-TCU-PLAYERS REINSTATED \nTCU players back after missing 3 games following arrests \nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - TCU senior defensive end Mike Tuaua and freshman receiver Andre Petties-Wilson have been reinstated and will be eligible to play against Texas on Saturday. \nThe players were arrested last week on charges of robbery-bodily injury after another TCU student told Fort Worth police investigators that the players stole a case of beer while attacking him and his friends. \nThe incident happened Sept. 4, a day after the fourth-ranked Horned Frogs beat Minnesota in their season opener. Tuaua and Petties-Wilson played against the Golden Gophers but missed the past three games. \nCoach Gary Patterson said the players had \"gone through the judicial process,\" although a Fort Worth police spokesman said the case hasn't been forwarded to Tarrant County prosecutors. \nTuaua played all 12 games with five starts last season. \nFALCONS-JONES INJURY \nFalcons' Julio Jones 'good to go' despite new toe injury \nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) - Falcons coach Dan Quinn says he expects receiver Julio Jones will be \"ready to rock\" on Sunday against the Houston Texans despite a new toe injury. \nJones participated in Thursday's practice after being held out Wednesday. He also was held out of the Wednesday practice before last week's game at Dallas to rest a sore hamstring. This week he is on the injury report with toe and hamstring injuries. \nJones said Thursday, \"I'm good to go.\" \nQuinn says he does not know when Jones hurt his toe. He says it is on top of Jones' foot and is not a turf toe injury. \nJones' 34 catches are the most in NFL history through three games. He also leads the league with 440 yards receiving.
