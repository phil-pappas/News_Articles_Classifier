FLORHAM PARK – A year ago, Darrelle Revis was facing Tom Brady in practice.\nBut once again, it will be for real Sunday when Revis and Brady are on opposite sides of the line of scrimmage when the Jets (4-1) visit unbeaten New England (5-0).\nBuy this photo Revis, who is in his second tour of duty with the Jets, has played in Foxboro, Mass., many times. But this will be his first time there as an ex-Patriot.\n\"I don’t think I’ll be welcomed back with open arms, I can tell you that,\" Revis said Wednesday. \"They’re fans and they love the Patriots, and I’m not in that color jersey. We’ll see how it goes. It’ll be fun.\"\nRevis signed a one-year deal with New England in March 2014, and helped the Patriots to their first Super Bowl victory in 10 years. But his contract carried a $20 million club option for 2015, and Revis knew the Pats wouldn’t pick it up.\n\"The number was too high,\" said Revis, who signed a five-year, $70 million contract with $39 million in guaranteed money to return to the Jets.\n\"This is where I feel most comfortable at; it’s home to me,\" said Revis, who was a first-round draft pick of the Jets in 2007. \"And going back up there and playing in New England, it’ll be fun.\"\nOf course, it remains to be seen who’ll have more fun Sunday, Revis or Brady.\n\"There was a lot of competition in practice last year with him and he makes it tough,\" Brady told reporters Wednesday in Foxboro. \"He’s one of those guys who sees everything on the field. He sees the formations and routes and splits and anything pre-snap that can help him get an idea of whether the ball is coming his way, or if it’s going the other, or if it’s a run or pass, or deep throw or short throw.\n\"I got a firsthand look at that last year every day in practice,\" Brady said, \"and it was great to have him play a part here, but he moved on, so now he’s our competition again.\"\nAnd Revis acknowledged he gleaned plenty of things about Brady and the Patriots during his one season with them.\n\"I’ve got my notes,\" Revis said with a smile.\nGiven the knowledge each one now has about the other, does Revis think Brady will try to test him Sunday? Yes, if he thinks he has the advantage.\n\"Tom is a competitor,\" Revis said. \"Being his teammate last year, even before that going against him, [I know] he’s always going to look for the best matchup, and he trusts in his guys.\"\nRevis doesn’t think it will be strange going back to New England as an ex-Patriot.\n\"No, I can have a pink jersey on; it doesn’t matter,\" said Revis, who was with Tampa Bay in 2013 after being traded from the Jets. \"I’ve had three different color jerseys on. At this point in my career, it’s about just loving the game and playing.\"\nRevis won’t forget the experience of getting his first Super Bowl ring with the Patriots, but it’s not on his mind right now.\n\"It’s a memory that I will never forget,\" he said. \"We had a great team. It’s 2015 now and I’m here, so all of that is behind me at this point. But like I said, when I’m sitting down somewhere, when I’m done, that’s a memory I can always cherish.\"\nEmail: pelzman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:59:17.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
