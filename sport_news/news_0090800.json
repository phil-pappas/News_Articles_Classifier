Photo: 2010 AFP Image 14 of 14 Popovich pulls in LaMarcus Aldridge, and it’s a start 1 / 14 Back to Gallery The names over the lockers in the AT&T Center seem to be in no particular order. They stretch along three walls without concern for seniority or friendship or the alphabet.\nBut, as it often is with Gregg Popovich , nothing happens by accident.\nOne Spur dresses next to another Spur because Popovich thinks they should, and some motives are basic. Avoiding cliques would be one.\nOther reasons are personal. Tim Duncan continues to locker in the same corner where he’s been for a dozen years, even after the arena redesign, because he’s always been there and he likes it there.\nBut Popovich also weighs the dynamic of how one personality affects another. There’s no telling how he evaluated all the variables, or why he assigned this particular spot, so his reason for his placement of LaMarcus Aldridge is unclear.\nIt’s this: Center, prominent, between Tony Parker and Patty Mills .\nMaybe Popovich wanted Aldridge in the middle of everything. Maybe he wanted him between his point guards.\nMaybe he wanted the outgoing and upbeat Mills, who played with Aldridge in Portland, close by. Or maybe, too, he wanted two non-American accents to remind Aldridge this locker room is unlike any other.\nBut whatever the thinking, this seemingly small decision is just part of a project that is both intriguing and essential to the success of the Spurs.\nEven in May and June, after all, Popovich will still be judged on how he incorporates Aldridge.\nPopovich comes across to his staff as ready for this. He’s fitter than he was at this time last year, and better health has translated to a more positive approach. They say he’s easier to talk to.\nWinning the summer helped Popovich’s outlook, but winning the spring will be something else entirely. Signing Aldridge doesn’t guarantee the Spurs a championship, but it gives the Spurs two things.\nA chance — and an extension of their relevancy.\nThe latter should not be overlooked. LaMarcus Nurae Aldridge, for example, was born in July of 1985. Just two years later, when he was running around as a toddler, the Spurs were winning the David Robinson lottery and beginning a run that still hasn’t ended.\nAldridge, growing up in North Texas, said he didn’t notice. He didn’t pick up a basketball until he was in the fourth grade, and he didn’t follow the sport.\nHe was aware of Michael Jordan , but only because everyone was. If Aldridge grew to be a fan of any sports team, it was the Dallas Cowboys .\nBasketball came to him late. And all the time he was growing, and he was discovering his remarkable gifts, the Spurs kept winning.\nOther franchises have won more championships. But none have had this kind of consistent success, over the span of four decades, which is where Aldridge already fits in. His arrival promises to continue that.\nThe Spurs’ history affected Aldridge’s decision last summer. He always idolized Duncan, and he saw firsthand in the 2014 playoffs how Popovich’s system could impact a series.\nStill, there have been times when Aldridge sounds as if he isn’t sure why he chose the Spurs. He says he’s never been a person comfortable with change.\nHis second choice fit more with what Aldridge had been in Portland. The Phoenix Suns would have been contenders with him, but Aldridge would have been the star again, separated by his talent. That’s a reason he became a loner in Portland, often isolated from those he lockered next to.\nIn choosing the Spurs, Aldridge submitted to something else entirely. For those who are open to amateur psychology, perhaps this is what happened: Aldridge understood he needed to change and go against his nature.\nEnter Popovich, ever trying to figure out the complex maze of human emotions. If he’s excited about drawing up X’s and O’s for Aldridge, he’s obsessed working toward the larger goal — assimilating Aldridge into his mix.\nPopovich already had a few things on his side, namely Duncan, Manu Ginobili and a culture of winning. The Spurs have long known how to get along, and a moment this fall on the road showed that.\nOthers have wondered if Aldridge would ever follow Popovich’s let’s-eat-as-a-team lead. But there was Boris Diaw after a preseason game in Miami, going around the locker room, seeing who wanted to go out for dinner together.\nWithout hesitation, Aldridge said yes.\nPopovich was given another tool with an annual preseason activity. When H-E-B asked to include Aldridge in its commercials, it was a natural way for Aldridge to hang with Duncan, Ginobili and Mills and feel like one of the guys.\nPopovich has found ways in practice, too. He has consistently paired Duncan with Aldridge, keeping them together as a unit, when Popovich usually likes to mix and match.\nAssistants have noticed and aren’t sure why. Maybe it’s to create familiarity. Or maybe it’s a way for Popovich to announce Aldridge’s status, to tell Aldridge, too, he and Duncan are in this together.\nAs it is with the assigned locker stalls, the reasoning is uncertain but the message is consistent. Popovich is pulling in Aldridge, getting him to invest in the group — because that’s how the Spurs have won before.\nbharvey@express-news.net\nTwitter: Buck_SA", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/63/8277203/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/42/71/8269415/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276969/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/42/71/8269423/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276983/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843124/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.nba.com/blazers/chat/aldridge_transcript_112906.html", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/32/62/8236211/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276970/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/16/14/35/3721047/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276969/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.nba.com/blazers/news/LaMarcus_Aldridge_Ridinrsquo-198466-1218.html", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/16/14/35/3721047/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400579037", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/11/8286820/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276966/3/920x920.jpg", "https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843124/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276975/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/63/8277203/4/920x920.jpg", "http://www.nba.com/blazers/lamarcus-aldridge-becomes-portlands-second-all-time-leading-scorer", "http://www.nba.com/blazers/news/lamarcus-aldridge-named-nba-western-conference-player-week-0", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276983/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276966/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/42/71/8269423/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276975/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/42/71/8269417/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/11/8286820/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/57/8276970/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/42/71/8269417/3/920x920.jpg", "http://blog.oregonlive.com/behindblazersbeat/2009/01/a_changed_aldridge.html", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/42/71/8269415/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/32/62/8236211/15/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:49:22.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
