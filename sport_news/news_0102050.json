People didn’t ask for another World Series, or even a division title; if they did, they were dreaming of something that felt too far, somewhere beyond the visible horizon. No, people would say: Games that matter. Just give us those again, please.\nSunday night, in the cooling Texas evening, the Toronto Blue Jays did that. Oh, did they. Facing a game that could end their season, the Jays rediscovered themselves. Troy Tulowitzki, the patient zero of this team’s second-half hurricane, put fuse to dynamite: a two-out, three-run home run in the sixth inning. Before that, the Jays were squandering chances for three straight innings and nearly four, getting two runs when it should have been five or six or eight. It felt like encroaching doom. When Tulowitzki drove that ball into the left-field stands, Toronto could breathe.\n“It’s a relief,” said designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion, after a 5-1 win over the Texas Rangers in Game 3. “But we’ve got two more games to go.”\n“We definitely feel like we’re the better team,” said catcher Russell Martin, who sat in favour of Dioner Navarro, who is starter Marco Estrada’s preferred catcher. “It doesn’t mean the better team always wins, but we definitely feel good now about going into tomorrow.”\nThis game mattered, boy. Lose, and this insane, guffawing, summer-storm-out-of-a-clear-blue-sky season, this absurdity, would have been over. It happened so fast, all of it: the trades at the end of July, the rolling party in August and September, the champagne celebrations, and then, suddenly: two losses, and the edge of elimination .\nBut Estrada pitched a gem, and the Blue Jays looked a little more like the team that was heavily favoured to win this best-of-five playoff series.\n“The thing that’s different (about the playoffs) is the finality, you know,” said R.A. Dickey, the start scheduled to pitch Game 4. “Before, there wasn’t that sense of finality, right, and here we are . . . it feels like the last two games, even from the first game, there’s this kind of presence of ‘the end is near,’ if you, you know, you don’t watch it. That’s what’s felt different too, is just kind of that lingering sense of finality: to think that you really potentially only have 17 games left, right?”\nSeventeen games, or fewer. But Monday, at least one more.\nIt felt like this anxiety had arrived so fast, but it has been a culmination, the day after day of baseball. Look at Kevin Pillar, for instance. He points to the wall-climbing catch he made on April 15 against Tampa, and what it did.\n“In some small way, that catch changed my life,” said Pillar. “I mean, I was a fairly unknown guy in this league, and you make a catch like that and you see yourself on SportsCenter , MLB Network, people talk about it. You’re not just a guy that’s on a team. People know who you are. People still to this day, when I’m walking the streets, remind me of that catch. It kind of put me on the map, in some small way.\n“For that to happen that early in the year, for a guy who wasn’t expected to be in the lineup every day, I think it really gave me the confidence to know that I was able to be an everyday player, that I was worthy of being out there ... If you’re not going to believe in yourself, who’s going to believe in you?”\nThat was the story of these Jays, from day one. Pillar wasn’t the star of this team, of course; he was a piece. Just like Estrada was a piece, quietly acquired. Just like Tulowitzki was a piece, and the one who lit the season-long fuse. Tulowitzki didn’t hit as a Jay, but the rest of the team did. In Game 3 that dynamic flipped, and just in time. Afterwards, Tulowitzki sat at the podium, his left shoulder still wrapped in ice and electrodes, and you could see the electricity pulse into his body, now and then. His cracked shoulder blade is healed enough, but he’s not quite himself. Like the Jays, he was close enough to himself to get one more chance.\nMaybe this game made you spend your Sunday pacing back and forth. It might have made you want go for a walk, or have a drink. The prospect of this season ending might have made your guts churn all day, and made your stomach an ocean.\nBut that’s what Toronto had been waiting for, whether it knew it or not. Baseball is slow, until it happens so fast. Game 4 is Monday, and the Jays will try to breathe again.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays’ John Gibbons shrugs off critics: DiManno\nFive key moments of Blue Jays’ ALDS Game 3 win", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:58:23.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
