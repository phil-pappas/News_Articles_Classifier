Mike Condon made 34 saves, and P.K. Subban and Tomas Plekanec each had three assists. \nMatt Moulson and Ryan O'Reilly scored for Buffalo, and Cody Franson had two assists. Chad Johnson allowed all seven goals. \nMontreal won for first time in four tries against Buffalo dating to Nov. 28, 2014. \nMontreal opened the scoring with 5:25 left in the first period. Subban and Weise worked a 2-on-1 against Jake McCabe that ended with Weise's one-timer past Johnson. \nJack Eichel nearly tied it with a minute left in the first, when he wheeled across the blue line and traced the left circle before being stifled by Condon. \nJohnson gave up a soft goal 45 seconds into the second, leaving the post open on a rebound after spilling Gallagher's backhander back to the shooter. \nThe Sabres got on the board off a no-look backhand pass from Sam Reinhart. He was gliding past the goal line when he dropped the puck to Moulson for a hard snap shot past Condon. \nBuffalo tied it 6 minutes later, with Franson navigating a diving shot-blocker and sliding the puck to O'Reilly for a one-timer that beat Condon low. \nMontreal reclaimed the lead when Mitchell, a former Buffalo player, redirected Subban's slap shot past Johnson with 6:29 left in the second. Markov needed 3 seconds of Montreal's first power play to send a slap shot from the point past Johnson to make it 4-2 with 1:38 left in the period. \nGallagher added a power-play goal off a rebound 27 seconds into the third. Pacioretty picked up his goal on a low shot from the slot midway through the period, and Weise deflected Markov's point shot home to complete the scoring with 4:37 left. \nNOTES: Jimmy Roberts, a five-time Stanley Cup winner as player for Montreal and a former Sabres head coach and assistant, died Friday. He was 75. .... Buffalo recalled goalie Linus Ullmark from Rochester of the American Hockey League before the game, and sent down goalie Nathan Lieuwen. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:12:45.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
