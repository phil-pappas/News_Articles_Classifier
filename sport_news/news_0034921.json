Founded in 2010 by a core group of five members - Johnny Murphy, Gareth Owen, Oli Myhill, Sean Hennessey and Lee Ebbutt - the club has a mix of players from different nationalities. \nLee Ebutt \n“For us, football is fun and family. It is integral to our lives and the common bond among the members is the passion for the game,” said Ebbutt, Muscat Storm's team manager. \n“We founded the club with an objective to have members come to the ground and play non-professional but a decent standard of football. With most of the players hailing from Europe, we have our own style of play that is different from that of the local Omani teams. We play an organised game of football,” said Ebbutt. \nA former player with Birmingham City in the UK, Ebbutt now aims to expand the club's horizons by playing more matches and increasing the membership fold. \n“The club membership is open for all expatriates who love to play football. That is the most important requirement. We hope to play a total of 28 matches in the ongoing season,” said Ebbutt. \n“Over the past five years, we have grown in structure and strengthened the quality of the team. We now play against good Omani teams and we also make it a point to play against the visiting British naval teams. \n“The Omani teams love playing against us as we provide them a different challenge as compared to the other Omani clubs, who adopt the same style of play. Our team comprises a couple of players who have played good club football in the their respective countries,” he said. \nEbbutt said the club hopes to be part of a Gulf non-professional football league in future that will bring teams from the neighbouring nations to Oman, while Storm could also travel to play away games. \n“It will be how the Muscat Rugby Football Club in Oman plays in the Gulf Premiership League. We are in talks with a few teams in Dubai. We do go to Dubai once in the season and also host them, but we need to have a permanent structure.” \nThe club has also been involved with a couple of international schools in Muscat. Kids from The Sultan's School, British School Muscat, Muscat International School, The American International School Muscat and American British Academy have had a chance to play against Muscat Storm or have played with the side. \n“The Muscat Community Football League (MCFL) is another good platform for expat kids in Muscat and we would like to have a system where the kids, once they finish school or have taken part in the MCFL, can look forward to join Muscat Storm,” said Ebbutt. \n“Our vision is to someday have a clubhouse and a home ground. It is a long-term plan and we are hopeful that Storm will have a permanent place in Oman,” he said. \n“At present, our home ground is The Sultan's School and we are thankful to the school and our main supporter Grand Hyatt.” \n“For Storm's members, football is a way of life. We wanted to have a place where the passion for the game could be translated on the field. It's like continuing our love affair with the game,” said Ebbutt. \nAs Muscat Storm's journey continues, its members hope to leave an indelible mark on Oman's football canvas.
