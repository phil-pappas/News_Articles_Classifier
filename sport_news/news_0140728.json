Afternoon temperatures climbed into the 80s and some areas in central South Dakota reached the 90 degree mark. On top of the above average temperatures, skies were clear all day today. \nOvernight lows tonight will range in the low to middle 50s with clear skies. \nTomorrow will be a repeat of today with the sunshine and clear skies and 80s for highs. However, cooler air will start to descend into the Midwest; bringing temperatures back down to the 60s and 70s for next week but the biggest change tomorrow will be the winds. Sunday afternoon, the sustained winds will speed up to the 20s and 30s with gusts in the 30s and 40s when the front passes. \nNext week is expected to be dry and sunny with highs in the 60s and 70s with lows in the 40s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:52:16.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
