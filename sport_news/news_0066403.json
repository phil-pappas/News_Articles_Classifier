I think affordable housing is a much better choice for that lot.\"\nMurray has said he is willing to spend the rest of Sisley's fines to \"provide assistance to tenants and manage nuisance properties that are a safety concern,\" the release stated. \"We are also working closely with developers to ensure that additional affordable housing is part of a revitalized neighborhood.‚Äù\nIf the park is part of that revitalization as a spot for families to come together, Parker is left with questions:\n\"I think the question again is whose families? Which families can afford to live here?\"\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
