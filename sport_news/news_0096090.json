Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: Is the Cowboys' inability to force turnovers partly due to them playing more man coverage? I think they are playing more cover 1 than cover 3 this year, and that makes them more succeptible to pick plays and less likely to pick passes off with their backs turned to the QB. What says the man who actually played in the NFL?\nBabe Laufenberg: No doubt you usually see more interceptions in zone coverage. The defenders all have their eyes facing the QB and the ball. And the Cowboys have been playing a lot of man-to-man. As a matter of fact, I hope I never hear \"Tampa 2\" associated with this defense because they just don't play it. But the lack of takeaways is absolutely mind-boggling. Play five games and only take the ball away in one of those? Not good. And here is more bad news - the Giants are tied for first in turnover differential (please don't say turnover \"ratio\") at plus 6. The Cowboys are tied for 27th at minus 5. Not good.\nQuestion: How would you rate first-round rookie cornerback/safety Byron Jones' play so far this season? If you had that selection to do over again, would you pick him or look elsewhere?\nBabe Laufenberg: I think he has played well. Still hasn't been given the full dose, but thought he really matched up well with Gronk, or as good as anyone can matchup with that beast of a man! Need a bigger sample size, but so far, so good. But as a first-round pick, you didn't draft him to be your nickel defender. So eager to see him get out to corner and see how he performs against the best, play after play. You have to like his physical traits and his intelligence, and that combination is usually a good recipe for success.\nQuestion: Cole Beasley talked about all the double coverage he saw against NE. Do you think he's the top target right now with Dez out? Belichick sure seems to think so.\nBabe Laufenberg: New England's game plan was simple...you may beat us, but you won't beat us with Witten or Beasley. They forced the Cowboys to throw the football outside, and when they couldn't...game over.\nQuestion: What signs of improvement are you looking for from the Cowboys after the bye week?\nBabe Laufenberg: The bye week can be a \"Back To The Basics\" type week and that would be the running game. If the Cowboys can't run the ball better than they have, Matt Cassel will look no different than Brandon Weeden.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nSherrington: Kool-Aid drinker Jerry Jones hasn't learned important football lesson\nBob Sturm: Examining the 2016 NFL draft from the Cowboys' perspective\nSabin: Dez not being counted out, but several factors make return vs. NYG unlikely for Cowboys star WR\nLaufenberg: Is Michael the answer?
