Jonathan Bernier. \nWhile Maple Leafs head coach Mike Babcock doesn't like the drama of waiting a day or so to name a starting goalie for upcoming games, the inconsistency of Bernier and to a lesser degree, James Reimer, led to a delay in picking the starter for the game in Buffalo on Wednesday. \nBernier has struggled with early goals juxtaposed with strong finishes in three games so far. Babcock could have gone with Reimer on Wednesday and set Saturday's table for Bernier in one of his favourite rinks, the home-province Bell Centre in Montreal. \nThen again, maybe the Sabres assignment was made to get Bernier hungry to earn consecutive starts and restore the mental edge that has been missing of late. \nThe goal-challenged Sabres would give Bernier a shot at his first win of the season. \n\"That's the beauty of having a few days,\" Babcock said of the schedule granting him a break from back-to-back games this week. \"You take the time, you make the decision you like. I obviously watched the video, talk to your coaches, look at the plan, at the saves, at what (both) have done, at scoring chances against, what the two goalies have done and you go from there.\" \nBabcock couldn't hide his frustration that neither stopper has separated himself more than a month after camp started and five games are in the books, four of them losses. That was rarely an issue in his 10 years with the Red Wings. \n\"I mentioned that to Steve (Briere, the goalie coach) and Bernie, I don't like coming in here every day and deciding who is playing. There shouldn't even be any questions, you should know who is playing all the time. \n\"Bernie has a skill set. (But) he's obviously tight at the start of games and has to get that looked after.\" \nLIFETIME FRIENDSHIP \nWednesday is new general manager Lou Lamoriello's 73rd birthday. He shares a history with 90-year-old Leafs goalie Johnny Bower. \nWhen Lamoriello was a toddler in Providence R.I., Bower played pro there with the AHL Reds before his NHL career began. Lamoriello's parents, who owned fishing boats, made friends with Bower, among many players. At one point, Bower and his wife Nancy boarded with Lamoriello's parents and Bower told author Bob Duff he recalled a happy Lou Lamoriello getting pony rides in the back yard. \nLamoriello eventually became the Providence stick boy, launching his hockey career. \nCROSSING SWORDS \nDefenceman Morgan Rielly anticipates a renewed Leafs' rivalry with the Buffalo Sabres, who have No. 2 overall pick Jack Eichel and the same designs on moving up in the Atlantic Division. The teams finished seventh and eighth in the division last season, but better years are forecast. \n\"Jack is a great player, extremely talented and has a very bright future,\" the 21-year-old Rielly said. \"I'm looking forward to seeing how he grows as a player and where it takes him. \n\"They're a good young team with some new players, and we are too. We play them a lot, so I'm sure there might be some heated moments as it builds. As it always is.\" \nLEO IN LINE \nBabcock on Leo Komarov's surprise promotion to first line right wing. \n\"He's been real good, heavy on the puck. He competes really hard and he gets it back. He can take more time in the scoring areas, which I think he will, I think he has been a very important guy for us, one of our better guys.\" Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:08:39.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
