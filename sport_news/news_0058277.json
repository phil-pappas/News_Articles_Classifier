The man simply knows how to get paid.\nAnd not just by beast-moding on the field. He’s cut ads for candy, insurance companies and local plumbers. He’s got his own clothing line and energy drink. He even made a movie about himself. Pretty damn good for a 29-year-old with a reputation for reticence.\nLynch’s latest foray into commercial acting is in an XBox commercial that shows he’s pretty much the ideal Madden opponent—a talented shit talker and skilled player who wears a complete football uniform to play the game and brings along rodents to distract opponents. Add in his penchant for keeping snacks in his tube socks , and Lynch is pretty much the ideal dude.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSaBDtpts4c"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:37:18.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
