(Photo courtesy Penn State Athletics) Mark Wogenrich Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Penn State's Beaver Stadium getting new turf for the first time in a decade. \nPenn State's Beaver Stadium could be renovated, or even replaced , at some point. In the meantime, the field of the world's third-largest stadium is getting a necessary makeover. \nPenn State is replacing the sod at Beaver Stadium , which has served as the Nittany Lions' playing surface for a decade. But five consecutive home games, three of which were played in the rain, prompted a re-sodding of the field considered among the best in the country. \n\"The age of our playing surface, the intense nature of five straight football games, the weather we endured, and the high standard we hold ourselves to combined to bring about this decision in order to continue providing the most stable playing surface possible.\" Herb Combs, Penn State's athletic field supervisor, said in a statement. \"The new sod will be better than the previous playing surface for the next two games and into 2016.\" \nThe four-day replacement project began Tuesday, and the field is expected to be at its peak for Penn State's next home game against Illinois on Oct. 31. \nBeaver Stadium's turf has been replaced rarely over the past four decades: the last time was prior to Penn State's 2005 game against Ohio State. \nAccording to Penn State, about 70,000 square feet of sod will be used at Beaver Stadium and its on-campus nursery. The Kentucky bluegrass came from a New Jersey turf farm. \n\"It's going to be like one magic carpet, in the sense that it is going to knit together and it's going to be stable,\" Combs said. \"And it will provide the same surface everyone is accustomed to seeing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:33:29.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
