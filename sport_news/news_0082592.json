(Brian Cassella) Dom Amore Contact Reporter Up 2-0, it's on to Wrigley for Mets \nNEW YORK — What happens to players and teams in October remains baseball's great mystery. When a team plays as if it has caught a breeze at its back, there is no point analyzing. One can only sit back and enjoy. \nThis is provided, of course, it's your team that has been uplifted, driven forward. The Mets have that wind at their backs at the moment, and it threatens to lift and carry them right into the World Series. \n\"We're having a whole bunch of fun right now,\" said Daniel Murphy, who hit his fifth homer of the postseason. \"You dream of it, being able to go to work with 24 men in there who are absolutely awesome guys.\" \nNoah Syndergaard threw 5 2/3 innings of heat, 98 mph on a 45-degree New York night, and even the Mets' weak link, the bullpen, chipped in with important outs as the Mets beat the Cubs 4-1, to take a two-zip lead in the NLCS before 44,502 at Citi Field on Sunday night. And the carpet ride moves on to Chicago. \n\"We'll take what we've got, and we're going to ride that pitching,\" manager Terry Collins said. \"The game is changing. Those power arms, everybody's got 'em, but usually they're in the bullpen. We have guys that can maintain 95 to 98 mph for six and seven innings at a time. I'll tell you, that's tough on hitters, especially in weather like this.\" \nNow the Mets have beaten the Cubs' two best pitchers — Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta — and have their best in this postseason, Jacob deGrom, poised to pitched Game 3 at Wrigley Field against Chicago's Jason Hammel. \nDavid Wright broke a postseason drought with an RBI double in the first inning, and Murphy followed with a nine-iron shot, just inside the right field foul pole to give the Mets a 3-0 lead against Arrieta, the first time in five years he allowed three runs in a first inning. \n\"Daniel is about as hot as anyone I've ever seen,\" Wright said. \n\"It sure makes it easier to pitch,\" Syndergaard said, \"when the offense puts up a three-spot in the first against one of the best pitchers in the game.\" \nAs hot as Murphy has been, that's how cold Wright, the Mets' captain, has been — 1-for-19 in the first six postseason games. Collins told him, \"if there's one guy around here who is not worried about it, it's me,\" and wrote his name in the lineup again. \n\"We need his presence in the lineup,\" Collins said. \"That leadership, you have to have it on the field.\" \nThe Mets scraped for one more, on Yoenis Cespedes' RBI single in the third, and spent the rest of the game holding on. Syndergaard, who arrived in the majors in May, allowed three hits, walked one and struck out nine, but he had to work too hard — 97 pitches — to go too deep into the game. Right fielder Curtis Granderson's homer-robbing catch in the second inning helped keep Chicago scoreless, and finally Syndergaard and his flowing blond mop took their leave with two out in the sixth, after Kris Bryant's RBI double, and Collins pieced the rest of the game together. \n\"That ambush early got us,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"But you've got to give a lot of credit to their young pitcher. That's elite velocity, and he's a little more polished than when we first saw him [in Syndergaard's debut].\" \nJonathan Niese, erstwhile starter, came on to get slugger Anthony Rizzo, who had been only 2 for 17 against him, to end the sixth. Then late-season acquisitions Addison Reed and Tyler Clippard, both of whom had been shaky of late, held the lead to the ninth when rock-solid Jeurys Familia came on to get his second save in two nights, fourth in the postseason. \n\"Those guys walk through those clubhouse doors, they hand their egos on the coat rack,\" Collins said. \"They don't care who's in the game, just get it done.\" \nThe Cubs, who slugged their way to 97 regular season wins and a Division Series upset of the top-seeded Cardinals, have done little against Mets pitching in this series, a total of 10 hits, and the road gets only rougher with deGrom going Tuesday night. Chicago's quest to break all the various jinxes and win the World Series for the first time since 1908 has hit yet another serious roadblock. \n\"Listen, it's never going to be easy this time of year,\" Maddon said, \"they're very good, and we know that coming in.\" \nNo one, though, could have foreseen what Murphy has done. He's hitting .429, and has homered off Clayton Kershaw (twice), Zach Grienke, Jon Lester and now, perhaps, the best pitcher in baseball in 2015, Arrieta, who was 22-6 with a 1.77 ERA in the regular season, 2-0, 2.45 in his first two postseason starts. \n\"You rarely see someone get that hot against average pitching,\" Wright said. \nMaddon started Chris Coghlan in right field, in large part because he had homered against Syndergaard this year. It looked like a great move when Coghlan launched one toward the Mets' bullpen in the second inning, but Granderson got back to the wall and leapt, snaring the ball as it appeared headed for home run territory. Everything was going the Mets' way. \n\"That was a huge play for us,\" Syndergaard said, \"it saved a run, potentially saved what could have been a comeback for them. Being able to throw a pitch at a certain time, make a mistake and have my defense back me up was unbelievable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:44:56.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
