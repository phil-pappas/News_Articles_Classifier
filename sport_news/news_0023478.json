Andy McCullough, The Kansas City Star Print this article Advertisement KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The sturdiest collection of chins in baseball draped themselves over the dugout railing on Saturday afternoon as yet another opponent self-immolated in their presence. The Royals learned long ago how to roll with the punches, but in a 6-3 victory over Toronto in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series, the group displayed its mettle once again and corralled a commanding two-game advantage. A window cracked open when a seventh-inning fly-ball off the bat of Ben Zobrist fell between Blue Jays second baseman Ryan Goins and outfielder Jose Bautista. The Royals, when presented with an inch, make plans for taking a mile. A five-run rally followed. Before Zobrist’s single landed, Toronto ace David Price had retired 18 batters in a row. He struck out the side in the sixth. Then he fell apart. Lorenzo Cain hit a single and so did Eric Hosmer to score a run. Kendrys Morales drove Cain home from third with a ground-ball. Third-base coach Mike Jirschele made an aggressive call to send Hosmer on a single by Mike Moustakas, but Bautista botched the throw home and the game was tied. The efficiency of Price before the seventh meant his pitch count was still well below 100. So Toronto stuck with him. With two outs, Alex Gordon smashed a go-ahead double. As insurance, Alex Rios rolled an RBI single up the middle off reliever Aaron Sanchez. Up to that point, Price appeared on the brink of his first postseason victory as a starter and one of the best outings of these playoffs. As the innings progressed, the hulking exterior of the stadium cast a shadow across the diamond. The shade crept from behind the plate all the way to the outfield as Price dissected the Royals. For five innings, Yordano Ventura offered a reasonable counterweight to Price. A pair of doubles lead to a third-inning run, but otherwise Ventura kept the Blue Jays at bay. He lost his footing in the sixth. Price did the same in the seventh. “Hace frio, man!” Escobar said as he walked onto the field for batting practice. The temperature registered at 59 degrees at first pitch, a 96-mph fastball for a strike from Ventura. That was the softest four-seam fastball Ventura threw all inning. He set down the side in 12 pitches, including a strikeout of Josh Donaldson that he punctuated by flinging his leg skyward. Ventura yielded a pair of singles in the second. He recovered to strike out Troy Tulowitzki, who is nursing a cracked scapula. Tulowitzki needed to start his swing early to combat Ventura’s fastball, so he looked helpless when Ventura switched to the curveball. Escobar intervened to contain the Blue Jays. Catcher Russell Martin rifled a line drive bound for the outfield. Escobar leaped to snatch the ball out of the air. He fed Zobrist at second base for the inning-ending double play. Ventura could not find similar acrobatics behind him in the third. He committed a cardinal sin against Toronto by allowing their No. 8 and No. 9 hitters to punish him. Kevin Pillar sprayed a double into right, where the baseball rolled under the glove of Alex Rios. With slap-hitting second baseman Goins up next, Mike Moustakas edged toward the grass, protecting against a potential bunt. Instead Goins slashed an inside fastball down the line for a run-scoring double. Toronto entrusted the lead to Price. He joined the Blue Jays just ahead of the trade deadline in July, less than a week after Kansas City acquired Johnny Cueto. Price bulldozed opponents in the second half and dueled with Astros ace Dallas Keuchel for the American League Cy Young Award. Yet the Blue Jays opted for 24-year-old right-hander Marcus Stroman in a decisive Game 5 against Texas in the American League Division Series. Manager John Gibbons used Price in relief in Game 4. In 10 October innings, Price had allowed eight runs, pushing his postseason ERA to 5.04. Price did not look belabored by the postseason pressure at the start on Saturday. He gave up a leadoff single to Escobar and then proceeded to devastate the Royals. He needed 29 pitches to complete three innings. He pumped first-pitch strikes to 11 of the 13 hitters he faced through four. For Ventura, the sixth inning’s resemblance to Game 1 was close to uncanny. During a 37-pitch sixth inning on Friday, Edinson Volquez walked Donaldson and Jose Bautista, but steadied himself to strand both. A day later, Ventura gave up an infield single to Donaldson and walked Bautista. But the route to the runs was not a straight line. Before Donaldson reached base, he lofted a foul ball toward the Royals dugout. Catcher Salvador Perez tracked it down. As the ball descended, it connected with a wire stringing up the protective netting. Perez caught the ball in his bare hand, but the ball was declared dead. Soon after, Donaldson chopped a grounder toward Alcides Escobar and beat the throw. After Bautista joined Donaldson on base, Edwin Encarnacion muscled a single that bounced off Escobar’s glove. Two batters later, Tulowitzki shot an opposite-field double that evaded Rios’ glove by inches. Until the seventh, the Royals lacked recourse against Price and started to carp at umpire Laz Diaz. Gordon looked frustrated after a called third strike. Rios argued with Diaz and pointed a finger in his face after another. The team would unleash its rage on Price an inning later.
