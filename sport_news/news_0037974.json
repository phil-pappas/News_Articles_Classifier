(AP) - Kansas quarterback Montell Cozart is out with a shoulder sprain and Deondre Ford is done for the season with a thumb injury, forcing freshman Ryan Willis to start Saturday's against No. 3 Baylor.\nJayhawks coach David Beaty made the announcements Monday.\nThe Jayhawks (0-4) also lost top quarterback Michael Cummings to a season-ending knee injury during the spring game. Cozart was injured in last Saturday's loss at Iowa State, while Ford was hurt in a game at Rutgers, when Cozart was already sidelined by an illness.\nWillis filled in for Cozart on the final few series against the Cyclones, going 8 of 16 for 100 yards. Before that game, his only experience was two plays in the opener against South Dakota State.\nThe Bears (4-0) were already 42-point favorites.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
