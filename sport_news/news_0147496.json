He has passed every hurdle since the Pistons used the eighth pick of June’s NBA draft on the Arizona standout.\nHe entered the game late in the first quarter and hit his first shot. He was forced to play point guard with the Pistons missing Reggie Jackson (sore Achilles) and Steve Blake (concussion).\nHe finished the first half with 11 points, but with Spencer Dinwiddie struggling with ineffective play and foul trouble, Johnson got the start in the second half.\nHe scored 15 points and he was forced to guard red-hot Pacers standout Paul George, who finished with 32 points, 20 coming in the first quarter.\nJohnson was referring to having his pocket picked twice by Pacers backup Toney Douglas.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nObservations from Pistons' preseason opener\nBut overall a solid debut.\n“Playing against a superstar in Paul George and seeing what that’s like is always positive and just playing on the court,” Johnson said.\n“I think knowledge is power and your best teacher is experience. The more experience I get, the faster I learn, the faster I can be great.”\nKCP Excels: The few fans who showed up at the Palace were able to see Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s hard work pay off.\nThe third-year guard put on a shooting display in knocking down his first six three-pointers on his way to 22 points.\nPistons coach Stan Van Gundy said Caldwell-Pope has been the Pistons’ best player in camp and it carried over to Tuesday night.\nHe got things started with a stellar first-quarter, when he was 4-for-4 from three-point range.\nHe was 4-for-5 to score 14 points in the first quarter and even his miss showed growth.\nHe was closely guarded by a Pacers defender, but he was able to make a move and get all the way to the rim.\nHis lay-up attempt barely missed, but Andre Drummond was able to get the follow-up dunk off the offensive rebound.\nCaldwell-Pope had poor ball-handling skills when he was a rookie in the 2013-14 season and he now appears comfortable dribbling in traffic.\nSpencer Struggles: Dinwiddie got the start alongside Caldwell-Pope, Drummond, Ersan Ilyasova and Marcus Morris.\nHe was able to find Ilyasova for the first basket of the game, but the Pistons’ pick-and-roll attack was noticeably hindered.\nVan Gundy constantly harped about Dinwiddie’s performance, even calling time-out after one misstep.\nJohnson had a plus-minus of plus-8.\nDinwiddie was minus-18 and scored four points on 1-for-6 shooting. He had four assists, but three turnovers in 25 minutes.\nVan Gundy’s options were limited.\n“Spence has been OK in camp, but he just didn’t have a good game,” Van Gundy said. “He didn’t play well. He fouled a lot, missed defensive assignments, turned the ball over.\n“He made a couple of nice plays offensively, but he just didn’t have a good night.”\nBullock's Time: Van Gundy made a point of getting a look at swingman Reggie Bullock in the playing rotation.\nHe didn’t enter the game until the second half, where he got the start, but contributed nicely when he entered.\nThe Pistons are over the roster limit of 15 and Bullock, who was acquired from the Phoenix Suns in the off-season, is on the roster bubble.\nBut Tuesday was a good night for Bullock, 24.\nHe was active on defense as he got time at shooting guard.\nBut the key for Bullock is to make shots and he knocked down two three-pointers as the Pistons surged.\nInjury List: The MRI on Jackson’s Achilles was clean. Swingman Adonis Thomas (Achilles) and center Aron Baynes (ankle) also were not available.\n“Baynes went through walk-through today, but until he can get through a practice, I’m not gonna throw him into a game,” Van Gundy said.\nContact Vince Ellis at vellis@freepress.com.
