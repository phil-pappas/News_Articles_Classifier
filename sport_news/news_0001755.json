GLENN GUILBEAU, Gannett Louisiana 12:27 p.m. CDT September 30, 2015 LSU running back Leonard Fournette (7) signals to fans during Saturday's game against Syracuse. (Photo: Mike Groll/AP) \nBATON ROUGE — The hottest topic concerning sophomore sensation tailback Leonard Fournette — at least in national and NFL media circles — is the following. Why play if so good? \nSome have even suggested that since Fournette is already NFL ready, he should take next season off and get ready for the NFL Draft in 2017 since he cannot enter the draft, by rule, until after his junior year. \nLSU coach Les Miles was asked on the Southeastern Conference teleconference about balancing his desire for LSU to win with Fournette's exploding NFL potential. Fournette leads the nation with 210.3 yards a game and is the fastest back in LSU history to 600 yards in just three games, \n“There’s a quality opportunity for Leonard to get a good number of carries,” Miles said of his No. 8 Tigers (3-0, 2-0 SEC) hosting 45-point underdog Eastern Michigan (1-3, 0-1 Mid-American Conference) at 6 p.m. Saturday on ESPNU. NFL age rule forcing Fournette to risk injury, value \n“But we want to keep him fresh,” said Miles, who has been known for keeping his best back fresh for years. “We have good backs. As long as he’s playing fresh with fresh legs and hadn’t got nicked in any way, we feel like calling his number is a very positive thing to do in many instances for many reasons. But in the same vein, if he’s not, we want him out.” \nFournette, who gained 244 yards on 26 carries in a 34-24 win at Syracuse Saturday, did miss part of the fourth quarter at Syracuse after he was hit below the belt. Backup tailbacks Derrius Guice, Darrel Williams and Nick Brossette carried seven times during the game. \n“We’re going to break him with a number of very, very capable backs that we have that are in a position to take reps and practice and are ready to go,” Miles said. “So we feel like getting him through the season, getting him to the key contests, certainly this Saturday and thereafter, that allow us the opportunity for him to do the things that he’s capable of doing for our team and that he might show a prospective employer in the NFL.” Miles does not plan to mess with Fournette's run recipe \nLSU currently has the most former players in the NFL with approximately 60. Miles was asked if often has self-preservation conversations with players he has and has had at LSU whom he knows are likely headed to the NFL. \n“No, no, we’re all about this football season,” he said. “We’re all about the next opponent. We’re all about finishing where LSU wants to finish. But you never say never because there are those exceptional players that you just need to visit with sometimes about things. You want to take care of a guy like Leonard Fournette, maybe not necessarily on the field, but off the field. You want to make sure that he handles the regiment of having to speak to the press, so we cancelled some of those. We just want Leonard to go to class, go to football and enjoy a smattering of media opportunities and play ball on Saturday and have fun. Have fun with his college. I think the approach that we have for him is a quality one.” Fournette off to big lead in 1st USA Today Heisman vote \nMiles was asked about the mindset that some suddenly have concerning Fournette, such as, “Why play him against such a weak team as Eastern Michigan?” After the Syracuse game, Miles was even asked why Fournette was in the game late even though LSU won by only 10 and led by only a touchdown early in the fourth quarter. \n“The answer is this,” Miles said. “I’ve never seen a game won or decided before you arrived. If that’s the case, I just want you to know, we’ll call our starting lineup much differently. If we’re going to line up and play and decide when the clock starts with zero for them and zero for us, then we’re going to have to play and play well. And so we would invite and insist on inviting all of the best to the field.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:50:50.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
