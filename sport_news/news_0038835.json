Royals, Jays bring two series home 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Houston\nAstros shortstop Carlos Correa couldn't handle a deflected grounder that might have been a double-play ball, helping the Kansas City Royals rally for five runs in the eighth inning to beat Houston 9-6 Monday and force their playoff series to a decisive Game 5.\nCorrea homered twice, doubled, singled and drove in four runs in Game 4 of the AL Division Series. Houston took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but a tough error charged to the 21-year-old rookie keyed the Royals' comeback to even the matchup at two games apiece.\nGame 5 will be back in Kansas City on Wednesday night. Johnny Cueto is set to start for the Royals against Collin McHugh.\n\"Everyone that watched that game, everybody that was a part of that game knows how difficult it is to feel like that game was closing in our favor and then have it not go our way,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.\n\"But it's big boy sport. We'll adjust, and we will be ready to play,\" he said.\nKansas City opened the eighth with five straight singles off relievers Will Harris and Tony Sipp , with RBI hits by Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer making it 6-4 and leaving the bases loaded with no outs.\nKendrys Morales followed with a hard, one-bouncer off Sipp's glove. The ball took two more hops and got past the top of Correa's mitt, rolling into center field as two runs scored to tie it at 6.\nAlex Gordon 's RBI groundout off Luke Gregerson later in the inning put Kansas City ahead.\nHosmer launched a long, two-run homer in the ninth for insurance.\n\"We always feel that we're still in games, and we still have a chance,\" Hosmer said. \"That's the mentality for this whole entire team. It's never quit, and the character we showed today. That's what a championship ballclub does.\"\nRyan Madson (1-0) gave up two home runs in the seventh and still got the win. Wade Davis pitched two scoreless innings for his second save. Sipp took the loss.\nColby Rasmus homered for Houston, his fourth in five playoff games this October. Carlos Gomez also connected for the Astros. Correa went 4-for-4 and was hit by a pitch.\nBlue Jays 8, Rangers 4: The Blue Jays went deep early and forced a deciding Game 5. Josh Donaldson and Chris Colabello hit home runs before 40-year-old knuckleballer R.A. Dickey threw his first postseason pitch, and the Blue Jays won 8-4 in Game 4 to send the series back to Toronto. Game 5 is Wednesday. Cole Hamels will start for the Rangers against Marcus Stroman in a rematch from Game 2, which Texas won in 14 innings. After losing the first two games in the series at home, the Blue Jays won both games in Texas in a span of 24 hours. Dickey allowed one run over 42/3 innings and was pulled with a 7-1 lead and a runner on base. Then David Price took over and pitched three innings, getting the win after losing in the opener. Kevin Pillar also connected as three of the first eight Toronto hitters homered off Derek Holland , in his first postseason start since 81/3 scoreless innings against St. Louis in Game 4 of the 2011 World Series. Only two teams in MLB history have lost a best-of-five series after winning the first two games on the road â€” Oakland against the New York Yankees in 2001, and Cincinnati to San Francisco in 2012.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/65/8781151/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/65/8781151/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:22:09.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
