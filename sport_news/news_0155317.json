Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Staffers at the Center for a Non Violent Community in Standard took a moment of silence Wednesday morning to honor the local victims of domestic violence. Their courtyard along Standard Road is filled with flags with purple ribbons in observance of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which begins today. A sign in the field reads “429 flags represent victims of domestic violence served this year. Together we can end this violence.” Domestic violence includes physical, verbal and emotional abuse, said Heather Carter, direct services director. Many people don’t realize that domestic violence is more than just physical abuse. It can also include controlling or aggressive behavior within a relationship, staff explained. The 429 people who disclosed that they experienced domestic violence were new clients to CNVC, either through its crisis line or office walk-ins. That number does not include already established clients and is unduplicated. That is more than one person a day, and most victims are from Tuolumne County, said Kellae Brown, direct services coordinator. The center’s staff and volunteer advocates want to let everyone in the community — men, women and children — know they are there for free assistance and support. A person isn’t going to get lectured or scolded or told what they should do, Brown said. The staff also isn’t trying to break up families or force people to leave their spouses, Carter said. If someone does want to leave their significant other, the center has support systems to help. People in society often focus domestic violence conversations on why the person hasn’t left already. “The only people who ask that question are people it’s not happening to,” Carter said. Just because a relationship turns violent doesn’t mean the love one has for the perpetrator goes away, Carter said. The center offers advocacy for victims besides just leaving. “This is a client-driven program,” Brown said. “There will be no ‘you should do this.’ If the person goes back to the situation, we want to be that beacon so, if they ever are ready to leave, we are there for them.” “We are pro-family, whatever that may look like,” Carter said. Domestic violence is an unpleasant subject that nobody wants to think about, staff said. “But it’s rampant,” Carter said. “It is hidden very well in many, many homes.” CNVC, previously the Mountain Women’s Resource Center, has served the community for more than 20 years and isn’t just for women and children, but men, too. The center provides an emergency shelter for women and children and hotel rooms for men who are victims of domestic violence. People in domestic violence situations often think they can’t make it on their own in terms of rent, food, transportation and jobs. CNVC has the resources and abilities to get them out of that situation if they so desire. They also offer help in getting restraining orders. The center also has a Spanish-speaking advocate and encourages Spanish speakers to utilize its free, confidential services. The center also welcomes people from the LGBTQ community. In terms of domestic violence, the CNVC provides an emergency shelter, a transitional shelter, a 24-hour crisis line (533-3401), and a support group from 1 to 2:30 p.m. on Thursdays (with free childcare if given advance notice). Additionally, Tuolumne County Transit has a stop at the center. Anyone can come in at any time between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday for services and support. The phone number is 588-9305. The website is www.nonviolentcommunity.org. Domestic Violence Awareness Month evolved from the first Day of Unity observed in October 1981 by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the NCADV website said. The goal of the observation was to connect battered women’s advocates across the nation. In October 1987, the first Domestic Violence Awareness Month was observed, and the first national toll-free hotline was activated. The CNVC also offers sexual assault survivor services, bullying prevention, peer counseling and therapy.
