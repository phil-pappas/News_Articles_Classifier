Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 10:00 am Knights fall to Cards By JOSH FLICKINGER Sports reporter beloitdailynews.com | 2 comments BELOIT — A mismatch on paper turned into a mismatch at Jacobson Field Friday night. The Middleton Cardinals, armed with a 6-1 record and ranked eighth in the latest WIAA Division 1 poll, dispatched Beloit Memorial 38-7. The Cardinals offense operated at the peak of efficiency in taking a 38-0 lead at the break. Middleton punted only one time, scored touchdowns on their other five possessions and even made a field goal at the first half gun after a long punt return. The Knights, meanwhile struggled up front, not giving quarterback Steven Makinen much time to make plays or their cadre of running backs much room to maneuver. The Knights could muster just 47 yards on 19 carries, while Makinen went 14-for-26 for 105 yards and a touchdown to go along with two interception Middleton quarterback Brennan Schmitt utilized a variety of misdirection plays to pass for three touchdowns, while the Cardinals ground attack was effective as well. “We’ve spent all year talking about how we want those kids to be aggressive,” Wedig said. “Because last year they just kind of sat back and took it. It’s tough because you can’t teach them everything at once. So we preach being aggressive, but at times teams can take advantage of that.” After the Knights picked up a first down on the game’s opening possession, Middleton drove six plays in 41 yards for the touchdown, with Austin Delaney cruising in from eight yards. After Steven Makinen threw an interception, Middleton quickly made it 14-0 on a touchdown pass from Schmitt to Cody Markel from 13 yards away. On Middleton’s next possession, Schmitt found Markel again, this time from eight yards away to make it 21-0. Schmitt’s final scoring pass went to Myron Ashford from 14 yards away. The final Cardinals touchdown of the night came on a Joe Ludwin eight-yard run, while Joey Levin ended the half with a 22-yard field goal. Beloit’s only score came in the fourth quarter on a six-yard pass from Makinen to senior Kevin Raisbeck. “He was playing me inside so I faked outside and he bit on it real hard,” Raisbeck said. “He wasn’t going to guard me after that.” Raisbeck, out for football for the first time in his senior season, said despite the winless season he was pleased he came out. “I didn’t come out for personal stuff,” Raisbeck said. “I came out to help the team. It’s been great seeing all these guys in the weight room, watching them grow. We’ve got some freshmen and sophomores that are going to be really good players if they keep working.” Wedig said the touchdown drive, which covered 11 plays and 75 yards, was Makinen at his best. “That was about as comfortable as I’ve seen Steven during a drive,” Wedig said. “When he gets some time to throw and he feels that comfortable, he’s one of the best quarterbacks in the conference.” The Knights will play their final game of the season Friday night at Madison La Follette, another highly regarded team in the ever-rugged Big Eight conference.
