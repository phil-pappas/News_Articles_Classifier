You've got to play the same way every night and throughout the whole year.\" \nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter. \nThis year, that's more of a focus than ever for the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) junior forward -- to be a constant positive influence while playing a game in which nothing is for certain. \n\"When you look at his year last year, his first half was outstanding with 13 goals,\" head coach Scott Sandelin said. \"His second half, aside from the injury later, needed to be better.\" \nToninato's idea on how to do that is somewhat ironic in that he plans to focus on part of the game other than scoring goals. \n\"It's always nice when you're winning those pucks and getting those bounces,\" he said.\" It gives you a little extra boost. You've got to make your own puck luck. You've got to work hard and do the right things.\" \n\"He's an aggressive guy, and that's when he gets going,\" UMD junior forward Alex Iafallo said. \"Whenever I see that, that kind of motivates me as well.\" \nAnd motivated players can do great things, which is why a lot is expected this season out of UMD's top line. \n\"Yeah, they're going to score some goals,\" assistant coach Brett Larson said, \"but they're going to be fast, they're going to hard to play against, and more than anything they're going to be fun to watch.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:10:54.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
