Throughout elements of the new campaign, consumers will be directed to the newly relaunched BowlSaturdayNight.com , which houses exclusive content such as behind-the-scenes footage and comical Q&A style videos featuring Belmonte, and also serves as a tool for consumers to set up a night of bowling fun in their area.\n\" Jason Belmonte is redefining the bowling landscape with his talent, charisma and energy. His unique style is bringing worldwide attention back to the sport and engaging a young, vibrant audience. It was only natural for us to partner with Jason for our new campaign,\" said Tom Shannon , chief executive, chairman and president of Bowlmor AMF. \"As we mark the one year anniversary of our acquisition of Brunswick bowling centers, we continue to invest heavily in our portfolio of brands, renovating our centers, expanding our food and beverage offerings, and increasing our level of service to enhance the overall experience for both new and existing customers, especially on Saturday nights.\"\nThe payback on Shannon's commitment to center-level investments is in the numbers: Over the past three years, Bowlmor AMF has seen a revenue increase of more than 1,300 percent, including a 42 percent increase in the last fiscal year. The company acquired Brunswick Corporation's bowling center business in September 2014 , and throughout that fiscal year, invested more than $50 million in retail center improvements and conversions across the country, with plans for investing $60 million in FY 2016. The capital expenditure has proven incredibly valuable, as centers converted from traditional bowling alleys to upscale, boutique-style venues see an average revenue increase of more than 100 percent within just two or three months of renovation.\nFollowing the success of the company's previous ad campaign, which marked the first national advertising campaign for a bowling center brand in over 40 years, the new campaign flips the switch on Saturday nights with a simple message that consumers don't have to endure the same mundane entertainment options week in and week out. Instead, they can break from routine and enjoy the unexpected fun and excitement of bowling at a Bowlmor AMF center on a Saturday night.\nThe spots feature Jason Belmonte in a comedic infomercial style, as he performs never-seen-before trick shots in front of a live audience. The typical Saturday night options – stuffy restaurant, crowded bar and noisy nightclub – are recreated on the lanes and Jason, using his famous two-handed style, bowls right through them, taking down the competition piece by piece and ultimately crushing Saturday night with a strike.\nThe new advertising campaign, created by New York -based creative agency Concept Farm, is honing in on the millennial market with an integrated media plan featuring TV spots and digital assets that will appear across traditional and new media outlets, including local cable on stations like ESPN and Bravo as well as HULU and YouTube platforms. In addition to the digital elements and the television spots, which will air throughout the fall 2015 season with 60-second and 30-second commercial units, the fully integrated campaign will be supported through social media and public relations.\nABOUT BOWLMOR AMF\nBowlmor AMF is the largest operator of bowling centers in the world, with more than 300 domestic locations, 8 locations in Mexico , and 3 locations in Canada , specializing in corporate and special events, as well as league and walk-in retail bowling.
