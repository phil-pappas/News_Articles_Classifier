He signed with New England in July after spending last season with Oakland. He also played seven seasons for San Francisco. \nThe Patriots also signed offensive lineman Cameron Fleming from the practice squad. \nThe 23-year-old Fleming, a fourth-round pick out of Stanford last year, was released Sept. 6 and signed to the practice squad two days later. He appeared in seven regular-season games last year and also played in two postseason games, including the Super Bowl. \nThe Patriots are at Indianapolis on Sunday. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:48:09.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
