(Photo: GETTY IMAGES)\n40 CONNECT 51 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE 1. Chuck Pagano has to go now after that bungled fake punt call\nKeeping Pagano is a tough case to make, but hear me out.\nThe Colts shouldn’t get rid of Pagano for the worst call we’ve seen on a football field since Seattle chose to pass from the 1-yard line in the Super Bowl.\nAt least not yet.\nPagano took blame for what was a clear mix-up in communication on a play - or formation - that should never have been called, much less snapped. Make no mistake, it was a mess.\nUSA TODAY\nBell: Colts learn hard way that it takes talent, not tricks, to beat Patriots\nReports of infighting between Pagano and general manager Ryan Grigson won’t make Sunday night’s disaster any easier to stomach. But Pagano is in the final year of his contract, anyway, and the Colts (3-3) are still in first place in a weak AFC South.\nThose calling for Pagano to be fired are merely stuck in an emotional, knee-jerk state.\nIf Indy decides Pagano isn’t the guy it wants to lead its franchise after the playoffs, that’s fine. But to pull the plug now – when the Colts should be able to coast into the postseason – makes no sense.\nUSA TODAY\nPatriots were prepared to defend Colts' trick play they had never seen\n2. The Dolphins should hire Dan Campbell as their permanent head coach\nCompetition, passion and change were just a few buzz words heard at Dolphins HQ this week after interim coach Dan Campbell took over for the fired Joe Philbin. And after Miami pounded the Tennessee Titans 38-10 on the road, there’s a new sense of optimism surrounding the franchise.\n“I think Dan energized us,” quarterback Ryan Tannehill said after the game.\nUSA TODAY\nKen Whisenhunt calls Dolphins' hit on Marcus Mariota 'B.S.' football\nThat’s all well and good, but it’s just one game. And Miami should be in no rush to name their permanent head coach. Mid-season firings sometimes give teams a short-term spark that brings a peak in production. But according to STATS, 25 owners have NFL have fired their head coaches during the season since 2000.\nNone of those made the playoffs the season they fired the coach.\nEven if the Dolphins break that trend as No. 26, they should take their time and weigh all possible options at the end of the year.\n3. The Seahawks are done\nIt doesn’t look good. Seattle’s victories have come against a Bears team that started Jimmy Clausen and the 1-5 Lions, who got hosed on a bad call late in the game that should’ve given them the ball back at the 1-yard line.\nBut consider this: All four Seahawks losses have come after they held fourth-quarter leads in those games.\nThat indicates Seattle’s problems can be fixed. They need to play smarter and more efficiently in the clutch. Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton completed 12 of his 15 passes for 162 yards and one touchdown Sunday – in the fourth quarter alone. That’s unacceptable .\nUSA TODAY\n50 things we learned in Week 6 of the NFL season\nYes, defensive coordinator Dan Quinn moved on to coach the Atlanta Falcons (prompting the promotion of Kris Richard to replace him). And, yes, star linebacker Bobby Wagner – whose absence last season brought similar struggles – being out with a strained pectoral muscle hurts. But the Seahawks need to remember how to finish games.\nThere’s no doubt 2-4 is a big hole to climb out of. But Seattle has been here before. Remember that this is a team that won nine of its last 10 games in the regular season last year and eventually made it to the Super Bowl.\nThe Seahawks can get back in it, but it needs to start now and it needs to start with a defense whose pride is wounded.\nWashington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins (8) prepares to throw the ball in the first quarter against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. (Photo: Vincent Carchietta, USA TODAY Sports)\n4. Kirk Cousins isn’t playing well because of his supporting cast\nThis is a real Quote: from Redskins coach Jay Gruden’s postgame press conference after Cousins threw two more interceptions in a 34-20 loss against the Jets : “Like I said, (it was) also a little windy.”\nHe may have the longest leash in the entire league, but all the excuses being made for Cousins’ play are making Washington’s situation even worse. Sure, it would help to have left tackle Trent Williams and receiver DeSean Jackson back. And a consistent running game would be nice, too, but that doesn’t account for Cousins’ deficiencies.\nHe’s too inaccurate, too careless with the ball (27 interceptions in 20 career games) and lacks the arm strength to make up for it.\nRealistically, Cousins may be the best quarterback on Washington’s roster, as backup Colt McCoy and third-stringer Robert Griffin III have had their struggles, too.\nBut let’s take the training wheels off and stop making excuses for Cousins.\nUSA TODAY\nThe Harrisons: Redskins' Kirk Cousins to keep playing, and opponents rejoice\n5. The NFL’s rules are fine\nThe Bears have a legitimate beef.\nLions receiver Golden Tate’s how-was-that-a-touchdown “catch” in the second quarter proved to be a huge play that had a significant effect in Chicago’s 37-34 loss in Detroit. League executives always talk about protecting the integrity of the game, but ambiguity over what constitutes a catch is diluting actual contests and is impacting outcomes.\nJust ask Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant about the process of a catch.\nIt’s not just Bears fans, however, upset about the ruling. This is coming from fans all over the country. That should tell the NFL’s competition committee it’s time to take a serious look at tweaking the rulebook this offseason and finally making the language that determines the process of a catch … logical.\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Monday Hot Reads: What we learned in Week 6 | 02:16 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero looks at what we learned in Week 6 of the NFL season.
