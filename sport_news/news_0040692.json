Four to Be Inducted Into UTM Sports Hall of Fame Oct. 10 \nMartin, Tenn.- he Class of 2015 for the University of Tennessee at Martin Athletics Hall of Fame has been announced, as former athletics director Phil Dane (2000-13), former soccer player Dani Myrick-Devore (2002-05), former golfer Chris Jones (1997-2001) and former football player Mike Taylor (1984-87) will be enshrined during the 32nd annual Letter Winner’s Breakfast on Saturday, Oct. 10. This year’s Hall of Fame ceremony will be held in the Student Life Center at 7:30 a.m. \nA Martin native, Dane administered facility upgrades for seven different Skyhawk programs and oversaw 21 Ohio Valley Conference championship teams in his tenure, 15 of which came from 2009-13. Seven different athletic programs captured an OVC championship under Dane, five of which went on to win their first-ever OVC title. UT Martin athletics also produced a new program record for OVC Medal of Honor (4.0 Grade Point Average) and OVC Commissioner’s Honor Roll (at least a 3.25 GPA) honorees in three straight years under Dane from 2010-13. \n“It’s an honor to be inducted because of the association with the current Hall of Fame members,” Dane said. “Since Martin is my home and I worked here for 34 years, I know most of them personally. But I really share this honor with all the great students, staff, coaches, administrators, donors and faculty who worked together to achieve the goals we reached over my 14 years.” \nMyrick-Devore’s presence is still felt throughout the Skyhawk soccer record book, as she is the career leader in points (91), goals (35), assists (21) and game-winning goals (eight). A three-time All-OVC honoree under head coach Nathan Pifer, Myrick-Devore also is the record holder for points in a single season (39 as a freshman in 2002) and points in a single match (eight in 2002) while she was the first player in program history to rack up two career hat tricks (both in 2002). The Midwest City, Okla. native will be the first soccer player enshrined into the UT Martin Athletics Hall of Fame. \n“This is a very huge honor,” Myrick-Devore said. “I enjoyed my time at UT Martin more than anything – we were always the underdogs when I was there. I always enjoyed just being a part of the team and I have made friends for a lifetime from those teams. My biggest dream was to play Division-I women’s college soccer and UT Martin provided me that opportunity.” \nA four-year letterman under head coach Grover Page, Jones was the first golfer in UT Martin history to earn a spot on both the All-OVC team and OVC All-Tournament squad in the same season, accomplishing that feat as a sophomore in 1999. The Dyersburg, Tenn. native won the New Orleans Classic before finishing in fifth place with a final score of 217 (72-74-71) in the 1999 OVC Championships before leading the Skyhawks with a 74.2 scoring average as a senior in 2000-01. \n“It is a great privilege to be inducted into the Hall of Fame,” Jones said. “It is something I never would have dreamed of while playing golf there. Some of my fondest memories at UT Martin include playing some great golf courses, the friendships made with my teammates and traveling to different parts of the country that I might not have gotten to see otherwise.” \nTaylor was a four-year starter on UT Martin’s offensive line, logging 44 consecutive starts at either the center or guard position for head coaches Fred Pickard and Don McLeary. The Jackson, Tenn. native has been ranked as the top football line judge in the Southeastern Conference and has worked numerous postseason assignments, including four SEC Championships, the 2005 National Championship and the 2015 Rose Bowl – the first-ever BCS national semifinal game. \n“This is an honor that I am very appreciative of but this award is truly a team effort in my case,” Taylor said. “I accept this on behalf of all of my teammates and coaches that helped an average player be a productive member of those teams. I was able to take what I learned at UT Martin and apply that to officiating and life.” Lady Patriots Soccer Team Hosts Rossview Tues. 6pm \nParis, Tenn.- The Henry County Lady Patriot Soccer team defeated Northeast 10-0 Monday evening in the District Tournament.
