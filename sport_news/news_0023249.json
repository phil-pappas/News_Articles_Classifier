(JC AMBERLYN/Miner) Miner Staff Reporter KINGMAN - Something has to give.When Kingman Academy visits Kingman High for the first-ever football game between the two schools at 7 p.m. today, one of them will walk off the field having put a losing streak behind them.Kingman comes into the game having lost its previous six games after opening the season with a 15-0 win at Chino Valley. The Academy looks to stop its seven-game skid and get its first win of the season. Both teams are tied at the bottom of the Division IV, Section III standings, and the winner gets the benefit of climbing out of that cellar as well.\"This is the week we can keep Academy winless and last,\" said KHS football coach Greg Tonjes. \"We can win our second, which is two more than last year. We're trying to teach our kids to know their moments, and this is our moment.\"Situational teaching doesn't just belong to Kingman (1-6, 0-4). Academy (0-7, 0-4) wants its players to believe that no matter what happens in a game, whether a big play or penalty goes against the Tigers, the team has the players capable of bringing them back. That belief could put the Tigers on the winning side of the scoreboard.\"Kingman is in the same boat. They've lost six in a row,\" said KAHS football coach Dan Stroup. \"This could be about who is going to give up. Most high school football games are lost, not won.\"Kingman has studied the film and understands that Academy's Clayton Holloway and Jordan McDowell-Seybert are a formidable pair of running backs that the Bulldogs must contain. Holloway has rushed for 213 yards at an average of 7.9 yards per carry, and McDowell-Seybert has 396 yards rushing at 5.8 per carry.What Kingman wants to reverse is its trend of falling short in the second halves of close games. In three of their five losses, the Bulldogs went into halftime still in those games and even had leads. But they gave up an average of 28.5 second-half points in those losses.\"We have to finish the second half,\" Tonjes said. \"It's an epidemic for us. You're just not going to win many games like that.\"The Academy has studied film, too, and the Tigers know Kingman's senior running back Isiah Perez needs to be checked. Perez has rushed for 506 yards this season at a 7.2 yards-per-carry clip. Stroup believes his defense is ready for the challenge.\"We have to do a good job stopping Perez. He's a good back and runs hard,\" the coach said. \"We're getting better pursuit and getting better making gang tackles.\"This is the second consecutive week the Tigers are playing at Kingman High School. Last week, the Academy hosted Lee Williams as the home team, and this week the Tigers are the visiting team.\"I really appreciate what Tonjes and (KHS athletic director John) Venenga did for us last week,\" Stroup said. \"Everything they did for us was first class with the way they treated us. It felt like it was our school.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:01:06.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
