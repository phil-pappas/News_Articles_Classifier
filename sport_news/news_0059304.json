Scott G Winterton, Deseret News Summary \nJordan Loveridge, newcomer Lorenzo Bonam among the brightest stars in annual preview scrimmage. “ I thought they did a pretty good job. The best about it — that we all know as coaches — is we get the video. We break it down and now we get to show them ‘Hey, here’s what we’ve been talking about.’” Tommy Connor \nSALT LAKE CITY — Depending on one’s perspective, Utah’s “Night with the Runnin’ Utes ” either put folks to sleep early or kept them up with excitement for how a starter like Jordan Loveridge came out firing in the annual team preview at the Huntsman Center. \nThe senior set the tone for the White team with eight points in a decisive run that quickly turned the first half of the scrimmage into a rout. Loveridge’s squad, which included fellow starters Jakob Poeltl and Brandon Taylor, jumped out to a 21-4 advantage. The lead swelled to 20 at one point before the Red team cut the deficit to 38-27 at the end of the time-shortened half. Loveridge had a game-high 11 points. Newcomer Lorenzo Bonam had 10. \nThe teams were reshuffled a bit at the break and the scoreboard set back to zeroes. Dakarai Tucker nailed a 3-pointer to give that White squad a quick 9-0 edge en route to a 27-22 decision over the Red in a more time-shortened half of action. Poeltl topped the winning team with six points. \nUtah associate head coach Tommy Connor said it was “a typical intra-squad scrimmage after two weeks where guys are worn down and banged up and we don’t have all our bodies and we know exactly what we’re doing.” \nConnor added that it was fun to get out in front of the fans, however. \n“For the most part I thought our guys did some pretty good things,” said Connor, who noted that it's always interesting to see how new guys in the program respond in such a setting. \n“I thought they did a pretty good job,” he continued. “The best about it — that we all know as coaches — is we get the video. We break it down and now we get to show them ‘Hey, here’s what we’ve been talking about.’” \nThe video session that follows, Connor explained, is the best part of these scrimmages. \nWednesday’s gathering also featured a shooting contest — won by Loveridge and a fan — as well as a new 3-D full-court projection video prior to player introductions. The team signed autographs after the scrimmage. \nLoveridge acknowledged that it was an enjoyable outing for the players. \n“We’ve been practicing in closed gyms and no one’s around,” Loveridge said. “But when there’s bright lights and there’s fans in the arena it’s a little bit different.” \nThe Utes , who went 26-9 last season and reached the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16, have an exhibition game with Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 5. The regular-season opener is Nov. 13 against Southern Utah. Both games are at home. \nNEW COMMIT: The Utes picked up a recruiting commitment from Devon Daniels , a 6-foot-4, 195-pound shooting guard from Prolific Prep in Napa, Calif. Daniels made his intentions known via Twitter: “Hardwork and dedication got me here. Blessed to be committing to the University of Utah.” \nScout.com considers Daniels a four-star recruit. \nTwitter: @DirkFacer Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:34:37.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
