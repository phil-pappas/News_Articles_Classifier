Those incentives, collectively worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, quietly helped finance a new industry that formed from an unlikely pairing of rural America and Silicon Valley . Big industry is accustomed to getting big tax breaks. That's the price local governments coast to coast pay for auto plants, battery factories and major league sports.\nData centers don't need people. You might think that would be a disadvantage when it comes to arguing for tax cuts, because they don't have a constituency – prospective employees, for example, or sports fans – to lobby on their behalf.\nTurns out the reverse is true. Since data centers don't need to be near a population center, they can put their computers almost anywhere power and land are cheap. That fact gives them extraordinary leverage.\n\"You could probably locate in a half a dozen states around the region and find somebody who's going to give you the tax breaks,\" said William Fox, an economics professor at the University of Tennessee who studies taxation and economic development.\nSo when Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg sends his staff to cut deals in rural communities, he has his pick of sites in a given region.\n\"Everybody's got the same diner and gas station in a small town. He could almost flip a coin,\" Fox said.\nThe lack of an Oregon sales tax makes the state especially inviting to data centers, because companies don't have to pay taxes on the hundreds of millions of dollars they spend on high-end computers.\nOregon, like most states, levies property taxes on businesses' equipment as well as their land and buildings. But Oregon's enterprise zone program offers local communities the option to exempt properties or projects from all property taxes.\nUnlike many states, where legislatures grant tax breaks on behalf of small cities or counties, Oregon has given communities the authority to negotiate local property tax breaks under the state's enterprise zone progr\nHere's a look at the value of Facebook's savings in Prineville, and what it provides in exchange.\nWhat Facebook gets\nTax exemption : Facebook receives a property tax exemption on its building worth $15.7 million in 2014-15, according to the Crook County assessor. The exemption was worth $12.2 million the prior year. What Facebook provides\nAnnual payments: Facebook pays $110,000 annually in fees under its tax deal. A new deal covering a third data center requires it to pay an additional $190,000 a year. Jobs and wages : 147 employees work in Prineville, including contractors. Facebook says 85 percent live in Crook County. The company's tax deal requires it to pay them 150 percent of Crook County's average wage, or $62,000. State labor data shows the 75 information technology workers in Crook County – which presumably include Apple employees – make an average of $221,000 . Franchise fees : Utility fees provided $600,000 to the city of Prineville last year, 12 percent of the city's annual budget. Facebook says a third data center, now starting construction, will increase franchise fees by 50 percent. Charitable contributions : Facebook says it has provided $1.1 million in grants to Crook County schools and local nonprofits since 2011. The contributions are not required by the tax deal and there is no assurance they will continue. -- Mike Rogoway\nmrogoway@oregonian.com\n503-294-7699\n@rogoway", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/rogoway", "https://www.qualityinfo.org/-/oregon-s-total-and-average-payrolls-recovered-in-2014"], "published": "2015-10-11T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:16:43.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
