(AP) - A Connecticut jury has rejected a woman's bid to sue her 12-year-old nephew for injuries she says she suffered from his exuberant greeting at his birthday party four years ago.\nNew York City resident Jennifer Connell claimed the Westport boy acted unreasonably when he leaped into her arms at his 8th-birthday party. She sued in Bridgeport Superior Court for $127,000.\nThe Connecticut Post reports ( http://bit.ly/1PrB8eR ) that the six-member jury found Tuesday that the boy was not liable.\nThe 54-year-old Connell had argued the boy caused her to fall to the ground and break her wrist. She testified she loves her nephew but thinks he should be held accountable.\nShe said when the child jumped she tumbled to the ground as she tried to catch him.\nA listed phone number couldn't be found for the youngster's father.\nInformation from: Connecticut Post, http://www.connpost.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1PrB8eR"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:34:15.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
