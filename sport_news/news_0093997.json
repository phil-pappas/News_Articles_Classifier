And it explains everything about Al-Shaair's daily approach to football, and why he's already made an impact despite being just a freshman.\n\"[Lewis] was talking about how every day for five years how he would do 100 pushups after every practice and 100 pushups when he first woke up,\" said Al-Shaair, who has led the Owls in tackles the past two games. \"Upon hearing that, it made me want to work.\"\nEach day, Al-Shaair holds true to form. Often, he is the last to leave the practice field. He makes the trek to the locker room only after completing the post-practice workout. It's his way of searching for any edge possible.\n\"I look at film a lot,\" Al-Shaair said. \"When you're smaller guy like me, you've got to find an edge somewhere. You need to be a step faster. Even though I'm not as big, if I get there before he gets there, I can still hit him before he has a chance to hit me. It helps me out a lot.\"\nDefensive back Ocie Rose among FAU's impact freshmen Shandel Richardson Florida Atlantic defensive back Ocie Rose expected to have an early impact.\nJust not this early.\nRose earned a starting role by the fourth week of the season and has no plans of relinquishing it.\n\"I expected to come in [and] play because of the way I work and practice,\" Rose said. \"I wanted to...\nFlorida Atlantic defensive back Ocie Rose expected to have an early impact.\nJust not this early.\nRose earned a starting role by the fourth week of the season and has no plans of relinquishing it.\n\"I expected to come in [and] play because of the way I work and practice,\" Rose said. \"I wanted to...\n(Shandel Richardson) At 6-foot-1 and 205, Al-Shaair is the smallest of the team's linebackers. He played safety throughout high school before switching positions upon arrival at FAU. Size hasn't affected his success.\n\"It wasn't that bad,\" Al-Shaair said of the transition. \"I just think when you're talking about the transition, it's more about getting your gaps and hitting the right spots. You can't just fly around and make plays.\"\nDefensive coordinator Roc Bellantoni said Al-Shaair has a \"chance to be pretty good\" as he gains experience and weight. The hope is he reaches 240 pounds by his senior year. For now, the coaching staff will just enjoy his ability to make plays on instincts alone.\nInjured Robert Relf still having impact on FAU linebackers Florida Atlantic linebacker Robert Relf played just one half this season.\nStill, that hasn't prevented him from making an impact on the linebacker unit.

Relf, who is redshirting after sustaining a season-ending shoulder injury in the opener, has taken on a mentor role for the younger and less experienced...\nRead the story \"He is fast enough and has the instincts to be able to shed a block and go make a play that's not in his gap,\" Bellantoni said. \"â€¦ Obviously, he's chasing things down from the back side.\"\nAbout the only issue Al-Shaair has to conquer is controlling his emotions on the field. During training camp, he was kicked out of practice after getting into two incidents with teammates.\n\"That's just me as a person, just high end,\" Al-Shaair said. \"I'm an emotional person. The game is just a blessing. You have an opportunity to play as a true freshman and there's a lot of emotion. People are counting a lot on me and there's a lot of weight on me. It just comes out that way.\"\nAl-Shaair, who is fourth on the team with 24 tackles, has been a big reason the Owls have offset the loss of junior Robert Relf. Relf was lost for the season after sustaining a shoulder injury in the season-opener against Tulsa.\n\"Basically, the linebackers said it there were a lot of odds against us,\" Al-Shaair said. \"We just rally around each other and just keep working.\"\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56157b35/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-1008-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56157c4d/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-1006-20151005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616c111/turbine/fl-fau-owls-main-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:26:51.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
