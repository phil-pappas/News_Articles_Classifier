But economists said on Monday reforms needed to help the indebted country’s meagre growth after a steep recession in 2011-13 would be more difficult to pass and the austerity-minded government could face political turmoil next year. The election “will further constrain the potential for structural economic reforms and increase risks to the fiscal outlook”, said Eurasia Group analyst Federico Santi, adding the “likelihood that the new legislature will not reach the end of its four-year term is quite high”. President Anibal Cavaco Silva must name the new Prime Minister after talking to all political leaders with discussions likely to start later this week and take around two weeks. Passos Coelho would be the first leader in Europe to be re-elected after imposing hardship on voters under international bailout packages during the sovereign debt crisis. His government raised taxes while cutting public spending, but argued during the campaign that the country was now beginning to see the fruits of those measures with a gradual return to growth after three years of recession. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:17:57.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
