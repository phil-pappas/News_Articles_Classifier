The U.S. Men's National Team is a mess. There is no other way to say it after a disastrous Gold Cup and a gut-wrenching loss to Mexico in the CONCACAF Cup.\nAdChoices The squad looks old, something coach Jurgen Klinsmann has to know, which is why he has to start thinking about integrating more new blood into his player pool, even with World Cup qualifying set to kick off next month.\nMORE: Best photos from U.S.-Mexico Confederations Cup match | International soccer rivalries\nJust how bad are things in the player pool? A closer look suggests that while there are still too many older players who can make good claims to being the best options at a variety of positions, there are good prospects in the pipeline at most positions. The real question is: How long will it take those prospects to get to a level good enough to merit a call-up?\nKlinsmann is in an interesting predicament because his window to experiment openly has closed on him after the team's run of bad results. Klinsmann spent the six months after the World Cup trying out different things, bringing in new faces, testing out different formations. There were some poor results, but it was chalked up to that experimentation. Now, with so many bad results in recent months, Klinsmann may not have the luxury of testing out things and running the risk of more losses.\nThe November World Cup qualifiers will tell us plenty about just how much pressure Klinsmann is facing, and how much freedom he still has to try things. If Klinsmann keeps trotting out squads loaded with players in their mid-30s, then it will be clear he no longer feels safe in his job enough to experiment. If Klinsmann brings in a young team to qualifying next month, that will be a very clear sign he still isn't feeling that much pressure.\nWhat are Klinsmann's options when it comes to choosing his team? In Part I of a three-part look at the state of the U.S. player pool, position by position, we begin with goalkeeper and defenders:\nGOALKEEPERS\nThe starter: Tim Howard. After a year out of the starting lineup, Howard is ready to retake the top spot. We know Klinsmann called it an open competition and said he would rotate goalkeepers, but as things stand, Howard is the clear choice to be the No. 1.\nThe backup: Brad Guzan. Did an admirable job filling in for Howard and could still be the starter eventually, but should sit behind Howard going forward.\nDon't forget about . . . Bill Hamid. Klinsmann may seem reluctant to incorporate him on a consistent basis, but Hamid is the best American goalkeeper in MLS and, at 24, only has room to grow.\nTime to say goodbye to . . . Nick Rimando. A good teammate, and someone who made the most of his appearances, but at 36, Rimando needs to make way for the next generate of goalkeepers.\nOne for the future: Ethan Horvath. Currently starting matches for Norwegian side Molde, the 20-year-old netminder recently started in Olympic qualifying for the U.S. and is already drawing raves from overseas.\nRIGHT BACK\nThe starter: Fabian Johnson. It may seem strange to list a player who may never play for Klinsmann again, but there's no denying he's the best option in the U.S. player pool, so for now, he stays on the list. It will be interesting to see just how long it takes for Johnson and Klinsmann to make up, assuming they ever do.\nThe backup: DeAndre Yedlin. Though Klinsmann has preferred him in a right wing role, Johnson's looming banishment might make it necessary to give Yedlin a long look at fullback earlier than Klinsmann would have liked.\nTime to say goodbye to . . . Brad Evans. He turned in an admirable shift in the loss to Costa Rica, but he'll be 31 in the spring and it's time to look at younger options. Klinsmann may have to hold off on saying goodbye, though, if Johnson doesn't return to the national team any time soon.\nDon't forget about . . . Timmy Chandler. Many U.S. fans will want to forget about Chandler's showing at the Gold Cup, but that awful tournament doesn't change the fact Chandler is a German Bundesliga starter when healthy and one of the few natural options at a thin position.\nOne for the future: Desevio Payne. Though he was a bit overshadowed by the center backs and goalkeeper on the U.S. Under-20 World Cup team, Payne was very impressive at right back. Having broken through with Dutch side Groningen last year, Payne has fallen off the radar a bit due to injuries, but the 19-year-old is definitely one to keep an eye on when he returns to full health and starts seeing first-team minutes in the Netherlands.\nRIGHT CENTER BACK\nThe starter: Geoff Cameron. After spending almost a year without playing in this spot, Cameron showed in recent matches that he is the best option in the pool.\nThe backup: Ventura Alvarado. Yes, he is very raw, and his shakiness in recent months has soured plenty of U.S. fans on his potential, but he's 23, on a big team in Club America, and Klinsmann loves him. He needs to get better to keep his current place on the depth chart, but there's no denying he's being given every chance to succeed.\nTime to say goodbye to . . . Michael Orozco. Why say goodbye to a player who doesn't turn 30 until January? There are simply better options, both younger and older, and Orozco isn't likely to get much better than he is now. That hasn't stopped Klinsmann from continuing to call him in, but in a crowded picture at center back, Orozco looks like the one most likely to lose out.\nDon't forget about . . . Omar Gonzalez. There is no denying his form is in a bad place right now, which explains why he has fallen out of the national team picture for the moment, but he's only a year removed from being dominant and at 27 there is little reason to think he can't regain his best form.\nOne for the future: Cameron Carter-Vickers. The hype train slowed down on Carter-Vickers after his so-so showing in Olympic qualifying, but when you consider he's still just 17, you realize just what a special talent we're talking about. He's a few years away from being a force, and he has all the attributes to be a national team starter eventually.\nLEFT CENTER BACK\nThe starter: Matt Besler. Overcame a drop in form after a very taxing 2014 in time to regain his starting spot after John Brooks went down with an injury. It is clear Klinsmann sees Brooks as the future, and a healthy and in-form Brooks seems a safe bet to return to the starting lineup, but for now Besler should be the option as World Cup qualifying begins.\nThe backup: John Brooks. The lasting memory of his Gold Cup struggles has erased the memories of his impressive World Cup, but the reality is he's still just 22 and has the talent to be worth considering as a future starter. He needs to get healthy, though, and get back to being a regular for Hertha Berlin. Until he does that, he will sit behind Besler.\nDon't forget about . . . Matt Hedges. If Hedges played in a major media market he would be receiving significantly more buzz, which would be deserved given the outstanding season he's having with FC Dallas. Technical and boasting good size, Hedges keeps getting better, and at 25 he still has room to grow as a player.\nOne for the future: Matt Miazga. The Red Bulls defender had a breakout season this year. He started on the top team in the league and is coming off an impressive showing at the Under-20 World Cup. A move to Europe seems inevitable in 2016.\nLEFT BACK\nThe starter: Tim Ream. He may not be the most natural fit at the position, but Ream understands the spot and has the tools to be a serviceable starting option for the immediate future until a more dynamic option emerges. Ream's positioning and passing make him a player who should be able to hold things down in CONCACAF World Cup qualifying, but he probably isn't the long-term answer at the position.\nThe backup: Greg Garza. Now facing a long recovery after hip surgery, Garza has been sidelined for a while with an injury dating to the start of 2015. We haven't seen his best in a year, but those who remember him at his best know he just might wind up being the top option by the time the Hexagonal rolls around in 2017, if not sooner.\nTime to say goodbye to . . . DaMarcus Beasley. Yes, he can still do the job, but Beasley is 33 and it's time to look at other players. The next round of CONCACAF qualifying is a good time to try out some younger options.\nDon't forget about . . . Brek Shea. It's easy to forget the Orlando City speedster was a regular part of Klinsmann's plans before injuries sidelined him. At the start of the year he was seen as a left back option, with the help of Orlando City playing him there. Injuries ended that experiment. though, leaving Shea to play in midfield before being sidelined by surgery. Now that he's back, Shea could once again develop into a left back option, particularly if Orlando City gives him another shot at the position in 2016.\nOne for the future: John Requejo. The Club Tijuana defender did relatively well at the Under-20 World Cup, and the Xolos are said to have plans for him to see more minutes with the first team in coming seasons.\nIn Part II of this series, we'll examine the midfield.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer-news/4657836-united-states-mexico-aguilar-strike-sends-mexicans-to-confederations-cup", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4645991-international-soccer-rivalries-germany-usa-mexico-france-brazil-argentina-england/slide/327596", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657834-fifa-confederations-cup-playoff-usa-mexico-soccer-photos-pictures-deandre-yedlin-arturo-rivas-jermaine-jones/slide/364198", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:50:26.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
