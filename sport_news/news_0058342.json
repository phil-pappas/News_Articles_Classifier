I’m really proud of these boys because they’ve opened up big holes for (running backs) Mario (Garcia), Anthony (Cantu), and for Money all season.” \nSt. Joseph averages 415 yards (264 rushing, 151 passing) and 58 points per game. The Bloodhounds have scored 406 points through seven games this season. \n“Everyone asks how we score so many points, and it’s not a secret,” Villarreal said. “Having multiple weapons and being able to pick and choose what the defense gives you, sometimes teams are too run heavy and others are too pass heavy. Our offensive line has given us the luxury to pick either play. \n“We even trust them to give us a fourth-and-10, a fourth-and-13, and that’s no problem for us to run the football behind them if (the opponent) is going to have five men deep.” \nThe five players are fine with being rather anonymous. They prefer their work done in the trenches, and the rewards of their toils have come in the win column. That has come to fruition six of seven times this season. \n“As long as we can get a space for Kai or the running backs to score, that’s all we need,” Abraham Caram said as the spokesman for his fellow linemen. “As long as we win, that’s the priority.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
