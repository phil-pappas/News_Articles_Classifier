With the Kardashians, it’s one drama after another. And with the Utes , the Travis Wilson story just keeps giving.\nIt’s a recurring theme. Wilson made Oregon look like Keystone Cops. But he followed that up with a modest two-interception night against Cal. Saturday in a 34-18 win over Arizona State, he was better.\nHis rushing game is always a bonus on a team that already has Devontae Booker. But his passing? His short throws, most of the time, are fine, but his downfield game can be off-and-on.\nSaturday it was not bad.\n“We are not really potent on offense unless we’re throwing the ball well,” coach Kyle Whittingham said a few days before meeting Arizona State. “It’s all great to have a tailback like Devontae and be able to run the rock like we have, but you have to be able to throw to be a complete offense. Look back at last year’s game (at ASU). I still feel the same way. We should have thrown the ball more in that game.”\nThey worked on it against ASU.\nThe game’s first touchdown looked painfully easy. Wilson completed passes of 16, 21 and 21 yards before finishing off with a play-action pass to Harrison Handley.\nFor most of the night, Wilson looked as advertised: a seasoned senior whose job is to manage games, not dominate them. He made some nice throws, but also overthrew receivers a few deep routes. Early in the game, he was making his mid-range passes but missing on the long stuff.\nAnd then he was suddenly the monster that devoured Oregon, connecting on a 42-yard streak to Kenneth Scott and following with the 11-yard scoring pass. He threw a 29-yard completion up the middle to Ken Hampel and a 22-yard completion to Tyrone Smith on third-and-12.\nThe Utes weren’t killing it, but Wilson was in the groove and on the move.\nAt the half, he was 18-24 for 220 yards passing.\nThe closeness of the game certainly wasn’t Wilson’s fault. Nor was it the defense’s. ASU had only 91 yards in the first half. But poor special teams coverage kept the Sun Devils close.\nWilson’s confidence was obvious. He found Kenneth Scott for 35 yards in the third quarter and finished with 297 passing yards on 26-36 passing.\nNot huge numbers.\nWilson numbers.\nThat’s the never-ending story.\nIt’s not all on Wilson.\nBut of course it will be, all season.\nBut it wasn’t a pass but a pitch that might have been his best play. Wilson waited until just the right moment early in the fourth quarter to pitch to Booker for a 25-yard scoring play with 10:41 remaining, giving Utah a 21-18 lead. Booker didn’t stop until he hit traffic at Point of the Mountain.\nWilson followed by moving them into field goal range twice more, which Andy Phillips converted.\nUneven as Wilson has been in his career — he once threw six picks in a game — he’s better than his predecessor, Jordan Wynn. With the latter, it was a gamble if he’d even be upright on game day. Wilson has been remarkably durable, willing to play through the stuff that happens.\nHow good would the Utes be if he were more dominating? Against Oregon he was fast with his reads and delivery, perfect in his audibles, decisive with his execution. He was iffy against Cal, seldom moving the team via the pass. Even so, he went into that game with the No. 1 Total Quarterback Rating in the country. This week he was rated No. 7 on the ESPN metric.\nHe was good enough on Saturday, which is the way he’ll probably be all year.\nWilson maintains a temperament that protects him from critics. He fields questions without getting defensive, but without revealing anything, either. He doesn’t deny responsibility, but doesn’t put it all on himself.\nIf the Utes are going to take this season some place important, he’ll need to stay Good Travis, not Flaky Travis. On Saturday, he was Good Enough Travis. He’ll never be All-American, but he could end up with a reality show. Either that or making a run for president.\nEmail: rock@desnews.com ; Twitter: @therockmonster; Blog: Rockmonster Unplugged", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639304%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445212366", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639304%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445212365", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639304%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445212366", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639304%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445212365"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:02:07.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
