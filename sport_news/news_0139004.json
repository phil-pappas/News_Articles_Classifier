Egypt reacted immediately by launching airstrikes on ISIS strongholds in Libya.\n“There are 5000 ISIS fighters in Derna and Sirte. So the Libyan army’s main task is fighting terrorism, and that might require extra troops and hardware,” Al-Dairi added.\nEgypt’s president Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi blamed \"the international community\" for the Libyan crisis and the spread of terrorism there in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday. In 2011, a NATO force drawn from many member-states intervened militarily in Libya.\n\"The threat posed by terrorism endangers Libya's neighbors and the rest of Africa, so I emphasise the need encourage engagement with Libyans who believe in a modern state, alongside relentless efforts to eradicate terrorism,\" Al-Dairi continued.\nEgypt has been a key player in mediating the Libyan crisis since El-Sisi took office in 2014, hosting several meetings for political factions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:21:01.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
