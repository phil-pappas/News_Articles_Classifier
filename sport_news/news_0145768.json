But Fassel remembers how it was when he was named the Giants ' head coach in 1997. After the introductory press conference, Fassel took one call – from good friend and former 49ers head coach George Seifert – before it just got to be too much. \n\"They handed me a list of calls I got. And I couldn't have gotten through them in a year,\" Fassel told NJ Advance Media during a phone interview. \"I know what's going on when you get named a head coach. Everybody wants to say hello to you. \n\"The lights are on [Campbell] now. And that's his personality. His first thing is not going to be returning phone calls, and telling people how nice it is and all that.\" PLUS : Could former Rutgers coach Greg Schiano end up in Miami? \nInstead, Fassel said, Campbell, who played for him from 1999-2002 with the Giants, is going to go right to work and try to turn around a 1-3 Miami team that entered the year with high expectations , but has been one of the league's biggest disappointments after the first month of the season. \n\"The hours are six in the morning until midnight. It consumes your whole life. And right now, I don't think he thinks of anything but football ... his name's on it now,\" Fassel said. \"It has to be a passion. And Dan's got the passion. I knew that as a player. He paid his dues to get where he is now. He's got the energy, he's got the smarts, he's got all the things. \n\"There's a transition between player and coach. He's got to define what he believes in. And with his passion and commitment to football, I think the players will respond to that, no matter however he handles it. The players will eventually respect the fact that he is dedicated to football and winning.\" \nFassel said he never knew Campbell wanted to go into coaching after his playing career was over. But when Campbell made the decision, Fassel said he was not surprised, because the physical, versatile journeyman, \"has a love of the game.\" \n\"Dan was just a guy who showed up with his lunch pail. Every day, he came to work,\" Fassel said. \"Mentally and physically, he was a tough guy. He loved the game. He took it seriously. He didn't make mistakes. He knew what he was doing. He was always prepared. \n\"I never had a problem with the guy, not one time. He never showed up late, he never skipped a treatment, he never skipped a weight training, nothing. He was just a guy that you say, 'He's going to show up for you.'\" \nPLUS : Why the Bills' criticism of Odell Beckham Jr. seems unjustified \nWhenever a player would tell Fassel they were interested in coaching, Fassel said he would caution them how long the hours are, and warn them not to \"get into coaching for the money or the publicity of it. Because you won't make it.\" \n\"You've got to be committed, and you've got to start to work at the bottom, and work your way up,\" Fassel said. \"After a guy plays, if he plays very long, he's probably got enough money to accept a job that's not paying hardly anything. You have to be solely committed to it. It's got to be a passion.\" \nAnd that will not be an issue for Campbell. \n\"I thought Dan could be anything he wants. ... He's a hard-working guy,\" Fassel said. \"You knew he was going to be successful in life in whatever he chose to be. I wasn't surprised when he went into coaching, because I know he has a love of the game.\" TALK IS CHEAP, Ep. 26: The Giants are the best team in the NFC East \nAfter Sunday's impressive and dominant 24-10 win in Buffalo, one thing is clear: The NFC East is the Giants' division to lose.
