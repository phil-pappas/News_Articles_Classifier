View More... \nRockport — The No. 9 John Bapst field hockey team had not won a road game all season. \nThough No. 8 Camden Hills was aware of this, hosting the Crusaders of Bangor on Saturday, Oct. 17 in a Class B North prelim playoff game, the Windjammers certainly did not rest on their laurels. \nAnd it showed. \nThe Windjammers could not have played better in the first 30 minutes of the postseason as the hosts sailed out of the gate with three first-half goals and added another for good measure in the second en route to an impressive 4-0 victory. \nWith the win, Camden Hills (8-7) advances to the quarterfinal round, where it will face top-seeded Gardiner (12-2) on Tuesday, Oct. 20 at 3:30 p.m. in Gardiner. \nCamden Hills played Gardiner on Oct. 6 at Thomas College in Waterville, as the Tigers scored a goal in the final five minutes to pick up a 1-0 win. \nJohn Bapst's season ended at 3-11-1. \nA link to more photos from the Camden Hills and John Bapst playoff game will appear later with this story. \n“They play a Class C schedule [and] they're not a [Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference] team so we don't know a lot about them,” said Windjammer coach Lindsey Clement of the Crusaders. “We knew how they looked last fall and we knew they lost their goalie. She was a senior, she graduated and she was All-State, so we knew that was a weakness for them and that we were going to have to try to capitalize on that early.” \nClement said they were not looking past the Crusaders, but the fact John Bapst had not won an away game and played a weaker schedule then the Windjammers did this season “was in our favor.” \nThe Windjammers' well-rounded scoring attack was led by Hilary Merrifield, Sadie Mills, Emily Bowen and Emily Daggett with one goal, while Daggett, Molly Davee and Willow Grinnell logged assists. \nNot only did Camden Hills' offense click on all cylinders in the first half, the defense was stellar as well as the Windjammers only allowed the Crusaders to cross midfield on three occasions. \nCamden Hills held a whopping 18-1 advantage in shots and 9-1 in penalty corners. Jenna Stearns made one save in the cage for the hosts, while Samantha Cole was busy throughout the morning and early afternoon for the visitors, as she turned away 14 Windjammer shots. \nMerrifield got the scoring started with 22:12 left in the first half with an unassisted score, while Mills banged the back of the cage minutes later with 19:13 remaining, off an assist from Daggett. \nNext was Bowen with time winding down in the first half, as she took a pass from Davee, inserted off a penalty corner, and fired a rocket from the arc of the penalty circle past the Crusader goalie with 4:34 left, which prompted a John Bapst timeout. \nDaggett cleaned up a rebound in front of the Crusader cage off an initial shot by Grinnell with 13:27 left to round out the scoring. \nClement was happy with the team's first-half performance, but conceded her team looked “sloppy” in the second, which it will need to sure up against an opponent like Gardiner. \nClement said the Windjammers were down a midfielder, Megan Gordon, and brought up a jayvee player, Courtney King, who played the full game and “performed really well,” also getting significant time in the team's regular-season finale at Winslow. \nGordon will return for the team's upcoming quarterfinal playoff. \nClement said the game against the Tigers was “back and forth” and “could have gone either way” and the Windjammers hope for a similar type of contest against the defending regional champions. \n“We have a solid group of seniors that set the pace for the team and they are excited for playoffs,” the coach said. “Their intensity and leadership should serve us well with Gardiner. We'll be a complete team on Tuesday and that should add to our strength.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:22:12.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
