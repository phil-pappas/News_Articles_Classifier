She joins Agnieszka Radwanska , who pulled out Sunday saying she wanted to recover after winning the Tianjin Open. \nIn the men's competition, seventh-seeded Joao Sousa of Portugal went out in the first round, losing 7-6 (2), 4-6, 7-5 to Spain's Daniel Gimeno-Traver . \nThink your friends should see this?
