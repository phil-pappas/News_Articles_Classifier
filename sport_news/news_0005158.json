And it's not athleticism, either, even with a roster that now includes Donovan Mitchell, Deng Adel and Ray Spalding, three impact freshman with hops and quickness.\nIt's shot blocking.\n\"I think they'll be, as I look at our strengths, one of the leading shot-blocking teams in the nation, something I've never had,\" Pitino said Tuesday at the U of L hoops tipoff luncheon.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nPitino promises answers in emotional speech\nIn a system built on frenetic scurrying, a defense made to speed opponents up, shoot gaps, get steals and deflect passes, blocking shots has become a forgotten element of Louisville's identity. It is not one of the primary building blocks of the program's playing style.\nBut Pitino's teams have actually ranked among the top 40 shot-blocking teams in the nation in 10 of his 14 seasons at U of L, including the 2008-09 campaign, when the Cardinals blocked 223 shots, the fourth-highest total in Division I college hoops.\nThat season, U of L posted a seventh-best 15.3 block percentage, which is calculated by measuring the team's blocks against the number of 2-point attempts by the opponents. And last season's team, for all of Pitino's frustrations with his defense, ranked 15th in the nation in block percentage and ninth in total blocks.\nYet Pitino and his staff don't look at statistics like that – block percentage, blocks per game or total blocks – to evaluate how good their team's shot blocking is or can be.\nInstead, Pitino explained Wednesday, the goal is to challenge every shot as the defense rotates. Some challenges lead to blocks, he said, while others lead to tough shot attempts.\n\"You have to be careful that players just don't leave their feet and get beat with weak-side rebounding,\" Pitino said.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nLewis, Snider together a work in progress\nThat's why the current group has caught Pitino's eye. His roster is armed with two 7-footers and three 6-foot-10 guys, though one of them, sophomore Matz Stockman, is probably still a year away from consistently contributing. It will help having the 6-7 Adel, who is described as the strongest and best defensive player on the squad by his teammates.\nWith that group, Louisville's athleticism and quickness in its frontcourt has the potential to close out opponents and challenge shots while still rebounding at a high rate, which is just what Pitino wants. And the length of those seven frontcourt guys plays the biggest factor. Adel, the shortest of the group, has a 6-9 1/2 wingspan. Spalding, Stockman, Jaylen Johnson, Anas Mahmoud, Mangok Mathiang and Chinanu Onuaku each have wingspans that measure 7 feet or more.\nThat kind of size has already showed up in practice, Pitino said.\n\"We probably have close to 15-25 blocked shots per practice, which is very unusual,\" he told the crowd at the luncheon Tuesday.\nIt also showed up this summer during the team's week-long exhibition series in Puerto Rico, when Mathiang, the team's leader in blocks the past two seasons, had two multiple-block games. Chris Jones, the former U of L guard who is now playing abroad, said Mathiang's \"timing is great.\"\nGet the CJ’s free UofL CardsHQ newsletter\n\"His timing is great, and he's mighty long, but he came a long way, and now it seems like he's enjoying it and trying to focus on it more,\" Jones said.\nOnuaku, in his time with the United States U19 squad, finished fifth in blocks per game at the FIBA World Championships. And Spalding, who posted five blocks in one game against the Puerto Rican national team in August, has impressed the staff with his shot-blocking prowess.\nSo the potential is there. Now they just have to live up to the preseason Pitino hype.\nFollow U of L hoops writer Jeff Greer on Twitter ( @jeffgreer_cj ) for regular Cards updates.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/660c71d9102dd532d98ed376819fe06f07e6444f/c=667-0-3334-2667/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Louisville/Louisville/635803457769530185-9x5a5450x.jpg", "https://twitter.com/jeffgreer_cj", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a153210ac0978a7d8c26d5f1929839ad09c1c873/c=0-336-2329-2665/local/-/media/2015/06/30/Louisville/B9317917677Z.1_20150630162533_000_G4OB7Q3VP.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:06:58.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
