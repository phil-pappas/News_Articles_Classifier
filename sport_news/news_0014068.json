He didn't connect on 14 straight attempts at one point, including all 13 of his attempts in the third quarter. \nTexas A&M managed just 192 total yards. \n\"We couldn't move the ball,\" Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin said. \"Turnovers. Penalties. We couldn't get off the field fast enough on defense in the first half.\" \nThe Ole Miss (6-2, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) offense wasn't great, but good enough to win. Chad Kelly threw for 241 yards and two touchdowns, Laquon Treadwell caught five passes for 102 yards and a touchdown and Jaylen Walton ran for 97 yards. \nTexas A&M (5-2, 2-2) has lost two straight. It was the first true road game this season and its offense looked disjointed most of the night. Allen seemed to regress as the game progressed and Hubenak wasn't much better, completing 6 of 11 passes for 46 yards. \nOle Miss jumped out to a 16-3 lead by halftime and put the game out of reach with a 58-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Treadwell with 9:16 left in the third quarter. \nThe Rebels then relied on their defense to coast to a surprisingly one-sided win. \n\"We've got a five-game season if we want to play for an SEC Championship,\" Walton said. \"This is one down and we played well. Hopefully, we will keep preparing good and playing this well. \n\"But there is still a long way to go.\" \nThe victory was vital for Ole Miss as it continues to control its own fate in the Western Division thanks to a win over Alabama in September. The Rebels are still a game behind first-place LSU, but host the Tigers on Nov. 21 in Oxford. \nOle Miss made plenty of mistakes on Saturday — Kelly threw three interceptions — but still pushed out to a 13-0 lead midway through the second quarter following a 7-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Evan Engram and two field goals. \nThe final few minutes of the second half were eventful with three turnovers on three consecutive plays — two by Texas A&M and one by Ole Miss. The Rebels were able to convert the Aggies' second miscue into a field goal for a 16-3 halftime lead. \nOle Miss left tackle Laremy Tunsil started his first game of the season after serving a seven-game NCAA suspension for receiving illegal benefits. It appeared the All-SEC junior had an immediate impact — the Rebels ran for 230 yards after having just 40 yards on the ground total in last week's loss to Memphis. \nOle Miss played without star defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche, who suffered a concussion last week against Memphis. The Rebels didn't seem to miss him. \nTexas A&M's only points came on a 44-yard field goal by Taylor Bertolet in the second quarter. \n\"It's not just one position, it's every position when you've got things like this,\" Sumlin said. \"We have to get our best people on the field, playing at a high level, eliminating crucial mistakes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:27:30.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
