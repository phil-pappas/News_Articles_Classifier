Superheroes don’t allow mortals, even those responsible for their superhero bank accounts, to publicly gripe about mission counts. Superheroes don’t miss superhero training sessions. Harvey won his Game 3 start against the Dodgers in the NLDS, but it was a sweaty, unphotogenic, five-inning slog after which everyone admitted he didn’t have his best stuff, not at all the type of rousing adventure that someone like Christopher Nolan would want to shoot.\nAfter all that, Harvey had gone into manager Terry Collins’s office prior to the decisive Game 5 in Los Angeles to volunteer his services in relief, perhaps in part to reestablish his reputation. Collins had told him to focus on his next assignment: Game 1 of the NLCS, on Saturday night in Queens, if the Mets reached it.\n“I wanted this game bad,” Harvey would say.\nIt didn’t take Mets catcher Travis d’Arnaud long during pregame warm-ups to realize that he was dealing with a different Harvey than he had five days earlier.\n“I could tell by the first pitch I caught,” d’Arnaud said. “A paint”—meaning on the edge of the plate—“down-and-away fastball. The next one was a paint, down-and-in fastball. I knew it was going to be a fun night for the both of us.”\nMLB Video Dominant Harvey performance lifts Mets past Cubs in NLCS Game 1 by Jon Tayler", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@SI_BenReiter"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:17:33.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
