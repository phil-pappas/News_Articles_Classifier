And he blamed himself, along with the human nature that comes with life among college football's blue bloods.\n\"It's something I haven't done a good job with this year,\" he said. \"I did a little better last year, I think, of making sure we're still the hunter, and we're still hungry and determined and we still keep our edge.\n\"I think I lost my edge a little, quite honestly. It's something I don't want to happen. I'm not standing here because I was edgeless. I'm standing here because I had an edge about me for a long time as a person and as a coach. I don't want to lose that or let somebody take it away from me.\"\nBriles isn't the first coach to lament a loss of full-blown intensity within his team. When you are ranked in the top five to start the season, it's easy to meet a nonconference schedule of SMU, Lamar and Saturday's opponent, Rice, with a collective yawn.\nWhat Briles and every other coach struggle with is figuring out why his team isn't as laser-focused as he would like.\n\"That's a good question,\" he said. \"Everything starts mentally. You got to be careful and guarded about having a minimal amount of success. And we've had a small amount. Anytime you think everything's OK, it's not. So you got to really be careful that you don't become satisfied.\n\"Happy teams get beat. I learned that a long time ago because somebody unhappy is going to take you down. So we got to maintain an unhappiness about us, a hunger about us. And that's my responsibility.\"\nThe results have been good on paper. A pair of 35-point wins sounds impressive. But the Bears were up only by a touchdown against SMU at halftime and were behind Lamar late in the first half.\nThey also have suffered more mental miscues than Briles would like.\nQuarterback Seth Russell's three interceptions against Lamar made life tougher than it should have been for the Bears.\n\"It's just a mentality,\" Russell said. \"We have to have an edge. And that's something Coach Briles said we haven't had the last two weeks.\"\nThe Bears will not overlook Rice, which has been a consistent bowl-eligible team, playing in the postseason in four of the last seven seasons, including the last three in a row. Briles went so far as to call it \"a conference game\" because it's against a team in Texas.\nBut it's clear that the price of poker goes up for the Bears the following week when they play Texas Tech in the Big 12 opener that will feature a Red Raiders team that rates as the surprise of the league so far.\nIt won't make a difference if the Bears don't upgrade their sharpness. And the off week last Saturday should help, Briles said.\n\"We're at a point now where [outside] people aren't happy with where we're at,\" he said. \"I'm happy where we're at. But we understand how we're perceived by people outside this building. They're not real excited that Baylor's done what they've done the last couple years. So they're trying really hard to beat us. So we got to do a better job of matching the energy and the mentality and edge that people bring to us.\n\"And that's all on me, 100 percent. And that's something I've worked on the last eight to 10 days.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @ESefko", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ESefko"], "published": "2015-09-22T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:59:47.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
