Hector Amezcua hamezcua@sacbee.com i \ntcouzens@sacbee.com \nThe Kings acquired point guard Darren Collison before the 2014-15 season, and he started 45 games before being sidelined by injury and having surgery. Before this season, the team signed free agent Rajon Rondo, a four-time All-Star who won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008 before also dealing with an injury and surgery. Here’s how the point guards compare (with career averages): \nCOLLISON \n60.9 Head to head \nCollison and Rondo have played against each other eight times in the NBA, with the series split 4-4. Collison leads Rondo in many categories during their matchups, according to basketball-reference.com, including scoring (16.8 to 10.9), field-goal percentage (51.0 to 49.4), three-point percentage (28.0 to 25.0) and free-throw percentage (80.8 to 47.1). But Rondo tops Collison in the most important statistic for a point guard, assists (9.0 to 5.1). In their most recent head-to-head meeting, Rondo scored 21 points and had seven assists to lead the Dallas Mavericks to a 108-104 victory over the Kings. Collison had a good game, too, with 18 points, three assists and seven rebounds. College days \nCollison averaged 11.5 points and 4.1 assists in four seasons for UCLA. Rondo averaged 9.6 points and 4.2 assists in two seasons at Kentucky. Quotable \nKings coach George Karl, after Rondo and Collison started in the backcourt together in last Saturday’s 94-90 preseason victory over Portland: “We haven’t used it in training camp yet, either, just because we’ve been playing against each other more. I can see it being very effective. I thought our ball pressure was better because of it. ... We’re turning the ball over at a high rate, but our defense is also creating a lot of turnovers, so that’s a good thing.” In that game, Collison had 18 points and three assists; Rondo had four points and four assists. \nTom Couzens", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:13:15.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
