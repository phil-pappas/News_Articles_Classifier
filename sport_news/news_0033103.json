He was not issued a ticket, but the trooper asked him to get out of his vehicle to take a photo. \nThat photo was later posted to Michael’s Instagram account with the caption, \"Got stopped just to take a picture.\" A photo posted by Christine Michael (@chrismike33) on Oct 11, 2015 at 10:56am PDT \n“The trooper’s actions have been reviewed by DPS and are not consistent with department procedure,” a DPS spokesperson said. \n“In conversations with his chain of command, the trooper realized his error in judgement and was apologetic for the incident.” \nMichael, who was acquired by the Cowboys a week before the 2015 season, has just two carries for five yards on the season. He rushed one time for six yards during the game after the incident with the DPS trooper. \nHe was a second-round pick out of Texas A&M in the 2013 NFL Draft.
