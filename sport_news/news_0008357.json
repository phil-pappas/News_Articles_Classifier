Stine. \"They were like, 'What is this? Is this supposed to be happening?!' Maybe it was disappointment because they were hoping it would be werewolves and creatures from the movie.\"\nBlack jests, but \"Goosebumps\" is serious business. Publisher Scholastic has sold more than 400 million copies of the dozens of \"Goosebumps\" titles since it launched the series in 1992. It raised a generation of readers on wild-eyed genre fiction, introducing them to age-appropriate mystery, suspense and supernatural occurrences while laying the groundwork for \"Harry Potter\" and other successful YA fantasy and sci-fi series.\nThe impressive reach of \"Goosebumps\" — which includes translations in 32 different languages — would seem to have been established long ago.\nBut on Friday, the first \"Goosebumps\" movie hits theaters nationwide, including a 7:45 p.m. showing at the Alamo Drafthouse Littleton in which Denver author Jason Heller will read from his officially licensed tie-in, \"Slappy's Revenge.\"\n\"It's cool to be part of the whole thing,\" Heller said by phone this week. \"I was too old for 'Goosebumps,' but when I was a kid, I definitely had the Scholastic Book Fairs. Even though my family was super-poor, my mom scraped all her pennies together from her waitressing so I could get all the books I wanted. The name remains a gateway to so many great books and discoveries.\"\nScholastic is banking on that.\nHoping for a comeback\nAs with the Denver stop, last month's unusual \"Goosebumps\" press tour included a school screening and in-person visit from the cast in Minneapolis. An op-ed in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune — noting the promotional T-shirts and posed photos — called it a \"publicity gimmick\"and blatant violation of anti-advertising policies in the district.\n\"Goosebumps\" no longer rakes in the $100 million in annual revenue that it did in its '90s heyday, which led Stine to recently tell the Los Angeles Times , \"It came as a surprise the movie was still alive.\"\nIt would seem natural that Scholastic and Sony would want to reassert the brand with a film version, but the marketing concern may be overstated.\nThe \"Goosebumps\" movie is a good-hearted, clever romp that does its source material (and, improbably, the craft of writing) proud. In the hands of director Rob Letterman (\"Gulliver's Travels,\" \"Monsters vs. Aliens\"), it's more reminiscent of a 1980s sci-fi comedy than a crass marketing pitch for an aging brand.\nFresh-faced Minnette plays Zach Cooper, who has just moved to a small town with his mother (Amy Ryan). Beautiful girl-next-door Hannah (Rush) and her father (Black, as a fictionalized version of Stine) turn out to be inconvenient neighbors as Stine's creations are unleashed on their unsuspecting burgh.\nAlong with Cooper's buddy Champ (Lee), the quartet fights through spooky uncertainty, legitimate jump scares and a bundle of over-the-top, CGI-aided set pieces to save the day.\n\"The whole idea that you can pack almost any type of creature or nightmare or anything that can be remotely terrifying and put it all under the same umbrella is one of the coolest things,\" Heller said. \"Especially for kids — never knowing what the next monster is really (differentiates) it from most kids' horror books.\"\nEmbracing fear\nAt age 18, the film's star, Minnette, was one of those raised on the \"Goosebumps\" brand. He professed to having read 60 of the original \"Goosebumps\" books, calling them \"a big part of my childhood\" on a press day last month at the Four Seasons hotel in Denver.\n\"Part of me wishes, in some strange world, that I wasn't a part of this so I could just see it from the outside, because I know I'd love to feel that excitement,\" he said, joined at a table by Black, Rush and Lee.\nRush added: \"It's a name that you say, and everyone, whether it's parents or children, immediately know what it is.\"\nThe success of the original \"Goosebumps\" books, which include titles such as \"Help! We Have Strange Powers!\" and \"The Blob That Ate Everyone,\" lies in part in its careful balance of scares and humor. It may seem harder to find these days than it was two decades ago, when films, books and other popular culture were less likely to appeal exclusively a single age group.\n\"That was R.L. Stine's main bit of advice, which was 'Make sure you strike the right tone. You can be scary, but you don't wanna traumatize the kids,' \" Black said. \"So we definitely were conscious of that. We'd lean into the funny stuff so it had a good balance. And I tried not to bleed on set.\"\nThe \"safe scares\" that \"Goosebumps\" offers — both in book and movie forms — let young people tangle with real-world issues without traumatizing them, as famously dark kiddie fare such as \"The Dark Crystal\" or \"Watership Down\" did.\n\"It's a rite of passage to be scared,\" said Black, father of two boys, ages 7 and 9, who are square in the film's target demographic. \"It also helps you overcome your fears if you can watch something that's a little bit scary and get through it.\"\nJohn Wenzel: 303-954-1642, jwenzel@denverpost.com or @johnwenzel", "external_links": ["https://drafthouse.com/denver/show/2d-goosebumps", "http://www.startribune.com/jack-black-s-appearance-was-a-publicity-gimmick-for-his-new-movie/330475731/", "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-goosebumps-20150809-story.html", "http://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9780545821254"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:02:58.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
