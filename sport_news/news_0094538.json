In the time since they were borrowed for a high-school speech class, card catalogs have been digitized and classification methods have changed.\nBut the librarians, who no longer charge late fees, say they are thankful that someone returned \"Basic Principles of Speech\" and \"Preface to Critical Reading.\"\nThe anonymous note acknowledges that the books are \"outdated -- yes -- but I'll let you decide their fate now.\"\n___\nInformation from: The Oregonian, http://www.oregonlive.com\nCopyright The Associated Press\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://bit.ly/1RMoPct"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:34:48.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
