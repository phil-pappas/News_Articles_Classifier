Providence (9-0-1, 4-0) is No. 5. \nProvidence has its homecoming with West Mecklenburg in football scheduled for Friday night at 7. \n▪ Hurricane Joaquin has the potential to bring heavy rain to Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday and more heavy rain is expected this weekend. \nIn the Charlotte area, rain chances stand at 60 percent Wednesday night and Thursday, 50 percent Thursday night and 70 percent Friday and Saturday. \n▪ So far only a few high school football games have been affected: Friday’s Mallard Creek at Hopewell game was moved to Mallard Creek, which has a turf field. The teams are trying to protect the grass field at Hopewell, which has absorbed lots of water in the past week. East Mecklenburg’s home game with Butler has been moved to Garinger, which has artificial turf. East Meck-Butler will kick Friday at 7 at Garinger High. \nAlso, two games have been moved to Thursday: Piedmont at West Stanly, 6:30 p.m.; Mount Pleasant at Northwest Cabarrus, 6:30 Notes/Roundup \nProvidence Day field hockey 4, Charlotte Catholic 0: Lily Norris recorded the shutout for the Chargers, who had goals from Grayson Buben, Abby Scully, Celine Ives and Sara Cotsakis. \nSouthLake Christian volleyball raises $1,620 on Dig Pink Night: SouthLake’s middle school, junior varsity and varsity teams recently gave a $1,620 check to Trina Law, wife of Dean of Students and cross-country coach Donovan Law, after hosting Dig Pink Night Sept. 8. That night, SouthLake hosted Concord First Assembly and SouthLake’s players wore pink uniforms and decorated the gym in pink in an effort to raise money for breast cancer awareness. \nThe event was part of a larger fundraiser to support Trina Law, who is batting cancer. The school also plans a 5K and Fun Run fundraiser Oct. 17 . \nNorthside Christian forfeits Friday’s game: Northside Christian has forfeited Friday’s high school football game to Hickory Grove Christian. Hickory Grove will now have a bye and play at SouthLake Oct. 2. Hickory Grove will play at SouthLake Christian Friday. Pine Lake Prep canceled Friday’s scheduled game with SouthLake. \nGreat grab from SouthLake’s Kevin Wharton: Last Friday, SouthLake Christian’s Kevin Wilson made a remarkable one-handed catch in triple coverage. Wharton is a basketball player who decided to play football at the last minute. He moved to the Charlotte-area from Pennsylvania to focus on basketball but SouthLake officials said he is developing nicely as a football prospect. He had five catches for 97 yards last week against Rabun Gap.
