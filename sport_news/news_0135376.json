The players showed appreciation, too.\nBefore Orsillo ended his 15-year tenure as the play-by-play voice of the Red Sox on NESN on Sunday, several players and coaches emerged from the dugout to salute him. The gesture came after the Red Sox’ season-ending loss to the Indians in Cleveland.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n “I thought that was something that we collectively thought would be a very nice gesture for Don,” said Red Sox interim manager Torey Lovullo, via MLB.com . “He means a lot to all of us in different ways, but he means so much to the community and to the Boston Red Sox, and we just wanted to acknowledge him for his hard work and all that dedication.”\nThe gesture did not go unnoticed by Orsillo.\n“Unbelievably, I wave to the Red Sox for the final time. Thank you, boys,” he said as he waved back to the players and coaches who had emerged from the dugout.\n“Orsillo rounding third and heading home.”\nIn a move unpopular with many Red Sox fans, NESN opted to replace Orsillo with veteran broadcaster Dave O’Brien in 2016. Instead of returning to Fenway Park next season, Orsillo will be heading west to join the San Diego Padres’ broadcast booth. The Padres announced on Sept. 30 that Orsillo had agreed to a multiyear deal.\nRed Sox old friends—Former Sox on other teams\nPrevious -- of -- Next The Baltimore Orioles called up former Red Sox catcher Ryan Lavarnway from Triple-A Norfolk in April 2015.
