Of course, holding Delaware State to -33 total yards a few weeks ago definitely helps in that category. 37: Career passing attempts for George Bollas \nThe redshirt freshman could be making his first start under center for the Flashes this week. He came on in relief of Colin Reardon last week and completed 10 of 21 attempts for 77 yards and an interception last week. \n[ LISTEN: UMass Podcast: Kent State preview with the Record-Courier's Allen Moff ] 3,002: Career rushing yards for Trayion Durham \nThe bruising 250-pound senior eclipsed the impressive career mark last week against Toledo. He also has 26 career touchdowns. 3.5: Durham's yards per carry this season \nThe 3,000-yard milestone is nice, but so far 2015 has been Durham's most inconsistent of his career. He's cracked the 100-yard mark just once this season. 5: Interceptions for Demetrius Monday \nThe sophomore corner leads the MAC in picks and is tied for third in the nation. They come in bunches, too, with Monday intercepting more than one pass twice already this season. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:26:08.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
