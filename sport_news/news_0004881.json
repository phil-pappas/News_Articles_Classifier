(AP) - Steve Spurrier will hold what will be his final news conference as South Carolina's head football coach today. \nA person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press the 70-year-old Spurrier let his players know yesterday that he was retiring, effective immediately. It caps a half-century in which he won the 1966 Heisman Trophy with Florida, quarterbacked the first 0-14 team in NFL history, revived a moribund Duke program as a first time head coach, won a national championship with his alma mater and led the Gamecocks to their greatest successes. \nSouth Carolina posted three straight 11-win seasons under Spurrier after never winning more than 10 before his arrival. He went 11-2 as late as 2013, but the Gamecocks followed that with a 6-6 season before opening 2-3 overall this year, 0-4 in the SEC. \nSpurrier was 86-49 with the Gamecocks. He had his greatest success at his alma mater, going 122-27-1 with a national championship at Florida. Spurrier was 228-89-2 in 319 games as a college head coach. \nA person close to the situation says South Carolina co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach Shawn Elliott will be the interim Gamecocks coach for the remainder of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:39:32.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
