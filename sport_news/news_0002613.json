Can they finally turn it around?\nUSA TODAY\nLos Angeles Clippers preview: Looking to take the next step\nWhat’s different this season? The Lakers failed to land any big-name superstars during free agency but helped improve the team in a variety of other ways. They selected D’Angelo Russell with the No.2 overall pick in the draft and signed Roy Hibbert, Brandon Bass and Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams. Not only that, but Kobe Bryant and Julius Randle, the No. 7 overall pick from 2014, will be back from injuries.\nHow good they can be? This lineup is a bit tricky. The Lakers have a lot of talent on the roster, but the mesh of young players with colorful personalities could lead to another season to forget in L.A.\nUSA TODAY\nPhoenix Suns preview: Outside looking in again?\nHow far they have to go: Hibbert needs to not go down the same road as former Lakers bigs Dwight Howard and Andrew Bynum; guards Jabari Brown, Jordan Clarkson, Nick Young and Russell must remember that the Lakers are Kobe’s team; and Williams and Bass need to be as game-changing off the bench as they’re capable. If all that happens, the Lakers could get to 35 wins. Not great, not playoff-caliber, but definitely a step in the right direction.\nBy the numbers: The Lakers ranked 20th or worse last season in field goal percentage, points per shot attempt, assists per game, turnovers per game, turnovers forced per game, points allowed per game and opponent field goal percentage. Bryant won’t let that happen again.\nKobe revival: Bryant has played 41 games combined over the last two seasons and hasn’t played a full 82-game season since 2011. At 37 and going into his 20th season, putting up numbers like he did in his prime is out of the question. But, health permitting, can Kobe be efficient and effective? Looking at most players past 37, the answer would be no. But none of those players were the Black Mamba.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/clippers/2015/10/25/chris-paul-blake-griffin-deandre-jordan-doc-rivers-clippers/72803822/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2015/10/25/eric-bledsoe-brandon-knight-tyson-chandler-alex-len-markieff-morris-suns/72815566/", "http://imgur.com/h0NUN21.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebf1a7a0cbe37ff421bdfb019e9283f02cf642ff/c=864-0-4320-3456/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813931398406879-AP-Warriors-Clippers-Basketball.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/029056a1714d6d9842fdad7f0576cc5a07e0327d/c=1533-0-4813-3280/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813935429784721-USP-NBA--Preseason-Sacramento-Kings-at-Phoenix-Sun.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:06:18.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
