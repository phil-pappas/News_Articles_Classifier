Solomon, who was ineffective over the second and third quarters, re-entered the game and found Baker wide open with 9:17 remaining for his third TD. \nRandall ran 11 times for 81 yards and scored from a yard out with 4:40 left to make it 38-24, which proved the difference when Sefo Liufau found Shay Fields over the middle for a 30-yard touchdown with 2:19 remaining. \nThe Buffs tried an onside kick but Arizona safety Will Parks recovered. They held on fourth down but Arizona downed the punt at the 6 and Colorado couldn't get very far with just 38 seconds to work with. \nThe Buffaloes had to rely on a raw group of linebackers to slow down the Wildcats with Addison Gilliam (leg) and Kenneth Olugbode (leg) out. Last week, junior Ryan Severson injured his right ankle in his first career start, leaving the task Saturday night to freshmen Rick Gamboa and Grant Watanabe. \nGamboa has started the last month in place of Gilliam, but this was Watanabe's first start, and he recorded a big sack of Solomon in the first half. \nBaker burst through a big hole, shot past a surprised secondary and outran defenders for a 79-yard touchdown that gave Arizona a quick 10-0 lead less than five minutes in. But the Buffs replied with a 72-yard touchdown strike from Liufau to Fields moments later to keep it close. \nLiufau was 27 of 42 for 340 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. Solomon was 22 of 37 for 283 yards, two TDs and no interceptions and Randall completed all three of his throws for 42 yards. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:49:49.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
