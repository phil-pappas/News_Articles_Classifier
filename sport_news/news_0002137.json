It is like garbage in, garbage out.\"\nWilner was called as a defense witness on the fourth day of Ronald Pieri's criminal trial before Lake County Circuit Judge Victoria Rossetti. Pieri is being tried on charges of official misconduct, theft and false entry. Charged in 2011, Pieri is accused of falsifying time records and claiming compensation for hours not worked between January 2006 and December 2010.\nWilner testified that the prosecution had simply compared Pieri's time cards with the log-in data on the Highwood Fire Department's computer software, which did not take into account \"non-fraud events\" like days when Pieri was performing administrative duties.\n\"The prosecution's model assumes that if there is a discrepancy between the firehouse software and the time cards, it must be fraud,\" he said.\nBefore Pieri's defense team opened its case Thursday, attorney Julie Trevarthen asked Rossetti to issue findings in favor of her client.\n\"I don't think the state has come close to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Pieri defrauded Highwood,\" she said.\nRossetti denied the request, citing specifically the testimony of former Chief Thomas Lovejoy that Pieri's change from a shift commander to deputy fire chief was \"a title change only\" and he was expected to function as a shift commander on the red shift.\nThe trial is set to resume Thursday afternoon.\nkberkowitz@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter @KarenABerkowitz\nCopyright Â© 2015, Lake County News-Sun Highwood Highland Park", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562930d4/turbine/ct-hpn-highwood-pieri-trial-tl-1023-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:16:08.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
