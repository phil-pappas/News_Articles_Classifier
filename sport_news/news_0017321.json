The Broncos received 234 points, including two first-place votes. San Diego State got 272 points, including 22 first-place votes, as the favorite. \nBoise State senior guard/forward Anthony Drmic and junior forward James Webb III were selected to the preseason first team. Drmic earned a redshirt season after only playing in seven games last season, but is on pace to set the career scoring record at Boise State. Webb was the league’s Newcomer of the Year for the 2014-15 season, averaging 12.9 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in league play. \nAlso on the first team were San Diego State senior forward Winston Shepard, Wyoming senior guard Josh Adams and Fresno State senior guard Marvelle Harris, who also was selected Preseason Player of the Year. He is the only returning player from last season’s all-Mountain West first team. UNLV freshman forward Stephen Zimmerman was chosen the Preseason Freshman of the Year, and New Mexico junior forward Tim Williams, a Samford transfer, was picked as Preseason Newcomer of the Year. \nPreseason Mountain West Media Poll \n1. San Diego State (272) (22 first-place votes) \n2. Boise State (234) (2 first-place votes) \n3. Utah State (190) \n5. Fresno State (182) (1 first-place vote) \n6.
