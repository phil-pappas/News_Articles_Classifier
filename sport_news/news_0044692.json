(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Nolan Arenado hit his NL-leading 42nd home run and broke the major league record for extra-base hits in a season by a third baseman as the Colorado Rockies beat the San Francisco Giants 9-3 on Friday night to end a three-game losing streak. \nCorey Dickerson added his third homer in eight games for the Rockies. Carlos Gonzalez had an RBI single and winning pitcher Kyle Kendrick walked and scored as part of a five-run third inning when Colorado broke the game open. \nArenado homered off starter Chris Heston leading off the fourth, then added a two-run double in the third. That gave the Rockies slugger 88 extra-base hits, breaking Chipper Jones’ single-season record set in 1999. \nKendrick (7-13) benefited from Arenado’s big night to win for the third time since coming off the disabled list on Sept. 1. \nBrandon Crawford had two hits and two RBIs for the Giants. The defending World Series champions have lost two of three since being eliminated from playoff contention. \nColorado had scored more than six runs just twice in its previous 29 road games before its uprising against Heston (12-11). \nThe Rockies scored seven runs with two outs, including a two-run double by Jose Reyes in the fourth, to clinch the season series between the teams. \nArenado provided the biggest spark with his 10th home run against the Giants, the most against San Francisco by an opponent since Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves hit 11 in 1983. \nArenado also became the first NL third baseman with 130 RBIs or more since Vinny Castilla drove in 131 in 2004. \nKendrick, who had lost twice previously to the Giants this season, made it stand up. He allowed one run over five innings and matched his season high of six strikeouts with one walk. \nDickerson’s ninth home run capped the third and put the Rockies up 6-1. Dickerson also doubled and scored on a wild pitch in the fifth. \nHeston gave up eight runs and eight hits in 3 2-3 innings. He lost for the sixth time in his last 11 starts. \nTRAINER’S ROOM \nGiants: OF Nori Aoki will not play again this season and will instead continue his recovery from a concussion. The decision was made after Aoki met with specialist Michael Collins in Pittsburgh for a second time in an attempt to get cleared to play. \nUP NEXT \nRockies: LHP Chris Rusin (6-9) tries Saturday to win for only the second time in 11 road starts this season. \nGiants: RHP Jake Peavy (7-6) has won his last four decisions, including a 7-3 victory over the Rockies on Sept. 5 when he allowed three runs over 5 2-3 innings.
