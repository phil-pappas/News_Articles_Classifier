The two players are known to play a physical brand of hockey, and it wasn't a shock to see them drop the gloves and tangle.\nThe fact that Bieksa immediately jumped in to protect teammate Corey Perry as Clifford was trying to engage the winger following some quick stick-jousting did raise some eyebrows.\nIt was Bieksa who said he couldn't imagine having a drink with Perry in a social setting until the two former longtime combatants did so before training camp.\n“I’ve already talked to him about it and said thank you,” Perry said. “You need that on a team. Guys sticking up for everybody. It’s not just him. There was a few guys out there.”\nDucks general manager Bob Murray has tried to concoct the ideal blend of toughness and skill and the tough part revealed itself against the Kings in an intense affair for the preseason. And it wasn't just the veteran trying to send an early message to his new team.\nYoung defenseman Josh Manson took exception to a hit by new Kings forward Milan Lucic on Chris Wagner. Lucic is a tough customer when it comes to pugilistic skills but Manson more than held his own, leaving the former Boston winger with a cut under his right eye.\nManson called it the longest bout he's ever participated in and said the best way to go about fighting Lucic is to not think about who it is. The message the defenseman wanted to leave was that he is not letting go unpunished an opposing player lining up his teammate.\nEarning respect in the locker room goes a long way on a team.\n“I'll try to be as physical as I can when the time is needed,” Manson said. “Standing up for my teammates, that's an important part of the game. Stand up for yourself and stand up for your teammates. If that time's there, I'm not afraid to do it.”\nAnd while he didn't engage Lucic in a fight, Wagner got his small share of revenge by knocking the burly forward off his feet and into the side boards at center ice. But Bieksa's act left a lasting impression on the Ducks.\n“That’s perfectly what his reputation is as a team player and a leader,” Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said. “That’s what you see when you see that. He sees our best scorer getting tangled with somebody and it doesn’t matter. He just jumps right in and protects him.\n\"Not that Corey needs a lot of protection. But at the same time, that’s what great team giuys do. We’re learning quickly that he’s a great team player.\"\nStill, the irony of Bieksa willing to fight Perry's battle wasn't lost on the coach.\n\"Well, when you think about it, yeah, who would have thunk?\" Boudreau said. “They’re teammates now. That’s one great thing about sports. When you’re teammates, you stick up for each other.”\nNOTES\nLeft wing Max Friberg and center Michael Sgarbossa worked out with San Diego (AHL) on Wednesday but no official assignment to the Gulls had been made, a Ducks spokesman said. ... Defenseman Korbinian Holzer (head) has yet to return to practice after being injured on a hit by San Jose's Frazer McLaren on Saturday. Holzer was at Honda Center sporting a dark ring around his left eye.\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:39:22.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
