Alice Jensen (right) runs in the Autumn Classic. Jensen was named the WCC runner of the month. (Travis Mortenson) \nJensen finished in the top 10 in her first two races this season. \nShe started at the BYU Autumn Classic (3 mile) by finishing 10th overall with a time of 17:47.0, helping BYU win the meet. \nJensen then turned on the jets at the next meet. Her performance at the WCC preview (6k) propelled her to winning the monthly honor. She finished first with a time of 21:18.09 — an entire seven seconds ahead of second place. She led the team to its second first-place finish this season. \n“She came down here and just had the race of her life,” BYU head coach Patrick Shane said in a press release. “She just had an amazing finish. And had she not won that race, we wouldn’t have won the meet.” \nThe Cougars head to Madison, Wisconsin Friday, Oct. 16 to compete in the Wisconsin Invitational.
