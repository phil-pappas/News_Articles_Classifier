It should be. How could it not? His well-being is what's most important.\nNext to that, No. 2 on the list is what the Browns decide to do next. Let him practice? He did practice this week.\nCut him? It's a sensitive situation given that he sought help for an undefined addiction problem less than a year ago.\nBut deactivating him for Sunday is a reasonable middle ground.\nThere's a reason why it made sense the Browns returned to Josh McCown after a concussion against the Jets knocked him out of the game. Maybe we know even more now.\nManziel played three quarters of that game and struggled in a 31-10 loss. He was limited against Tennessee by his own coaching staff and the circumstances of the game but made a late great throw to seal the 28-14 win.\nThe drum beat for him to start and to put McCown out to pasture was predictable, I guess. But it belied what Manziel dealt with over the offseason and what he consistently produced on the field in training camp and in the Tennessee game.\nThe coaching staff showed no hesitation in returning McCown to the huddle. McCown has shown why.\nMaybe Manziel did, too, this week.\nThe Browns should by now know what Manziel's issues are and how he's dealing with them. They should know the fact from the rumors that didn't go away this summer.\nThey hinted at no disciplinary measures in the Farmer statement.\nWe'll see come Sunday. They've made a statement with their reluctance to rely on him in favor of a 36-year old quarterback coming off a 1-10 season.\nSunday, with McCown an injury away from being sidelined, they get another chance.", "external_links": ["http://www.newsnet5.com/sports/police-report-johnny-manziel-pulled-over-during-domestic-argument-admits-to-drinking"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:23:21.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
