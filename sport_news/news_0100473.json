Barrett?", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "PISCATAWAY, N.J. -- If you go back and watch the play closely, Braxton Miller actually missed catching the ball. It passed through his hands and hit him on his belt buckle.\nBut as he fell to the ground, the ball luckily bounced high off his left knee, hit the defender in the chest, then landed right in his arms.\nIt's the latest Miller highlight that's going into his still-growing collage of crazy plays he's made as a wide receiver. The play, which occurred late in the first half of Ohio State's 49-7 win over Rutgers, is right up there with the spin move from Virginia Tech.\nMiller deserves credit for making the play. Staying coordinated enough to track the ball with a defender falling on top of you is hard, but there had to be some luck involved.\n\"At first I lost it in the air because I had to slow down,\" said Miller, acknowledging that J.T. Barrett's pass was a little under-thrown. \"He put his arms up and I lost it completely. But I was in a good position and used my senses to catch the ball.\"\nThere's something special about Miller, an innate ability to make explosive things happen on the football field. And, like is the natural inclination, many draw conclusions as to how quickly he's developing as a wide receiver based on this highlight-reel worthy explosions.\nThere's some validity to that.\n\"Nothing surprises me with Braxton,\" offensive coordinator Ed Warinner said after the game. \"I've been watching him do that now for four years.\"\nBut it's not the whole thing.\n\"Of course, like with anyone, there's things he needs to do better,\" Warinner said.\nHere are some thoughts:\n• Can he and J.T. Barrett co-exist in this offense? That may seem like a weird question, but think about it. The most integral thing Miller probably still needs to learn is how to block at a very efficient level consistently, and now the Buckeyes are in a more run-oriented offense behind Barrett, so there's an even bigger need for premium blocking.\nUrban Meyer said after the game that they are pleased with Miller's progression.\n\"I am very pleased with the way he's blocking and the way he's catching the ball,\" Meyer said of Miller. \"He's really getting good at his route-running. I'm very excited for him.\"\nBut how good is Miller at blocking, really?\nHaving watched him closely the last few weeks, he certainly has made plays without the ball. But there are other instances where he doesn't look that solid blocking, which may make it harder for Miller and Barrett to be on the field together as much.\nCould that be a problem?\n\"We're always going to have a perimeter run game,\" Meyer said. \"I think I get your question. He has to be a good blocker regardless.\"\n• Touches are an issue: Miller used to touch the ball every play when he played quarterback, but the game he had against Rutgers is probably the reasonable benchmark of expectation for the remainder of his career. A handful of touches, a touchdown and a spectacular play a game? The Buckeyes will take it, even if Meyer keeps saying they want him to touch it more.\n\"He had three touches,\" Meyer said. \"I wish he had more.\"\n• Meyer is committed to Miller: Though Miller's transition from quarterback to receiver is still happening, there are going to be some hiccups along the way. But Meyer is committed to getting Miller ready to be a receiver in the NFL.\n\"We're doing the best we can with him,\" Meyer said. \"Two months ago, just getting lined up and getting in a stance (was a challenge). We are so committed to getting that guy (ready). He's done so much for this program. I am very pleased with the way he's blocking and the way he's catching the ball. He's really getting good at his route-running. I'm very excited for him.\"\n• Is he really an NFL receiver? Miller's quickness and innate ability to make plays like the one he did against Rutgers makes him an interesting topic for NFL executives. Meyer said Miller, with his skills at receiver right now, is NFL ready.\n\"I'm very pleased with him,\" Meyer said. \"I think he can certainly play receiver at the next level. He's that close right now.\"\nReally? Is he that close to being a legitimate wide receiver?\nMaybe. But if you want to see a real NFL receiver prospect -- one of the best in the country -- take a look at Miller's teammate and close friend, Michael Thomas.\n• He's special: At times it may seem as if it's easy to be hard on Miller, and maybe sometimes he gets a bad wrap. But that's only because he's such a gifted talent, one of the best college football has seen in a decade.\nSo you want to see him touch the ball more. You want to see him on the field. You want to see him co-exist with Barrett.\nPlayers like Miller are what make college football fun.\nAnd his playmaking ability? That's not cliche. There's something there that just cannot be taught.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mf5bADvAVwI"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:58:39.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
