White slideshow KENNESAW — After scoring five runs in the top of the seventh to stun Cherokee in Wednesday’s Game 2, Harrison’s offense continued to roll Thursday in a 5-1 win to clinch the second-round Class state playoff series at Clackum Field.The Lady Hoyas lost Wednesday’s first game 1-0 and trailed 4-3 in the top of the seventh of the nightcap, but they rallied to win 8-5 and force Thursday’s elimination game.Harrison carried its momentum over into the early innings of Game 3, scoring a two-out run in the first inning and adding three more in the second to build a 4-0 margin.Cherokee had at least one hit in every inning, but it delivered its only run in the top of the fifth as Harrison pitchers Emily Kachel and Pierce Fox, along with the Lady Hoyas’ defense, kept the Lady Warriors at bay.Region 4 champion Harrison (25-6) moved on to the elite eight tournament in Columbus for the fourth year in a row, while Region 5 No. 3 seed Cherokee (27-7) saw its season come to an end short of the state finals for the seventh straight season.“It was important for us to get those runs early and continue to establish the momentum we built from Game 2, scoring late, into scoring early this game,” Harrison coach Matt Jones said. “That helped our pitchers settle down and our defense to stay loose and focused.”Jaiden Fields put Harrison on the board in the first when her two-out single scored Maddie Davenport.After Lindley Bruce led off the second with a home run — her third of the season — Gabby Malafronte singled and Summer Swanson reached on a throwing error. Davenport then laced a two-out double to right-center to score Malafronte and Swanson for a 4-0 lead.Abby Broome hit a two-out solo homer — her fifth of the season — in the top of the sixth after Cherokee trimmed its deficit to 4-1 in the fifth.“Big hits have been the M.O. of our offense,” Jones said. “We hit six to eight home runs in the region tournament and a couple (Thursday). There’s isn’t a space in our lineup where you can relax. Our girls are clutch up and down the lineup. It’s what we expect every game.”Cherokee was able to get on base, totaling nine hits, including two for extra bases, but the Lady Warriors stranded runners in scoring position in the first, second, fourth, sixth and seventh innings.Cherokee finally broke through in the fifth as Macy Martinez walked and scored on Autumn Bible’s one-out double.Martinez was 2-for-3 with a run scored, while Taylor Cates was 2-for-4 with a stolen base and Kindell Reeves batted 2-for-4.Reeves allowed five runs — four earned — on six hits with one walk and four strikeouts.“We came out tight and (Harrison) jumped on us, which made us press even more,” Cherokee coach Tonya Carlisle said. “Harrison’s a good team. They have the experience and they’ve been in this position before.”Davenport batted 2-for-3 with two doubles, a run scored and two RBIs for Harrison. Kachel gave up one earned run on eight hits and struck out three in 4 1/3 innings. Fox allowed two hits through 2 2/3.“I’m glad we’re going to Columbus because (Wednesday night) was a scare,” Broome said. “We came in knowing we were going to win and, if we play loose and not get tight, I think no one can play with us.”Jones was also happy to advance.“It never gets old getting to Columbus,” he said. “It’s never easy, and we don’t take it for granted, but it’s an honor to make it back and represent our region and the county.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:53:06.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
