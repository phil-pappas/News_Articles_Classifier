(AP) - The latest on the American League Championship Series between the Blue Jays and Royals, which began Friday night in Kansas City (all times local):\n5:20 p.m.\nThere was some thought that David Price would start Game 1 of the ALCS for Toronto, but manager John Gibbons went with Marco Estrada on regular rest instead.\nThat's led to another round of questions about how Price has been used.\nThe former Cy Young winner has a shaky playoff record, and wasn't particularly good in his start against the Rangers. So rather than rest him to start a potential ALCS opener, Gibbons used him in a 50-pitch relief stint that made him unavailable for Friday night.\nPrice is scheduled to pitch Game 2 against Kansas City on Saturday.\nGibbons said it was simply a matter of circumstances, and while he acknowledged Price pitched longer than most people thought he would, \"that was a little bit of strategy, too.\"\nAsked about the way he'd been used, Price replied: \"It doesn't matter. Whatever the team wants me to do to help them win. I'm all about it.\"\n___\n4 p.m.\nRoyals manager Ned Yost wishes he had listened a bit more to John Gibbons when his Toronto counterpart was on his staff a few years ago.\nMaybe he'd have learned something to help the Royals in the ALCS.\nAfter Gibbons was fired by the Blue Jays in 2008 in his first go-around as their manager, he was hired that October by then-Royals manager Trey Hillman as a bench coach. Gibbons stuck around when Hillman was fired in May 2010, working for Yost through the 2011 season.\nAsked about those years together, Yost acknowledged before Game 1 on Friday: \"I didn't take full advantage of Gibby when he was here. At the time I was still a little on the hard-headed side and managed the game all by myself.\"\nGibbons said he harbors no ill will over their time together.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
