Enlarge... \nTroy, N.Y. — The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) golf team has played well in its first four matches, thanks, at least, in part, to the play of a pair of former Waldo County high school golfers. \nThere are seven golfers on the Engineers, including Belfast Area High School graduate Jamie Jackson and Mount View High School graduate Erik Larrabee. \nIn four recent matches, the Engineers finished fourth among seven teams on Sept. 26 at the Liberty League Championship in Potsdam, N.Y,, third among 25 teams on Sept. 20 at the Duke Nelson Invitational in Middlebury, Vt., 11th among 18 teams on Sept. 12 at the Flower City Preview in Rochester, N.Y. and 11th among 16 teams on Sept. 6 at the Transylvania Fall Invitational in Lexington, Ky. \nIn the Liberty League Championship, Jackson tied for 13th as he shot a two-day total of 153 (80-73) and Larrabee 20th with 157 (82-75), while in the Duke Nelson Invitational, Jackson tied for 13th as he shot a two-day total of 155 (81-74) and Larrabee 33rd with 158. \nIn the Flower City Preview, Jackson tied for 15th as he shot a two-day total of 152 (79-73) and Larrabee tied for 67th with 163 (83-80), while in the Transylvania Fall Invitational, Jackson finished tied for 33rd as he shot plus-nine (225) over the two-day tourney (Larrabee's final numbers for the Transylvania Fall Invitational were unavailable). \n“Golf at RPI has been an awesome experience,” said Jackson, the team's senior captain. “It's been an opportunity to build and excel my game.” \nJackson, of Belfast, was an All-American last year having won four of the 10 tournaments he competed in. \n“He's struggled a little bit this year mostly because he's putting too much pressure on himself,” said RPI associate athletic director Kevin Beattie, who works closely with the team. “Once he realizes he doesn't have to win every single tournament and be the leader of the team as he is as a captain, his game has rounded into the form we saw last year.” \nLarrabee, of Jackson, who was on the team last year but, as a sophomore, has played his way into competition, has been a “pleasant surprise,” said Beattie. \n“He has shown poise and shown ability to be able to compete on our team and we like to think we have one of the best teams in the Northeast, if not the country,” Beattie said. “Eric has adapted really well to college golf and he's shown it.” \nLarrabee, an Aerospace Engineering major who graduated from Mount View in 2014, played four years of golf and baseball for the Mustangs and finished fourth in the Maine Principals' Association schoolboy championships his senior year. \nJackson, a Biomedical Engineering major who graduated from Belfast in 2011, qualified for the schoolboy championships all four years in golf, finishing tied for sixth as a freshman, second as a sophomore and tied for fourth his junior and senior seasons. \nJackson said he and Larrabee have grown close over the years since their high school times toiling against one another in rival Waldo County high schools. \n“We're very close friends and it's been a fun experience shifting our mindsets from being competitors to teammates,” he said. “We still have lots of pride being college golfers coming from Belfast and Jackson, Maine.” \nJackson named Liberty League performer of week \nJackson continued his stellar start to the season as he was named the Liberty League performer of the week. \nAt the ECAC Division III New England Golf Championship on Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 10-11 at The Ranch in Southwick, Mass., Jackson fired 77 and 70 for a two-day total of 147, which earned him a fifth-place finish in the 69-player field and all-tournament first-team honors. \nThe overall score was Jackson's best performance of the season. \nA fourth-year varsity performer for the Engineers, Jackson was a National All-America and a CoSIDA Capital One National Academic All-America — the first golfer in school history to achieve that — after averaging 75.73 strokes over 19 rounds and capturing four events, including three straight as a junior. \nHe competed in all 10 matches as a junior, earning medalist at the Duke Nelson Invitational (74-72) at Middlebury College, the Williams Fall Invitational (70-75) at Williams College and the Liberty League Fall Qualifier (season-best 72-70), hosted by the University of Rochester. Those victories all came in consecutive weeks in September of 2014. Jackson later won the Fred Kravetz Invitational (72-74), also hosted by Rochester, in the spring semester. \nHe was recognized by the Liberty League with four weekly performer-of-the-week awards and an All-Academic certificate. He also captured ECAC golfer of the month once and was named to the GCAA Division III PING All-Northeast Region before landing on the GCAA National All-America honorable mention list. \nIn his first two seasons, Jackson played in 19 matches, earning a victory at the 2012 ECAC New England Division III Championship with an overall score of 152 (76-76) and a runner-up finish at the Palamountain Invitational (76-71) in 2014. He also had five other top-10 finishes, earning the league's rookie of the week award once and All-Liberty League second-team honors as a freshman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:30:13.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
