I hit my driver great and my wedges were good. It's awesome to sweep. Two years ago we also did that.\" \nThe other four AAA boys golfers advancing to the PIAA East Region tournament are Nazareth senior Nick Atherholt (77), Pocono Mountain West senior Tim Gaudette (77), Nazareth junior Kevin Scherr (77) and Emmaus senior Kevin Caverly (78). Harrington, Fedele and Atherholt advanced to the regional event for the second straight year. \nRiding the fine play of Harrington, Fritzinger, Caverly and junior Eric Cichocki (78), the Green Hornets won the third consecutive District 11-AAA team title by a 305-320 score over Nazareth. \nEmmaus was the undefeated regular-season Eastern Pennsylvania Conference champions. Nazareth won the EPC league tournament, the program's first championship since 1998. \n\"Our top players played well, and we got the fourth score we needed,\" said Emmaus coach Mike Mihalik, who has won four District 11 team championships in his seven years at the helm. \"This was Eric Cichocki's lowest round of the year. I was wondering what the fourth score would be. That was fantastic.\" \nEmmaus advanced to play in a PIAA Class AAA East Subregion match against District 12, to be conducted on Friday at Lulu Country Club in Glenside, Pa. \nDISTRICT 11 GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS \nSchuylkill Country Club (par 72) \nFinal 18-Hole boys Class AAA scores PIAA AAA East Region qualifiers (6) 73 -- Max Harrington, Emmaus (1-over-oar)75 -- Paul Fedele, Easton77 -- Kevin Scherr, Nazareth; Tim Gaudette, Pocono Mountain West; Nick Atherholt, Nazareth78 -- Kevin Caverly, Emmaus79 -- Alec Cwienkala, Parkland; Jacob Siegfried, Liberty80 -- Brian Whelan, Pocono Mountain East81 -- Nick Hinkle, Nazareth; Bailey Sophy, Blue Mountain; John Yocum, Freedom82 -- Brian Frey, Stroudsburg84 -- Thomas Coakley, Saucon Valley85 -- Victor Tavares, Nazareth; Ian McBrairty, Easton86 -- Tanner Cook, Blue Mountain87 -- Donald Lecompte, East Stroudsburg North; Sean Abel, Freedom88 -- Thomas Lakata, Central Catholic90 -- Trevor Buss, Nazareth; JP Balas, Pocono Mountain East; Alex Albenzi, Southern Lehigh; Chris Toleno, East Stroudsburg South91 -- Michael Miller, Southern Lehigh92 -- Jimmy Gold, Southern Lehigh; Derek Barnes, Southern Lehigh98 -- Mike Kovalchik, Northampton \nFinal 18-Hole Girls AAA Scores PIAA AAA East Region qualifiers (2) 76 -- Samantha Fritzinger, Emmaus (4-over-par)95 -- Rachel Brahler, Pottsville", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:38:16.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
