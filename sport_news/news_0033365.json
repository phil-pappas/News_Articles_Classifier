It was Oscar Smith's 79th consecutive victory over a Southeastern District opponent.\nOn the opposite side of the field, Oscar Smith's bench went ballistic - dancing and cheering for all they were worth.\n\"I saw it coming short and just took it,\" White said. \"I just couldn't believe it. Oh my God. We just never gave up and it was so open down the line.\"\nIt wasn't final until Cameron Lester's extra point, but with 24.7 seconds left, it was hard not to go crazy.\nThe Braves had all but smothered Oscar Smith for the entire game. That left the matter to the Tigers' special teams, which were able to make things interesting and victorious at the end.\nOscar Smith scored the game's first two points when Jahmeek Jones blocked a Braves' punt for a safety. But Indian River scored the game's next 14 points to take command.\nOscar Smith's comeback started when the snap for an Indian River punt sailed over the head of punter Jalen Williams, setting up a Tigers touchdown.\n\"There are three phases in a game... 48 minutes, not three quarters,\" Duke said. \"He fielded that punt in full stride and hit it like he told me he would.\n\"That's manning up and never giving up.\"\nLee Tolliver, 757-222-5844,\nlee.tolliver@pilotonline.com\nTwitter: @LeeTolliver\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
