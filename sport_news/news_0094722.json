Now the Bulldogs are 5-2, 3-2 in the SEC, unranked in the AP poll and 25th in the coaches poll with star tailback Nick Chubb out for the season with a left knee injury. \nGeorgia still has a big goal in front of it can reach, winning the SEC Eastern Division and getting to Atlanta for a shot at the league championship. \nThe latest bowl projections have the Bulldogs ending the season in the Outback Bowl in Tampa (ESPN.com, SportingNews.com), TaxSlayer Bowl in Jacksonville (SI.com and CBSSports.com) or Music City Bowl in Nashville (USAToday.com). \nLet’s take a look back and a look ahead for the Bulldogs before the Florida game week is here: \nHIGH POINT \nIt may be hard to remember, but South Carolina had Georgia’s number heading into their game in week three. The Gamecocks won four of the last five in the series, but quarterback Greyson Lambert helped make what turned out to be Steve Spurrier’s last game against Georgia a 52-20 Bulldogs blowout. Lambert set an NCAA completion percentage record by going 24 of 25, but has lacked consistency this season. Georgia’s 32 first downs were the most by an SEC team this season. \nLOW POINT \nOn the first offensive snap at Tennessee, Georgia saw its worst case scenario play out when Nick Chubb went down with a gruesome left knee injury. He’s done for the season and required surgery. Mark Richt said this week he is “optimistic” that Chubb will play in 2016. Chubb tied Herschel Walker’s Georgia record of 13 straight 100-yard rushing games before his injury. Chubb still had the third most rushing yards in the SEC (747) entering this weekend. \nAREAS OF IMPROVEMENT \n(Compared to after week 7 last year) \nPunt returns. From 34th in the nation to 20th. Georgia is averaging 14.55 per return. Isaiah McKenzie returned a punt 77 yards for a touchdown and Reggie Davis 70 for a touchdown. \nRed zone defense. From sixth in the SEC last season (81.0) to second (73.7). The highlight was the goal-line stand against Missouri after it had the ball at the 1-yard line following an interception. \nPassing offense. Well at least as far as yardage, Georgia is actually up from 110th in the nation (171.3) to 78th (213.9). Lambert threw for 330 against Alabama, 279 against Tennessee, but just 117 against Vanderbilt and 86 against Alabama. \nSacks allowed. From fourth in the SEC (1.43) to second (1.14). Left tackle John Theus leads an offensive line that has not given up more than one sack a game in five of seven games. \nAREAS THAT SLIPPED \n(Compared to after week 7 last year) \nKickoff return. From 20th nationally at 24.4 yards per return to 126th at 15.5. Another special teams dropoff is at net punting which has dipped from 37.61 to 33.64. \nThird down offense. From 47th nationally at 43.2 percent to 109 th at 33.3. Georgia’s overall completion percentage has dipped to 63.0 from 68.1 \nTurnover margin. From tops nationally at 1.86 to 64th at 0.14. Georgia has seen lost turnovers grow from four to nine and turnovers gained fall from 17 to 10. \nScoring offense. From seventh in the nation (43.4) to 49th (33.1). Georgia has slid from tops in the SEC to seventh. Time of possession has slid from 30:01 to 27:52. \nMARK YOUR CALENDAR \n(Besides the Florida game) \nNov. 14. Auburn. The return to the Plains puts Tigers safety Tray Matthews against his old team. Georgia goes back to the scene where it lost on its last trip on the “Prayer at Jordan-Hare,” a 43-38 heartbreaker to the Tigers two years ago. \nNov. 21. Georgia Southern. It will be Senior Day for players including John Theus, Kolton Houston , Jordan Jenkins, Marshall Morgan and Malcolm Mitchell. It will also be the collaring ceremony for Que, who becomes Uga X, taking over for the retiring Russ. \nNov. 28. Georgia Tech. Imagine if Georgia wins the SEC East and goes to Atlanta to play say a 4-7 Yellow Jackets team who can win their second straight in the rivalry. Think that won’t make their season? \nVICTORY MILESTONES FOR RICHT \nAfter moving past Wally Butts to No. 2 on Georgia’s all-time win list with 141, Mark Richt is now ninth on the SEC all-time victory list. \nHow many more does he need to move up? \n11: To tie Phillip Fulmer of Tennessee at No. 8 with 152. \n32: To tie Robert Neyland of Tennessee at No. 7 with 173. \n60: To tie Vince Dooley as Georgia’s all-time wins leader with 201, which is third in the SEC. \nMVP SO FAR \nWith apologies to Nick Chubb who would have gotten this award if he wasn’t injured, wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell is the midseason MVP. \nFor an offense challenged in the passing game, Mitchell has returned to form pre-knee injury. The senior entered the weekend tied for the SEC lead in touchdown catches with four, seventh in receiving yards per game at 72.1 and ninth in receptions per game at 5.0. His 35 catches are 10 off his career high and he is on pace to finish in the top five in receiving yards in program history for a single season. He also was the player on punt coverage that forced a key Missouri fumble in Georgia’s win last week. \nAT LEAST IT GOT A GOOD TV RATING \nThe highest rated CBS game so far heading into this weekend was Georgia-Alabama on Oct. 3. \nIt was the eighth highest rated game of the season. Only Ole Miss-Alabama on ESPN on Sept. 19 on ESPN drew a better rating among SEC games, according to ESPN/ABC. Georgia lost 38-10. \nSTEPPING UP \nJake Ganus. The UAB inside linebacker transfer leads Georgia with 50 tackles, which ranks 15th in the SEC, is tied for the team lead in interceptions with two and has a sack and fumble recovery. \nSony Michel. The sophomore tailback accounted for 729 all-purpose yards with 508 rushing, 187 receiving and 34 on kickoff returns. He’s third on the team with 16 catches and second in receiving touchdowns with three. \nTrenton Thompson. The heralded freshman defensive tackle quietly has 21 tackles, two and a half tackles for loss and two quarterback hurries. He has started the last four games. \nMISSING FROM ACTION \nLorenzo Carter. The former five-star outside linebacker recruit has no sacks or tackles for loss in seven games. He has 12 tackles. \nGeorgia’s tight ends. Jeb Blazevich has six catches for 62 yards after having 18 for 269 as a freshman. Jay Rome and Jackson Harris each have three catches for 45 yards. \nSCOUTING REPORT ON FUTURE OPPONENTS \n(Statistics entering weekend) \nFlorida’s turnover margin. Sixth in the nation and tops in the nation with 14 gained and five lost. \nPatrick Towles’ passing yards. The Kentucky quarterback averages 252.0 yards per game. That’s better than any quarterback Georgia has faced this season. \nAuburn’s defense. Under first-year coordinator Will Muschamp, the Tigers are 94th in the nation in total defense, allowing 426.2 yards per game. The Tigers are 100th in run defense, giving up 197.7 yards per game. \nGeorgia Tech’s third down conversion percentage. The Yellow Jackets are converting only 32.9 percent of the time (114th in the nation). Georgia Tech carried a five-game losing streak into a Saturday night game with Florida State. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:56:55.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
