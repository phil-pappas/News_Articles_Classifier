Though Willis should return in time for Kentucky's exhibition games next month, coach John Calipari expressed disappointment that the 6-foot-9 junior will miss Sunday's televised open practice. \nSaid Calipari in a statement, \"he deserved to show his stuff tomorrow. He's made great strides and will bounce back from this.\" \nWillis played in 19 games last season and has 33 career appearances with the Wildcats. He is expected to add depth to a Kentucky frontcourt that lost four players to the NBA draft. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:32:46.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
