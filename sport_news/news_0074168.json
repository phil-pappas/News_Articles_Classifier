That's 20 feet longer than a typical bus.\nOfficials say the transportation authority has contracted to buy up to 18 buses, which will be used on straight routes throughout Albany.\nCDTA officials say the agency had similar buses in the 1980s, but today's technology is better.\nNewly installed camera systems have improved visibility for drivers in respect to the rear of the buses.\nInformation from: Times Union, http://www.timesunion.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1LocJSi"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:33:23.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
