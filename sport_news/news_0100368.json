It was always going to be that way but we've got a crack at it next week,\" said New Zealand captain Richie McCaw, who now has the chance to become the first man to hoist the Webb Ellis Cup twice. \n\"We've been saying they would bring everything. There were no surprises and we had to dig deep to get the result.\" \nSouth Africa led 12-7 at halftime through the goal-kicking of Handre Pollard but spent most of the half defending. \nThough they offered precious little in attack all match and kicked badly out of hand the Springboks somehow clawed their way back to within two points with more penalties to set up a nail-biting last 10 minutes. \nNew Zealand, however, showed all their vast experience to run down the clock and give themselves the chance to become the first country to retain the title. \n\"We believed we were good enough to beat them but we just weren't,\" said South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer. \"We wanted to make our country proud and we didn't.\" \nThe holders ended the game deep in the South African half as they chalked up their 11th, and most important, victory in their last 13 meetings with their greatest rivals. \nNEW ZEALAND 20 (Jermoe Kaino, Beauden Barritt tries; Dan Carter 2 conversions, 2 penalties) bt SOUTH AFRICA 18 (Handre Pollard 5, Patrick Lambie penalties) \nSunday sees the second semi: Australia v Argentina, Twickenham, Sunday, 4pm Ghana time. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
