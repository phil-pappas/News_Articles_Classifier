He also ran for a score. It was the fourth most passing yards allowed by Baltimore in franchise history. Cleveland had lost 13 of its past 14 games against the Ravens, who fell to last place in the AFC North.\n\"Sometimes you get wins that define things for you, that become a turning point, and we're hoping that was this for us,\" Cleveland coach Mike Pettine said. \"We did a lot of bad things, but we found a way. That's what this league is all about.\"\nBaltimore blew a fourth-quarter lead for the fourth consecutive game and fell to 1-4. The Ravens suffered a major blow to any postseason hopes. Only 10 of 206 teams (5 percent) that started 1-4 since 1970 have made the playoffs.\n\"Obviously, it's a disappointing loss -- one that should not have happen,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"Give the Browns credit. They made the plays when they needed to make them. That's on is.\"\nBrowns tight end Gary Barnidge caught eight passes for 139 yards with a crucial touchdown for Cleveland (2-3).\n\"We knew it was going to be one of those huge passing games,\" Browns left tackle Joe Thomas said. \"They were trying to blitz us and take away the running game.\"\nAfter their offense stalled late in the first half, the Ravens opened a 21-9 lead when quarterback Joe Flacco lunged over the goal line for a 1-yard score midway through the third quarter.\nMcCown then rallied the Browns with a 10-yard touchdown run on the ensuing drive. After the Browns forced the Ravens to punt, McCown found Barnidge, who managed an 18-yard catch, using his legs to secure the ball, giving the Browns their first lead, 22-21 with 12:21 left in the game.\nBaltimore took advantage of a short-field and retook the lead on a 1-yard run by running back Justin Forsett with 5:56 left in the game. Forsett finished with 121 yards on 21 carries. He was out of the game early in overtime with a right ankle injury.\nBut once again, McCown delivered. This time, McCown hit Isaiah CrowelI for a 22-yard touchdown with three minutes left. Baltimore got down to the Cleveland 5-yard line, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Justin Tucker with 29 seconds remaining.\n\"We won a lot of games against these guys down the stretch like that,\" Flacco said. \"We were not able to do it obviously, our record speaks for itself and what kind of challenge it is. I've never been in this position before.\"\nThe Ravens went three-and-out on the first possession of overtime. The Browns then marched down the field to set up the game-winner by Coons.\nA little closer than you'd like, but the outcome certainly was fitting and we'll take it,\" McCown said. \"This is a special win. I hope it gives us momentum going forward.\"\nCleveland entered the game ranked 31st, allowing 141.5 yards per game. The Ravens, however, leaned on Flacco for most of their offense. Flacco threw consecutive passes to wide receiver Jeremy Ross before scoring from the 1-yard line on a bootleg. Flacco then hit fullback Kyle Juszczyk for an 8-yard score and the lead was 14-3 with 16 second left in the opening quarter. Browns kicker Travis Coons managed field goals from 43 and 37 yards that cut the Ravens' lead to 14-9 at the half.\n\"It's tough, man,\" Forsett said. \"We want to win games, but we have to keep fighting. We can't feel sorry for ourselves.\"\nNOTES: Ravens WR Steve Smith is listed as \"week-to-week\" with microfractures in his back. Smith, however, was not officially ruled out against Cleveland until the day of the game. ... Browns CB Joe Haden (broken finger) was back in the lineup after missing last week's game against San Diego. S Tashaun Gipson (ankle), however, remained sidelined. ... Baltimore RB Lorenzo Taliaferro (foot) was a late scratch after being listed as probable with foot injury. That left the Ravens with Justin Forsett and Buck Allen as their only healthy running backs.\n  Cleveland Browns add Josh McCown Cleveland Browns-Baltimore Ravens preview: Keys to the game and who will win Mike Pettine: Josh McCown 'firmly' starting QB Oakland Raiders: 3 things we learned after road win over Cleveland Browns", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:11:22.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
