It starts with bringing in the right coaching talent, players development and the right scouts. It's very hard to put a time frame on to, but we're in a hurry. I'm not a patient person. I've never been a patient person. I hate to lose. When we lose, I don't have a good time.\"\nHarris called it a \"big big offseason. Lots of change. The commencement of the Ray Shero era in hockey for the Devils with 100 percent support of ownership and the ending of Lou's (Lou Lamoriello) era, though we wish him well in Toronto... (It was) saying of goodbye to some old faces and bringing in some new faces, all of which we're very excited about.\"\nCo-owner David Blitzer, who has kept a low profile in recent months, did not attend the state of the team press conference. Harris said the Devils are fifth in the NHL in terms of new tickets sold, but he would not offer any statistics to back up his claim.\n\"We have a ways to go to be selling this place out every night,\" CEO Scott O'Neil said of Prudential Center. O'Neil said renewals were 90 percent.\nHarris said former president and general manager Lou Lamoriello would be invited to the Feb. 9 ceremony to retire Martin Brodeur's No. 30.\n\"The relationship with Lou is great. There was no animosity on either side,\" Harris stressed. \"In fact, Lou made a very human decision to go a different direction with his career and we supported that and he supported us. For sure Lou will be invited to that ceremony. It will be up to him whether he attends.\"\nHarris also said it was not a fair description to say the Philadelphia 76ers have \"tanked\" in order to get higher draft picks and said that will not be the case with the Devils.\n\"I don't think that is a fair characterization of what's going on at the Sixers in terms of what we're doing to rebuild the team. I think the two situations are very different,\" he said. \"I think hockey is very different than basketball. The ability of one player to make huge difference in basketball is larger than it is in hockey. Hockey is very pouch a team game and the parity of teams is much closer. I know people want to draw that analogy, but I don't think it's really appropriate.\"\nNew Jersey Devils players arrive for season opener via red carpet New Jersey Devils fans watch as player arrive along a red carpet outside the Prudential Center for their season opener against the Winnipeg Jets Oct. 10, 2015. (Video by Saed Hindash | NJ Advance Medai for NJ.com)\nGoalie matchup\nCory Schneider (26-31-9, 2.26 goals-against average, .925 save percentage) vs. Michael Hutchinson (21-10-5, 2.39 GAA, .914 save percentage).\nSchneider needs three wins to reach 100 for his NHL career. His 2.14 GAA since coming to the Devils is the lowest in club history, even lower than 2.24.\nHutchinson was second among rookie goalies last season with 21 wins.\nDevils' new entrance to ice on hold\nThe Devils will be changing dressing rooms from the main game day room in Prudential Center to their practice locker room that leads out to the ice in AmeriHealth Pavilion at some point early this season.\nHowever, they remained in the regular game day room for Friday night's home opener because construction is not yet complete on the route from the practice facility to the ice.\nThe move to make the practice dressing room the Devils' game day room is designed to have the team walk past fans on their way on and off the ice. Players will have to walk up a few steps coming out of the dressing room and take a slightly longer route to the ice.\n\"It doesn't bother me at all. It will be pretty fun, I guess,\" goalie Cory Schneider said. \"Change up the look and maybe have the fans interact with you a little more on the way out. Kind of like college.\"\nInjuries\nDevils: LW Patrik Elias (right knee).\nJets: D Grant Clitsome (upper body).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:52:02.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
