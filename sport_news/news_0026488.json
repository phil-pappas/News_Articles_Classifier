This offensive line is trying to prove everybody wrong.’’\nIt is not only the offensive line, but it is a good place to start. The ascension into first place in the NFC East five games into the season is not fooling anyone, especially not the Giants. They are feeling good about themselves, as any team riding a three-game winning streak should, but it is impossible to detect even a trace of swagger.\nFor all the occasional talk that 3-2 could actually be 5-0 if not for the late-game meltdowns the first two weeks, there is also the admission the 30-27 comeback victory over the 49ers could have gone the other way, given the wasteful nature of the offense in the red zone and the queasy feeling the defense triggered with another fourth-quarter show of futility.\nThis is quite likely the life the Giants have chosen this season, and if there is one group able to rise above and become a consistent source of strength, it is the offensive line. A few weeks ago, when the story line centered on the big, bad, big-bucks Bills defensive front, right tackle Marshall Newhouse pointed out the Giants invested plenty on their offensive line. Indeed, there are two first-round picks — Ereck Flowers and Justin Pugh — one second-round pick in Weston Richburg and a free-agent signing (Geoff Schwartz) who was targeted prior to the 2014 season. Newhouse, a veteran new on the scene, is in the starting lineup only because Will Beatty (a former second-round pick on a $38.75 million deal) is out with a torn pectoral muscle.\nThere is no doubt about Eli Manning’s ability to take the team up and down the field — a career-high 41 completions against the 49ers was a friendly reminder. Manning sets the protections so wisely and patiently — although watching the play clock nearly expire always gives fans agita — that the fact he’s only been sacked four times in five games is a credit to his self-preservation as much as the pass blocking in front of him. In this Ben McAdoo offense, Eli doesn’t hold onto the ball as long as he used to, and that makes a big difference.\nThe way these Giants are built, their defense is going to have to hold on for dear life and hope Manning can produce 27 to 30 points. Chase Utley will be elected mayor of New York City before the Giants can dust off a legitimate pass rush. They desperately need Robert Ayers to return from a hamstring injury — this could be the week — and perhaps find some lightning in a bottle with rookie Owa Odighizuwa. Nothing is going to come easy with this defense, though.\nIn Week 6 a year ago, the Giants, winners of three straight, took the short ride to Philadelphia and were blasted by the Eagles 27-0. The season-ending loss of Victor Cruz was the physical devastation, but the mental scars of that terrible performance stayed with the Giants for months.\nWeston Richburg Photo: Getty Images In that game, Pugh had a hand in allowing six of the eight sacks on Manning, including three to Connor Barwin. Immediately after he was dominated, Pugh was clearly shaken.\n“There isn’t even a word to describe how badly I played,’’ he said glumly.\nRichburg never struggled so mightily in a game as a rookie, but his first year with the Giants in 2014 was nothing special, lined up at left guard even though he was considered perhaps the best center in the draft. A year later, at home at center, Richburg is a steady fixture at the heart of the line.\n“I think that having a year under my belt and then moving to center has definitely helped,’’ Richburg said. “My maturation’s come a long way.’’\nFlowers is a keeper, a rare rookie who is not overwhelmed at all. Schwartz has come back from serious ankle surgery and is what the Giants thought he was when he was signed last year to a $16.8 million contract — a massive, heady guard to complement those around him. Newhouse, brought in to be a versatile reserve tackle, was forced into the lineup when Beatty got hurt while lifting weights. Beatty is eligible to begin practicing next week and could be off the physically unable to perform list and back in action before midseason. What tackle spot he lands in is up for debate.\nMonday night serves as a huge test for the offensive line, facing an aggressive Eagles defensive front that already has 11 sacks — four from Fletcher Cox, who will line up opposite Flowers, taking aim at Manning.\n“It would be nice if we could run the ball and take a little heat off [Manning], that’s something we got to definitely work on,” Pugh said.\nFor Pugh, it is a return to the scene of his worst football crimes, as he bottomed out in the shadow of his hometown —he’s from Holland, Pa., a Philly suburb. It is also a return to where Richburg last season was called for an unnecessary roughness penalty, jumping on Cox well after the whistle.\n“That’s football,’’ an unrepentant Richburg said not long after the game. Tom Coughlin did not agree. “I don’t buy it,’’ the coach said, and Richburg a day later changed his tune.\n“That wasn’t a smart move,’’ he conceded.\nA year later, again in Week 6, Pugh and Richburg will again be at Lincoln Financial Field, expecting more from themselves, their offensive line and everyone else in Giants blue.\n eli manning , ereck flowers , geoff schwartz , justin pugh , marshall newhouse , new york giants , weston richburg", "external_links": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/weston.jpg?w=244&#038;h=300", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/weston.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:17:58.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
