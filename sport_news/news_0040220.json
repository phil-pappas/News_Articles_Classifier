Those deals included stripping and performing sex acts, Powell told the program. \nOne Louisville player recruited by the university told ESPN one party felt “like I was in a strip club.” \nAnother former Louisville player said McGee had given him US$1 bills to tip dancers. \nLouisville head coach Rick Pitino said he was unaware of the stripping and sex parties, urging McGee to address the allegations. “Not myself, not one player, not one trainer, not one assistant, not one person knew anything about any of this,” the Hall of Fame coach said. “If anyone did, it would have been stopped on a dime. Not one person knew anything about it.” \nPowell, 42, has written a book detailing the allegations, entitled “Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.” The book alleges nearly two dozen parties took place between 2010 and 2014 at a campus dorm. \nLouisville’s athletic department declined to comment directly on “Outside the Lines,” saying in a statement it was withholding a formal response to “preserve the integrity of the review process.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:20:29.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
