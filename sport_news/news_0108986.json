The Patriots cornerback made that huge play and became a household name, and then over the offseason, he also became the No. 1 cornerback on his team thanks to the departures of several players ahead of him.\n\nThe latest from SportsLine Week 7 NFL Picks \n\nWatch any New England game this season and if you focus on Butler, you're likely to see that he's tracking the opposing team's top wideout across the field for most of the game. That practice, along with his play in a blowout last season, has earned him the respect of the player he seems fairly likely to track this Sunday: Jets receiver Brandon Marshall .\n\"He came in and did a great job vs. Alshon [Jeffery] on a couple of plays in that game,\" Marshall said Friday, referring to last year's Patriots-Bears game, per ESPN . \"I was a little shocked. I was like, 'This kid can play a little bit.' I overlooked him when he was standing in front of me. He made a few plays and I'm like, 'This kid can be special.'\"\nButler has been decent to start the season, but considering he's been matched up with players like Antonio Brown , Sammy Watkins , Allen Robinson and Donte Moncrief for many of his snaps, decent seems pretty good for an undrafted free agent thrust into the No. 1 role. Per Pro Football Focus tracking, he's been targeted 35 times in seven games, allowing 21 catches for 349 yards, four scores and a pick. Of those 21 catches and 349 yards, Brown had 9 for 133, though; so the other three players (plus Dallas wideout Terrance Williams) have combined for just 12-216, which makes Butler's play look a bit better.\n\nMalcolm Butler has earned Brandon Marshall's respect.
