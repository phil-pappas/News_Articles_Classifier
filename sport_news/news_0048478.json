Henry, the league's fourth best rusher, finished with 95 yards and one TD on 27 carries. Collins, third in the SEC, gained but 26 yards on 12 carries.\nPregame buzz: Alabama's 38-10 road domination of Georgia Oct. 3 re-started the Crimson Tide's engines after a Sept. 19 turnover-filled home loss to Ole Miss. Arkansas had momentum after breaking a three-game losing streak with 24-20 victory at Tennessee.\nPostgame fallout: Alabama is one of three remaining SEC teams unbeaten in league play, joining LSU atop the West Division.

Sony Michel, Chubb's backup, responded with 145 yards on 22 carries vs. the Vols.\nMoving on: Georgia, which dropped from polls, is at home against Missouri, the two-time defending East champs. Tennessee has an open date.\nQuote: to note: \"\"No, we don't get down. It's not really in our DNA. Like the maxim says, if at first the game or the breaks go against you don't let up.\" – Tennessee LB Jaylen Reeves-Maybin\nFlorida 21, Missouri 3\nRecords: Florida 6-0, 4-0 East; Missouri 4-2, 1-2 in East.\nStoryline: With two starting freshman quarterbacks, the game evolved into an old-school SEC defensive battle. Florida redshirt freshman QB Will Grier threw for 208 yards for the Gators, but was sacked five times by a Mizzou defense that forced six three-and-out drives and nine punts overall.\nNotable numbers : Missouri was 1-for-14 on third down conversions, getting its lone conversion in the game's last minute.\nPregame buzz : Florida's 28-27 victory over Tennessee Oct. 3 raised eyebrows, but its 38-10 whacking of No. 3 Ole Miss made the Gators legit. Missouri was extremely encouraged by its 24-10 win over South Carolina.\nPostgame fallout: First-year Florida coach Jim McElwain liked the way his defense played. \"They are fun to watch when they focus and don't get silly,\" he said. \"And what do I mean by that? Sometimes they lose focus on the prize, the prize being what we do on Saturdays, and I haven't seen much of that lately.\"\nMoving on: Florida, now No. 8 in the AP and No. 11 in the coaches polls plays at unbeaten LSU. Missouri travels to Georgia in a series where the home team has lost the last three years.\nQuote: to note: \"The game of football is based on downs. The money down is third down.

I just need to relax and play football.\" – Ole Miss wide receiver Treadwell\nMississippi State 45, Troy 17\nRecords: Mississippi State 4-2; Troy 1-4.\nStoryline: Quarterback Dak Prescott played just three series because of a stomach virus, but State led 21-0 when he exit, thanks to his 59-yard TD pass on the second play of the game, a TD fumble recovery and a TD punt return.
