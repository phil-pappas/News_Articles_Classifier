His methods have been justified in his results with Dortmund, where he has won two Bundesliga titles and took the team to the finals of the Champions League. \n\"In his first year he said he wouldn't guarantee anything apart from that when we reached 120km per game then it would be much harder for us to lose,\" Owomoyela said, as quoted by the Mirror . \n\"He actually offered us a day off when we reached that target. He thought that if we reached that then we would win the game. And from then on it became easy because we understood that his plan would work,\" the former midfielder added. \nKlopp has taken over from Brendan Rodgers, who failed to live up to the club's lofty expectations and was shown the door following their 1-1 draw against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. The German manager will preside over his first game as in charge of the Liverpool squad against Tottenham Hotspur this weekend, but is still waiting to meet the entire team, who are out on international duty. \nJames Milner, who has impressed for Liverpool so far, is expected to be a key figure in Klopp's plans ahead in the season, while other players would have to buckle up and abide by the manager's strategy. \nMeanwhile, Tim Hoogland, another player who spent a year under him at Mainz has insisted that his theatrical attitude on the touchline, chugs players on and takes them to a level to offer their best on the pitch. \n\"You've seen it in the past when he's standing in the technical area, he can go really crazy. But on the other hand, I think it can give extra motivation. He pushes you to a really, really high level,\" Hoogland said.
