For most anyone else, getting to the inn takes a bit longer.\nThe Willows Inn, you see, is on Lummi Island, Wash., a forested patch of land roughly half the size of Manhattan, located about two-and-a-half hours by road and ferry from Seattle. The experience of visiting the Willows, thanks to the relative isolation of the inn and the transcendental quality of the food, has been likened to a pilgrimage—albeit one that concludes with flaxseed caramels rather than mere enlightenment.\nWhen Mr. Wetzel, a native Washingtonian, moved to Lummi after three years of cooking at Noma in Copenhagen, he was blown away by the wild fecundity of the island and its surrounding waters. “I thought it would just be a great, beautiful place,” he said. “Then I got here and started to taste food better than anything I had ever tasted. I actually had to kind of relearn a lot about food. I’d been working at the greatest restaurant in the world, but it was like I’d never tasted a melon.”\nENLARGE NORTHWEST PASSION | Squash and apples from the garden. Photo: Kyle Johnson for The Wall Street Journal Mr. Wetzel knows the price of having “a very small restaurant on an island in the middle of nowhere”: Very few people will be able to experience his food in person. That’s why he and writer Joe Ray put together the lushly photographed cookbook “Sea and Smoke: Flavors From the Untamed Pacific Northwest,” to be published Oct. 27 by Running Press. It documents a year of cooking on the island (Mr. Ray moved there for the project). The recipes—for dishes such as herring roe on kelp with charred dandelions, and halibut skins wrapped around clams and rolled in seaweed—are complex in ways that Mr. Wetzel’s cooking at home is not. The simplicity he strives for there serves as a useful counterweight to the restaurant’s ambitions.\n“By living here, I find that I spend a lot more time just noticing things, sitting on the beach, looking at the stars, eating great food and kind of...being here,” he said. “And that’s nice.”\nThe best feature of my kitchen is: the view of the ocean and the sunset over the counter top.\nENLARGE Blaine Wetzel’s books. Photo: Kyle Johnson for The Wall Street Journal I spend a lot of my time: reading cookbooks. Right now I’m super into this book called “Preserving the Japanese Way.” It’s Nancy Singleton Hachisu’s second book. Both that and her first book, “Japanese Farmhouse Cooking,” are stunners. There’s a real wealth of information there. I’m finishing the Benu cookbook, though I read that mostly when it came out. Also, “ Alexandre Gauthier: Chef, La Grenouillère,” which is incredible, right down to the binding.\nThe person who cooks most in this kitchen is: my fiancée. She does the cooking at home. Her mom cooks and cleans relentlessly when she’s here. It’s really nice to have the company. One dish that her mom makes all the time: Paraguayan tortillitas, little fried breads with cheese that are super good.\nAt home I like to cook: simply. Last night I had broccoli, some sort of dip and an ear of corn. I’m not going to spend a day off cooking, though sometimes I’ll get inspired by a recipe that I read. Like, when the Pok Pok cookbook came out, I was so into that. I would hunt down ingredients and make Thai dinners.\nFor breakfast, I usually have: some fresh juice, toast with butter and cheese, and tea or coffee. I like to order different teas—that’s a whole world to get into. Right now I have this awesome aged pu-erh tea that’s about five years old. It was given to me by the tea sommelier at Atera [in New York], Jeff Ruiz. We usually have a loaf of bread left over from the night before, and if there’s a piece of cheese, like the one from my last trip to Italy—that, to me, is a really nice breakfast.\nThe kitchen tool I couldn’t live without is: a good knife. I have several that are very significant to me—either made for me specifically or given to me by mentors. Each one has its own significance beyond functioning like bad-ass ninja swords. I have one that was given to me by René Redzepi on my last day at Noma. It’s a very special knife that he had gotten in Japan. Another was made by this legendary knife maker named Bob Kramer, who is a god of knifemaking in the U.S. He came and ate at the restaurant, and was kind of touched by what we did, and so he made a knife based on the measurements of my hand. The handle is made from a piece of wood from our previous farm.\nMy favorite way to cook is: over fire, whether in the smoke house, over the hearth, over some embers, in some embers or wrapped in foil next to the fire.\nI love it when my dinner guests bring: a musical instrument. It’s great when you share food with somebody, and they share music with you.\nIf I weren’t a chef, I’d love to: have a winery around Dundee, Oregon. Being a winemaker in the Willamette Valley would be awesome. That would be a dream job. I’m envious of winemakers sometimes. They can literally bottle their work and then taste it later. Whereas, lots of times, I’ve had perfect nights, and cooked perfect dishes that will come and go in a few minutes and never be seen again.\n‘ ‘By living here, I find that I spend a lot more time just noticing things.’ ’\n——Blaine Wetzel In my pantry, you’ll always find: a variety of salts. We make salt at the restaurant, but I also like to use this finishing salt from Sitka Alaska, made by a friend of mine named Jim Michener. The ocean water it comes from is so clear, you can watch a coin drop a hundred feet.\nIf I’m not cooking, I’m: working on other projects I have going on around the house. Like making miso, or doing sake or plum wine or hard cider or kombucha. I’m constantly working on those types of things, but not so much on things like holiday hams.\nAn ingredient I’m using a lot of right now is: apples. This was a crazy fruit year. Just outside, I have an apple tree that’s abundantly fruiting. These particular apples make a great, pink cider. They’re just starting to fall, so I hope we’ll be pressing soon.\n—Edited from an interview by Matthew Kronsber", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH967_WETZEL_FR_20151005134437.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH969_WETZEL_FR_20151005134927.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:32:27.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
