Macomb freshman Maya Stovall took first place overall in the girls race with a winning time of 19 minutes, 28 seconds. \"For the people who finished, compared to where we were three or four weeks ago when we were here, we were a lot quicker â€” boys and girls both,\" Macomb coach Randy Ames said. \"I was really happy. We ran some great races today.\" Macomb senior Isabel Wohlstadter did not run on Tuesday in the girls race and then No. 2 runner Maggie Swanson had to drop out of the race on Tuesday because of asthma. In the team standings, Liberty won both the boys and the girls races. The Bomber girls finished fifth as a team scoring 105 points. Emma Wohlstadter was 16th with a time of 21:53.22. Lydia Fetene (27, 24:41.88), Joey Trost (28, 24:42.83) and Courtney Neavear (33 26:01.97) rounded out Macomb's scoring. The Bomber boys finished second, scoring 47 points. Liberty won the meet with 33 points. Noah Pyles led Macomb, finishing fourth with a time of 17:34.76. Zach Zahnle finished seventh in 17:46.92 and Alex Dranes was 10th, finishing 18:15.03. Each were all-conference. Dakota Shepler was 12th with an 18:46.46 and Josh Cook rounded out Macomb's scoring, finishing 14th with a 19:01.49.
