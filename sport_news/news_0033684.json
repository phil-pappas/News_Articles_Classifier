They were 4-0 when the roof was closed midway through a game.\nPopular hockey personality Don Cherry was among the Jays fans miffed that the roof was closed. He went so far as to call it an anti-Canadian measure taken by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.\n\"I think it's a Canadian conspiracy, that Commissioner Manfred has against Canada, that he has this dome closed,\" Cherry said during the pre-game show of the game's broadcast. \"It's a beautiful day outside, what's the hell's the sense of having a dome?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:56:01.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
