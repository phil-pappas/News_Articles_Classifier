On a day when the Dynamo celebrated their 10th season, the hometown fans must have felt nostalgic when Ricardo Clark scored off a Brad Davis centering pass on Sunday afternoon.\nAdChoices Clark and Davis, both original Dynamo players, have combined on plenty of goals over the last decade. In the early years of the franchise that meant conference championships and MLS Cup titles.\nThis season, however, Clark's tally will be the last scored at BBVA Compass Stadium. In front of 20,145 fans, the Dynamo and Seattle played to a 1-1 draw - a result that eliminated the Dynamo from playoff contention.\nHouston (11-13-9, 42 points) will play its final regular season match at Vancouver on Oct. 25.\nThough extremely dire, the Dynamo's playoff chances still were alive as the game reached the final 10 minutes Sunday. They were dashed for good when Obafemi Martins awkwardly headed in a corner kick that bounced through a couple of near post defenders.\nClark gave the fans clad in orange hope in the 65th minute when he scored his career-best eighth goal of the season.\nDynamo midfielder Luis Garrido intercepted a pass in the attacking third and passed wide to Davis. Davis centered it to Clark, who was wide open at the top of the penalty area. Clark hit a low and bouncing shot through several defenders at the far post.\nGoalkeeper Tyler Deric provided one more masterful save in the 89th minute when he dove seemingly from nowhere to rob Clint Dempsey of a shot that curled around the wall on a free kick.\nCorey Roepken is a freelance writer.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:54:59.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
