There isn't much to discuss about the 48-21 victory on Atlanta's side. The team came out and developed a commanding lead early without ever looking back.\nEarlier in the week, Texans' star player J.J. Watt had this to say about Matthews', the former A&M lineman, via NFL.com\n\"It's always difficult to make that transition into the league, but I think [Matthews] has handled it well. He's very athletic. He's a guy obviously with a great pedigree. He stands on his own, he makes some great blocks and I think he's worthy of the praise they give him.\"\nChicago Bears: Martellus Bennett, TE: Bennett caught 11 passes for 83 yards and a touchdown in the Bears last second victory over the Oakland Raiders.\nChicago improved to 1-3 and earned its first victory of the season after a last second field goal gave the team a 22-20 edge.\nDenver Broncos: Von Miller, LB: Miller is known for being a comedian, but Teddy Bridgewater of the Vikings probably found little to be humorous after Miller and the Broncos defeated Minnesota 23-20.\nMiller picked up his second sack of the season. Last week, he was fined for his sack celebration which reminded many of a well-known Key and Peele skit. Miller had more to say about the sack dance to The Denver Post\nHouston Texans: Shane Lechler: Lechler is all that remains on the Texans' roster for the Aggies after Kicker Randy Bullock was cut earlier in the week in favor of former San Diego Charger Nick Novak.\nLechler averaged 48.5 yards per kick on four punts Sunday against the Falcons in the blowout loss.\nMiami Dolphins: Ryan Tannehill, QB: The Dolphins had higher hopes for the 2015 season. That's why they play the game.\nMiami dropped to 1-3 after losing to Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Jets at Wembley Stadium. On Monday, the Dolphins fired head coach Joe Philbin. Reportedly, issues are beginning to get more serious in practice, with Tannehill allegedly telling players to \"enjoy your practice squad paychecks\" according to multiple reports.\nNew York Giants: Damontre Moore, DL: The New York Giants are back at .500 for the season thanks to a 24-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Week 4.\nThe third round pick out of A&M had three tackles, two solo, in the victory.\nPittsburgh Steelers: Cody Wallace, OL: It took until overtime, but the Baltimore Ravens scored their first victory of the year, holding the advantage in a 23-20 contest with the Steelers.\nWallace, the starting center, and the rest of the Pittsburgh squad fall to 2-2 after the defeat.\nSan Diego Chargers: Josh Lambo, K: In a game against the Chargers and the Cleveland Browns, this might not be the former Aggie you'd expect making headlines.\nThe most accurate kicker in Texas A&M history continues to find success at the next level, even if it takes a little luck.\nAfter missing what would have been a 39-yard field goal that sent the game to overtime, Lambo got a do-over from five yards closer thanks to an offside penalty. He booted the pigskin 34-yards for the win and moved the Chargers to 2-2.\nNo, Manziel did not start. The Browns fall to 1-3.\nSan Francisco 49ers: Tony Jerod-Eddie, DL: In a 17-3 loss to the Green Back Packers, Jerod-Eddie logged a tackle on the stat sheet. San Francisco was unable to stop Aaron Rodgers and the Packers offense while struggling with offense itself. The 49ers fall to 1-3 while Green Bay remains perfect at 4-0.\nSeattle Seahawks: Michael Bennett, DL: The Detroit Lions made it close with a fourth quarter TD that brought the score to 13-10, but Michael Bennett and the Seahawks defense was able to hold on for the victory.\nKam Chancellor, Strong safety and former holdout for the Seahawks' earlier this season, forced the fumble which led to Seattle's victory.\nBennett feels Chancellor deserves a raise.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: Mike Evans (WR) and Jorvorski Lane, RB: Evans was much more quiet on the stat sheet this week rather than last, accounting for three catches and 37 yards in the 37-23 loss to the Panthers.\nLane also appeared in the contest.\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://news.yahoo.com/dolphins-ryan-tannehill-reportedly-told-175401570.html", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13819756/pay-michael-bennett-seattle-seahawks-says-behalf-teammate-kam-chancellor", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000546582/article/jj-watt-jake-matthews-worthy-of-praise", "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/10/04/von-miller-reacts-to-sack-dance-fine-with-more-dancing/35847/", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland"], "published": "2015-10-06T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:02:06.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
