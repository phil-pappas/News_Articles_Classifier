In a postseason that's already had its fair share of absolutely monstrous home runs (looking at you, Yoenis Cespedes), none has been quite as important as Bautista's on Wednesday night. Nor has any single home run caused so much outrage. After Bautista went yard, he unleashed arguably the most triumphant bat flip you'll ever see. Take a look for yourself: Unsurprisingly, a celebration like this caused serious outrage around the baseball world, as many players and spectators felt that Bautista's bat flip was unnecessary and unclassy. Here's Rangers pitcher Cole Hamels weighing in: Dyson, who surrendered the homer, accused Bautista of disrespecting the game . \"Jose needs to calm that down, just kind of respect the game a little more,\" Dyson said after the game. \"He’s a huge role model for the younger generation that’s coming up playing this game, and I mean he’s doing stuff that kids do in Wiffle ball games and backyard baseball. It shouldn’t be done.\" Curt Schilling, on ESPN afterward, said he understood Bautista's emotion but also said he hoped Bautista would be ready to get hit next season when the two teams faced each other. Others felt that Bautista's celebration was totally deserved. Former Blue Jay Joe Carter seemed to have the most reasonable (if also biased) stance on the whole matter. Now remember, the Jays haven't been in the playoffs since 1993. They trailed 0-2 in the series, and in Game 5 they quickly fell behind 2-0. After Toronto rallied to tie the game, the Rangers took a controversial 3-2 lead in the top of the seventh, as Rougned Odour scored from third on the Unintentional Interference Rule: When the Jays' catcher went to throw the ball back to the mound, it accidentally careened off Shin-Shoo Choo's bat and went dribbling down the third baseline, allowing Odour to race home. The umpires reviewed the play (and reviewed it again), and after they upheld the run Toronto fans started belting trash from the stands onto the field in protest. Had the Jays not rallied and the Rangers had held on to win, it would have been one of the more controversial clinching games in recent baseball-playoff history.
