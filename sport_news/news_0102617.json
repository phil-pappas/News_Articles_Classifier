Ratchanok employed her trademark deceptive shots and Saina had no answer to them. She was not good at net-play and movement, too.\n\nThis allowed Ratchanok to snatch eight points on the trot to hold an 18-5 lead and later win 21-9.\n\nShe continued the momentum in the second game and dominated Saina from the outset. A 4-0 lead at the beginning meant Saina always trailed her. Ratchanok stamped her authority to race to an 11-5 lead at the break.\n\nSaina played a bit better after the break. She collected 10 points - the same as Ratchanok - after the break.\n\nBut there was not stopping the three-time former world junior champion Ratchanok as she pocketed the second game 21-15 and entered the semi-final.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:34:34.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
