Then you think that there’s hundreds of thousands of other kids that wish they could be in our situation, playing college basketball, playing for BYU.”\nNate Austin\nPROVO — Forward Nate Austin appreciates another shot to play for BYU.\nThe 6-foot-11 senior played in just a handful of games last year before suffering a hamstring injury, after dealing with an ailing back.\nAustin is feeling healthy and is happy to be back with the Cougars.\n“I definitely learned from sitting out and seeing things from the bench. I’m grateful just to be able to play,” he said. “There are times at practice when you’re tired and you wish practice would be over. Then you think that there’s hundreds of thousands of other kids that wish they could be in our situation, playing college basketball, playing for BYU. So for me to be able to play and be healthy is an honor and a blessing. I’m grateful to coach (Dave) Rose and the staff who gave me another chance to come back and play.”\nWhat does Rose like about having Austin on the team?\n“His presence, his leadership. Nate is the one guy you don’t ever worry about his effort. His effort is going to be there,” Rose said. “Sometimes you worry about him getting into foul trouble because he is so physical and so active. You’re going to get his best effort every time he steps out there.”\n“I love rebounding, I love to play hard and give my all to the team,” Austin said. “The biggest thing I bring is experience.”\nOn the team’s summer trip to Spain, Austin played well, averaging seven points and 6.3 rebounds per game in four contests.\n“In Spain, my back and hamstring felt great,” he said. “But after back-to-back games, my knees hurt. It was tough for my knees to get warm. My knees feel good now. Right now, I’m playing pain-free.”\nAustin is considered a walk-on this season, since scholarships were already promised to newcomers to the program.\nSuffice it to say, he’s just glad to be playing basketball again.\nSCHEDULE NOTES: After hosting a pair of exhibition games on Oct. 30 and Nov. 7, BYU will open the season at home against Utah Valley and first-year coach Mark Pope.\nPope served as a Cougar assistant for four seasons.\nOther highlights of the non-conference schedule include road games at Long Beach State, Utah and Colorado. BYU will travel to Hawaii for three games at the Diamond Head Classic on Dec. 22, 23 and 25.\n“I’m very happy with our nonconference schedule,” Rose said. “We play some very strong teams that will prepare us for the conference season and for postseason play. We’ll be tested, especially with some very difficult games away from home. I’m excited about our team and can’t wait to get started.”\nThe Cougars tip off West Coast Conference play Dec. 31 at Saint Mary’s.\nROSTER BREAKDOWN: BYU has three seniors on this year’s team — guard Kyle Collinsworth, forward Nate Austin and guard Chase Fischer; one junior — forward Kyle Davis; four sophomores — forward Jamal Aytes, guards Cory Calvert and Jake Toolson and forward Corbin Kaufusi; and seven freshmen — guards Nick Emery, Zac Seljaas, Jordan Chatman and Cooper Ainge; center Alan Hamson and forwards Jakob Hartsock and Braiden Shaw.\nSophomore guard Elijah Bryant, a transfer from Elon, is sitting out this season due to NCAA transfer rules.\nEMAIL: jeffc@deseretnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:04:10.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
