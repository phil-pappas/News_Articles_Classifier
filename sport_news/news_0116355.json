Advertisement FOOTBALL: Kingwood secondary preparing for Atascocita’s playmakers By Matthew Costa mcosta@hcnonline.com   \nThere’s plenty to look forward to when Atascocita (7-1, 3-1) and Kingwood (5-2, 3-0) meet in their annual rivalry game this   \nBoth sides are loaded with talent, but one of the key matchups going into the game that could be the difference is Kingwood’s defense, particularly its secondary, against one of the best receiving corps in District 16-6A, and quarterback Daveon Boyd. \nComing into Friday’s game, Atascocita has three receivers with at least 25 receptions, and seven who have caught at least two touchdowns in the first eight games of the 2015 season. Boyd is the catalyst for the offense however, racking up 2132 yards and 28 touchdowns to just four interceptions. \n“They have a good receiver squad over there, a good quarterback, but we feel like we have a better team and we’re going to take it,” said Kingwood cornerback Josh Slayton. “It’s going to take a lot of preparation; a lot of film, and a lot of practice. \n“They execute almost to perfection so it’s tough to counter that. A lot of preparation and we should be able to get it done.” \nThe main threat for Atascocita is 6-foot-4-inch Coye Fairman, who has put up a ridiculous stat line of 39 receptions for 714 yards and 11 touchdowns through eight games, good enough for tops in the district. \nKingwood counters with a secondary that has plenty of experience itself. The senior Slayton lines up opposite of junior Cole Preston takes on the duties of the other corner starting corner with a senior at safety to help in coverage. \nStill, the experience of Kingwood doesn’t concern Boyd too much given his own skill players’ time on the field. \n“I’ve got seniors out there too that are working real well,” he said. “I’ve got some tall guys, so that helps a lot. I just throw the ball out there, and they make a great play on it.” \nGiven that Kingwood hasn’t lost a single game since starting 0-2 to undefeated Katy and Klein Collins, while giving up an average of 20 points per contest, it appears the Mustang defense has been on point. \n“They fly to the ball real well as a team,” Boyd said. “If you throw the ball out, the whole team’s going to be there, not just one person. We’ve just got to execute against them.” \nIt’s obviously not going to be just another game when the Eagles line up against the Mustangs, considering how much is on the line between them, and not just in the standings. \n“It’s huge,” said Slayton. “It’s probably going to guarantee that playoff game. We’ve lost to them the past two seasons so this is a big game. We need to come out and get the win, keep us perfect in district, but it’ll be a tough one.” \n“We need to come out and show them this is our area,” Boyd said. “We’ve been playing so well, it feels like we’re making a statement; making a name for ourselves. To keep it going against a team that’s doing real well this year would be good for us.” \nThere will be many talking points coming out of this highly anticipated game that will have huge ramifications in the pecking order of Distrcit 16-6A come the end of the season, but a major one will be Kingwood’s back four against the explosive players in Atascocita uniforms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:23:24.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
