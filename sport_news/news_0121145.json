The Eagles are also down to their third tight end.\n“For us it’s just a matter of doing our jobs and it doesn’t matter who is back there,” said Bowen. “That’s our goal every week, to execute and do our job a high level so they can do what they do.\n“The job doesn’t change. It’s really just us executing no matter who the quarterback is running the offense. It’s not a totally different mindset, we want to do what we do up front.”\nRead option quarterback Darius Wade suffered a fractured ankle in the Eagles’ 14-0 loss to No. 9 Florida State on Sept. 18 at Alumni Stadium. BC coach Steve Addazio platooned backups Troy Flutie and Jeff Smith in last Saturday’s 17-14 victory over Northern Illinois.\nFlutie is a roll-out passer who can run, while Smith is better with his feet. Flutie will start against Duke but will relinquish control of the huddle to Smith. The deployment will depend on the flow of the game and the harsh weather conditions that are predicted to hit the Carolinas this weekend.\n“They are doing their thing and it is exciting and we are doing our thing and we are ready to take this show on the road down to Duke,” said Bowen.\n“For us it doesn’t matter who is back there but you do get comfortable with certain guys in the huddle and how they communicate. But whoever is calling the plays is going to call the plays and we have to do our jobs.”\nAddazio prefers a power run offense but lost the horsepower to operate it. Featured tailback Jon Hilliman suffered a fractured foot after gaining 119 yards against Northern Illinois.\nTailbacks Myles Willis and Marcus Outlow missed practice with shoulder injuries and their status remains uncertain. That leaves junior Tyler Rouse as the only healthy ball carrier with ACC game experience.\n“We never know who is back there until we see them running past us,” said Bowen. “We’ve got a lot of talent but it doesn’t change because we have to block them up front and that’s what we want to do every week.\n“We have a great group of backs and I know coach (Al) Washington will have them ready to play. They are a bunch of great guys and that’s really exciting and Tyler has always been a special kid.\n“We have to let him do what he does. We are going to have to run the ball and that’s what we do every week and that’s no different.”\nThe 6-foot-7, 290-pound Bowen will be occupied by Duke’s rotating right ends Kyler Brown and Britton Grier, two seniors who can seal the edge and harass the quarterback. Duke has the No. 10 ranked defense in the nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:26:54.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
