I have still yet to get nasty,” Yenni said in response to the FOX 8 News reporter interviewing him.\nAn ad Lagasse is running suggesting Yenni changed his last name from Maunoir to his mother’s maiden name, and that of his late grandfather for political expediency is not off limits. His grandfather the late Joe Yenni was Parish President in Jefferson before his death.\n\"I just think when people go to vote they should know who they're voting for, what their qualification are, before I go cast a vote for someone I want to know who that person is,” said Lagasse.\nYenni believes the attack goes too far.\n\"My parents had a divorce way back when almost two decades ago, and that's when I chose to take my mom's maiden name, my mom raised. I lived with my grandmother Lucille Yenni, my mom is Peggy Jo Yenni and it was a decision I made. It has no place in this campaign,” he said.\nEven though the consent judgment bars the candidates from running the ads in question, there are no guarantees the race will not turn ugly in other ways.\n\"It depends on what he does, but I do believe we will do some positive stuff, but I still think the people need the know the whole story of Mike Yenni,” Lagasse stated.\n\"I have no reason to, I don't like negative campaigning,” said Yenni.\nBoth said they have the best experience to run parish government’s administration.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
