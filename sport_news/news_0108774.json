Her daughter Sanaya is kidnapped from a school race, and she is told that her that if she wants her daughter back, she will have to defend a convicted felon, a rapist and a murderer Miyaaz Shaikh (Chandan Roy Sanyal). She is warned not to go to the cops because the abductor will be closely watching all her moves. Anuradha's cop friend Yohan (irrfan Khan), a suspended policeman, finds out about the abduction and decides to help her. Anuradha has to race against time to save her daughter. All she has are four days.\n#MustRead: dna 'Jazbaa' review: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan makes a strong comeback with perfect whodunit\n1) Firstpost: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is sincere, but she needs a better director than Sanjay Gupta (Critic: Gayatri Gauri)\n\"​ Jazbaa has great potential as a potboiler thriller dealing with the country’s most significant issue of rape. But all its focus is on how well Rai screams, cries and runs. Next, it is about how Irrfan Khan playing a corrupt cop-Yohaan- delivers entertaining dialogues (by veteran Kamlesh Pandey) like.. “Rights? Hindustan mein rights nahin hote..”. Sometimes Khan recalls he needs to throw in some action too. So he kicks and smashes some roadside props. If the two together are not being dramatic enough, there is Shabana Azmi, playing a dead victim’s mother, at her melodramatic best.\"​ Read the full review here .\n2) NDTV: Jazbaa Movie Review (Critic: Saibal Chatterjee)\n\"As Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Irrfan Khan peddle their distinct wares, it is like watching two different films at the same time. One features an overcharged female lead who stretches every sinew, flashes bloodshot eyes, flails her arms, and raises her voice at the slightest provocation....The portions of Jazbaa that are designed for Aishwarya border on the overly zestful and melodramatic. These stretches of the film will of course work for some sections of the audience. Passages of a far less demonstrative kind are delivered by Irrfan. He resorts to measured moves in playing a much-decorated but suspended Mumbai policeman.\" Read the review here .\n3) The Indian Express : Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is over-the-top in this convoluted crime-drama (Critic: Shubhra Gupta)\n\"The trouble with the film, all familiar green-tones and dark angles and panoramic views of the Mumbai skyline, is that it sticks too close to its brief, which is, clearly, to bring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan back in our midst. And to topline her above all else.\" Read the review here .\n4) Hindustan Times : Irrfan shines in this fast-paced thriller (Critic: Rohit Vats)\n\"The most striking thing about Gupta’s film is the over-dramatization of scenes which stops the viewers from getting involved in the film. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a well paced thriller, but primary characters’ penchant for invoking whistles dilutes the thrill to some extent.\" Read the full review here .\n5) India Today : Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's green return gift to Bollywood (Critic: Ananya Bhattacharya)\n\"One aspect that works in favour of the film is its run-time. In two hours, Jazbaa does raise some pertinent questions about the way justice is (un)delivered in the country. The music doesn't bother. The ghazal Jaane Tere Shehar Ka stands out among the rest. In all, Jazbaa is not quite the re-entry to Bollywood Aishwarya's fans had been expecting. But she does do a largely good job of nailing her mother-in-distress act... when not screaming her lungs out or weeping her eyes out, that is. Watch Jazbaa for the performances.\" Read the full review here .\nAlso read: Here's what Aishwarya Rai Bachchan thinks about 'Jazbaa'", "external_links": ["http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/jazbaa-review-aishwarya-rai-bachchan-is-sincere-but-needs-a-better-director-than-sanjay-gupta-2461850.html", "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jazbaa-movie-review-aishwarya-rai-bachchans-green-return-gift-to-bollywood-jazbaa-review-film-review-release-irrfan-sanjay-gupta/1/494407.html", "http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/jazbaa-movie-review-1187", "http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/jazbaa-movie-review-aishwarya-rai-bachchan/", "https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "http://www.hindustantimes.com/movie-reviews/jazbaa-review-irrfan-shines-in-this-fast-paced-thriller/story-U2ECBZpWGRHz8pZ4X5uZlO.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:03:48.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
