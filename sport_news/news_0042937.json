Antonio Valencia broke into space just outside the box, but his delivery across the penalty box to pick out the unmarked Jefferson Montero was overhit.\nAt the other end, Argentina went close but not close enough in the 17th minute. Alexander Dominguez was forced into a save by Angel Correa and the former then produced a finger-tip save to deny Aguero from close range after Angel di Maria teed up his teammate.\nThat proved to be Aguero's last bit of action as he was carted from the field two minutes later. Aguero clutched at his left hamstring and signaled to the bench after chasing down Achilier.\nEcuador continued to be a threat on the counter-attack in the first half, though it spurned another opportunity to hit the front approaching the half-hour mark, when Miller Bolanos fired over from the edge of the area following Valencia's cutback.\nIt was more of the same after the interval, with Ecuador wasting yet another chance to break the deadlock in the 58th minute. Lucas Biglia slipped in the middle of the field and Christian Noboa pounced and found himself in space outside the box but his chipped effort sailed wide of the post.\nArgentina had opportunities in quick succession from the 67th minute, though neither Javier Mascherano nor Di Maria found the back of the net. Mascherano linked up with Tevez inside the area but the outstretched Barcelona midfielder was unable to guide the pall beyond Dominguez, while Di Maria's attempted chip was dealt with.\nArgentina was then made to pay as a flick on from Segundo Castillo fell to Erazo, who stooped low to head past Romero with nine minutes remaining.\nAnd it got better for Ecuador just seconds later as Valencia sprinted into the box and passed the ball to Caicedo, who made no mistake from close range.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:46:42.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
