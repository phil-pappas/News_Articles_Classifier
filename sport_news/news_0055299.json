And that was just enough to help Freeport finish sixth in the NIC-10 boys golf season. The Pretzels finished two days at Ledges with a 743, one stroke ahead of Guilford and four ahead of Belvidere to climb up one spot after finishing seventh during the regular season. The NIC-10 uses four components in its conference standings, giving each team one point for each team it beats during the dual-meet season and also one point for each team it finishes ahead of in the first day of the conference tournament, the second day of the tourney and the total overall score. Freeport finished with 14 points to 13 for Guilford and nine for Belvidere. “That’s the lesson: every shot counts,” coach Matt Gallie said. “We ended up in sixth place by one shot. There’s 743 of them, and they all mattered.” Freeport was two strokes behind Guilford on Saturday, but three strokes ahead of Belvidere. On Friday, the Pretzels were one stroke ahead of Belvidere and three ahead of Guilford. And it was their total score of one shot better than Guilford that ultimately made the difference. Ruckman, a freshman, was a big part of that after following up his 53 on the front nine with a 43 on the back, his best nine-hole score of the season, according to Gallie. “After you shoot 53, it’s probably easy to phone it in, but Gannon did a good job on the back,” Gallie said. “I know we missed some short putts out there, but we seemed to stick with it even when we had some challenges out there. And you are gong to make some doubles in this kind of weather.” It was windy and cold both days. “The front nine, almost every hole was into the wind,” Ruckman said. “I pretty much had to guess which club to hit. I came up long or short a lot. “But I knew I could turn it around on the back. I’ve been shooting good on the back the last few times I played here. Even my dad told me while we were walking that I need to make every putt I can.” Ian McLain shot 87-90—177 to lead the Pretzels. Jack Heimer followed at 90-94—184, Ruckman at 93-96—189 and Andrew Bastian at 100-93—193. Hononegah won with a perfect score of 36 and beat three-time defending champion Boylan by 51 strokes with a 612 total. The Pretzels finished sixth with the youngest team in the field. Page 2 of 2 - “It was good and bad,” Ruckman said. “Bad because we feel we can beat them (Guilford and Belvidere) better, but at least we got it done. We’re halfway through the pack and we’re really young, so we can move up in the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:32:01.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
