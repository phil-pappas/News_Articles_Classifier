(REUTERS/Andy Clark) NHLers made headlines for wrong reasons in off-season \nThe Detroit Red Wings sent veteran right winger Dan Cleary and defenseman Xavier Ouellet to Grand Rapids of the American Hockey League on Thursday and took defensemen Jakub Kindl and Alexey Marchenko off injured reserve. \nThe 35-year-old Cleary cleared waivers after being cut by the Red Wings on Wednesday. He played in just 17 games last season and had two points after seeing action in 52 games the year before that and posting eight points. In four exhibition games this year, he had two points. \nIn 11 seasons with the Red Wings, Cleary has played in 609 games and totaled 275 points. His NHL career totals include 387 points in 938 games. \nCleary had signed a one-year, one-way contract worth $950,000 with the Red Wings in early September. \nThe 22-year-old Ouellet split time between Grand Rapids and Detroit last season. He had three points in 21 games for the Red Wings and 16 points in 52 games for Grand Rapids. \nThe Red Wings open the regular season on Friday night at home against the Toronto Maple Leafs.
