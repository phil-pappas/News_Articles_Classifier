With three starters and several key bench players, plus a few freshmen who will join the rotation, the Stanford women look formidable again.\nAdChoices Not formidable enough to be picked again to win the Pac-12, however. For the first time in 16 years, the Cardinal weren’t the top choice of the league’s coaches to win the title — Oregon State was, with Stanford second.\n“To me, it’s much more important how we finish than what people think at the start,” head coach Tara VanDerveer said Wednesday at Pac-12 women’s basketball media day.\nLast season, Stanford finished 26-10 (13-5 Pac-12) before winning the conference tournament and reaching the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16. At many schools, that’s a monumental season. At Stanford, it was a down year.\nAsked how she felt about not being a “target” for opponents, she said, “When we play, we will be.”\nShe enters her 30th season at Stanford and shows no signs of slowing down. VanDerveer signed a two-year contract last month.\nWhat she wants out of her team this season is more pace. She wants it to be more like her other favorite team, the Warriors.\n“We want to be up-tempo, more fast paced than last year’s team. This might be our best opportunity to run, pick up full court and play eight, nine or 10 people.”\nTwo of last season’s top scorers, guard Amber Orrange and forward Bonnie Samuelson, are gone, but guard Lili Thompson (last season’s leading scorer) is back.\nSo are speedy guard Briana Roberson, forward Karlie Samuelson (a sharpshooter like her sister, Bonnie) and post players Erica “Bird” McCall, Kaylee Johnson (9.6 rebounds) and Kailee Johnson.\nAnother terrific freshman class will buttress the rotation, including Alanna Smith, a 6-foot-3 forward who led Australia to third place in the FIBA Under-19 World University Championship in Chekhov, Russia, this summer.\nShe is the first high-level international player VanDerveer has recruited. The coach hopes Smith leads other Aussies to the Farm.\n“She can score a lot of different ways,” McCall said. “I never know how she’s going to finish.”\nMcCall was busy this summer as well. She won a gold medal for the U.S. at the World University Games in South Korea in July. “Being with an amazing group of girls helped my confidence,” McCall said. “Being a captain helped my leadership.”\nMcCall is being asked to play a much bigger role offensively rather than merely setting picks and getting rebound baskets. She averaged just 5.6 points last season. “This year, she’ll be a go-to player rather than a picker,” VanDerveer said.\nBesides Smith, another freshman who will play right away is point guard Marta Sniezek, who was also an All-America soccer player in McLean, Va.\n“She’s a floor leader,” VanDerveer said. “She has a very mature game for a freshman.”\nStanford was hurt when Karlie Samuelson broke a finger last season. The team is healthy for the time being, except for guard Alex Green, who’s not expected back until December because of a knee injury. Shannon Coffee, a 6-5 freshman forward/center, is being checked for a possible stress fracture.\nEven VanDerveer got hurt last year. She injured herself taking part in a drill. “I’m done taking charges,” she said. “Another coach said, ‘The S on your shirt stands for Stanford, not stupid.’”\nTom FitzGerald is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
