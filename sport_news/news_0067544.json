(AP Photo/Frank Augstein) more > By -   \nLONDON (AP) - The latest at the Rugby World Cup (all times local): \n5:51 p.m. \nNew Zealand advanced to the Rugby World Cup final by beating South Africa 20-18 in an attritional game in wet conditions on Saturday, keeping on track for a first successful defense of the title. \nThe All Blacks scored both of the semifinal’s tries at Twickenham, through flanker Jerome Kaino in the sixth minute and reserve back Beauden Barrett in the 52nd, and recovered from a 12-7 deficit at halftime. \nSouth Africa’s game plan, based on tough defense and kicking at every opportunity, frustrated New Zealand in the first half but was less effective after the break. The Springboks’ points came from six penalties - five by flyhalf Handre Pollard in the first half and another from his replacement, Pat Lambie. \nFlyhalf Dan Carter kicked the rest of New Zealand’s points through two conversions, a penalty and a dropped goal, in a match that stayed tense until the end. \nAustralia and Argentina meet on Sunday in the second semifinal. \n___ \n4:50 p.m. \nSouth Africa leads New Zealand 12-7 at halftime in the Rugby World Cup semifinal after four penalty goals flyhalf Handre Pollard and some impressive defense. \nAll Blacks flanker Jerome Kaino scored the only try of the first half, collecting a flicked pass from captain Richie McCaw to cross in the right corner in the sixth minute. Kaino ended the half in the sin-bin for deliberately playing the ball from an offside position in the 38th minute, which was New Zealand’s ninth penalty of the game so far. \nNew Zealand has dominated possession and territory in wet conditions, but has been dominated at the breakdown. Stuck in their own quarter much of the half, the Springboks’ discipline has been impressive and they will aim to take advantage of having a man extra early in the second half. \nPollard has been successful with all of his penalties attempts. Dan Carter converted Kaino’s try, but missed a shot at goal from a penalty. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:45:01.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
