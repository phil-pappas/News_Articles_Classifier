(Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images) \nDays before the Japanese World Series begins, the sport is being rocked by a gambling scandal involving several pitchers for the country’s oldest team. \nTwo more pitchers from the Yomiuri Giants were called out by Nippon Professional Baseball for betting on pro games, joining Giants pitcher Satoshi Fukuda, who allegedly bet on his team and Major League Baseball games. According to the Associated Press , Fukuda did not appear for the top team this season and could not have fixed games. However, gambling is a violation of the NPB charter. \nAlthough pitchers Shoki Kasahara and Ryuya Matsumoto admitted to gambling on baseball, they were not fixing games. \n“This is extremely regrettable,” NPB Commissioner Katsuhiko Kumazaki said. “Baseball holds a special place thanks to the support it has had for a long time from many fans.” \nGambling on pro sports is illegal in Japan and the Giants have cooperated with police in the investigation. \nKasahara, the team said, was found to have bet on 10 professional baseball games between April and October last year and on high school baseball games. Matsumoto bet on more than 10 games between June and October last year. Fukuda, trying to win back over $8,000 in gambling losses on high school games, bet on 10 NPB games and 10 major league games. \nThe oldest professional baseball team in Japan, the Giants were eliminated from the race to play for the Nippon Series on Saturday and team manager Tatsunori Hara resigned.
