He’s still just 23.\n“What he needs to do is present himself as a genuine batsman, an all-rounder who’s capable of scoring hundreds.\n“He had a disjointed Ashes with his selection coming in and out of the side and I don’t think that helps.”\nMoody stresses it’s crucial that Marsh puts some big scores on the board, starting with next month’s three-Test series against New Zealand.\n“It doesn’t mean that he has to go out there and smash hundreds in the first or second Test match, but showing signs he is emerging as that ideal all-rounder in that top six,” former Test all-rounder Moody said.\nTUBBY: NSW would make World Cup semis\nSTATS: Smith’s incredible 2015 just got better\nWiser heads still have plenty of faith in Marsh’s ability.

He says he has known Mitchell Marsh “since day dot”.\n“I’ve worked closely with Mitch over the last couple of years as a friend and as I suppose a mentor for him as he’s charting those choppy waters,” Moody said.\nOne of Marsh’s challenges is dealing with the weight of expectation, not only as an emerging player but as a possible future Test skipper as predicted by then-Australia captain Michael Clarke 12 months ago.\n“What Michael Clarke is saying there is that there’s more to Mitch than an exciting all-rounder,” Moody said.\n“He has genuine leadership qualities.”\nMoody says the pressure on Marsh “comes with the territory”.\nSelectors are willing to show patience as Marsh develops.

Given patience, that more often than not pays off over the long term.\n“We’ve seen that historically with Australian players, whether it’s Steve Waugh or the current Australian captain Steve Smith.”\nMarsh says he needs to start standing up at No.6.\n“My bowling is just a bonus,” Marsh told the Herald Sun .\n“I just want to do everything I can for the team to win. If that means getting my first hundred, that will be great. I feel that I’m not far away.”\nWestern Australia’s coach Justin Langer is also mentoring Marsh on the art of making big scores.\nFormer Test spinner Bryce McGain says Marsh is capable of being a world-class batsman and damaging pace bowler.\n“I think he will be a terrific player along the lines of Jacques Kallis,” McGain said.\n Mitch has itch for more runs", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/17/1227572/760196-8735b474-74a5-11e5-9c0a-ce1ed3f9b0e3.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/17/1227572/759840-f242fb50-74a5-11e5-9c0a-ce1ed3f9b0e3.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/cricket/mitchell-marsh-has-ability-to-make-it-to-the-very-top-says-mentor/story-fni2usfi-1227572760254"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:39:28.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
