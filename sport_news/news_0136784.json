With 97 wins, we like our chances.\"\nAlthough the Cubs would have preferred to play the wild-card game in front of their fans, they're just as confident in their chances after posting a major-league-best 48-33 road record — one win shy of their franchise record set in 1945.\nThey won their final nine road games — including three over the Pirates on Sept. 15-17.\nJoe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road Joe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road.\nJoe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road.\nSee more videos \"I personally like playing there,\" said Anthony Rizzo, who capped his second consecutive All-Star season with a two-run single in the first inning that gave him a career-high 101 RBIs. \"But we've just got to out and play. (The Pirates' fans) will be loud, but we'll be ready.\"\nRizzo, who hit 31 home runs, became the first Cubs player since Alfonso Soriano (2012) to hit at least 30 home runs and drive in 100 runs.\nBryant didn't carry his late struggles at the plate to third base, where he took away two hits in the last two games. Fellow rookie Addison Russell didn't commit an error at shortstop in 43 consecutive games, a streak that ended Thursday.\n\"Usually there's a clinch, and then there's a letdown,\" veteran catcher David Ross said. \"We haven't had that. These guys come to work every day and go about their business very professional-like. They're really mature for how old they are.\n\"It's a credit to the coaching staff with how they've worked with these guys and talked to them and communicated with what they want them to do. It's a good group to be a part of. We're excited to go to Pittsburgh.\"\nPhotos from the regular season finale at Miller Park.\nThe Cubs season could end abruptly with a loss to the Pirates, but Brewers slugger Ryan Braun said he is impressed with the Cubs' long-term prospects.\n\"Certainly they're set up really well for the foreseeable future,\" Braun told reporters. \"That's the blueprint.\n\"They have blue-chip prospects and depth. Everything they've done is something we can look to and hope to accomplish.\"\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\n Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Pittsburgh Pirates Ryan Braun Milwaukee Brewers Kris Bryant Anthony Rizzo", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611ab42/turbine/ct-cubs-at-brewers-20151004-005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611b63f/turbine/ct-joe-maddon-on-cubs-phenomenal-season-playing-on-the-road-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56117e74/turbine/ct-cubs-at-brewers-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127e49/turbine/ct-report-cubs-brewers-spt-1005-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611ab43/turbine/ct-cubs-at-brewers-20151004-003"], "published": "2015-10-05T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:52:35.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
