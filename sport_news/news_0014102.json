However, when goals by Pavel Kaderabek and Josef Sural put the Dutch in a 2-0 hole, the Netherlands called upon Robin van Persie in the 38th minute to find the back of the net. And he did just that in the 83rd minute. But, that score came after van Persie dug his club in an even deeper hole with an accidental own goal in the 66th minute.\nWith the Dutch still down by two goals, van Persie attempted to clear a corner kick out of the box, but the header veered in the opposite direction and went by goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet .\nRVP's body language says it all. He knows he messed up big time. He knows he's going to hear about this fail for weeks to come. Even though van Persie's goal cut the deficit to one goal, the Netherlands were unable to tie it up in the final minutes. They are now out of the competition.\n[via Streamable ]", "external_links": ["https://streamable.com/z2ns"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:39:36.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
