Cox, has denied the allegations. \nU of L hired former NCAA enforcement staffer Chuck Smrt to investigate Powell's claims, and the NCAA has also been looking into the book. Reports surfaced Friday that the NCAA also interviewed former U of L pledge Antonio Blakeney, who is a freshman at LSU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:34:14.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
