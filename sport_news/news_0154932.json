The 29-year-old announced he will begin preparations for Rio from next Monday after enjoying a break away from athletics. “I start training for the Olympics on October 12. It will be my last Olympics,” Bolt was quoted as saying by dailymail.co.uk on Wednesday. “I should have one more World Championships but I’m not too sure what I want to do after retiring. Some people say I should try acting but I think I will stay in sport and figure out what I can do,” the six-time Olympic champion added. The five-time ‘IAAF World Athlete of the Year’ award winner revealed he was instructed to take up running by his former coach Pablo McNeil. “I started off playing cricket first. I was a fast bowler and then he (McNeil) said I should try track and field so I decided why not and I did it,” Bolt remembered.
