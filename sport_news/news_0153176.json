The Philippines now plays Japan on Friday in the tournament semifinals. The winner of the FIBA Asia tournament earns an automatic invitation to the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.\nBlatche, who attended Syracuse schools before transferring to South Kent to finish his scholastic career, immediately entered the NBA upon his high school graduation. He played for the Washington Wizards, who used the NBA's amnesty clause to part ways with him, then played for the Brooklyn Nets before deciding to embark on a lucrative overseas career. He is now playing in China.\nBlatche is averaging 17 points and nine rebounds in about 24 minutes of play in the FIBA Asia tournament. He has, throughout his career, offered a blend of shooting and scoring ability that defies his 6-foot-10 size. Blatche is apparently playing this week with a sore ankle.", "external_links": ["http://www.fiba.com/asia/2015/0110/Philippines-Lebanon#|tab=boxscore_statistics", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQYXAqW3AyA", "http://www.fiba.com/asia/2015/Andray-Maurice-BLATCHE"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:09:22.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
