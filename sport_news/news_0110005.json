Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez was in Birmingham, Ala. , Wednesday to have his right knee - injured Dec. 3 - examined by well-known orthopedist James Andrews , according to a person familiar with the situation.\nSurgery is a possibility, a source said, but Sanchez is believed to be at least a week or two away from making a decision. Sanchez may seek yet another opinion. That may entail another doctor visit or perhaps having his MRI exam reviewed by another expert.\nThat he's seeking second and third opinion suggests this could be more than just a routine, clean-up procedure.\nSanchez suffered what the team called a mild sprain to his posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). He missed one game before returning to action with a brace. He appeared to have no ill effects from the injury during the Jets ' memorable stretch run - his play actually got better - but he was listed every week on the injury report.\nIt's possible that Sanchez may need a minor surgical procedure to repair any residual damage in the knee. The team has yet to make an official comment. GM Mike Tannenbaum will address the media Thursday in a previously scheduled season-wrapup news conference.\nAt the time of the injury, some of Sanchez's teammates were under the impression that he needed surgery, but Rex Ryan quickly downplayed the severity of the injury, calling it a \"mild\" sprain.\nTags: mark sanchez , james andrews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:13:17.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
