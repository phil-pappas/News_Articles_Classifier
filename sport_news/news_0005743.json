Picture: David Caird.\nDavid Riccio and Neil Cordy The Daily Telegraph FORMER AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou has ruled himself out of becoming the new boss of the NRL following CEO Dave Smith’s resignation on Tuesday.\nARL chairman John Grant confirmed the NRL will conduct a worldwide recruitment search — an exercise which could cost thousands of dollars — for Smith’s replacement as chief executive, despite a string of leading local candidates emerging immediately following Tuesday’s announcement.\nNo sooner had the curtain come down on Smith’s 34-minute final press conference that the names of NRL head of football Todd Greenberg, NRL head of strategy Shane Richardson, Gold Coast Titans CEO Graham Annesley, NSWRL CEO David Trodden and Penrith CEO Warren Wilson were mentioned along the corridors of League Central.\nBut it seems the one man NRL fans want, isn’t interested in the role.\nAfter running the AFL for 11 seasons, Demetriou quit as CEO in 2014. He did so leaving a legacy of exponential growth under his leadership and ultimately transforming the AFL into the top footy code in Australia.\nTodd Greenberg is being touted as possible replacement for Dave Smith. Source: News Corp Australia\nA recent Sunday Telegraph poll indicated more than 65 per cent of fans wanted Demetriou to take over the NRL.\nBut after accepting several positions on company board’s, including James Packer’s Crown Resorts, Demetriou indicated his time under the spotlight, pressure and critique that is sport’s administration was over.\nGONE: Smith quits as NRL CEO\nREACTION: How fans and colleague reacted to Smith announcement\nPODCAST: BUZZ ON DAVE SMITH’S DECISION TO WALK AWAY\n“I’m having too much fun what I’m doing now,’’ Demetriou sent via an SMS text message to The Daily Telegraph.\nMomentarily, Grant has been appointed the interim CEO until a replacement can be found.\n“When you look at our executive team they are a good team who understand their job and are doing a great job,’’ Grant said.\n“It would have been very disruptive to pull one of those out as we would have to backfill that person by moving someone else. We made the decision that’s its just too disruptive.’’\nBUZZ: Eastern suburbs banker didn’t get NRL\nREPLACEMENT: Who fills Smith’s shoes?\nHowever, he could not guarantee the ARL Commission would announce a replacement to Smith before the 2016 kick-off in March.\n“The objective is to get the right person in the job and that’s the process that we’ll go through,’’ Grant said.\nWho should replace Dave Smith as NRL CEO? “Our job as a commission is to ensure we make sure we get that. So we’re working to that process and that’s what we’ll do.’’\nIn a strong indication that Greenberg — who was appointed by Smith in 2013 — and Richardson would be given every chance to apply for the role, Grant said: “One of Dave’s objectives of being CEO was to bring on people who could potentially be successors to him over the long-term.\n“That was the plan.\n“We’ve got a search now which starts straight away, its an internal and external search and we’re hopeful that internal candidates stick their hand up.\n“We’ll get the right candidate. The end job of the commission to get the right person.’’\nTHE CONTENDERS\nTodd Greenberg\nNRL head of football\nTAB mock odds: $7\nHas made no secret of his desire to become CEO.
