Quarterback Mitchell Schurig connected with Braeden Ingold on a 13-yard touchdown through the air. It was the first pass attempt for Washburn Rural after starting the game with eight straight running plays. \nAfter forcing the Scots (0-6, 0-5) to punt on their first possession, the Junior Blues scored on their second drive with Hunter Browning capping a 49-yard drive with a an 8-yard touchdown run, his first of three on the night. \nLinebacker Will Jones opened the second quarter scoring by recovering a fumble and returning it 17 yards for a touchdown. The Washburn Rural defensive unit forced four turnovers and held the Scots to negative rushing yards. \n“We’ve kind of depended on the defense all year,” Junior Blues coach Steve Buhler said. “They played well tonight. The defense has been consistent and gives us a chance in every ball game.” \nBrowning led the offense in the second half scoring two touchdowns in the third quarter. The junior running back finished with a game high 87 yards rushing on seven carries. \n“He (Browning) played really well,” Buhler said. “He sets the tone for us by just how physical he plays. He gives everyone a ‘pick-me-up’ when he need one and he did a nice job running the ball in the third quarter.” \nSchurig finished the game with 123 yards passing on 10 completions, throwing for two scores. \nWashburn Rural (5-1, 5-1) 14 7 20 14 – 55 \nHighland Park (0-6, 0-5) 0 0 0 0 – 0 \nWashburn Rural — Ingold 13 pass from Schurig (Kayser kick) \nWashburn Rural — Browning 8 run (Kayser kick) \nWashburn Rural — Jones 17 fumble return (Kayser kick) \nWashburn Rural — Browning 26 run (Kayser kick) \nWashburn Rural — Browning 32 run (kick failed) \nWashburn Rural — Redd 10 run (Kayser kick) \nWashburn Rural — Martens 27 pass from Schurig (Kayser kick) \nWashburn Rural — Scott 11 run (Kayser kick) \nGAME IN FIGURES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:49:36.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
