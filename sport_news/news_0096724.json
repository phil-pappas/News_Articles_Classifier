At every turn, Hart pleaded with Hoilett to join Canada during 2014 World Cup qualifying. \nHe tapped him on the shoulder repeatedly — in 2011 and 2012 — until becoming so fed up with the Premier League winger’s stinginess he gave up completely. \nBack then, Hoilett — understandably — was more concerned with settling in at Queens Park Rangers, where a hefty contract awaited him. He was also considering the prospects of suiting up for Jamaica and England. \nPublic perception was that Hoilett thought he was too good for Canada — and maybe he was — with better options awaiting him. \nThree years later — a World Cup cycle too late, maybe — the Canadian Soccer Association on Wednesday announced the 25-year-old Brampton, Ont., native will feature for his birth nation. \n“I’m happy, excited,” Hoilett said. “I can’t wait to make my debut for the national team and show the fans what I can do as well as help the team achieve better things in the near future and help the Canadian Association move forward.” \nStill, Hoilett’s sudden eagerness to suit up for Canada appears out of necessity more than anything. \nHe has appeared just twice — in two Cup games — for Rangers this year. \nA loan deal hasn’t been an option. He makes too much money at the struggling championship side. \nHe needed an opportunity to play games — something Canadian head coach Benito Floro jumped at. \n“We (Floro) sat down prior to the decision and he was just giving me confidence and telling me to just be out there, be happy, play your game,” Hoilett said. “I’m looking forward to being out there and creating chances to help win games.” \nHe’ll likely get his first opportunity on Oct. 13 when Canada plays Ghana in a friendly at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. That match will serve as preparation for a pair of massive World Cup qualifiers come November — in Vancouver against Honduras on Nov. 13 and in El Salvador on Nov. 17. \nWhile the Canadians have looked resolute on defence in Floro’s rigid 4-1-4-1 system, goals have been hard to come by. Canada was held goalless in three Gold Cup games earlier this summer and could only muster a 1-1 draw in Belize during CONCACAF’s previous round of World Cup qualifying. \nIf anything, though, the addition of Hoilett increases a meager Canadian player pool desperate for attacking talent capable of getting behind opposing defences and beating players off the dribble. \nAnd, quite frankly, adding Premier League experience to a roster lacking offensive depth is a positive. \nIf only this addition had more to do with the badge than the opportunity to play games. \nAIRD ADDED, TOO \nHoilett wasn’t the only splash Canada’s men’s program made Wednesday afternoon. \nRangers FC let it slip that Canada has convinced midfielder Fraser Aird to join Les Rouges. \nIn Aird, Canada gets an additional offensive threat in a midfield lacking an abundance of attacking options. \nHe’ll bring a bit more bite to a Canadian side that will likely need to grind out a result in Honduras, El Salvador or Mexico in order to advance to CONCACAF’s final round of World Cup qualifying. \nKIDS BEGIN QUALIFYING \nCanada’s under-23 national team is in Kansas City to kick off Olympic qualifying. \nCanada meets the United States at Sporting Park Thursday night at 9 p.m. EDT on TLN. \nIn a four-team group that also includes Cuba and Panama, Canada is in need of a top two finish in Group A that would set up a semifinal meeting with a team from Group B (Mexico, Honduras, Haiti or Costa Rica). \nA semifinal win will secure qualification for the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. \n“The most important thing we have to do in the games is just to do what we’ve been doing in the camp,” said Floro. “They are fighting well and have been pressing a lot so we need to play while thinking about our possibilities.” \nCanada upset the U.S. 2-0 during 2012 Olympic qualifying in a match played at Nashville’s LP Field. \nSamuel Piette is the only returning player from that team. \n“For sure we want to repeat what we did three years ago against the USA,” said Piette. “The most important thing is to try and get the win and we want to go for the three points here.” \nCanada hasn’t qualified for an Olympic Games in men’s soccer since 1984.
