Football Coach By MARC TRACY Supported by Photo The former U.S.C. Coach Steve Sarkisian said some of his recent behavior was the result of mixing alcohol and medication. Credit Nick Ut/Associated Press \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Southern California fired its football coach, Steve Sarkisian, on Monday, one day after Athletic Director Pat Haden announced that Sarkisian would take a leave of absence after he failed to show up for a practice. “After careful consideration of what is in the best interest of the university and our student-athletes, I have made the decision to terminate Steve Sarkisian, effective immediately,” Haden said in a statement . On Sunday afternoon, Haden said in a brief news conference that on a phone call with Sarkisian earlier in the day, “it was very clear” that Sarkisian was “not healthy.” In Monday’s statement, Haden said “we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well-being.” OCT. 10, 2015 While speaking at a donors’ event in August, Sarkisian, apparently slurring his words, insulted several of U.S.C.’s opponents and added an expletive to the U.S.C. cheer, “Fight on!” He later said his behavior arose from mixing alcohol and medication. At the time, he said that he would seek unspecified treatment, and the university announced that alcohol would be banned from the coaches’ locker room. But after it was announced Sunday that he would take a leave of absence, reports emerged that some Trojans assistant coaches believed Sarkisian had not been sober during U.S.C.’s 42-14 win at Arizona State on Sept. 26. Sarkisian was 12-6 at U.S.C., and has an overall head-coaching record of 47-35. The Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pacific-12) play at No. 14 Notre Dame Saturday night. The offensive coordinator Clay Helton will serve as the Trojans’ interim head coach.
