All services were suspended overnight.\nEurostar passenger trains and vehicle ferry services resumed progressively Saturday.\nThe French police took control of the situation on site to prevent migrants crossing to the U.K., according to Eurotunnel.\n\"Such a large group had no chance of reaching the U.K., so this was clearly an organized attack aimed at drawing media attention to the desperate situation of the migrants who are stuck in Calais\", Eurotunnel said in a statement.\nTwo police officers and four migrants suffered minor injuries, local authorities of the Pas-de-Calais region said.\nCalais is a focal point for thousands of migrants who are trying to cross illegally from France into Britain.\nSecurity surrounding the tunnel beneath the English Channel has been ramped up in recent months. Barbed wire fences are going up around the complex, which has a perimeter of 28 kilometres (17 miles), and security teams have been bolstered with more police and dogs at the site.\nOn Wednesday, an Eritrean migrant was found dead in the tunnel, the latest of 13 migrants killed this year in the area, most of them on the Eurotunnel site. The administration for the Pas-de-Calais region says the migrant was apparently hit by a freight train near the entrance to the tunnel in Calais.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:18:42.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
