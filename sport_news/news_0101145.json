Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports ST. PETERSBURG - \nThe plan was for Mark Buehrle to get six quick outs on Sunday afternoon. \nAnd then the lefty, with 200 innings logged for a 15th consecutive seasons, would head to the mound at Tropicana Field for a third inning. \nBefore the first pitch of the third, starters David Price, Marcus Stroman, R.A. Dickey and Marco Estrada would emerge from the third base dugout, make the trip to the mound and the five starters would leave together. \nLike many good plans conceived by well-meaning men it came undone. \nQuickly. \nThree pitches into Buehrle's bid Ryan Goins booted a lead-off grounder and four Rays hitters later first baseman Edwin Encarnacion muffed a soft liner. With two out, Buehrle walked in a run and allowed a grand slam to Joey Butler. \nThe Tampa Bay Rays scored nine times -- nine unearned runs -- against Buehrle. \nManager John Gibbons lifted his lefty with two out in the first, 45 pitches into Buehrle's final start on one day’s rest. He finished with 198 2/3 innings. \nSo close and yet so far. \nThe Jays didn’t want to bring either Stroman or Dickey back on three day's rest to start Sunday. \n“I applaud what Gibbons is doing, it’s about winning but the game is about history,” said former big league slugger Orestes Destrade of FOX-TV before the game. “You will never see this again: 15 years straight at 200 innings.” \nThe San Diego Padres' James Shields has the next longest active streak at nine years. \nYet, Buehrle finished stuck at 14 consecutive seasons of 200 innings. \nJays fans Joanne Melanson and Scott Bringloe held a sign down the third base line which read: “200 IP X 15 YRS - GIT-R-DONE.” \nThey are from Moncton, N.B. but moved to Toronto and now live on Front St. They are Rogers Centre regulars. \n“I made the sign up last night,” said Bringloe. “I didn’t know he would be starting.” \nBuehrle didn’t get it done. \nChicago White Sox assistant general manager Dave Yoakum, in his 24th year with the White Sox -- where Buehrle won the 2005 World Series -- was on hand watching the game. \n“He always worked at such a quick pace, he never got frustrated, he was a guy who could give up four runs in the third and still pitch eight,” said Yoakum. \n“He always pitched to location, was always a great teammate. I’ve seen him throw 84 mph and break five or six bats. That was an unfortunate finish. He should have got out of the first.” \nThe first started with Brandon Guyer reaching on the Goins error. Josh Donaldson made a diving stop and threw out Guyer at second for the first out. Evan Longoria and Asdrubal Cabrera each singled to set up Steve Souza’s hump-back liner which Encarnacion could not handle. \nAn out later there was a bases-loaded walk, Butler slam, a double by Luke Maille and a single by Guyer. \nAnd out came Gibbons -- not the four starters to remove Buehrle a final time. \nGibbons patted Buehrle on the chest. \nBuerhle patted Gibbons on the arm.
