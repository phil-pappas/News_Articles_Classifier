Bobby Jindal's recent order to block the funding.\nU.S. District Judge John deGravelles in Baton Rouge ruled early Monday. He had heard arguments Friday.\nPlanned Parenthood challenged the state's right to end the funding for cancer screenings, gynecology exams and other health services.\nJindal, running for the Republican presidential nomination, began the defunding effort after videos were released by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress.\nThe center said the videos showed that Planned Parenthood illegally sells fetal tissue for profit. Planned Parenthood, which does not currently provide abortions in Louisiana, denies the allegation and says the videos are misleading.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
