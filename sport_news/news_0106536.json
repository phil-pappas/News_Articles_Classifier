He bounced off or drove his way through several tackle attempts on a 27-yard touchdown reception with 1 minute, 15 seconds left in the Warriors' 7-0 victory at Oakland High. \n\"I saw my team was down,\" Alberty said. \"I had to get in there for my team.\" \nAlberty foreshadowed his heroics for McClymonds (8-0, 3-0 Oakland Athletic League) on the Warriors' previous series. McClymonds faced a first-and-46 situation on its 14-yard line after a penalty. He calmly ran for 21 yards on first down, then 15 yards on second down before Purvis ran 11 yards on third down for a first down. But the series ended when Fremont's Ronald Ragland grabbed his second interception of the game. \nBut the Tigers offense was then limited to a three-and-out series, and Alberty started the eventual game-winning drive with a 31-yard run to get the Warriors into Fremont's territory. Alberty finished with a game-high 113 yards rushing and 51 yards receiving on two catches. \nFremont (3-5, 2-1) didn't give up after Alberty's touchdown, however. The Tigers drove for three first downs in the final minute and were on the McClymonds 44 when the Warriors' William Ross picked off his second pass of the fourth quarter with 20.2 seconds remaining. \n\"It was a great game,\" McClymonds coach Michael Peters said. \"We are real young, but when the lights turn on, these guys don't give up.\" Advertisement \nThe Tigers also battled hard. They had four interceptions off McClymonds quarterbacks -- besides the two by Ragland, Amir Blackburn and Kenyon McTear also had interceptions. \n\"I'm extremely proud of how my guys played tonight,\" Fremont coach Terry Hendrix Jr. said. \"We came to play. We will see them in the Silver Bowl.\" \nMcClymonds stretched its winning streak against OAL teams to 38 games, but it was the Warriors' closest victory in that streak since a 21-14 win over Fremont on Oct. 18, 2013. \nBesides defense, penalties permeated this year's game. Three second-half touchdowns were called back because of penalties -- two by McClymonds and one by Fremont.
