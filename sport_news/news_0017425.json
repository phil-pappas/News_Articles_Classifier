Last week, we didn't play well in the red zone. We've had some struggles going on, struggles to run the ball, had some things going on up front, but that's part of the National Football League. We've got to keep plugging and guys have to step up. I have confidence in our coaches and our players, and this week is another opportunity to get better. It's part of the journey.\" \nDenver safety T.J. Ward added, \"We look at it as we're winning football games and that's most important, regardless of how it's getting done. I think the best part about this team is we're truly a team. We don't point fingers. We don't do any of that type of stuff. As long as we're coming out with the win, it doesn't matter how we get it.\" \nManning is known across the league as a perfectionist who is a tireless worker in the film room in order to prepare himself and his teammates on offense for their upcoming opponent on a weekly basis. And Manning's preparation is something Kubiak is grateful for. \n\"Hopefully, (we) have him a long time,\" Kubiak said. \"I like it. He's great to have. It's tough to be a head coach in this league regardless, but that's part of this league. There's a lot of hats you have to wear and a lot of things going on, but he's a joy to work with and enjoy every day.\" \nRight now, Manning is spending as much time as possible preparing for the Cleveland Browns, whom the Broncos play at FirstEnergy Stadium Sunday. In his 18-year career, Manning has posted a 6-0 record with 138 completions for 1,456 yards and five touchdowns against seven interceptions against the Browns. \nWith Manning having graduated from the University of Tennessee, the alma mater of Cleveland owner Jimmy Haslam, he has been tied to rumors of coming to the Browns in an executive role when he hangs up the cleats and unbuckles the chinstrap and shoulder pads for the final time with the Broncos. \nAlthough Kubiak believes Manning \"can do whatever he wants to do\" in the game of football, much like John Elway, the Broncos' Executive Vice President of Football Operations/General Manager, did when he retired as the quarterback who engineered back-to-back runs to Super Bowl championships in the late 1990s, he believes there is a lot more football left for Denver to play. \n\"He can do whatever he wants to do,\" Kubiak said. \"His football knowledge and his drive to compete and lead people is as good as I've ever been around. It's a joy for me to be around. Only he can answer that question if it's something he wants to do someday, but I think anything he chooses to put his mind to he's going to be very successful, much like John has done. \n\"I don't think we're through. I think we've got 10 weeks left to play. We all have to get better, and if we all get better, we'll help him from that standpoint. That's how I look at it as a football coach. Like I said, there's a long way to go. There's a lot of observations after six weeks, but we're working toward 16 is what we try to stay focus on, and this week is the next game.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LyeH69 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:17:55.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
