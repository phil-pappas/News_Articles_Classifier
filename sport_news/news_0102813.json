It could have quite an impact on the profits and advertising matrix of all three online giants. Yahoo reached a profound new deal with Google on Tuesday. Google is going to provide Yahoo with search relevant advertising on its desktop and mobile and search engine. Google will complement the search services provided by Microsoft.. \nThe agreement with Google provides Y! with additional flexibility to choose among suppliers of search results and ads. During the third quarter, Yahoo unveiled a new custom audience feature for its Gemini ad platform and introduced Yahoo News Live, a daily news stream which features Katie Couric. So the move into more substantial media content is sure to be a next step for their business model. \nDigital media company Yahoo said its revenue rose 6.8 percent to $1.23 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Gross search revenue was $870 million for the third quarter of 2015, up 2 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014. \nY! will continue to offer its own search technologies and advertising products, such as Yahoo Gemini, which was the company’s first unified ad marketplace for both mobile search and native advertising. A little over a year since Yahoo Gemini was created, Microsoft and Yahoo amended their existing partnership to allow Yahoo to serve Gemini search ads for up to half of Yahoo’s desktop traffic. \nNot all search advertisers have adopted Gemini, so the impact it is having is likely far less overall, but it does appear that Yahoo fully intends to bring as much traffic under the Gemini platform as it is able to under their renegotiated agreement with Microsoft. For advertisers, this means having another major US search ad platform to manage, but it could also be an opportunity for growth, depending on how well Gemini performs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:08:21.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
