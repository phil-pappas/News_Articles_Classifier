The Blue Devils allow an ACC-best 9.3 points per game. \n\"That sort of kicked off our journey as the back end of the Duke defense,\" Edwards said of a unit that also includes juniors Deondre Singleton and Breon Borders. \n\"It's kind of like, we've got to go out there and do even better than we did in the past,\" he said. \"We won that game, but there were some things that we didn't do right, we just got away with because of our athletic ability.\" \nDuke cracked the national polls during its week off last week, and this marks the first time since 1952-57 that the Blue Devils appeared in the rankings in three straight years. \nCoach David Cutcliffe said the ranking is something \"you look at (the players) and tell them you've earned\" it, but called it \"meaningless at this point. \n\"You've earned it to this point — if they want to pat themselves on the back for 3 seconds, do that, but that's about the end of the value,\" he said. \"You've got to keep battling your way in it, and then you've got to battle to be a factor in the end when the dust settles. ... To do it again is a huge challenge but it's also a huge opportunity.\" \nThe Blue Devils know it's way too soon to think about another berth in the ACC title game — games at surging North Carolina and against No. 25 Pittsburgh loom next month. \n\"We still have six more games to go,\" Edwards said. \"I believe we can do better than we did (in 2013) because there was some stuff we left on the table. ... We try to go and make it better than it was in the past, keep improving our program to take the next step.\" \n___ \nAP Sports Writer Hank Kurz Jr. in Virginia contributed to this report. \n___ \nFollow Joedy McCreary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joedyap \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
