PAUL, Minn. — Former Topeka High standout Alec Beatty’s first defensive start in college proved a dandy. \nBeatty, a three-time All-City selection, recorded seven tackles and two interceptions, including one at the goal line, this past Saturday to help Macalester secure a 28-14 victory against Beloit. The outing earned Beatty honors as Midwest Conference defensive performer of the week, the league announced Monday. \nA freshman who started the season at quarterback, Beatty also recovered a fumble in the first quarter, rushed three times for 17 yards and had a 19-yard punt return for Macalester. Beatty’s performance led a defensive effort that yielded only 272 yards offense to Beloit, which entered the game averaging 499 yards. \nBeatty and the Scots will continue Midwest Conference play against Lawrence at 1 p.m. Saturday in Appleton, Wis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:36:33.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
