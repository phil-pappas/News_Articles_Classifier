V) extended their win streak to seven games and earned the first division title for either school of the newly combined program in more than 25 years. Lansing finishes the regular season at 2-6, 2-1. \n“It’s unexplainable. It feels amazing,” said Dalrymple, who rushed for 82 yards on nine carries while scoring two touchdowns. “We wanted this so much that everyone did exactly what they needed to do.” \nPruitt led the Seneca Indians with 174 yards on nine carries, including a 75-yard touchdown run on the first play of the game. The junior added a 28-yard touchdown scamper late in the first quarter to up the Seneca Indians' advantage to 16-8. Pruitt didn't carry the ball in the second half. \nRappleye, who did the bulk of the running in the second half, finished with 139 yards on 16 carries with two touchdowns. \nThe hosts led 30-20 at halftime and 36-26 after three quarters but scored three touchdowns in the first six minutes of the final quarter to increase their lead to 34 points. \nSenior Chedzoy, who was crowned Homecoming king at halftime, added 94 yards and two TDs on seven carries. The Seneca Indians finished with a 499-302 advantage in total yardage. \nJunior back Tim Kelley led Lansing with 157 yards on 26 carries and the first four Bobcat touchdowns. Mason Boothe, Lansing’s freshman quarterback, was 4-for-12 passing for 58 yards and an interception. Zach Detrick capped the game's scoring with a 5-yard TD run in the fourth. \nNext up for WG/O-M is the first postseason appearance by either school since the state tournament began in 1993. The Seneca Indians, ranked 21st in Class C, will face Div. IV runner-up Newark Valley in a Section 4 Class C semifinal at 3:30 p.m. Saturday at Union-Endicott's Ty Cobb Stadium. \nLansing was to play state champion Chenango Forks in the other semifinal but withdrew because of injuries suffered in Saturday’s game, Athletic Director Adam Heck said Sunday. The Bobcats were forced to forfeit a regular-season meeting with No. 1-ranked Forks on Oct. 16 due to an insufficient number of healthy players. Dryden will play Forks instead. \nNewark Valley 47, Whitney Point 6: On Saturday at Whitney Point, Chad Wright’s 78-yard interception return for a touchdown gave Newark Valley a 13-0 lead and sparked its offense as the Cardinals went soaring into the Class C sectional playoffs. \nWright’s interception return came after a fumble by the Cardinal offense and squashed Whitney Point’s momentum. \nDryden 21, Thomas A. Edison 6: At Dryden, the Lions broke open a close game with two third-quarter touchdowns in a Section 4 Division V game. \nEdison (2-6, 0-3 Division V) trailed 8-6 before Dryden’s run. The win earned Dryden (5-3, 1-2 Division V) third place in the division over the Spartans. \nDryden will face two-time defending state champion Chenango Forks at 12:30 p.m. in the other semifinal at U-E.

Last week against Spencer-Van Etten he rushed for 347 yards and five scores and stands at 1,784 yards for the season. \nLyon also had an interception to snuff a Crusaders drive at the end of the first half. \nLyon gave the Blue Devils (5-3) the lead for good, 19-13, when he ran in from 14 yards out with 1 minute, 15 seconds remaining in the first half. He also had touchdown runs of 3, 10, 14 and 70 yards. \nMoravia earned a semifinal berth against Deposit/Hancock on Oct. 31 at Binghamton Alumni Stadium as part of a Class D doubleheader. Deposit/Hancock was a 66-12 quarterfinal winner over Groton on Friday. \nNotre Dame finished the season with a 5-3 record. \nDeposit/Hancock 66, Groton 12: On Friday in Hancock, senior back Ronnie Ballard ran for 214 yards and four scores to lead second seed D/H past the Indians and into the Class D semifinals. \nBallard, a converted quarterback who also threw a 60-yard pass to Colby Hall off a flea-flicker, has 1,797 rushing yards this season despite not playing past the eight-minute mark of the third quarter in the past three games. \n“He’s an incredible player, and a big weapon,” Deposit/Hancock coach Jeremiah Johnson said. \nDylan Cooper gave No. 7 seed Groton (4-4) an early 6-0 lead, but D/H scored the next 38 points before Matt Gombas (19-59) scored the Indians' second touchdown in the third quarter. \nTioga 59, Oxford 26: On Friday at Tioga, senior back Jesse Manuel rushed 31 times for 265 yards and five touchdowns as the top-seeded Tigers (7-1) ousted Oxford (4-4) in the Class D quarterfinals. \nManuel increased his record career rushing total to 7,381 yards and also scored his 100th career touchdown. \nTioga, the four-time defending Class D sectional champion, will face fourth seed Walton in a Class D semifinal next Saturday at Binghamton Alumni Stadium. The Warriors advanced on Saturday with a 36-18 quarterfinal victory over fifth-seeded Harpursville. \nMaine-Endwell 56, Ithaca 20: On Friday at Spartan Stadium in Endwell, the top-ranked Spartans (8-0) ran their state-record win streak to 59 games with an easy victory over the Little Red (0-8), who lost for the 32nd straight time over the past three seasons. \nCoach Kelly Gordon's Ithaca squad (0-4 Div. I) is scheduled to end the regular season this weekend at Norwich (2-6, 1-5 Div. III), at time to be announced. M-E hosts Union-Endicott at 7 p.m. Friday in the Section 4 Class A semifinals.
