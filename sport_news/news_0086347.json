The thing that really got her going was the signatures she got from around the world on her (online) petition. Every time the total went up another 100 – that seemed to be a benchmark.\"\nThe Halloween display at a home in south Naperville has attracted national attention for the dozens of ghosts, goblins and skeletons in the front yard and its dazzling light show set to music.\nTo date, Sara has garnered more than 10,000 signatures from around the world supporting her measure to bring back the haunted house on Conan Doyle Road, though relatively few signatures came from Illinois. Thomas' next-door neighbor Jim Jandick, who represented Thomas at a homeowner's association meeting where the issue was discussed, said there is a bigger back story to the whole issue that needs to see the light of day.\n\"When Nick started playing the Queen song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' last year and even the band was talking about it, everybody did what I call 'a face plant' on Facebook – that's what I call it – after the thing went viral,\" Jandick said. \"But what really matters is a couple of days before Halloween last year, a bus from (Naperville School) District 203 came over with all these high school kids and each one was a caregiver for someone in a wheelchair. Having a haunted house made their day.\"\nFellow marcher Matthias Berck said he has lived in Naperville the past two years and called what young Sara has done \"remarkable.\"\nFamous Naperville Halloween house goes dark Jane Donahue Folks driving to Nick Thomas' house on Conan Doyle Road in Naperville this Halloween season expecting to be treated to the famously decorated house will go away feeling tricked.\nAfter neighbors complained to the Ashbury Homeowners Association board about the traffic and noise created by the celebrated...\nFolks driving to Nick Thomas' house on Conan Doyle Road in Naperville this Halloween season expecting to be treated to the famously decorated house will go away feeling tricked.\nAfter neighbors complained to the Ashbury Homeowners Association board about the traffic and noise created by the celebrated...\n(Jane Donahue) \"I can see both sides of this issue as far as the homeowners' association and what people living here want to do, but the fact Sara has pulled this off is remarkable,\" Berck said. \"People have enjoyed coming here, both for Halloween and Christmas, and folks really like the 'show' it seems.\"\nBobby Stevens, who lives in Lockport, has friends in the neighborhood and decided she needed to come out and support the cause.\n\"I protest against the fact that a few people's decision has affected the whole subdivision,\" she said. \"I think it's amazing how support has picked up. I don't feel there should be any restrictions and this could really be a show if it wasn't for some Ebenezer Scrooges. There has been so much enjoyment, especially for the handicapped kids that have visited and the ones that live here.\"\nAfter shaking hands with Thomas and offering him a copy of the petition signatures, Sara offered another solution to the problem.\n\"Maybe you could put half the decorations on your lawn, and the other half on the next door neighbor's, and then we'd have it all,\" she said in reference to the homeowner's decision about how much of the property decorations could occupy.\n\"There you go,\" Jandick replied. \"That would be fine with me.\"\nDavid Sharos is a freelance reporter for the Naperville Sun.\nCopyright © 2015, Naperville Sun Halloween Haunted Houses (attractions)", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f2c95/turbine/ct-nvs-halloween-house-naperville-st-1004-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c2134/turbine/ct-nvs-halloween-house-walk-st-1025-20151025", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f2df4/turbine/chi-photos-naperville-haunted-house-20141016"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:38:37.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
