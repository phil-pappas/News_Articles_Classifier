They can take the 15-yard penalty, of which Fulton could deny, but it would count as unsportsmanlike conduct against Carter. But that means if Carter's coach gets another, he'd have to miss a game.\"\nFulton coach Rob Black asked the TSSAA to make an exception on Thursday, but the request was denied.\n\"You don't want a coach under that kind of pressure if (Carter coach Jeff McMillan is) assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty out of the gate,\" Black said. \"I talked to an official on Monday who said they'd have to flag them for it.\"\nJersey switches aren't new. The Farm Bureau series began in 2013, and includes 32 games this year.\nA team will wear pink in every one of them.\nLast season, Carter wore pink for a game against Grainger, which wore blue instead of white, but no penalty was assessed for the tedious violation.\nHalls and Gibbs, which play at Halls on Friday, traditionally wear their home jerseys during their game, but were not flagged to start last season's meeting.\n\"I don't see what the big deal is,\" Halls coach J.D. Overton said. \"In the regular season, I don't see what it matters as long as they are contrasting colors and the coaches agree on it.\"\nVenue Switch: Concord Christian will play Friday's home football game against Hancock County at Catholic High School, due to subpar field conditions.\n\"We normally play at (Mayor) Bob Leonard Park,\" Concord Christian coach Troy Fleming said. \"But with the condition of the field and expected rain, the city wouldn't let us play on it. Fortunately, Catholic has an away game and was gracious enough to let us use their field.\"\nThe game is the first for Hancock since quarterback Dakota Blevins died in a single-car accident on Saturday.\nConcord Christian, which forfeited its game last week due to concussion protocols, is expected to have enough players against Hancock.\nGeer Picks Carson-Newman: Bearden girls basketball senior wing Chanler Geer committed to Carson-Newman on Tuesday, choosing the Eagles over King. She also had late interest from Tennessee Tech.\n\"They were a really good fit for me,\" said Geer, an All-KIL selection as a junior. \"I went up there and visited a couple times, and liked the campus and atmosphere. They're a top Division II program. I respected that a lot.\"\nBearden Clinches District: Bearden's girls soccer team clinched a regular-season District 4-AAA title on Wednesday by tying Hardin Valley 2-2.\nCasey Riemer scored both goals for the Lady Bulldogs, who have enjoyed a renaissance season.\nBearden (11-2-2, 6-0-1 District 4-AAA) didn't lose in district play this season, and beat traditional power Farragut for the first time since 2010 on Sept. 24.\nBearden plays at Oak Ridge on Thursday, and has non-district games scheduled against Science Hill, Catholic and McMinn County before beginning district tournament play on Oct. 10.\nOther regular-season soccer champions include Powell (3-AAA), South-Doyle, which clinched a District 2-AAA title by beating Jefferson County 3-2 on Thursday, and Christian Academy of Knoxville (4-A/AA).\nGrace Christian and Gatlinburg-Pittman are the top seeds in bi-divisional District 3-A/AA.\nGreeneville has clinched a regular season title in District 2-A/AA.\nVolleyball Top Seeds: Farragut (District 4-AAA), Anderson County (3-AAA), Morristown West (2-AAA), Catholic (4-AA), Gatlinburg-Pittman (3-AA), Greeneville (2-AA) and Jellico (4-A), Concord Christian (3-A) and Berean Christian (2-A) have clinched regular-season district titles and are the No. 1 seeds heading into next week's district tournaments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:25:48.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
