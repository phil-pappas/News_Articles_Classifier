The 49ers announced that the 49ers fired Erickson and dismissed general manager Terry Donahue during a news conference at 49ers headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., Jan. 5, 2005. PAUL SAKUMA AP i \nmbarrows@sacbee.com \nSANTA CLARA -- Welcome to 2004. There's fighting in the Gaza Strip, Bush is running for President, a new Star Wars movie is coming out soon. And the 49ers have just undergone a massive roster overhaul. \nGone are long-time veterans like Jeff Garcia, Garrison Hearst and Derrick Deese. So is the most cantankerous personality of his generation, Terrell Owens. Thank goodness that guy's out of the building; he made life miserable for everyone. \nThe 49ers figure they have some promising young pieces -- Tim Rattay at quarterback, Kevan Barlow at running back, Kwame Harris at tackle -- who can slide into starting spots and they convince themselves, 'You know what? This will work.' \nIt doesn't. Not even a little bit. The 49ers fail miserably and the season ends with the coach sacked, the general manager booted and the team looking for a quarterback of the future. \nThe 49ers haven't had a turnover like that until this year. \nThe circumstances are different. Salary-cap bungling was the primary cause of the great meltdown of 2004. But that season and this one both are the result of failed strategies and the inability to build a bridge from a winning, but fading, era. \nThe 49ers should have known this type of season was coming. They lost key players to retirement, allowed others to depart in free agency and didn't retain their most talented coaches. The national media, the local media, the wannabe media, your dermatologist, the guy who replaced your air conditioning unit all predicted choppy seas. \nEveryone except the 49ers. As was the case in 2004, they convinced themselves the changes would work. They were sure of it. They just needed to allow Colin Kaepernick to do what he does best, needed more blitzing on defense, needed to get combustible Jim Harbaugh out of the building and -- voila! -- they would be a team that finally could beat the Seahawks for division dominance. \nInstead the 49ers are competing to stay out of the division cellar. \nThe current 49ers are unlikely to finish with just two wins like they did in 2004. They are not the worst team in the league like they were then. In the first part of the season, they faced quarterbacks like Ben Roethlisberger, Aaron Rodgers and Eli Manning. The back nine includes Jay Cutler, Josh McCown and Nick Foles (twice). At some point center Daniel Kilgore will return from injury to help the overmatched offensive line. Linebacker NaVorro Bowman's knee will continue to get stronger, the young players will adjust. \nBut as was the case in 2004, there has been a overestimation of roster talent. On the defensive line, Quinton Dial and Glenn Dorsey are not nearly as good as Justin Smith and Ray McDonald while Tank Carradine has had a hard time even getting on the field. \nAlong the offensive line, the 49ers allowed Mike Iupati to leave in free agency figuring that one of two third-round picks from 2014 could step into his spot. One of them, Marcus Martin, has been forced to play center where he is ranked 33rd out of 34 players at his position by the independent scouting service Pro Football Focus. The other, Brandon Thomas, has been inactive for all but one game and has yet to play an NFL snap. \nThe right side of the offensive line is composed of a journeyman free-agent pickup in tackle Erik Pears and two vagabond guards, Jordan Devey and Andrew Tiller, who alternate series. Only one starter on the offensive line was drafted by San Francisco's current front office. In fact, of the 49ers' 11 offensive starters, just four -- Kaepernick, Carlos Hyde, Vance McDonald and Martin -- were drafted by general manager Trent Baalke. \nThe 49ers hoped Kaepernick would rise up and help the team smooth over any post-Harbaugh bumps. Instead he looks like he could be the fall guy in the short term. \nJim Tomsula said Friday that Kaepernick remains the starter, but if his up-and-down season continues, the Nov. 15 bye week appears to be a convenient point to make a move and insert Blaine Gabbert into the lineup. \nAt that point, the message would go from 'Harbaugh was the problem' to 'Kaepernick was the problem.' And since Harbaugh handpicked picked Kaepernick, they are really one in the same. \nOf course, the problems won't go away. They run beyond the quarterback and are deeper than anticipated, just as they were in 2004. The 49ers began that season one year removed from the playoffs, started a massive rebuild the following year and were dreadful for a long, long time. \nWelcome back. \nMatt Barrows: @mattbarrows , read more about the team at sacbee.com/sf49ers .
