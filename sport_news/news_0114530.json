He's very explosive, he's fast, he can hit the hole, he can make things bounce. He can hit anywhere on the field and that's really something special that a running back has. I his think speed to get to the perimeter is really something too.\"\nRELATED: Rewinding Malzahn's thoughts on Kentucky, going home to Arkansas on Tiger Talk\nAuburn's defense ranks 13th in the SEC and 101st in the nation in rushing yards allowed this season with 197.7 per game. The Tigers have been burned by Louisville's Lamar Jackson (111 yards), LSU's Leonard Fournette (228), San Jose State's Tyler Ervin (165) and Kentucky's Boom Williams (118).\nCollins racked up a combined 475 yards and four touchdowns against Texas Tech, Texas A&M and Tennessee before Alabama managed to contain him for just 26 yards on 12 carries Oct. 10. He had 10 carries for 68 yards and 18 carries for 92 yards against Auburn in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nMalzahn must also prep his Tigers for Arkansas backs Raleigh Williams and Kody Walker, who is expected to return to action after missing the last four games with a broken hand.\n\"They have multiple running backs that we think are talented and they did lose a very good one earlier in the year and it just gave (Collins) an opportunity to step up,\" Malzahn said. \"He seized the moment carrying a little bit more, but he looks very comfortable doing it.\"\nAuburn linebacker Tre' Williams, who has 23 tackles this season, is looking forward to facing a physical Razorback team.\n\"As a linebacker, you have to enjoy contact,\" he said. \"With Arkansas, you're going to come out of this game pretty sore. You have to get your mind right from Day 1. We knew what we were getting into ever since the beginning of the season... It's going to be a big one and it's a must-win, so we're going to do whatever we can do to get that W.\"\nAuburn (4-2, 1-2 SEC) and Arkansas (2-4, 1-2) are set for an 11 a.m. kickoff.\nAuburn beat writers discuss Malzahn/Bielema rivalry Auburn beat writers Brandon Marcello, James Crepea and Wes Sinor talk about the rivalry between Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn and Arkansas head coach Bret Bielema after practice Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in Auburn, Ala.
