The Frogs held off SMU's furious rally for a 56-37 victory before 48,127, the third-largest crowd in Amon Carter Stadium history.\nTCU's celebration was countered by the loss of another defensive starter. Cornerback Ranthony Texada suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first half.\nThe teams combined for 1,228 yards of offense â” most ever in the series â” with TCU outgaining SMU, 720-508.\nQuarterbacks Trevone Boykin of TCU and Matt Davis of SMU posted the top two total-offense performances in series history.\nBoykin finished with a combined 504 yards and six touchdowns. He completed 21 of 30 passes for 454 yards and four TDs with one interception.\nDavis had a combined 392 yards. He completed 17 of 31 passes for 330 yards and one touchdown with no interceptions. He rushed 17 times for 62 yards and two TDs.\n\"First off, you have to give SMU credit on offense, coming out and doing a great job,\" TCU coach Gary Patterson said. \"Came back, fought back in the ball game and went about their business. Then you have to give our guys credit for doing the same thing. So, 3-0.\"\nFor SMU, coming off a 1-11 season, this was its second strong performance against a top-five opponent. The Mustangs pushed Baylor, then No. 4, to the fourth quarter in a 56-21 opening loss.\nAfter Chad Morris posted his first win as SMU's coach last week against North Texas, his team was not interested in another moral victory. But despite the loss, the Mustangs looked even more dangerous against TCU.\nSMU did not have a turnover, ending the Frogs' nation-leading streak of 27 games with at least one takeaway.\nThe Mustangs (1-2) look like they could be a contender in the American Athletic Conference. They conclude non-conference play against James Madison at home next week before starting conference play against East Carolina on Oct. 3.\n\"We bent but never broke,\" Morris said. \"I told our guys there are winners and learners. We learned a valuable lesson.\"\nThe Frogs (3-0) certainly discovered some things to work on before starting Big 12 play next week at Texas Tech.\nTheir decimated secondary had big trouble on deep balls. They struggled to contain SMU's prolific freshman wideout Courtland Sutton. The acrobatic 6-4 Sutton drew two interference calls, as well as one on himself, while catching four passes for 114 yards, including a 46-yarder.\nThe Mustangs, knowing TCU was vulnerable deep, wanted to limit rewards for the Frogs' risk-taking defense.\n\"That's what we do every game,\" Davis said. \"We knew TCU has a very aggressive defense, so we thought we might be able to get over the top on them.\"\nThe Frogs seemed in control after taking a 42-17 lead with touchdowns on their first two drives of the second half.\nBut instead of caving, the Mustangs fought back, scoring on their next four possessions.\nSMU drove 75 yards to score on Davis' 4-yard run, and then Horace Richardson went 19 yards with an interception to TCU's 25. Three plays later, Davis rumbled in from the 1.\nThe Mustangs then forced TCU to punt and drove 55 yards for Chad Hedlund's 21-yard field goal on the final play on the third quarter. Hedlund also made kicks of 22 and 32 yards.\nNeeding to change the momentum, the Frogs extended their lead to 49-37 on Boykin's 42-yard pass to Josh Doctson with 6:32 left in the fourth.\nTCU put the game away on the next two drives. On fourth-and-2 at TCU's 46, Davis threw incomplete to Sutton, covered tightly by Nick Orr. Morris argued unsuccessfully that Orr was holding Sutton's jersey from behind as he reached around to break up the pass.\nThe Frogs then drove 53 yards in seven plays, taking 4:05 off the clock. They scored on Aaron Green's 1-yard run.\n\"We've been about no excuses here,\" Patterson said. \"That's a tough loss with Ranthony [Texada]. But it is what it is. Our backup corners, we've got nine games, and they can all throw it, so the key to the whole story is, we better play the ball in the air, we better not panic and we better get ready to go, because everybody is going to throw vertical.\"\nClick here to visit the SMU page.\nNichols: SMU throws scare into No. 3 TCU, but Frogs QB Boykin's six TDs too much for Mustangs\nExperience playing Baylor, TCU for SMU freshmen will 'will pay big, big dividends' as season progresses\nSMU-TCU quick hits: Frogs strike quickly in first half; Mustangs test TCU secondary\nPhotos: Trevone Boykin leads TCU as Frogs claim Iron Skillet with 56-37 win over SMU\nSMU's Courtland Sutton makes best catch of the year... that doesn't count\nTCU quotable: Gary Patterson not happy with defense; 'You watched it, they had 500 yards'\nFive Thoughts: SMU shows no quit under Chad Morris, nearly shocks rival TCU\nClick here to visit the TCU page.\nFive thoughts from No. 3 TCU's 56-37 win over SMU: Horned Frogs escape upset bid to capture Iron Skillet\nOn Twitter:\n @BillNicholsDMN", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcu-horned-frogs", "https://twitter.com/BillNicholsDMN", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/smu-tcu-quick-hits-frogs-strike-quickly-first-half-mustangs-test-tcu-secondary", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/smu-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/20/tcu-quotable-gary-patterson-happy-defense-watched-500-yards", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-smu-shows-quit-chad-morris-nearly-shocks-rival-tcu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/nichols-smu-throws-scare-3-tcu-frogs-qb-boykins-six-tds-much-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-3-tcus-56-37-win-smu-horned-frogs-escape-upset-bid-capture-iron-skillet", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/09/19/photos-trevone-boykin-leads-tcu-battle-iron-skillet-smu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/solid-outings-baylor-tcu-means-experience-smu-freshmen-will-will-pay-big-big-dividends-season-progresses", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/smus-courtland-sutton-makes-best-catch-year-count"], "published": "2015-09-20T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:43:37.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
