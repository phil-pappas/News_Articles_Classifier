Dhoni (left) and Bhuvneshwar (right) celebrate after the duo combined to dismiss Morne Morkel (centre), South Africa's last wicket, in Indore \nThanks to Dhoni's unbeaten 92, India had a fighting total of 247/9 in 50 overs. Though it felt like it would not be enough, the bowlers produced the goods to bowl out the opposition for 225. \nThe win in Indore levelled the 5-match series. It now stands at 1-1 with the 3rd ODI on Sunday (October 18) in Rajkot. (Lot of people waiting with open swords for me: Dhoni) \nSpeaking about Dhoni's knock and the victory, Bhuvneshwar praised Dhoni that it was not the first time he had single-handedly led the way. \n\"This is not the first time that our captain has single-handedly led the way. He has been doing it for many years now and we have always seen over the years that he always comes out on top when the team is in such a difficult situation. \n\"He has always made it a point to take the team to a good total and won us games. You need a batsman like him who bats long and also carries the tail-enders and gives them the confidence to bat well. We are lucky that we are playing under him and learning a lot from him,\" Bhuvneshwar told BCCI's official website today (October 15). \nThe right-arm bowler said Dhoni had brought in a positive vibe at the innings break after returning to the \"Rahul Dravid Dressing Room\" . \n\"When MS Dhoni walked into the dressing room after playing that knock, he just brought in a positive vibe with him. We as a team just believed that we could defend this total. \n\"The talk amongst ourselves was that 250 is a tricky score and we have to bowl well to win this match'. We did exactly that and we will remain positive in the coming matches as well,\" he added. \nOneIndia News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:35:09.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
