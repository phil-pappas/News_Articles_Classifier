The program's 14-U team was expelled from its league after a fight broke out in the stands at its last game. WILLIAM WILSON LEWIS III , WILLIAM WILSON LEWIS III FILE PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » THREE THINGS TO KNOW • Inland Empire Ducks U-14 team has been expelled from its league by San Diego Youth & Cheer officials\n• Team was the top-ranked American Youth Football team in the country by at least one media outlet\n• Ducks officials considering entering the team in AAU Football league\nA top-ranked Riverside County youth football team is looking for ways to get back in its league after being expelled following a fight in the stands during a weekend game in San Diego County.\nOne representative from the Inland Empire Ducks said the organization is mulling options in the wake of the incident which occurred at a San Diego Youth Football & Cheer game involving its 14-and-under team on Saturday, Sept. 27, at Otay Ranch High School.\n“What I suggested to the board is that we take action to do everything we can to get reinstated,” said Garrett Grant, a coach for the U-12 team who has sons who play for the program.\nGrant said if the league does not overturn the expulsion, the Ducks could resort to legal action.\nHe also said IE Ducks officials are looking for options beyond the league to continue their season. One of those is AAU Football, which sanctions leagues in Southern California.\n“We’re trying to keep the season alive for the kids,” said Grant. “Our first option is (San Diego Youth Football & Cheer). But there are a number of organizations out there.”\nIE Ducks board president Art Perez declined comment. An email sent to San Diego Youth Football & Cheer commissioner Cathy Luna on Wednesday received no response.\nThe IE Ducks program, established in 2011, has a number of teams at different age groups. It plays home games at Corona High School. Its website features pictures of players from the program who have gone onto play at Corona Centennial High School, Santa Ana Mater Dei High School and Las Vegas Bishop Gorman High School.\nThe 14-U team -- ranked No. 1 in the country in American Youth Football by at least one media outlet -- was playing a game against Otay Ranch, also a highly touted squad.\nA series of videos of the incident posted on YouTube shows heightened tensions brewing during the game, with the public address announcer calling for a halt to action on the field while supporters were asked to move to opposite ends of the stands.\nLeague officials were present and made aware of the issues between the adult fans, said Grant.\nThe altercation erupted with the Ducks leading 48-0 late in the fourth quarter. As the fight ensued in the stands, a person could be heard over the public address system pleading: “Please stop fighting ... please stop fighting. This is for the children.”\nNo players were involved, but officials stopped the game.\nAccording to an Associated Press report, police responded to the incident but no arrests were made. Both teams were suspended for the remainder of the season, according to the report.\nGrant said the league cited it’s zero-tolerance policy as the reason the 14-U team was expelled.\n“Because there was fighting in the stands, they removed us from the league,” said Grant.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9682 or tsheridan@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvkl43-b88529266z.120151001184856000gqjcbpmm.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvkl43-b88529266z.120151001184856000gqjcbpmm.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:19:05.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
