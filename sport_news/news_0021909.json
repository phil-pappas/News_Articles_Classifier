The news certainly dampens the feel-good story of the Gator resurgence under first-year coach Jim McElwain. \nNobody doubts that Grier, who was visibly upset and expressed remorse in a brief news conference, feels awful about this stunning development. I’m sure when the skinny quarterback came to Florida in January, 2014 — then started the process of putting on weight and gaining strength to help him eventually win a starting job from Treon Harris — he didn’t figure on getting popped for taking a PED. \nHowever, let’s hold off on the Grier sympathy cards until we know more information. We don’t know for certain if this was an “honest mistake” by Grier, as UF football coach Jim McElwain contended at a brief news conference. \nMaybe Grier took what he thought was a no-big-deal supplement and it slipped his mind to not check with UF’s medical staff. Or maybe he felt he needed that unidentified product — the school cannot reveal what it is without Grier’s consent — and didn’t want to know if it was among the NCAA’s eight categories of banned substances. \nWhen it comes to positive PED tests for athletes, there’s been enough history of denials/playing the naivete card to know this should be viewed with ambivalence or suspicion. At least until all the evidence comes out, which is unlikely, and any doubt is removed. \nLike any NCAA athlete, Grier knows the No. 1 rule before taking any over-the-counter substance. Athletic department personnel preach it constantly. It’s also spelled out in bold, capital letters in the NCAA manual: “STUDENT-ATHLETES — IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK WITH ATHLETICS STAFF BEFORE USING ANY SUBSTANCE.” \nNot only did Grier neglect to do that, it raises the question of why. It’s no secret the 2013 National Player of the Year wanted to bulk up significantly after enrolling early at Florida. The 6-foot-2 quarterback went from about 170 pounds to 190 during his redshirt year. He’s now listed as 201 pounds in the UF media guide, but he told me at Media Day in August he was closer to 215. \nWhatever his actual weight, Grier obviously put in the work and got bigger pretty quickly. It’s anybody’s guess whether the banned substance pushed things along. But it’s certain Grier should have known better than to take it without checking its legality. \nIn the meantime, Gator fans should pump the brakes on any sky-is-falling outrage over this possibly sabotaging UF’s feel-good season. Florida is plenty capable of still winning a mediocre SEC East division without Grier. Remember, the Gators routed Georgia last year when their offense was a virtual train wreck. \nAnd if UF’s season happens to go downhill, then Grier ought to be sorry. His stupidity put him and his teammates in a terrible position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:26:14.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
