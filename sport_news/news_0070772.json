(AP Photo/Pat Sullivan) Kansas City Royals' Salvador Perez (13) celebrates with teammate Mike Moustakas, right, after hitting a two-run home run against the Houston Astros in the second inning during Game 4 of baseball's American League Division Series (AP) \nRoyals manager Ned Yost said the Royals battled the flu in September and he was going to let it run its course. \nMonday, he will find out whether the ailing bats and sporadic starting pitching doom the Royals season or they live to fight another day. \nThe Astros are on the verge of eliminating the AL Central champs after Sunday's win gave Houston a 2-1 lead. \nLance McCullers got the nod for Houston. The 22-year old posted a 3.22 ERA, the best among rookies with at least 20 starts. Hard-throwing Yordano Ventura got the ball for the Royals. He finished the season with a 2.38 ERA in his last 11 starts. \nBoth pitchers started the first inning by hitting a player on the hand. Neither throw appeared intentional. \nIn the second inning, Royals catcher Salvador Perez was visibly upset after a foul ball hit a young fan. Shortly after that, he hit a two-run opposite field home run, giving the Royals the lead. \nIn the bottom half of the frame, Ventura gave up a home run to centerfielder Carlos Gomez. He gave up a second home run to Carlos Correa in the bottom of the third. Ventura is pitching on short rest. \nA well-hit double by Correa in the fifth gave the Astros the lead. He padded the lead by hitting a two-run shot off reliever Ryan Madson in the seventh inning. The next hitter, Colby Rasmus, hit another home run off Madson. \nIn the eighth inning, the Royals strung together a series of singles and got a run to cut the lead to 6-3. The hits continued along with an Astros miscue and the score is tied 6-6 in the 8th inning. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
