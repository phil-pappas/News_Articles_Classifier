The Sun Devils needed four games to dispatch the Sultans 25-12, 16-25, 25-18, 25-11. With the win Apple Valley improved to 3-1 in league while Sultana dipped to 2-2. Burroughs lost to Serrano to also fall to 2-2. “It was a really good matchup,” Apple Valley coach Michelle Goodrow said. “They have a really good team. We kept plugging away and kept playing hard.” The match was tied 1-1 after two sets. Goodrow credited Alex Rozhon for her setting and her team’s serving for breaking the tie and taking the match. Apple Valley’s Courtney Chew helped the cause with 10 kills, five aces and four blocks. Alex Parisian knocked down 14 kills to go with her 20 digs; MacKenzie Goodrow chipped in with 13 kills, 17 assists and 18 digs; Kaitlyn Jones contributed 24 digs; and Cassie Hatcher added four kills. Sultana coach Dwayne Wibeto said his team struggled beyond their win in the second set. “That was the only one where I felt we passed well and we were able to serve them tough to keep them out of their system,” Wibeto said. After that set, the Sultans’ serving misfired. “We missed almost 20 percent of serves,” Wibeto said. “That’s way too many free points. Apple did a great job of defending everything and making it real tough for us to score.” Tayler Miller led Sultana with 10 kills; Lauren Lewis added eight kills and 11 digs; Hannah Gaaf had 18 digs; and Jenna Mendenhall put up 21 assists. Sultana (10-4, 2-2 MRL) heads to a tournament at Ayala High on Friday and Saturday before wrapping up the first round of MRL play on Oct. 14 at home against Burroughs. Apple Valley (15-2, 3-1 MRL) is off until Oct. 14 when it hosts Oak Hills.
