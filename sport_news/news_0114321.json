The stream reached HD levels, the average rebuffering ratio was nearly 1 percent and the game was broadcast at 60 frames per second. Average Internet video is usually distributed at 30 frames per second. \nYahoo said that by comparison, 1.8 million unique users tuned into the WatchESPN app for the 2014 World Cup final between Germany and Brazil and that Sunday's audience was almost twice the size of the average audience (7.9 million) that TBS attracted for last week's NLCS between the Chicago Cubs and New York Mets. \n\"It's been a great opportunity to partner with the NFL and deliver a truly exceptional global live streaming experience for our users,\" said Adam Cahan, Yahoo's SVP of Product and Engineering, in a statement. \"We're seeing a dramatic shift in the industry as audiences' primary video watching moves away from TV. We were thrilled to join the NFL in setting a new standard for sports programming for our users and advertisers.\" Pro Football Talk notes that the NFL is expected to continue with the streamed games experiment. \nSunday's Bills-Jaguars game was the first time that international viewers were able to access a NFL game without cable or satellite. \nThe NFL's TV contracts with CBS for Sunday afternoon AFC games, FOX for Sunday afternoon NFC games, NBC for Sunday night games, ESPN for Monday night games and DirecTV for Sunday Ticket all run through 2022, but internet streaming is seen as a new source of distribution and revenue for the NFL in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:23:12.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
