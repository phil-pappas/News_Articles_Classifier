Here are some highlights:\nQuestion: Is Leary taking all 1st team reps? Is Irving working at SDE or WDE?\nSturm : Yes, to the best of my knowledge, Ron Leary is a go and is ready to take his spot back at left guard. I think the Cowboys are happy to get their front 5 back in order. As for David Irving, I am interested to see how this works. I was very disappointed with the DE play on Sunday, but looking back, how would anyone expect Ryan Russell, for instance, to dazzle in his first opportunity on the NFL field? He was a 5th rounder who had mixed reviews at Purdue last year, so to assume he is ready to deal with Atlanta is far-fetched. It was Russell, Jack Crawford, and DeMarcus Lawrence on Sunday playing most DE snaps. They needed more to assist. It looks like Jeremy Mincey is back for the Saints, but if Irving can provide some SDE - at 6'7, 275, he should, maybe they can deal with edge runs a bit more competently moving forward.\nQuestion: Bob, why is the \"best O line\" in the game struggling this much after 3 games? Is the loss of Callahan overshadowed by the loss of Murray?\nSturm : Well, I hope I have spent enough time emphasizing that this offense worked last year because of a balanced approach that put the defense in a real bind. Without the run game, Dez Bryant and the receivers would have faced more coverages that threw numbers at them. Without the passing attack, DeMarco Murray would have faced more loaded boxes. But, together, with an efficient QB, they slew every opponent with a balanced, pick your poison attack that did not let the opponent breath. Now, with no Romo and no Dez, teams are selling out to slow the Cowboys short stuff. This means they are sitting on zone plays and trying to plug up the run game. We want to blame the OL, but overall, it seems possible they are just facing different obstacles they did not have to deal with much with 9 and 88 out there.\nQuestion: We all know Weeden was check down Charlie vs. Atlanta but across the league, aren't most QB's throwing it short a ton? I don't see a lot of QB's throwing it down the field with regularity. Brady makes a living on short throws and even during the Packers game on Monday, they showed Rogers passing chart (who might be the best QB I've ever seen) and it was mostly throws less than 5 yards from the line of scrimmage.\nSturm : Oh yes. It isn't about NOT throwing the short pass. That is efficient and useful for sure. It in some ways replaces the run game and spreads the defense thin to both flanks. The issue with Weeden is that you must stretch the field and threaten other spots. If you do that, you are fine to work the underneath. But, if you don't threaten the field, then you face all the defense up tight making everything tighter and less productive. Weeden threw 4 passes over 10 yards on Sunday. You use Rodgers on Monday, he threw 11 passes over 10 yards. Who do you think the safeties took more seriously for a deep shot? You simply have to make sure they respect you to go over their heads. But, the Cowboys haven't done that enough to scare anyone.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nMore Cowboys coverage Latest news, opinion, analysis\nGeorge: Lance Dunbar, Cowboys' Darren Sproles starter kit, will return to play in hometown New Orleans\nCowboys' Jeremy Mincey regrets playing with concussion: Family is 'team' I should play for\nBob Sturm: On the offensive line's struggles; on Brandon Weeden's short throws\nQB Tony Romo does light cardio work\nBob Sturm: What kind of impact Greg Hardy will have when he returns; is Terrance Williams a No. 2 WR?\nRB Lance Dunbar: Sitting back and watching for a couple years made me a better person\nCowboys Q&A: Tyler Clutts explains rookie songs, being in chess club, the weird things his son eats and more\nChristine Michael in the mix to be on Cowboys' active roster\nSportsDay experts, more give their Week 4 NFL picks\nDo the Dallas Cowboys have a quarterback controversy?\nTerrell Owens is still waiting for Jerry Jones to call about that Cowboys comeback\nSturm's Xs and Os: How Cowboys made Julio Jones' 45-yard TD easier and more\n10 things you might not know about Lance Dunbar, including how he ended up at North Texas\nCowboys send RB Joseph Randle message after his career day\nWashington basketball star still has soft spot for Cowboys\nWhat players, coaches, execs, opponents say Travis Frederick: Doesn't matter if QB is back there making a sandwich, we have to hold our blocks\nCowboys WR Terrance Williams takes responsibility for disappearing act, says 'there are no excuses'\nCowboys' Brandon Weeden never thought he'd ever be asked if he checks down too much\nSaints coach Sean Payton: Cowboys might be lacking 'spaghetti sauce' element without Tony Romo\nStephen Jones: We're not trying to hold on, we're trying to win games\nSaints RB Mark Ingram: 'Anytime you get a chance to play the Cowboys it's always a big deal'\nFun stuff\nFantasy football: Time to grab Cowboys' Lance Dunbar\nCowboys fans tear into Brandon Weeden in Top 25 fan-made memes\nNeed a laugh after the game?
