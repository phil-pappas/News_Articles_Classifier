James Forcillo has pleaded not guilty to second degree murder and attempted murder in the death of 18-year-old Sammy Yatim.\nLast week, jurors watched videos and heard audio recordings of the confrontation that ended Yatim's life.\nYatim was standing on an empty streetcar holding a small knife and refused to drop it during a 50 second confrontation with Forcillo before he was shot nine times.\nCrown prosecutors have said they plan to prove that Forcillo's actions during the July 2013 incident weren't necessary or reasonable.\nForcillo's lawyer has said his client's actions were justified and carried out in self-defence.\nThe jury has also heard that Yatim consumed the drug ecstasy before he boarded the streetcar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:03:10.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
