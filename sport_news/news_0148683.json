October is a peak time for tarpon hookups by casters along Brevard beaches. (Photo: Bill Sargent/For FLORIDA TODAY) \nCan you believe it’s already October? \nWell, savvy East Coast anglers had it circled in red on their wall calendars because they know it marks the fall kickoff for some of the best ocean catches of the year. \nIt relates directly to the fall baitfish run led by the schools of black and silver mullet that will be moving south along our coast in quest of warmer climes. Even the slightest water temperature drop to our north is the signal for the mullet, plus menhaden, glass minnows and other baitfish, to head south. All become prime forage for the larger predators. \nThe Canaveral Bight, a 4 1 / 2 -mile stretch of inshore water immediately north of Port Canaveral, is one particular spot that fires up with multiple species as October moves into November and the winter months. \nBetween now and the end of January, this short stretch of protected coastline tucked inside the projecting tip of Cape Canaveral becomes a haven for the likes of snook, redfish, jack crevalle, Spanish mackerel, tarpon, bluefish, sometimes cobia, and as the season progresses, pompano and whiting. \nHistorically, the Canaveral Bight has stood as a premier fall and winter fishing ground for small boaters who need the protection from strong northerly winter winds. A boat is necessary because the entire shoreline is part of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and it is closed to the public. \nOne of those small boaters is Phil Woodham of Titusville, who fishes the Bight from a Hell’s Bay flats skiff. \n“When the winds start beating out of the west and northwest with the cold fronts, it’s the place to go,” said Woodham, who for more than 35 years has been a regular at the Bight, the exception being the nearly six years when it was part of the 3- by 23-mile coastal closure following the 9-11 terrorist attacks. \nChuck Bauer says he makes the drive from his Orlando home a couple times a week to specifically target the Bight in his 14-foot boat. \n“Since they reopened that area eight years ago, I’ve found it’s a great spot for small boaters like myself,” Bauer said. “The wind can be howling from the northwest and I can still get in a day of good fishing.” \nBauer uses live mullet on weighted bottom rigs exclusively for snook and redfish early in the season before switching to lipped plugs that he slow trolls parallel to the beach when the supply of bait diminishes in late November and December. \nNoted inshore guide Troy Perez is another fan of the Bight. \n“Snook can be phenomenal up there in October when the finger mullet come around the tip of the Cape and head down that shoreline,” Perez said. “Reds can be there as well.” \nClients of inshore guide Jim Ross already this season have released big redfish and jack crevalle that Ross found following the mullet. \nVeterans like these anglers know the best areas and how they should be approached. One technique is to anchor or use electric motors to hold their boats at a safe distance outside the surf and then cast their baits toward the beach. They look for darker shades of water signaling the presence of deeper troughs, runouts and holes, which are prime for holding baitfish. \n“A live mullet on a 1-ounce split shot and 40-pound mono leader gets snook or the reds,” Perez said. “The snook are 10 to 12 pounds, but we’ve released 20-pounders. We’ve also had 40-fish redfish days.” \nA technique used by Ross is casting lipped plugs toward the beach. \n“I use 7 1 / 2 -foot rods with 6-pound braided line and large Rapala plugs for long casts,” said Ross, who positions his bay boat with a trolling motor. “We try to hit the sand and retrieve the baits off the beach. The strikes sometimes come within the first 15 to 20 feet.” \nAt times, bluefish or large Spanish mackerel intercept the plugs. \nSpecial attention must be paid to incoming swells when positioning a boat outside the surf line because of the dangers of being swamped or even rolled. Needless to say, this tight inshore technique should not be attempted by the inexperienced. If you’re part of that group, hire a knowledgeable guide. \nTroughs and depressions dropping to 20- and 25-foot depths are along portions of the beachhead and the guides know they can be key spots to drift live mullet, pinfish or menhaden for bigger redfish and snook. \nTom Ference, a retired schoolteacher from Merritt Island who started fishing the Bight in 1971, waits until December and January when the greater numbers of pompano and whiting appear. \nFor the pompano, Ference rigs two 1 / 8 -ounce chartreuse-colored, commercial-grade jigs in tandem and tips the hooks with small pieces of peeled shrimp. For the whiting, he switches to a small circle hook on a sliding-sinker flounder rig and again uses pieces of peeled shrimp. The rigs are cast along the edge of the surf line where the occasional flounder will be a surprise. \n“The Bight is such a fun place to fish because you’ll catch everything,” said Ference, who uses a 16-foot skiff. “I think it’s because of the proximity to (Port Canaveral) with its deep water, its jetties and then the beach.” \nFor boat launching, the relocated Freddie Patrick Park ramps on the south side of the port adjacent to Jetty Park provide close access to the Bight and the open Atlantic. There’s no charge for launching. \nOctober also can be the peak month for tarpon along our coast when these bruins are on the prowl for large mullet, putting them within reach of casters on the beach. It’s a sporting opportunity for foot fishermen to hook up with these giants, and each fall the band of surf casters increases. \nMelboune’s Roland Van Arsdale already this season has scored multiple tarpon hookups between Melbourne Beach and Sebastian Inlet. \nWhile boat fishermen have reported larger ones, one of the heaviest documented catches from the surf was estimated at 140 pounds. Charlie Fornabio of Wabasso landed and released the giant on a Sunday afternoon in October 2006. \nFornabio and fellow casters concentrate on the deeper surf zones north and south of Sebastian Inlet, and also around Wabasso Beach and Vero Beach. They use strong 10-foot rods, and heavy-duty spinning reels with good drag systems and spooled with 20- to 30-pound braid for maximum casting distance. \nMagnum-size plugs, some designed as swimmers and others as surface baits, draw most of the strikes. Heavier shad-tail swim baits also work. Few of the tarpon are landed, with most jumping off soon after the strike. \nIf a fish is fought to the beach, conscientious anglers release it in the surf without beaching it. Pressing down the barbs on hooks or replacing large trebles with single hooks are common practices to eliminate stress on the fish and for a safer release for the angler. \nContact Bill Sargent at sargentwb@gmail.com. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1Lafgmv TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:18:41.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
