( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nThe city of Loveland didn't need another reminder of just how cruel softball regionals can be, but it got one anyway. \nA year after Mountain View failed to make it to state following a stellar regular season, Loveland suffered the same fate Saturday at Barnes Complex. \nThe Indians — who went 16-3 in the regular season and finished with just one loss in a Front Range League that has five teams going to state — saw their otherwise terrific 2015 campaign come to a gut-wrenching end with a 10-7 loss in 10 innings to Eaglecrest in the 5A Region 7 state qualifying game. \n\"It's very frustrating, especially coming into this 16-3 and just not showing up to play,\" said LHS center fielder Tatum Rembao, who was 2-for-4 with a double and an inside-the-park home run in the season-ending loss. \"That's not like us at all. We just weren't ready to play and it kinda bit us in the butt.\" \nFrom the start it just wasn't the Indians' day as the hosts opened the tournament by striking out 16 times in a stunning 12-3 loss to No. 26 seed Chatfield, a team that went just 8-11 in the regular season but went on to win the regional title with a wild 13-11 win over Eaglecrest. \nThe seventh-seeded Indians rebounded to keep their season alive with a 10-4 win over No. 23 Mountain Vista, boosted by a seven-run fourth sparked by Macey King's two-run homer, followed later by a two-run double by Rembao. Advertisement \nIt looked like the Indians would for sure get a rematch with Chatfield, but the Chargers pulled off a dramatic seventh-inning comeback to win the regional title, setting up the qualifying game with 10th-seeded Eaglecrest. \nA run-scoring double by Kassi Reiger followed by a two-run homer by Jessi Case put the Indians up 3-0 after two. LHS then stretched its lead to 5-1 in the third with two-run single by Abby Lukkes, and at that time it appeared the Indians had successfully bounced back and were ready to punch their ticket to state. \nHowever, a pitching change in the third by Eaglecrest quieted the Indians' bats as Kathleen Ingram came in and gave up just two runs on three hits in 7 2/3 innings to earn the win. \nMeanwhile the Raptors offensive slowly got going against Lukkes, who threw 22 of the 24 innings her team played Saturday. Eaglecrest scratched across two each in the fourth and fifth and another to tie it in the sixth, the fourth unearned run allowed by the normally sure-gloved Indians. \nLoveland had its chances to win it late, mainly the seventh when Rembao led off with a double but was stranded there. In the eighth both King and Reiger were on with two outs when a hard-hit grounder by Addi Woodard was mishandled by the Eaglecrest shortstop, appearing to set the Indians up with the bases loaded; but runner interference was called on King to end the threat. First baseman Addi Woodard takes a swing during her team's loss to Chatfield on Saturday. ( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nLHS went down in order in both the ninth and 10th, and in between, the Raptors scored three runs aided by three LHS errors to claim the trip to state. \n\"It was a weird day. We played great for five and a half weeks, and you have a bad day of softball,\" Loveland coach Mike Felton said. \"No. 28 winning the region, and then 7 and 10 playing for a consolation. The way (Eaglecrest) lost the game before us, or else we would've been playing Chatfield. It was a weird day. That's why you play the game.\" \nThe only silver lining for the Indians is that all but one of their players returns next season, with senior catcher Braxton Morby the loss. \nMountain View was able to exorcise its demons from last year this year, so perhaps Loveland can do the same in 2016. \n\"To end it like this is really awful. I think next season we're going to learn from it and we're going to come back from it. I really hope that we do,\" said Reiger, who had a tremendous diving catch in left field in the loss to Chatfield. \n\"But, it happens. You get one day to be on, and we weren't on. Next year we have to know you've got to come to play that one day and advance to state.\" \nSean Star: 970-669-5050, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/seanvstar \n5A Region 7 State Qualifying Game \nAt Barnes Complex \nEaglecrest 001 321 0003 — 10 14 1 \nLoveland 032 200 0000 — 7 9 6 \nW — Kathleen Ingram.
