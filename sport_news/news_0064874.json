According to The New York Times , the proposal—which would need to overcome a veto threat from the city’s mayor—would make San Francisco the largest city in the U.S. to allow so-called Idaho stops, named for the state to have legalized them in the 1980s.\nLocal cycling advocates have differing opinions on whether they’d like to see rolling stops legalized in and around Boston.\nDoug Johnson, a community organizer with the Boston Cyclists Union, said the union would “definitely support” allowing cyclists to roll through stop signs after yielding to traffic and pedestrians, with some exceptions for busy intersections. Johnson said cyclists would benefit from shorter commute times, and drivers may as well .\n “We think, if implemented properly ... it would have no adverse effect on safety,” Johnson said. “Most intersections that have stop signs right now have low traffic volume and low traffic speed.”\nJohnson was cooler to the idea of allowing cyclists to ride through red lights after first making a full stop, a practice allowed in Idaho but not proposed in San Francisco, saying the union could only “potentially” get behind that idea.\n”It would be a lot more complicated to implement,” he said. “It’s definitely something that would be worth researching.”\nBut even though the union would support a rule shift, Johnson said it does not consider Idaho stops a priority. San Francisco was ripe for a policy debate because police had targeted stop signs, issuing tickets to violators. Boston cyclists do not currently have such an impetus to take action, he said.\n“It got a lot of attention, and they decided to make a stand on it,” Johnson said. “It’s kind of created the political will to create some change there.”\nIndeed, it’s hardly a secret of the streets that many cyclists already ride through stop signs and lights, usually without consequence.\nMassBike Executive Director Richard Fries said ”would not support” rolling stop rules here, in part for that reason. Boston’s bike culture still has a ways to go before all cyclists are following the existing rules, he said.\n“At this point of where we are in bike advocacy, it seems a rather abstract concept,” he said. “We’re still trying to get people to ride the right direction. We would like to see the rules enforced for everyone—cyclists, motorists, pedestrians. The idea of then adding this interpretation of law to the mix is questionable to me.”\nStill, Fries said he is interested in seeing what happens in San Francisco.\n“If you’re on a bike, there are a lot of intersections where it doesn’t make sense to be at a complete stop,” he said.\nBrookline Police flirted with the idea about a year ago when the department asked on Twitter how people would feel about enacting Idaho stop rules, if only during heavy commuting hours or on certain roads. The department later said it was seeking to start a conversation and its rules remained unchanged.\nMeanwhile in Boston, it’s unlikely the idea will come to the forefront any time soon.\n“No, this has not been considered, but the city of Boston will continue to research and implement policies and practices that make traveling enjoyable, safe and convenient,” said Bonnie McGilpin, a spokeswoman for Mayor Marty Walsh.\nThe best places to hike in Massachusetts:\nPrevious -- of -- Next Hike to the peak of Great Barrington’s Monument Mountain and look for the cave where a conversation between Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville inspired ideas for Moby Dick.
