Last year, the Bills led the NFL with 54 sacks. With just seven sacks to date, the Bills rank 27th in the NFL in sacks per pass attempt. 7 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nORCHARD PARK - At 32 years of age, weighing 303 pounds, with one and sometimes two offensive linemen who typically weigh more than 303 pounds blocking his path, it's already tough enough for Kyle Williams to sack a quarterback. \nNow factor in the quick passing game which the New England Patriots and New York Giants have employed with tremendous success in their victories over the Bills, and perhaps you see how difficult it has been for Williams and the rest of Buffalo's defensive line this season. \n\"Outside of the guy having a heart attack, I can't run 10 yards in 1.7 seconds with nobody in front of me,\" Williams said with a smile the other day. \nHis fellow defensive tackle, 331-pound Marcell Dareus, just shrugged his shoulders when he was asked about Eli Manning averaging 1.79 seconds to deliver the ball Sunday, fastest of any quarterback in any NFL game this season. \"They're getting the ball out faster than we can get there,\" said Dareus. \"I need at least two and a half seconds to do something.\" \nThe same holds true for ends Mario Williams and Jerry Hughes who have to travel further than the inside tackles to get to the quarterback while also dealing with a blocker and perhaps a running back or tight end chipping them on their way. \nThe Bills recorded 111 sacks in the last two seasons, the most in the NFL, and teams have taken notice. This year they have just seven, and only four of those have come from their very well-compensated defensive line. \nThe good news for the line, and the defense as a whole, is that not every team on the schedule can execute a quick passing attack the way Manning and Tom Brady can. And it would be a complete shock if Titans rookie Marcus Mariota can do it Sunday when he starts his fourth career NFL game against the Bills in Tennessee.

You're going to continue to get teams' best shots at duplicating that until we do something to stop it.\" \nWhat Brady and Manning did to the Bills was make sure the pass rush had no chance of creating havoc in the backfield, and they were clearly successful as Buffalo managed just three sacks for 16 yards combined in those games. On the flip side, it is coach Rex Ryan's opinion that by playing that way, teams have to scale back their offensive game plan because there's only so many plays you can use when you're throwing the ball in two seconds or less. \n\"Of course it's going to negate your pass rush, but there are other things, too,\" said Ryan. \"We can look at that game Eli played last week, they've got some good weapons. But if your best receiver in (Odell) Beckham, who is clearly one of the best receivers in the league, has 38 yards receiving on 12 targets, I will sign up for that.\" \nRyan harkened back to his days as Baltimore's defensive line coach in 2000 when the Ravens set an NFL record by allowing just 165 points in a 16-game schedule on the way to winning the Super Bowl. That great defense registered only 35 sacks, but it didn't matter because the Ravens generated pass rush pressure, were impossible to run against (60.6 yards per game), created 49 turnovers, and Ray Lewis and his crew were outstanding tacklers. \n\"If the ball comes out quick it limits you, so as long as you tackle well, you get off the field, and that's what it's about,\" said Ryan. \"If we go in and we don’t have a sack, that doesn’t matter to me. Sometimes sacks can be a misleading stat. If they want to just throw the ball out, run these nail screens, all that kind of stuff, so be it. As long as we tackle well and we are getting off the field, we are controlling the sticks on defense, I think that's the main thing.\" Buy Photo \nBills Marcell Dareus makes this stop on Giants Andre Williams on a 4th and short. (Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nThe Bills did a much better job on defense against the Giants than they did the Patriots, so perhaps that's a sign of progress. Brady gouged them for a franchise-futility record 466 yards passing, while Manning threw for just 212. And if not for one really bad play -- the 51-yard catch and run touchdown by Rashad Jennings where three Bills, most notably Nigel Bradham, missed tackles -- the Bills' numbers would have been much better, and they may have come back to win the game. \n\"We've been too up and down for sure,\" said Kyle Williams. \"There's a lot of things we have to clean up and not be streaky, and it's not really game to game, it's series to series. The Giants game in the second half, we played very well.\" \nIf the Titans try to replicate what New England and New York did, Mariota will have to be very good to succeed, and he realizes that. \"I'll do my best,\" the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 draft said. \"If I can get the ball out of my hands quickly it will help our entire offense out. They have good guys up front, guys who can really disrupt the game, so for me it's still playing within our offense and doing my best to execute it.\" \nCan he do it? Linebacker Manny Lawson isn't taking anything for granted. \n\"I wouldn't put anything past anyone; you're in this league for a reason, especially at the quarterback position,\" said Lawson. \"You play quarterback because not only can you throw the ball, but in his case he can run, so if he gets his reads and adjustments down and understands what we're throwing at him, he can get it off in two seconds. It'll be our job to disguise better and be sound in our technique. And we have to disrupt the receivers so they can't get into the route. If we can disrupt the routes, the quarterback has to pump and go to a second or third read and it gives our line time to get there.\" \nAnd that's all Dareus, Williams, Williams and Hughes need. \n\"Sacks are not overrated,\" Dareus said, straying a bit from what Ryan said. \"We've got to get them, that's what we're here for.\" \nMAIORANA@Gannett.com 7 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1RwK7e3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:56:39.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
