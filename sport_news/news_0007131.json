The Hope College men's and women's soccer teams are pairing up this weekend to benefit Purple Community®, Van Andel Institute’s grassroots fundraising program. A Saturday doubleheader at Van Andel Soccer Stadium will feature women's and men's matches and raise funds for cancer and Parkinson's disease research at Van Andel Institute in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Flying Dutchmen host Adrian College at 4:30 p.m., while the Flying Dutch face Albion College at 7 p.m. Both teams are supporting the cause by wearing purple jerseys during their games. The names of loved ones they chose to honor will be on the back of the jerseys. Purple Hope Soccer T-shirts will be sold during both games for $10. At halftime for both games, fans will have the opportunity to take a penalty kick to \"Kick for a Cure\" for $1. Other donations will be accepted. All proceeds will benefit Van Andel Institute and will help underwrite a summer internship for a Hope student at Van Andel Institute. Co-Athletic Director Tim Schoonveld said Hope is excited to once again partner with Van Andel Institute on Purple Games. \"There is a tradition of mutual support and appreciation between Hope College and the Van Andel family and the Institute,\" Schoonveld said. \"We are looking forward to a great day celebrating the impact that both Hope College and Van Andel Institute have in this community.\" Support the event by making a donation on the Purple Community website or at either soccer game. Tickets can be purchased in advance through Hope College Ticket Office at (616) 395-7890 or bought at the gate. They are $5 for adults and $3 for non-MIAA students 18 and younger.
