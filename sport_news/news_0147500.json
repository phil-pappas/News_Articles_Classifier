I mean, if anything, that would’ve made us fight harder. That’s just not true. We together just came to the conclusion that it just wasn’t — the timing wasn’t right. It didn’t feel right.”\nIn any case, don’t expect to hear from a regretful Romney anytime soon.\n“We made the right decision,” Ann Romney said.\nGallery: 100 years of Massachusetts’ governors\nPrevious -- of -- Next When is the 72nd governor in the history of the commonweatlh of Massachusetts.
