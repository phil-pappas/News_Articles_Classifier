PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Health insurance premiums for Minnesota residents buying coverage through MNsure or directly from providers will increase by as much as 49 percent on average next year, state officials announced Thursday, a major jump that the state’s top insurance regulator said calls for additional reforms to control costs. \nThe 2016 cost increases range from 14 percent for enrollees on a Medica plan to 49 percent for customers on Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, the state’s largest insurer. All eight companies selling insurance on the individual market posted double-digit percentage rate increases for next year. \nMost Minnesotans won’t feel the hit - less than 6 percent of residents buy insurance on the individual market, compared to more than 80 percent who are covered through employers or on public programs. But the individual market is at the heart of President Barack Obama’s health care law and the health insurance exchanges such as MNsure it gave way to. \nMinnesota Department of Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman called the increases “unacceptably high.” He said they were driven by a smaller, higher-cost pool of consumers than initially projected - a sentiment echoed by health care experts and the insurers themselves who have suggested prior years’ rates were too low. \n“We had rates that were not appropriate,” said Danette Coleman, Medica’s senior vice president for individual business. “Rates that we’re starting to see now really are more reflective of the risk that exists in the individual market.” \n___ Trial of indicted Minneapolis nonprofit head moved to 2016 \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - The federal fraud trial for a former Minneapolis nonprofit leader has been postponed until April. \nWilliam Davis and his son, Jordan, were supposed to stand trial in November on charges they siphoned public money for personal use or claimed expense reimbursements they weren’t permitted to. A revised schedule in the case was filed Thursday. \nProsecutors and defense attorneys agreed to push the trial back because complexity made earlier time limits “inadequate and unreasonable under the circumstances of this case,” according to the order. \nDavis led the now-closed Community Action of Minneapolis for years and has deep connections in state Democratic politics. The younger Davis is a Minneapolis police officer currently on administrative leave and had received paychecks from the community organization. Both have entered not guilty pleas. \n___ Dem Rep. Atkins skips run for Minnesota congressional seat \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Veteran Minnesota state Rep.
