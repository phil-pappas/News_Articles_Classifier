It was visible on the eve of their second round Ranji Trophy encounter against Punjab on Wednesday.\nHome captain Aditya Tare was frank enough to admit the lessons he and his team had learnt from the previous game and that they won't look to repeat them in the next when they take on Yuvraj Singh-led Punjab at Wankhede Stadium from Thursday.\n\"For me, a loss is a loss. I don't care who we lose to. Conceding the first innings is as good as a loss for me, be it against any opposition. Even if I lose to Jammu and Kashmir, I am equally hurt. I lose to Andhra, Karnataka or any team in domestic circuit, a loss is a loss,\" he said on the eve of the four-day game.\nAfter restricting Mohammed Kaif's Andhra to 244, Mumbai batsmen were bowled out for 237, losing three crucial points in the drawn game in Vizianagaram last week.\nMumbai, however, cannot afford to repeat the mistakes, especially when they are likely to take on a much superior side on all counts like Punjab. With the trend being these days, Mumbai won't go into the game as favourites even though they are playing in their own backyard.\n\"We have to learn the lessons, otherwise things won't go right. If we want to improve, we have to learn and better ourselves, play good cricket,\" said Tare, the wicket-keeper batsman.\nWhat are the lessons that Mumbai learnt from their previous game? \"For me, it's all about attitude. It's about discipline, it's about determination, it's about how much you love playing for Mumbai. How much pride you have in playing and winning a match for Mumbai. And if the guys tick those boxes, then I think we have a bright team ahead,\" he added.\nEven though Mumbai may not be in great form, one cannot just rule them out. It is a balanced side with a talented bunch of youngsters who have the ability to turn the game on its head. It is a matter of time and once they find the rhythm, it will be difficult to stop them. Consistency, however, will hold the key.\nTheir batting is quite balanced too. They have aggressors in skipper Tare, Shreyas Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav who can keep the scoreboard running. To cool a difficult situation, they can rely on the likes of opener Akhil Herwadkar, the experienced Abhishek Nayar and the reliable Siddhesh Lad. It is just that they have to get their act together to get going.\nOn the bowling front, too, they are a decent unit. An experienced Dhawal Kulkarni leads the attack comprising last season's joint highest wicket taker in Ranji â€“ Shardul Thakur. They have a good back-up in swing bowler Balwinder Singh Sandhu (Jr), who took five wickets in the last game. Left-arm spinner Vishal Dabholkar will have a role to play on the third and fourth days.\nMeanwhile, the Punjab will be eager to carry on their form from the last game in which they defeat Railways by an innings. Though they may have lost last match double centurion Gurkeerat Singh Mann for the ODIs against South Africa, they are still a strong side.\n\"Gurkeerat has been batting really well but I am happy that he has gone where he deserves to be (national ODI squad). So, this is an opportunity for the other guys to come in and bat, so that's good,\" said skipper Yuvraj.\nTheir batting will revolve around Yuvraj while youngsters like Mandeep Singh and Jiwanjot Singh will work in his shadows. Punjab's bowling too is decent with fast bowler Barinder Sran attracting maximum praise from his skipper for his speed skills.\nAll in all, it is going to be a one hot encounter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:44:56.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
