Kalamazoo Central has a lot of talent, so you want to get up on them early and not let them get going,\" Lakeview coach Matt Miller said. \"You want to take an early advantage anytime you can in high school football. Getting early starts is so huge in any game, and it was huge tonight.\" Lakeview's Skyler Nicholes advances the ball against Kalamazoo Central Friday evening.

From there, Spartans' quarterback Skyler Nichols dove in from the one to make it 7-0 with 9:35 left in the quarter. \nAfter a Lakeview interception by Roger Williams, the Spartans had the ball again and scored on a 24-yard touchdown run by Kemp to make it 14-0 at 7:02 left in the first. \nKemp added another touchdown on the next possession from three yards out and it was quickly 20-0 with 3:29 still left in the opening period. \nThe Spartan running game dominated the game as Lakeview's improving offensive line and athletic backs controlled the game. \n\"Our offensive line played tremendously and we came up with some big runs,\" Miller said. \"We have some special running backs and we said it would take a while to get our young offensive line going to break them free. But they are going now and we are seeing it pay off.\" \nKemp kept the offense humming with a 50-yard touchdown run to give Lakeview a 27-0 lead on the first play of the second quarter. The Spartans would go into halftime up 34-0 after a 31-yard touchdown run by Jay'Vion Settles. \nLakeview's C.J. Foster advances the ball against Kalamazoo Central Friday evening.

Our line has been coming around. We have more faith in our offensive line now and we are breaking some big runs because of it,\" Settles said. \nLakeview's defense came up big the entire night to get the shutout with William Dean, Justyn Jones and Justin Wright each coming up with big plays in the Kalamazoo Central backfield with sacks. \n\"Our defense has continued to improve all year. We played some pretty special teams early and gave up some points, but we played them tough. That experience has helped, we got the shutout tonight, we survived another week and we won, that's what it is all about,\" Miller said. \nLakeview improves to 4-2 on the season after two straight wins, following an early loss to Battle Creek Central. \n\"After we lost to Battle Creek Central, our kids focused up and we have had a pretty good couple of weeks since. Last week was a big win for our confidence over Stevensville-Lakeshore and tonight we built on that and got the job done again,\" Miller said. \nBill Broderick can be reached at bbroderi@battlecreekenquirer.com or 269-966-0678.
