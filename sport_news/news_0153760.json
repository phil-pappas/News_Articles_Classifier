Things just started happening, I think both teams got a little more confidence in their offense, and confidence says a lot,” City High Coach Dan Sabers said of the offenses in the second half. “In the first half we moved it some, we just weren’t able to finish it.” \nPrairie responded with a quick touchdown, but City High came back just as quick with touchdown run from senior Will Noack. Noack came off the bench and scampered 68 yards down the sideline to the end zone. \nCity High responded with another Jason Jones touchdown with 6:16 to play in the fourth quarter. \n“Jason is special and one of his best plays was a block he made on the last touchdown,” Sabier said. “That’s the kind of player Jason Jones is. He doesn’t take a play off and he goes hard every time. We’re very fortunate to have him.” \nThe block Jones made came with just over two minutes left to play when City High had the ball with a 21-14 lead. Taylor handed off to junior Bryce Frantz, who found plenty of room to run down the left side of the field. Frantz finished with more than 100 yards rushing. \nPrairie added a late touchdown, but City recovered the onside kick and ran out the clock. \n“Anytime you get a win, we’ve played these guys for years (City High played Prairie often in the Mississippi Valley Conference before the shift to district play was made last year),” Sabers said. “We always know their kids are hard-nosed, tough kids, and that’s what they were tonight. \n“So we feel really good about the win.” \nCity High hosts Burlington (1-5) Friday at Bates Field. \nClick here for more City High news.
