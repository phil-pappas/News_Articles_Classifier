Nevertheless, perhaps what remains even more exciting for the Wolfpack faithful is that Smith’s decision could just be the start of one of the greatest recruiting classes in NC State basketball history. \nUpon Smith’s commitment to NC State, recruiting sites began to speculate that fellow top-10 prospect Edrice “Bam” Adebayo, a power forward from High Point slotted as the No.6 overall prospect in the country, would likely follow Smith to State because of his relationship as a friend and teammate on Team Loaded NC of the AAU circuit. \nThen there’s Brooklyn native Rawle Alkins, who will play high school basketball in Raleigh this year at Word of God Christian Academy. Alkins, rated as the No. 16 overall prospect in 2016, is a high-flying guard from Brooklyn with loads of pro potential. \nIf Adebayo and Alkins were to join Smith at NC State next season, Gottfried would have secured the three highest prospects that he has ever successfully recruited to NC State. \nCopyright 2015 North Carolina State University.
