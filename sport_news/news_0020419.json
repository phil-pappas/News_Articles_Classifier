(Source: WAFB) BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - \nIf viewing this story on a mobile device or in an email, click the link for postgame coverage, including LSU head coach Les Miles' news conference - http://shout.lt/bf54r , LSU player interviews - http://shout.lt/bf54M \nNo. 6 LSU used a fake field goal to get past No. 8 Florida, 35-28 and remain unbeaten. The Tigers hand the Gators their first lost of the season. \nRunning back Leonard Fournette accounted for two of LSU's five touchdowns and had 180 rushing yards in the first two quarters. \nLSU quarterback Brandon Harris was 13 of 19 for 202 yards with 2 touchdown passes to wide receiver Malachi Dupre, including a 50-yard pass with 15 seconds left in the second quarter. \nLSU kicker Trent Domingue scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter, faking a field goal and running 16 yards into the endzone to give LSU the win, 35-28. \nHarris was coming off the best game of his career against South Carolina with 228 yards passing and 2 touchdowns. But the Gamecocks are 0-4 in the SEC and their defense ranks dead last in the conference. \nFlorida's defense presents a much different set of challenges, ranked near the top of the SEC and very opportunistic when the ball is in the air. \nScoring Plays: \nFlorida quarterback Treon Harris threw to Jake McGee for a 4-yard TD. (Florida 7, LSU 0 - 10:13 1st Qtr) \nLSU running back Leonard Fournette rushed for a 2-yard TD.
