There isn’t likely to be a lot of good defense in this game, but both teams are capable of putting points on the board. \n:: \nAtlanta (5-1) at Tennessee (1-4) \nSunday, 1 p.m. \nDirecTV: 707. \nLine: Falcons by 5. O/U: 47. \nWith or without Marcus Mariota, the Titans are overmatched by an Atlanta team loaded with offensive weapons.

O/U: Off the board. \nUncertainty at quarterback for the Steelers — will it be Ben Roethlisberger or Landry Jones? — but Pittsburgh has figured out how to win with either. Big return to KC for Steelers OC Todd Haley. \n:: \nHouston (2-4) at Miami (2-3) \nSunday, 1 p.m. \nTV: CBS. DirecTV: 710. \nLine: Dolphins by 5. O/U: 44 1/2. \nWith new coach at the helm, the Dolphins exorcised some demons with their 28- point road blowout of Titans. The Texans are hoping last Sunday’s victory jump-starts their season.

O/U: 47 1/2. \nThe Jets are closing the gap in this rivalry, and are playing hard for first-year Coach Todd Bowles.

O/U: 45. \nJerry Jones says that new Cowboys QB Matt Cassel will take some chances that Brandon Weeden didn’t take. That sounds like a recipe for turnovers.

O/U: 46. \nThe good news for the Eagles is they’re coming off a 20-point victory. The bad news is Sam Bradford was picked off three times.

O/U: 48. \nThe wind is out of the sails of the Ravens, who have lost five of six. The Cardinals are coming off two losses in three weeks and are itching to prove their fast start was no fluke.
