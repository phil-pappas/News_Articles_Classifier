The only way you can take ownership is if you play well.\" \nBurger has played 15 times for South Africa against New Zealand, winning five and losing 10, while Springboks head coach Heyneke Meyer this week described the current All Blacks as \"the best team ever.\" \nAsked if he agreed with his coach's comments, Burger added: \"I think we have to. Statistics prove that. \n\"I think Richie McCaw (New Zealand captain) has won more Test matches than I've played, almost, so it's pretty hard to compete against guys who never seem to lose. \n\"Again, I think they're a great side, but within our team there is quite a lot of belief. We've put them under pressure in the past. \n\"The big thing about them is that their attack is phenomenal. They back their execution and skill-set, so they put you under more pressure than any other team in the world. \n\"When we have beaten them, it starts with defence, not letting them have any tempo on the ball, trying to slow them down, but then we create a lot of opportunities. If we do get opportunities, we have to use all of them.\" \nThe relaxed mood in South Africa's camp - some of the players visited Chelsea's training facilities this week, while others have a keen eye on Sunday's one-day international cricket clash between South Africa and India - is in stark contrast to the fall-out from the shock Japan loss just 34 days ago. \nSpringboks skipper Fourie du Preez has no doubt that Saturday's clash can lay claim to be \"the biggest game in our lives,\" and for Burger, that will mean potentially a final head-to-head with McCaw, two of the game's greatest rugby union warriors. \nBoth look set to exit Test rugby after the World Cup, and Burger said: \"We have become good mates. We've played against each other since 2003, and there have been a fair few contests. Unfortunately, I have been on the losing side of most of them.\" \nAnd as for New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen's comment that South Africa will want to \"rip our heads off\" on Saturday, Burger added: \"Not at the moment. Maybe tomorrow.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:13:18.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
