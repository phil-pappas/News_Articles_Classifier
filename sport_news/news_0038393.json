The Indians have been on a roll this season, and are now 5-0. They’re ranked at No. 18 in the Boston Globe’s Top 20 poll and No. 22 on ESPNBoston.com’ ;s Top 25 poll. “Billerica came in as advertised – tough, athletic, well-coached and disciplined,” said Knights head coach John Dubzinski. “Give credit to them, they are a heck of a team.” Billerica took a 6-0 lead in the first quarter, but it was a 29-point second quarter that did the Knights in. Billerica quarterback Justin Beck threw touchdown passes to Dean Brooks, Jeff Trainor and Gus Gobiel during the fateful second quarter. Drew Landry had his second rushing touchdown of the game. The 35-0 Billerica halftime lead was insurmountable for the Knights. In the second half, North Andover outscored Billerica 13-7. Junior quarterback Seamus Lambert ran for an 11-yard score, and threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Chris Miller on the last play of the game. The second half was a positive in Dubzinski’s eyes. “There weren't many positives from this game, but we can hang our hat on the fact that our kids did not pack it in. They kept on giving 100 percent on each and every play, regardless of the score,” he said. The Knights were their usual selves in the offensive running game. They were unable to break any huge runs to affect the score, but they did compile 178 yards. Ryan Good earned 75 yards in 15 carries, while Joe Samuelman added 68 in 13 carries. “I am obviously disappointed with the result, but by the same token I’m so proud of the effort, not one person gave up,” said Dubzinski. “We need to build off of our effort, execute better, coach better and focus on solutions for our mistakes,” the coach added. The Knights have two games left on the schedule, before the playoffs are announced. North Andover will travel to Methuen Friday, and then host Lawrence on Oct. 23. There is also a Thanksgiving Day match-up against Andover looming that the Knights will host to begin the new holiday tradition. “Methuen just had a huge win over a very good Lawrence team, so they will be another challenge for us,” Dubzinski said. The 2-3 Rangers host North Andover Friday night. They’re coming off of a thrilling 27-21 victory over Lawrence. Page 2 of 2 - The Knights can learn a lot from the film of Methuen’s victory over Lawrence, because the Knights will also host the 2-3 Lancers in the regular season finale.
