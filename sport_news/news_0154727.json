Parents buy GA team safety gear in memory of their son (Photo: jeremy campbell) \nJohns Creek, Ga. - High school football games bring cheering fans, excited teams and often worried parents. \nHowever at Johns Creek High School every player got a safety upgrade on Thursday. \n\"Right now it is swag, but they won't know how beneficial this until they wear it,\" said Brian Haugen. \nHaugen is a football dad who never saw his son graduate. \n\"My son received a tackle from the front and back when he jumped up to catch a pass over his head, and it crushed his liver,\" explained his mother Kathy Haugen. \nThe impact was to Taylor Haugen's mid-section, an area poorly protected by helmets or pads. The Florida teen became unresponsive before arriving at the hospital. \nThat's where the Evoshield hopes to change things. The Georgia-made safety pads arrive vacuum sealed, but once the package opens they activate. Within ten to fifteen minutes the pad becomes rock hard, and form-fits to the player's body. \nIt creates custom protection, and it's free for the entire team. \n\"The shirt normally retails between eighty to one hundred bucks in stores so not every athlete might get before something of that nature,\" said athletic director Jason Holcomb. \nSince their son's death the Taylor Haugen Foundation outfitted more than three thousand players with this technology. Johns Creek High School is the first in Georgia that they've equipped. \nIt builds a sense of added safety for the Gladiators. \n\"We get great pleasure out of looking at the faces,\" Haugen said.
