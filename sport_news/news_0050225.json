At the time, it was known owner Stephen Ross was going to clean house at the end of the year, but Bowles welcomed the promotion from defensive coordinator to interim head coach for the final three games of the 2011 season.\n“You’re 13-14 weeks in and I’m not carrying heading coach material around,” Bowles was saying Wednesday. “You just have to adjust and manage the team as best you can and manage the coaches as best you can.”\nThe Dolphins went 2-1 under Bowles over those final three weeks. A 30-23 division win at Buffalo was followed by a narrow 27-24 loss at New England before closing with a 19-17 triumph over Rex Ryan’s Jets.\nDolphins defensive end Jason Taylor presented Bowles with a game ball after the victory in Buffalo to honor his first win as an NFL head coach, but it wasn’t long before the Dolphins named Green Bay offensive coordinator Joe Philbin as the franchise’s ninth head coach.\nFour seasons later, Bowles is in his rookie year as the Jets head coach while rumors are swirling in Miami that Philbin is on the brink of being fired.\nThe Jets are 2-1 and feeling optimistic, while the 1-2 Dolphins are desperate after consecutive losses to the Jaguars and the Bills. \n“It hasn’t been the type of football I envision us playing,” Philbin said after a 41-14 loss to Buffalo on Sunday in Sun Life Stadium. \nPhilbin is 24-27 in Miami and has yet to manage a winning season.\nNow here comes Bowles, whose lasting impression in Dolphins colors was being celebrated for beating the Jets. As we know, Bowles spent 2012 in Philadelphia where he started as the secondary coach but became the defensive coordinator by October when Juan Castillo was dismissed.\nHe spent the next two years as the defensive coordinator in Arizona before the Jets gave him the well-earned chance to be his own man again.\nBowles never has said a bad word about not getting the job in Miami. He said he was happy for the experience. \n“It helps you understand that there are things that are going to happen every day you’re going to have to deal with that have nothing to do with football,” he said of what he learned during those three games in Miami. “You get an overall feel for the managerial part of it. It helps you see things faster.”\nIt helped him be ready for the unexpected from the Jets. From Sheldon Richardson’s suspension to Geno Smith’s broken jaw to the logistics of playing a game in London, Bowles already has endured his share of unusual issues.\nAfter a 27-14 loss to the Eagles on Sunday at MetLife Stadium, this week would be better served focused entirely on football. But the Jets are preparing for their venture to Europe with seminars on sleeping and tips on wearing tinted glasses to aid eye stress.\n“This is another week where the schedule is a little different,” said cornerback Darrelle Revis. “We’ve just got to deal with it the best way we can.”\nPhilbin’s job could well be on the line on Sunday. It’s a big game for Bowles, too, a test of how he can get his team refocused after a loss amid the distraction of traveling to Europe. If the Jets win, the Dolphins may start to think they hired the wrong guy in 2012.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under joe philbin ,  miami dolphins ,  new york jets ,  todd bowles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:53:36.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
