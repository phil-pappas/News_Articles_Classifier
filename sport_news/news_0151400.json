It is a matter of the Sikhs,” he said, reacting to Opposition leader in Haryana Assembly Abhay Singh Chautala’s criticism of the decision. Chautala had on Wednesday said the dera chief did not deserve a pardon since he had hurt the sentiments of the Sikhs. The dera chief said the Panj Piaras were authorised to take the decision at their own level and didn’t require any one’s advice on matters related to the community. The Takht had last month granted the sect chief pardon for presenting himself in attire similar to that of Guru Gobind Singh in 2007. The dera chief made his first public statement on the pardon while interacting with mediapersons at the promotion of his film “MSG-2-The Messenger” here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:10:40.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
