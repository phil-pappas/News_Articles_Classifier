We haven’t been at the maximum at any point, but we had to be careful driving in difficult conditions,” said Latvala, the first Finn to win in Corsica since Markku Alen back in 1984.\nLast year’s French round was held in the Alsace region and Latvala also won that.\nVolkswagen has already secured both the manufacturers’ and drivers’ titles, with France’s Sebastien Ogier clinching his third successive crown in Australia last month.\nOgier was hampered by a 10-minute penalty in France after he failed to finish Friday’s leg but won Sunday’s final power stage.\nFrance was the first rally since Europe’s biggest carmaker was hit by an emissions scandal and Volkswagen team principal Jost Capito said the company’s world rally championship program would not be affected.\n“The Volkswagen WRC team could not have been more successful, winning three back-to-back World Championships,” he said.\n“We have a green light for the project up to and including 2019, and are working hard to ensure we remain as successful as possible on the sporting front.”\nVolkswagen has announced it is setting aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.29 billion) to help cover the cost of the scandal after it was revealed the firm had used software to manipulate emissions tests. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:01:01.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
