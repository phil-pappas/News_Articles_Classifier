Sanchez has racked in 23 goals in 12 games so far this season. He scored 3 against Ruidoso, Hatch Valley and Roswell, 4 against Portales and an impressive 6 against Robertson. However, the most important goals Sanchez has scored came this week when he knocked in 3 to tie a very powerful Roswell squad. Scoring goals against your rival high school is always an exciting thing to do. This week, Leilani Baker knocked in 2 to give the Rams a victory over rival Cleveland Storm. Baker has scored multiple goals in two other games this year, against Cibola and Onate. Baker has scored 9 goals on the season, 4 coming in district play, making her a top player in her district. \nRankings powered by First Financial Credit Union Talk about it in NEW MEXICO PREP FOOTBALL INSIDER FEATURED PRODUCTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:17:18.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
