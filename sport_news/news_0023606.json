Carroo missed the whole fourth quarter. Agudosi, who didn't play one snap against Washington State or in the fifth game against Michigan State, appeared to be headed for a third game without a snap when Carroo was hurt. \nWhen Rutgers offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels asked if he was ready, Agudosi said yes, jumped on an exercise bike, caught a few passes from third-string quarterback Giovanni Rescigno on the sideline and then took the field for the first possession of the fourth quarter. \nHe hauled in a 40-yard pass from quarterback Chris Laviano to give Rutgers first-and-goal at the Indiana 3. Running back Robert Martin scored on the next play to cut Indiana's lead to 52-46 with 9:26 remaining. \nThe 6-foot-6 Agudosi came up big again on the final drive. With the score tied at 52, Rutgers faced a third-and-6 at its own 48 when Laviano hit Agudosi on a comeback route for 16 yards. The two connected later in the drive for another 16-yard gain on a crossing pattern on a third-and-four that moved the ball to the Indiana 14 that set up Kyle Federic's game-winning field goal as time expired. \"Maturity is a good word (to describe Agudosi's strength),\" coach Kyle Flood said. \"Mentally tough is another expression for a guy like that to be able to stay in the game when you are not necessarily playing every play in the game and understanding also that No. 4 (Carroo) is a pretty good player. Certainly no shame in the fact that when No. 4 is out there he's one of the best players in college football as well,.\" Flood added, \"Carlton did a good job. He did exactly what we tell every player to do you. You have to be ready when your number is called not just be ready to go into the game and perform like a starter and Carlton did that on Saturday. \n\"It's probably one of the best examples I've been around where a guy being ready and going in and performing at a high level, making an explosive play and giving us an opportunity to kick that field goal on the last drive. A lot to build on there, not just for Carlton but for a lot of players.'' \nRunning backs coach Norries Wilson, who served as interim head coach as Flood served a three-game suspension, was actually moved to tears when talking about Agudosi's unselfish approach. Laviano said he'd put in as much time with Agudosi as any of his receivers, and simply said Agudosi was a team player who has done all he can. \"You have to have the mindset in the business where you never know when your number is gonna be called. If I were to approach it any other way it would be unhealthy for my game and my team,\" said Agudosi. \"I guess it might come from my parents who tell me 'stay ready, stay ready,' my high school coach, coach (Lou) Solomon told me 'stay ready.'\" \nAdded Agudosi, \"I'm for the team, I can't say it's easy, I'm a competitor and in my heart I feel I'm one of the best receivers in the Big Ten, but I haven't had the chance to really prove it, but my confidence level and thinking what I could do hasn't changed.\" Carroo is questionable for Saturday night's 8 p.m. game against No. 1 Ohio State, so it's possible Agudosi will get a huge chance -- this time at High Point Solutions Stadium in Piscataway. ABC is broadcasting the game. \"The situation is what it is,\" said Agudosi. \"I'm not even focusing on that. I'm just focusing on being the best receiver I can be, so whenever I do get the opportunity, I can really make plays and make things happen. I'm not focusing on that because that's not going to get me anywhere. \n\"My mindset doesn't change. I have to have a great week of practice. I have to prepare every day in practice to go out there just in case he goes down and he can't go or my or my number is called.'' 4 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LHbql4 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:15:28.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
