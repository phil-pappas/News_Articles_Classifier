He is accused with knowingly making a false statement to obtain a hunting license. \nGroup member Barb Murray hopes the case raises awareness about such hunting practices. Murray also wants Stoner to apologize, pay a large fine and contribute to conservation in the province. \nStoner’s case is set for Nov. 13. A lawyer appearing in court on his behalf says he does not know how the player will plead. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:29:25.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
