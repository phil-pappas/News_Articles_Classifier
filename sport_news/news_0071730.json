(J. Anthony Roberts) Comments \nAMHERST – In Mid-American Conference play last year, the University of Massachusetts football team had one of the league's best offenses. \nThe Minutemen averaged over 30 points as it was, but before Blake Frohnapfel was lost for the final two games with a broken leg, that average was tops in the MAC at over 36 points per game. The offense had show some impressive sparks during out-of-conference play, but against the MAC it had finally started to turn into wins. \nFrohnapfel was slinging it, Shadrach Abrokwah and Lorenzo Woodley – don't look for them now – were salvaging a once-struggling running game and the offense was giving fans hope for 2015. \nFast-forward to this season and that hope is gone. Against Kent State Saturday, so too was that exciting offense. \nUMass scored only one touchdown in its 15-10 homecoming loss , totaling just 257 yards and 13 touchdowns. Frohnapfel, who didn't get much help from his offensive line and again struggled with accuracy, looked more like the first-time Minuteman making his debut against Boston College than the reigning first-team All-MAC quarterback. \nWas it poor execution? Poor preparation? Poor play calling? Try all of the above. \n\"Give Kent State's defense a lot of credit, they did a nice job and I didn't have a very good plan,\" coach Mark Whipple said. \"They mugged us and they did a good job. That was the key to the game. I have to do a better job. Our defense stepped up and special teams were alright on both sides, but their defense was better than our offense today.\" \nWhipple pulled an awful lot out of his playbook. On one drive, UMass masqueraded as a power-running unit. On others, Whipple dialed up (failed) trick plays calling for passes from Ross Comis and A.J. Doyle. \nBut mostly, it was Frohnapfel feeling the Kent State pass rush and missing on throws. It resulted in seven punts, a nearly 13-minute deficit in time of possession and exactly zero points in the second half despite a defensive effort that kept giving the ball back to the Minutemen with time on the clock. Dan Malone & Mark Chiarelli Break Down UMass' Homecoming Loss To Kent State Dan and Mark share their thoughts about what went wrong the Minutemen's 15-10 loss Saturday. \nNeeding to drive 66 yards in two minutes for a potential game-winning touchdown, the offense produced a nothing run, two drops and a fourth-down pass sailed high over Tajae Sharpe's head. \nWe only scored one touchdown. Credit Kent State. I told the players I have to do a better job. Their plan was a lot better than ours and it played out. I'm disappointed for the kids, they practiced well and they prepared well the last two weeks and one side of the ball didn't show up tonight and it was the offense. \n\"For me personally, it was one of those days. You have them sometimes. You don't want it on a game day but that's what happened,\" Frohnapfel said. \"I was kind of out of sync in some way or inaccurate and missed passes I normally don't miss.\" \nFrohnapfel pointed to poor starting field position late in the game, saying those situations limited what UMass could do offensively. He also credited a Golden Flashes defense, which ranks first in the MAC in yards allowed, for taking away Sharpe and getting the offense off its game. \n[ ALSO READ: Was UMass quarterback Blake Frohnapfel playing hurt against Kent State? Mark Whipple says no ] \n\"With the way their defense is set up, it eliminates a lot stuff that's the core of our offense. It's just the way they play defense. Credit to them,\" he said.\"They do a lot of different stuff. There's plays we had there where it would've worked out and I was inaccurate or something happened. It was a thing where all 11 guys weren't on the same page.\" \nAnd it's happening with alarming frequency this season. \n\"Last year, there were times when we were really clicking and scoring 40 points or whatever it was. This year, we've had times when we've faltered a little bit,\" he said. \"A lot of that falls on me. I'm the quarterback in a pass-happy offense. When we're not doing as well, a lot of the responsibility falls on me. I'll take responsibility for that.\" \nWhipple, as he has on more than a few occasions, lamented the team's inability to get strong performances from all phases at the same time. When the offense has been up, the defense has been down or vice versa. Even within just the offense itself, he said \"we probably have to be a little more balanced.\" \n\"We just have to play one good game together. We've played one good game together and that's when we won,\" he said. \"The offense did all right last week, defense didn't. The offense wasn't very good this week. We just have to play better.\" \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:35:45.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
