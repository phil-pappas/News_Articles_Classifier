The bye week is over and it is time to refocus and get back into game mode.\nThe bye gave everyone a chance to relax and unwind after a rough previous week and the drama that came with it after the Michigan State game.\nSome chose to spend the weekend with family at the apple orchard, haunted house or some other activity outside of watching football. Many of us, though, were able to view the week's action without a vested interest in what was really going on.\nIn watching other teams play and really taking a step back and looking at the big picture, it has become easier to dissect what Michigan has been able to do so far.\nThrough seven games, the Wolverines boast arguably the best defense in the country. There is enough of a sample size there and the numbers back that up. Many expected that unit to be great this season, but to be flat-out elite has been extremely impressive.\nMichigan has had a chance to win every game they play with the defense they have. It has been that good.\nOffensively is where the struggles have come. The eyeball test backs that up for even the most casual fan.\nEarly on in the game between Michigan State and Indiana, Hoosiers quarterback Nate Sudfeld was picking apart the MSU secondary that is young and banged up, something that U-M was unable to do.\nThe Wolverines left points and chunk yards on the field against MSU and Jake Rudock was unable to exploit their defensive backs. In a lot of ways, that is a microcosm of the season so far.\nMichigan has not struggled against inferior opponents. In fact, they have gone out and dominated each of those games. Against nationally ranked teams like Utah and MSU, the lack of a downfield passing game has been the Wolverines' Achilles heel.\nIt remains to be seen if that is something that can be fixed or not, but for now, it is what it is.\nSo what does it mean for the rest of the season?\nU-M has four straight winnable games on its schedule before top-ranked Ohio State comes to town to end the regular season on Nov. 28. It starts this Saturday on the road against a downtrodden Minnesota team.\nThe Gophers came into the Big House last year and embarrassed the Wolverines in all phases of the game. Though, many will remember that game as the one where Michigan embarrassed itself with the handling of the Shane Morris incident.\nRegardless, Michigan is in a great spot to reclaim The Little Brown Jug and win its games vs. Rutgers and at Indiana and Penn State. After a week to regroup, it would not be a surprise to see them come out on fire and as hungry as ever as early as Saturday night.\nThe Wolverines sit at No. 15 in the AP poll, which is probably ahead of where they were expected to be at this point before the season. It is still a work in progress, and they are not without flaws, but Michigan has proven they can hang with the big boys.\nTheir final exam comes in the form of a visit from the Buckeyes in late November. We will have to wait and see the progress that is made from here on out.\nWho knows? If the right breaks go their way, a win over Ohio State could send them to Indianapolis to play for a Big Ten title.\nChances are low, but we have seen crazier this season so far.", "external_links": ["http://mailto:abroome1110@gmail.com/", "http://www.maizenbrew.com/"], "published": "2015-10-26T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:22:28.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
