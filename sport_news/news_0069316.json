Like I said last week, I feel like we're getting better every week and he does a good job of adapting really to what the game needs as far as what we need to get done offensively. But he does a good job of staying calm and working through the call sheet and trusting his preparation. That's been huge for us.\" \nMcCown completed 36 of his 51 throws for 457 yards and two touchdowns in the win over the Ravens. The 457 yards were a single-game franchise record, surpassing the previous mark of 444 collected by Brian Sipe against the Baltimore Colts on October 25, 1981. \nMcCown has increased his passing yards in each of the last three weeks, and his total of 1,154 combined between starts against the Oakland Raiders, San Diego Chargers and Ravens are the most in a three-game stretch by any quarterback in Browns history. \n\"I can't say enough about the way the offense prepared and played (Sunday),\" Browns head coach Mike Pettine said. \"Josh obviously had a career day and that's a function of a lot of things, and as I've talked about before, if you want your quarterback to play well, you gotta play well around him and I thought that Flip put together a great game plan. \n\"For us to be successful against their defense, we knew it was going to be tough sledding to run the football, especially early so we knew our success was going to come through the pass game. Offensively, we were able to execute. It was impressive how well we played around those guys and a total team effort. I thought the O-line blocked well, we caught the ball, so again, I know Josh is going to get heaped with praise and it's well-deserved, but I just think that we functioned well as a unit.\" \nUnder DeFilippo's direction, over the last three games, McCown has completed 96 of his 141 attempts, increased his average yards per play by two yards per throw, and tossed six touchdowns against only one interception. \n\"It's been tremendous,\" Pettine said of McCown's production. \"He's a guy you root for, but a big thing to talk about is understanding how well we're playing around him. The backs have stepped their game up. The offensive line is improving. The receivers are playing well. Just to have a guy that can be that calming influence, he doesn't get too up; he doesn't get too down. He's always very positive on the sideline. \n\"He'll be the first one to criticize himself and say he missed a throw or he missed a read or missed a change in the protection or getting us in the right place. His success, while on the outside in the building is surprising, the people that were here in the spring with him and watched him through training camp and just how he handed his business, we knew if we played well around him that he was capable of this.\" \nPettine sees McCown's improvement on the field as a function of DeFilippo's ability to make adjustments, both in-game and from week to week, ones that allow the offense to take advantage key matchups. \n\"The one thing I learned about him very quickly when I hired him is just it's the combination of passion and football intelligence,\" Pettine said of DeFilippo. \"When a play breaks down, he knows immediately why it happened. He's very good at troubleshooting. He's very good at understanding defenses and what they're trying to take away and how to take advantage of it and how we can get our guys in the right position to make plays. \n\"Game day, he does a great job. I think he has his moments, every once in a while, you know hot-blooded Italian like myself, but for the most part, he's even-keel and he's thinking ahead. Then, in-between series, I think he does a good job of getting into the prints with the quarterbacks and getting feedback from the rest of the staff on what went wrong, what we need to fix and what we like for an upcoming series.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LAKT8N TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:32:04.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
