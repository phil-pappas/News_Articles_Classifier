Both were expected to arrive in Toronto on Thursday night after a flight from Phoenix.\n“Hopefully they come in and go right back out Friday,” Daniels said. Having the players nearby would allow an easy swap onto ALDS roster as injury replacements if needed.\nBeltre walked in his first-inning at bat Thursday, then slid into second base on an inning-ending grounder to second by Prince Fielder.\nBeltre singled in his next at-bat, a fourth inning poke that brought home a run. But the all-star third baseman barely made it down to first base, almost tiptoeing as he ran.\n“We knew, we knew from our trainers, we got the information during the game … after that (slide into second base), it looked like he put everything he had in that final at-bat,” Daniels said.\n“It’s remarkable that he got that swing, but I’ve been watching that from Adrian for five years, that’s the kind of person and player he is.”\nDaniels and the Rangers are not out of the woods with Beltre yet; if he is unable to respond to treatment and play Friday, he could be replaced on the roster, likely by Gallo.\nDaniels called that a last resort. If removed for injury, Beltre would not be eligible for the remainder of the ALDS. He could return for the championship series, if the Rangers advance.\n“I wouldn’t rule him out play (Friday),” Daniels said.\nMore on thestar.com\nFive in Blue Jays’ Game 1 loss\nOdor hurts Jays in field, on base and at bat: Griffin", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:42:30.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
