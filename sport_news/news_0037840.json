Pleasant News \nNEW LONDON — The New London volleyball team cruised through their first round opponent in Tuesday night’s district tournament opener. The Tigers hosted Maharishi, and came away with the 3-0 sweep, winning 25-4, 25-4 and 25-3. \nBreanna Mettler led New London in kills, tallying nine in the win. Brandi Allen finished with five; Kenadi Schulte had four, and Josten Boyer, Ashley Birdsell and Emma Pry each had two. Pry also had 19 assists to lead the team. \nBoyer and Pry each had huge days serving for the Tigers. Boyer finished 31-32 with 16 aces and Pry was 17-17 with 10 aces. Schulte had a nice day herself, going 13-13 with six aces. \nThere weren’t as many digs to be made due to the high number of aces, but Pry finished with four to lead the team. Carson McSorely had three; Schulte had two; and Mettler, Allen and Camryn Blint each finished with one. \nThe Tigers will move on to the second round, next Tuesday, Oct. 27, at 7 p.m., but they won’t know who their opponent is until tomorrow. Sigourney and Tri-County will play tonight in Sigourney for the chance to travel to New London in the next round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:02:30.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
