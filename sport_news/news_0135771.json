He is defending his position and he is sure that he will be found not guilty.\" \nBlatter and Platini were handed 90-day suspensions after the Swiss Attorney General opened criminal proceedings against Blatter over a Â£1.35m payment to Platini. \nThe payment was made in February 2011 for work the Frenchman carried out as Blatter's technical advisor more than nine years previously, between 1999 and 2002. \nIssa Hayatou, president of Africa's football confederation, the CAF, is FIFA's acting president, while Angel Villar Llona is in line to be acting UEFA president. The Spaniard also has an ethics committee investigation hanging over him for refusing to co-operate properly with the inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. \nThe timing of the provisional ban could hardly be worse for Platini, who wanted to run in the election to succeed Blatter as president, but with nominations closing on 26 October those plans lie in ruins. \nUEFA's 54 member associations will convene next Thursday in Nyon to discuss the crisis, and there is expected to be an emergency FIFA executive committee meeting in Zurich the following week. \nFootball Association chairman Greg Dyke has said the governing body will drop its support for Platini if the ethics committee decides there has been any wrongdoing. \nDyke said: \"If the ethics committee reaches a conclusion that Mr Platini has not behaved properly or has behaved dishonestly then of course the FA will not support him. \n\"That's why we said in our statement that we are awaiting the results of the investigation - we need to see the evidence. I can see why people are saying we should stop supporting him now, but we will follow what the ethics committee decides. \n\"Platini claims it's a fix, but if they decide he has behaved improperly we will not support him and I'm sure I would have the backing of the FA board on that.\" \nDyke added that if there was any finding of wrongdoing by the investigations into the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups he was convinced there would have to be a re-vote.
