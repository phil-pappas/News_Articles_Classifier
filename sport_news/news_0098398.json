In an interview Wednesday with ESPN , Sherman said Thursday night games go against the league's proclaimed commitment to player safety. (Video via Nike ) \nSaid Sherman : \"Any time you play a football game and play another one a few days later, it's going to be tough on the body. But it's just another one of those things. Another one of those simple contradictions of the league because they care about us.\" \nIf you missed Sherman's dripping sarcasm, other players have been a lot more blunt about quick Thursday turnarounds. Players' recovery time between games gets cut in half compared to a Sunday game. (Video via WEBN ) \nTexans Pro-Bowler Duane Brown said in 2013 playing on Thursday \"feels horrible.\" In 2014, Packers guard Josh Sitton said Thursday games are \"stupid.\" And just last month, Giants linebacker Jon Beason said \"TNF\" shows the league \"[doesn't] really care about the players.\" \nSo with all the hate, why are Thursday night games still around? For one thing, the NFL points out how per-game injury rates are actually slightly lower for Thursday games than on other days of the week. Then, of course, there's the revenue it generates. \nIn 2014, CBS agreed to a deal that gave it national rights to just eight of the 14 Thursday night games that year — with, by the way, all of those broadcasts simulcast on NFL Network — and the network still forked over a reported $275 million. \nIf you're scoring at home, that's over $34 million per nationally broadcast game. \nCBS execs knew what they were doing, though. What they lost in rights fees, they gained in ad revenue — and then some. The network renewed its deal with the NFL for this year, and a 30-second ad on TNF now costs over half a million dollars . \nAnd those numbers don’t include the NFL's biggest Thursday of them all, Thanksgiving Day, which features three nationally televised games. \nSo it doesn't look like \"TNF\" is going away as long as there's still money to be made. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:31:26.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
