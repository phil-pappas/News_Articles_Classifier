Everybody goes through ups and downs it’s just: how are you going to react from it?” \nCentral Catholic’s reaction on Tuesday didn’t do the trick as the team game plan went out the window once a deficit presented itself, according to Car. \nRAPID RECAP : Parkland boys soccer team charges past Central Catholic in 2nd half \n“They weren’t following the script; they weren’t following the process of ‘How can we get back into this game?’” the coach said. “I think too many guys were doing their own thing out there to get us back in (the game). That’s not going to happen against good teams.” \nAfter Parkland ’s outburst, the Vikings didn’t muster much to trouble Trojans reserve goalkeeper Matthew Lytle. \n“You have to stay as a team the whole game,” Car said. “We just didn’t do that.” \nThe Vikings will need to rebound quickly, after going 0-2-1 in their last three results, in order to secure a spot in the conference tournament. Handling the adversity now can fortify Central Catholic for when challenges arise down the road. \n“We don’t want to be trending down heading into the postseason,” Car said. “The biggest thing for them is to stay positive, keep moving forward and just believe that we’re going to get better from this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:10:11.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
