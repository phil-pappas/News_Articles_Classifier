He's aware of how big a role they play for him and all the success he is enjoying.\" \nRonaldo, in his seventh season with Real, earlier this month became his club's all-time top scorer. \nHe has 324 goals, one more than former Real captain Raul. \n\"Cristiano is continuing to set new records,\" Benitez said. \n\"Obviously we're talking about a player with a lot of talent and quality, and to surpass Raul as the club's all-time top goalscorer says it all. \n\"We're talking about a player who is not only smashing records, but who is still hungry for more, full of ambition and capable of improving on his figures even further.\" \nRonaldo, meanwhile, is hungry for more. \n\"It's a special moment in my sporting life,\" he told Real Madrid TV. \n\"I had never even considered winning it four times. Maybe once or twice, but never four. \n\"Being the first in history to do so makes me feel all the more proud. \n\"I'm at the biggest club in the world and for that reason, we have to set our sights on winning every trophy possible.\" \nReal have not won La Liga since the 2011-12 season. \n\"I can guarantee that I'll give my all for this shirt and will try to win more team and individual trophies to give the fans lots to shout about,\" Ronaldo said. \n\"This is going to be a really good year for us, both collectively and individually.\" \nReal are unbeaten in La Liga and second in the standings, one point adrift of league leaders Villarreal after seven games. \nLos Blancos have won their opening two Champions League games, scoring six times without conceding a goal.
