(AP) — Rafael Gaglianone made a 46-yard field goal with four seconds left after missing from 39 yards just over a minute earlier, giving Wisconsin a 23-21 victory over Nebraska on Saturday. \nFullback Andy Janovich broke a 55-yard touchdown run with 3:38 left to give Nebraska the lead, but the Cornhuskers (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) for the second straight week couldn’t put away their opponent. All four of Nebraska’s losses have come on its opponent’s final offensive play. \nThe Huskers, protecting a one-point lead, played it safe after Gaglianone hit the right upright with his field-goal try with 1:26 left. Wisconsin (4-2, 1-1) got the ball back at its 30 with 1:03 to play and drove to the Nebraska 28, where Gaglianone lined up for his game-winner on third down. \nDare Ogunbowale rushed for 117 yards, most coming after starting Wisconsin running back Taiwan Deal went out with an injury to his left ankle in the first quarter. Joel Stave was 25 of 50 for 322 yards and a touchdown for the Badgers. \nThe Badgers played a turnover-free game a week after Stave committed four in a 10-6 loss to Iowa. The Huskers were coming off a 14-13 loss at Illinois. \nTommy Armstrong Jr. completed 11 of 28 passes for 129 yards and a TD and ran eight times for 50 for the Huskers, who are off to their worst start since 1959. Janovich and Terrell Newby each rushed for 59 yards. \nGaglianone’s 45-yard field goal pulled Wisconsin within 14-10 late in the third quarter, and the Badgers went up 17-14 on Alec Ingold’s 1-yard run. \nAnother Gaglianone field goal, this one from 42 yards, put the Badgers ahead 20-14 with 6:17 left. \nNebraska came back to regain the lead, with Armstrong scrambling for 16 yards on a third-and-15 three plays before Janovich busted his long TD run. \nWisconsin moved from its 9 to the Nebraska 21 in nine plays before Gaglianone pushed his 39-yard try off the upright. \nThe Badgers got the ball back after Nebraska went three-and-out, and Stave then drove the Badgers into position for Gaglianone’s winning kick. \nThe game matched first-year coaches in Nebraska’s Mike Riley and Wisconsin’s Paul Chryst. Riley gave Chryst his first paid assistant’s job in 1991 in the old World League of American Football, and Chryst later worked for Riley with the San Diego Chargers and at Oregon State. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:27:13.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
