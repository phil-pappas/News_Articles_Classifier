Huge gaps in the stands and no atmosphere or emotions whatsoever in the stadium.\n\"We want to show in the remaining 85 minutes what the alternative is and what a living fan culture means for football. We call on all Bayern fans to take part in the action. It's about all of us.\"\nIt said prices, not only for the Arsenal game, but for the German champions' other away matches in Europe were too expensive, with 50 euros a ticket for their Champions League group game at Olympiakos in Greece and 40 euros for the Dinamo game in Zagreb.\nBayern are one of the richest clubs in the world with an annual turnover of more than half a billion euros.\nNews of the proposed protest at The Emirates Stadium coincides with the publication of a BBC survey on ticket and other football-related prices in England.\nThe analysis found Arsenal's match-day tickets were the most expensive in the country, priced at up to 97 pounds (131.55 euros), while away fans pay between 26 pounds (35.26 euros) and 64 pounds.\nBayern's cheapest season ticket in the Bundesliga, where standing is still allowed, is 140 euros (103.15 pounds). The cheapest seats cost 340 euros (250.50 pounds).\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:55:13.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
