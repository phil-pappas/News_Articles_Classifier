Mitchell says the decision is all about developing the young Timberwolves for the future. \nThe 20-year-old LaVine is entering his second season in the league. He won the dunk contest at All-Star weekend as a rookie, but has impressed Mitchell with his work ethic in training camp. \nLaVine gets the nod over the 32-year-old Kevin Martin, one of the best shooters in the NBA. \nMitchell says he understands if Martin is not happy with the decision. But he expects Martin to continue to be a professional and compete. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:24:18.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
