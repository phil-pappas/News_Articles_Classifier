In professional football, there's a certain magic to it - it's a number receivers look at and target. \nThe Ottawa RedBlacks are looking to boldly go to a place just one CFL team, in two separate seasons, has gone before - getting through a season with four receivers gaining at least 1,000 yards in pass receptions. \nWhile Chris Williams is third in the CFL with 1,044 yards, three teammates are nipping at the 1,000-mark with a good chance to reach it over the final three regular-season games - the first in Winnipeg Saturday, then back-to-back matches with the Hamilton Ticats. Brad Sinopoli is at 886, Ernest Jackson is at 868 and Greg Ellingson is at 807. \nTwice, the Montreal Alouettes had four receivers reach the 1,000 mark. In 2004, Ben Cahoon (1,183), Jeremaine Copeland (1,154), Thyron Anderson (1,147) and Kwame Cavil (1,090) all reached 1,000. In 2005, it was Kerry Watkins (1,364), Terry Vaughn (1,113), Cahoon (1,067) and Dave Stala (1,037). \nAn Ottawa CFL team has never had even three 1,000-yard receivers in the same season. The last time they had two was 1996 - Joseph Rogers and Robert Gordon. \n\"It's all about team, but you have to have goals for yourself,\" said RedBlacks receivers coach Travis Moore, who, as a player, reached the 1,000-yard mark five times, including 1,431 in 2000 with the Calgary Stampeders. \"Anyone who ever played receiver, running back, quarterback, you have to have individual goals. But the main goal is to win the Grey Cup.\" \nIt's not like it's weighing on the players' minds. \n\"There's nothing we can really do about it,\" said Sinopoli. \"If the ball's coming your way, you make the catch and you get as many yards as you can. Half the time, you don't even realize how many yards you have until afterwards. You don't really think about it until people bring it up and say, 'Hey, you can have four receivers who can go over 1,000 yards.'\" \n\"As a receiver, in the football world, everybody kind of has goals,\" said Ellingson. \"You set the mark at 1,000 and hope you get there and in the process of getting there, you want to help your team win. If we have four guys do that, it's impressive. It's a testament to how good this team is - the linemen, Hank, (QB Henry Burris), everyone. \n\"At the end of the season, you can look back and say you had 1,000 yards. It's something people keep track of. It almost seems like a bit of a mirage to me. I haven't reached 1,000 yards yet in any league. In the AFL (Arena Football League), I got three yards away and then I came up to Hamilton. I've always wanted it. We're just going to keep playing the way we play and hopefully in the next three games, I hope I get there.\" \nThere's plenty of credit to go around, but certainly the offensive scheme, the play calling of offensive co-ordinator Jason Maas and the superb play of 40-year-old Burris have all been huge factors. \n\"The stuff that coach Maas brought in complements all of us,\" said Sinopoli. \"There are different guys at different times that are targeted. If one or two guys are being taken away in a game, the other guys are open and are getting their catches. That's kind of the way it's been going all year; guys have been taking their turns having big games. It's not like we just rely on one or two guys.\" \nThe other starting receiver, Maurice Price, is another key to making this all work. Price has 50 catches for 503 yards. Plus, the RedBlacks have utilized their running back effectively in the passing game. \n\"It's shows the versatility, the depth and the playmaking, it's coach Maas and Hank letting all of us eat,\" said Williams. \"You can't just prepare for one guy on our team. At any given moment, you could get the ball. It could be your turn to make a play. Guys have been selfless and when you do that, individual accolades come. I knew coming in there would be some sacrificing involved because of the amount of talent we had. We've been killing it, it's been crazy good. \n\"There's also some good fortune involved. We've only missed two games and that was the two I missed. We've also got guys like Pat Lavoie who step in and give us that extra bit of weaponry.\" \nMoore says the receivers have bought into what's expected of them and have bonded on and off the field. \n\"We don't have any selfish guys, these guys are playing together - they're like brothers,\" he said. \"Chemistry is a big part of it. They know each other on and off the field. It shows on the field. They trust and it's all about trust.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:45:30.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
