(AP) - A state lawmaker who questions whether Dartmouth College has sufficiently repaid the state for its generosity more than a century ago is drafting three bills aimed at holding the Ivy League school accountable.\nThe Legislature gave Dartmouth cash and land in the 1800s with the provision that any resulting income be used to educate poor New Hampshire students.\nRep. Renny Cushing asked Dartmouth about the donations in July. Unsatisfied with the answers, he is preparing three bills: one requiring Dartmouth to file a report on the income generated by the land, another requiring state approval to sell the land, and a third aimed at improving collaboration between the state and the college.\nThe college isn't commenting on the legislation but says it is confident it has honored its commitments.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
