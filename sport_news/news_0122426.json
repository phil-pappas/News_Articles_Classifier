We’ve played a lot of tough matches this year and they’re making us better. We want to continue to play our best.” \nThe Golden Bears (13-7) won a close first game. After opening a 13-8 lead, Gibsonburg was able to fend off any SJCC (6-12) rally by consistently holding at least a four-point lead before taking the game on a kill by Chloe Morelock, who finished with eight kills and two blocks. \n“We came out hitting strong and hustling,” Gibsonburg coach Traci Jones said. “We weren’t sure what to expect from St. Joseph but I think we did the best we could do. With all of our hitters, it gives us a lot of versatility. If one girl is down, the others pick it up.” \nThe second game was, for the most part, all Gibsonburg. After opening the game with six straight points, the Golden Bears continued to use consistent serving and huge hitting for a 10-2 lead, leading St. Joe coach Rachel Griffith to call timeout. The timeout served its purpose as the Crimson Streaks put points together to draw within 12-8 but just as quickly as the momentum came, it went. Gibsonburg rattled off 13 of the next 14 points to take the game. Exquisite serving by Emma Jones and Lindsay Weickert aided the run. \n“They have great servers,” Griffith said of the Golden Bears. “We struggled with our serve receive too and we’ve got to get that first pass to the setter in a better fashion.” \nIt appeared as though Gibsonburg was going to run SJCC right off the court, as the Golden Bears opened a 15-4 lead in the third game. St. Joe didn’t fold, even after trailing 22-12 later. The Crimson Streaks won six of the next seven points and got within 24-20 but a big hit by Courtney Kolkemeyer (nine kills, six blocks) led to a St. Joe error to end the match. \n“We have to get better before tournament,” Jones said. “We have to have our hitters going and our serve receive better. We have to have better passing to our target.” \nMakenzie Reiter led St. Joe with six kills while Adrienne Wehring and Katie Harrison each had four kills. SJCC just couldn’t figure out the best way to defend the strong hitters from Gibsonburg for most of the night. \n“It’s difficult,” Griffith said. “Our middle blockers are trying to get a piece of it but the offense of Gibsonburg is the fastest we’ve seen all year. We will work on our serve receive and get better and get ready for tournament next week.” \nLindsey Wieckert tallied 11 kills and five digs while Taylor Wieckert had 13 digs and six kills. Setter Ashley Hasselbach finished with 34 assists and three kills while Jones had four kills and three blocks. 16 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1RDGfb4 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:48:36.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
