During the seminar, ministers, experts and senior police officers deliberated on infrastructure, regulation and safety aspects of traffic. The seminar was divided into three segments, infrastructure, regulation and safety. Experts presented their opinion and answered questions from the audience, which included university students, academicians and members of the civil society. All three sessions of the seminar were moderated by Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) SM Sahai, who is also the Director of ISLA and the brain behind the seminar. Sahai highlighted ISLA’s role and said it conducted studies on various issues related to policing and undertook activities related to the development of youth and students. The ADGP said ISLA was registered with the state government in 2008 and its membership was limited to senior functionaries of the government and eminent civil society members, having expertise in various issues with a bearing on public life. He said the suggestions put forth by the speakers would serve as a guideline to formulate a new traffic strategy in the state. Director General of Police K Rajendra Kumar, who is the president of ISLA, said the police were trying to engage all stakeholders and said the expertise and opinion shared by the panelists would help in visualising a better traffic scenario. The seminar was inaugurated by Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti. She spoke about the need for better traffic management and an end to the VIP culture. Mehbooba said traffic mismanagement was not only about infrastructure and regulations, but also about responsibility. She stressed the need for developing infrastructure and managing the existing traffic scenario by employing technological advancements. State cabinet ministers Haseeb Drabu, Abdul Gani Kohli and Imran Ansari also spoke during the seminar. Drabu said the vendors were part of the traffic ecosystem and had to be taken care of in any revised strategy. The first business session of the seminar discussed the existing infrastructure and the need for its upgrade. The second business session of the seminar on safety talked about measures to secure the roads. The third business session on regulation discussed the measures taken to streamline the traffic. Inspector General of Police, Crime, Muneer Khan and former Director, Tourism, M Ashraf spoke in detail about the existing and possible regulation measures. “The need is to control the road user behaviour,” said Khan, former head of the police’s Traffic Department. Minister for Roads and Building Syed Altaf Bukhari said the government would include the recommendations of the seminar in its new master plan, which was being drafted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:04:37.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
