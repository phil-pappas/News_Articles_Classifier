It's a key question for investors, and analysts hope for an answer when Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) reports Q3 earnings after the close Tuesday. \nYahoo stock touched a two-year low of 27.20 on Sept. 28 but has since risen and closed Friday at 33.37, down a fraction. Shares are down 34% this year. \nYahoo stock rose 4.3% Thursday after the company launched a new, high-security email service that lets users go password-free for both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones and Android mobile devices, which run on the operating system developed by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) subsidiary Google.

Instead, the service sends a message to the smartphone connected to the account, where the users can then tap yes or no to sign in. \nThat step removes the possibility that hackers can correctly guess a password, making the new option more secure, according to Yahoo. The feature is now available in the Mail app and will be available on other apps later this year, the company said. \nAlibaba Down \nSince Yahoo announced plan to spin off its Alibaba stake, Alibaba stock has fallen 31%, hurt by instability in China's stock market and China's slowing economic growth. \nThat means the value of the spinoff deal — value of Yahoo's holdings — has fallen to about $27.5 billion from $40 billion. Yahoo total market value is about $31.4 billion, so the tax issue is big for the company and its shareholders. \nIn late September, the IRS declined to rule on whether the spinoff would be tax free. \n\"The IRS is working to amend the rules on taxing spinoffs (and) we think Yahoo may be able to complete the transaction before the new rules come into effect,\" wrote SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Peck in an industry note on Sept. 29. \"While precedents could support a tax-free treatment, the possibility of an IRS audit could create uncertainty on the final tax bill. \n\"We believe investors likely are pricing in the most pessimistic scenario, fully taxing the Alibaba shares and giving almost no value to Yahoo's core business .\" \nIn a research note Friday, Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi said investors should expect Yahoo shares to be volatile and \"remain tied to Alibaba Group's performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:34:00.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
