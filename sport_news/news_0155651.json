A workshop on the same is scheduled to take place next Wednesday.\n\"I am happy that five new teams have come up. The matches will be played across 10 venues which is again in line with AIFF's mission to make the league pan-India. The best part is the home and away format which gives opportunity to build fanbase,\" I-League CEO Sunando Dhar told TOI on Thursday.
