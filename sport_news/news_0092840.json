Quince would get a dedicated right-turn lane, and the existing right-turn lane on Pacific Avenue would grow to better accommodate trucks' wide turns. Both lane expansions would also add bike lanes.\nCurrently, the intersection has dedicated left- and right-turn lanes on the south and west sides.\nOther aspects of the project include bringing sidewalks and ramps up to code in accordance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Crews also plan to build a raised median on the east side of the intersection to stop westbound drivers on Pacific Avenue from making left turns into driveways.\nThe areas in purple in the above map represent the lane expansion project planned for the Forest Grove intersection of Pacific Avenue (Oregon 8) and Quince Street (Oregon 47).
