It was the first game in Jets' history that Burchfield was not the starting QB. \nBurchfield has completed 55 percent of his passes for 1,072 yards, nine touchdowns and three interceptions this season, according to the team's Hudl page.\"Not sure,\" James Clemens coach Wade Waldrop said when asked if Burchfield is out of the season. \"We'll see what happens and how well he can recover. He had it worked on and we'll see how it goes from there.\" So blessed to of been able to play this game for so long and give my all to JC.

We expected him to. Had a couple of communication things that we've got to get a little bit better that hurt us on a couple of drives in the first half. He made a couple of big throws late and had good command of the offense. He had no turnovers, which was huge in your first start.\" \nHighlights from Burchfield's 271-yard performance vs. Mountain Brook \nDaniel Boyette covers Huntsville region high school sports for The Alabama Media Group and The Huntsville Times.
