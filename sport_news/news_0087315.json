Junior fullback Caleb Draper ran for 117 yards and three touchdowns on 28 carries Friday night against Paris. \nBack to pass . Bearcat quarterback Hayden Fennell threw the football 31 times Friday night against Paris. He completed 19 passes for 165 yards. \nSophomore carry . Halfback Grant Rodatz looks for running room against Paris Friday night. \nBy Glenn M. Parrish \nDemocrat Editor \nBooneville ran 93 offensive plays and scored 21 points. Paris ran just 33 plays and scored 28 points to ruin the Bearcat homecoming Friday night. \nIt is the first homecoming game loss since 2006 and only the second since 1972. \nThe Bearcats (1-6, 0-4 Conference 3A-4) kept the ball for more than five minutes to start the game but came away empty handed. \nThree straight first downs moved the ball from their own 27-yard line to the Paris 35 but an illegal shift put the Bearcats behind the changes and four downs later an incomplete pass by quarterback Hayden Fennell gave Paris the ball at their 31. \nFennell would throw the ball, a lot. Fennell put the ball in the air 31 times for the Bearcats, likely a record, and completed 19 of them for 165 yards. He would also be the target of a pass on the final play of the half and run for 102 yards. \nParis’ first possession saw Devin Davis and Ethan O’Bar stop Nate Davidson for a yard loss on a third-and-3 and the Eagles punted. \nStarting from their 38 the Bearcats moved to the Eagle 9 but on a second and inches a false start backed up the Bearcats. After the quarterback Caleb Draper got 9 yards on fourth-and-2, Draper scored from the 1 on the next play and the Bearcats led 7-0. \nDraper had a big night himself. He scored three touchdowns with 28 carries for 117 yards. \nThe Bearcat defense forced a second Eagle punt but an 8-yard loss on a fumble on the ensuing possession forced a Jeff Dobbs punt of their own. \nDavidson returned the punt 13 yards to the Bearcat 43 and carried for a touchdown on the next play to tie the game with 9:22 left in the first half. \nDavidson would be the biggest difference in the game, carrying for 201 yards on 13 carries and logging a reception for 27 yards – accounting for 228 of Paris’ 294 total yards. \nAnother Dobbs punt preceded a Paris (4-3, 3-1) scoring drive that took three plays. Davidson got the first 25 yards and Preston Drewry hit Kris Graham for 24 yards and a touchdown to give the Eagles’ the lead. Graham also added the extra point as he did after each of the Paris scores. \nParis got the ball back at its 42 by intercepting Fennell and, after a holding penalty, on a second-and-16, Davidson went 66 yards to make it 21-7 with 4:28 left in the half. \nThe Bearcats kept the ball the rest of the half, reaching the Eagle 9 with a minute left before a sack and a completion for no gain left 0:02. A trick play saw Brady Brasher try to hit Fennell in the end zone on the final play of the half. \nParis fumbled twice on the initial second half possession, but got both back – the Eagles put the ball on the ground six times and got four back. \nFennell returned a punt 9 yards and the Bearcats went 66 yards in 10 plays. Draper converted one third down and Fennell another before Draper scored from the 5 with 6:23 to play in the quarter, cutting Paris’ lead to 21-14. \nAgain Paris answered in a hurry and again it was Davidson doing the damage, this time on a 52-yard carry to make it 28-14 with 6:06 left in the third quarter. \nHayden Fennell converted a fake punt with 8 on fourth-and-8 then added a 30-yard run to get the ball to the Eagle 21. \nFennell hit Taiton Mitchell for 6 on a third down from the 16 and Draper scored on third-and-goal from the 1 to make it 28-21 with 1:40 left in the third quarter. \nComing off a six catch game, Mitchell had seven catches for 60 yards, tying for the second most receptions in a game. Brasher had six catches for 58 yards. \nAfter the kickoff Davidson carried for 13, 4 and 27 yards on the next possession, but the fumbled on the final play of the third quarter and Brian Smith recovered for the Bearcats at the Booneville 20. \nThe Bearcats crossed midfield before an intentional grounding penalty and an errant fourth down snap was recovered by the Eagles. \nParis got 9 yards on the next play but Dobbs threw Graham for a loss on second down and a third down fumble brought up a fourth-and-2. \nStarting from the 31 with 7:13 left the Bearcats converted another fourth down and used Fennell’s arm to move to the Paris 49 before a fourth down incomplete pass ended the drive. \nSmith’s second fumble recovery would give the Bearcats the ball back at their 22 with 1:36 to play. \nFour Fennell completions covered 45 yards before a sack, an illegal substitution and Fennell’s second interception gave the Eagles the ball with only 37 seconds to play. \nThe Bearcats will be looking to end a four game losing streak when they travel to Mansfield this Friday. Kickoff is at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:18:57.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
