Even without its top running back because of an injury, Cal rushed for 280 yards in a 45-44 victory.\n\"We have to get the defense fixed, and we have to get it fixed right away,\" Strong said, turning serious.\nEven for a defensive-minded coach like Strong, it might not be easy.\nWith Saturday's game against Oklahoma State, Texas is now entering Big 12 play where offense rules. Baylor, Texas Tech and TCU are ranked among the five offenses in the Football Bowl Subdivision, with Oklahoma and West Virginia in the Top 20.\nTexas may be resigned to manufacturing a few stops and counting on the offense do its job - which is what happened during a frantic fourth-quarter comeback against Cal.\n\"We wanted to show that we can still fight,\" Heard said. \"In a lot of the games in the Big 12 are going to be like a fourth quarter shootout until the whistle blows.\"\nAfter breaking Vince Young's school record for total offense with 527 yards\nin just his second start, Heard is starting to be discovered.\nHe got a congratulatory text from Young, a boyhood idol who now works for the university. After five seasons in the quarterback wilderness, Texas fans are hoping that Heard may have actually solidified the position once played by Young and Colt McCoy.\n\"The amazing performance by Jerrod was just unbelievable,\" Strong said. \"You see the loss and you don't want that to be overshadowed.\"\nStill, Heard is not exactly a campus celebrity just yet.\n\"Some people know me, some people don't and some people confuse me for Isaiah,\" Heard said, in a reference to basketball point guard Isaiah Taylor.\nEven defensive players acknowledged Heard's play served as a rallying point.\n\"When he started to make the plays, now it was out turn,\" linebacker Peter Jinkens said.\nThat might be the best hope for the Texas defense, which is dealing with the twin growing pains of youth and inexperience.\nSenior Desmond Jackson wasn't buying excuses.\n\"Are they playing Big 12 football? Are they playing Division I football?\" Jackson said. \"At the end of the day, you signed a scholarship to be a Division I football player, so you got to play like it. It doesn't matter what age you are.\"\nTexas coaches and players maintain the mistakes are fixable if they can avoid major breakdowns. Of Cal's 280 yards rushing, 194 came on five plays, including runs of 74 and 49 yards.\nBut the Longhorns responded, holding Cal to just 21 yards in the fourth quarter, including two yards rushing. The huge holes in the interior line were corrected for a quarter.\n\"We realized what type of defense we can be,\" defensive tackle Poona Ford said. \"They didn't score in the fourth quarter. We realized that we can make that happen throughout the game.\n\"If we didn't have those mistakes, they wo uldn't have run for that much yardage.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-22T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:11:17.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
