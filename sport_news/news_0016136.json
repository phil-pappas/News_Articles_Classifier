The Dukes play perhaps their biggest game of the season so far when they face host Downers Grove North on Oct. 16. By JASON ROSSI - jrossi@shawmedia.com \nELMHURST – A road game against Proviso West was a big game for York’s football team. Related Links High school football: York ready to rebound in quest for playoff spot \nNow the Dukes are on to the next challenge. \nYork, which needs wins in its final three regular-season games to keep its playoff hopes alive, started the stretch with a 43-10 win against Proviso West on Oct. 9. \nNow comes a showdown against a Downers Grove North team that also is fighting for its playoff hopes. \n“Obviously it’s going to be a big game, and our kids know that,” York coach Matt Monken said. “Downers Grove North beat Downers Grove South [on Oct. 9], so they’re coming off a big win and we’re both fighting for our playoff lives, so we know it’s going to be a big game.” \nAlthough the magnitude of the game can’t be ignored, the Dukes aren’t approaching this one any differently than their previous seven games. The intensity might be a little different, but the process of preparing is the same. \n“We’re still on the same weekly plan, but you can tell the coaches and the players understand the importance and challenges of this game,” Monken said. “We’re still working to get better and doing the right things on both sides of the ball, but the kids are definitely excited. \n“Week 8 of the season you’re usually a little banged up, but those injuries start to not feel as bad before a game like this.” \nYork should be as close to full strength as possible. Quarterback Johnny DiCanio was limited in a game against Oak Park-River Forest on Oct. 2 but helped engineer two extended scoring drives in the first half against Proviso West despite the Panthers playing tough defense against the Dukes’ option attack. \nRunning back Lucas Alexander flashed his arm with two pass completions on halfback passes, Matt Reicker hauled in a touchdown catch, and the offensive line opened some big holes in the ground game. \nA constant all season for the Dukes has been tough defense, and that was the case against the Panthers with Monken mentioning the performances of Sean Ward and Jack Julian. \n“A lot of guys stepped up for us and made things happen for us,” Monken said. “Our kids played well. They knew how important it was to get some momentum going their way. \n“This is a big game for us, for a couple teams in our conference. We’re definitely excited.” \n– \nWho: York at Downers Grove North \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Oct. 16 \nWhere: 4436 Main St., Downers Grove \nRecords: York 3-4 (1-3 WSS), DGN 3-4 (0-4 WSS) \nOutlook: Neither team has a shot at the West Suburban Silver title, but this might be the biggest game yet for both the Dukes and the Trojans as the winner stays alive for a postseason berth with the other is officially eliminated from playoff contention.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:38:51.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
