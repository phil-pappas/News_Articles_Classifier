By Troy Hyde Newton Daily News \nANKENY — Colfax-Mingo junior Dakota Hostetter and Lynnville-Sully senior Canyon Kuhlmann will each get a chance to better last year’s performance at the state cross country meet in 2015. \nFor the third time in her career, Hostetter will run in Fort Dodge following her third-place finish in the Class 1A state qualifier girls’ 5K at Des Moines Area Community College, while Kuhlmann heads back to state for the second straight year after finishing his 5K in the 15th and final qualifying position. \nHostetter, who is ranked eighth, was defeated by two ranked runners from No. 1 Pekin, but her time of 20 minutes, 5 seconds was easily enough to send her to next weekend’s Iowa High School Cross Country Championships in Fort Dodge. \nKuhlmann had a tougher time in the boys’ 5K, but he’ll head back to state after finishing in the final qualifying spot four seconds ahead of 16th-place finisher Peyton Walker of Eddyville-Blakesburg-Fremont. \nThe Lynnville-Sully girls finished in fifth with 152 points. They were nine points back of the third and final qualifying spot, which was nabbed by Colo-NESCO. \nNo. 1 Pekin won the meet with 24 points, and fifth-ranked Mason City Newman Catholic was the runner-up with 54 points. Van Buren edged Lynnville-Sully by a point in fourth. Colfax-Mingo came in seventh with 171. \nThe Hawk girls were led by junior Ida Byggeth in 17th, two spots off the 15th and final qualifying spot. Byggeth crossed the line in 21:50.8 and the final state qualifier finished 10 seconds faster. \nSenior Marissa Vos was one spot and 26 seconds behind Byggeth in 18th, while senior Kasiah Ehresman finished 31st in 23:32.9. Sophomore Hailey Scandridge was 48th and junior Haley James crossed in 52nd. The non-counting finishers were junior Kristine Jaennette in 72nd and senior Shelby Foster in 74th. \nPekin’s Gwynne Wright, who is ranked No. 2 in Class 1A, won the race in 19:07. Her teammate, ninth-ranked Shea Dahlstrom, was the runner-up in 19:54.6. \nHostetter was the only returning runner from last year’s Colfax-Mingo squad that advanced to state. She finished 22nd last year. Hostetter’s younger sister, freshman Ilia Hostetter, was the next Tigerhawk to cross the line as she was 33rd with a time of 23:41.7 in her first regional meet. \nFreshman Colleen Craig was 36th with a time of 23:47.4 and freshman Payton Rhone was 47th in 24:24 Colfax-Mingo freshman Kylie Wellington was 70th. \n“The kids really brought it tonight,” Colfax-Mingo coach Zach Tomas said. “It’s awesome to think we don’t graduate anyone.” \nKuhlmann was 51st at last year’s 1A boys state meet but he’ll look to improve on that after finishing 20 seconds faster at Thursday’s state qualifier at DMACC. \nLynnville-Sully was 19th in the 21-team field with 434 points. Kyle Kramer was 82nd, Lucas Jones crossed in 106th, Jared Bassett hit the line in 123rd and the final counting runner was Caleb Jansen in 127th. \nColfax-Mingo was 17th overall with 412 points. The Tigerhawks’ top finisher was junior Cameron Warner, who finished 43rd with a time of 18:53.5. \nFreshman Cauy Furgison was 70th, while freshman Jordan Lescaleet ended up 97th, freshman Mike Martinez crossed in 108th and freshman Nic Duffy hit the line in 112th. Junior Will Dunsbergen placed 125th and sophomore Jacob Frier was 142nd. \n“Again, the boys are very young,” Tomas said. “We had four freshmen in our top five and two of them joined the team after school year started.” \nUnranked Andrew Stumbo of Ogden won the boys 5K race in 16:23.7. No. 11 Ryan Millikin of Pekin was the runner-up in 16:49. \nThird-ranked Pekin won the meet with 67 points, while No. 8 South Hamilton was the runner-up with 74 points. The final state qualifying team was Ogden with 109 points. \nThe Class 1A state meet takes place at Fort Dodge’s Lakeside Municipal Golf Course. Dakota Hostetter and the 1A girls will run at 2 p.m., while Kuhlmann and the 1A boys begin their race at 2:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:29:34.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
