I'm 30 years old and I want to play five or six more years, and during this time I want to do well and try to maintain my level from recent seasons,\" Ronaldo told Spanish daily Marca upon receiving his award.\n\"Real Madrid should always win trophies and this year is no exception. I'm always gunning for more,\" he added.\nLionel Messi's absence has been keenly felt by Barcelona since the Argentine went down with knee ligament damage at the end of September.\nWith Messi out until mid-November, Luis Suarez and Neymar have the arduous task of trying to help Barca overcome the loss of the four-time Ballon d'Or winner but it hasn't been plain sailing for the Catalans, who are aiming to bounce back from a 2-1 defeat at Sevilla when they take on Rayo Vallecano at home on Saturday.\n\"Nobody can replace Leo, and nobody should think they have to take on his role. Neymar, Sandro, Munir and myself, we all have to keep playing our role in attack,\" Luis Suarez told the La Liga website.\n\"Obviously, we feel the absence of the best player in the world, but we all have to chip in to help the team just like we've been doing these past few matches,\" added the Uruguayan.\nThe game of the weekend in Spain pits table-topping Villarreal against third-placed Celta Vigo on Sunday.\nBoth sides will want to restore their early-season fortunes after laboring into the international break -- Villarreal lost their unbeaten start at previously winless Levante while Celta's momentum has been somewhat stalled by two straight draws.\n\"It will be a difficult game against a direct rival. We want to pick up the three points because winning after the break is very important,\" defender Eric Bailly told Villarreal's club website.\n\"We've started very well and we must continue in this way,\" he added.\nAtletico, who are three points off the pace in fifth, visit Real Sociedad, Valencia are at home to Malaga, while Sevilla will bid to continue their recovery with a third straight win when they go to Eibar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:20:04.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
