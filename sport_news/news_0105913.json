They had a lot of the same guys on defense.\"\n\"Kind of\" is an understatement.\nCSU had 185 yards of total offense in that game. Bibbs was limited to 54 yards. Grayson threw for 147 yards. That led well-traveled CSU head coach Jim McElwain to label it \"about as bad a performance offensively as I've ever been associated with.\"\nAggies standout linebacker Nick Vigil was a freshman on that 2013 team and saw considerable playing time. Senior defensive lineman Jordan Nielson also anchors the defense that was the league's best statistically a year ago.\n\"Vigil is a great player,\" CSU coach Mike Bobo said. \"He runs hard, he hits hard, he gets them lined up on defense.\"\nAdvertisement Bobo added, \"It's going to be a tough challenge. When you turn on the film, they are very, very good defensively. They're sound, they're very multiple at what they do...We have to realize not everything is going to work. We have to reserve the right to punt at times, and the main think is don't turn a bad play into a catastrophe if they've got us. But if we have an opportunity to make some plays, we have to make them.\"\nCSU did that last season at home, when Grayson hit Rashard Higgins with a 46-yard pass in the final minute and Jared Roberts made a 46-yard field goal as time expired to give the Rams a 16-13 win.\nUtah State comes in at 1-2 after beating Southern Utah, then falling to the Pac-12's Utah and Washington. CSU is 2-2, with the two losses also coming to power-five programs — Minnesota and Colorado — in overtime. The Rams got back to .500 last week, beating Texas-San Antonio 33-31 on the road.\n\"We're definitely ready as a team,\" Stevens said. \"We've had some good performances from offense, defense and special teams. We've all kind of taken our turns playing really well. I think it's definitely good that we're coming off an emotional win down in Texas.\"\nStevens has rebounded since being benched late in the third quarter against Minnesota.\n\"I feel like I've progressively gotten better week to week,\" he said. \"I think week two I kind of had a setback and did a pretty good job of coming back in week three and four. I think my confidence has grown in this team and this offense and I think that I have a lot of confidence on the O-line and the receivers and running backs. They've done a great job these last four weeks.\"\nUtah State, which by the end of the game was down to its third quarterback last season in Fort Collins, again will be without starter Chuckie Keeton, who sustained a knee injury against Washington. Sophomore Kent Myers has taken over for coach Matt Wells. Wells succeeded Gary Andersen, who left for Wisconsin ... before moving on to Oregon State after two seasons in Madison.\n\"The things that Kent Myers brings to the table is some athleticism, he brings some confidence based on his play last year, how he feels about himself and how his teammates feel about him,\" Wells said this week. \"His teammates are very, very confident in him. I can tell you that. He brings athleticism and he throws the ball well whether it's down the field, in the pocket or on the move. He's improved from last year, but game time will tell. I like where he's at, and our guys are very confident in him.\"\nBobo said of the Aggies: \"You turn on the tape and see a team that is physical, that is fast. And, that is coached very well. I think a great sign of that is last year, when they had the injuries at quarterback ... to go on and win 10 games is extremely impressive.\"\nThis is the first of a crucial three-game league stretch for the Rams, who have Boise State and Air Force — which dealt them their league losses in 2014 — at home the next two weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:45:19.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
