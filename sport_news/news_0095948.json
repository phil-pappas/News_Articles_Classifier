Game 4's win was punctuated by a five-RBI night from Mets first baseman Lucas Duda and another home run by Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy, his sixth in as many games. Murphy, who only hit 14 home runs during the regular season, grabbed the series MVP award. \"I really can't explain it,\" he said after the game when asked the secret to his success. \"It's just, it's just a complete blessing. That's the only way I can describe it. I'm excited to be able to do something to help us win ball games, but I can't explain it.\"Mets manager Terry Collins said he was in awe of Murphy's performance during the playoffs.\"There's times when players, who are good players, once in a while they get a chance to show the world how good they really are. And this series, so far in post-season, Daniel Murphy's done that,\" Collins said.The Mets last appeared in the World Series in 2000, when they lost to the New York Yankees in five games.They will now face either the Kansas City Royals or the Toronto Blue Jays. The Royals lead the American League Championship Series 3-2. Game 6 in that series is scheduled for Friday. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
