The investigation into Wednesday’s incident, including full toxicology test results, was expected to take at least a month. \nColeman was booked into King County Jail early Thursday and initially denied bail. Bellevue police officers said they arrested him because he left the scene of the two-car accident Wednesday evening. \nSteve Hayne, one of Coleman’s lawyers, has said Coleman was “in shock” and didn’t flee or go far from the scene. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:22:18.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
