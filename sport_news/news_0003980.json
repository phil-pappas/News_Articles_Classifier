More \nThe NFL star called Coke \"poison for kids,\" and mocked the idea that Tony the Tiger's breakfast treat \"actually is a food\" during an interview on Boston sports radio earlier this week. But both companies have hit back at the Patriots quarterback. \nDuring the Monday interview, Brady was asked about Alex Guerrero, a friend, nutrition coach and business partner of Brady's. Guerrero was the subject of a recent Boston Magazine article that describes him as a \"glorified snake-oil salesman,\" for making questionable claims about the nutritional products he sells. Brady defended Guerrero and launched an attack on major food and beverage companies for the products they sell. \nHe said that while most people think it's OK to drink Coke, \"I totally disagree with that and when people do that I think that's quackery.\" \nBrady served as a paid spokesman for Glaceau Smartwater, which is owned by Coca-Cola, from 2007 to 2010. \nA Coke spokesperson responded by saying, \"All of our beverages are safe and can be enjoyed as part of a balanced lifestyle.\" The company said it offers many low? and no?calorie drinks, along with smaller portion sizes of its regular drinks. \nLater in the same interview Brady took a swipe at one of Kellogg's best-known products, Frosted Flakes, questioning whether it's real food. \nNot surprisingly, Kellogg's said Frosted Flakes is actually a food. Its spokesperson responded, \"Cereal is a delicious and nutritious breakfast. Numerous studies show that a cereal breakfast is associated with lower [body mass index, a measure of obesity] in both children and adults.\" It said a bowl of Frosted Flakes with skim milk has only 150 calories. \nFinally, Brady was questioned about whether he lectured teammates who might come into the locker room with \"a big bag of McDonald's burgers.\" He said he'd only talk to them if they asked his opinion. But then added, \"We get brainwashed to believe that all these things are just normal food groups. That this is what you should eat....I like to try to avoid those things.\" \nMcDonald's, which is one of the NFL's sponsors, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Coke competitor Pepsi, which is also a major NFL sponsor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:40:59.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
