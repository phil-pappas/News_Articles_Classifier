We’re giving you 72 extra hours to enter our Holiday Cookie Contest. That's right, we're extending the contest entry deadline.\nSubmissions will be accepted until Oct. 28, at 11:59 p.m. Mailed entries must be received by Oct. 28. Voting opens Oct. 29 at 12:01 a.m., and ends Nov. 8 at 11:59 p.m.\nAs before, we're looking for a cookie recipe that you have created, along with an essay about what makes it special. Unique cookies, those with a twist — maybe you've added an unusual ingredient to a traditional or family favorite, or maybe you've invented an out-of-the-ordinary treat.\nReaders will help choose the winning recipes by voting for their favorites. Recipes of the top 15 vote-getters will be tested by baking students at Kendall College, in a partnership with the Chicago Tribune. A panel of Tribune food writers and culinary professionals will taste those cookies and choose the winners.\nAnd prizes? They are bound to entice you to pull out the baking sheets:\nFirst place: $250 cash, plus a Baking & Pastry Boot Camp at Kendall College (value $375). The multiday hands-on class, led by Kendall faculty pastry chefs, will teach the fundamentals and basic techniques of pastry, including layered, sponge and rolled cakes, tortes, genoise, mousses, bavarians, buttercreams, pies, tart shells, cream puffs and more. The winning recipe also will be featured for sale at the Kendall College cafe, The Daily Grind, throughout December, with proceeds going to a scholarship for the School of Culinary Arts/Baking Pastry at Kendall.\nSecond place: $150 cash\nThird place: $50 cash\nPlus, all 15 finalists will receive a copy of the Chicago Tribune “Holiday Cookies” cookbook.\nSubmit entries online at chicagotribune.com/cookies or via mail to Holiday Cookie Contest, Chicago Tribune, 435 N. Michigan Ave., Room 500, Chicago, IL 60611-4041.
