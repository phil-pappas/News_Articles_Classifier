Instead of coasting toward my feet, the snook turned east, flipped its tail and chafed through the leader. (That’s a professional way of saying I broke it off.) \nBut it got me to thinking after a lifetime of fishing from boats, this land-based fishing thing might be kind of fun. Growing up, I stalked lunker black bass on the golf course ponds at Patrick Air Force Base and chased tarpon, redfish and snook around culverts after heavy downpours. But the whole beach thing (sans boat) is kind of new to me. \nI needed some help. But whom does one turn to for sage advice on such matters? \nThat’s an easy one. The Land Captain. He wrote the book on shore-based angling. \nI’ve known Steve Kantner since the early ’90s when we helped found the world’s first magazine focusing on saltwater fly fishing. The first time I ever fished with him, we were driving around industrial areas in North Miami in his Jeep looking at the GPS in very much the same manner as one tries to find a wreck with a GPS and bottom sounder. Our targets? Exotic invasive species like the Asian grass carp, giant snakehead and pacu. Kanter made his bones fishing the legendary South Florida piers like Anglin’s and the Juno Pier. He’s fished as far north as Playalinda and the stretch between Canaveral and Fort Pierce is one of his favorites. So what’s his first piece of advice for taking advantage of the mullet run on foot? \n“People need to remember that the mullet run isn’t just about mullet,” Kantner said. “There are also tons of small whiting and croakers as well as traditional baitfish like scaled sardines, glass minnows and herring. If you know what’s there, you’ll be able to tell what’s eating them.” \nSo, the question turned to snook. I’ve been throwing various swimming plugs, but thanks to Kantner, I have a new strategy. \nAlthough swimming plugs work, Kantner is a big believer in the generic bucktail. \n“Like I said, it’s not just all about mullet,” Kantner repeated. “You’ve got all these other small, broad-bodied baitfish like the croakers and whiting and pilchards. Nothing covers that type of spread like a feathered bucktail. \n“One of my favorites for snook and redfish is a leadhead jig like a red-tailed hawk,” he said. “These days, most of them are made using nylon, but my favorites actually use feathers… the bigger and fluffier and nastier, the better.” \nKantner believes the longer schlappen plumes (there’s a fly tying term for you) impart the most realistic action mimicking a baitfish, especially if tied so that the feathers splay outward. \nBut now that you’ve got the secret weapon, how do you fish it? \n“Most of these fish — snook, redfish, ladyfish and bluefish — feed in the surf,” Kantner said. “But they don’t feed in and out. They feed along the surf. So, when you see people casting perpendicular, you’re missing out on 90 percent of the fish.” \nI can see where Kantner is coming from. So many times when fishing the beach, you see people casting out. Standing there up to the tops of my calves in the swash with snook busting around my ankles, it dawned on me: cast parallel to the shoreline and you’ll get in front of exponentially more fish. \n“Regardless of what type of lure or bait, you want to make casts quartering the beach and parallel to the predominant wave direction,” Kantner said. “And the direction of the longshore current makes a big difference.” \nKantner prefers long casts into the current, bringing the bucktail or plug back toward you with a slow, steady retrieve. \n“Just fast enough to keep the jig off the bottom but slow enough that it gets down in the water column,” Kantner said. “Anything from 1 1 / 2 - to 2 1 / 2 ounces. If it doesn’t have a red tail tied into it, you can add a red plastic worm like a Mr. Wiffle or bass worm. \nHis favorite times to fish are high tide, when baitfish and are pushed up toward the crest of the dune, especially during low-light hours. \n“Sunrise and sunset, in conjunction with a high tide really are the peak periods,” Kantner said. \nBut he also has one more piece of advice. \n“Whatever you do, don’t point the rodtip at the fish when trying to surf it up on the beach,” Kantner said. “Especially with braided line. When the rod straightens out and there’s no give — that’s when fish break off.” \nTed Lund is a freelance writer born and raised on the Space Coast. He operates the outdoor blog tedlund.com.

The book can be found online at Amazon, as well as in Barnes and Noble, Bass Pro Shops and other specialty retailers. The cost is $29.99. Like my colleague at the Sun Sentinel in Fort Laudersale said, even if you own a boat, you’ll catch more fish after reading this book.
