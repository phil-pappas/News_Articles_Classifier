The results remain as unpredictable as Beane implied.\n“There’s two separate things here, right?” said Dodgers GM Farhan Zaidi, who was motivated to take his MIT education and doctorate in behavioral economics from Cal into baseball after reading “Moneyball” and spent 10 years working for Beane. “One is – can you predict what is going to happen? And the answer to that is no. A lot of people are going to make predictions about who is going to win and how it’s going to unfold. But very few people are going to nail it. So in that sense, it is (a crapshoot).\n“But I think the important thing is that doesn’t detract from the team that goes all the way and ends up winning. It’s still an incredible accomplishment. ... But the ball still has to bounce your way. Baseball is a game that’s played over a 162-game season and suddenly you’re playing five- and seven-game series against teams that are very closely matched.”\nAll the more reason to look for every advantage possible. With a front office at the forefront of baseball’s analytical revolution, the Dodgers have devoted a great deal of brainpower to doing exactly that. The results, even Zaidi acknowledges, move the needle only a small degree in one direction or the other at this time of year.\n“If the question is what kind of advantage can you create for yourself? Even that is very narrow,” Zaidi said on the eve of the Dodgers’ National League Division Series against the New York Mets. “Advancing in the playoffs has gotten way more sophisticated both statistically and with the number of scouts that are out watching these teams. But even then, maybe you go from 51-49 (in your favor) to 52-48 if you absolutely nail it.”\nOne fairly reliable predictor of postseason success, Zaidi said, is “having strong, high-end pitching” either in the starting rotation or the bullpen.\nIt doesn’t get higher than the Dodgers’ combination of Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke. Between them, they led the majors in ERA and WHIP (Greinke), innings and strikeouts (Kershaw) and a host of the more sophisticated analytics that “Moneyball” has spawned.\nKershaw finished the season with a 2.13 ERA and 0.88 WHIP. Greinke had the lowest ERA in 20 years (1.66) and an 0.84 WHIP. It is the first time two starting pitchers on the same team had ERAs below 2.25 and WHIPs below 1.00 since the legendary combination of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale did it for the Dodgers in 1964. Before that, it hadn’t happened since 1917.\nThose ’64 Dodgers didn’t make the World Series (didn’t even finish with a winning record). And so far, the Dodgers’ attempts to ride Kershaw and Greinke to a World Series have come up short.\nWith Greinke almost certain to exercise an opt-out clause in his contract and become a free agent – with no guarantee the Dodgers re-sign him – this could be their last best chance to ride the tandem to a championship.\n“I think it’s definitely a lottery,” Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis said of the vagaries of post-season success. “But I think some teams go in with more pingpong balls than other teams. I think our team has a lot of pingpong balls.\n“You’re going to get, for all intents and purposes, four starts out of these guys in the NLDS. Four starts in the NLCS. Four starts out of them in the World Series. So you’re looking at 12 starts out of a potential 19 games with two of the top five pitchers in our sport. I think that’s definitely in our favor.”\nThe closest comparison in the wild-card era might be the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, who rode Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson to a World Series title. Those two started 10 of the Diamondbacks’ 17 post-season games (Johnson also pitched in relief in Game 7 of the World Series), combining to throw almost 100 innings with a 1.19 ERA. The Diamondbacks won eight of the 10 games one (or both) of those two pitched – and lost four of the seven games when they didn’t.\nJimmy Rollins and Chase Utley went to consecutive World Series with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2008 and 2009 – but fell short when they tried to load the front of their rotation with Roy Halladay and Cole Hamels.\n“The ERA leader and the strikeout leader – I was thinking about that – on the same staff. That’s pretty darn good,” Rollins said of the Dodgers’ duo. “They still have to be hot. They have to do what they’ve done in the regular season.\n“And the postseason finds a way to change guys. I’ve seen it. I’ve witnessed it. I’ve been a part of it. Some seem to get even better. Some seem to go the other direction. But we’ve had a lot of rehearsals around here. Now it’s time to go out and complete the play.”\nContact the writer: bplunkett@ocregister.com\nRelated: Kershaw says his playoff past doesn't trouble him Smith: Mets vs. Dodgers is more reunion than rivalry Broadcaster Vin Scully to miss Dodgers postseason, expected to return in 2016 Time has mellowed Mets manager Terry Collins Dodgers-Mets: How they match up", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/kershaw-686749-game-don.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/scully-686699-dodgers-vin.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dodgers-686759-mets-leader.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/collins-686770-time-dodgers.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dodgers-686755-mets-new.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:49.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
