Steve Crowder specializes in lower St. Johns River marine fishing and reports that in spite of high tides and abundant freshwater from rain, some excellent angling is available. \nThat’s especially so for heavyweight croakers, which he believes will turn on in a big way next week with spawning “Virginia” fish of 2 to 3 pounds available in big numbers. \nThis is fast-action fishing, excellent for neophyte anglers and family-style outings. Dead shrimp on the bottom is the ticket, and fishermen can fill a cooler fast with these excellent-eating, good-fighting marine panfish. \nCrowder advises fishing during fast-moving tides, and concentrate on deep river areas having rocky, undulating bottom. Concentrate fishing effort during mid-tide, hard-running phases, as slow tides make for poor action. \nHe recommends the St. Johns between the mouths of Trout River and Sisters Creek. The industrial docks and areas of this portion of river are good, and will also produce sea trout, mangrove snapper, flounder and bull redfish on drop-off ledges, according to Crowder. FRESHWATER \nHigh water in the lower St. Johns River has made for excellent bream and channel catfish action from Welaka to the Shands Bridge (Florida 16), according to Rick Hamilton of R&J Tackle Shop in Green Cove Springs. Bream are taking earthworm and cricket baits in creeks and along undeveloped areas of the St. Johns, in places where water has pushed up into newly flooded areas of brush and shoreline debris. \nCatfish can be caught in similar places where bream are feeding, but creek mouths are especially good, for anglers using cut minnow baits, live shiners, earthworms and dead shrimp. Deep points and bars also are holding catfish, which are weighing 5 to 10 pounds. \nLargemouth bass fishing has been good in the river, too, with much of the best action found in deeper areas of drop-offs, submerged points, and sandbars. Fish are falling to Carolina rigs with soft plastic lures and crankbaits. \nMullet fishermen are catching limit numbers (50 fish per person, per day) at the northeast corner of the Shands Bridge. Mullet are huge, with plenty of 2- and 3-pounders caught, and state wildlife officers are checking anglers for over-the-limit catches. \nBryn Rawlins of Highland Park Fish Camp on the St. Johns south of Astor reports limit numbers (5 per person, per day) largemouth bass to 7 pounds are taking plastic worms at the northeast corner of Lake Woodruff, a widening of the St. Johns River. Crappie fishing also improving steadily on Woodruff in open water of the west shore for anglers drifting and trolling with jig-and-minnow combinations. \nCrescent Lake, south of Astor, also has been giving up open-water crappies, as well as Lake Lochloosa near Gainesville. SALTWATER \nVeteran Capt. John Eggers reports that in spite of very high water, slot redfish are hitting in the Intracoastal Waterway south of the St. Johns River during low and early incoming tides. Anglers should target shallow mud flats that usually are too low to fish during low water. Trout are hitting in Intracoastal feeder creeks during falling tides, but flounder action is poor. Live finger mullet on a jig head are best. \nCapt. Leon Dana reports the Intracoastal near Palm Valley is beginning to clear, which improving trout, redfish and flounder action for anglers using natural baits at creek mouths and deep holes during the last of falling tides. Some black drum and sheepshead also are beginning to show in the Intracoastal. \nMandarin’s Alan Green worked Simpson Creek near Fort George Inlet from a kayak recently to boat a slot redfish and lots of undersize trout, using jigs tipped with live shrimp. \nFernandina Beach’s Shawn and Laura Thompson tapped a flood tide recently to catch slot and oversize redfish near Sawpit Creek and Black Hammock Island using live finger mullet and Berkley GULP swim baits. \nOn Monday, Jacksonville’s Capt. Dave Sipler led Jacksonville’s Brandt family to a banner day of redfishing in the Arlington and Mill Cove areas of the lower St. Johns. He reports reds were crashing baitfish on the surface, with diving birds diving into the melee — all in 20 feet of water. They caught 25 redfish. The river was so fresh in that area they also caught a 4-pound channel catfish. \nJacksonville’s Paul Gallup Jr. says plenty of bull redfish are taking cut mullet baits in 35 to 40 feet of water along the channel drop-offs of the St. Johns from Blount Island to the river mouth. He needed 12-ounce sinkers to hold bottom in running tide to get huge reds, all of which must be released by state law. \nFly rod specialist Capt. Rich Santos is still catching tailing redfish during the two hours before high tide in the Fort George area. Kayaks afford the best redfish access. Big jacks still are available to anglers working St. Augustine Inlet. \nMandarin bass angler Tim Mann has been chasing marine fish, and has been catching lots of surface-crashing jack crevalle in the Nassau River and Nassau Sound. Diving birds lead to that action. \nCapt. Tony Bozzella has been leading anglers to schools of small redfish and trout, with a few flounder mixed in, in the back-country waters of Hannah Mills and nearby tidewater creeks off the north side of the St. Johns River east of Jacksonville. Some trout have weighed to 4 pounds, with fish coming on diving minnow plugs and TBS Jigs tipped with fresh shrimp. \nSheepshead in the 2- to 3-pound range are in good supply throughout much of the lower St. Johns River, from the Little Jetties to the river mouth, with channel markers, pilings and rock pilings offering good action. \nSurf Capt. Noel Kuhn reports lots of mullet are in area beach waters, with bluefish, jacks, trout and large blacktip sharks to over 6 feet offering good action. HUNTING \nFlorida’s first-phase dove season runs through Oct. 26. \nNorth Florida’s archery deer season continues through Oct. 18. \nIn Georgia, the open bow deer season runs through Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:47:46.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
