Staff photo by Adam Carrington slideshow MARIETTA — While football remains as popular as ever, particularly in the South, former Atlanta Falcons cornerback Bobby Butler said youth registration is on a decline. In an effort to promote youth football, Butler and former Falcons linebacker Buddy Curry helped organize a mothers’ safety clinic Tuesday night at Sprayberry High School on Tuesday night. Close to 300 mothers attended to better educate themselves on the safety of the sport.Butler and Curry have already done clinics at other high schools and have at least two more planned, but Curry said the Sprayberry clinic had the largest turnout so far. “Football is the greatest team sport on our planet,” said Butler, who played for the Falcons from 1981-92. “What can we do to save our game? What can I do to convince these moms that it’s OK to let your little boy try this sport? That’s what we’re here to do.”The first hour-and-a-half of the clinic consisted of a presentation covering the awareness of concussions, how to properly wear equipment and teaching heads-up tackling by using the shoulders.The final 30 minutes allowed the mothers to take the field and face off against tackling dummies in order to know the proper techniques for tackling without using the head as a weapon.“(Mothers) don’t want to just do drills. They want to be great at it,” said Curry, a former All-Pro who played for the Falcons from 1980-87. “They want to understand what it feels like to hit with the front part of their bodies instead of the front of their head. Moms are real serious about it. They want to do great at it.”“I’m definitely concerned with injury,” said Sherry Conley of Acworth, whose son, Josh, is a part of the Etowah junior program in Cherokee County. “Just want to make sure they have the proper equipment and the proper techniques. He’s on the line, so I want to see it from his angle and see what he does.”It was mentioned that while other sports are susceptible to concussions — skateboarding, cycling, basketball and soccer, among others — football is what most mothers fear the most. According to USA Football, concussions was caused by a blow to the head that causes to brain to shift in the skull. The biggest sign is when a player appears dazed or is confused about an assignment. Removing the player from the field and allowing them to rest is usually the best treatment. Curry said the NFL is taking safety measures on how to avoid serious blows to the head.“People are scared to let their kids participate in football because they think they’re all going to have brain injuries,” Curry said. “The NFL is like, ‘Who are the decision-makers?’ and the moms are usually the decision-makers on what sport their kids are going to play. (The NFL) want to get accurate information to moms.”During his playing days, Butler said he would have continued playing if he suffered a concussion. But with the effects a concussion can have on a player after their playing careers, he’s looking to “change that” by stressing that tackling is shoulder-to-shoulder contact.“In our terminology, we don’t even use the word ‘head,’” Butler said. “We talk about tackling with our shoulders like they did before we had facemasks. “Our generation, we knew that our helmet was a weapon. We’re paying for it now. We don’t want a great game that we love so much to be lost because parents don’t feel it’s safe to play.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:00:15.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
