Pleasant senior D’Jannay Patterson bumps the ball during Tuesday’s senior night game against Ft. Madison. The Panthers fell to 3-4 in conference with the loss, but can finish their conference schedule at .500 with a win next week at Keokuk. \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nThe Mt. Pleasant volleyball team celebrated senior night on Tuesday night with a game against conference rival Ft. Madison. The Panthers had a few big runs against the Bloodhounds, but in the end, could not win a set, falling 3-0 (25-13, 25-19, 25-15). \nThe first set saw some nice play out of a group of Mt. Pleasant seniors, who were all able to start together. The Panthers went back and forth with the Bloodhounds early and battled to a 9-9 tie to begin the game. \nFt. Madison, however, put its foot on the gas pedal and went on a 14-2 run to make it 23-13. The Panthers cut the lead to 23-15 with a defensive point and an ace by D’Jannay Patterson, but Ft. Madison closed it out with two more points to take the game, 25-13. \nThe second set was the closest of the night. Ft. Madison had a steady lead throughout, but the Panthers stayed within striking distance. \nThe Panthers went to Julie Lasswell for the attack attempts many times in the second set. She cut the Bloodhound lead to 23-18 with a spike late in the game, and Abbie Liechty killed one on the next serve to make it 23-19, but that’s as close as the Panthers would get. Ft. Madison once again scored the last two points to take the set 25-19. \nMt. Pleasant had an early 2-1 lead thanks to an Ashlee Menke ace, but Ft. Madison went on another big run, this time 16-2, to go ahead 17-4. Mt. Pleasant cut the lead to single digits and stayed within 10 thanks to a couple of serving streaks from Haylee Boecker and Sam Zeleny, but in the end, the Bloodhounds finished off the Panthers, 25-15. \nAfter the game, coach Dave Streeter said he thought the seniors played well together, and complimented the Ft. Madison hitters. He also said that the hitters on the Mt. Pleasant side were improving. \n“I like to see our hitters hitting the ball and going up and attacking with some force,” Streeter said. “Good things happen when you hit the ball.” \nThe Panthers fell to 11-20 overall and 3-4 in the conference with the loss. Mt. Pleasant has the shot to finish with .500 record in the SEC in their final road game against Keokuk on Thursday, Oct. 22. \nMt. Pleasant will be back at home on Monday, Oct. 26, against Keokuk in the first round of regionals. A win would give them a rematch with Ft. Madison on the road in the regional semifinals on Thursday, Oct. 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:42:51.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
