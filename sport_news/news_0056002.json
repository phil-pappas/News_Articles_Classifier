Apparently from the top down judging by what veteran pitcher Jon Lester recalls about his free-agency interview a year ago with Cubs' president of baseball operations Theo Epstein:\n\"I think the biggest thing that sold me ... was just how arrogant (Epstein) was about it, and I mean that in a good way.\"\nNo wonder that after a recent relief appearance, veteran reliever Fernando Rodney assumed a Usain Bolt pose on the way to the dugout. No wonder Cubs' sluggers don't mind staring at their mammoth home runs from the batter's box and emerging from the dugout for curtain calls. No wonder this team celebrates like another T-shirt message, \"Party like it's 1908.\"\nThese guys really do like to show off.\nNo, the Cubs didn't gather in August or September to tape a \"World Series Shuffle\" video. Maybe they just weren't asked.\nThe Bears backed up the \"Super Bowl Shuffle\" by winning a championship, of course, and maybe the Cubs didn't want that pressure.\nRegardless, the Cubs do seem to have a different vibe about them than past Cubs' teams had.\nMaddon has instilled a fearless ferocity in them. Ever since taking the job last November, he has preached to not let the pressure exceed the pleasure.\nMuch of the Cubs' success has been attributed to their young players, who play like they're back playing sandlot ball.\nBack in April, veteran catcher Miguel Montero hatched the Twitter hashtag \"wearegood,\" which led to the boast on T-shirts, which evolved into a state of mind.\nPrevious Cubs' teams sometimes seemed embarrassed to be good, as if it's what other teams are supposed to be.\nThese Cubs' players first convinced themselves that they are good and then went about the business of convincing others.\nNow the Cubs are trying to prove it all over again against the formidable Mets.\n\"I really belive strongly in our players,\" Maddon said, \"and that we'll be able to rebound from this.\"\nIf the Cubs do so, maybe they'll tape the \"World Series Shuffle\" before facing the American League champions.\nmimrem@dailyherald.com\n Columnists Sports MLB Cubs Imrem, Mike Baseball Pro Sports Newsletter Pro Men", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-19T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:54:16.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
