Enemkpali was suspended for a punch that broke the jaw of New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith during a locker room altercation in August.\nThe Bills, who claimed Enemkpali on waivers, were granted a one-week roster exemption and had until Monday to activate or cut the player.\nWood was placed on injured reserve after he was hurt in Buffalo's 14-13 win at Tennessee on Sunday.\nStarting running back LeSean McCoy (hamstring) is out indefinitely. Backup Karlos Williams (concussion) has a chance to return Sunday, when Buffalo (3-2) plays host to Cincinnati (5-0).\nJets: Defensive end Sheldon Richardson has returned to practice after serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy.\nCardinals: A person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press that the Arizona Cardinals have signed outside linebacker Dwight Freeney to a one-year contract. The move comes after the Cardinals' top outside pass rusher, Alex Okafor , went down with a calf injury in Sunday's 42-17 victory at Detroit. The 35-year-old Freeney, a seven-time Pro Bowl player, has 1111/2 career sacks and led the NFL with 16 sacks in 2004.\nChiefs: Kansas City anticipates Jamaal Charles will miss the remainder of the season after the star running back hurt his right knee in the third quarter of Sunday's loss to Chicago. Chiefs coach Andy Reid said Monday that results of an MRI on Charles were not yet available, but \"the worst case is the ACL is torn. That's probably the direction it's heading.\"\nColts: Quarterback Andrew Luck returned to full participation for Monday's practice for the first time in two weeks. He is still day-to-day with a sore right shoulder and had been limited in practice since leading Indianapolis to a 35-33 win at Tennessee on Sept. 27. The Colts (3-2) play host to defending Super Bowl champion New England (4-0) on Sunday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:19:53.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
