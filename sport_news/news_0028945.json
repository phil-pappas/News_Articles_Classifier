The new mayor's promised 90-day audit of the previous administration's financial deeds and misdeeds raked over for all to see and with that audit nothing, still no clear recommendation to or for the Mayor and the Jacksonville City Council will do about the biggest elephant in the room- the unfunded liability called Police and Fire Pension fund.\nThe Florida Times-Union, the only daily newspaper in Jacksonville, Duval County, home of the (can't win) Jaguars, has taken to running a weekly account in both news form and somewhat original reporting of the misdeeds of the now-former Pension Fund Director John Keane in an attempt to inform the public and the elected officials of how shameful it should look that this guy with no college education should be running a $300 million dollar plus fund with a salary rivaling the President of the United States.\nBut back to the Mayor's promised 90 day audit. We must first remember that the Mayor is an accountant by profession. And though a political promise has been fulfilled, though not officially released, it is done. This audit means nothing other than to confirm previous political rhetoric: the previous administration was incompetent, blah, blah, blah.\nBut where is the beef? The public at large is keenly aware of the basic issue with the Pension Fund: The Jacksonville City Council accompanied by previous Mayors for the past 20 years have refused to pay in the share required of the city to the Police and Fire Pension Fund for the benefit of its First Responders in their retirement.\nAll of the stories and innuendo concerning Keane's retirement plans and former salary are not within the City Council or the Mayor's purview to do anything about. This act of smoke and mirrors does nothing to recommend and carry out a method for funding the Pension shortfall fulfilling a contract made 30 years ago with its employees. But Democrats were in charge then. They were supported by the public unions wholeheartedly back then. Now, 30 years later, the Republicans are in charge. Having worked strategically in the legislature nationally and on the state level to dismantle public union influence, any story that contains union leader misdeeds can be taken to mean...what? That the contract should not be fulfilled? That the contract needs to be rewritten? What?\nUnder the previous administration, even with its incompetent public relations and inability to navigate the internal relations with the city council, at least it reached an agreement with the Police and Firemen's Unions through its Pension Fund. And although the funding source identified, was not the popular of options available, it was a solid option with an unending source of revenue. The JEA agreement to fund the Pension Fund in exchange for the City taking in their pension accounts is the best option available. But it won't even get a mention in the new City Council and this Mayor certainly can't present any option that originated in the last administration.\nSo where does the Pension Fund elephant stand? The Mayor must propose a tax increase in one form or another to pay the city's share of the retirement fund for the city's First Responders.\nRepublicans cannot, by their very nature, propose such a thing. The 90 days audit expresses again what is already known; Jacksonville, Duval County, is one of the lowest taxed counties in the State, which is in one of the lowest taxed states in the Union. The result: any and every thing dependent upon State and local governments will suffer financially from lack of resources and personnel. The Pension Fund will not get funded under this administration unless a tax increase is agreed to by the Council, proposed by the Mayor, and you guessed it, voted on by the taxpayers. Look for a referendum. Put on the shelf until after the election, there is now enough time to put it in front of the voters get it voted down and say: \"Well, we tried.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:47:42.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
