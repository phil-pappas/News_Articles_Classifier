The city of Lexington has been preparing itself for this week since it was first announced as the host last summer, and the time is here to show the world it can handle the event. \nAttendance is expected to be just shy of 50,000 people per day, which will set a Keeneland record. When those 50,000 people aren’t at the track, they will be participating in several events around town, ranging from bourbon tastings and concerts to film screenings and private dinners. Plenty of fun to be had by all. \nLet’s just hope traffic isn’t a disaster. \n\nWe will hear from Mark Stoops at noon. \nStoops will host his weekly press conference luncheon a little later today in Commonwealth Stadium. He’ll reflect back on Saturday’s loss in Starkville and look ahead to the upcoming task in Lexington against Tennessee. \nCheck back for a live stream of Stoops’ comments with a full rundown soon to follow. \nTennessee is favored by a touchdown. \nThe spread for the Cats’ next game is seven points in favor of the Vols.

Tune in this morning to hear all about his trip and his thoughts on Kentucky’s loss to Mississippi State. By Bryan the Intern on © October 26th, 2015 @ 8:00am UK Athletics \nThe breakdown of the offensive production in various situations against Mississippi State, as well as the combined season statistics through 7 games in each of those situations: \n1ST DOWN Run: 16 rushes for 92 yards (5.8 ypc) Pass: 14-24, 148 yards, 1 INT \nCombined Season Statistics Run: 104 rushes for 543 yards (5.2 ypc), 3 TD Pass: 68-103, 747 yards, 5 TD, 3 INT, 6 sacks for -45 yards \nRECAP: Honestly, the Cats were pretty good on 1st down all night. The 2nd and 3rd quarters saw the passing game hit a wall but UK was consistently able to get big chunks in the running game and hit some nice passes too. \n2ND DOWN AND LONG (6 yards or more) Run: 4 rushes for 3 yards (0.8 ypc) Pass: 8-13, 43 yards, 2 INT, 1 sack for -6 yards \nCombined Season Statistics Run: 51 rushes for 259 yards (5.1 ypc), 1 TD Pass: 32-59, 363 yards, 2 INT, 3 sacks for -22 yards \nRECAP: Ugly, ugly, ugly. Cats had no ability to get anything going in 2nd and long. Despite running 18 plays on 2nd and long, they only converted 1 into a first down. Pathetically bad. \n2ND DOWN AND SHORT (5 yards or less) Run: 6 rushes for 28 yards (4.7 ypc), 1 TD Pass: 3-4, 8 yards \nRun: 30 rushes for 105 yards (3.5 ypc), 6 TD Pass: 13-18, 84 yards, 1 INT \nRECAP: Much like 2nd and long, not much production here. Towles QB sneak for a touchdown is included here and a couple other decent runs, but overall just an inability to move forward. \n3RD DOWN AND LONG (6 yards or more) Run: 3 rushes for 23 yards (7.7 ypc) (converted 1 of 3) Pass: 4-7, 57 yards (converted 4 of 7) \nCombined Season Statistics Run: 11 rushes for 134 yards (12.2 ypc), 1 TD (converted 7 of 11) Pass: 30-51, 458 yards, 2 TD, 2 INT, 6 sacks for -43 yards (converted 21 of 57) \nRECAP: UK actually saw some good success on these tough downs. To convert half of your 3rd downs in a long scenario is pretty darn good. Kinda surprising in the 1st half to see the Cats try and run it for a 1st down on 3 different occasions, but it worked once. \n3RD DOWN AND SHORT (5 yards or less) Run: 3 rushes for 23 yards (7.7 ypc) (converted 2 of 3) Pass: 1-3, 4 yards (converted 1 of 3) \nCombined Season Statistics Run: 19 rushes for 73 yards (3.8 ypc) (converted 11 of 19) Pass: 5-14, 71 yards, 3 sacks for -25 yards (converted 5 of 17) \nRECAP: The 2 rushing conversions came late in the game when the result was not in doubt. Again, and this has been a theme all season, UK can’t get the tough yards on 3rd and short. The passing game has been pathetic all year and to only convert 11 of 19 in 3rd and short with the run shows a complete lack of execution and struggle on the offensive line. The Pros and Cons and more Cons from last night’s game By Drew Franklin on © October 25th, 2015 @ 11:00pm \nAfter a very long and unproductive day of napping on the couch, it’s time to write some words about last night’s debacle. Join me for the pros and the cons of Kentucky’s third loss of the season… \nPros \nLet’s try to find some positives. It won’t be easy. \n— Austin MacGinnis is money. Kentucky’s kicker went 3-for-4 on the night and his one miss was from 48 yards. If not for a UK timeout to avoid a delay of game penalty, MacGinnis would’ve been a perfect 4-for-4 on the evening, with that 48-yarder splitting the uprights before it was negated. He drilled his first attempt at the 48-yard bomb after Mark Stoops called a timeout; a timeout that led to a chewing of the officials’ asses on the sideline. Hashtag Angry Stoops. \n— The young guys got some playing time. We saw the debut of Drew Barker , some carries by Sihiem King and an all-freshmen secondary late in the game. It was big to get those guys on the field for some experience against a good team like Mississippi State, and their snaps, though limited, will go a long way toward their development. \nI’m a huge fan of King. Really liked what he showed us with his three carries for 31 yards. \n— Chris Westry picked off Dak Prescott. A lot of the talk leading up to the game was about Prescott’s almost 300 pass attempts without an interception. That streak came to a close last night when Kentucky’s Westry got up and took one away from the Bulldogs for his second career interception, both coming on the road in big games. We’ve only seen Westry for half of a season, but he’s already being talked about as a player who can be great, not just good, in Kentucky blue. Potentially one of the best to ever play corner at UK with what he’s shown us in his young career. \n— Boom Williams is really good. \n— We almost had a football game going into the half. Then, Mississippi State scored two touchdowns in a minute and it was over. But there was some hope at one time, early in the game. \n— C.J. Conrad got involved. Fans begging to see more of the freshman tight end were given just that last night. Conrad caught six passes for 56 yards, UK’s second best numbers in both categories. Hope to see more of him in the future. He can really bust up defenses. \n— The team’s attitude seems positive moving forward. Mark Stoops said, “I’ve felt a heck of a lot worse than I do right now,” following the 26-point loss. “There’s not one bit of panic. That’s a good football team that beat us. We’ll go back to work, believe me.” \n— And the biggest pro of them all: We don’t have to go back to Starkville for another two years. I hope everyone who went last night survived. And learned their lesson. Cons \nOh, the cons. So many of them to list. Add the ones I don’t hit in the comments section. \n— Matt Elam did not fill Melvin Lewis’ shoes. No one expected Elam to be Lewis in his first career start, but the hope was he would play well. He did not play well, unfortunately. He did not do much of anything. Elam still has a long way to go before he’s ready to play in this league. Zero technique right now. \n— Dak Prescott had all day in the pocket. Kentucky did not put any pressure on State’s quarterback. He was able to sit back and pick the defense apart all night long. The knock on Prescott is he can’t throw, but even I could’ve thrown for 300 yards with that much time to pick out a target. \n— Starkville. \n— The end of the first half sucked the life out of Big Blue Nation. Touched on this up top, but it can’t be said enough: the game ended in the final minutes of the first half. A 10-7 Kentucky lead turned into a 28-10 deficit, with 14 of those points coming in the span of one minute. Ball game. \n— If there was any hope left in the second half, Ramsey Meyers’ personal foul demolished it. Kentucky had a first-and-goal from the three-yard line, down only two scores late in the third quarter. A touchdown would’ve made it a one possession game and the end zone was only one big push from the offensive line away. Then one of those offensive linemen, Ramsey Meyers, was flagged for a stupid, idiotic, inexcusable, what-the-hell-are-you-doing personal foul for swinging at a defenseless defender after the play. The penalty pushed the offense back to the 19-yard line and forced UK to settle for a field goal, rather than getting back in the game. \n— Dorian Baker dropped another pass. At least it wasn’t in the end zone this time. And he wasn’t the only one dropping balls. I believe four of Towles’ first five incompletions were dropped passes . \n— Have I mentioned how terrible Starkville is? \n— Kentucky had no shot with three turnovers . We knew the Cats would need to win the turnover battle to have any chance at victory. Mississippi State won that battle, 3-1, and Kentucky isn’t a good enough team to win on the road with three turnovers. \n— Jason Hatcher did not play. As is the case with Melvin Lewis, missing Jason Hatcher was detrimental to the defense and a big part of the problem with the nonexistent pass rush. \n— The line of scrimmage was lost on both sides of the ball. It wasn’t just the D-line getting manhandled by the Bulldogs, Kentucky’s offensive line was pushed around all night, too. Towles faced constant pressure as State’s back line of defense dropped back and waited. \n— Ramsey Meyers’ penalty was really, really bad. I can’t imagine what Mark Stoops had to say to him after the game. I bet he used several swear words. \n\nTennessee this week. Let’s put this behind us and get up for the Vols. Huge week ahead for the program and for the city of Lexington. \nGo Cats. The Palm Beach Post names Stoops a potential replacement for Miami By Andrew Cassady on © October 25th, 2015 @ 10:30pm \nAfter the Miami Hurricanes were embarrassed by Clemson 58 to nothing for the worst loss in school history it was apparent a change needed to be made. That change as Al Golden was relieved of his duties as head coach and another opening has come to the world of college football. As with the South Carolina opening the name Mark Stoops is being bandied about as a potential replacement for the vacancy. This time it’s coming from South Florida newspaper, The Palm Beach Post , and here’s what they had to say: \nMark Stoops, Kentucky coach: A promising 4-2 in Lexington (entering Saturday) after going 7-17 in his first two seasons. Stoops left a job as Florida State’s defensive coordinator, where he had been since 2009, to coach UK. Would the 48-year-old return to Coral Gables, where he was defensive backs coach under Larry Coker from 2001-03? A person close to Stoops said he still has property in the area and would likely consider the job if offered. One of the better South Florida recruiters on this list. Would UM, which pays Golden $2.54 million per year, pay him at least the $3.25 million he makes at Kentucky? \n[The Palm Beach Post: Seven possibilities for Miami Hurricanes after firing Al Golden ] \nSo this begs the question, is Miami an elite level program that Stoops would consider leaving for? The days of “The U” are long gone while Florida and FSU have dominated the state for the past decade. As Matt said on the radio earlier this month, if Miami came calling he could see it playing out like Charlie Strong and Tennessee. That is, a “Thanks, but no thanks”. Kentucky now has better facilities, a sleeping giant football fanbase, and, thanks to the SEC network, more resources to pay the man. Stoops’ personal ties and the recruiting base would be compelling but in the end I don’t think it is a program to worry about. \nHow about you? 22 Former Cats Tip-Off In The NBA This Week By Andrew Cassady on © October 25th, 2015 @ 9:30pm \nThe NBA returns this week which means we are almost to the sweet spot of the venn diagram when every sport that matters is going on at the same time. 22 former Cats will be in action this week on active rosters and many of them have a shot at lifting the Larry O’Brien trophy to end the season. Who are the contenders? Read on to find out: Championship Contenders: \nHouston Rockets-Terrence Jones Vs. Denver, October 28 \nThe Rockets made the 2015 Western conference championship before falling to the Warriors. The core of that team is back for another run at a championship. \nOklahoma City Thunder- Enes Kanter Vs. San Antonio, October 28 \nThe 2015 Thunder missed the playoffs after being destroyed by injury for the majority of the season. Now, Durant, Westbrook, and Enes are all back and healthy. They will be a major roadblock in the West. Playoff Hopefuls: \nNew Orleans Pelicans- Anthony Davis @Golden State, October 27 \nAD and the Pelicans grabbed the 8th seed a bit ahead of schedule. Can they make the playoffs again in a loaded Western conference? \nBoston Celtics- James Young Vs. Philly, October 28 \nCan James Young find his place on the main roster or will the young guard be playing on a new team by next season? Charlotte Hornets- Michael Kidd-Gilchrist @Miami, October 28 \nMKG is out the next six months after shoulder surgery. Can the Hornets remain in the hunt until then? \nToronto Raptors- Patrick Patterson Vs. Indy, October 28 \nFormer Cat Dwayne Casey will try to get the Raptors in the playoffs for the fourth straight season. Unfortunately the road to winning the East will run through Cleveland. \nWashington Wizards- John Wall @Orlando, October 28 \nThe Wizards have been on the brink of making a playoff run the past two seasons. Is this year finally the year? \nPhoenix Suns- Eric Bledsoe, Archie Goodwin, Brandon Knight, Devin Booker Vs. Dallas, October 28 \nAnd the Suns have been on the brink of just making the playoffs the past two seasons. Will Kentucky West finally get it done? Sacramento Kings- Rajon Rondo, DeMarcus Cousins, Willie Cauley Stein Vs. LA Clippers, October 28 \nThe Kings were on the playoff track last season before DMC got hurt and they fired their coach. Now, George Karl has a volatile roster and strenuous relationship with his GM. Win or lose, Sacramento should be one of the most entertaining teams in basketball next season. Utah Jazz- Trey Lyles @Detroit, October 28 \nCan they overcome losing Dante Exum for the year? Probably not, but this year’s version of the Jazz should still win a good amount of games. \nDetroit Pistons- Jodie Meeks @Atlanta, October 27 \nThe Pistons won’t be starting the season 5-23 this year. Rebuilders: \nMinnesota Timberwolves- Karl-Anthony Towns, Tayshaun Prince @LA Lakers, October 28 Philadelphia Sixers- Nerlens Noel @Boston, October 28 LA Lakers- Julius Randle Vs. Minnesota, October 28 \nThese former Cats are going to be in for a long season. Lucky for them that just increases their chances of adding Skal or Jamal Murray to their roster for next season. \nWhich former Cats will you be watching take the court this week?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:22:07.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
