Craig only went through the air five times, but made one of his three completions count with a 44-yard touchdown strike to Wendall Williams to take a 48-22 lead in the fourth quarter. \nWilliams was a human highlight reel for Cumberlands as that long touchdown was his only receptions and on his only carry of the game he took it 67 yards for six just before halftime. \nUPIKE struggled to find consistency at quarterback, leading to just 191 yards of offense through the air. Sani Warren started the game, but was removed just before halftime after throwing three interceptions and completing just 5-of-11 passes. R.J. Rosemond Jr., played the rest of the game, completing 9 of 16 for 117 yards with two scores and an interception of his own. \nRosemond Jr., picked up some tough yards on the ground as well, netting 51 yards on nine carries. Eddie Miller III led the receivers with 41 yards on two catches, including a 32-yard grab in the corner of the end zone to make it a 35-14 game early in the third quarter. \nWhile the Patriots ended up taking a 28-7 lead into halftime, it was a tight contest for nearly 27 minutes. Partly due to a combined four turnovers, neither team scored a point in the first quarter. Then in the early stages of the second, Weaver answered a UC rushing touchdown with a three-yard scamper of his own to make it 7-7. \nOver the next seven minutes the Bear offense stalled and Craig started to get things rolling, adding two touchdowns on the ground to give the Patriots a 21-7 lead. Following Warren’s third interception with 1:52 left until halftime, Williams broke free for his 67-yard score and the Bears never got any closer than 19 points the rest of the way. \nDown 41-14 late in the third quarter, UPIKE blocked an extra point and ran back the return for two points when Chad Conway lateralled over to Romon Morris to go the final 38 yards. On the ensuing drive, Weaver added a 30-yard touchdown and that would be as close as UPIKE would come to the Patriots at 41-22. \nWith the outcome all but decided, the Bears closed with their best drive of the game, going 73 yards on 13 plays for Rosemond Jr., to hit Anfernee Brown for six. With less than two minutes on the clock, an onside kick failed, and Cumberlands ran out the clock. \nJack Hopkins and Mark Hooper led the Bears’ defense in the loss with 10 tackles each, while Demetrius Taylor came up with eight and Arthur Williams made five stops. Conway and Derek Harris both recovered fumbles and Taylor and Terrell White both forced one. \nUp next for UPIKE is a meeting with Union at 1:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, Oct. 31. It is homecoming for the Bears and WYMT will be on hand to televise the action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:19:01.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
