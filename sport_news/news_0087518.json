Things got foggy thereafter but I do know he took my clothes off and put them in his washing machine. Somehow I ended up on the third floor in the bathroom as Cosby washed me,\" she said.\nJoe Marino/New York Daily News Donna Barrett (l.) holds an undated photo of her with comedian Bill Cosby during a press conference, Friday October 23rd 2015.

I thought he was wrong, but at that time I thought so was I,\" she said.\nDottye said Cosby called her the next day for phone sex, but she declined. When he invited her to a taping of \"The Cosby Show,\" she accepted for professional reasons but silently vowed she would keep a safe distance from the star, she said.\nThe visit turned into an informal apprenticeship on the show, and she even received a personalized jacket designed for cast and crew, she said.\nJoe Marino/New York Daily News attorney Gloria Allred (c.) at a press availability Friday October 23rd 2015, joined by two accusers of America's dad, Bill Cosby: Donna Barrett (l.) and \"Dottye\" ( pictured ) who declined to give her full name.

The complaints allege sexual battery or defamation.\nJeff Golden/WireImage Cosby, 78, has never been charged with anything by police, and almost all of the allegations against him are too old to criminally prosecute. Allred said Friday that she has more accusers poised to tell their stories too.\n\"This is not the end.
