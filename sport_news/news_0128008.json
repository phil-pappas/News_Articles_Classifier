His mother, Victoria, right, says she is still waiting for justice to be served, while the woman accused of the crime has not been formally charged.\nDejohni Orndorff, 34, of Belen was initially charged with homicide by vehicle, aggravated DWI and failure to yield in connection with the crash, which occurred Nov. 22, 2014. She was held at the Valencia County Detention Center on a $100,000 cash-only bond on those charges, and on a no-bond hold for previous charges, which include two felony counts of possession of a controlled substance.\nThe 13th Judicial District Attorney’s Office dismissed the charges in Magistrate Court in December 2014, saying it would pursue an indictment by a grand jury. That has yet to occur.\nVictoria Woolley says she’s worried that the case has been forgotten and is concerned that Orndorff won’t be charged in the death of her son.\n“Nearly a year later and nothing,” she said. “The response, or lack thereof, from the DA’s Office is unacceptable, and I feel so raped by the system.”\nDistrict Attorney Lemuel Martinez said his office is waiting on a second reconstruction of the crash by New Mexico State Police. But police say they’ve finished their investigation and it has been given to Martinez’s office.\nGrief upon grief\nOn Nov. 22, 2014, Victoria Woolley and her family were mourning the loss of her elderly mother who had passed away that morning. The family had gathered together to say goodbye and to start making funeral arrangements when Tanner needed to get away for a few minutes to be by himself. He took off on his motorcycle – something he had done every day of his life since he was a child – and headed to his Rio Communities home. A few minutes later, his brother, Tim, received that fateful phone call: Tanner had been involved in a terrible accident.\nWhen his family rushed to be by his side, Victoria knew he was gone, she knew he wouldn’t be coming back.\nWhat she didn’t know at the time was how long she would have to wait for justice.\nShe says she has received almost no information from Martinez’s office.\nMartinez says his office has been in contact with the family. He said he hopes to be able to present the case to the grand jury in the next month, but said it depends on when State Police complete its investigation.\n“We asked them for another reconstruction three or four months ago,” Martinez said. “They said they are in the process of doing it and that’s what’s holding it up. The second reconstruction is based on new information since the first reconstruction.”\nBut in early September, State Police Sgt. Elizabeth Armijo said the case was already turned over to the District Attorney’s Office and a grand jury is pending.\n“Our investigation into the case is complete and any questions regarding the prosecution of the case should be directed to the District Attorney’s Office,” Armijo said.\nScene of the crash\nPolice said Tanner Woolley was driving his black motorcycle east on Reinken Road when Orndorff, who was driving a Toyota SUV west on Reinken, attempted to make a left-hand turn onto Third Street and collided with the teenager.\nAccording to the criminal complaint, three witnesses reported that they were all driving east on Reinken when they saw Woolley, traveling in the same direction at high speed.\nOne witness said that, as the motorcyclist approached the intersection, the light was green for east- and westbound drivers.\nState Police officer Peter Andazola wrote in his report that when he reached the scene of the crash, Orndorff had “blood shot, watery eyes” and he detected “a slur in Ms. Orndorff’s speech pattern.”\nOrndorff told the officer that she did not see the motorcycle until the bike struck the right passenger side of her vehicle. She at first denied consuming any type of alcohol.\nAfter failing a field sobriety test, Orndorff refused to take a Breathalyzer test and was taken into custody.\n“Prior to placing the handcuffs on Ms. Orndorff, she asked if she told the truth (about) how much alcohol she had consumed would she still be going to jail,” the complaint said. “Ms. Orndorff admitted to drinking one beer earlier.”\nWhile Orndorff was in custody, she complained of injuries from the crash and told medical personnel she had ingested a bag of either heroin or methamphetamine. She was taken to Presbyterian Hospital for treatment and was medically cleared and booked into the Valencia County Detention Center.\nFamily in limbo\nIn the 10 months since her son’s death, Victoria Woolley said she still doesn’t know why Orndorff’s case is in limbo, saying she has no respect for the judicial system.\n“The District Attorney’s Office has dropped the ball in this case, and no one wants to own it,” Woolley said. “All I want to know is what’s happening. My son deserves justice, and I just want answers.”\nAs the one-year anniversary of Tanner’s death approaches, his family is planning a life celebration and barbecue at Anna Becker Park in Belen on Sunday, Nov. 22.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_05oct_woolley-400x301.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:59:24.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
