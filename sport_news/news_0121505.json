He threw for two touchdowns for the Chargers (2-4). His 43 completions were the most in NFL history in a loss; he needed one more, at least.\nRandall denied that as he lunged to poke away Rivers' short pass to Danny Woodhead near the front right pylon in the final seconds. Rivers was on his back after being knocked down, arched his neck up, then laid back down in frustration and flailed his arms.\nSan Diego lost to Pittsburgh on the last play on Monday night.\nThe fans inside Lambeau Field erupted with a collective sigh of relief. Green Bay (6-0) survived its biggest scare of the year to stay unbeaten.\nThe Packers started strong and finished barely in front. Running back James Starks had touchdowns on a 65-yard run and a 5-yard pass in the first quarter.\nThe Packers went up for good after Aaron Rodgers found James Jones for an 8-yard pass in the corner of the end zone for a 24-17 lead with 40 seconds left in the third quarter. The defense bent and allowed Josh Lambo's 32-yard field goal with 11:14 left.\nGreen Bay's stout pass rush finally caught up to Rivers in the second half. Datone Jones sacked Rivers on third-and-7 from the Packers 40 to end one drive. Until then, a Chargers line missing three starters held up well, with Rivers orchestrating a quick-strike offense and finding all the holes in the secondary.\nIt was the most porous outing of the year for the Packers' defense.\nBut the Packers came up with their most important stop at the end. Rivers was under pressure from linebacker Julius Peppers when he threw his final incompletion.\nFor the Packers, it was another relatively choppy outing for the offense.\nRodgers was 16 of 29 for 255 yards. At one point, Rodgers had as many completions as Keenan Allen had receptions midway through the fourth quarter.\nBut a hip injury kept Allen sidelined for much of the second half. He wound up with 14 receptions for 157 yards.\nStarks finished with 112 yards rushing on 10 carries. He started for Eddie Lacy, who had 3 yards on four attempts. Lacy, who sprained his right ankle earlier this season, played with his right foot heavily taped.\n__\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n From ", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/18/b4/bf/1ea6bfa5306541cea65bfbdb7aaca925\\u002Dbed6d39722f64b01a337798a4f9e8ad1\\u002D0.jpg", "http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/news/national/2-shark-attacks-near-hawaiis-oahu-island-same-day/nn5TP/", "http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/national/lindsay-lohan-wants-run-president/nn5PW/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/18/66/4f/1ea6bfa5306541cea65bfbdb7aaca925\\u002Dcd6691ea5036478b84c7d93bda919d5c\\u002D0.jpg", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/pro-refugee-politician-stabbed-neck/nn5TZ/", "http://www.wsoctv.com//news/news/national/former-tsa-officer-accused-allowing-marijuana-boar/nn5PZ/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/18/55/bf/1ea6bfa5306541cea65bfbdb7aaca925\\u002Dbed6d39722f64b01a337798a4f9e8ad1\\u002D3.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/18/c6/55/1ea6bfa5306541cea65bfbdb7aaca925\\u002Dcd6691ea5036478b84c7d93bda919d5c\\u002D6.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/18/c9/75/1ea6bfa5306541cea65bfbdb7aaca925\\u002Dbed6d39722f64b01a337798a4f9e8ad1\\u002D1.jpg", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://www.whio.com/news/news/national/justin-bieber-and-selena-gomez-release-new-song-to/nn5Ts/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:59:10.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
