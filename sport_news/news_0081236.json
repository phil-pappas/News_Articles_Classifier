But Aquinas' steady play quieted the masses throughout the match.\nAfter winning the first set, the Raiders built a comfortable cushion in the second and looked as if they might run away with the contest. But Cardinal Gibbons stormed back to even up the match.\n\"They definitely rallied,\" Zielinski said. \"That potential was always there.\"\nSo St. Thomas Aquinas shifted its play into high gear as junior outside hitter Allison Marble and senior OH Brook Bauer dominated the game.\nMarble finished with 16 kills, eight digs and two aces. Bauer had 15 kills, seven digs, one block and four service aces. Junior middle blocker Emma Dixon added seven kills, three blocks and three aces.\n\"I think they both really stepped up,\" Zielinski said of Marble and Bauer, noting Gibbons' strong defense.\nBut it wasn't enough to send the Raiders home with a loss.\nThe victory, Zielinski said, \"gives us confidence going into the postseason.\"\nSt. Thomas next travels to Chicago, where they'll take on Mother McAuley on Friday in the Asics Challenge tournament. Cardinal Gibbons hosts Pine Crest on Thursday.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560b4333/turbine/fl-st-thomas-aquinas-cardinal-gibbons-recap-0930-20150929"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:05:39.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
