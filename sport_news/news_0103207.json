Penn State players explained after a 29-7 win over Indiana \nSTATE COLLEGE â€” Bob Shoop began last Sunday's defensive meeting with a concept to counter Indiana's no-huddle offense. Penn State's defensive coordinator called it the \"no-huddle defense,\" and his players liked the idea. \nPenn State would approach the Hoosiers' hectic pace with one even faster. They wanted to be at the line of scrimmage before Indiana, play at a faster tempo and curb any advantage such a strategy provides. \nFollowing a 29-7 win, in which Penn State held Indiana's conference-leading offense to seven points, the players loved their new defense. \n\"We're the first team to be a no-huddle defense,\" safety Marcus Allen said. \"That's all I've got to say.\" \nIndiana arrived at Beaver Stadium with the Big Ten's top offense in points (36 per game) and yards (498.2) but without its starting quarterback or running back. Still, the Hoosiers ran their up-tempo offense behind backup quarterback Zander Diamont, who directed one good series. \nThe Penn State Nittany Lions line up against the Indiana Hoosiers on Saturday at Beaver Stadium in State College. \nDiamont led the Hoosiers on an eight-play, 65-yard scoring drive that tied the game 7-7 in the first quarter. After recovering an ensuing onside kick, Indiana had momentum on its side as well. But Penn State's defense outpaced the Hoosiers from there. \nAfter the onside kick, Penn State forced Indiana into a three-and-out, one of six such series in the game. The Hoosiers punted 11 times overall, nine after the touchdown drive. Penn State also forced a turnover on downs and a real turnover via freshman John Reid's interception in the fourth quarter. \nThe Lions credited their defensive tempo for making a difference. Penn State practiced at a high pace against the scout team last week. Even walkthroughs went at a high pace to keep players \"thinking fast,\" linebacker Jason Cabinda said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:29:55.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
