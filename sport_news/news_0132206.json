(Photo by David Banks/Getty Images) Staff Report \nMiddletown High School grad Kyle Schwarber set a Chicago Cubs record Tuesday night in the National League Championship Series. \nSchwarber, a 22-year-old rookie catcher/outfielder, cranked a solo shot off New York’s Jacob deGrom in the first inning of a 5-2 loss in Game 3 to become the Cubs all-time home run leader for a single postseason. The home run was Schwarber’s fifth of the playoffs. \nThe Mets lead the series 3-0. \n“I’m not really looking at that right now,” Schwarber told mlb.com. “I’m focused on winning ballgames, plain and simple. There’s no ‘I’ here. This is a team, plain and simple. I’m focused on making sure we play hard and get a win [Wednesday].” \nSchwarber was a first-round draft pick of the Cubs in 2014. \nGame 4 is at 8 p.m. Wednesday.
