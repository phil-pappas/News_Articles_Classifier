Four of the SouthCoast teams will be part of the playoffs, which begin locally with South Sectional quarterfinals Friday night at 7 p.m. Defending Division 3 state champ and second-seeded Dartmouth (5-2) begins its title defense at home against seventh-seeded Sharon (3-4) from the Hockomock League in the Southeast segment of the division. This is an all-Eastern Mass. Division with Southeast and Southwest sections and Northeast and Northwest divisions with the South and North champions playing in the Super Bowl Dec. 5 at Gillette Stadium. The path for eighth-seeded Apponequet (4-3) in Division 4 begins with a big roadblock at top-seeded Holliston (7-0). In Division 5, third-seeded Bishop Stang (6-1) is home to sixth-seeded Ashland (5-2) of the Tri Valley League and fifth-seeded GNB Voc-Tech (5-2) is at fourth-seeded Abington (6-1) of the South Shore League. Dartmouth coach Rick White hopes his Indians can repeat last year’s path to the championship, coming in with an identical 5-2 record, but with a predominantly new team. Last year, Dartmouth lost to Bridgewater-Raynham and Apponequet, but beat Melrose, 14-7, in the Super Bowl. This year the losses were to B-R and Middleboro. “It’s similar to last year so, hopefully, we can repeat last year’s pattern,” White said. “There are so many new faces on the team, but we’re playing well on defense and the offense is starting to put more points on board. “Sharon plays in a difficult league and their kids will be excited to play, so we can’t take anybody lightly. There are no second chances.” Zane Fyfe, in his first year as head coach at Apponequet, has the task of beating undefeated Holliston, the defending Division 4 Super Bowl champion, who won with a 43-0 victory over Wahconah Regional. “I don’t think there’s anybody beside the people at Apponequet who think we can beat Holliston,” Fyfe said. “Our kids are pretty excited. There are not a lot of returning starters, but we still managed to put together a pretty good run at end of season. We found what they’re good at and comfortable in doing and tailored to doing that the past 3-4 weeks and it’s taken off for us. “They’re a big team, well coached, aggressive and very disciplined. They play fast and we’re going to have to be on top of our game to beat them. All that doesn’t matter, because football is the greatest sport and anybody can beat anyone if they execute correctly.” This is the third straight year that GNB Voc-Tech is tournament-bound and the Bears face the defending Super Bowl champion in Abington, a 36-6 winner over Northbridge in last year’s game. “This is our third year in and we grabbed a win last year (vs. Ashland),” coach Chuck Allaire explained. “We know what to expect and we should go down there and play well. They’re fast on defense, but we match up size-wise. “We’ll take what they give us. We have some speed in the backfield and we’re pretty resilient. This team is pretty special. We have some glaring weaknesses, but we’ve found ways to win. That talks pretty highly about our kids.” Bishop Stang coach Ryan Sylvia lost starting quarterback Will Landry to an injury just about the time that projected starter Matt Golden returned from his pre-season injury. “It’s a weird feeling,” Sylvia said. “Will Landry got us to 5-1 and he gets hurt in the Coyle game. We were fortunate that Matt was healthy for that game, but I feel badly for Will. He played well and his injury will probably keep him out the rest of the year.” Senior running back Andrew Camacho came back from his early season injury last week against Bishop Feehan.
