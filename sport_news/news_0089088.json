Bogdanovic also said the coaches want improved defense.\nThe biggest question right now, however, is how much Bogdanovic's body will let him do early in the season.\nHe was back at practice Tuesday after sitting out a week with what the team called a \"sore right ankle.\" Bogdanovic said Tuesday that it's a lingering issue; he sprained the same ankle in August while playing for Croatia during the EuroBasket tournament.\n\"That was a long time ago, but I didn't stop at that time,\" Bogdanovic said. \"I continued to play, and now I have a little problem with it.\"\nBogdanovic took last week off because the ankle, which bothered him through training camp at Duke, did not improve after the preseason opener Oct. 4.\n\"It was getting worse and worse, so I decided to get off the court,\" Bogdanovic said. \"And now I'm back again.\"\nBogdanovic said he's not at full strength. But he returned because the week off helped, and he didn't want to fall too far behind his teammates.\n\"I want to stay in shape and to be on the practice floor,\" Bogdanovic said. \"Especially because we are trying to build our offense and defense, so it's important for me to be on the court. I feel a little pain, but it's not enough.\"\nTonight's preseason game against the Celtics at Barclays Center could provide the first good look of what this Nets team might look like this year, though it's unclear if Bogdanovic will play. Bogdanovic, Andrea Bargnani (tight hamstring), Thomas Robinson (sprained wrist) and Willie Reed (quad strain) practiced fully Tuesday, after each missed practice last week.\nNets coach Lionel Hollins wouldn't commit to them being on the floor today — that's up to the medical staff.\n\"Everything is day to day with this group,\" Hollins said.\nBut there's a good chance the Nets will be closer to full strength. Only Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (sprained ankle) and Markel Brown (strained oblique) missed practice Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:16:49.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
