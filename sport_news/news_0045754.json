Being No. 2 means you have to try harder. Being No. 3?\n“I like it because I can sit back and watch and judge and send my sarcastic tweets out and I don’t have to deal with all the hoopla that comes with being two of the best pitchers in the game,” said Dodgers lefty Brett Anderson, who gets the Game 3 NLDS start against the Mets and Matt Harvey on Monday at Citi Field.\nThe importance of Anderson (10-9, 3.69 ERA, 116 strikeouts in 180 ¹/₃ innings) for L.A.’s series survival was magnified when Jacob deGrom forged a Game 1 masterpiece for the Mets. After nine innings, it was obvious Anderson would be pitching for the Dodgers to avoid a 1-2 deficit, after Saturday’s 5-2 Dodgers Game 2 victory.\nAnderson has been on a playoff hot spot before. In the 2012 ALDS with Oakland, the A’s trailed the Tigers, 0-2. Anderson stepped up, outdueled Anibal Sanchez with six scoreless innings and Oakland survived — at least until Game 5. In 2013, against Detroit again, he pitched a disastrous one-third inning of relief, allowing one run and two inherited runners to score.\n“The first outing I had was the first home [playoff] game for Oakland in like 10 years so it was exciting,” Anderson said.\nThis time, he will be doing it in New York City, where he is 0-2 lifetime — both defeats against the Yankees (he never has faced the Mets). The groundball specialist was better on the road this year: 7-4 with a 3.07 ERA away from Dodger Stadium; 3-5 with a 4.29 ERA at home.\nAnderson, though, has a different reason for being pumped about facing Harvey in Queens.\n“Selfishly, I’m excited because it’s going to be a little cooler in New York and I sweat a lot,” Anderson said. “I like that aspect unless it rains or snows or something. Other than pitching here at Dodger Stadium, I can’t think of a better place to pitch in a playoff atmosphere. It’s pretty special.”\nThe Dodgers need Anderson to be more than special.\nAnderson became invaluable when injuries felled Brandon McCarthy and Hyun-Jin Ryu. He throws a typical repertoire: fastball, curve, slider, changeup. His best pitch is the two-seamer where he gets so many ground balls. Healthy, he made a career-high 31 starts this season. He battled back from 2011 Tommy John surgery but also dealt with other ails, including a strained oblique and stress foot fracture over the years.\n“He might have had better overall stuff when he was 17, 18 [because of] injuries. But he’s learned how to pitch a lot better,” said Clayton Kershaw, the Game 1 victim of deGrom and a teammate of Anderson on a national high school team. “His sinker [has] really separated him. He didn’t have that when he was younger. As long as I’ve known him, he’s always been able to spin two different breaking balls, a curveball and a slider. For him, it was always a matter of health.”\nSo the Dodgers are resting hopes on No. 3.\n“I can sit back and do my deal,” Anderson said of being behind Kershaw and Zack Greinke in the Dodgers’ rotation. “Let them be two of the best pitchers, then slide in behind them and hopefully give us a chance to win like I have for the most part of the year.\n“Then go about my business and be sarcastic and cynical.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brett anderson ,  los angeles dodgers ,  matt harvey ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:09:41.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
