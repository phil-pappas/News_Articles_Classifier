By FIFA law, the most senior vice president becomes the interim president. Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, the head of African soccer’s governing body, has assumed the role and is expected to arrive in Zurich early next week. Mr. Hayatou is not expected to work out of Zurich full time — and he will not sit in Mr. Blatter’s office — but he will lead an emergency meeting of FIFA’s executive committee that is expected to take place in the next two weeks. The day-to-day operations of FIFA are handled by Markus Kattner, who has been the acting secretary since Mr. Blatter’s top deputy, Mr. Valcke, was relieved of his duties last month in an unrelated ethics case. Will this affect Russia hosting the World Cup in 2018 or Qatar hosting in 2022? The short answer: probably not. These particular charges against Mr. Blatter and Mr. Platini are not related to the voting for those tournaments, though a separate investigation involving the Swiss authorities continues. It is all but certain that the 2018 tournament will go ahead as planned, since qualifying has begun and the draw for Europe — without Russia, which qualifies automatically as host — has been set. The Qatar tournament’s status is less sturdy, but there have been no indications that a new vote is in the offing. How has the global sports community reacted? With a big pile-on, as you might expect. Among other condemnations, Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, said “enough is enough” and called for a complete overhaul of FIFA’s governance. Chris Eaton, the executive director of the International Center for Sport Security, said, “Football, not just FIFA, stands on the precipice of disaster.” FIFPro, which is the union for international soccer players, said it had “little or no confidence in the ability of FIFA to reform from within.” How does this affect February’s special election for FIFA’s next president? Mr. Platini was the leading candidate, but now it is unclear whether he will be allowed to run. The same is true for Mr. Chung. Candidates are supposed to declare by Oct. 26. That deadline could be moved by FIFA’s executive committee and, hypothetically, the election could be delayed, too. Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan ran against (and lost to) Mr. Blatter in May, and he has said he will run again. The executive committee could, however, also vote to change FIFA’s statutes and allow outsiders — people from outside the soccer community — to enter the race. That could significantly alter the field. Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:28:39.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
