The Dallas Cowboys have named Matt Cassel their starting quarterback for their Oct. 25 tilt against the New York Giants , according to ESPN's Ed Werder . Cassel will replace Brandon Weeden , who has now lost his last 11 starts including a 0-3 record as the starter since Tony Romo broke his collarbone.\nAdChoices Dallas coach Jason Garrett said after a 30-6 loss to New England that he would re-evaluate the quarterback position during the Cowboys' bye week.\nCassel was acquired in a trade with the Buffalo Bills after Romo's injury. He spent the offseason in a quarterback battle in Buffalo with Tyrod Taylor and EJ Manuel . Taylor was named the starter, with Manuel serving as his backup.\nWeeden's first start wasn't bad, though the Cowboys lost to the Atlanta Falcons with him under center. Weeden completed 22 of 26 passes for 232 yards and no touchdowns, but an interception. He had trouble completing deep passes and the pick didn't help them in a game that was closer than the 39-28 final score would indicate.\nHis completion percentage dropped drastically in a 26-20 loss to the lowly Saints , as he hit on only 16 of 26 passes, but he was able to make plays downfield, averaging 15.4 yards per completion.\nEverything came apart on Oct. 11 against New England, though. Weeden completed two-thirds of his attempts, but only managed 188 yards in 39 passes and was also intercepted.\nCassel last played in the regular season with the Minnesota Vikings in 2014. He completed just 57.7 percent of his passes that year. On his career, he has completed 59.0 percent of his passes with 96 touchdowns and 70 interceptions.\nRomo is on short-term injured reserve, and is expected to return around approximately Thanksgiving.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Edwerderespn/status/654030873650720768", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/new-orleans-saints", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/1659/matt-cassel", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/atlanta-falcons", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152670/brandon-weeden", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/new-york-giants", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/131481/tyrod-taylor", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/minnesota-vikings", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/193279/e-j-manuel", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/buffalo-bills", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/dallas-cowboys"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:47:40.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
