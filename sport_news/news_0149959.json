The school provided clothes, backpacks full of food and gift cards to help the family.\nIt all happened through a little-known initiative called ABC Community School Partnership, or just “community schools.”\n“This experience has changed my life, and I am forever grateful,” Monique said Tuesday.\nThe program – jointly funded by Bernalillo County, the city of Albuquerque, the school district and private sources – is about to get some national recognition.\nThe national Coalition for Community Schools announced Tuesday that it has picked Albuquerque as the site of its leadership conference next year. The event is expected to draw about 2,000 attendees from across the country, officials said.\n“We want to highlight the important work you’re doing,” said Martin Blank, director of the national Coalition for Community Schools.\nThe “community schools” concept is aimed at making schools more than just a place where kids go during the day. Instead, the goal is to transform the schools into centers of the community – a hub where families can get help with homework or connect with services offered by other agencies.\nIn Albuquerque, the $2.3 million-a-year effort pays for coordinators at school sites who try to help families overcome anything that’s a barrier to their children’s learning, officials said. That can mean job training, health care or other services – with some programs paid for through the initiative and others offered by outside groups.\nIn Monique’s case, she said, the coordinator “actually lent me things from her own home, which was extremely touching.”\nMonique said she is now back on her feet, working full-time without relying on help from the school.\nThe local community schools effort is overseen by a board with membership from local governments and community groups.\n“This is one public-private partnership that is really working but is also one of Albuquerque’s best-kept secrets,” County Commission Chairwoman Maggie Hart Stebbins said.\nMayor Richard Berry said the city government is proud to be part of the movement.\n“This is cracking the code of just getting people together and lifting each other up,” he said.\nAbout two dozen schools are now considered full “community schools,” and about 60 others receive some kind of support through the program.\nAlso Tuesday, Lockheed Martin, on behalf of Sandia National Laboratories, and the nonprofit group Innovate+Educate announced donations of $10,000 each for community-school programs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:51:24.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
