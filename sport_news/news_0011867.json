I did not think it should have been targeting.\" \nThe call came back to haunt the Cardinals late in the fourth quarter when Ellis' replacement, freshman Rodney Randle , surrendered a 41-yard pass play on 3rd and 11 on the Lions' game-winning drive. \nOn the Cardinals' final drive, the rule was not enforced when Woodard believed it should have been. \nTrailing 30-27 with less than a minute remaining and on their own 17-yard line, the Cardinals ran a draw play to junior running back Kade Harrington . \nHarrington found space to the outside and was spun by a defender at his own 35-yard line, then was hit by a second defender with a shoulder to the helmet at the 37-yard line. \nThere was no flag thrown for targeting on the play, which saw Harrington immediately spring up and plead to the officials for a 15-yard penalty, which would have moved the Cardinals into field goal range. \nBased on Rule 9-1-4, however, running backs aren't deemed to be defenseless players, so there was no grounds to throw a flag and Lamar didn't pick up another first down. \n\"That's just how the rule is and that's just the interpretation of it I suppose,\" Woodard said. \"That's what I saw though.\" \nThe bigger argument Woodard could have made on Harrington's hit was that it was helmet-to-helmet contact, which constitutes the use of NCAA 9-1-3. \nRule 9-1-3 states that \"no player shall target and initiate contact against an opponent with the crown (top) of his helmet. When in question, it is a foul.\" \nHarrington's hit was questionable, so throwing a flag and having a replay review, even if it was deemed a clean hit, would have provided clarity. \n\"Kade's I thought was helmet to helmet and should have been targeting,\" Woodard said. \"That's how I saw it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:37:40.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
