I followed up and was fortunate enough to meet Lee Ellis, a first-generation, self-taught archery hunter who takes chasing big deer seriously. In 10 years as a professional deer manager and 13 years as a B&C measurer, I can honestly say I’ve never met anyone so passionate about finding, patterning and harvesting huge Georgia whitetails with a bow. \nOn Jan. 14, 2014, Lee got his first trail-cam pic of Achilles. The buck was a solid deer in the mid-140s. The buck regularly visited a summer protein feed station and grew significantly. When he shed his velvet in September, Lee was elated to see he had put on 30 inches of antler from the previous year. \nShortly after arriving at his stand on opening-day afternoon, Lee passed a nice 130-plus-inch 10-point. He heard something walking behind the 10-point, and sure enough, Achilles was following down the ridge. The moment of recognition sparked an immediate adrenalin rush that Lee could hardly contain. \nAfter the slow walk down the ridge, Achilles finally stopped broadside at 10 yards. Lee managed to rein in his adrenaline, come to full draw and release. The arrow hit higher than Lee wanted. \nAn hour later, Lee returned to find very little blood and half of his arrow shaft. Instead of hunting, Lee relentlessly scoured the woods for the remainder of September and most of October before finally giving up. \nHeartbroken, Lee decided to get back in the saddle and try to find another buck to hunt. He hung cams on other tracts of land. One was about 7 miles from his encounter with Achilles, and on Nov. 2, Eureka! Lee couldn’t believe his eyes when he checked his cards and found Achilles very much still alive. \nAfter hanging eight more cameras, Lee narrowed his potential hunting spots down and finally went in and found a text-book pinch point that was loaded with big buck sign. Of the eight cams, there was only one Achilles passed by with any pattern, and he was coming through one out of three days in the daylight. Lee put all his chips on this location and hunted eight consecutive days on the stand — without a sighting of Achilles. On day nine, Lee couldn’t hunt because of other obligations, and when he checked cards, he couldn’t believe his bad luck. Achilles came strolling right under his stand in broad daylight. \nThe funnel Lee was hunting was thick with cover and didn’t allow many shot opportunities on deer he was consistently seeing, so on Nov. 16, Lee went in to the stand midday and cut a new shooting lane. \nThe next morning Lee was in the stand 45 minutes before shooting light, and 20 minutes later he heard the tell-tale sound of a running deer coming right toward him. The deer stopped at 10 yards. In the moonlight, Lee could tell it was a doe, and she was staring directly under his stand behind him. Every couple minutes for more than 20 excruciating minutes, Lee heard walking footsteps behind him. He didn’t dare turn. \nFinally, daylight began to break. When shooting light was well established, Lee glanced over his shoulder. He was astounded to see Achilles about to enter the newly established shooting lane at 20 yards. Lee drew and released an arrow, which flew true and hit Achilles hard behind his shoulder. \nThe buck went 30 yards, laid down and lowered his head. Barely able to contain his emotions, Lee waited 30 minutes, climbed down and snuck out of the woods, deciding just to be safe he’d give the deer a solid two hours before claiming his amazing trophy. Unfortunately, three hours later when he returned to where Achilles was, there was no deer, just a pool of blood. Lee picked up the blood trail, bow in hand and began quietly trailing through the thicket by himself. After 300 yards and with the sun beginning its descent in the western sky, Lee found his buck. Lee was able to go up to him, say a prayer of thanks to the good Lord for allowing him to harvest such a trophy and hold the giant, 175-inch rack in his hands for the first time. \nFor the complete story, visit www.gon.com , and for timely deer season reports from local hunters, go to forum.gon.com. \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
