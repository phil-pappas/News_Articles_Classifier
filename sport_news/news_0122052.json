The Utes defeated USC 24-21 in 2014 to end a three-game skid to the Trojans. \nWhile it has been 100 years since the Utes defeated USC in Los Angeles, the two teams have only met 13 times overall, twice meeting in bowl games. USC holds a 9-4 series advantage. \nHere is a statistical look at the matchup between the No. 3 Utes and the USC Trojans: Utah is 16-2 when ranked in the AP Top 10 \nThe Utes moved up to No. 3 with the win over Arizona State, receiving 16 first-place votes, which is second only to No. 1 Ohio State. \nSaturday's game against USC marks the 19th time the Utes will enter a game ranked in the AP Top 10. In 16 out of the previous 18 games, the Utes came away with wins. \nMeanwhile, the Trojans are in unfamiliar territory, having been ranked in the AP Top 25 for 142 of their past 175 games. USC was ranked in the AP Top 25 this season until a 17-12 home loss to Washington Oct. 8. Utah is No. 1 in the nation in interceptions per game \nJust how good has the Utes' defense been this season? Utah leads the nation in interceptions per game with 2.17, grabbing a total of 13 opponent passes through six games. \nUSC quarterback Cody Kessler has thrown five interceptions on the season, including two in each of the last two games. \nThe Trojans have scored 44 points off of the 10 turnovers they've gained in 2015, while only allowing opponents to score 10 points on the seven turnovers they've given up. Utes top Pac-12 in rush defense \nWhile the Utes' secondary is prolific at creating turnovers, the rush defense has been spectacular as well. Utah is only giving up a Pac-12 best 113.5 yards per game on the ground, with the best performance of the season coming against Arizona State, surrendering just 15 yards on the ground on 28 carries. \nUSC's rushing attack is averaging 173 yards per game, but only 152.5 against ranked opponents. The Trojans are No. 4 in the Pac-12 in total offense with 510.7 yards per game, while the Utes are No. 3 in the Pac-12 in total defense, giving up 369.5 yards per contest. \nBoth Utah and USC rank in the top three in the Pac-12 in scoring defense, with the Utes allowing 19.5 points per game and USC 21.3, so don't expect a high scoring affair. USC head coaches and winning at the Coliseum \nUtah will face a different head coach when it takes on USC for the fourth straight season (Lane Kiffin 2012, Ed Orgeron 2013, Steve Sarkisian 2014, Clay Helton 2015). \nSaturday's contest between the Utes and Trojans will be interim head coach Clay Helton's first home game at the helm. The last seven USC head coaches have all won their first home game. Trojans have a fast strike offense \nThe Trojans run an up-tempo offense that can put points on the board in a hurry. USC's average scoring drive takes just 2:05, with the longest all season being 4:34 against Washington. As a result, USC has lost the time of possession battle in all but one game this season, a loss to Notre Dame. \nOn the flip side, Utah is No. 7 in the country in time of possession, controlling the ball for nearly 34 minutes per game. Utah's average scoring drive takes 3:34 off the clock, with the longest being 9:51 against Fresno State.
