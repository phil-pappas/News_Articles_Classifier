Russia denied it was to blame, despite repeated previous violations.\nThe Turkish army said that the craft had been warned three times by Turkish planes but had maintained course.\nIt was then \"downed by fire from our aircraft on patrol, according to the rules of engagement.\"\nThe statement did not say if the downed aircraft was manned or a drone. But a Turkish official told AFP in Ankara it was an \"unmanned aircraft\".\nThe army warned the air force would \"decisively\" implement Turkey's rules of engagement.\nThe US military believes the drone downed by Turkey was Russian, a US official said in Washington.\n\"All indications are, yes, it is a Russian drone,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official added there were no reports of the Syrian army using the type of drone that was shot down.\nTelevision pictures showed the military examining the crash site by the village of Deliosman in the southern Kilis region on the Syrian border.\nThe state-run Anatolia news agency published pictures of what it said was the downed craft lying upside down in the grass, showing it to be a small vehicle just a few feet in length.\nIt appeared to be a drone used for reconnaissance operations.\nAnalysts said that the drone was similar to drones used by pro-Russian separatist forces in Ukraine, some of which had been shot down.\n\"A good working assumption is that it's Russian,\" said Nick de Larrinaga, Europe editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, adding it was nonetheless different to a Russian Orlan 10 drone.\nBut Russia's military on Friday said all its planes in Syria had returned safely to base and its drones were \"working as normal\".\n\"All the Russian planes in Syria have returned to the Hmeimim air base after completing their tasks,\" defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told Russian news agencies.\n\"Russian unmanned aerial vehicles monitoring the situation on the territory of Syria and carrying out air reconnaissance are working as normal.\"\nTurkish Foreign Minister Feridun Sinirlioglu said Ankara had still not identified the drone. \"We will announce once the nationality is clarified,\" he said.\nHe said the drone had fallen three kilometres (1.85 miles) inside Turkish territory.\nTurkey had earlier this month bitterly complained about two violations of its air space by Russian warplanes operating in Syria.\nA NATO official said Turkey had not asked for NATO assistance or consultations over the downing.\n\"We understand that Turkish authorities are investigating the origin of the unidentified drone that was shot down,\" said the official in Brussels.\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu had warned on October 5 after the Russian air space violation that Ankara would activate military rules of engagement irrespective of who violates its air space.\n\"The Turkish armed forces are clearly instructed. Even it is a flying bird it will be intercepted,\" Davutoglu said.\nTurkey supports the moderate opposition in Syria and has been infuriated by Moscow's bombing campaign to support President Bashar al-Assad.\nSinirlioglu said that the Russian air strikes had not been aimed at striking at ISIS jihadists and were simply seeking to prop up the regime.\n\"This is not a method that will ensure Syria's unity. Nothing will emerge other than protracting existing chaos and war and more human losses,\" he said.\nSinirlioglu said the Russian strikes near the Turkish border could lead to dangerous situations. \"This is a serious issue that could lead to accidents.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:01:58.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
