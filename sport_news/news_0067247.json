The last encounter took place in February 2012, when Arjen Robben scored a stoppage time goal to give the Dutch a 3-2 win. \nUnlike England, who won all 10 qualifying matches, Holland failed to qualify for Euro 2016. \nDespite finishing third in the 2014 World Cup, they could only manage a fourth-placed finish in their European Championship qualifying group behind Czech Republic, Iceland and Turkey. \nEngland's next friendly is against Spain in Alicante on November 13. Four days later they host France at Wembley. They travel to Berlin to play Germany on March 26 before hosting the Dutch.
