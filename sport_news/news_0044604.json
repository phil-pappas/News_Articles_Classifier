Rodger Mallison Star-Telegram i Order Reprint of this Story ARLINGTON \nThis isn’t the first postseason rodeo for Jon Daniels, so he knows there’s no rush to get the Texas Rangers’ roster for the American League Division Series ready. \nAnd, truth be told, there aren’t too many decisions that have to be made by 9 a.m. Thursday. \nBreaking: Adrian Beltre will be on the roster. So will Cole Hamels. \nBut the decisions general manager Daniels and his front-office staff, the coaching staff and the scouting department are mulling over aren’t insignificant. \nThey need to collectively agree on the four starters from the five-man rotation who will pitch against the Toronto Blue Jays, beginning Thursday at the Rogers Centre. They must decide if they will go with seven or eight relievers, and, as a result, 13 or 14 position players. \nOf those position players, will five of them be outfielders or will three of them be catchers? Who will be the second left-hander in the bullpen? Who will be the bullpen’s swingman? \nThe Rangers started analyzing the possibilities last week and did so with more earnest Monday. \n“We haven’t had a chance to sit down and talk to any of the players that are involved, so it’s a little sensitive,” Daniels said. “We don’t want to release any of that until we’ve had a chance to talk to those guys first.” Jon Daniels on Rangers playoff roster taking shape Rangers GM Jon Daniels met with the media Monday and fielded many questions on the potential playoff roster (video by Jeff Wilson). \nDaniels said that manager Jeff Banister could reveal the Rangers’ rotation plans as early as Tuesday and possibly the entire roster. Yovani Gallardo and Derek Holland threw bullpen sessions Monday while most players were off, and the appear to be candidates for Game 1 on Thursday afternoon. \nDaniels said that the Rangers are leaning toward 11 pitchers and 14 position players, and the odd man out of the rotation has a good chance of landing in the seven-man bullpen. \nThe right-handedness of the Blue Jays’ lineup might point to having the two right-handers in the rotation, Gallardo and Colby Lewis, while lefty Martin Perez gets pushed out or into the bullpen. \nToronto led the majors in on base-plus-slugging percentage against lefties (.818), but, as the majors’ highest scoring team, they also led against right-handers (.791). The Rangers could be mulling who their best four pitchers are right now. \n“The way the team sets up, there really isn’t a ‘fifth starter,’ “ Daniels said. “All these guys have made cases to be included, and that’s a big reason we’re here. … You also don’t want to try to outsmart the process. At the end of the day, you want your best players out there deciding those games.” \n891 Runs scored this season by Toronto. The Blue Jays had a .463 slugging percentage vs. lefties, and a .455 mark vs. righties. All three led the major leagues. \nDaniels said that right-hander Keone Kela will be available even though he has dealt with elbow issues and arm fatigue for the past month, so he figures to be a bullpen lock with closer Shawn Tolleson and fellow set-up relievers Sam Dyson and Jake Diekman. \nThough right-hander Keone Kela hasn’t allowed a run since July 30, he made only nine appearances in September and October. Just four of those in the final two weeks. \nAfter that, though, the Rangers will have to decide between righties Chi Chi Gonzalez and Ross Ohlendorf for a spot as a reliever who can work multiple innings and if they want Sam Freeman or Andrew Faulkner to be the second lefty. \n“He was available [Sunday],” Daniels said of Kela. “Barring something unforeseen, our plan is to have him out there.” Jon Daniels talks about Keone Kela's postseason availability for Rangers Right-hander Keone Kela will be in the Rangers' bullpen in the division series despite some recent arm issues, Jon Daniels said (video by Jeff Wilson). \nRobinson Chirinos (left shoulder) has convinced the Rangers that he can be relied upon behind the plate along with Chris Gimenez. Bobby Wilson would be a third catch if the Rangers took that route. \nJosh Hamilton (left knee) answered any lingering doubts about his ability to be an everyday player during the final week of the season. Injuries are always an issue with Hamilton, so that could cement a spot for veteran bench piece Will Venable along with Drew Stubbs as the fourth and fifth outfielders. \nHamilton playing on the Rogers Centre turf, though, isn’t a concern for Daniels. \nNo more so than making a diving catch and banging into a wall. I don’t think the turf is going to be any more challenging than that catch was. \nJon Daniels on Josh Hamilton playing on artificial turf in Toronto \n“At this point with Josh it’s a health deal,” Daniels said. “Just like everything else with him, it never ceases to amaze you, whether it’s pinch-hitting a week after surgery, playing nine innings two weeks later or three weeks later making a diving catch into the wall. \n“From what I saw this weekend, I saw really good at-bats. He managed the swing-and-miss a little bit. In-game adjustments, the ability to control the strike zone, those are big things for Josh.” \nThe Rangers don’t have many decisions left to make for their division series roster, but the ones they are mulling over aren’t insignificant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:46:50.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
