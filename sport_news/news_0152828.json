He made both of his free throw attempts. Bryant hadn't played since logging nearly 30 minutes at New Orleans on Jan. 21. He underwent surgery later that month. \nDerrick Favors had 16 points and nine rebounds for the Jazz in the preseason opener for both teams. \nJAZZ: Favors scored 12 points in the first half. Gordon Hayward added 11 points and nine rebounds, Rudy Gobert had 10 points and eight boards, and Trey Burke added 10 points. \nLAKERS: Guard Lou Williams , who won NBA Sixth Man of the Year honors with Toronto last season, scored 14 points off the bench. Nick Young was the only other Los Angeles player to score in double figures, finishing with 10 points. \nBRYANT'S BACK: Bryant played the entire first quarter and sat the rest of the way despite numerous second-half chants of \"Kobe! Kobe!\" by the sellout crowd of 10,300 at the Stan Sheriff Center. His first shot, a jumper from the corner, hit the side of the backboard. \n\"I felt good. It felt good to get out there,\" Bryant said. \"(My legs) feel strong, I didn't feel tired at all. It's just about getting the timing down.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:42:36.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
