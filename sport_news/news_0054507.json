Actually changes -- lots and lots of changes. \nCharlene Curtis, the ACC Women’s Basketball Supervisor of Officials, who has served on the NCAA Women’s Basketball Rules Committee, said bluntly: “It’s a bold move on our part. I hope it’s the right move.” \nCurtis also noted that while officiating will not change, “the flow of the game will change.” And that’s the whole idea-to minimizes stoppages and speed up the game. \nHere are the major rules changes in women’s basketball: 1) Four Periods instead of two halves. 2) TV time outs reduced from 9 to 7. 3) Spacing of the time outs has changed. Instead of taking breaks near the 16, 12, 8, and 4 minute mark of each half, there will be one media time out taken in each period, somewhere around the 5 minute mark. There will be media time outs following the first and third periods, and there will be one bonus media time out in either the third or fourth period. 4) Coaches’ time outs will be reduced from 5 to 4, and only 3 can be carried over into the second half, (or should I say the last two quarters). There will be one full time out and three 30 second time outs. 5) When a coach calls a time out, in many cases that will become the media time out. 6) Teams will be allowed four personal fouls per quarter. The fifth foul generates a bonus shot. 7) All fouls above the limit will result in two free throws, except when a shooter scored the basket. There will be no more one-and-one bonus free throws in women’s basketball. 8) TV time outs will now run 2:45 instead of 2:30. However, the first horn will sound at 2:30 and the ball will be put in play immediately when the media break ends. 9) When a player fouls out, a coach will have just 15 seconds from the time the referee signals the fifth foul, to put in a substitute. Coaches who take longer will be assessed a technical. 10) The 10 second rule, added recently to the women’s game as a way of speeding movement across mid-court, has been tweaked. The clock will not be reset on most balls knocked out of bounds, unless the team on offense takes a time out. \nOne more dynamic rule change: In the final minute of play, teams can “advance the ball” when they call a time out. That means throw-ins along the sideline, 28-feet from the basket, instead of passing in bounds from the opposing baseline 94-feet away. OH, THE STRATEGY \nCoaches and players are still processing all these changes, but the new rules could have a significant effect on strategy. For example, the coach of a well-conditioned team may call a quick time out early in the second period. That time out then becomes the designated media break for that quarter. Players, who have grown accustomed to official time outs in four minute increments, may have to play nine minutes without a break. \nLook for some deep, athletic teams to go on big runs in the second quarter using this strategy, as the opposing team becomes fatigued. The strategy could also be used in the fourth period, provided the bonus media time out was taken during the third quarter. Officials’ Supervisor Curtis says she has already heard of some coaches who plan to use this quick time out strategy “to create long periods of uninterrupted play.” \nThe mere change from halves to quarters will also impact strategy. \nTeams that play without fouling will now have more opportunities to play aggressively. Georgia Tech coach MaChelle Joseph, who likes to press, looks forward to turning up the heat an extra notch at the end of each period when her team has fouls to give (fewer than five). To that, let’s add a comment from Duke’s Joanne P. McCallie, who likes the idea of playing “high intensity minutes in one period and then trying to do it again.” \nPlayers at Syracuse, three of whom, incidentally, are from Raleigh, report conditioning is being stressed in practice now more than ever. Quentin Hillsman, head coach of the Orange, says he can point to 15 possessions over the past few years, which, had they ended differently, could have changed the entire landscape of the Syracuse women’s program. Now, Hillsman sees an increased number of critical possessions in each game. As he puts it, “Will you make a play when you’re tired and your opponent is tired? It’s about toughness now.” \nBoston College’s Erik Johnson likes the “advance the ball rule.” He can see close games that end with a buzzer beater at one end (say with two seconds left), followed by another buzzer beater at the other end. \nMost of the new rules bring the women’s game more in line with the international game, and the rules of the world’s basketball sanctioning body, FIBA. Foreign players feel quite comfortable with the rules changes. \nVirginia Tech’s Vanessa Panousis, the player from “Down Under” who these days shoots her jump shots in “Downtown America,” says the rules “are now quite similar to ours back home,” adding that American women’s basketball will now have “a more international style.” \nBy the way, there are increasing numbers of Internationals playing in the ACC. INFLUENCE OF THE INTERNATIONALS \nEleven of the ACC’s 15 programs now count at least one international player on the roster. Florida State, one of the league’s upper echelon teams, has five players from Europe, Australia, and Canada. FSU’s Sue Semrau, one of the first to appreciate basketball’s going global, respects what international players bring to a program. \n“Think about the desire,” Semrau said, “That they would leave their home country to develop their game to a higher level.” \nClemson Coach Audra Smith, who has players from Canada and Italy, noteed that foreign players start learning the game at a very young age. \n“They are taught the fundamentals early,\" Smith said. \"They have a high basketball IQ.” \nVirginia Tech Coach Dennis Wolff, who also has recruited five foreign players for his program, likes the outlook of Internationals. \n“There’s a freshness to them being on scholarship,\" Wolff said. \"They don’t take anything for granted.” \nThe foreign players do however, have many adjustments to make. Adut Bulgak of Florida State, who has become one of the league’s best interior players, says she “never lifted a single dumb bell in Canada.” It took Bulgak some time to begin using the weight room in America, and adjust to this country’s much more physical style of play. \nPanousis likely speaks for many of the Internationals in the ACC when she talks about the appeal of “the great facilities. Plus,” she says, “you get to study and play basketball at a high level.” A YEAR TO REMEMBER \nAssessing all the great American players and the top Internationals now playing in the ACC, Senior Associate Commissioner for Women’s Basketball Nora Lynn Finch predicted the league will make its presence known in March. \n“We had eight teams chosen for the NCAA Tournament last year,” Finch noted. “We could do that again. This is going to be the best year for women’s basketball and the best year for the ACC ever. Mark that.” \nPart of what powers the ACC is incredible balance and depth. NC State’s Dominique Wilson, who transferred from Arkansas, said both the ACC and the SEC are competitive but added “The ACC is better top to bottom.\" Show up unfocused one time in the ACC and Wilson said “you could lose to Wake Forest (picked 14th) by 20.” \nThe ACC has a bunch of teams who have the ability to spring an upset. But here’s the question -- can anyone beat No. 1 Notre Dame? \nThe Irish, since coming over from the Big East, are two-for-two winning the ACC Championship. They have lost exactly one game in two years. I put the question (can anybody beat Notre Dame?) to Katie Meier, coach of the Miami team which actually last year beat Notre Dame. Meier did not give a direct answer, but she did make a bold prediction. \n“The discussion is about how many teams the ACC will send to the Final Four,\" she said. \"I think we’re going to send multiple teams to the Final Four.” \nBut if pre-season predictions are accurate, the Final Four contenders may not include Duke, North Carolina or NC State. In the ACC’s annual pre-season poll of coaches and select members of the media, only Duke is expected to finish among the top four -- to get one of the double byes in the season-ending ACC Tournament. UNC was picked seventh in the pre-season poll, and NC State ninth. \nCollectively, the three Triangle schools have not been projected to finish so far down in the standings since 1991. That year State was picked third, Duke seventh, and UNC ninth. GOOD CHEMISTRY AT DUKE \nDuke Coach Joanne P. McCallie likes the chemistry on her 2015-16 team. \n“It’s low drama,” she said. “We’re having a lot of fun.” \nDuke must replace center Elizabeth Williams, one of the great post players in league history, but with returning stars like Rebecca Greenwell and Azura Stevens, not to mention the best freshman class in America, the new Blue Devils expect to be formidable. Of the fourth place prediction, McCallie noted, “Fourth isn’t going to excite us. We have our work cut out for us. It’s the last poll that matters.” SYLVIA HATCHELL: WE’LL BE BETTER THAN OK \nNorth Carolina, which has suffered the defection of four key players amidst the NCAA’s investigation of long-ago academic fraud, will field a team with just eight scholarship players. Coach Sylvia Hatchell remembers a time when she won a national championship with eight scholarship players. \n“Everybody thinks we’re falling apart,” Hatchell exclaimed. “We’ve got some talent (three high school All-Americans). I’ve got the best coaching staff in America. We’re OK. We’re going to be better than OK.” \nBut it should be noted that with key minutes going at times to walk-ons, Hatchell expects to play more zone defense than in the past. JUST LIKE 2013-14 FOR NC STATE? \nAt NC State, coach Wes Moore hopes this year’s ninth place prediction will play out like that tenth place forecast two years ago. All NC State did in 2013-14, Moore’s first season, was to defy predictions, win 25 games and finish among the ACC’s top four. State also earned a bid to the NCAA Tournament that year. Moore believes he has recruited the skills needed for the Wolfpack’s “Four Out-One In” offense. \n“You’ve got to have players who can shoot the three,” Moore said, “Or else you’re playing 4 on 5. We have shooters. But the post has got to be able to score.” \nThat was a problem last year, but State has brought in three players 6-foot-3 or taller. \nThe league’s newest coach, Jeff Walz of second year member Louisville, obviously impressed voters with the players he’s assembled in the Cardinals’ program. Louisville is picked third this year. But Walz takes nothing for granted. \n“Top to bottom this is the best league in women’s basketball,” Walz said. “You have to bring your 'A' game every night or you’re going to lose.” \nThis year, that goes double for the teams that adapt to the new rules.
