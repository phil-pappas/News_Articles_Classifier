The sophomore defensive tackle sacked Buffaloes quarterback Sefo Liufau twice and sparked a once-dormant pass rush in Saturday’s 38-31 win over Colorado.\n“The sack master,” Kirelawich told his players, “can’t get tired for this week.”\n•••\nNCAA rules dictate that teams can train with only 105 scholarship players, a number that expands to 120 once the season comes around.\nBanda was told at the start of camp that he didn’t make the roster. He was No. 106.\nBanda’s parents encouraged him not to give up, and a high school coach told him to work out and prepare as if the Wildcats would ask him back.\nTwo days into camp, defensive lineman Timmy Hamilton left the team, opening up a spot on the 105-man roster. The Wildcats called up No. 106, and Banda — 6  feet 3  inches and 240 pounds — was back.\n“I like being under-looked and coming up,” Banda said, “but that does put a chip on my shoulder, having people above me. It makes me work harder.”\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats XTRA app: Get latest news, scores\nAdded Luca Bruno, his close friend and fellow defensive lineman: “He’s been trying to prove to everybody ever since that he can be that player, and that really came out last game.”\nThe last game was the Colorado one, and as another defensive linemen ahead of him on depth chart bit the dust — Anthony Fotu was suspended indefinitely — another opportunity opened up for Banda.\nThe sack master delivered.\nTwice late in the game, Banda ran around Colorado tackle Stephane Nembot — all 6  feet 7  inches and 320 pounds of him — and brought Liufau to the ground.\n“After the first one, I went up to him and gave him the biggest hug and said, ‘Finally, dude,’ ” Bruno said. “Then he did it again, and then almost got three. I was just loving it.”\nColorado quarterback Sefo Liufau is sacked by Arizona defensive linemen Jack Banda, left, as Jeff Worthy closes in during the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015, in Boulder, Colo.

The Cougars have a proclivity to drop back and pass the ball 50-plus times, meaning Arizona’s pass rush is vital to a win.\n“We took a chance (on Banda), thought he had to get bigger and stronger, and he has,” Rodriguez said. “He took a couple years, he’s been injured and sick, and now he’s making the most of his opportunity.\n“Now,” Rodriguez added, “he’s known as more of a pass rusher, which is certainly what we need this week.”\nAZCENTRAL\nNo controversy in UA quarterbacks' friendship\n•••\nBanda hails from Grayson, Georgia, about 45 minutes northeast of Atlanta.\nGrayson was founded in 1879 by James Patterson McConnell, who built the town’s first post office. Back then, the town was called “Trip” because a businessman in nearby Lawrenceville said it was such a haul getting to McConnell’s office building.\nNow Banda’s in the Old Pueblo, more than 1,800 miles from home.\n“I wanted to go somewhere crazy,” Banda said, Southern accent and all. “This was the one. It was all the way out West. I’ve never been out here; I’m just a Georgia boy, never really left Georgia, so I wanted to come out here and see what it was like. I knew I wanted to go out somewhere weird, somewhere crazy.”\nBefore last week, Banda was an unknown. Then he had two sacks against Colorado, making him the team leader.\nIt’s been a long trip.\nAZCENTRAL\nUA football facing puzzle in Mike Leach's Washington State\n•••\nThe Grayson High Rams are a powerhouse in Georgia high school football, often ranked nationally. That’s saying something in a state known for its hard-nosed, big-boy football. It is in SEC country, after all.\n“There’s great football in Georgia,” UA coach Rich Rodriguez said.\nBack in 2012, all eyes were on coach Mickey Conn’s squad.\nBig names littered the Grayson roster, particularly on defense. The biggest — Robert Nkemdiche, the No. 1 overall recruit that year — was desired by everyone. So, Grayson rarely went a week without a Division I coach in the stands, or a day without a request for highlight video.\nEven then, Banda was somehow overlooked.\nBanda finished his senior season with seven sacks. Nkemdiche had 18 and offers from everyone, including Alabama, Florida, LSU, Oregon and USC. Now, he stars at Ole Miss and is a near lock to be picked in the first round of the 2016 NFL draft.\nTry getting noticed around that.\n“I was always in the shadows,” Banda said. “They never talked about me.”\nTo get noticed, Banda e-mailed highlight videos to 50 schools around the country. Arizona noticed.\n“I thought that was awesome,” Banda said. “They liked me for me.”\nAZCENTRAL\nPac-12 football power rankings - Week 8\n•••\nThe media swarmed Banda after Wednesday’s practice. TV cameras, iPhones and recorders were stuck into the new standout’s face.\nOne week earlier, they wouldn’t have known Banda from a Panda.\nAs his teammates walked by, they shouted “Hey look, it’s Luca!”\nIt’s a running joke around the team — Banda and Bruno, a starter since the beginning of the season, look alike.\nMaybe now people will finally learn the name. Jack Banda, No. 92, defensive end, Arizona Wildcats.\nFrom unknown, overlooked, overshadowed and released, to now.\nWhat a trip.\n“I’m a patient guy,” Banda said. “I was just staying at it, and I finally got my chance. It was a great feeling to help the team out. I was waiting for my opportunity.\n“And,” he added, “I’m glad I got it.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3e3dc5609b68a052aab64c2c0e8a8984d09d5719/c=279-0-1702-1423/local/-/media/2015/10/21/Phoenix/Phoenix/635810597338547302-USATSI-8841580.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c47d660a401556d2cda0cdf550493e6d1fa9b13/c=87-0-612-525/local/-/media/2015/08/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635762183712997114-arizonawildcats.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb4f2a2c416ce679ef38c164122f8c9ba50140df/c=0-54-4086-3126&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Phoenix/Phoenix/635811528707180442-Banda2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8ffc7632601e80ff00fef42ef6946d9f1092c071/c=0-0-2324-2324/local/-/media/2015/10/19/Phoenix/Phoenix/635808930489568345-booker.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/Phoenix/Phoenix/635811528707180442-Banda2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f121bd945e79cfbe165c6d92b10523b588c4160/r=500x389/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Phoenix/Phoenix/635811528707180442-Banda2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1730f912ab26e9ca220149396b9dc63f4a13ee48/c=227-0-1805-1578/local/-/media/2015/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/635809708600444787-leach.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:35:23.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
