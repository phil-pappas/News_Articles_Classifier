Kevin Love, the third member of Cleveland's \"Big Three,\" dislocated his left shoulder in the first round against Boston. \nIman Shumpert, who started at shooting guard for most of the playoffs, is expected to miss three months with a right wrist injury sustained in an offseason workout. \nTristan Thompson, who played well at power forward in Love's absence during the playoffs, has not reported to training camp as he remains in a holdout for a long-term contract. \nOn Sunday, James called Thompson's situation \"a distraction\" and urged both sides to reach an agreement. \nAnderson Varejao, who missed most of last season with a torn left Achilles, started at center for the Gold team. \nJames, as he often does, got the crowd of 14,480 going with a trademark dunk. He scored six points in 12 minutes. \n\"It was a great turnout,\" James said. \"On a Monday night, we had that many fans, is unbelievable. We accomplished one thing, no one got hurt.\" \nCleveland opens the preseason Wednesday night against Atlanta in Cincinnati. Cleveland plays at Philadelphia on Thursday. It's unlikely James will play in both games. \n\"It has not been discussed yet, but I probably won't play in one of the two games,\" James said. \"I'm not sure if it's the front side or the back side. It would probably make more sense (to play) in Cincinnati since they don't get to see us a lot and then we go to Philly, and I'll probably be there in the regular season.\" \nThe Gold won the scrimmage, which consisted of three quarters, 55-49. Guard Quinn Cook, a rookie from Duke, led all scorers with 13 points. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:55:07.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
