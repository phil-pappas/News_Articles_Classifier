Cedar, 129\nSALT LAKE CITY — The Stansbury girls cross country team celebrated their first state title for about 15 minutes. Then they spent several hours wondering if the trophy they’d worked so hard to earn would be theirs.\n“The unsurety,” said senior Maggie Beazer, who sobbed when she learned her teammate wouldn’t be disqualified for stepping outside the marked course on a turn. “If we’d known we got second, we could have adjusted. It was the back and forth all day that was hard.”\nThere were a number of runners officials looked at disqualifying from several teams, including the top three finishers. Eventually, judges opted not to disqualify any of the runners and leave the results as they were.\n“I think it was stressful for a lot of schools, a lot of runners,” said Stansbury cross country coach Randy Quarez. “It’s tough when it comes down to some technicalities, some issues. But we’re proud of them regardless of what happened.”\nHe said he understood the issues the judges raised and said there were some changes that needed to be made before next year.\n“There are some things we’ve got to fix,” Quarez said, “obstacles and challenges for the runners. We’ve got to make sure we have them corrected for next year when we set up the course.”\nBeazer said that while their trophy celebration may have been delayed, it was well worth the wait — and the effort the girls gave in the months leading up to the season.\n“This is the culmination of a dream we’ve talked about for a year at least,” Beazer said. “My freshman year the team got eighth. So the transformation has been the best thing I’ve ever experienced.”\nStansbury edged Pine View for the team title by a single point in the girls race, while the Desert Hills boys beat Pine View’s boys 32-59 with Stansbury finishing third with 76. Union sophomore Kennedy Powell won the 3A individual title with a time of 18:58.4. She finished third last year as a freshman and knew she had a shot at a championship this season.\n“It was a bit harder than I was expecting,” Powell said. “I went out a little too quick. I kind of died out toward the end, and they almost caught me. Luckily, I held out just long enough.”\nShe said that she couldn’t take the credit for her first state title.\n“I can’t give myself credit for winning today,” she said. “I owe all the credit to God because he gave me this ability. I thank God for allowing me to do this.”\nStansbury sophomore Zoe Hales finished second (18:59.4) and Desert Hills Bailey Brinkerhoff was third (19:00.5).\nPine View senior Nick Hill won the individual championship with a time of 15:43.5. McKade Steffensen, Canyon View, was third with a 15:50.6, and Desert Hills junior Jaiden Melendrez was third with a time of 16:00.4.\n“I just focused better in this race,” Hill said. “I put in another great season of training and I pulled it out. I’ve had this goal since eighth grade. I knew I could do it all season.”\nFor the third consecutive year, Desert Hills won the boys title.\nCoach John Powell said the pressure of being the favorite is a unique mental burden.\n“It’s totally different,” he said. “We didn’t run quite as well as we would have liked, but we still rocked it.”\nHe said the group is very cohesive and that makes them better individually.\n“It’s amazing,” Powell said of the team’s chemistry. “This team probably as much or more than anything just really bonded. They all come together in these races. There is just a brotherhood, I don’t know how else to describe it.”\n3A girls results \n1. Kennedy Powell, Union, 18:58.4; 2. Zoe Hales, Stansbury, 18:59.4; 3.
