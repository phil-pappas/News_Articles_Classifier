Some had christened him the conference’s favorite to dethrone Smart without playing a game.\nIn the photo the thin, 6-foot-8 Wiggins looks nervous, uncertain. Maybe that had something to do with the muscular 6-foot-3 sophomore standing next to him. Smart, shoulders stretching his orange Cowboys polo shirt, stared flatly at the camera.\nSmart later told a USA Today reporter that he wasn’t sold on the prediction, saying: “A lot of people are saying he’s the best player in college basketball. I’m saying how can you be the best player if it’s something you haven’t even played in?”\nThen-Oklahoma State junior Markel Brown remembers the result on the floor — two man-against-kid encounters between his Cowboys teammate and Wiggins.\nSmart took on the defensive assignment and pushed Wiggins all over the floor, muscled the scorer into a pair of uncomfortable nights.\n“That’s exactly it. He held Wiggins to his lowest points in a game in his college career, which is huge,” said Brown, now a Nets guard. “It definitely was a challenge for him, especially with Marcus coming back his sophomore year, and Wiggins coming in and them saying No. 1 pick, No. 1 pick.\n“It was a game to look forward to. It was Kansas. Who wouldn’t be excited to play against Kansas.”\nBrown and the Nets will play the Celtics for the second time this preseason tomorrow night, this time in the Garden. It will be Brown’s first chance this fall to see his college teammate — Smart was ill for the first encounter — but he doesn’t need to see for himself what has happened one year into the Celtics point guard’s career.\nBrown sees a better shooter, a player with polish.\n“In college he played at one pace, but ever since he got into the league he’s played at different paces,” Brown said last week. “He’s been getting to his spots and he’s been shooting the ball well — better than he did in college. He’s just growing as a player.”\nThose who were down on Smart after his sophomore season claimed he would never be a good shooter, which is not the same thing as an aggressive shooter.\nBrown believes that by not losing his willingness to take the biggest shots, Smart made himself better in the NBA.\n“Never shy which is a good thing, but it’s good to see that he’s found his stroke,” said Brown. “I would say his shooting ability is what has surprised me about him. He’s shooting the ball with a lot more confidence. It comes from repetition. I’m glad to see that he’s come out of that slump from college.”\nThat so-called slump affected Smart’s draft status. Wisdom held that he never should have returned to Oklahoma State for his sophomore season — a decision Smart made under the belief that he wasn’t ready for the NBA.\n“I think he pressured himself because of his drive to do well. It happens to the best of us,” Brown said. “I wouldn’t say he veered off too much. He did a lot of great things to help us out.”\nBut now when Brown looks at Smart, he sees a bigger, stronger point guard who is starting to get to the basket and draw contact in the same fashion as he did in college.\n“He’s definitely physically stronger — it’s a natural thing for him, and he uses strength well,” Brown said. “On defense he corrals big guys and pushes them off where they want to be, and he’s smart, he plays the passing lanes. He’s just becoming himself more and more.\n“I definitely see him using his body more, and it goes back to him using his big body, because he’s big for a guard. He’s very smart at picking his spots and knowing when to shoot it, or jump into the defender.”\nSmart became so good at this in a short time at Oklahoma State, teammates became accustomed to following his lead.\nLeadership is the other Smart element that Brown can attest hasn’t been eroded by his general NBA youth.\n“That doesn’t surprise me at all that he’s still considered a leader,” Brown said. “When he came in his freshman year, he was the leader of the team, telling guys what to do as if he’s been there before. It’s a God-given ability for him to lead a team — off the court as well as on the court. That’s just within him.”\nBrown was a year ahead of Smart, and were it any other player, he would have thought twice about following a freshman’s lead.\n“(But) you can’t help but listen, because he’s going to go out on the court and give it his all,” Brown said. “If he’s going to go out there and fight and battle for me, why not listen to him.”\nThis week’s\nC’s timeline\nTomorrow vs. Nets, 7:30 p.m. — Brooklyn coach Lionel Hollins agrees with those who wish these games could be played against opposition outside the Atlantic Division. Instead, the teams meet for the second time in five days.\nThursday vs. Knicks, 7:30 p.m. — What’s that about five days between games? The Celtics also wait that long for their second matchup with New York. Divisional games will be old before we reach December.\nFriday vs. 76ers (at Manchester, N.H.), 7:30 p.m. — Now for a change of pace . . . the Sixers. By the time the C’s wrap up their exhibition season at the Verizon Center tonight, they could be feeling quite good about themselves. That’s what this particular divisional diet can do for you.\nNBA FAMILY PULLING FOR RECOVERY BY LIKEABLE ODOM\nThe sadness of Lamar Odom’s hospitalization following a reported overdose on cocaine and Viagra seems to have hit just about everyone who knows the former Laker and Clipper. All agree that Odom is troubled. All also agree he was one of the nicest people in the league.\nWalter McCarty’s NBA career intersected the early part of Odom’s, and the Celtics assistant coach had a familiar response.\nMcCarty remembers Odom’s play for his uncommon mix of size and skill.\n“He was 6-foot-9, long, with a guard handle, very competitive,” he said. “It was always fun to play against him. You knew you had your work cut out for you. He was also a great guy.\n“To see him go through this is tough, but a lot of guys go through a lot of different issues. It’s always tough to see a person you know go through some hard times like this.\n“Unfortunately this is the NBA and there are hundreds of guys like that. In a perfect world you can say, ‘What if this didn’t happen?’ But it’s not a perfect world and people have issues. Hopefully, he has another chance to do it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:23:14.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
