Only two of those 15 exhausted their NCAA eligibility at UGA (and are now in the NFL), one saw his playing career tragically be cut short by a serious medical concern, some just decided to transfer, some were kicked out and are currently providing Georgia fans with ammunition in the battle for the moral high ground. No matter the reason that these DBs are no longer on the team, losing 15 over a five-year period is devastating for veteran leadership on the field and in the locker room. \nBut wait, it gets worse! Of all the DBs signed since 2011, only 14 remain on the team. Take into consideration that of these 14, three have been seriously bitten by the injury bug and haven't had much of a chance to contribute thus far. Of these 14, seven are true freshmen signed in the 2015 recruiting class. I think it's safe to say we're dealing with a paper-thin and very young secondary between the hedges. \nAlright, so there's the doom and gloom. Ready for a little bit of sunshine? Take a look at the 2014 recruiting class, the first class that current defensive coordinator and DB coach Jeremy Pruitt had any say in whatsoever. Two of Georgia's current starters were in that class, and we pretty much have no one else but Pruitt to thank for swooping in and snatching Dominick Sanders away from UCF at the last minute. Shaq Jones was a bust, but even the greatest of recruiting programs don't always strike gold. I mean, Alabama signed Jonathan Taylor... \nThe long and the short of this post is this: Georgia has been hit extremely hard with attrition in the secondary over the past five recruiting classes. Part of the numbers problem is a result of poor recruiting and/or undersigning, part of it is due to natural attrition (like graduation and transfers to seek more playing time, which both happen), part of it is due to players getting kicked off the team, part is just due to bad luck. \nIt seems as if this is a trend currently being reversed. Attrition has been minimal so far since the 2014 recruiting class. The 2015 recruiting class was jam-packed with highly-recruited impact DBs who are already making a difference in Athens. Imagine how the secondary will look in just one year if Coach Pruitt continues to recruit and develop players at the level on which he is operating. The 2015 signees are already getting plenty of meaningful playing time (both on defense and in special teams) and will be battle-tested, self-confident veterans by the time the 2016 class sets foot on campus. This is the kind of continuity that has been lacking in the Georgia secondary. This is the kind of continuity that I suggest you get used to.
