Image 23 of 23 Brunswick soccer team downs Kent, improves to 7-0 1 / 23 Back to Gallery \nOne by one, the Brunswick School soccer team has defeated the opponents it was beaten by last season. And the Bruins have done so in eye-opening fashion. \nSaturday, Kent School became the latest squad to fall to the Bruins after handily defeating them last season. The Lions registered a five-goal win a year ago, but Saturday, they quickly learned that this was a different Bruins’ team. \nResurgent Brunswick ran its record to a perfect 7-0, recording a decisive 3-1 victory over visiting Kent School in a WNEPSSA matchup. \nSenior forward Sal Lopez scored on a penalty kick, while freshman twin brothers Will and James Sands — two of the players who have sparked the Bruins’ success — each had one goal in the winning effort. \n“This is amazing — the turnaround from one year to the next,” said Lopez, a co-captain. \n“We have the desire to win and I notice in the locker room and during practice sessions that we come into every game thinking we will win. That helps a lot.” \nWil Salomon , the Bruins’ senior goalie made six saves. \n“We are having a lot of fun right now,” Salomon said. “Beating able to beat teams like Kent after they beat us last year and the year before feels awesome.” \nThe Bruins quickly took a 1-0 edge, as Lopez booted a penalty kick past Kent goalie Aayush Shah (10 saves for the game) inside the left post in the fourth minute. \nBrunswick increased its advantage to 2-0 in the 34th minute, courtesy of some nifty teamwork from the Sands brothers. \nJames Sands directed a through ball to Will Sands , who got past a defender in the box and knocked a shot past Shah, who came out high in an attempt to retrieve the ball. \nThe home team had possession the majority of the opening half, with forward Will Sands, Lopez, midfielder Dante Polvara, forward Nate Stuart and midfielder James Sands spreading the field and effectively moving the ball. \n“Our motto is to keep possession and tire them out, so in the second half we could break them down a little bit more,” Will Sands said. “Everyone’s happy because we’ve had a major turnaround from last season.” \nSaid Bruins first-year coach Christian Gonzalez : “There is no question our team is getting used to winning, which is a good thing, because they are developing a winning mentality. They are expecting to win every game now, which is fantastic.” \nKent (2-4-1) cut Brunswick’s lead to 2-1 when junior striker Ema Twumasi tallied with 37:31 remaining in the second half. The Lions were able to put more pressure on the Bruins in the second half than they did in the first. \n“We just tried to get their attention a little bit by working hard, it’s as simple as that,” Kent coach Tim Booth said. “While we changed momentum in the second half, we didn’t play a complete game and we didn’t deserve a result.” \nBooth left the game impressed with what he witnessed from the surging Bruins. \n“They are an excellent team,” Booth said. “They are fundamentally sound, they play their system well and they work hard.” \nBrunswick was awarded its second penalty kick of the afternoon after Kent was called for a foul in the box with 25:02 to go in the second half. This time, James Sands converted the penalty kick, making it 3-1. \n“I thought their coach would be asking for a response from them in the second half and they certainly got one,” Gonzalez said. “He (Twumasi) is a quick and powerful player. But we were able to respond.” \nSalomon kept the score 3-1, making two key saves off a Lions corner kick in the 70th minute. The Bruins effectively marked Kent’s top offensive players, one of whom was Twumasi, throughout. Senior Jared Boothe , freshman Ben Powers, junior Clement Carter and senior Grant Quackenbush helped anchor the Bruins’ consistent defensive effort. \n“Our backline really plays well together,” Salomon said. “My job is easier because of them.” \nBrunswick, which has yielded only 10 goals in seven games while scoring 25, will look to continue its winning streak when it travels to Trinity Pawling School on Wednesday. They will then host Choate Rosemary Hall on Homecoming/Senior Night on Friday. Currently, the Bruins are ranked second in WNEPSSA, with South Kent being the top-ranked team. \n“We have seen steady improvement and we hope to be peaking when we are in the postseason and when we are going for a run at the championship,” Gonzalez said. \ndavid.fierro@scni.com; 203-625-4423 \nKENT 0 1 — 1 \nBRUNSWICK 2 1 —3 \nGoals: K — Ema Twumasi; B — Sal Lopez, Will Sands, James Sands; Assists: B — James Sands; Goalies : K — Aayush Shah (10 saves); B — Wil Salomon (6 saves). \nRecords: Brunswick 7-0; Kent 2-4-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:37:42.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
