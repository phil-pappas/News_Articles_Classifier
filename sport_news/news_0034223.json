If I had my way, I'd give this musical a 10 on 5. It was spectacular. The casting was spot on. The sets were brilliant, and the production value was absolutely spectacular. My wife, who has seen the New York Broadway version of Beauty and the Beast , said that this was probably better than the one she saw eight years ago.\nGrowing up watching the animated version of Beauty and the Beast , I always wondered how the live musical would match up. After all, how can one replicate a live talking clock, a talking candle and a talking pot of tea? But in the immortal words of Walt Disney, \"Nothing is impossible!\" I was mesmerised and am still reeling from the grand premier of Beauty and the Beast that made its Indian debut at the NSCI Dome on Wednesday evening.\nWhile drawing parallels with the animated version, there are some striking differences, particularly the missing battle where all the instruments and objects in the castle drive out the villagers when they come to attack the Beast. There were four additional songs â€” two sung by Belle (Mistry) and two by the Beast (Joseph).\nWhen it comes to performances, Mistry gave Belle the perfect balance of being free-spirited, yet vulnerable. Her singing, especially in the song There was something that wasn't there before shows her versatility, particularly when she realises that she is falling for the Beast. Joseph's singing voice was the highlight of the show. He showed rage, sadness, worry, disgust and joy effortlessly, which also explains his opera training.\nHowever, the best performance in my opinion was Malukani as Gaston. Shrewd, arrogant, jealous and cocky, Malukani played the villain you love to hate. He was ably supported by Varun Narayan, who also played the same character for a few scenes in the play.\nThe choreography and the singing performances brought the animated classic to life and Terrance Lewis and Suzanne D'Mello deserve a huge thumbs up for the work they have done with the actors. The visualisation and performance in Belle, Be Our Guest and Human Again , in particular, stood out because of the intense choreography, accompanied by high notes.\nThe ticket prices may seem steep, but it's an experience that you need to have at least once in your life. Hopefully, with the response Beauty and the Beast got on its opening night, it will make a lot of money, and Disney could allow more Broadway musicals such as The Little Mermaid, Mary Poppins and perhaps, even Fantasia to be part of our lives.\nBeauty and the Beast\nStarring: Meher Mistry, Edwin Joseph, Hitesh Malukani and others\nDirected by: Vikranth Pawar\nRating : 5/5", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/+JayadevCalamur"], "published": "2015-10-24T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:14:35.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
