(AP) - The game between No. 7 LSU and South Carolina on Saturday is being moved to Baton Rouge because of ongoing problems after flooding around Columbia. Gamecocks officials said Wednesday the kickoff time has not been announced for the Southeastern Conference matchup. University of South Carolina President Harris Pastides says he cancelled classes this week because 34,000 students were too much for the recovering city, so 84,000 people coming for a football game would overwhelm the area. Authorities were worried about diverting law enforcement from clean up duties. There also are dozens of roads in the Columbia area closed from flood damage. Gamecocks coach Steve Spurrier says he wanted to do the right thing for the healing community and will get his team ready to play the unexpected road game. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
