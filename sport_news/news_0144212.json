By Mark Lelinwalla Posted: 10/19/2015 08:24 AM EDT \nWhen executed correctly, a fake punt can catch an opposing team off guard and set up a huge play. \nWhen used wrong, though, a fake punt can make a team the laughing stock of the NFL. \nThe latter was the case during the New England Patriots ' 34-27 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday Night Football , when the Colts' attempt to fake punt on a crucial fourth-down possession in the fourth quarter backfired in the worst way imaginable. \nInstead of getting into a normal formation, the Colts had punter Pat McAfee line up out wide right, with only Griff Whalen at center and safety Colt Anderson lined up behind him to take the snap. \nThe results? Pure embarrassment, which Colts coach Chuck Pagano took full responsibility for after the game. \nJust terrible. The play call headlined a running theme in Week 6 of teams only fooling themselves. Here are other instances that support that theme. \nSeahawks Thought They Had Panthers Beat, Sherman and Chancellor Argue \nLess than a minute from victory, the Seattle Seahawks were shocked when Cam Newton found Greg Olsen for a game-winning 26-yard touchdown pass in a Carolina Panthers 27-23 win. The play definitely caught Legion of Boom stars Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor off guard, as Seattle's star cornerback and safety argued about coverage on the game-deciding play. Just like that, the Seahawks dropped to 2-4, instead of 3-3, while the Panthers just keep rolling to a 5-0 record. \nSteve Smith Does the Pee-Wee Herman Dance \nWhen you've played 15 seasons in the NFL, you can do what you want to do when scoring a touchdown. Steve Smith Sr. knows. After catching a 34-yard bomb Sunday, the veteran receiver broke out with his rendition of the old-school Pee-Wee Herman dance . Why not? Too bad, Smith's Baltimore Ravens lost to the San Francisco 49ers 25-20. \nBET Sports News â€” Get the latest news and information about African-Americans in sports, including weekly recaps, celebrity news and photos of your favorite Black athletes. \n(Photo: TheNeutralZone via Vine via NFL) Videos You May Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:20:02.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
