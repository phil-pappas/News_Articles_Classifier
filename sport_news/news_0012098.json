Lauderdale \nPosted 10:50 p.m. yesterday   You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters More on this 10/10: Something borrowed, something new: RailHawks swamp Jacksonville, 3-0 By Neil Morris \nFT. LAUDERDALE/WEBCAST — As rapid as the Carolina RailHawks’ peripeteia from the NASL cellar to playoff berth contender occurred over the past week, it took only 90 minutes for their renewed optimism to evaporate into the Lockhart Stadium troposphere Saturday night. The kinetic energy came compliments of the hometown Fort Lauderdale Strikers, who blitzed the RailHawks, 4-0. \nWith two wins on the trot, the RailHawks found themselves in newfound control of their postseason fortunes. The remaining mission was arduous: win each of their final three matches of the regular season, starting with roads games tonight at Fort Lauderdale and next weekend at Tampa Bay. \nHowever, Carolina quickly felt several adverse effects Saturday evening at Fort Lauderdale. First was the loss of midfielder Nazmi Albadawi, who netted three goals during the RailHawks’ two wins this week. Albadawi reportedly broke the 5th metatarsal bone in his right foot while scoring against FC Edmonton Wednesday night, and he’ll miss the rest of the season. \nSecond was the fatigue of playing three games in eight days, coupled with an already thin roster, as witnessed by the removal of forward Daniel Jackson in the first half, and midfielders Neil Hlavaty and Alex Perez early in the second stanza. Finally, Carolina clashed with a focused, speedy Strikers squad that had lost three of its last four games, but all against two (Minnesota and Ottawa) of the top three teams in the league. \nThe Strikers’ scoring onslaught started in the 21st minute. Stefano Pinho delivered a ball off right wing that sailed over the RailHawks defense—including makeshift right back Austen King—and found Frankie Sanfilippo unmarked on the far post. Sanfilippo’s flat-footed header looped over leaping goalkeeper Akira Fitzgerald to put the Strikers up 1-0. \nFort Lauderdale doubled their advantage in the 30th minute. Jonathan Borrajo drove towards the end line before firing a shot from an acute angle that appeared to graze the underside of the crossbar. The deflection altered its trajectory into the back of the net for a 2-0 lead entering halftime. \nThe drubbing continued after intermission, In the 48th minute. Pinho centered the ball to Marlon Freitas atop the penalty arc. Freitas’ one-touch curler found the left upper 90 to increase the Strikers’ advantage to 3-0. \nThe scoreline bulged to 4-0 in the 56th minute. A through ball found Freitas streaking past RailHawks defender Connor Tobin. Freitas generously laid the ball over to a sliding Pinho, who poked in the sitter for his league-leading 16th goal. \nThe RailHawks’ offense remained inert—officially, Fort Lauderdale outshot Carolina 14-4. Meanwhile, Carolina’s defense reverted to the calamitous clan that surrendered goals in bunches over the bulk of the NASL fall season. One key factor was the altered composition of a back line that didn’t surrender a goal in the run of play during the last two home victories. With starting left back Kupono Low active but on the bench, reportedly suffering the effects of food poisoning, godsend Steven Miller—who arrived to Carolina on loan in time to play right back for last Saturday’s victory over the Jacksonville Armada and remained there for Wednesday’s win over FC Edmonton—shifted to the left and center back King was slotted at right fullback. The result is the most goals Carolina has surrendered in a game this year. \nThe RailHawks (8-8-12, 32 pts.) remain seventh in the NASL combined season standings. But Carolina has only two games remaining in their regular season and trails fourth-place Fort Lauderdale by five points plus an insurmountable goal-differential. \nCarolina travels to the Tampa Bay next Saturday before returning to WakeMed Soccer Park for the regular season finale on Oct. 30 against Indy Eleven. \nBOX SCORE LINEUPS CAR: Fitzgerald, King, Tobin, Scott, Miller, Perez (Thompson, 60’), Hlavaty (Osaki, 60’), Shipalane, da Luz, Jackson (Engel, 40’), Novo FTL: Meves, Borrajo, Graye (Smith, 72’), Sanfilippo, Guerrero, Marcelin, Thomas (Gonzalez, 63’), Ramirez, Freitas, PC (Gabriel, 76’), Pinho \nGOALS FTL: Sanfilippo, 21’ (Pinho); Borrajo (30’); Freitas, 48’ (Pinho); Pinho, 56’ \nCAUTIONS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:49:57.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
