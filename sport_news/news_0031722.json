I would imagine there might be a few students who would be uncomfortable performing at The Grotto; they certainly have the option to not participate — so let's always cater to the few and not give anyone a choice.\nAs a nice Jewish boy who grew up singing Christmas carols in the Parkrose High School choir at The Grotto every year, my experience expanded my community, broadened my worldview and was one of the highlights of the year for me. I never felt less Jewish. It was about the music and the beauty of the season, which we all share in this country.\nWith a Jewish accent: So what's the problem?\nMichael Allen Harrison\nSouthwest Portland\nHarrison is a composer, pianist and artistic director who's released more than 50 albums.\n•\nPPS choirs at The Grotto: The editorial board writes that Portland Public Schools general counsel Jollee Patterson told administrators that there was a performance ban because there was merit in a complaint filed by the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation. One issue here is an institution opting to take no legal risk, rather than evaluating what level and factors of legal risk may actually be at hand. If PPS adopted the position that there is a historical and enriching aspect that benefits the students apart from the location of the performance, what would the potential result be? First an actual complaint would need to be filed in court. There is certainly some potential for judicial support for the program. Second, if PPS loses the case, is there a likelihood of any significant damages being assessed? That should be publicly evaluated.\nI'm an atheist. I don't object to holiday traditions; I was raised with them, too. I see no reason to be absolutist on musical performances by students, as long as the public institution can show that they perform in a variety of venues and do not overtly tilt towards locations that may be affiliated with religious institutions.\nBob Woods\nSalem", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:33:32.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
