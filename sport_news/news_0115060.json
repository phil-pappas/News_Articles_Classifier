It’s win and keep going or one and done. So I hope they are.” Six area teams earned playoff spots – down one from a year ago. And while four teams knew they were in after finishing in the top three in their conferences, two others had to hope for entries as wild cards. As it turned out, Jacksonville and Swansboro did get in, giving the Coastal 3-A Conference five teams in the postseason for the second straight year. And while the Cardinals are seeded 27th in the 32-team field, the Pirates are No. 32 – in, but just barely. “We get to play another day,” Swansboro coach Kim Miller said. Of the six area teams in the postseason, only two will be at home. All first-round games are Saturday, with the second round next Tuesday. Croatan (15-3), which is the highest area seed at No. 8, will play host to No. 25 Hertford County while No. 13 East Duplin (14-6) will entertain No. 20 Northeastern (12-8). The Panthers finished second in the East Central 2-A Conference to Croatan, which won the title for a second straight year. The area’s other 2-A playoff team is Dixon (8-11), which was third in the ECC. The No. 22 Bulldogs travel to No. 11 North Pitt (8-3). In the 3-A playoffs, Richlands (12-8) is seeded No. 20 after finishing third in the Coastal Conference and will travel to No. 13 Lee County (12-4) while Jacksonville (10-7) heads to No. 6 Wilson Hunt (15-6) and Swansboro (9-10) is at No. 1 Cedar Ridge (20-2). Here’s a look at each opening-round game: Richlands-Lee County After having not made the playoffs for 12 years, the Wildcats are making their second straight postseason trip under coach Ashton Allgood. Richlands has won three of its last four – the only loss was at Croatan – and is coming off a 3-0 win over Swansboro. “We definitely had a great game versus Swansboro. It was one of the best we’ve played all season,” Allgood said. “So that’s exciting going into the playoffs.” So is earning consecutive playoff berths. “It’s exciting, definitely,” Allgood said. “This will be my first year of graduating seniors. It’s exciting to watch them grow and to watch them help to lead our younger players.” Page 2 of 3 - Lee County, which lost in the regional finals a year ago, has won six straight. Jacksonville-Hunt Jacksonville used a strong second-half surge to finish tied for fourth in the Coastal Conference, winning their last four and six of last nine – including a 3-2 win over West Craven, which finished second in the league. It is the Cardinals’ sixth straight trip to the playoffs. Coach Destiny Ma’ave Kuewa couldn’t be reached for comment. Hunt, which lost in the first round of the playoffs last year, also comes in riding a winning streak. The Warriors won their final five games – all by 3-0 scores – and have won nine of their last 10. Swansboro-Cedar Ridge There were a few anxious moments for Miller, not so much overnight but during the two hours between when the preliminary brackets were released and when they were finalized, after the NCHSAA and coaches made sure there were no errors in records. “The countdown to 1 o’clock was a little nerve-racking,” Miller said as she swept the gym floor before practice. “Teams could have submitted the wrong records and ... you don’t know if that could have happened and it changes the seeding and it bumps you out.” Projections this week had the Pirates as a No. 31 seed. As it turned out, that was one off and pits them against a team that a year ago lost in the regional semifinal to eventual state champion Cardinal Gibbons. “Hey,” Miller said, “you never know, on any given day.” Hertford Co.-Croatan A year after advancing to the 2-A East Regional semifinals, Croatan is back – and coach Erica Heimforth is looking for even more from her Cougars, who have won five straight and 10 of their last 11. And she believes last year should help this time around. “The more you’re there, the more experience you have, the more comfortable you feel as things progress,” she said. “So it’s nice to be able to lean on that. Also, I think it gives them that drive to want to do (the same) or better than what we did last year.” Can they? “Let’s hope so. That would be fun,” she said. “We’re excited. This is the time of the year we thrive on, rise to the challenge or go home. So we just can’t wait to get things started.” Hertford, which lost in the opening round a year ago, lost its regular-season finale and has dropped three of its last five matches. Page 3 of 3 - Northeastern-East Duplin East Duplin won’t be at its best because of the loss of two starters – both seniors. Setter Mary Wallace and middle hitter Toni Sinclair will be in Washington for a history trip planned a month ago and “which just happened” to coincide with the opening round of the playoffs, Turner said. The result is Turner is having to tinker with her rotation. “We’re trying to make as little of a change in the rotation as we can,” she said. “I’ve got several options.... Obviously going into the playoffs you’re going to have to scramble, period. But you want everybody healthy, you want everybody there. “(This) would not be the first thing I would want to happen, but I do feel comfortable with the options that we’re looking at.” East Duplin has advanced to at least the second round every year going back to at least 2006 while Northeastern has been strong for years, advancing to the third round the last three years after finishing as state runner-up in 2010 and 2011. And in 2009 East Duplin beat the Eagles 3-2 to advance to the regional semifinals. Dixon-North Pitt While her girls are the lower seed, Dixon coach Heather Moore crunched the numbers and liked what they told her. North Pitt is seeded No. 11, which is between Croatan and East Duplin – two teams the Bulldogs played twice each this season. “That’s within our capability of playing like we can do,” she said. “We’ll prepare for a big hitting team and be ready to play.” While Dixon lost twice to East Duplin 3-0 and once to Croatan 3-0, the Bulldogs took the Cougars to five sets in their other loss, which gave Moore reason for optimism heading into the playoffs. “We played fine with Croatan the first time, so we’re capable,” she said. “It’s not going to be easy..., but we have the potential to win. We just need to come out and play.” Dixon lost 3-0 at Croatan in its regular-season finale after having won three of its last four. North Pitt also lost its last regular season game, 3-2 at Farmville Central to snap a six-game winning streak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:32:14.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
