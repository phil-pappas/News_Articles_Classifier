Grizzlies lose to Weber State in OT, 24-21 0 Evan Frost @efrostee \nMontana quarterback Chad Chalich is tackled by Weber State safety Josh Burton in the second quarter of Montana's 24-21 loss at Washington Grizzly Stadium on Oct. 10, 2015. Chalich left the game prior to halftime with an injury and was replaced by Makena Simis. \nThe Montana Grizzlies had already seen their starting quarterback go down with an injury this season. \nThey had already lost one game on a last-second field goal. \nToday, the Grizzlies got to experience both of those sinking feelings again. \nFirst, Chad Chalich, filling in at quarterback for the injured Brady Gustafson, got hurt just before halftime. \nThen, Weber State kicker Josh Kealamakia nailed a 27-yard field goal in overtime to send the Grizzlies to a 24-21 loss in front of 25,500 on a beautiful fall day at Washington-Grizzly Stadium. \n“I feel horrible for our players,” said Montana coach Bob Stitt, facing the media 40 minutes after Kealamakia’s kick gave the Grizzlies their first conference loss. “As a coach, you feel like a parent and you want to help them and when it doesn’t go their way it’s heart-wrenching that you can’t help them be successful when they’re giving you everything they’ve got.” \nThe Grizzlies came into the game on a two-game win streak and a much longer streak against Weber State at home. \nThe Wildcats hadn’t beaten Montana the last 14 times the two teams played at Washington-Grizzly, a streak that stretched back 28 years to 1987. \nWeber came out of the gate firing in this one, though, forcing a three-and-out on Montana’s first possession and then scoring four plays later when Eric Wilkes walked in untouched from three yards out. \nWilkes led all rushers with 24 carries for 112 yards in the game. \nThe Grizzlies answered back quickly though, with Chalich leading touchdown drives of 75 and 64 yards to give Montana a 14-7 lead in the first quarter. \nBen Roberts caught the first touchdown, a four-yard throw from Chalich, before John Nguyen ran in the second one, also from four yards out. \nThe Wildcats struck back to tie the game in the second quarter when quarterback Jadrian Clark found wide receiver Cam Livingston on a crossing pattern for a 15-yard touchdown. \nThey then took the lead when Chalich threw behind Roberts and Weber State safety Cordero Dixon picked off the pass and took it 30 yards to the house, making the score 21-14 at halftime. \nChalich was injured on the Grizzlies’ last offensive play before the break and wouldn’t return to the game, meaning that Montana had to rely on sophomore Makena Simis, the third-string quarterback when the season opened. \n“We tried to keep it simple and understand what they were trying to do and take shots when we needed to and hand the ball off when we needed to,” said Stitt about how the gameplan changed when Simis came in. \nMontana’s defense shut the Wildcats out in the second half, and with time ticking down in the fourth quarter, Simis led the Grizzlies on a six-play, 95-yard drive to tie the game at 21. \nThe drive was capped off with a 44-yard touchdown throw from Simis to Ben Roberts. \n“Really they were scared of (wide receiver) Jamaal (Jones) taking them deep so we had Ben wide open down the middle and it was an easy throw, I just had to hit him,” Simis said after the game. \nRoberts finished with eight catches for 115 and two touchdowns for Montana. \nThe Wildcats had one last chance to win the game in regulation when running back Cory Thomson got out of bounds with one second left on the clock, but Kealamakia pushed the ensuing 51-yard field goal wide right, sending the game to overtime. \nWeber State won the coin toss before overtime and elected to make Montana go on offense first, a decision that paid off on the very first play of the extra period when Simis was hit in the pocket by defensive Tre’von Johnson and fumbled. \nThe Wildcats recovered the ball, which left them starting on the Montana 25-yard line, needing just a field goal to win the game. \nAfter three rushes by Thomson got the ball to the Montana 9, Clark kneeled the ball in the middle of the field to set up Kealamakia’s chance at redemption. \nThis time, he drilled the kick with no hesitation, dropping the Grizzlies to 3-3 on the season. \n“If I had my way I would have drawn it up just like this,” said Weber State coach Jay Hill. “Our team needed to battle and fight and claw and dig and come out top. That’s something we did last year, we battled and it seemed like we came up on the short end of things…so that’s the kind of win we needed.” \nThe loss leaves Montana at 3-3 overall on the year, and 2-1 in-conference. With more injury questions up in the air for the Grizzlies and a couple of heartbreaking losses on the season, you have to wonder how Stitt and company will respond to this type of adversity. \nThe Griz sit at fifth place in-conference after the Weber game, and they will have a Saturday off before taking on North Dakota in Washington-Grizzly Stadium on the 24th. \nandrew.houghton@umontana.edu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:06:16.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
