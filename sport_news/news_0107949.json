They are all are very ambitious, obviously. \n\"All of those teams, and we saw it, were capable of getting into a semi-final, maybe even a final, so I think they will do their own individual reviews and find their own reasons for why they didn't go as far as their ambitions would like to take them. \n\"Whether that impacts the global season is another issue, but we are in conversations about the global season to see if it can be improved, to see if it can find a better balance than it currently has. \n\"It's not an easy process, and it's not easy to find the reconciliation of all interests, but we are trying to do that.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:51.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
