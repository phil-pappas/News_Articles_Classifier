He, however, said the terror infrastructure was intact across the border and terrorists had been kept in various launching pads. “Post the DG-level meeting between the two countries last month, there is peace on the international border and no such activity has been noticed which can arouse our concern. But we are not taking anything lightly as 24x7 vigil is on,” said RK Sharma, Inspector General (IG), BSF, Jammu Frontier. The BSF IG was responding to media queries on All India Police Day and Martyrs Day here this morning. He said the BSF personnel on the ground had been asked to remain alert. “We are carefully examining every activity across the border and will take appropriate action wherever required, but terrorists are still active and have been kept in various launching pads,” said the BSF IG. He said immediately after the DG-level meeting, there was one suspected intrusion attempt. “We had lodged a strong protest with Pakistan, clearly telling them that it went against the mandate of the meeting. We have told them that there should be no movement in the night close to the international border. Barring that incident, no further intrusion bids have occurred,” he said. As winter has started setting in, the IG said the BSF had already shifted into winter posture. In winter, when snow closes mountain passes on the rugged and hilly terrain of the Line of Control, Pakistani militants shift their focus to the international border, largely a plain area. “The BSF has put in place a winter strategy. It’s also a festive season in Jammu. We have beefed up security, including deployment of more men and additional surveillance gadgets. Every inch of the border is under strict vigil,” he said. To a specific query on a group of militants being taught ‘Gurmukhi’ opposite the Hiranagar and Bamiyal areas by the ISI so as to avoid their detection once pushed into the Indian side, the IG said such inputs were also available with the BSF. “The BSF and other sister agencies are looking into it minutely. If we come across such suspects, apt and swift action will be taken, but we never lower our guard on the international border,” added Sharma.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:04:55.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
