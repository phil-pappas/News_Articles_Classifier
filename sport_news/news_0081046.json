The Seminoles' offense isn't as dynamic as they have been in years past and has relied mostly on running back Dalvin Cook. However the sophomore, who leads the ACC in rushing with 570 yards, has missed most of this week's practice after straining his left hamstring in last Saturday's 24-16 win at Wake Forest. Miami is coming off a 34-23 loss at Cincinnati on Oct. 1. Under Al Golden, the Hurricanes are 15-5 in August/September games but 16-18 once the calendar turns to October. \nKEY MATCHUP \nFlorida State junior WR Bobo Wilson against Miami senior S Deon Bush. They are former teammates at Miami's Christopher Columbus High School. Wilson has emerged as the Seminoles' top receiver and had a 51-yard reception last week at Wake Forest. Bush is one of the Hurricanes' most physical defenders and has an interception. Wilson is looking to get back at Bush after a hard hit in last year's game. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nMiami: RB Joseph Yearby is averaging 7.31 yards per carry, which is ninth in FBS. The sophomore has three straight 100-yard rushing games and had 243 all-purpose yards earlier in the season against Florida Atlantic. \nFlorida State: QB Everett Golson threw for 202 yards against Wake Forest, which was his first 200-yard game since the opener against Texas State. He is completing 64.2 percent of his passes and has not committed a turnover. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nMiami leads the ACC in turnover margin (plus-9) and is ranked second nationally. ... Hurricanes QB Brad Kaaya has thrown just four interceptions in his last 342 attempts. The sophomore threw for 316 yards last year which is one of his five 300-yard games. ... Florida State has a 26-game winning streak in ACC games. ... The Seminoles are sixth in the nation in scoring defense (11.5), eighth in passing yards allowed (141) and 13th in total defense (281.5). ... Florida State is the only team in the nation that has not committed an offensive turnover. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:35:29.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
