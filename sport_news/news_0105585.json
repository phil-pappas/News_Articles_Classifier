We don't want ISIS to run Syria, do we? It should be a civilised and legitimate government. This is what we need to discuss,\" Medvedev said, using another name for the Islamic State.\nAsked whether Syria had to be ruled by Assad, Medvedev said: \"No, absolutely not. It is up to the Syrian people to decide who will be the head of Syria.... At the moment, we operate on the premise that al-Assad is the legitimate president.\"\nThe U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday there was no meeting of the minds with Russia's President Vladimir Putin over the continuing rule of Assad, and that the Syrian civil war could only end with a political solution leading to a new inclusive government.\nAccording to Russia, its air force has made 669 sorties, hitting 456 targets in Syria, since the start of the operation on Sept. 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:07:41.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
