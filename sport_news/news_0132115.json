Now it wants those notices to be included in the ongoing discussions under the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP). Officials from India and Finland would meet soon to decide on the course of action,” the official told PTI.\nWhen contacted, the telecom company said: “Nokia has indeed received a claim from the tax authorities – it is largely about the same dispute as earlier, so we have nothing to add.”\nThe government has been emphasising on early resolution of pending tax disputes with a view to make the tax regime more predictable and investor friendly.\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley had last month said: “The resolution can be by way of judicial tribunals, by way of discussions within or by way of some other methods that we have used in other cases.\n“... it is necessary to resolve these issues as tax uncertainty does not help the investment environment and therefore, we want the entire instability over the taxation matters to be expeditiously resolved”.\nMAP is an alternative available to taxpayers for resolving disputes involving double taxation. However, there is no time frame for resolving cases under MAP negotiations. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:51:19.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
