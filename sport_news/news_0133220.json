Arsenal, meanwhile, suffered its second embarrassing loss of the campaign. \nWith no points after two matches, Arsenal are bottom of Group F, led by German champions Bayern Munich with six points. Bayern pounded Croatian Dinamo Zagreb 5-0 on Tuesday. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:42:34.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
