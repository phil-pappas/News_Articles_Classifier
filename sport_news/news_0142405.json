PETERSONAP Sports Writer \nEUGENE, Ore. (AP) - Luke Falk threw for season-high 505 yards and five touchdowns, including an unusual scoring pass in the second overtime, and Washington State snapped an eight-game losing streak to Oregon with a 45-38 victory in overtime over the Ducks on Saturday. \nKnotted at 38, an unnecessary roughness foul on the Ducks helped the Cougars in the second OT, and then Falk appeared to hit River Cracraft with a pass that landed in the hands of Robert Lewis for a 4-yard touchdown. \nThe play withstood review, and Oregon's subsequent drive ended in an interception - sending the Cougars rushing onto the field in celebration. \nFalk had marched Washington State (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12) downfield in the final two minutes of regulation, capping the drive with an 8-yard pass to tie the game at 31 and send it to overtime. \nJeff Lockie hit Bralon Addison with a 9-yard touchdown pass for the Ducks (3-3, 1-2) on the opening possession of the extra period. The Cougars answered with Falk's close 1-yard keeper that withstood a review that again tied the score. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
