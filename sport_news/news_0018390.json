Next up is Arkansas on the road, and Brandon Allen may not have to throw a pass except the Auburn defense is far too inviting far too often. Kentucky inexplicably went away from tailback Boom Williams , who carried only 16 times despite averaging 7.1 yards a tote and busting a 60-yarder. \nBret Bielema, who's taking Saturday off to prepare, will turn the Auburn game into his Super Bowl. If you thought he was excited after getting a call against Alabama, imagine what his level of glee would be after getting a win over Malzahn. \nAuburn's schedule gets even more challenging from there. \nFor one night at least, the Tigers were able to generate their own enthusiasm and overcome their own flaws and win a conference game on the road. Not everyone believed they were capable of pulling that off. \nSo the team that needed something good to happen made it happen. That's worth at least 24 hours of a frown turned upside down. \nThat's my take. What's yours?
