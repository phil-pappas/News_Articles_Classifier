An OU win would mean Abbott will send a shipment of meals from Railhead BBQ in Fort Worth to the City Rescue Mission, an Oklahoma City nonprofit partnering with the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:03:59.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
