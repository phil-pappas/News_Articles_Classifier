For a half, the Cyclones looked as though they would keep things within striking distance of a Big 12 frontrunner. \nThen it all came crashing down around them. \nTCU stifled an early upset bid by shutting down the Cyclones’ offense to make its way to a 45-21 win Saturday night at Jack Trice Stadium. \nThe Cyclones (2-4, 1-2) dropped their second consecutive game despite a 21-point, 262-yard first-quarter outburst that saw them take two separate leads against the Horned Frogs (7-0, 4-0). ISU followed that with zero points in the final 46 minutes, 49 seconds of the game and just 199 yards of total offense following the first quarter. \nAllen Lazard caught five passes for 147 yards and one touchdown while quarterback Sam Richardson was 22 of 36 for 251 yards. Mike Warren’s run of 100-yard rushing games came to an end with 78 yards on 22 carries. \nTCU Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback Trevone Boykin completed 27 of 32 passes for 436 yards and four touchdowns while also rushing for 74 yards and a score. Receiver Josh Doctson had 10 receptions for 190 yards and two scores while Kolby Listenbee had six catches for 101 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Cyclones allowed 621 yards of total offense to the Frogs a week after surrendering 776 in a loss to Texas Tech. \nISU travels to Waco next week to face undefeated and second-ranked Baylor on Saturday.
