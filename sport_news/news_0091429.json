(AP) - A district court judge has ruled that state attorneys must testify about how the decision was reached to cancel a nearly $200 million Medicaid contract.\nThe Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1G5zttz ) Judge Tim Kelley made the ruling Tuesday after Client Network Services Inc. sought to depose layers from the Jindal administration as well as state assistant attorneys general.\nCNSI attorney Michael McKay says they want to know more about events and discussions that led up to the decision.\nCommissioner of Administration Kristy Nichols previously testified she canceled the contract based on the advice of counsel. McKay said there was no other way to get additional information about the decision than to go to the lawyers.\nMcKay says Nichols' testimony opens to door for lawyers to be deposed.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
