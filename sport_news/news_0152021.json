The Royals right-hander combined with three relievers on a three-hitter, Salvador Perez hit a soaring home run off Toronto starter Marco Estrada, and Kansas City rolled to a 5-0 victory in Game 1 of their American League Championship Series. Volquez (1-1) ramped up his fastball to 97 mph to slice through a potent Blue Jays offense, never allowing a runner past second base over six innings. His only trouble occurred when he walked the first two batters in the sixth, but he wiggled out of it without any damage. The Royals’ bullpen finished off the club’s eighth consecutive ALCS victory. NBA Spokeswoman for Odom’s aunt says he woke up LAS VEGAS – Lamar Odom regained consciousness, speaking and even offering a thumbs-up from his hospital bed, just days after being found in extremely critical condition at a Nevada brothel. It serves as the first significant update to Odom’s health since he was found unconscious and facedown at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada, Tuesday afternoon. NFL Police: Manziel in domestic dispute involving alcohol CLEVELAND – Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel was involved in a domestic dispute with his girlfriend this week that police say involved alcohol. Manziel was pulled over by Avon, Ohio, police after a witness said a person was trying to jump from the quarterback’s speeding vehicle. Manziel admitted drinking before the incident, but police didn’t charge him. Manziel spent 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehab facility during the offseason for treatment of an unspecified condition. The Browns said they are aware of the incident. Skiing U.S. star Miller will skip 2015-16 World Cup circuit Bode Miller will take a break from racing on the World Cup circuit this season to spend more time with his family, test out new ski equipment and help train a barn of horses he bought. The six-time Olympic medalist isn’t leaning toward retirement just yet, but he did say Thursday that competing at the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea was, “really unlikely.” The U.S. skier turned 38 earlier this week. Fitness-wise, Miller said he “feels excellent.” He had surgery last November to fix a herniated disk in his back and didn’t return until the world championships three months later in Beaver Creek. He crashed during the super-G and severed his right hamstring tendon. 4-time Olympic skier skips season to have baby ANCHORAGE, Alaska – A four-time Olympian and one of the most decorated American cross-county skiers is taking off this season to have a baby. World champion skier Kikkan Randall and her husband, Jeff Ellis, of Anchorage, Alaska, announced they are expecting their first child in April. The 32-year-old Randall said in a release that she and Ellis thought this was a good time to start a family. She plans to skip this year but compete in 2016-17.

She has three World Cup titles and two World Championship medals, including gold in team sprint in 2013 with Jessie Diggins of Afton, Minnesota.
