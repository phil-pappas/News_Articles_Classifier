When the bank failed in 1891, U.S. Marshals arrested French at this Comm. Ave. home and a federal court indicted him for allegedly embezzling nearly a million dollars from the bank. Photo courtesy of Brian McWilliams It's not clear why, but French was never convicted. However, to pay his creditors, French lost all his holdings, including No. 128 and all its furniture. Photo courtesy of Brian McWilliams Charles Bond, the subsequent owner of #128, arguably fared even worse. Bond was the president of one of the biggest cigar companies in the country and had numerous real estate holdings in Washington, D.C. After buying #128 in 1894, Bond fell in love with #130, too. Bond acquired #130 in 1908 and knocked out some of the walls to join the \"sisters\" into one mega-mansion. Photo courtesy of Brian McWilliams Thanks in part to the Panic of 1907—in which stock prices plummeted and depositors made a run on the banks—Bond was overextended when he bought #130. In May 1908, a trustee took over all of Bond's holdings, which included the Lyric Theater (later the Shubert Theater). Photo courtesy of Brian McWilliams On July 3, 1908, Bond was found dead in a half-filled bathtub at his summer home in Swampscott. Reportedly, a suicide note was found nearby, in which Bond blamed his ruin on both \"friends and enemies.\" Photo courtesy of Brian McWilliams Bond's wife, Isabella, had the walls restored between the two sisters, and then sold #130. Isabella lived in #128 until her death in 1931, after which her family leased the house to various tenants. In 2012, #128 sold for $8.75 million. This past March, #130 sold for $11.6 million.
