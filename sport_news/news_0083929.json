An arrest warrant was pending against the Congress leader in Jamshedpur since April.\nBhuiyan's colleague Ganesh Shankar Vidayarthi told TOI, \"He (Bhuiyan) was sent to jail from the court premises in the evening. The court has sent him to judicial custody till November 6.\"\nThe CBI lodged a disproportionate assets case RC 21 (A) against Bhuiyan in 2013 according to the directions of the Jharkhand high court. The high court had given the instructions to the CBI following a writ petition filed against him. The case was lodged under different sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act) by CBI.\nBhuiyan faces charges of having assets worth over Rs one crore disproportionate to known sources of his income. He has acquired movable and immovable property worth Rs 1.3 crore between 2005 and 2013, said Durga Oraon, a local anti-corruption crusader who moved the high court against Bhuiya demanding a probe into his assets.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-27T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:52:53.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
