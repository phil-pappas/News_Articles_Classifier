A few weeks ago, the Bassmaster Angler of the Year was announced. \nAaron Martens, of Leeds Alabama, secured his third AOY title. For those that have ever paid an entry fee and fished competitively, this title means a lot. \nMany years ago, on the famous Missouri impoundment, Lake of the Ozarks, a seasoned veteran of the bass wars told me, “All you have to do to win Angler of the Year is catch ten pounds a day.” \nConsidering most tournaments run a five-fish limit, boating a two-pound average didn’t sound all that challenging. \nThen this pro continued, “Keep in mind, if you only catch eight one day, that means you need to catch twelve the next.” \nThen it hit me. What a daunting task. The Angler of the Year title is not about one really good event. \nIt is about consistency throughout the entire season. It is the same in every sport, the best perform week in and week out. \nNo matter the weather. No matter the situation. They find a way to have a strong showing. \nThat doesn’t mean Martens had to win every event. It just meant he needed to stay near the top to accrue the needed points to secure the title. His finishes for the 2015 season went as follows: third, 66th, second, first, 15th, 13th, first, sixth. \nAs you can see, there was only one event where he didn’t finish near the top. \nAdd in the fact that these tournaments take place against some of the best anglers in the world and the gravity of the title sinks in. \nMark Davis, another former Angler of the Year winner, told me winning that title meant more to him then securing the coveted Bassmaster Classic champion. He reiterated the fact that to win the Classic, you just need to have one good tournament. But to win the Angler of the Year meant he had to be nearly perfect throughout the entire season. Consistency is the key. \nIn an article on Bassfan.com, Martens talked about how you need to have everything go just right to win that title. \nYou can’t have any major mechanical issues, you can’t have the giant kicker fish come unhooked at the side of the boat, you can’t have your line break at a critical moment. \nAll of these unknowns need to work in your favor. \nBut it’s not just luck. Preparation puts you in a situation to seem lucky. \nPart of the preparation involves being physically fit. Marten’s mentions in the article that he runs a lot during the offseason. \nHis endurance level needs to be at its peak in order to battle through the long and grueling days fighting the elements and focusing on catching the next fish. \nEven for those who only fish recreationally, there are times when we find ourselves just going through the motions on the water and not staying focused on the little things. \nThe result is often a missed fish when the bite occurs. AOY champions can’t lapse from their mental game. \nYes, we love our sports in this country. There is something about rising up above the crowd that we can all admire. \nAs Aaron Martens enjoys his current success, those that finished below him are no doubt thinking about the 2016 season. They too are preparing and working towards becoming the next champion. \n• Steve Rogers can be reached at salcrogers@comcast.net.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:38:31.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
