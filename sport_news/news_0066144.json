(Stephen Mally/The Gazette) Most Popular The Gazette October 24, 2015 | 11:30 pm \nPutting one in the win column was a major lift for No. 22 Northern Iowa, which upset No. 6 South Dakota State, 10-7, on Saturday afternoon at Coughlin-Alumni Stadium in Brookings, S.D. \nThe win ended a 3-game losing streak for the Panthers (3-4, 1-3 MVFC) and kept them in the hunt for a playoff spot at the end of the season. \nNeither team was able to get much going until the Panthers drove 92 yards for a 24-yard field goal by Michael Schmadeke right before halftime. \nThe Jackrabbits (5-2, 2-2) took the lead in the third quarter on a 6-yard pass from Taryn Christion to Connor Landberg, but the Panthers responded with a 35-yard TD run by quarterback Aaron Bailey on their next possession. \nBailey started the game and finished with a team-high 169 rushing yards to go with 113 yards passing. Tyvis Smith had 54 rushing yards on 12 carries. \nUNI was tough on defense, piling up five sacks — three by defensive tackle Karter Schult — and 12 tackles for loss. \nSDSU had just 95 yards rushing on 37 attempts. \nThe Jackrabbits had the ball at the UNI 11-yard line with 1:31 remaining, but the Panthers got the stop on fourth-and-one to preserve the win. It was UNI’s 19th win over a top 10 team since 2001.
