The sleek GT-7 TM detector, with its powerful Digital Signal Processing (DSP) microprocessor, GPS-location based alerts and patented long-range detection, alerts drivers to potential threats earlier and faster for enhanced ticket protection. Complete with copper-tone molding, the ground-breaknig design offers exceptional range for longer alert warnings and mirrors Beltronics’ raw, athletic capabilities. “Beltronics is the ideal brand for assertive drivers who want to be able to set their own limits,” says Sally Washlow, President. “Our rugged new brand look and the extreme capabilities of the GT-7 give drivers everything they need to take back the road.”\nThe GT-7’s three driving modes and customizable speed-based sensitivity digitally isolate real signals from false alerts, like automatic door openers and motion sensors, and automatically eliminates them for a personalized, trouble-free experience.\nThe GT-7’s proprietary DEFENDER Database provides users access to the geographic locations of surrounding red light and speed cameras and is continuously updated as traps are added, or removed, keeping drivers confident and informed.\nThe GT-7’s high-res graphic display shows the type, strength and quantity of signals. Additionally, the GT-7 is compatible with the social ticket protection app Escort Live!TM combining the power of consumer generated reporting with verified data to identify red light and speed cameras, police speed traps and air patrol monitoring as well as real-time speed limit information. Clear voice alerts in both English and Spanish allow drivers to keep their focus on the road.\nThe GT-7 is priced at $499.95 and comes with everything drivers need – a SmartCord for extended reach and convenient alert control access, strong-hold StickyCupTM for quick installation and a handy travel case.\nFor details or more information on Beltronics’ complete line of premium automotive products, visit Beltronics.com or call (800) 433-3487.\nAbout Beltronics\nBeltronics is a major brand of Cedar Electronics, a leading, global supplier of mobile and consumer electronics products.
