But will they be better? This is a big season for a team that’s hoping to take the next step in the playoffs.\nAdChoices What’s different this season? The loss of Paul Pierce is a bigger individual loss than any one gain from any of the additions Washington made. Nonetheless, the Wizards signed Alan Anderson and Gary Neal to one-year deals and traded for Jared Dudley. In the draft, it made a trade with the Atlanta Hawks to get the rights to Kelly Oubre, a supremely athletic 6-7 small forward out of Kansas who is not expected to make a big contribution immediately.\nHow good can they be? John Wall and Bradley Beal scored fewer points a game last year than in the 2013-14 season, but both players were more efficient. At 25 and 22, respectively, neither has played his best basketball. And with better depth on the wings because of Dudley, Anderson, Neal and Oubre, the Wizards should be a threat to make it to the Eastern Conference finals.\nHow far do they have to go? Washington was sixth in the NBA in shooting at 46.2%, and its defensive rating of 100.0 was fifth best in the NBA and second best in the East. The team also was in the top 10 in three-point shooting percentage, rebounding and assists.\nRight way to rebuild? The Wizards shot 36% on three-pointers, but no team in the East attempted fewer. That should change with Washington’s free agency additions and players such as Kris Humphries and Kevin Seraphin no longer on the team. Consequently, the Wizards should be smaller, faster and ultimately shoot more threes and score more than 15.2 points a game off turnovers.\nIs Otto Porter ready? After starting 13regular-season games last year, Porter will take over as the starter for departed Pierce. Porter, 22, showed signs of progress in that he scored in double digits in five of the Wizards’ 10 playoff games. The third pick overall in the 2013 NBA draft has great length at 6-8 and is developing a three-point shot that was at 33.7% last year.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:38:36.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
