Dixon thriving in his senior season at Bryant University 1 / 3 Back to Gallery \nIt didn’t take long for Danbury’s Aaron Dixon to be inserted into the Bryant University football team’s starting lineup. \nThree games into his freshman year to be exact. \n“He proved to us in camp that he had the ability to learn our defensive scheme and be a consistent player for us,” Bryant head coach Marty Fine said. “He played a lot on special teams and his athleticism gave us the confidence to use him at linebacker as well.” \nNow a senior, Dixon has become an integral part of the Bulldogs defense and is a big reason for the program’s improvements. \nCaptain Dixon \nPerhaps making the distinction of captain all the more gratifying is the fact that Dixon was elected a captain by his teammates. \n“It felt real good to know that my teammates around me look up to me and respect me as a person and a player,” said Dixon, who was an All-FCIAC linebacker at Danbury High School . “It felt like everything just kind of gelled together.” \nThe Bryant coaching staff wholly endorsed the Bulldogs’ selection. \n“His ability to lead on the field has improved a lot,” Fine said. “He has played around some outstanding leaders on our defense and he has become a really sound and respected leader of our football team.” \nAnd Dixon has held up his end of the bargain through the team’s first four games, posting 24 tackles. He also picked off a pass and returned it 47 yards for a touchdown in the season-opening 27-3 win over American International. \n“I used to say ‘you’re a sheep and you’re going to turn into a lion someday’ and he’s finally turned into a lion,” Bryant defensive coordinator Greg Gigantino said. “He’s steady and he does his job and makes big plays.” \nOn a two-game losing streak, Bryant currently sits at 2-2, and going out a winner is way more of a focus than individual accolades for the senior. \n“Knowing that this is my last year adds a little extra significance to it,” Dixon said. “My class and the rest of the people at Bryant are all trying to leave the school in better position than we stepped into. We’re trying to build foundation for next program to become a better program.” \nHelping Bryant get better \nDixon was second on the team with 61 tackles as a freshman and also notched 45 tackles as a sophomore, but the wins weren’t coming, as the Bulldogs went just 9-14 in those two years combined. \nIn his junior season one year ago, Dixon and company enjoyed a dramatic turnaround, posting a record of 8-3. \n“Last year when we knocked off Stony Brook and Maine (were the two best wins so far in college),” Dixon said. “It got us in the top-25 and they had thousands of fans at Stony Brook. It was something special. Playing high school football you don’t get to experience playing in front of that many people.” \nIt was another exceptional season for Dixon, who posted 43 tackles, two sacks, six tackles for a loss and a fumble recovery. His two sacks keyed a victory over Maine and he was named the NEC Defensive Player of the Week. \n“Aaron played outstanding and did the little things that we asked of him every single game,” Fine said. “We ask our players to do their job to the best of their ability and Aaron did that for us.” \nBiggest improvement \nBoth Dixon and Gigantino believe Dixon has grown by leaps and bounds with the mental aspect of the game. \n“There’s no substitute for experience,” Gigantino said. “Every little aspect of his game has gotten better, especially the mental side. His confidence has improved every season.” \nAdmittedly, Dixon simply roamed the field looking to hit anything that moved when he was a freshman. \n“When I was a freshman, I just went out and played football running around trying to make tackles,” said Dixon, whose father played college football at Iona. \nIn the years that have followed, Dixon has become much more cerebral. \n“Now that I’ve matured, I’m able to read offenses and understand where I need to be based on formations and alignments,” Dixon said. “I’m a lot more detail-oriented.” \nVillanova, Towson, Temple and Albany also recruited Dixon, but the accounting major picked Bryant for the strong combination of academics and athletics. \n“I thought about my career outside of football,” Dixon said. “I wanted to be set up with a good job right out of school, and I thought Bryant provided me with that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:45:34.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
