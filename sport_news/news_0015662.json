The bruising back dominated all but one play turned in by his quarterback. \nFacing a third-and-six from the Aggie 24 in the fourth quarter, Jake Coker rolled to the left before scrambling to the right. His 16-yard run ended with a vicious blow delivered to Aggie cornerback Nick Harvey at the 8-yard line. \nInstead of forcing a ball into traffic or throwing it away, Coker made a play with his feet. \n\"I was rolling right and we were (trying) to throw the ball over there,\" Coker said, \"but they did a good job of kinda making it cloudy over there. And in that time of the game, I was going to take any chances, so I did what I could.\" \nIt spoke to Coker's philosophy when it's time to tuck and run. \n\"I don't like sliding,\" he said. \"I think it's kinda crazy, especially you get close and somebody gets close and you start sliding and they want to get one in on you. I don't believe in sliding.\" \nAfter Henry's career-high 236 rushing yards, Coker was next on the stat sheet. His 13 net yards on seven attempts bettered Kenyan Drake's five for 11 yards. Coker gained a total of 30, but lost 17 on plays ending behind the line.
