UC, the top team in Class 2A, boasts arguably the best backfield on the First Coast with Hussien Howe and Otis Anderson Jr. The two have combined for almost 1,500 rushing yards and 26 rushing touchdowns through just six games. \nCedar Creek has confidence though. The Saints are riding a five-game winning streak, the longest in school history, and they believe they have what it takes to defeat the Christians. \nThere will be plenty of action in this one but if this game doesn't do it for you have no fear because the First Coast Sports team will have our cameras all throughout the First Coast catching all of the action. \nDon't forget to turn into Sideline 2015, Friday night at 11:15 p.m. on FCN. High school sports guru Justin Barney breaks down the Sideline 2015 Week 8 Games to Watch.
