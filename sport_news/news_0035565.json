A week later, Fells’ wife took him to the emergency room with a 104-degree fever. It was then determined that his ankle was infected with MRSA, a staph infection that’s dangerous because it’s resistant to many antibiotics. \n\"We are concerned about Daniel Fells. We’re very concerned about that,\" coach Tom Coughlin said last week. \"We still do not know the reason for the infection or where it came from.\" \nFells sent out a pregame message to his teammates via Instagram that said: \"My heart is with my brothers tonight. Get that W G-men. I love every one of you. #thiswillnotdefeatme.’’ \nBased on a directive from the NFL and the NFL Players Association, the Giants are debriefing their players about what the team is doing to ensure their safety. Team physicians, senior vice president of medical services Ronnie Barnes and the supervisor in charge of cleaning the team facility offered an update on what’s being done to prevent the spread of the infection. \nThe facility’s entire first floor, including the locker room, meeting rooms and trainer’s room, was scrubbed and cleaned. Players also were alerted to watch for any warning signs that their health might be compromised. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:28:24.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
