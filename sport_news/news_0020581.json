His dad, Jerome, was working multiple jobs — postman, limo driver, furniture deliveryman — and they simply couldn’t afford tickets. \nBut father and son watched the games together and when Joe Carter’s home run sailed over the left-field wall, Jerome packed his son in the car and drove down the street with seven-year-old Drew in charge of honking the horn in celebration. \n“I couldn’t figure out why we weren’t allowed to do that after every game (next year),” Clement, now 29, said of his childhood logic of the Blue Jays World Series win. “I just expected that we always won and that’s how baseball worked.” \nBut baseball, especially in Toronto, did not work that way. We know how the story goes: No playoffs, no celebratory honking for 22 years for fans of the Blue Jays. \nIf you’re of a certain age now — mostly the 20-something, millennial generation — those heroes of 1992 and 1993 were playing before your brain was ready to form lasting memories. But perhaps you feel tangentially related to the glory years. \nMaybe you’re like Clement, who recalls his World Series car ride because he’s been told the tale by his father, but was too young to know he should store those visions for a later date. \nOr maybe you’re like Kristie Nairn, who is a 28-year-old self-described “borderline super fan” now and vaguely remembers being stirred from sleep as a child by her mother the night Joe touched ’em all. It was a time to celebrate, even if she didn’t understand exactly what all the excitement was about. \nOr maybe you were in diapers then, so after years of Blue Jays’ mediocrity you sought comfort in those old MLB commemorative VHS tapes — they had the gold block lettering on the cover, you know the ones — that recapped the road to the top of the baseball world. Eric Hartman, 25, gathered with friends during his first year of university a few years back, popped in those videos and travelled back in time. \n“We watched them blow the triple-play call and just started screaming as if it’d been blown in real time,” he said of Game 3 of the 1992 World Series, referencing the play in which Jays third baseman Kelly Gruber lunged at — and missed, according to the umpire — the foot of the Braves’ Deion Sanders to complete what would have been an unlikely post-season triple play. \nTwenty-two lean years followed the back-to-back championships and fans like Clement, Nairn and Hartman grew up in the shadow of the mythical figures of the early ’90s; they knew and respected the legends that had been passed down, but craved the chance to witness history of their own. \n“Our generation, people our age, have just been living in someone else’s memory. We’ve been talking, watching, discussing, hoping and holding onto our parents’ memories, and we never had one of our own,” Clement said. \nUntil now. Until Game 5 of the American League Division Series versus the Texas Rangers — the bottom of the seventh inning, following the debacle of the top. Until, with one swing, long-time Blue Jay Jose Bautista obliterated that ball, propelled himself to the stratosphere of Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar and gave so many fans that lasting highlight they’d been waiting for. \n“To have this finally is just — it’s beyond words. This is something we’re going to be talking about for the rest of our lives. And I think even if they go on to win the whole thing and there’s other moments, I still think this is a defining moment,” Nairn said. \nThere are obvious reasons why this post-season for long-time fans from the millennial generation is so special. For one, it’s their first taste of October baseball involving their hometown team. But more importantly, there is a familiarity with this club’s characters. \nThey know that Kevin Pillar prowls the outfield with a complete disregard for his body; they know that slugger Edwin Encarnacion prefers to let his bat do the talking; and they know that Bautista played 1,403 games without a post-season appearance, and that if anyone deserves a bat flip with flare, it’s him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:30:47.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
