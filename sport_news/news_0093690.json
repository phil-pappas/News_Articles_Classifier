WALKERAP Pro Football Writer \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - An MRI exam shows Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota sprained his left MCL, and coach Ken Whisenhunt says they will have to see how the rookie's knee progresses before determining if he can play Sunday against Atlanta. \nWhisenhunt said that Mariota was walking around just fine at the Tennessee headquarters on Monday. \nMariota was injured during the second quarter of Sunday's 38-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins when hit low by end Olivier Vernon. The rookie stayed on the field and didn't miss a play. Mariota did put a brace after the series, and he remained in the game until Whisenhunt sent Zach Mettenberger in for the final series with 1:54 left. \nOnline: \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nFollow Teresa M.
