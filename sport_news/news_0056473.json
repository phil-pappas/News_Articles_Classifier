He finished with 142 yards in 25 attempts after having a modest 25 yards at halftime \n“Ernest Grant gives this team a boost,” Boyter said. “He has worked so hard. He has the discipline to get the job done. \n“He had a very good night, but I also have to give credit to the guys in the trenches. Yes, Grant runs hard, but he needs some holes to run through and our line did that tonight. We are making strides. Our quarterback [Wisneski] is progressing, and tonight he made some very good decisions. We had no turnovers.” \nBoyter said he was proud of the way his team stayed in the game and was able to come back and score at the end. \n“We did not quit,” he said. “But at times, we had some lapses of who was to play where, what are my duties and responsibilities? The effort was there and that is why I love coaching these kids. They are giving it their all on the field, they are invested in each other and they are invested as a team. That means a lot.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:45:19.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
