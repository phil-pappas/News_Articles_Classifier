The Crimson Tide is favored by more than two touchdowns this Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa. \nWe must be doing something right because Joe vs. the Pro is getting its own headline this week... \nWhile covering the LSU vs. Florida game last weekend, I had a little side assignment from my fearless leader to track down Tom Cruise. \nMission impossible? \nMore like mission accomplished. \nUsing my keen reporter skills, I located the actor (OK, not hard, in the suite next to the press box) and proceeded to lurk by the coffee machine while the fourth quarter played out on the field. LSU scored its go-ahead touchdown on a fake field goal with about 10 minutes to go, so I knew Cruise would be cutting out early like the stealth international spy we've all seen in the movies. \nOnce again, my instincts as a journalist to eat free food in press boxes paid off. I had an exclusive with Cruise. He walked out of the athletic director's suite, I was the only reporter around to shout a question , and he kept right on walking. \nInstead of asking some question about a player Cruise probably didn't even know was on the field (Leonard Fournette), I should have just shouted what every normal person would have shouted in that situation: \"Show me the money!\" \nBecause guess what, friends? I could be making mad stacks of cash predicting these games this season. \n[In the tradition of Joe vs. the Pro, now switching to third person.] \nLike Joe, this little weekly feature is new this season to AL.com. The friendly competition between Joe and the Pro is now in its sixth season overall, though. Joe took a lot of ribbing during all those years at the Miami Herald , and rightly so. The Pro, Lee Sterling of ParamountSports.com , has been killing Joe for years. Joe has always been a terrible picker of college football games. Still is, no doubt, but he's getting lucky. \nObscenely lucky. \nLast week, Joe went 6-2 straight up and 5-3 against the spread to improve this season to 30-18 straight up and a stunning, shining, glittering, resplendent, preposterous, disco-ball shattering 30-16-2 against the spread. Joe did so well (once again) that he even had the luxury of taking a flier on undefeated Texas A&M against Alabama. \nHe's feeling so confident, he might just do it again. \nJust as surprising as Joe's success this season has been the Pro's dry spell. The Pro went 3-5 straight up and 2-6 against the spread last week. He's now 25-22 straight up and 17-29-2 against the spread. Onto the picks! \nClemson at Miami, Clemson by 6.5 \nJoe: Try saying Brent Venables three times fast. Clemson 35, Miami 28 \nPro: The Hurricanes have to hope the empty seats will lull the Tigers into thinking this is just a scrimmage or spring game. If Deshaun Watson is on, then the Canes will not have an answer for the best QB in the ACC. Clemson 31, Miami 21 \nMissouri at Vanderbilt, Missouri by 3 \nJoe: Missouri has trouble getting first downs; Vanderbilt has trouble maintaining possession. Let's call the whole thing off. Missouri 12, Vanderbilt 7 \nPro: Poor decision by the SEC Network to show this game at 3 p.m. when they could have shown the game at 9 p.m. and put most of the viewers to sleep by halftime. If Vandy cuts down on the offensive turnovers they will find a way to win. Vanderbilt 10, Missouri 9 \nUtah at USC, USC by 3.5 \nJoe: Why is the money moving to Southern Cal? Are people drunk betting on these games? Utah 33, USC 29 \nPro: I went back 25 years in my database and couldn't find a top three team as an underdog to an unranked opponent. This game is a trap. The Trojans have a QB in Cody Kessler who can shoot holes in the Utes' defense. The clock strikes midnight. USC 30, Utah 22 \nTennessee at Alabama, Alabama by 15.5 \nJoe: If Tennessee can limit Alabama's defense to one pick-six this thing might be doable. Alabama 35, Tennessee 21 \nPro: Bama is good but they are off some wars and the Vols' offense is balanced and only has five turnovers in six games this year. In its last four games vs. Division-I opponents, the Vols have had games decided by seven, four, one and seven points. Head coach Butch Jones is also 3-1 ATS off of a bye. Alabama 31, Tennessee 24 \nTexas A&M at Ole Miss, Ole Miss by 5.5 \nJoe: It's Kyle Allen vs. Chad Kelly. Four first names, two quarterbacks, one shootout. Ole Miss 55, Texas A&M 45 \nPro: The one glaring weakness of the Aggies is they couldn't stop a decent running back with \"12\" men. Ole Miss isn't into ground and pound, so I expect a shootout with the last team with the ball the winner. Payback for last year's 35-20 loss. Texas A&M 36, Mississippi 34 \nKentucky at Mississippi State, Mississippi State by 11 \nJoe: Why are we picking this game, Pro? Everything here seems boring as hail to me. Dak gets bored, too, and doesn't cover. Mississippi State 21, Kentucky 18 \nPro: State just doesn't beat themselves with only seven turnovers in seven games. State is 12-4-1 ATS as a favorites vs. SEC opponents while the Cats just 6-16-1 ATS as dogs vs. SEC teams. Easy call here! Mississippi State 36, Kentucky 20 \nAuburn at Arkansas, Arkansas by 5.5 \nJoe: The matchup we've all been waiting for: the battle of the SEC's two most overrated teams! Arkansas 25, Auburn 24 \nPro: Sean White played better for the Tigers at QB last week, but he may not be the final answer. They also lack playmakers on defense and can't seem to make a stop when it counts. Arkansas 28, Auburn 20 \nWestern Kentucky at LSU, LSU by 16.5 \nJoe: Western Kentucky has been killing teams in C-USA. Can't wait for UAB to restore order to the force. Trap game for LSU. LSU 42, Western Kentucky 28 \nPro: Hilltoppers give up tons of yards between the 20's, but are ranked No.2 nationally with 19 takeaways. Quarterback Doughty can trade points with anyone as he's racked up 10,082 passing yards and 82 TD passes. Tigers took Syracuse and Eastern Michigan lightly and might take another non-Power 5 conference team lightly. LSU 45, Western Kentucky 38 \nJoseph Goodman is a senior reporter and columnist for Alabama Media Group. He's on Twitter @JoeGoodmanJr and Facebook .
