(AP) - Marshall University's Board of Governors has selected the university's next president.\nThe university says the name won't be revealed until after the new president signs a contract and is approved by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission. The board hopes to announce the name within the next week.\nThe board approved the new president after meeting in executive session Monday.\nThree finalists visited the Huntington campus last week.\nThey were Mississippi State University provost and executive vice president Jerome Gilbert; Oregon Institute of Technology President Christopher Maples; and University of Southern Mississippi marine science professor Denis Wiesenburg.\nGary White has served as Marshall's interim president since last December following the death of President Stephen Kopp. The 63-year-old Kopp died on Dec. 17, 2014.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
