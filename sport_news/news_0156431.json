Two years of watching your team finish in last place in the National Hockey League. Two years when you didn’t have jack. \nBut now you do have Jack. \nJack Eichel, the wunderkind 18-year-old from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, by way of Boston University and a Hobey Baker Award, the No. 2 overall pick in last June’s draft, made his Sabres’ debut Thursday night. \nOn the anticipation meter, only Gil Perreault’s hello in 1970 (the franchise’s first season) and Pierre Turgeon’s in 1987 were the equal in Sabres’ lore. That’s because each was a No. 1 overall selection, and Eichel would have been had he not put on a pair of ice skates at the same time a kid named Connor McDavid did. Sabres open the Jack Eichel Era, and fans couldn't wait. LEO ROTH/staff photographer \nLet’s toss in the arrival of Santa Claus each year, too, because that’s the kind of buzz that was generated inside First Niagara Center by a sellout crowd — with every 15th person (or so it seemed) wearing a No. 15 Eichel jersey. \nI’d like to report that Eichel scored on his first NHL shift, stirring memories of Danny Gare and Alex Mogilny at the old Aud. It actually took him 23 shifts to record his first goal, a beautiful top-shelf wrist shot on the power play that left enough time for the goaltender to blink once. \nUnfortunately for Eichel and the Sabres, they staggered through an offensively challenged first two periods, lost their starting goalie, Robin Lehner to a leg injury, had a goal by newcomer Evander Kane wiped away by the new coach’s challenge rule (the play was offside), and they fell to the Ottawa Senators 3-1. \nWhen Ottawa scored just 30 seconds into the game — like turning the lights on for last call — you had a hunch this might not turn out to be one of those magical evenings in western New York sports history, not that we are spoiled. But Eichel scoring, and giving his dad, Bob, who was in attendance, a truly special present on his 55th birthday, and earning the game's second star, was something a million people will say 20 years from now they witnessed in person, even though only 19,070 will be telling the truth. \n“It’s obviously something I’ll never forget but it’s tough to really enjoy it when you don’t win the game,’’ Eichel said. “Coming out in the season opener, we played a great third period but at the end of the day we came up short.’’ \nBuffalo Sabres left winger Evander Kane (9) pursues Ottawa Senators defenseman Jared Cowen (2) during the first period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015 in Buffalo, N.Y. (AP Photo/Gary Wiepert) (Photo: Gary Wiepert, AP) \nThe good news is that it’s a long season. And in Eichel, there is a reason to come to the arena or turn on the television again. Yes he can thread a puck through a doughnut hole, shooting or passing. Yes, he’s got size and eyes in the back of his head. But it’s his skating — fluid, strong and fast — that’s got him playing with men when he should be attending fraternity parties. \nLike No. 11, Perreault, No. 15 gets you out of your seat. You can’t wait for his next shift and you can’t take your eyes off him. \n“I think it’s like when Jim Kelly came here originally and Gilbert Perreault,’’ said Steve Morris, 64, of Depew, Erie County, who was wearing a We Got Jack T-shirt. “Today, it’s really picking up.’’ \nWere two seasons of 30th-place hockey worth it? \n“To me it was,’’ Morris said. Fans Still Optimistic Despite Loss \nEichel took a regular shift between Kane, the star veteran obtained from Winnipeg and Sam Reinhart, last year’s No. 2 overall pick, and later coach Dan Bylsma put Zemgus Girgensons and Marcus Foligno on his wing. \nIt was Foligno who fed Eichel a perfect cross-slot pass on the power play. Eichel knew exactly what to do as he beat goaltender Craig Anderson midway through the third period. The deafening sound that erupted was likely heard all the way back in Boston. \n“The (new) guys on the bench asked ‘Have you ever heard it this loud?’ ‘’ Foligno said. “I said ‘No.’ It felt like a playoff game.\" \nWell, that is the idea. Get to the playoffs (and sip from a cup they call Stanley someday) after four years of missing them. \nEichel said before the game he didn’t want to ease into anything and Bylsma sure obliged. \nOn the night, he played his prized weapon a total of 28 shifts. That tied Kane with 21:58 of ice time. Eichel also had three shots, one hit, was 6 of 12 on faceoffs and a minus-1. After Kane’s goal was ruled off, Eichel very nearly got the equalizer on a nifty deke and shot that Anderson got a toe on. \n“A little bit of nerves at the beginning, first game, something you dream of your whole life,\" Eichel said. “I felt I shook them off towards the end of the game and got a little better. We have a lot of things to work on…but it was nice to play with a few different guys and try and build some chemistry. We have another game Saturday.\" \nYes, and many more after that. But there is only one debut. The loss aside, Jack Eichel made his one to remember. 24 CONNECT 19 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1Rx1AmD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:47:53.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
