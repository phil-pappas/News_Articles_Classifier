The bodies seem to be of pilgrims from Punjab who were swept away by the gushing waters of the Parbati river on July 23. A private bus carrying 69 pilgrims had plunged into the river near Sarari on the Bhunter-Manikaran road. Kullu Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Kanwar said the bodies were of men and seemed to be of those pilgrims who had gone missing. The DC said the dam authorities were carrying out desilting as the water level had receded. He said more bodies might be recovered. The dam authorities are undertaking the flushing operation from 6 am on Sunday to 4 am on Monday. Kanwar said relatives of the victims had already been informed and asked to identify the bodies. Rohit Rathore, SDM, Kullu, said two bodies were recovered in the morning and till evening, the number rose to eight. He said the bodies had been brought to Kullu hospital for identification and autopsy. Area residents said with the recovery of one body after another, there was an uneasy calm and workers were apprehensive of more findings. Some bodies had bracelets on their wrists which could help their family members in identification. On July 23, a 52-seater bus carrying 69 pilgrims, including 10 children, driver and conductor, had plunged into the river. Only eight bodies were recovered on the day of the accident while 38 were feared to be washed away. Twenty-three bodies have been recovered so far. The rescue operation was carried out by over 600 personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Home Guards and the police. The victims were from Bhatinda, Barnala and Mansa district from Punjab and were on their way to Manikaran Gurdwara.
