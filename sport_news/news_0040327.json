Shashank Manohar's return as the board's president has left his supporters and detractors thinking alike -What will be the man's first definitive move?\nThere are a host of issues that Manohar will look to tackle, and for the most important ones he's already set himself a deadline of two months. Among those issues, the primary ones are the fate of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, the grey areas involving conflict of interest -the most talked about being that of past president N Srinivasan -and the future of IPL COO Sundar Raman.\nManohar categorically underlined his intent that neither he nor his office will be vindictive in its approach. But far away in Chennai, those who owe their loyalty to Srinivasan sulked even as the Tamil Nadu bigwig spent the afternoon playing golf.\n\"As far as Srinivasan is concerned I have no stand because if he attends the board meetings, he would be dealt like any other member. And whatever decision is to be taken, it will be taken at the meeting,\" Manohar said of his former colleague in BCCI.\nAs Manohar begins his second stint, the SC-appointed Lodha panel is working on reforms that need to be carried out in Indian cricket. The apex court has already mentioned in its earlier order that Sundar Raman's role in IPL-BCCI need to be further looked into. And in the middle of all this, CSK and RR wait with fingers crossed how the board's new president will deal with them.\n\"It is hardly 25 minutes since I have taken over. You can't expect me to look into all the board records, all the papers and tell you what decision the board is going to take. At least give me two months' time and then you can ask me anything. There are a lot many issues and I have to address each one,\" Manohar said about the franchises.\nApart from resurrecting the board's image and reposing faith of the cricket fan, priorities that Manohar underlined would be among the primary ones, the above mentioned factors are some of the biggest decisions he'll have to act upon very soon.\nNone in the board so far has given an indication that Raman will have to go, despite the hyped scrutiny surrounding him. Neither has any senior board member suggested that CSK and RR will be terminated following the Lodha panel recommendations. But now, with Manohar at the helm of affairs, nobody really knows what's in store for all concerned.\nGiven the vocal manner in which he responded on Sunday about bringing in transparency within BCCI and eradicating conflict of interest, there's quite a chance that the lawyer from Nagpur will not be averse to drastic measures in his second term.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:16:43.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
