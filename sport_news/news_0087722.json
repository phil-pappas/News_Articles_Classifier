Momentarily deflated, Fort allowed Waynesboro back into the match with the next two points before the Indians could put the game away at 25-21. \nThis set a trend for the rest of the match. Waynesboro never despaired at the set point announcement. If anything, it was like a second starting gun, galvanizing the team at the very moment the match seemed lost. \nWaynesboro came one point closer to pulling off the comeback in the second set. Down 16-24, the Giants struck six unanswered points, but couldn’t outlast Fort, who put the next serve away, ending the set at 25-22. \nIt was a relief for Leonard, who didn’t want one sloppy set to come between what was an overall step in the right direction for her team. \n“We did a much better job than we have the last couple games we played,” she said. “We’ve been really inconsistent in the last two games so I was proud with our consistency. The second game probably wasn’t a pretty game but other than that I thought we had a good game.” \nThat second set was pretty much the last sniff the Giants had of a possible victory. Fort shrugged off an 0-2 deficit early in the third set and stormed to a 25-14 win. \nLeonard pointed to the seniors as the difference for Fort. \n“We needed a win because we’ve lost the last two, so we needed to come out and play with some enthusiasm and energy and we did. Our seniors are to the point where they’re seeing their season come to an end and they know that they need to become better leaders, because every game is the last time they’re going to play.” \nCheyenne Canipe led Fort Defiance with 14 digs. Joy Adler scored 10 kills and Madison Kimmel added 21 assists. \nMaryssa Jones had 20 digs for Waynesboro. Sykira Sease contributed 15 digs and Lauren Kelso had 5 kills. \nBoth teams go on the road for their next game on Tuesday October 13th. Fort plays at Turner Ashby and Waynesboro travels to Broadway.
