Utah State’s defense set up sophomore Kent Myers with short fields, and he capitalized on them. Utah State scored 35 of its 52 points off of turnovers.\nFor Boise State, it did not help that its No. 1 running back Jeremy McNichols was injured. His presence was deeply missed as the Broncos could not get their usual rushing yards. Penalties were the only things slowing down the Aggies. The Aggies, however, did not let those keep them off the board.\nThe upset brings the Aggies’ home winning streak to 12, which ranks as the fourth-longest home winning streak in school history.\nThis is the report card for the Utah State Aggies game versus No. 21 Boise State.\nQuarterback\nWith starting quarterback Chuckie Keeton out with a knee injury, Myers, who began the season as the back-up, made his third start in three games this season. Having beat Colorado State on homecoming weekend and then another win over Fresno State last week, the Aggies felt confident in their back-up quarterback to get the job done.\nAnd what a job he did. With help from his defense, Myers threw for three touchdowns and ran for one more. Against Colorado State two weeks ago, his legs got the job done. Last week against Fresno State, it was his arm.\nThe reports said he needed to use both against Boise State if the Aggies even stood a chance at beating the Broncos, and he listened. He was 17 for 24 for 157 yards, and he had 14 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown.\nIn three games, Myers has exceeded expectations. He had a very good game with both rushing and passing like he was supposed to.\nIn the fourth quarter, third-string quarterback Damion Hobbs came in for a few plays to give Myers a breather. Fans saw that the junior is a decent second-stringer behind Myers, who, at this point, will most likely be the starter for the rest of the season if Keeton doesn't return.\nMyers has had three terrific games, and he deserves a terrific grade.\nGrade: A\nRunning backs\nDevante Mays, LaJuan Hunt and Hunter Sharp were an effective committee. They combined for 93 yards and two touchdowns on the ground.\nMays had the best night of the three though. With 11 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown he was Utah State's go-to guy when it came to rushing the ball. In the first half, he had a breakout run of 48 yards that gave Utah State the spark it needed to keep its foot on the gas.\nWith the other two backs contributing good runs and being able to give Mays breaks throughout the game, they all put on a solid performance against a tough defense.\nGrade: A-\nWide receivers\nFor what Hunt and Sharp did not do rushing they made up for in receiving. The two combined for nine receptions for 93 yards and two touchdowns. Individually, Sharp stood out though. He had a team-high seven receptions for 42 yards and had two touchdowns.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:07:46.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
