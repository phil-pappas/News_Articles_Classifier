Barrett for a quarterback. Having both made things complicated for Ohio State. Now the Buckeyes believe they have hit on a solution for the Jones-Barrett quandary, with Jones handling duties until the Buckeyes reach the red zone and then Barrett taking over.\n\nThe tag-team system worked so well Saturday in a 49-28 victory over Maryland that Ohio State coach Urban Meyer named Jones and Barrett the co-offensive players of the game. The Buckeyes scored touchdowns all six times they got inside the Terrapins’ 20-yard line.\n>>  Dispatch  sports editor Ray Stein answers your questions about Buckeyes football during our weekly chat, 1 p.m. Thursday, dispatch.com/osuchat \n\nMeyer indicated the same arrangement would likely continue Saturday against Penn State.\n\n“I think so, but I’m not writing it in Sharpie yet,” he said.\n\nThe sharing of duties has advantages tactical and psychological. Jones’ big arm gives Ohio State a better chance to score from long distances. Largely overlooked in the hoopla about the dual system was that Jones played probably his best game of the season against Maryland.\n\nHe didn’t throw an interception, was accurate even on deep throws and efficient and prudent when big plays weren’t there.\n\nBut though Jones can be an effective runner on scrambles, the 6-foot-5, 250-pounder is not a nifty runner on designed runs. The closer the Buckeyes get to the end zone, the more compressed the field becomes, and Jones’ limitations as a runner are more obvious.\n>> Get the most out of college football season, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nEnter Barrett. He has a knack for sensing holes and making cuts to find daylight. He also has better touch on shorter passes than Jones.\n\nQuarterbacks coach and co-coordinator Tim Beck said that Barrett’s running ability can force defenses to change their coverage scheme.\n\n“It now allows more 1-on-1 things, as opposed to trying to fit it in tight zone windows,” he said.\n\nWhat also figures into the equation is the emotional lift the team got from having such a crucial player in its 2014 success get an opportunity to shine in meaningful opportunities.\n\n“J.T. comes out here every day to practice and does everything he can to make sure this team is ready to play,” safety Tyvis Powell said. “It’s good to see that they recognize that and want to get him on the field and they finally figured out a way (to use him).”\n\nMeyer alluded to how complicated the quarterback situation has been.\n\n“It’s very touchy with the two people involved, with the families involved, and I think we’re very leery of that,” he said. \n\nThat’s why seeing Barrett have success was so gratifying to him.\n\n“It can’t be better,” Meyer said, “than to have J.T. Barrett going in and have three touchdowns and see the smile on his face and be energized, and see a guy that's worked so hard and has his leadership skills and be able to use them more.”\n\nMeyer also praised Jones for being willing to relinquish some of his duties. The coach said he discussed the issue with Jones because the quarterback had earned it.\n\n“We want to do whatever it takes to win,” Jones said after Saturday’s game. “If it means sacrificing some playing time or swallowing egos at times, that’s no problem with us. That’s a testament to how we were trained all year round.”\n\nThis week represents a bigger challenge. Having success against Maryland is one thing. The Terrapins were reeling, with a defense ranked near the bottom nationally. Penn State (5-1, 2-0) ranks 10th nationally in total defense. The Nittany Lions offense has been inconsistent, but Christian Hackenberg is considered one of the most talented quarterbacks in the country.\n\nA year ago, Ohio State won in double overtime in State College after losing a 17-0 halftime lead. The Buckeyes regard that close call as a springboard to their national championship run.\n\nThe Nittany Lions were embarrassed in their season opener, losing to Temple for the first time since 1941. But they have regrouped. They dominated Indiana in the second half last week in a 29-7 victory.\n\n“You have to take them very seriously with the record they have and the type of talent they have, especially at the quarterback position,” Powell said. “That can change games.”\n\n@brdispatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:14:49.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
