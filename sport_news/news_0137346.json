I feel like it's where I belong.\"\nThomas will lead visiting Camden into a showdown Friday night against rival Camden Catholic in a game loaded with implications in both the Top 25 rankings and the West Jersey Football League Royal Division race. \nThomas is Camden's top rusher with 232 yards on 30 carries (7.7-yard average). He scored two touchdowns - one as a runner and one as a receiver - in the Panthers' 25-19 loss to top-ranked Delsea on Sept. 18. \nThomas is coming off his most productive game, as he went for 105 yards on just 10 carries in last weekend's 28-7 victory over Willingboro. \n\"He's done so many things for us,\" Camden coach Dwayne Savage said of the 6-foot-2, 210-pound Thomas, who has committed to Maine on a football scholarship. \"For him to just be able to focus on running back and linebacker, it's a beautiful thing.\" \nThomas played youth football for the Camden PAL Bulldogs along with Camden Catholic quarterback/defensive back Tyree Rodgers, an Old Dominion recruit. \n\"We're still close friends,\" Thomas said of Rodgers. \"But on Friday night, on the field, we'll be arch-enemies.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:52:10.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
