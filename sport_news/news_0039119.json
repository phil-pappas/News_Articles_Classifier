(AP) - The Royals will start hard-throwing youngster Yordano Ventura in Game 1 of the AL Divisional Series, regardless of whether Kansas City plays the Yankees or Astros on Thursday night.\nRoyals manager Ned Yost announced his starter before Tuesday's workout at Kauffman Stadium. Johnny Cueto will pitch the second game and Edinson Volquez will start Game 3.\nThe 24-year-old Ventura weathered a rollercoaster year that saw him briefly shipped to Triple-A. But the star of Game 6 of last year's World Series has rebounded down the stretch, going 4-1 with a 3.14 ERA in seven starts in September.\nCueto is 0-2 with a 5.19 ERA in three postseason starts, all with Cincinnati. Volquez is 0-2 with a 12.15 ERA in two postseason starts with the Reds and Pirates.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
