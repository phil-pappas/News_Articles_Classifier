Jones was set to be indicted for a felony hit-and-run if the case went to a grand jury. He could have faced up to five years in prison if convicted. \n“I am thankful to be able to do what I love once again and I look forward to proving myself as a champion in and outside of the Octagon,” Jones said. \nNo date has been set yet for Jone's return to the Octagon. UFC says it is discussing a potential date for his first fight back. To submit a comment on this article, your email address is required.
