Houston won on the road against the New York Yankees in the AL wildcard game on Tuesday, and the Chicago Cubs won at Pittsburgh in the National League wildcard game on Wednesday. \nMcHugh (1-0) allowed four hits in Houston’s win on Thursday, including a pair of solo homers by Kendrys Morales, while pitching around a 49-minute rain delay. The right-hander lasted six innings before turning the game over to his bullpen, which scattered three runners over the final three frames. \nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros, but they also scored via the same sort of small ball the Royals used in reaching the World Series last season. \nYordano Ventura (0-1) yielded three runs on four hits and a walk in two innings for Kansas City, but did not come back following the rain delay. \nIn Toronto, Yovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings, improving to 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against the Blue Jays. \nPrice (0-1) allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He dropped to 1-6 with a 4.79 ERA in 11 postseason games, including six starts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:52:04.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
