We dont need to shift it (because of the success). We still have plenty to prove. We have by no means arrived.”\nKyle Whittingham\nSALT LAKE CITY — Fans may be basking in the satisfying warmth of national attention, but the Utah football team is not.\nThe Utes have always seen themselves as outsiders who don’t quite get the respect they deserve. That identity manifests itself in everything from the attitude of its coaching staff to the type of players the program recruits. And for the last decade, the program hasn’t just relished its role as giant slayer, it's been central to the identity those signature wins have established.\n“For a lot of years that’s been our m.o.,” said Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham, who describes it is “playing with a chip on our shoulder. I think it’s helped us through the years and given us an edge.”\nWhittingham doesn’t see the Utes as underdogs anymore, and in fact, he told his players so before the historic win at Oregon. But the mentality of having something to prove persists, even if it takes on a different feel from player to player.\n“We still kind of have that mentality, even though we’re on more of a level playing field than ever before,” he said. “We still have that mentality engrained in our culture. We don’t need to shift it (because of the success). We still have plenty to prove. We have by no means arrived.”\nThat’s a sentiment echoed by Whittingham’s players and staff, although some still feel slighted by national media and fans.\nWhen asked what it feels like to go from being the hunter (trying to beat high-profile programs) to being the hunted (the team everyone wants to beat), team captain Gionni Paul shook his head.\n“No sir, we still kind of feel like underdogs,” he said. “Then again, on paper, on (stat) sheets, we’re the top dog. But every day we got to come with that same passion. I believe we are the same. No matter what they say on paper, deep down inside, we feel like we’re the underdogs.”\nWhat reinforces that for players like Paul is seemingly small things — like Utah not being ranked in the top 25 of preseason polls.\n“Nobody knew who Utah was even though we had a 9-4 season, and we beat half of these teams that was ranked in the top 25,” he said. “We’re still working hard and Utah is still here. We’re not going anywhere. For them to acknowledge that now is really a smack in our face. So we want to rub it in just a little bit more.”\nAnother team captain, senior linebacker Jared Norris, said it’s less about seeing themselves as underdogs and more about feeling like they have something to prove.\n“I don’t think we’ve ever viewed ourselves as underdogs,” he said. “We just have the mentality that we’ve already out-worked you, so we’re just going to show what we’ve done on the field. The work doesn’t stop because it’s game day.” He said seeing football programs in terms of giants and giant slayers may be an over-simplification.\n“There is so much that goes into each team, how they do things,” he said, pointing to some of Utah’s recent signature wins, including beating Stanford in 2013 at home when the Cardinal was ranked No. 5. He said it much more often boils down to how teams match up against each other rather than who has garnered national attention and who has not.\nStill, he admits not being ranked in preseason polls did provide some fuel for the Utes’ competitive fire.\n“We thought that was kind of ridiculous,” he said, without smiling. “It did kind of fire us up. We wanted to show the nation what we could do. But we’re still just taking each week for what it is and trying to get better week-to-week.\nThe key for Utah is reinforcing the belief that they're a top-tier program while continuing to find reasons to compete with the kind of hunger that has helped the Utes surprise everyone but themselves. That becomes more critical as fans become accustomed to success and expectations shift from upsets to perennial title hopes.\nBut if fans or media get a bit greedy about how the Utes win or the margins of victory, he said that doesn’t bother the players actually on the field earning those victories.\n“A win is a win,” he said. “We can get beat by the worst team in the nation or the best team in the nation. We just have the mindset, we want to win no matter how we get it. Even if we have to scratch and claw for it.”\nSenior wide receiver Kenneth Scott said it’s not hard to play with purpose, especially when it comes to having something to prove.\n“I still believe there is doubt out there about us,” Scott said. “I think a lot of the players feel the same way. I think we’ll always have something to prove.”\nHe points to those who no longer see preseason unanimous No. 1 Ohio State as the nation’s best football team.\n“Even they have doubters now,” Scott said. “So we’ve just got to remain humble and keep working. There will always be doubters, even if we’re number one. Then we’ll have to prove why we are number one.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:22:01.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
