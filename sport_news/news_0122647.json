Dartmouth is off to its best start since 1997. \nDartmouth, playing as a ranked FCS team for the first time in 19 years, needed its stingy defense, ranked third nationally at 9.4 points per game. The Big Green rushed for a season-low 88 yards but held Columbia to 61 on the ground and 167 overall. \nDalyn Williams threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Victor Williams in the second quarter for a 13-3 lead. \nCharlie Miller's first interception, at the Dartmouth 39, with under a minute left sealed the win. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:22:53.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
