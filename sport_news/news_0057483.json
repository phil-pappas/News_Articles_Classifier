She finished with 206.01 points. \nGold doubled an intended triple Salchow late, but that was the only blemish in an otherwise brilliant performance by the 20-year-old. She won the free skate and finished with 202.80 points. \nWorld silver medalist Satoko Miyahara of Japan was third with 188.07 points. \nChina's Sui Wenjing and Han Cong rallied to win the pairs, topping U.S. champions Alexa Scimeca and Christopher Knierim. The Chinese duo finished at 202.00, and Scimeca and Knierim followed at 191.97. \nCanada's Julianne Seguin and Charlie Bilodeau were third, followed by Olympic silver medalists Ksenia Stolbova and Fedor Klimov of Russia. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:54:21.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
