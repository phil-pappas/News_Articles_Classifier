This is the first increase in camping fees since 2010. Depending upon the type of site, fee increases range from $2 to $10 per night. Yurts and cabins incurred the greatest hike. The current camping fees will not change for people who have already made future reservations. Most camping fees range from $10 to $28, not including the reservation fee and park pass. Every vehicle entering the park, including RVs and towed vehicles, must have a park pass for each day. Annual park passes are $70, and most daily parks passes are $7.
