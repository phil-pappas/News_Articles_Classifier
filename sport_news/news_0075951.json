Heading back to Arizona from their weekend hunting in northeast South Dakota, the Teal family is pleased with their time in the fields this year. \n\"This is my third year hunting here. This was probably the best bird population that we've seen,\" Zac Teal said. \n\"We noticed the increase in birds last year and again this year,\" Gary Teal said. \nThose observations are in line with South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks estimates. Bird counts two years ago were the lowest they’d been in decades. The pheasant population has increased each year since. \nWildlife officials are also expecting hunter numbers to rise with the bird count. Activity at the Aberdeen Regional Airport could indicate that's happening, as well. \nThe Teals had trouble booking tickets. They needed to come to Aberdeen on different flights because there wasn't room for all of them on one. \nFlights to the Hub City have been booked at or above capacity during the beginning of hunting season. Many on those flights are coming to South Dakota for pheasants. \nThere is an extra daily flight to Aberdeen to accommodate the traffic. That is an expected move every year, but officials with the Aberdeen Convention and Visitors Bureau have been communicating with groups planning their first pheasant hunting trip to South Dakota. \n\"Just had a great time, great people and the hunting was very, very good so we'll be back next year,\" Gary Teal said. \n\"Absolutely, wouldn't miss it,\" Zac Teal said. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
