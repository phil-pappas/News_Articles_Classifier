(AP Photo/Don Wright) more > By BOB BAUM   \nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) - Meet the new loss, same as the old loss. \nThat was coach Bruce Arians’ assessment of his Arizona Cardinals’ 25-13 defeat at Pittsburgh on Sunday. \nArians called the game “identical” to the Cardinals’ other loss, 24-22 at home to the St. Louis Rams on Oct. 4. \n“It was us beating us,” he said on Monday. \nIn both games, despite playing poorly, the Cardinals had a chance to win it late. \nThis time, trailing 18-13, the Cardinals drove from their 21-yard line and, after Carson Palmer’s 19-yard pass to John Brown, had the ball at the Steelers’ 20. On the next play, Palmer threw deep to Brown but safety Mike Mitchell leaped in front of Brown to intercept in the end zone. Palmer said after the game he didn’t see Mitchell before he threw. \nAgainst the Rams, Palmer overthrew the intended receiver late on a play that would have put Arizona in position for a game-winning field goal. \nArians rated Palmer’s performance on Sunday “average to poor.” \nThe Cardinals quarterback racked up big numbers, completing 29 of 45 passes for 421 yards. It was his eighth career 400-yard game, but he threw for just one touchdown and was intercepted twice. \n“He made a lot of throws and we made a lot of catches,” Arians said, “but we didn’t execute very well inside the 20-yard line.” \nThe Cardinals, who entered the game as the NFL’s highest-scoring team, had one touchdown in four trips inside the red zone. That makes them 2-of-9 in the red zone in their two losses. In Arizona’s four wins, the Cardinals had 16 touchdowns in 17 red zone visits. \nArizona had 279 yards to the Steelers’ 59 in the first half, but led only 10-3. \nBrown caught 10 passes for a career-best 196 yards, but his fumble gave Pittsburgh the ball at the Arizona 32-yard line early in the third quarter. That led to Landry Jones’ eight-yard touchdown pass to Martavis Bryant and the Steelers took the lead for good, 12-10. \nJones had never thrown a pass in an NFL game and his TD toss was his first completion. \nArizona safety Tony Jefferson was a teammate of Jones at Oklahoma and joked that the quarterback knew better than to throw the ball his way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:06:42.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
