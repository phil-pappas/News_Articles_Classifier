It also is the official repository for some Midwestern Native American artifacts and its galleries have been an important showcase for Illinois artists. In a July letter supporting the museum, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin called it “an internationally recognized institution with a strong reputation for scientific excellence.”\nEDITORIAL\nFollow @csteditorials\nBut on Oct. 1, the museum was closed to save money. Professional staff members were laid off, though union employees continue to be paid for now. Fewer tourists will show up in Springfield, and city officials fear an economic loss far greater than the estimated initial savings of $400,000 from the closing. The American Alliance of Museums’ Accreditation Commission voted 7-0 last week to put the museum on probation.\nReturning to normal operations won’t be simply a matter of re-opening the doors when money is available. Since being laid off, most of the museum’s scientists, widely viewed as a top-flight staff, have left permanently. You can’t easily replace people who are familiar with collections, who are engaged in the research, and who have important relationships with other agencies.\nNationally recognized scholar Bonnie W. Styles, the well-regarded director, was forced to retire. Paleoecologist Eric Grimm, the museum’s director of science, has moved to the University of Minnesota. One department head has taken a job heading a museum in another state. Seven senior staff members have taken early retirement. None of these people will be back.\n“With those people gone, it is not going to be the same institution no matter what you do going forward,” said George Rabb, former director of the Brookfield Zoo and a member of the Illinois State Museum Board. “It is going to take a lot of effort to attract people to an institution that has been so savagely impacted by being a pawn in this political budget game.”\nThe museum has plenty of specimens representing species that have gone extinct. Good fiscal sense seems about to join them.\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: Follow @csteditorials\nTweets by @CSTeditorials", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/csteditorials", "https://twitter.com/CSTeditorials"], "published": "2015-10-26T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:50:23.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
