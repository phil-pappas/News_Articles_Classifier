When they jumped, I looked at Gipson in the huddle and said, ‘Go win the game.’” \nGipson, a 6-2, 240-pound senior tight end/linebacker, was stuffed on a two-point conversion run at the end of the season-opening 19-18 loss to Riverside Brookfield, so he wasn’t surprised when his number was called instead of Hoard, who had rushed for 171 yards and two touchdowns on 34 carries. \n“No, when they jumped I knew coach was on the same page and I just wanted to win the game,” Gipson said. “The same thing happened against RB. I was not going to be denied this time.” \nThe Mustangs faked a toss to Hoard and Gipson barreled up the middle. \n“I knew he was going to get it,” Organ said. “There was no doubt in my mind. \n“As soon as he came back to me I said, ‘no more RB.’ That’s off his mind now because he took [the RB loss] hard.” \nThis had the makings of another hard-luck loss. The Mustangs had a punt blocked on their opening possession and Leyden’s Jalen Moore scored on an 11-yard run on the ensuing play. \nMorton lost a fumble on its second possession and a bad punt snap on the third series gave the Eagles the ball at the Mustangs 8-yard line. \nBut junior corner back Santino Novakowski stopped Leyden quarterback Michael Wilms for a three-yard loss on fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line. \nNovakowski later had a strip and his first career fumble recovery and a pair of pass deflections as the Morton defense allowed just 173 yards of total offense. \n“The whole week the coaches told us the plays that they were going to run, so we’ve been busting our butts,” Novakowski said. “The scout offense did good running their plays and the defense stepped up. That’s all that matters.” \nMorton tied the game on Hoard’s 18-yard run with eight seconds left in the first half, but Leyden’s Dominic Fredrickson returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown to put the Eagles ahead 14-7 at the 8:08 mark of the fourth quarter. \nYet the Mustangs prevailed. \n“Adversity is a big thing that comes our way so we learned how to tough it through,” Gipson said. “We said we’ve been through this before and we’re going to come out on top this time. That’s what we did.” \n– \nWho: Morton at Hinsdale South \nWhen: 7:30 p.m Oct. 23 \nWhere: 7401 Clarendon Hills Road \nRecords: Morton 3-5 (3-2 WSG), Hinsdale South 5-3 (4-1) \nOutlook: The Mustangs are out of the playoff chase but they can still play the role of spoiler for Hinsdale South, which needs a win to secure a playoff spot. The Hornets are the highest-scoring offense in the West Suburban Gold, scoring nearly 35 points per game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:38:06.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
