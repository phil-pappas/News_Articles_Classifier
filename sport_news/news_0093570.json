(AP) â€” Texas Tech gave away its best chance to compete with Oklahoma.\nPatrick Mahomes passed for 233 yards and ran for 58 for the Red Raiders, but he threw four interceptions in a 63-27 loss to the 17th-ranked Sooners on Saturday.\n\"If you turn it over that many times, it's four times you don't get to possess the ball or continue drives,\" Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \"We just have to make better plays, take care of the ball better and just play better.\"\nSamaje Perine ran for 201 yards and four touchdowns and helped quarterback Baker Mayfield top his old team. Mayfield transferred from Tech after his freshman season in 2013 and had to sit out last year because the school blocked him from playing right away.\nMayfield stayed calm enough to complete 15 of 22 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns.\n\"Obviously, football's an emotional game, and I used to attend there,\" he said. \"It's just a fact. So there was little bit coming into it, but I had to look at it like a normal game. That's the focus we came into it with, and that's how we had to execute.\"\nJoe Mixon ran for 154 yards and two scores, and the Sooners (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) ran for 405 yards.\n\"It's frustrating as a defensive lineman to see guys going off like that,\" Texas Tech's Branden Jackson said, \"but we can't do anything but go back to work and put out a better performance next week.\"\nDeAndre Washington ran for 94 yards and a touchdown for the Red Raiders (5-3, 2-3).\nMayfield walked on and started at Tech two years ago before losing the job, and he transferred because he believed Tech had no plans to offer him a scholarship. In his first game against his former team, he helped the Sooners gain 617 total yards.\nIt was the fourth 200-yard game of Perine's career, and the most yards for the sophomore since he set the FBS record with 427 last season against Kansas.\nOklahoma jumped to a 21-3 lead, but two turnovers became scores for the Red Raiders. Reginald Davis caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes, and Washington scored from 13 yards out to bring the Red Raiders back.\nPerine rumbled in from 10 yards out to give the Sooners a 28-17 halftime lead. He ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns before the break, and Mixon added 67 yards and two scores.\nMark Andrews caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Mayfield to make it 35-17. Perine got loose again for a 48-yard run and closed the drive with a six-yard score. The Sooners took a 49-27 lead into the fourth quarter.\n___\nAP college football website: collegefootball@ap.org\n___\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
