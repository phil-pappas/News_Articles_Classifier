Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle and D’Angelo Russell all figure to lead the roster into the future, but this year they must defer somewhat to Bryant.\nThey insisted Friday that little will change without Bryant on the court, however.\n“It’s the same whether he’s out there or not out there,” Randle said. “Dudes are making basketball plays, being aggressive, making the right play.”\nClarkson said the intensity “definitely turns up when (Bryant) steps on the court.”\nScott said Bryant will receive treatment from team trainers Saturday morning but would not travel with the team to San Diego.\nBryant averaged 13 points in 18.2 minutes in the first five preseason games. Russell said the rest of the Lakers might need to be more aggressive offensively to make up for Bryant’s absence.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:26:32.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
