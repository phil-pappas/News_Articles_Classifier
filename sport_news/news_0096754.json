Minnesota won the first game 7-1 and pulled to one game behind the Angels for the second wild-card spot - Los Angeles lost to Oakland Wednesday night. Cleveland is five games behind L.A. and still faced potential elimination Wednesday if the Astros beat the Mariners later. Anderson (7-3) held the Twins to two hits and won his fifth straight start. Cleveland scored four runs in the second off Mike Pelfrey (6-11), who lasted 1 2-3 innings, and Francisco Lindor, continuing his case for rookie of the year, belted a two-run homer in the fourth. \n\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Kyle Gibson pitched six shutout innings and Torii Hunter had a three-run double as the Minnesota Twins gained ground in the AL wild-card race, winning their fourth straight in a 7-1 victory over the fading Cleveland Indians in the first game of a doubleheader. Joe Mauer and Byron Buxton hit a solo homers for Minnesota, which entered play trailing the Angels by 1 1/2 games for the AL's second wild card. The loss dealt another setback to Cleveland's slim playoff hopes. The Indians began Wednesday five games behind the Angels, who host Oakland in a night game. Gibson (11-11) wasn't affected by having his start pushed back by Tuesday night's rainout. The right-hander struck out nine, matching a career high, and held Cleveland to four hits. Carlos Carrasco (14-12) was roughed up in his final start of the season, allowing five runs in three-plus innings. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
