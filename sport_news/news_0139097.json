The city will soon have an IPL-style football league that promises to further popularize the sport in the city.\nJuggernaut, the pioneers of small-team football (6-a-side), will launch Ahmedabad Champions League (ACL), the city's first 6-a-side football tournament.\nA total of eight teams will vie for top honours in the inaugural edition of ACL that is set for the kick off on December 19.\n\"The league will be played at Juggernaut Arena which boasts of the first FIFA-approved turf in Ahmedabad. The ground size of 120 feetx70 feet is designed for 6-a-side football,\" said a press statement issued by the organisation.\nBefore the kick-off, the eight franchise owners will open up their purses to buy players through an auction to be held on December 1.
