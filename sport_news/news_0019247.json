The defending 3A state champion Chargers (8-0, 4-0 South Mountain 2A/3A Athletic Conference) set a Cleveland County record for consecutive wins with 24 – now unbeaten since opening night of the 2014 season. On top of that, senior running back and Virginia signee, Tre Harbison, rushed for 124 yards on 13 carries and is now the school’s all-time leading rusher with 4,692 yards. Harbison scored on a 34-yard dash in the first quarter to put Crest ahead in a game it never trailed. The 5-11, 212-pounder also caught two second-quarter passes for touchdowns from Willie Green III – from 38 and 68 yards, respectively – to finish with 241 total yards. “It’s always nice to be a part of Cleveland County (history), because this is a very prestigious county,” Harbison said. “But really, it’s all about the O-line. Without them, I’m nothing.” The Chargers’ defensive backfield also shined, nabbing five interceptions – one each by Tyriek Ramseur, DeQuondre Wilson, Diquan Spikes, Michael McCluney and Tavian Brintley. Wilson returned his pick 32 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, while Ramseur, Spikes and McCluney saw their interceptions set up Crest touchdown drives. Four of the five takeaways were inside the Chargers’ own 30 as East Burke (4-4, 3-2) drove down the field but couldn’t finish. “They (our defense) played well again,” first-year Crest coach Will Clark said. “Good teams are going to drive the football. Good teams are going to complete slants. We just have to limit what they do.” Crest capped its scoring on a 69-yard spiral from Green to Tyshun Odum at 4:14 in the third and a 33-yard field goal by Evan Davis with just under one minute left in the game. Green finished 12 for 18 for 335 yards, three touchdowns and one interception, which was returned 15 yards for a touchdown by East Burke’s Jake Prestwood for the Cavaliers’ lone touchdown with 5:04 left in the third quarter. While Crest hit on plenty of big plays – on both sides of the ball -- for a convincing win, they were also mired by penalties (12 for 90 yards, while East Burke was not flagged), lost fumbles (three) and a handful of miscues on the center-quarterback exchange. The penalties and miscues allowed East Burke to often control the time of possession. The Cavs kept drives alive as quarterback Joe Duckworth (14-32, 107 yards) managed to find Ryan Newell and Christian Parson on short passes, while Brandon Clark (27-76 yards) ran between the tackles. “Our kids played hard tonight, but I’ve got to do a better job of getting them prepared,” Clark said. “But it’s 37-7. Our kids win, and they have to enjoy that.” Page 2 of 2 - Crest travels to East Rutherford next Friday, while East Burke hosts R-S Central. Note: Harbison broke Martray Littlejohn’s Crest rushing record (4,687, 2001-04). The Crest 24-game winning streak eclipsed 23-game streaks by Shelby High (2005-07) and old Cleveland High in the late 1950’s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:35:27.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
