He understands the passing game in the National Football League. He's an aware player, he's got good ball skills, he's got good transition skills.\"\nPorter's also got plenty of experience. In 60 starts prior to this season, the 5-foot-11, 188-pound Porter had 10 interceptions and 52 pass breakups.\n\"He's got skins on the wall -- he's done it before, and at a high level,\" Fox said. \"It was just a matter of getting him healthy enough to go out there so he could perform.\"\nPorter was available in the off-season when Washington waived him after he played in just three games before landing on injured reserve with a shoulder injury.\n\"The guy understands the game,\" defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said. \"He can watch tape and see things. You can talk to him as a coach and talk to him on a high level. The guy really understands football, and he's been a big help to us.\"\nGo Cubs go: Vic Fangio believes he's the Cubs' good-luck charm because of the success of MLB teams in the cities he previously worked.\nThe San Francisco Giants won three World Series while Fangio was with the 49ers. When he was the Houston Texans defensive coordinator (2002-05), the Astros got to their only World Series, where they were swept by the White Sox in 2005.\n\"It's in the bag, don't even worry about it,\" Fangio said of the Cubs' chances. \"Just like the Red Sox ended their curse by going through their arch rival, the Yankees, in the playoffs, the Cubs have done the same. They went through the Cardinals.\n\"Plus, you've got another guy from northeastern PA, where I'm from, (manager) Joe Maddon, leading the team.\"\nFangio grew up a Phillies fan, and he credits his old team with sparking the Cubs' hot finish.\n\"You know the Phillies got the Cubs' season on track?\" Fangio said. \"They swept them (July 24-26). What's their record since then?\"\nAfter that sweep, the Cubs went 46-19 to finish the regular season. Counting the postseason, they're 50-20 since being swept by the Phillies.\nHealth beat: The injury list remains lengthy, but wide receiver Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) finally was able to practice on a limited basis.\nOther players who were limited were linebacker Pernell McPhee (groin); defensive linemen Jeremiah Ratliff (ankle), Ego Ferguson (knee) and Will Sutton (elbow); offensive linemen Jermon Bushrod (passed concussion protocol) and Patrick Omameh (ankle); and (wide receiver Josh Bellamy (groin).\nFour players did not practice at all: wide receiver Eddie Royal (ankle), linebacker Shea McClellin (knee), safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) and cornerback Terrance Mitchell (hamstring).\nMoving on up: Linebacker Jonathan Anderson was promoted from the practice squad to the active roster.\nThe undrafted rookie out of TCU spent the first five weeks on the practice squad. In the preseason he had 2 sacks and 3 tackles for loss, a forced fumble and 2 special-teams tackles.\nHe's back: Quarterback David Fales, who was waived from the 53-man roster Tuesday, was signed to the practice squad a day later.\nFales was drafted by the Bears in the sixth round (183rd overall) in 2014 out of San Jose State.\nRelated Article\nMcPhee coming on strong for Chicago Bears Get great articles like this sent to your inbox!
