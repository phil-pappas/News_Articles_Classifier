For the most part, Harvick breezed by the field, leading 355 of the 400 laps on Sunday. Finishing behind Harvick at Dover were Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jamie McMurray, and Aric Almirola. Last week, Harvick and crew let a lead slip away last week at New Hampshire making Sunday’s race a must win for the no. 4 Chevrolet. While a late caution, the ninth of day, opened the door for others with 24 laps to go, Harvick took charge on the restart to out-pace second-place finisher Busch while earning a berth into the 12-driver Contender Round of the Chase. “It’s just that never-quit attitude,” said Harvick after the race. “Anytime you can go through moments like this and gain some momentum and prove to yourself that you can do things like this there’s no way you can be stronger.” Along with Harvick, 11 other drivers qualified for the Contender Round Sunday including Matt Kenseth, Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, Carl Edwards, Martin Truex Jr., Kurth Busch, Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski, Kyle Busch, Ryan Newman, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Meanwhile, Jamie McMurray, Clint Bowyer, Jimmie Johnson, and Paul Menard were eliminated from the Chase after Sunday’s race. The opening race of the Contender Round will be held next week in the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:36:29.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
