The Michigan tight end is one of the best at his position in the game and is second on the team with 22 catches and 274 yards receiving. Harris is a linebacker with the speed to run with him. \n“Absolutely,” MSU co-defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett said when asked if Harris is a viable option on Butt. “A veteran guy that is smart, that understands. Good football player that is looking forward to his last Michigan game I’m sure.” \nHow much Harris actually covers Butt will depend on how Michigan lines up and how many receivers are in its formations. The Spartans will be conscious of Butt across the board. \n“Now your linebackers are more involved in the coverage part of it as far as understanding, ‘Hey, this is a main target. This is somebody they really like to throw the ball to,’” Barnett said of the Butt talk this week. “So not that they’re not always, week to week saying, ‘Hey, I got to pay attention to what’s going on in the passing game.’ But you really have to pay attention and have attention to detail when it’s a tight end catching all the balls in your coverage area. It’s big and it can make a difference.” \nHarris has been good against the run and pass this season, with a pair of pass break-ups and 37 tackles to rank third on the team. Like the rest of MSU’s seniors, he’s hoping for his first win at Michigan Stadium in his second try. \n“We weren't able to come out victorious (in a 12-10 loss in 2012),” Harris said. “So definitely big for us, big for this team. We know it's going to be a great environment there, 112,000 or how many they're going to be able to squeeze in there, so it would be big for us and for this program to come out with a win.” Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1RJglmq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:50:02.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
