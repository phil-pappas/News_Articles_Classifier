It ensures that sections are all the same size, which eliminates the need for guesswork. Overall, it promotes efficiency. The invention is easy to use and suitable for both professional and DIY woodcutters.\nThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
