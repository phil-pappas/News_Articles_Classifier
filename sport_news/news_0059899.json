Yoenis Cespedes and David Wright each had three hits for the Mets. Cespedes scored the go-ahead run on a two-out wild pitch by Trevor Cahill on a strikeout of Michael Conforto in the sixth inning.

Jeurys Familia closed for his fifth save of the playoffs. The Mets can advance to the World Series for the first time in 15 years with one more victory over Chicago in Game 4 of the best-of-seven matchup Wednesday night.
