This could be the breakthrough he needs to kick start his Chelsea career. \nAgainst a struggling Aston Villa side who have only one win all season, Mourinho will be normally expected to throw caution to the wind and play a gung-ho side in a bid to restore a bit of confidence for his beleaguered Blues. This should play into the hands of Rahman, who will provide great attacking width on the left side to compliment Eden Hazard’s effort. \nKnowing Mourinho though, this is not a given. Reports indicate Kurt Zouma has been penciled for the right back position with Azpilicueta to continue his role on the left. Ghanaians hope the former is adopted. Given his extra days of training with the club after missing the international break, Baba should make good use of the starting berth if given the nod. \nJORDAN AYEW: \nIn the opposing dressing room at Stamford Bridge at will be Jordan Ayew. The former Lorient man has had a slow start to his Premier League campaign and one could argue his brother’s fine form has added an additional weight of expectation on him. \nJordan has all the attributes needed to thrive in the league - pace and technique. Considering how the technical players in the league such as Mata, Ozil, Silva and Cazorla and recently Dimitry Payet have thrived in the league, Jordan will need one good game to boost his confidence. \nFacing a Chelsea team defence who fear pace and were recently terrorized by Senegalese Sadio Mane, this could be the perfect platform for him to launch himself. In his way stands Scott Sinclair and Rudy Gestede who for now are finding the net against opponents. It is very likely Jordan will start from the bench. But should he start, he has got the weapons to inflict more misery on Chelsea all with a little confidence. \nCHRISTIAN ATSU: \nPoor Atsu. \nHe still awaits his Premiership debut with Eddie Howe’s side and Saturday’s encounter against Man City at the Etihad may well see no change. He has clearly not worked his way into Howe’s plans. \nIn an away game against, Pellegrini’s City, Bournemouth may not see enough of the ball and a more defensive approach may be expected. An injury in pre-season could have well hampered his development at the club. After his return to full fitness, Atsu has still not be given a look in. \nHe has made a few appearances in the Capital One Cup, but Atsu - and most Ghanaians - know the real deal is the Premier League. Max Gradel’s injury could have paved the way for Atsu but Marc Pugh’s and Matt Ritchie’s fine form will still be a hindrance for Atsu. The season is long and sooner Rather than later, Atsu will make his debut. The question will be what impact he can make on the Bournemouth and how best he can take his chances when given the opportunity. \nJEFFREY SCHLUPP: \nGhana’s most consistent in the Premier League so far. Week in, week out, Schlupp has started for the Foxes and he has delivered. Up next for Schlupp and his teammates is a trip to St. Mary’s Stadium to face Southampton. This will be an interesting fixture for neutrals as both teams will hold nothing back in search of a win. From the Ghanaian perspective, key interest will be on Schlupp and how much he will be able to contain the inter changeable attacking trio of Southampton’s Dusan Tadic, Sadio Mane and Steven Davis. These three made light work of Chelsea a fortnight ago and will hope for a repeat. Should Ranieri opt for a more defensive approach, German Chris Fuchs will line up at the left back position with Jeffrey Schlupp in the left midfield role. Either way, there is one inevitable fact for Schlupp, he is set to start barring any injury. \nDEDE AYEW: \nGhana’s darling boy in the league by far. Every goal and assist by the attacking midfielder has been greeted with great merriment in the country. \nUp next for Dede is a home game against Mark Hughes’ Stoke City. He is a big doubt for the game after he picked up a knock against Tottenham but should he play, he has some questions to answer. Critics have argued that he has failed to have the needed impact of the relatively ‘smaller’ games. \nKey references have been made to their games against Watford and Sunderland. But as many will know, Dede is a big game man who loves the big occasion but this is no justification inconsistencies. The blame could also be laid at the doorstep of the whole Swansea who find it hard to generally motivate themselves in these types of games. One player does not make the team. The earlier Garry Monk’s side start picking those points, the closer they will get to the magic 40 point mark they set each season. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
