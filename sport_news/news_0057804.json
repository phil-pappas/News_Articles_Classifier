Show Caption Previous Next \nIsaac Robinson broke Tusculum College's single-game rushing record with 250 yards in a 20-0 victory at Brevard on Saturday at Memorial Stadium. \nRobinson shaved five yards off the record established by Walter Dette on Nov. 18, 1930 against Biltmore (now UNC Asheville). Robinson broke the record on his last carry of the game, a seven-yard touchdown run with 2:05 left in the contest. \nRobinson also set a single-game mark with 39 carries, breaking the record set by B.J. Spradlin in 2012. \nThe Pioneers (2-3, 1-2 South Atlantic Conference) snapped a three-game losing streak and won at Brevard for the first time since 2007. It was Tusculum's first shutout in the SAC since joining the league in 1998. \nTusculum, which entered the contest with the No. 3 pass offense in NCAA Division II at 383.8 yards per game, was forced to run the ball due to the inclement weather conditions which included high winds and heavy rain. \nThe Pioneers finished with 325 yards, including 305 on the ground on 55 attempts. \nTusculum limited Brevard (0-5, 0-2) to 169 yards, recorded four sacks and forced three turnovers (two fumbles, one interception).
