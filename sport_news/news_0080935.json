You can’t lose a game if you don’t give up a goal,” Clarke said with a laugh. On Monday, the Saints followed Rule No. 1, something they have had a little trouble doing recently. St. Bernard allowed just four shots by Griswold, and only one of them was of the dangerous variety, as the Saints scored a 1-0 win over the Wolverines. The shutout gave St. Bernard at least a share of the Eastern Connecticut Conference Small Division title. A win over Wheeler on Wednesday will give the Saints (7-6-1, 7-1-1 ECC Small) the title by themselves for the fourth time in five years. “It’s a lot of pressure,” St. Bernard senior Ally Andrade said of the legacy the Saints have to live up to in the sport. “We just work very hard and have confidence in ourselves.” That confidence has been shaken recently. The Saints were coming into the match off three losses in their last four games and those three losses — to Old Lyme, Ledyard and Lyman — were by a 13-1 total. Andrade, who plays center-back for the Saints, said the loss to the Bulldogs, especially, was hard to swallow. “Everyone started to put their heads down and let the game get to them. I told them during that game to not look at the score and play 100 percent, no matter what it is. You play like it’s 0-0 all the time and, at least, be proud of all the effort that you put in,” Andrade said. That voice of authority from the back has been crucial for the Saints this season. “I’ve groomed her since she’s been here. I was a center-back when I was playing and I love (the position). Teaching her how to do it and seeing her improve at it has been very pleasing to me,” Clarke said. “You don’t get the headlines, but the team knows. The team knows who is important and who is holding everything together and she’s been that for us the entire season.” The only dangerous chance by the Wolverines came late in the first half when Kayleigh Waters sent a ball in that hit off the crossbar and bounded over the net. St. Bernard only had 10 shots of its own, but one of them found the back of the net. Alicia Crespo sent a nice ball to the foot of Kara Bassett and she rifled it home from about 17 yards out just over 8 minutes into the second half. Page 2 of 2 - “I knew I had to get it in, because we had a lot of opportunities in the first half and just needed to get one in. I knew we would be able to pick it up as a team,” Bassett said. Her shot found the opposite side of the net, the only ball that escaped the grasp of Griswold freshman keeper Brianna Becotte. “She’s been rock solid for us all season long,” Wolverines coach Chris Morth said of his keeper. “She’s got a lot of experience at the Olympic development level and premier level. She comes in and just provides us with something we haven’t had here since I’ve been here and to have that out of a freshman is very nice. I’m never worried, never concerned. She’s a very calming influence back there.” Clarke is not concerned about the losses in crossover games that the Saints have incurred against teams like Waterford, Bacon Academy, Ledyard and Norwich Free Academy and the non-league contest with Old Lyme. He’s hopeful those contests will pay dividends in the postseason. “It’s the toughest (schedule) we’ve had that I can remember since I’ve been here for the last 9 or 10 years and I think it will prepare us for the state tournament. Looking at some of the other (Class S) teams, there are several that are very, very good, but none that I’m afraid of. I think if we can get in the right bracket, we can do very well,” Clarke said. The Saints are currently in the No. 18 spot and that’s not a bad place to be. The second-seeded team in Class S is currently Med-Ed Prep which plays a much less challenging schedule.
