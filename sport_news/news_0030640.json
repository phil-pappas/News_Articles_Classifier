(Getty Images) \nThe game didn't mean as much as anyone would have hoped a couple months ago, but Arkansas-Auburn still proved to be an entertaining game, as the Razorbacks topped the Tigers 54-46 in four overtimes on Saturday. \nThere were no SEC West title hopes on the line, just two disappointing teams trying to fight and claw their way to better second halves and, ideally, the postseason. Arkansas got a win it badly needed, moving to 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the SEC to keep hope alive for going to a bowl game, while Auburn -- who started the season ranked sixth -- drops to 4-3, and just 1-3 in the SEC. \nThe game featured one more touchdown (seven) in overtime than regulation (six). After Auburn tied the game at 21 with 7:38 left in the fourth quarter, Arkansas thought it had the game-winning field goal with 1:10 left, but defensive lapses resulted in Auburn's Daniel Carlson kicking a 41-yard field goal with eight seconds left to send the game to overtime. \nThe teams traded punches, with each team scoring touchdowns in the first two periods. In the third, both scored touchdowns and converted the required two-point attempts. In the fourth, Brandon Allen found Drew Morgan for 25-yard touchdown, which proved to be the game-winner, as Auburn failed to find the end zone on its final possession. \nArkansas dominated early, jumping out to a 14-0 lead as Auburn managed just 15 total yards in the first quarter. But the Tigers fought back, with quarterback Sean White completing 19 of 34 passes for 255 yards, with the help of six catches for 79 yards by Ricardo Louis and 122 rushing yards by Peyton Barber, who scored all three of Auburn's TDs in overtime. \nAllen threw for 233 yards and a three touchdowns for the Razorbacks, with Alex Collins adding 109 yards on the ground. \nArkansas had a scary moment, as running back Rawleigh Williams left in the second half with a neck injury. The team reported that Williams was moving all of his extremities. Rawleigh Williams suffered a neck injury & is moving all of his extremities. He & his family have been taken to a hospital for observation &mdash; Razorback Football (@RazorbackFB) October 24, 2015 \nThe win is Bielema's fourth SEC win in two and a half seasons as Arkansas' coach, and the Razorbacks now have some momentum going forward after the early losses to Toledo, Texas Tech and Texas A&M. They play Tennessee-Martin next week, and they'll then need to win two out of the final four against Ole Miss, LSU, Mississippi State and Missouri to qualify for the postseason. Auburn has a game against Idaho left but will need to beat Ole Miss, Texas A&M, Georgia or Alabama to get to six wins. Achieving that is not guaranteed for either team. \nThose aren't the stakes Arkansas or Auburn hoped for, but at least it's something to play for. This Arkansas/Auburn game would be an instant classic if either of these teams were any good &mdash; Chris B.
