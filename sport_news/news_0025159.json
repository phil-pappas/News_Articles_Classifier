Curry has found a way to be able to tackle his passion, football and family at the same time. He's the head coach of the Jaguars of the Venetia Athletic Club. The players ages range from 9- to 10-years-old. \nJacksonville's mayor is intense, competitive and always wants to win, but most importantly loves being able to be on the field with his only son Boyd, who is the team's quarterback. \n\"It's important to be with my son. It really is an escape. At this age you're on the field with them. You call the plays and then they go. I am completely detached from my cellphone, from the rest of the world,\" Curry said. \nHe admits that sometimes he and Boyd have their battles. \"There are also moments of tension between a father and son. He's more likely to listen to other people and I'm the head coach,\" he said. \nThe mayor is proud of his son and, like any proud father, he loves bragging about his boy. Curry played football as a young lad until he graduated high school. He says he has high expectations for his team, much like he has for the city of Jacksonville.
