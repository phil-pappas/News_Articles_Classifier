Even though the roster does not have to be set until 11 a.m. on Thursday, most of the decisions will likely be made at that meeting. \nSome of the discussion will surround the size of the pitching staff. For the regular season, there are usually five starters and seven relievers. For a short playoff series, that can be pared down to four starters and six or seven relievers. \n“I think 11 would be plenty,” Gibbons said. “You need four starters. So that would be 14 position players. I think that’s the way we’re approaching it. It’s pretty obvious. There’s not a whole lot of questions to answer. \nWho will comprise the bullpen is likely to be the big issue. With expanded rosters and starters going deep into games, some of the candidates have not had a lot of work. \n“A lot of those guys weren’t getting a lot of action there for a while,” Gibbons said. “(Latroy Hawkins) was down. It was basically (Mark) Lowe, (Aaron) Sanchez, (Brett) Cecil and (Roberto) Osuna going at it, almost day after day. Those other guys kind of got lost in the shuffle. There weren’t innings. They’ve sort of had a chance to pitch lately, but I think they’ve been a little bit off. That’s part of it too. We’ll see. I’d like to see Loup-y try to get some lefties out a little bit more. That would help.” \nprice won’t forget \nDavid Price and Gibbons are on the same page with respect to giving the ace lefty an 11-day rest before starting the playoff opener next Thursday. \n“I’m completely fine with it,” Price said. “The mound is still going to be 60 feet, six inches. That’s my greatest fear in the off-season is that I’ll forget how to throw. In 11 days, that’s not going to happen. I threw a live BP to (Troy Tulowitzki) today, and to (Matt) Hague and (Jonathan) Diaz. It went really well. I’ll be ready. \n“I didn’t go through the motions. I got after it and I felt good. That’s not why this is going on. If you can take some days off at the end of the season, it’s huge. Back in the day there were a lot of guys who would go on the phantom DL for two weeks. That’s not what this is. I’ll throw a bullpen in two or three days and then I’ll be ready for my start on Thursday.” \nFor Price, the season couldn’t have gone any better from a physical standpoint. \n“At this point in the year, this is the best I’ve felt for an entire season in my big league career,” he said. “I did not expect to feel as good now as I did in spring training and through the course of this season after the workload I had last year. \n“I felt good all year long and, you know, I’ll take these days.” \nPrice is very much in the Cy Young Award conversation and sitting out his last start may affect him in a negative way on that front. \n“I basically told him, hey, I’d rather you not (pitch),” Gibbons said. “He’s at 215 innings right now. In my mind, I thought we’d really like to see him win the Cy Young. But he said, ‘I don’t care about that anyway.’ That’s really what it came down to. He’s more concerned about this, which showed me something too. He totally understood it, otherwise he would have thrown that one inning yesterday in that slop if we hadn’t pitched the day before and he would have been banged anyway.” \nTIME TO EXHALE \nAfter eight seasons over two stints as manager of the Blue Jays, Gibbons finally is going to manage in post-season games. He was asked what Wednesday’s clinching celebration meant to him. \n“I was able to exhale a little bit,” he said. “A lot of satisfaction, because I mean really, it was a long time coming, but not just for me here. You look at the organization all those years and a lot of people have been around. I’m more happy for guys that have been around here forever that went through the lean years. I don’t put a whole lot of focus on myself. \n“Gratification and a lot of relief because we got there, man, we clinched this division. We didn’t want the wild card, we would have taken the wild card but we wanted the division and we won it. \n“I never wanted to be a guy either who just got a chance to manage in the big-leagues, you know? I wanted to be a guy who had a chance to win something.” \nAnd now he’s that guy.
