We can finish games a lot better.\" \nBut this offensive showcase will be hard to match. \nSudfeld produced the second-highest single-game yardage total in school history after convincing coach Kevin Wilson he was ready to return from an injured left ankle. \nThree receivers — Mitchell Paige, Ricky Jones and Simmie Cobbs Jr. — all caught at least six passes for more than 100 yards. Paige finished with 127, Jones had 119 and one touchdown Cobbs had 107 yards. \nRunning back Devine Redding scored twice and had a career high 99 yards, and Mike Majette carried 11 times for a career best 83 yards. \nAnd somehow, Indiana (4-3, 0-3) still couldn't avoid a third straight loss. \n\"I thought we got a little — I saw some things on the sideline that I didn't like,\" coach Kevin Wilson said. \"Saw some eyes and attitudes where I think we've got to stay humble and keep playing. We didn't, and they did.\" \nRutgers was rewarded after absorbing all those body blows for three quarters. \n\"We're relentless, we'll never give up and we have a lot of fight in this team,\" quarterback Chris Laviano said. \nEven when things looked bleak. \nFor the second time in 11 months, Rutgers (4-3, 1-2 Big Ten) rallied from 25 points down. They matched a school record that was set during a 41-38 victory at Maryland last November. \nBut this comeback seemed even more improbable after Indiana went 66 yards for a touchdown to make it a 52-27 lead with 5:25 left in the third quarter. \nSomehow, Rutgers' defense buckled down after allowing four straight touchdowns to start the second half, and the Hoosiers helped with three big mistakes that allowed the Scarlet Knights to pick themselves up off the mat. \nKemoko Turay scooped up a botched snap on a rare Indiana punt and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown to make it 52-39. \nRobert Martin converted Nate Sudfeld's first interception into a 3-yard TD run that made it 52-46. Paul James scored on a 40-yard TD run after Sudfeld's second interception to tie the score at 52 with 6:29 left. The extra point was blocked. \nLaviano closed it out by leading Rutgers on a final 59-yard drive to set up Federico for the winning kick and the knockout. \n\"There's no point in thinking about the last one when you've got one right in front of you that you've got to make,\" said Federico, who had two extra points blocked. \nThe final numbers resembled something out of a video game. \nIndiana and Rutgers combined for 1,223 yards of offense, 15 touchdowns and 43 plays of 10 or more yards. The 107 combined points were No. 2 all-time at Memorial Stadium. \nLaviano was 28 of 42 for a career-high 386 yards with three touchdowns and an interception. Leonte Carroo caught seven passes for a career-high 157 yards and three scores before leaving in the second half with an injured right foot or leg. His replacement Carlton Agudosi caught three passes for 72 yards. \nMartin ran 17 times for a career best 124 yards and a career high three TDs. \nAfter building a 17-7 lead early in the second quarter, then allowing Rutgers to retake the lead 27-24 in the final minute of the first half, Indiana scored four straight touchdowns to take the seemingly safe lead. \nBut Rutgers refused to go down and the Hoosiers early sideline celebration proved costly. \n\"It's adjustments, it's guys making plays,\" Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said. \"I think it's just a matter of continuing to compete and it's not easy to do. It takes tough-minded people, and I think we have that.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:45:12.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
