Tech upset No. 20 TCU, 20-10, the last time both teams met in Lubbock.\nHere are five things Texas Tech fans need to know about the Horned Frogs:\n1) TCU can run the score up. As evidenced by the 82-point performance last season, the Horned Frogs are capable of scoring in bunches. TCU is averaging 49.7 points per game this season - just enough for third place in the Big 12 - and led by senior quarterback Trevone Boykin, the Horned Frogs attack with a balanced offense that averages 231 rushing yards and 367.7 passing yards per game. The question is: will TCU head coach Gary Patterson find a way to neutralize the play of sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes, or will the Big 12's second-best scoring offense continue its explosive play?\n2) Trevone Boykin is a gamer. You don't become a Heisman-hopeful without turning a few heads and opening some eyes. The West Mesquite graduate is currently the Big 12's top quarterback talent and tied with Baker Mayfield for most touchdown passes (10) in the conference. Boykin's 985 passing yards rank eighth in FBS, two spots behind Mahomes and Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury continues to take notice. \"I was his biggest fan last year and I'm still his biggest fan,\" Kingsbury said during his weekly press conference. \"The way he extends plays for them, gives those guys an opportunity on the outside to get open and take shots and [is] just very elusive.\"\n3) Sonny leads the way. TCU co-offensive coordinator Sonny Cumbie returns to Lubbock for his first game against the Red Raiders in Jones AT&T Stadium. Cumbie joined Patterson's staff at TCU in 2014 as co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach and helped the Horned Frogs become the nation's most improved offense in total yards (+188 yards per game) and scoring (+21 points per game) in his first season. Boykin also earned Big 12 Offense Player of the Year and All-America honors with the help of the former Tech gunslinger. \"Obviously, coach [Sonny] Cumbie is a very good coach, played the position,\" Kingsbury said. \"We have a lot of similar thoughts and theories in the way we do things at that position, and he's done a great job over there.\"\n4) Patterson, not personnel makes the defense successful. When Tech faced Arkansas last week, it was conceivable that the Red Raiders were the better overall team after the Razorbacks lost multiple receiving targets and were already playing without running back Jonathan Williams. TCU has endured losses akin to Arkansas but despite the changes, Kingsbury believes Patterson rather than the personnel is what makes the Horned Frogs' defensive scheme flourish. \"I've always thought Gary Patterson was one of the top minds in the country,\" Kingsbury said. \"I know they've had some injuries, but you watch the film, and he has guys that they can plug in and they're making plays. They're always coached to do what they're supposed to do, so he's got them rolling right along.\"\n5) Special teams favor the Horned Frogs. Senior wide receiver Jakeem Grant ranks second in the Big 12 in all-purpose yards, averaging 175 yards per game, but if this game comes down to a field goal it favors TCU. Senior kicker and Arlington Martin graduate Jaden Oberkrom was first team All-Big 12 in 2014. Oberkrom made more than 81 percent of his field goal attempts last season and has missed one extra point dating back to his freshman year. Meanwhile, Texas Tech remains uncertain at the kicker position as freshmen Clayton Hatfield and Michael Barden each continue to get opportunities. Barden missed one of his three field goal attempts this season and Kingsbury says the team will continue to evaluate both kickers moving forward.\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_"], "published": "2015-09-24T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:59:09.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
