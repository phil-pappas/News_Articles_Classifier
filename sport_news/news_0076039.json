The zombies are back. As if they ever left. However, star Andrew Lincoln said that, in the sixth season, the zombies return to a bigger role than last season. \"The zombies are very much back in the foreground,\" he said.\n2. The humans remain a big threat, too. \"The Walking Dead\" is about people trying to survive in a zombie apocalypse. Over time, it's evolved from being about people trying to escape the undead to people trying to outlast others as civilization and order has crumbled around them.\n\"Emotionally, physically, everything is absolutely relentless,\" said actor Ross Marquand. \"They're dealing with the threats from all these different tribal factions that are trying to kill them. We're dealing with more and more zombies than ever before. It's just incredible.\"\n\"It was always going to be about how an environment changes people,\" Lincoln added. \"Some turn to the dark and some try and keep hope alive.\"\n3. It's not just a U.S. phenomenon. \"The Walking Dead\" is one of the most watched shows on television and has a global fan base.\n\"I'm from Zimbabwe,\" actress Danai Gurira said. \"People watch it there. I've been stopped on the streets of Zimbabwe for being Michonne so, it doesn't get more far away than that, you know? It's really exciting to see that my work in the United States is embraced by my other home that's so far away.\"\n4. Rain cannot stop the walkers. The red carpet itself was moved inside at the last minute Friday due to rain and wind, but that didn't keep away the fans, many who dressed as zombies, or \"walkers,\" as they're called on the series.", "external_links": ["http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead", "http://embed.newsinc.com/Single/iframe.html?WID=2&VID=29799173&freewheel=91223&sitesection=advance&height=349&width=620"], "published": "2015-10-10T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:09:37.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
