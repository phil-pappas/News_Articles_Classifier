After Wednesday’s matches each team in the Foothill League has played each other once. And in the final day of the first cycle of play, each of the matches brought us closer to how league will shake out. \nValencia 12, Hart 6 \nValencia and Hart have battled it out for the past three years to see which team would reign supreme as the league champion. They shared the title in 2012 and then passed it back-and-forth to each other the past two years. \nBut with Hart already taking a Foothill loss to West Ranch earlier this season, the matchup with Valencia would be crucial to where both Hart and Valencia would finish in the standings. \nBut unlike previous seasons, the Vikings were able to handle the Indians to remain undefeated in league play (5-0) and 11-2 overall. \nTwo of the Santa Clarita’s finest, Hart’s Natalia Munoz and Valencia’s Amanda Tabanera, battled it out until Munoz won with a 6-6 (8-6) tie break. Munoz swept all of her sets, getting 6-2 wins over Valencia’s Nos. 2 and 3 players, Jennifer Shin and Kate Zeile. \nNicole Alvarez took two of her three sets for the Indians. She was able to hold off Tabanera by a score of 6-4 and Zeile (6-1), but dropped her set to Shin 6-1. \nThe doubles side is where Valencia was able to create some separation. \nOther than Hart’s No. 1 doubles Cassidy Wilkinson and Alex LaForteza, who outlasted Valencia No. 1 doubles team Lauren Wolf and Gianna Benitez 6-2, the Vikings took eight out of nine sets from the Indians. \nWolf and Benitez took their next two sets by scores of 6-1 and 6-3. \nAnother clash on the courts ensued with Lopez and Mendez faced Valencia’s No. 2 double team Lindsey Gollom and Ahanti Bommireddipalli. The two teams also had to go to a tie break, this time in favor of a 10-8 win for the Vikings. \nWest Ranch 18, Golden Valley 0 \nAlthough West Ranch had the most lopsided victory over a conference opponent, it was one of the most telling. \nThe Wildcats’ No. 1 singles player Quinterra Walter-Eze won her only set of the match (6-0) before Julia Van der Colff subbed in and won her two sets 6-1, 6-0. \nWest Ranch’s No. 1 doubles team of Olivia Bloome and Brittany Waugh were perfect on the day, winning all three sets 6-0. \nWith the win, West Ranch moves to 6-2 overall and 4-1 in league. The only loss the Wildcats have suffered was at the hands of the defending champs. \nBut West Ranch will get its chance to avenge that loss when it faces Valencia today. \nCanyon 9 (72 games), Saugus 9 (62 games) \nIn the closest match of the day ,Canyon and Saugus tied 9-9 in sets, but it was the Cowboys that won 72-62 in games. \nCanyon relied heavily on its singles, which won seven of its nine sets. Canyon senior and No. 1 singles player Katrina DeGuzman took all three of her sets 6-0 over Saugus. \nThe Cowboys Nos. 2 and 3 singles, Amanda Yeam and Natalie Tseng, each dropped a set to Centurions’ No. 1 singles Allison Hall (6-3 and 6-2, respectively) but took their other two sets. \nThe Saugus No. 1 doubles team of Carlie Ozaki and Megan Cho swept their three sets for the Cents, 6-0, 6-4 and 6-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:46:19.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
