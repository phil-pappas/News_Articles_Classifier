The results so far have been disappointing really. \n“But you can’t be flying high all the time. So I believe they’ll bounce back and still be title contenders.” \nMIKEL OBI AT CHELSEA \n“Our brother Mikel Obi is a great player. I wish he would get more playing time. Since that’s not happening in Chelsea, I feel he should go elsewhere and play. \n“Mikel is currently one of our most celebrated players in the Super Eagles. I feel really bad seeing him on the bench all the time. \n“Its’ not good for the image of Nigerian football. He should be playing regular football.” \nDIEGO COSTA“Diego Costa is a great player but I think he has a temper problem which he needs to work on. \n“We need him (Costa) to play constantly, that’s what he’s paid for. Not to be banned all the time.” \nJOSE MOURINHO“We have a great coach, Jose Mourinho, and good players as well. Jose is going through a bad period but its only normal to experience setbacks in life, that’s what makes us human.” \nWATCHING CHELSEA GAMES“Its not easy though. But when I’m free I watch their matches. I don’t get to watch all Chelsea games because of my schedule. Sometimes I watch only their highlights.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:39:48.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
