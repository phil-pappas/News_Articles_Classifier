(AP) — Julio Jones has opened the week on the practice field instead of in the trainer’s room. \nA healthy Jones is the first sign that three straight off days could move the Atlanta Falcons closer to full strength for Sunday’s game at Tennessee. \nThe Falcons are hoping to have starting center Mike Person (ankle) and linebacker Justin Durant (elbow) back this week. Person and Durant worked on the side in Monday’s practice after missing Thursday night’s 31-21 loss at New Orleans. \nCoach Dan Quinn says he hopes Person and Durant can practice on Wednesday. \nJones has played in every game despite missing some practices the last four weeks with toe and hamstring injuries. The star receiver missed last week’s first practice. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:18:15.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
