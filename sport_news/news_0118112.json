Photo by Josh Albelda, ABS-CBN Sports \nMANILA - With Paul Lee in street clothes and their top rookie having a forgettable debut, it was easy to question how Rain or Shine would match up with reinvigorated Star in the 2015 PBA Philippine Cup. \nThey needed three quarters to do so, but the Elasto Painters’ other battle-tested veterans had more than enough to overcome the younger Hotshots, 96-87, on Wednesday at the MOA Arena. \nWithout their top gun, the Painters had trouble getting their offense going and were outran by Star en route to a tally of 68-61 late in the third. It was at that point that JR Quinahan powered a 14-7 charge that knotted the game at 75 at the 8:17 mark of the fourth. \nBack-to-back hits by Jericho Cruz gave Rain or Shine their first taste of the lead which all of a sudden ballooned to as much as 92-81 with two minutes remaining. The Hotshots only managed to trade baskets the rest of the way. \nAfter surrendering more than 21 points in the first three periods, the Painters only allowed 17 in the final frame to claim a season-opening victory. “It was an ugly win. We just tried to be patient and our patience paid off,” coach Yeng Guiao said in his post-game conference. \nQuinahan and Cruz finished with 17 and 15 points, respectively, to show the way for Rain or Shine who will be without Lee for four weeks due to a left knee injury. “We’ll try to make it sooner, but we’re not gonna force the issue,” Guiao said of his top gun. \nStar had five players in double-digits, but simply ran out of gas late in Jason Webb’s first game as head coach. \nBOX SCORES \nRAIN OR SHINE 96 - Quinahan 17, Cruz 15, Belga 11, Almazan 9, Norwood 9, Chan 8, Tiu 7, Ponferada 6, Ibanes 4, Teng 4, Ahanmisi 3, Matias 3, Trollano 0. \nSTAR 87 - Barroca 15, Mallari 15, Yap 15, Sangalang 13, Simon 11, Pingris 8, Torres 5, Maliksi 2, Melton 2, Reavis 1, Gaco 0, Pascual J. 0. \nThis story was originally published on the ABS-CBN Sports website. \nFor more sports coverage, visit ABS-CBN Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:57:14.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
