But the main event was the evening's ball, where the finest formal wear from across the centuries flounced as the wearers learned an English country dance.\nAmong those reveling in their retro regalia throughout the day were Sarah and Gabriel Chrisman, the Washington couple that's caught the nation's attention in recent years for attempting to live as though it was still the Victorian era . Sarah Chrisman was the event's keynote speaker earlier in the evening.\nThough the couple had to leave the festivities before the ball, organizer Kay Demlow said the Chrismans were kindred spirits among the other anachronists in attendance. And it's this costumed camaraderie that brings Joe Christensen, a steelworker from Beaverton, to the ball.\n\"Nobody's mocking anybody\" for their occasionally outlandish dress, he said. Everyone buys in and stays open to the experience, which makes for an irresistible atmosphere for Christensen and his wife, Roberta.\nAnd by the looks of everyone else at the ball, there was no place - or time - they'd have rather been either.\n-- Dillon Pilorget\ndpilorget@oregonian.com\n503-294-5927\n@ForestGReporter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/forestgreporter", "http://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9275611/victorian-era-life", "http://www.timetravelersball.com/"], "published": "2015-10-11T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:20:02.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
