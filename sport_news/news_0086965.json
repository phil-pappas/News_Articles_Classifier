Watch the KSL Game Night Live game of the week through the video player above, or at live.ksl.com . \nSky View is ranked No. 4 in the state in the latest Deseret News high school football rankings, but the Mustangs are right behind, at No. 6. Both teams are 5-0 in region play and guaranteed a top-two seed in the playoffs. The game is the first in both school's histories where both teams are undefeated in the matchup. \nThe winner will host Syracuse, the No. 4 seed from Region 2, while the loser hosts the same region's No. 3 seed, Viewmont.
