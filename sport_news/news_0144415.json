That new bunch includes highly touted newcomers Corey Sanders and DeShawn Freeman.\n“We have great competition at every position, so from that standpoint it’s encouraging,” Jordan said on the eve of the Scarlet Knights’ opening practice Friday.\nHere’s what else Jordan had to say about his 2015-16 squad:\nQ. What’s your general impression based on preseason workouts?\nA. Our talent base has a little bit more depth, and we’re a little more athletic than last year. We play hard — everybody plays hard. Everybody. We play above the rim at every position.\nBut the youth quotient will make a difference. We have to learn how to play with pace, how to take care of the ball. We have great competition at every position, so from that standpoint it’s encouraging.\nQ. For the players who return, what did they learn from last year?\nA. I’m not thinking about how it ended. I don’t think about whatever they call it, the streak. I hope guys who came back understand that it’s fragile. I don’t know what it meant, having the best win in school history (over No. 4 Wisconsin) and then doing what we did. I do know there’s a lesson in there, and most of that lesson is you don’t go and hide. You have to keep going.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:05:26.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
