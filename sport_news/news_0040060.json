After two games with Lucas as the primary guy, two with Waddle as the main option and another with them splitting, it's still unclear what the Lions' best option is at the position.\n\"It'd be better just as far as having a guy in there and knowing that's the guy who's going to stay in there and be in the whole time,\" Waddle said of the rotation. \"But until that's kind of set in stone, that's just the way we're going to do it.\"\nNo matter which player is in the game, it's clear the Lions need better play from the right tackle spot as the duo has allowed a combined 23 quarterback pressures.\n\"I think any option — Waddle being at right, me being at right — whoever's in there has to take care of responsibilities,\" Lucas said. \"That's it, plug and play.\"\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Waddle ranks 73rd of 76 tackles who have played at least 25 percent of their offense's snaps.\n\"I've just got to play better, plain and simple,\" said Waddle, an undrafted free agent in 2013.\nDETROIT NEWS\nLions dismiss report Caldwell has lost respect of players\nLucas, who went undrafted in 2014, isn't faring much better at 60th. Overall, the Lions offensive line has performed poorly. There has been progress the last couple games, but the run game still ranks last in the NFL.\nAnd at right tackle, Waddle said the coaches haven't said what either player has to do to secure the job permanently.\n\"Pretty much just prove it on the field,\" he said. \"That's what it's going to come down to.\"\nThus far, Pro Football Focus has graded Waddle as the better run blocker and Lucas as the better pass blocker. Lucas has improved his overall grade each of the past three games, including a positive one in Week 5, while Waddle has improved each of the last two.\nBoth Lucas and Waddle acknowledged the importance of continuity along the offensive line, and the team has tried to work on developing chemistry — with both right guards Larry Warford and Manny Ramirez — in practice.\n\"I think the guys, they both have a feel for me and (Lucas) and just how we play,\" Waddle said. \"I think we get enough reps to where it's not that big of an issue, I don't think.\"\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:48:11.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
