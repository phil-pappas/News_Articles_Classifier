That even includes a significant chunk of people who have never smoked up.\n“They’re really looking at the situation almost in the same way that you look at taxes and gambling. Even if you’re not gambling… you still see some benefits from having other people spend their money that way,” says Mario Canseco with Insights West.\n“It’s a similar issue with the alcohol taxes. Maybe you don’t like scotch, but if somebody’s paying… to get some of that tax revenue, it makes sense. I think this is one of the reasons for the support.”\nThe Liberals and Green Party back legalization and the NDP supports decriminalization, while the Conservatives want to keep pot illegal.\nRelated Stories Pot summit in Vancouver aims to help businesses navigate uncertain climate Marijuana could be an 'exit' drug: research Insights West | marijuana", "external_links": ["http://www.insightswest.com/news/users-and-non-users-across-canada-support-marijuana-legalization/"], "published": "2015-10-01T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:03:41.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
