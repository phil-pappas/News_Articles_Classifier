Elijah’s played really well.”\nJazz coach Quin Snyder\nSALT LAKE CITY — Quin Snyder wants Elijah Millsap to improve. He demands it. He’s even gotten on the shooting guard pretty good for some offensive struggles Paul’s little brother had with the Utah Jazz last season.\nThat said, Snyder vehemently denied an ESPN report that claimed the coaching staff has lost trust in Millsap and that the second-year NBA player is now considered a longshot to make the Jazz’s regular season roster.\nHearing about the report took Snyder by surprise.\n“It’s totally false. Elijah’s played really well,” Snyder said after Thursday's practice. “I talked to Elijah once a week all summer. (Assistant) Brad Jones flew out to see him. That’s his (ESPN writer Kevin Pelton’s) opinion. I don’t even know what to (say). Ask Elijah how he feels about me and go from there.”\nThe Jazz do have a crowd of players in Millsap’s position with Alec Burks, Rodney Hood and Joe Ingles all expected to see time at shooting guard this season.\nBut Snyder loves the defensive intensity, the offensive potential and the work ethic Millsap has shown.\nThe second-year coach also likes the progress Millsap seems to have made on offense, especially with situational awareness, over the offseason.\n“He’s been making better decisions. He’s shooting the ball. He’s always shot it pretty well with his feet set,” Snyder said. “There was a point last year when he was leading us in 3-point percentage for a couple of weeks. The thing he’s been doing is making better decisions with the ball like when to pass, when to shoot on his drives. He’s been good. He’s played well.”\nSnyder pointed out that Millsap immediately recognized one play when he should’ve passed it to a teammate for a corner 3. He likes that he’s thinking about things like that more now.\n“If he can be efficient like that offensively,” Snyder added, “that’s when his defense becomes even more valuable.”\nA GAMING HERO: Gordon Hayward’s love for video games has been covered extensively throughout his NBA career, and he put his passion to good use Thursday morning. A day after Fox Sports radio host Colin Cowherd poked fun of eSports and professional gamers, Hayward accepted an invitation to defend his hobby on national radio.\n“I think it was just one of those things where it was all in good fun,” Hayward said. “I had to go on the show and set him straight, for sure. He was saying some ridiculous things.”\nFIRST WEEK: Rookie power forward Trey Lyles has been holding his own in practice so far, according to Snyder and Hayward.\n“He’s done a good job coming out and being really aggressive. He hasn’t shied away from any looks,” Hayward said. “I think he’s really working hard and competing, which is what you want to ask from all of the rookies.”\nSnyder credited Lyles for playing with focus, desire and an evolving pride on defense.\n“I think that’s from being around some of the other guys. It’s going to take time to get used to the physicality. It’s just different,” Snyder said. “He’s easy to play with. He makes the right play. He does things that are hard to teach.”\nLyles said it helped that he showed up to train with his new teammates three weeks before training camp began.\n“(I’m) playing against grown men now, 27, 28 years old. That’s different than playing against college guys,” he said. “It’s definitely something I’ve had to adjust to and I think that it’s going well right now.”\nCONCUSSION: Jazz small forward Chris Johnson suffered a concussion after taking an elbow to the head in Wednesday night’s practice. He did not participate in Thursday’s practice and will have to pass the NBA’s concussion protocol, which includes a series of tests, before returning to action.\nJAZZ NOTES: Utah will fly out to Hawaii after Friday morning’s practice for preseason games Sunday and Tuesday against the Lakers. Both contests will be televised on ROOT Sports. Sunday’s game will also be on NBA-TV.  Snyder is looking forward to seeing how his team responds to being in an exotic place like Hawaii for nearly a week. Many players will have family members with them for a working vacation. The coach hopes his team can learn to prioritize and bond. “I’m not saying Gordon and Fav ( Derrick Favors ) have to go for a long swim to together to bond,” he joked. “But I would like to see Alec ( Burks ) hula.”  Snyder said Hayward, Favors and Rudy Gobert will be in his starting lineup, but he hasn’t announced which guards will start yet.  Snyder complimented Hayward for consistently working hard this week, but credited Favors for practicing “maybe harder than anyone.” Snyder on Favors: “He’s given so much effort and he’s been so precise. There’s clearly a level of concentration that he’s had.”\nEMAIL: jody@desnews.com\nTWITTER: DJJazzyJody", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:23:30.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
