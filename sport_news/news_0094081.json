Posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 3:15 am | Updated: 9:41 pm, Fri Oct 23, 2015. Adding on to history By PAUL BOGGS Sports Editor The Jackson County Times-Journal \nIt wasn’t quite the drama of the past two sectional championships for the Jackson High School girls soccer squad. \nThat didn’t mean it wasn’t any more nerve-wracking — or any less rewarding. \nIn fact, just knowing the nemesis the Ironladies defeated Thursday was gratifying enough. \nThat’s because, for only the second time in the program’s 15-year history, the Ironladies tamed the Marietta Tigers and — once again — a sectional championship was at stake. \nOn Thursday, inside a sun-soaked yet anxious Alumni Stadium, host Jackson got the game’s only goal with 33 minutes remaining — and held on to edge the pesky Tigers 1-0. \nAmelia Davis got that only goal, scoring off an assist from senior Allie Morris, one of eight Ironladies playing their final match in Alumni Stadium. \nMarietta mounted furious offensive challenges for the final 25 minutes, and collected five corner kicks, but the mad scrambles in front of the net never made it into the strings. \nThe Ironladies are now 13-2-3, as Thursday’s win was their fifth straight shutout and 11th of the season, including two scoreless ties. \n“The girls have done really well again this year. They’ve adapted well and have played really well without (injured forward) Katie (Exline) the last two weeks. We graduated (2014 Division II Southeast District Player of the Year) Peyton (Miller) and have played a lot this year without Katie. Last year, Peyton and Katie were two of the top three players in the (Division II) district and both made the all-state team. When you lose two major players like that in less than a year, it’s a good chance for the rest of the girls to show that we’re not just based off of two well-known players,” said Jackson coach Chris Skarratt. “The girls have stepped up and have shown they are able to do it. They won the league (Southeastern Ohio Athletic League), and now they’ve won tonight against a good strong Marietta team. It shows the girls that we’re not just a one-woman team. It’s going to build confidence and that’s what we want.” \nWith Thursday’s win, second-seeded Jackson captures a second straight Division II sectional crown, and only its fourth in program history. \nThe others were as a Division II team in 2004, and exactly nine years and one day (Oct. 21, 2006) since they clipped the Tigers in a Division I tilt. \nThat day in Alumni Stadium was similar to Thursday, although Jackson needed two overtimes AND two shootouts to win that epic affair. \nLast year, the top-seeded Ironladies fell behind to Warren 1-0, then got the game-tying goal on a Peyton Miller direct kick with eight minutes and 11 seconds left in regulation. \nThen, only two minutes and 51 seconds into overtime, Abby Waugh was the hero by heading in a Miller corner kick. \nThis year, it was Davis delivering the title-clinching point, as Jackson’s senior-laden defensive back line denied the third-seed Tigers all match. \nWith senior standout goal-scorer Katie Exline injured and out of action, the Ironlady defense has further ratcheted up its play. \nExline is the Ironladies’ all-time career goals leader with 99, including 27 this season before her ankle injury five games ago. \n“We’ve only conceded three goals over our last 10 games now,” said Skarratt. “When we had Katie and we were scoring a lot of goals, that was great, but defense is what wins championships in America.” \nSkarratt said with the return of the anchor Waugh to the back line, along with fellow seniors Abby Van Allen and Brooke Hughes and sophomore midfielder Mika Johnson, the Ironladies’ defense is absolutely “solid”. \n“I think it’s more re-assurance that she (Waugh) is there. With Abby and Abby Van Allen and Brooke (Hughes) back there, we’ve been solid. The girls have been brilliant and they work very hard,” he said. \nThe Ironladies had to work with the 1-0 lead, as Amelia Bragg’s direct kick that was snagged by Marietta goalkeeper Brookelyn Heiss with 26:45 left was Jackson’s last best shot. \nFrom the 21:25 mark until the final three minutes, the Tigers amassed at least four corner kicks, with Jackson keeper Sarah Balzer making one save and the Ironladies —as a team — recording another. \nMarietta only had five total shots, including a missed direct kick with 5:40 to play — and a wide-left attempt earlier in the half by Lexie Mullen. \nSkarratt said the Ironladies’ final 25 minutes against Marietta was similar to its second-half scoreless tie against Athens. \n“We panicked a little bit again like we did against Athens. I don’t understand why, but we do it to ourselves. We score a goal and we sort of sit back a little bit. They (Tigers) kept pressuring and stepped up and we just kept kicking it (the ball) and couldn’t get out of our own (defensive) half,” said the coach. “But the girls held strong. We just need to not panic. I know that’s easier said than done. But they did the job. After all, it’s win and go through.” \nThe Ironladies didn’t score for the first 47 minutes, but they maintained most of the first-half possession, kept the ball in their offensive half, and matched Marietta’s patented physicality. \nJackson had 11 shots, including five on goal, as Morris and Davis — within four minutes of each other — couldn’t connect on excellent scoring chances. \nHeiss had four saves for the Tigers, but she kept charging up to the top of the goalbox. \nThe Red and White were unable to take advantage. \n“We could have killed the game off in the first half to be totally honest with you, but we never hit the target with a shot. We never really tested the goalkeeper in the first half. We talked about that at halftime. We had to test the keeper because she (Heiss) kept on rushing out. We nearly caught her off her line in the first minute,” said Skarratt. \nFinally, exactly six minutes and 56 seconds into the second half, Jackson got its goal. \nOperating in the midfield, Bragg held the ball and passed to Morris on the right, who outmuscled her defender and crossed the ball to Davis down the center. \nDavis dribbled slightly to pull Heiss up, and headed the ball into the center of the twine for the 1-0 lead. \n“It was a great ball by Allie Morris into the box and a really brave header by Amelia Davis,” said Skarratt. “With that ball there, it was in absolutely ideal place. Amelia Bragg had a good first touch out wide to Allie, who made a great cross from the right. Then Amelia Davis was really brave to get a head on that ball for the goal. In her eyesight, she could probably see the keeper (Heiss) coming out. And Amelia, with her size, she doesn’t score that many heady goals. But she put it where it needed to be. It’s great for her confidence.” \nDavis’ goal was actually the only one that counted, as the Tigers — with a minute-and-a-half left in the first half — had a Mullen goal negated by an offsides. \nThe Tigers finish the season at 11-6-1, while the Ironladies advance to Thursday night’s Division II district semifinals against Chillicothe. \nKickoff is set for 7 p.m., and will be played inside sparkling Logan Chieftain Stadium. \nIn the Ironladies’ regular-season meeting against Chillicothe, on Oct. 3 at home, Jackson led 1-0 and 2-1 before the match eventually ended in a 2-2 draw. \nIn fact, Exline had both of the Ironladies’ goals. \nOn Thursday (Oct. 29), the match will not end in a tie, and Exline’s status is still uncertain. \nStill, the Ironladies are absolutely interested in adding on to history. \nThey wrote another chapter on Thursday, with the fresh thought now to win a first-ever district match. \n“We were leading twice against Chillicothe (1-0 and 2-1) and we know them well. They have a very good coach (Zach Breth). Zach is very good and he teaches them (Cavaliers) the right way. They are going to play some very good soccer against us, but we just have to be more organized than we were today and not panic,” said Skarratt. “But we will be ready and prepared and see how it goes.” * * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:49:38.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
