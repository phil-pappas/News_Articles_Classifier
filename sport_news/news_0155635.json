Lacey Peterson / Union Democrat, copyright 2015 The Tuolumne County History Center and Museum will host a free family and history oriented harvest festival Oct. 10. \nThe event will be held from 1 to 5 p.m. in the Tuolumne County Museum courtyard at 158 Bradford St. in Sonora. \nThe festival will feature a display of gold pans from the museum’s 2015 Panning for History countywide gold pan art contest. At 3 p.m., there will be an award’s ceremony for the contest winners in various categories. About 200 people, children and adults, participated in the contest. \nThe event will include Gold Rush-era games, including Hardluck Lin’s “shut the box” game, jacks, and bubbles on a string, said Sarge Furman, from the museum’s board of governors. \nThere will also be showings of the Tuolumne County Historical Society’s 30-minute film on Tuolumne County’s filmmaking heyday. There also will be lessons on how to pan for gold. \nAlice Kraus, an expert in mid-1800s quilts, will bring her collection of quilts to display. \nFran Azevedo Gardner, who grew up in Tuttletown, will bring her father’s childhood wagon to display. Her dad, Joe Azevedo, was the first president of the Tuolumne County Historical Society. \nThere will be photo opportunities at each exhibit, and people can have their pictures put on a poster, Furman said. \nAt 2 p.m., Sonora City Historian Pat Perry will give a tour of the Jewish Cemetery near the museum. \nThere will also be lemonade and cookies. \n“There should be something for everybody,” Furman said. \nFor more information, call the History Center at 532-4227.
