(Reggie) Ragland is all over the place. He gets them lined up. Just a heck of a linebacker that is really kind of the leader. A lot of NFL players on this field.” \nSumlin and Texas A&M (5-0, 2-0 SEC) get their shot at Alabama (5-1, 2-1 SEC) on Saturday in College Station at 2:30 p.m. on CBS. \nSumlin said the first stat that jumps out is how Alabama’s defense leads the country in three-and-outs. Alabama’s defense has forced 29 three-and-outs in the past three games to move the unit into a tie for first place nationally at 6.83 per game (tied with Marshall). On the season, Alabama has forced a three-and-out on 41-of-92 drives (44.6 percent), including 29-of-48 in the past three games (60.4 percent). \n“The first thing you better do is get a first down instead of worrying about the other part of it,” Sumlin said. “They’ve been very, very stout. Kirby Smart does a great job. They’re well coached. They know what they are doing. They’re aggressive, and they’re hard to move up front. It’s status quo for an Alabama defense. \n“I think one of their players said they’re the best defense in the country. It’s hard to argue that they’re not.” \nTexas A&M offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Jake Spavital said the key will be to get creative when attacking Alabama’s defensive front so the offense can have balance. Spavital said Alabama’s front is “probably one of the best in the country” and that the Aggies know the task at hand. \n“We have to find ways, unique ways, to (run) the ball if it’s on the perimeter or if it’s running up the middle, but we have to be a little more innovative than what we’ve had,” Spavital said. “I think the plan that (Offensive line/run game coordinator) coach (Dave) Christensen’s got in the run game is going to be pretty good versus these guys.” \nTexas A&M is seventh in the SEC with an average of 188 yards per game (4.72 yards per carry). \nAlabama is holding opponents to 77.33 yards per game and 2.61 yards per carry. Both of those are No. 1 in the SEC and rank No. 4 and No. 5 in the nation, respectively. \nSumlin said he and the team stressed the importance of being physical to the players all offseason. Sumlin noted the Aggies last two games – Arkansas and Mississippi State – as two contests that were “extremely physical” while adding that he thought the players “handled it a lot better this year” than a year ago, particularly the Mississippi State game, when it comes to the physicality of Texas A&M’s running game. \n“That’s where this league is. Our goal is to do that,” Sumlin said. “I don’t know how you’d rate them. But are we more physical? Yes. Are we better? Yes. How much? I guess we’ll find out Saturday.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1Ltds8i TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:31:17.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
