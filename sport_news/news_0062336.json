That contest leaps out from the quartet of clashes between teams from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres this weekend. Ireland will play Argentina in Cardiff on Sunday while Twickenham, England, hosts Wales versus South Africa on Saturday, and Scotland against Australia the following evening. France was propelled into the path of the favorites when it lost 24-9 to Ireland in Cardiff on Sunday. The Irish undoubtedly have the better team, but there is little doubt New Zealand would rather have played them. No matter that this is a distinctly ordinary French team. So, too, was the team of 2007 that ambushed the All Blacks at the same stage on the same Cardiff field, the 1999 vintage that sank the Kiwis in the semifinal and even that of 2011, which pushed New Zealand all the way in the final, losing by the slimmest of margins, 8-7 . France spooks New Zealand like no other team. It is the one team in the world that might believe it has a better chance against the All Blacks than against Argentina. “Today Ireland deserved to win. We don’t have the choice so we have to play New Zealand,” was French Coach Philippe Saint-André’s good-humored response when it was suggested Sunday night that he might not have minded losing to Ireland. “We know it is a tough game, but we are not out of the competition. We need to stick together, and to play much better than we did today.” Ireland is the one European team that will be favored against a Southern Hemisphere team. Scotland seems unlikely to trouble Australia, while battered Wales — which had a seventh back, Liam Williams, ruled out of the tournament Sunday — must face the unrestrained physicality of South Africa. But Ireland is warily respectful of Argentina. “The big attraction of playing Argentina is the seven-day turnaround, not because we want to play them,” said Ireland Coach Joe Schmidt. “They will challenge us immensely.” Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium — soon to be renamed Principality Stadium — is a home away from home for the Irish. Ireland has a 6-3 record there against Wales, and the venue has hosted some of the greatest European triumphs of Irish provincial teams. On Sunday night, the green-clad hordes in a crowd of 72,000 created what its stand-in captain Jamie Heaslip, a big game veteran, reckoned was “an atmosphere which surpassed pretty much anything I’ve played in.” Ireland, though, like Wales, is seriously banged up. It lost three key players — its inspirational lock forward and captain Paul O’Connell, the midfield playmaker Jonny Sexton and back-row forward Peter O’Mahony — to injuries during the victory over France. Another back-row forward, Sean O’Brien, is likely to be disciplined for punching a French player. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:43:14.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
