Hopefully we get the one we've tentatively chosen, I think you put three down and hopefully get the one you want.\" \nNow that he knows Northern Ireland will not be involved in a play-off next month - which was actually the manager's stated ambition at the outset of the campaign - O'Neill is hoping to schedule a Windsor Park friendly in the next international break. \n\"We'll hopefully have a game in November, a home game,\" he said. \n\"That's in the pipeline at the moment and it will probably just be one because it's maybe important not to keep the players too long away from their clubs.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:00:36.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
