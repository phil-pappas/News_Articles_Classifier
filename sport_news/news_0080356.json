Some jawing and shoving followed. Wunderlich, a freshman at the time, was caught in the middle of the scrum and subsequently ejected.\n\"So I really didn’t get to be a part of it at all,” the Memphis University School graduate said.\nThat's one of the reasons why Wunderlich is so excited for Saturday's game at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium. He wouldn't necessarily call it a homecoming, because his home is so close, geographically, to where he now takes classes. But it will be \"special\" nonetheless, he said.\n\"I remember I guess probably 10 years or so ago, going to the Liberty Bowl and watching the Ole Miss-Memphis game, it being a big rivalry, a close game,\" Wunderlich said. \"So it’s definitely going to be a fun weekend in Memphis for everybody.”\nWunderlich was a first-team All-State and Best of the Preps selection at MUS and graduated as the top-ranked kicking prospect in the Class of 2014, according to Rivals.com. He made six of eight field goal attempts as a freshman and also punted 10 times with an average of 45.2 yards. This season, he has converted eight of 10 field goals, with a long of 45 yards.\nWunderlich is one of 11 Rebels from the greater Memphis area, a group that also includes running backs Jaylen Walton (Ridgeway) and Jordan Wilkins (St. Benedict) and offensive lineman Ben Still (MUS). Though he grew up a Virginia fan, and only paid occasional attention to Memphis football, Wunderlich has been impressed with how drastically the program has improved in recent years.\n\"That’s a quick turnaround. I think they didn’t win any games or something a few years ago,\" he said. \"Coach (Justin) Fuente’s done a really good job up there, and they’ve got a really good team that, if we don’t show up, could easily beat us next week.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkCtBW3FWVk"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:33:29.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
