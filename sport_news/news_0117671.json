Not only was Hamilton ejected, but it pushed Alabama back considerably. \nIt was the first ejection of the year for Alabama. As Hamilton jogged off the field, he waved his hands in the air, encouraging the crowd to cheer. \nThe penalty occurred when Alabama was up 28-6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:30:37.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
