While they warn that even full-grown cats can be hard to find, they suggest searching for the kittens' mother, Peggy, as her wispy-eared babies tend to stay close by.\nKeepers added the best time to see the pair is when they're released around 10 a.m.\nThe kittens -- Nandi (male) and Nisha (female) -- weigh about 2 to 3 pounds, slightly larger than domestic kittens. Caracals typically live in the woodlands and savannas of North Africa, Southwest Asia and the Arabian Peninsula\n\"Peggy's been an excellent and very attentive mother,\" said Foster, going on to mention the kittens' \"chirping\" sound when they want their mother.\n\"When her little ones call,\" she said, \"she comes right away to check on them.\"\nWant to visit?\nThe zoo is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily. It is located in Portland off U.S. 26 at 4001 S.W. Canyon Road.\nAdmission is $11.50 (ages 12-64), $10 for seniors (65 and older), $8.50 for children (ages 3-11) and free for those 2 and younger.
