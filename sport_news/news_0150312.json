For just the third time this year the Ignacio Bobcats felt the uneasy feeling of a loss which from the hands of the Centauri Falcons falling in five sets 27-25, 20-25, 25-20, 22-25 and 15-10. Ignacio (9-3, 6-0) was playing without one of its most crucial elements, sophomore setter Shoshone Thompson. Thompson was ruled ineligable due to a concussion she sustained against Dolores High School on Oct. 3. Centuari (10-5, 1-2) won the first game in a back-and-forth match that saw Centauri blow a 6-1 lead to let Ignacio back in the match. Centauri ultimately won the first set, but Ignacio came back and took the second set. “The whole match was very close, very amazing,” Ignacio head coach Thaddeus Cano said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “The girls performed well with what we had.” What the Bobcats had was solid play from junior Alex Forsythe, who filled in for the injured Thompson, finished the game with 15 assists. Seniors Miel Diaz and Ellie Seibel both had six kills each, and sophomore Avionne Gomez saw some time on the court due to Thompson’s injury as she finished with five kills. What the Bobcats didn’t have was Thompson’s prowess. She led the 2A/1A San Juan Basin league in service aces with 52 and was second in the league with 212 assists before sustaining a concussion. “Not having her was huge,” Cano said. “She’s our toughest server and we average 20 points with her. It was very huge without her. Things would have been different.” According to Cano, Thompson will undergo further concussion reviews before she is given the go-ahead for Ignacio’s next game against Ridgway, which is a home league match at 11 a.m. on Saturday at Ignacio’s gym.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:52:10.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
