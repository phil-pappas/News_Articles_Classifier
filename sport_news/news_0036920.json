They were also missing three starters on the offensive line that night. Two are back. \n\"I've never had a layoff this long,\" said coach Andy Talley. \"Traditionally, when we've had a layoff, we've usually come back strong. If you have two weeks to get ready, you should do a really good job of preparation. \n\"The only negative is you could get stale, lose game speed playing against scout-team guys. Other than that, I think it's much more of a plus to have that (extra time). Especially where we were with the injuries. We needed time. The loss to Penn was deflating. But we've had really good practices.\" \nThe Tribe lost last week at Delaware by one, on a field goal as time expired, after leading by nine midway through the fourth quarter. Their other loss was by six on Sept. 19 at Virginia. Villanova beat Delaware by seven that day, after Robertson got hurt late. Redshirt freshman Zach Bednarczyk came in and passed for a touchdown before scrambling for the winning score. \n\"We have a lot of belief in Zach,\" Talley said. \"He can run and throw. We didn't run him against Penn because we didn't have a backup quarterback (now it's true freshman Adeyemi DaSilva). So we need to get him running (too). That's fixable. \n\"Anytime you lose three (linemen), that's not a good deal. We're patched up a little bit there. That should help. Now we have to see if we can come back and step it up and get after it. We've had time to stew about (what happened), get over it. We really need to play, see if we can come out of our malaise.\" \nOr else they'll be running out of lifelines. \nOn Twitter: @mikekerndn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:52:05.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
