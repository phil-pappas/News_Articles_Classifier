Until December 2013, only Arizona Army National Guard members, the base’s civilian employees, and a small number of other hunters were allowed to hunt on the 28,442-acre facility, part of Game Management Unit 6B. \nThrough an agreement between the department and AZDEMA, hunting opportunities on Camp Navajo were expanded to include uniformed service members and honorably retired veterans from all military branches, disabled veterans and Wounded Warriors. There also are more equitable and impartial opportunities for civilian hunters. \n“The Camp Navajo hunt rules do an outstanding job of honoring the service and sacrifice of the men and women of our nation’s armed forces, in balance with reasonable opportunities for civilians to enjoy hunting on the base under the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation,” said Craig McMullen, regional supervisor for the department’s office in Flagstaff. \nIn 2014, the distribution of 155 permit-tags for elk was established as follows: 12 for Wounded Warriors, 25 for disabled veterans, 88 for military and 30 for “other” (all eligible applicants including civilians, military, disabled veterans, Wounded Warriors, Arizona Army National Guard members, and any other applicant who is eligible to hunt in Arizona). \nThe department coordinated with Camp Navajo prior to recommending elk permit-tag numbers for fall 2015 hunts. The conclusion was that an increase of 45 permit-tags (200 total), with a slightly higher number of permit-tags being made available to civilians, would be acceptable. \n“Camp Navajo’s hunting program supports the Arizona Army National Guard’s training mission by helping the Arizona Game and Fish Department manage a healthy wildlife population,” said Lt. Col. Anita Vinson, garrison commander of Camp Navajo. “Our partnership with AZGFD ensures a fair system of permit-tag distribution among service members, veterans and civilians, promotes a positive community partnership and involvement, and provides a safe training environment on the installation.” \nFor more information about hunting on Camp Navajo, visit Camp Navajo Hunting Information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:03:16.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
