They are 6-1-0 overall. \nAntti Niemi stopped 33 shots for his third victory of the season and fourth straight against Pittsburgh. Niemi made 37 saves in a 3-0 win over the Penguins two weeks ago in Dallas. \nNick Bonino scored his first goal for Pittsburgh (3-4-0), which couldn't extend a three-game win streak. \nEvgeni Malkin's four-game points streak ended, as did his stretch of three straight games with a goal. The Penguins have scored 11 goals in their first seven games. They ended a five-game homestand, their longest this season, and will play six of their next seven on the road.
