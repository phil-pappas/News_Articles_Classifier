Sehwag’s decision comes only two days after one of his contemporaries, Zaheer Khan, decided to call time on his career. A day before his 37th birthday, Sehwag was today unveiled at the launch ceremony of the veterans’ T20 league in Dubai. When Sehwag, who was present alongside Brian Lara, Graeme Smith and Azhar Mahmood at the launch, was asked how he could play as MCL is a retired cricketers’ league, Sehwag said: “If I am not retired I will not play. I will go back to India and announce my retirement.” MCL is supposed to be played in February next year, which means that Sehwag will complete his Ranji Trophy commitments with Haryana before joining the veterans’ league. In a glorious international career spanning over 12 years, Sehwag played 104 Tests, scoring 8586 runs at an impressive average of 49.34. He has 23 centuries and 32 half-centuries to his credit. He is the only Indian to have scored a triple-century in Tests. In fact, Sehwag has scored two triple-centuries — 319 against Pakistan and 309 against South Africa. In 251 ODIs, he accumulated 8273 runs at an average of 35.05 and scored 15 hundreds apart from hitting 38 fifties. In 19 Twenty20 Internationals, he managed 394 runs with two half-centuries. He was part of the teams that won the 2007 World T20 in South Africa and the 2011 World Cup in India. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:20:25.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
