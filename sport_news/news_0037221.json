He said a spinal fluid leak was the cause of symptoms including headaches that continue to keep him from rejoining the team. \nThe Warriors are scheduled to leave town Friday to play exhibitions against the Los Angeles Lakers in San Diego and Anaheim, with a contest in between against the Los Angeles Clippers at Staples Center. The Warriors' regular-season opener will come four days after the Warriors arrive home from the trip. \n\"I don't how much he'll be involved in what we'll be doing as far as practice and games,\" Walton said of Kerr joining the preseason trip.
