(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) — Carlos Osorio \nIn many respects, the Bears’ 37-34 overtime defeat against the Detroit Lions on Sunday in Detroit was lost at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. \nIt was lost when the Bears allowed the NFL’s worst rushing team to rip off 155 yards on the ground, 4.8 yards a carry, and were only able to average 2.9 yards a carry themselves, rushing for only 91 yards. \nBears right tackle Kyle Long expressed disgust with his personal performance on Twitter after the game, mainly because of his two penalties. But although his performance was sub-par, it wasn’t awful. \nAcross the line from tackle-to-tackle, the Bears struggled to get much push on the ground, but their pass protection actually wasn’t bad. \nCutler was hit a few times and hurried several more, but only sacked once, and, for the most part, had the time he needed to find his targets. \nConsidering he was man up with “Ziggy” Ansah, the NFL’s leading sacker going into the game, Charles Leno Jr. was impressive in pass protection. But he continues to struggle to block the run. \nHroniss Grasu had a nice game, but he rarely had a player on his nose and spent most of the day helping with double-teams. \nOn the day, the offensive line was a C -; Leno perhaps a C+. \nWith Ego Ferguson out, Jeremiah Ratliff slid out to the five-technique and Eddie Goldman started on the nose with Jarvis Jenkins on the other end. \nSpelled occasionally by Will Sutton and Mitch Unrein, none of the five stood out and after getting gashed on the ground and failing to provide any consistent pressure on Matt Stafford. The group was a C-, at best. \nReceiver Alshon Jeffery played well, catching the football in his return to the lineup after a four-game absence, but did suffer two costly penalties. \nReceiver Eddie Royal also returned from injury, and along with Marquess Wilson and Cameron Meredith, they were solid but unspectacular. \nTight end Martellus Bennett continues to be an important presence, but also continues to have the drops. His 34 receptions lead the team, but his 64 percent success rate on 53 targets just isn’t good enough, and he caught only six of the 11 passes quarterback Jay Cutler tried to get to him in Detroit. \nWilson has the same problem with only 17 catches on the season on 30 targets, only a 56.6 percent conversion rate. \nThe receiver corps was a B- in Detroit; Jeffery a B+. \nRunning back Matt Forte had his least productive game of the year against the Lions, and Jeremy Langford managed only 10 yards on five carries. \nBoth were productive catching the ball and their ground problems were in large part because of their blocking, but they still didn’t earn more than a C+ for the game. \nCutler was good again this week, but not quite as accurate as he’d been the three weeks prior. He was a solid B. \nHis one interception was costly, but it wasn’t a typical Cutler mistake putting the ball somewhere he shouldn’t, it was actually a good idea that was off target. \nLinebak Sam Acho was the best Bear on the field Sunday, and Christian Jones was extremely active, but not always in the right place at the right time. \nPernell McPhee played well, and Willie Young and Lamarr Houston logged a season-high 41 and 29 snaps, respectively. \nThe linebackers were a B-; Acho a B+. \nOnly cornerback Tracy Porter was better than awful in the secondary, and he was only average, but average covering Calvin Johnson isn’t bad. \nThe Bears really need to replace Sherrick McManis at the nickel and should be awfully close to a decision to either try Kyle Fuller at safety or put him on the bench, because he had another bad game Sunday on the corner. \nThe injury to Terrance Mitchell might be handcuffing Ed Donatell and Vic Fangio a bit in the secondary. \nBut it’s puzzling that Alan Ball was healthy enough to go for seven snaps , but they’re apparently unwilling to use him at the nickel instead of McManis. \nAgainst the Lions, the secondary was a D, and that might be generous. \n• Chicago Football editor Hub Arkush can be reached at harkush@chicagofootball.com or on Twitter @Hub_Arkush.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:36:52.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
