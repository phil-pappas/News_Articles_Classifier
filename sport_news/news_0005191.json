Juniors Jared Pulsfort and Grant Murray ran for Highlands’ only touchdowns on the day. \nThe win marked Highlands’ 13th consecutive victory over CovCath, a streak that dates back to 2006 when CovCath made its last state title run. The Bluebirds now lead the all-time series 46-17. \n“We always love beating CovCath,” Murray said. “It’s always a big rivalry and a good game.” \nMurray’s 13-yard touchdown run up the middle on the opening drive of the second half with 10:02 to play in the third quarter put Highlands ahead for good. CovCath had five more possessions to answer, but was only able to muster 81 yards after halftime. \n“That was the turning point in the game,” Murray said of his touchdown. “That was our mentality the whole game – run it right at them and play smash-mouth football. That’s what we kept doing, and it worked.” \nThe Colonels’ best chance to retake the lead came in the fourth quarter when they constructed a nine-play drive that took them inside the Bluebirds’ 30 with under four minutes to play, but Highlands junior Bradley Greene picked off CovCath quarterback AJ Mayer at the 5 and returned the ball back to the 50. \nCovCath had one more shot, starting from its own 28 with 1:46 to play in the game, but junior Trey Bowden picked Mayer off again on the second play of the drive to seal the Bluebirds’ win. \nAccording to coach Brian Weinrich, both Greene and Bowden had recently been moved from the offensive side of the ball to the defensive side due to injuries. \n“(The defensive performance) was huge,” Weinrich said. “We knew if we could just keep the game in front of us and play smart (we’d be fine). The two big interceptions … those guys were offensive guys a couple of weeks ago. They’ve been getting better in practice, and they made huge plays.” \nSenior Jared Dougherty and junior Sam Taylor led Highlands’ defense, which stepped up huge in the second half. Dougherty was in on a team-high 11 tackles, and Taylor had 10, including nine solo. Senior Luke Lindeman forced the Colonels’ other turnover when he sacked Mayer on the opening drive of the game, jarring the ball loose. Senior Austin Mayhew came up with the recovery. \nHighlands quarterback Austin Hergott was sharp all game, finishing with just two incompletions. He was 9-for-11 for 93 yards. \n“This is awesome,” Hergott said. “Being here and doing this in this atmosphere is insane.” \nHighlands 0 7 7 0 - 14 \nCovCath 3 7 0 0 - 10 \nC – Kloska 21 field goal \nC – Best 4 run (Kloska kick) \nH – Pulsfort 5 run (Dougherty kick) \nH – Murray 13 run (Dougherty kick) \nRecords: H 3-5, C 2-6 31 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1LANEa9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:38:32.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
