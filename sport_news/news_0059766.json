Jerry Brown that bans the term redskins at all public schools. Assembly Bill 30, authored by Luis Alejo, D-Watsonville, passed overwhelmingly in the Assembly in May. The law goes into effect in 2017. Alejo has said the term is a racial slur that promotes discrimination against American Indians. Since May, Superintendent Mark Campbell said many in the community have opposed the ban. “Throughout the legislative process we got feedback,” said Campbell. “A lot of people are upset, but I’m sure there are people that are pleased by it. We understand both sides.” The estimated cost of the rebranding is between $60,000 to $70,000, Campbell said. There is a possibility the school will keep the logo, a portrait of an American Indian chief, and only change the name. The move would still leave a large amount of items to be replaced, like the scoreboard, team uniforms, gym mural, and various booster-club-designed clothing. But Campbell isn’t interested in holding onto the image. “My concern with keeping the indian logo is what happens when they go after chiefs or braves,” he said. “It’s only a matter of time.” Campbell said the American Indian population around San Andreas is not among those offended. The school has consulted with the Calaveras Band of Mi-Wuk Indians about the use of the term and has their approval. Agreements between the tribe and school have resulted in the elimination of any images that depict American Indians as caricatures, and caused the school to re-evaluate the use of American Indian imagery in respect to tribal beliefs. When the school planned to paint the image of an American Indian headdress on the gym floor, the tribe informed the district that not even the depiction of a headdress should be on the ground. Members of the Calaveras Band of Mi-Wuk Indians and the Tuolumne County band of Me-Wuk Indian’s could not be reached for comment Monday. Calaveras High School, now on fall break, will soon start the process of selecting a new mascot, which Campbell said will be student-driven but will include staff and community input. Though the school has until 2017 and an additional two-years to “phase-out” the old merchandise and uniforms, Campbell says the school isn’t necessarily waiting until the deadline. “If it comes earlier, it comes earlier,” he said.
