Dickey — who had allowed just five singles to that point — and called for Price to face Rangers’ left-handed hitter Shin-Soo Choo.\nGibbons said Price — who made his post-season debut as the Tampa Bay Rays’ rookie closer in 2008 — was available to pitch in relief in both Sunday’s and Monday’s do-or-die games. But the expectation was it would be in case Marco Estrada or Dickey ran into trouble early, not in low-leverage long relief. Monday’s gambit seemed an unnecessarily desperate move given the six-run lead.\nGranted, Choo and the next batter, Adrian Beltre, were responsible for four of the five hits Dickey allowed, so perhaps Gibbons was angling for a pre-emptive strike — stopping a rally before it started.\nPrice had also already briefly warmed up in the first inning after Dickey allowed back-to-back singles, so Gibbons may have also felt he had to get some outs of his big lefty, having already gotten him loose.\nThe Jays are also without their top left-handed reliever, Brett Cecil, who tore his calf muscle in Game 2, so there are myriad possible explanations. But it was still a startling decision.\nIt also shows the faith Gibbons has in Stroman, the effervescent right-hander who got off to a bumpy start in Game 2 — though he wasn’t helped any by the Jays’ sloppy defence — but settled in for a typically stellar outing.\nDickey, fulfilling the “poetic” narrative of making his first post-season start in the city where his knuckleball was born and against the team that drafted him, pitched well Monday, despite the early hook. The Rangers scored their only run against him on a wild pitch — an unwieldy knuckler that eluded catcher Russell Martin.\nPrice initially looked comfortable in the bullpen. Not only did he catch Kevin Pillar’s second-inning homer on the fly — grinning widely as the Jays went up 4-0 — but he retired his first six batters. But as his outing wore on, he ran into trouble, giving up three runs on six hits, and making Jays’ fans sweat.\nThe Price-Stroman debates will rage for sure, but the story of Monday’s game was another strong offensive showing by the Jays, whose bats came alive in Arlington.\nOn the weekend, with his team trailing two games to none, Gibbons had said his charges needed to breakout offensively if they were to have any chance at a comeback. While the Jays excelled in all facets of the game in their historic second half, their high-octane offence carried them all season and remains their greatest strength.\n“When we score, we win,” Gibbons said.\nHe’s been proven right thus far, as the Jays combineding to outscore the Rangers 13-5 over the past two games.\nHolland’s struggles Monday, in particular, provided delicious revenge for Jays’ fans, peeved at the quirky left-hander, who was caught on video mock-wiping his behind with a Rogers Centre rally towel last week in Toronto.\nOn Monday it was despondent Rangers’ fans — roasting in the 34C heat under a cloudless sky — using the rally towels to cover their heads, hoping for some meagre protection from the elements.\nSunday’s win took a load off, Gibbons said, reminding his team of what they were through most of the season. After Monday, they’re all the way back.\n“I don’t think our mood in the clubhouse ever wavered from how we normally are,” said 42-year-old reliever LaTroy Hawkins. “Was there a sense of urgency? Yes. So that win yesterday was crucial.”\nWhen Troy Tulowitzki hit his three-run homer to make it 5-0 Jays in Game 3, Hawkins said the mood turned in the Jays’ bullpen.\n“We got to saying, ‘Now we go.’ And every guy in the bullpen was saying ‘Now we go.’ That’s what we needed to get us going.”\nMore on thestar.com\nLeafs rally from three-goal deficit but lose in shootout\nCubs even playoff series with Cardinals with 6-3 victory", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:38:03.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
