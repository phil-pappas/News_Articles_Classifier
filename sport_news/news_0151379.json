Almost two years later, in June 2012, Philbrook reported that Bergin threatened her with two dozen phone calls.\nBergin eventually pleaded guilty to the assault and battery charges and was sentenced to six months in jail beginning in July 2012, plus probation until March 2014.\nIn April 2011, records show he threatened to blow up a woman’s car after she told him he had to leave her Malden apartment. In May 2012, records show he threatened another girlfriend in Boston. The woman told Boston police that he spit on her and texted her “Start praying cuz ur world is gonna feel wat I am … I promise u.”\nThe Boston Herald reported Friday morning that in 2004, Bergin received an 18-month sentence for throwing a phone at Philbrook’s 7-year-old neice.\nBergin said he’s not that person anymore. He was addicted to drugs, he said, calling himself the “poster child” for the opiate epidemic, but has been clean for almost four years.\n“I’ve been guilty of hurting nobody other than myself the whole time,” he said.\nBergin received national attention two weeks ago when he posted two videos on his Facebook page of him and friend Jason Foster encountering a “sea monstah”—a creature that turned out to be a sunfish.\nBergin has capitalized on his opportunity, the Boston Globe reported , by printing some of his memorable sayings on T-shirts and licensing the rights to the video on YouTube. His sister-turned-manager told the newspaper that producers are calling about a possible reality show.\nHer brother didn’t ask for any of this fame, Leanne Bergin said.\n“All my brother did was go fishing with his buddy and upload a video to Facebook,” she said. “To no fault of his own did he become famous overnight … Everyone deserves a second chance at life.”\n“People have heard my mouth,” Michael Bergin said. “My mouth has gotten me in trouble my whole life. If you add that mouth with the drug problem, you start scaring people.”\nPhilbrook, 42, said she dated Bergin for 15 years before the September 2010 assault. She and her now-63-year-old mother have permanent restraining orders against Bergin. She said her mother is an avid Jimmy Kimmel fan and was watching Monday night when Bergin appeared on the show via satellite.\n“My mother’s afraid of him,” Philbrook said. She “saw him on TV and was hysterical.”\nPhilbrook said when she first saw the video of Bergin and Foster, she just laughed. “I thought people are going to think they’re morons,” she said.\nBut as she’s seen his fame rise, she felt like she had to say something .\n“Everyone has skeletons in their closet,” she said. “This is more than a few skeletons.”", "external_links": ["http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/09/30/call-makers-business-opportunity-bro/1Fod7A0vaIGd9dCxqvvJfL/story.html", "https://www.facebook.com/melanie.philbrook.9/posts/10156133725105436?pnref=story", "http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/columnists/jessica_heslam/2015/10/heslam_fishing_viral_video_stars_catch_hell"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:27:36.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
