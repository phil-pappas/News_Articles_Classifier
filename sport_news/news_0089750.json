Offensive coordinator Bill Cubit was promoted to replace Beckman. \n“That’d be tough,” Stave said. “With all the changes we’ve had here, that’s not something that we’ve ever had to deal with.” \nThe only comparable situation Stave could come up with was then-UW coach Bret Bielema firing offensive line coach Mike Markuson two games into the 2012 season and replacing him with Bart Miller. \n“I know that was kind of weird for the offensive line, just switching coaches midseason like that, but with it being a head coach that’s a whole different challenge,” said Stave, who was a redshirt freshman at the time Markuson was fired. “It’s cool the way they’ve rallied around their new coach and their team.” \nThe Illini, who are coming off a bye week, are 4-2 overall and 1-1 in the Big Ten. A victory on Saturday would not only end a five-game losing streak to the Badgers, it would boost Illinois’ chances of producing a winning record in conference play for the first time since 2007, when the Illini finished in a tie for second under Ron Zook and played in the Rose Bowl. \nCubit, who led Western Michigan to three bowl games and a 55-49 record over eight seasons from 2005-12, was a natural to fill the interim role. It appears he’s been able to stabilize — at least temporarily — a program that went 12-25 overall and 4-20 in Big Ten games under Beckman. \nAfter three blowouts to start the season — the Illini routed Kent State and Western Illinois before losing 48-14 to North Carolina — Illinois won two games by a combined three points. A week after beating Middle Tennessee 27-25, Cubit’s team rallied for a 14-13 victory over Nebraska. \nJunior quarterback Wes Lunt, who began his career at Oklahoma State, helped Illinois cover 72 yards in seven plays and 41 seconds in the final minute against the Cornhuskers. Lunt’s 1-yard touchdown pass to senior Geronimo Allison with 10 seconds remaining capped off the drive. \nIn two seasons at Illinois, Lunt has thrown 24 touchdown passes and just five interceptions in 474 attempts. \nThat ratio is at 9-to-2 this season despite the absence of wideout Mike Dudek, who injured his knee in the spring after setting Illinois records for receptions (76) and receiving yards (1,038) as a true freshman in 2014. \nThe 6-foot-4 Allison, who leads the Big Ten in receptions per game and is second in receiving yards, has taken over as Lunt’s primary target. \n“He doesn’t have a whole lot of thought process going in his mind about how to throw, all the other stuff that’s going through these kids’ minds,” Cubit said of Lunt. “He’s just free and easy throwing the ball. He’s really accurate.” \nMeanwhile, Illinois has made major improvements on the other side of the ball. The Illini rank 30th nationally in total defense after finishing last season 110th in that category. \nOpponents are only converting 22.3 percent of the time on third down against the Illini, placing Illinois behind only Michigan among Big Ten teams. \nJunior Dawuane Smoot, an end/linebacker hybrid, is third in the Big Ten with 11½ tackles for loss. He’s also accounted for five of the Illini’s Big Ten-low six sacks on the season. \nCubit, 62, used the bye week following Illinois’ 29-20 loss at Iowa on Oct. 10 to do some recruiting and put the Illini through some light practices that focused mainly on fundamentals. \nWho will coach the Illini beyond this season is anyone’s guess. For now, it’s Cubit, and the only thing on his mind is trying to deliver a victory over the Badgers on Illinois’ Homecoming. \n“We’re just trying to play with a lot of emotion, a lot of passion,” he said, “and just make sure we don’t make the kind of mistakes that can kill you in this kind of game.” +1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:17:39.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
