Rich Renomeron/Flickr Despite four out of 11 Arizona congressional delegates voting to shut down the federal government over Planned Parenthood funding, citizens can take a deep breath knowing that the country narrowly averted that fate — at the very last moment, both houses of Congress passed stopgap spending bills, giving lawmakers a few more months to figure out the budget situation.\nTalk of a federal government shutdown has worried many for months, and until Speaker of the House John Boehner announced his resignation last week, it was unclear whether Republicans would once again hold the government hostage and allow it to shut down like they did for 17 days in 2013.\nMuch to the chagrin of conservatives, yesterday's bills didn't defund Planned Parenthood, and many have vowed to continue the fight against the organization. (The House of Representatives did pass another bill to cut off all federal dollars to Planned Parenthood, but the Senate is not expected to move it forward.)\nIn the weeks leading up to Wednesday's vote, our elected officials in Arizona came out on both sides of the issue, and not all ended up voting predictably.\nRelated Stories Hundreds Turn Out for Planned Parenthood Rallies Across Arizona Arizona U.S. Representatives Vote 5-4 to Defund Planned Parenthood as House Passes Two Funding-Freeze Bills McCain: Defund Planned Parenthood or Shut Down Federal Government Here's a breakdown of how our congressional delegates voted:\n**A \"nay\" vote means let the government shut down.\nSenators:\nJohn McCain: yea\nJeff Flake: yea\nRepresentatives:\nAnn Kirkpatrick (D-Flagstaff): yea\nMartha McSally (R-Tucson): yea\nRaúl Grijalva (D-Yuma): yea\nPaul Gosar (R-Prescott): nay\nMatt Salmon (R-Mesa): nay\nDavid Schweikert (R-Scottsdale): nay\nRuben Gallego (D-Phoenix): yea\nTrent Franks (R-Glendale): nay\nKyrsten Sinema (D-Tempe-Phoenix): yea\nThere were three surprising votes, the most obvious being Republican McSally's. But McCain's \"yea\" vote also was significant because, depending on whom you ask, it might represent another flip-flop.\nIn the past he's been strongly against any government shutdown, but in an interview with NPR a few weeks ago, he suggested that the controversy over Planned Parenthood might be worth it. McCain's communication director says his words were taken out of context , but the NPR transcript suggests otherwise.\nWhile many, including President Obama , are celebrating Wednesday's vote, those Republicans who voted against it are anything but thrilled.\n“Today’s vote lacks the leadership our nation is demanding. Rather than taking a principled stand against arguably illegal activities, the House today surrendered to the demands of Planned Parenthood’s management and took up a continuing resolution that aimed to continue providing funding to an organization under multiple investigations for their potentially illegal abortion practices,\" Salmon stated.\nPerhaps he summed up the situation well when he went on to explain that because the fight over Planned Parenthood funding continues, the threat of a government shutdown is not quite over: \"We will again confront this issue in December, and I am hopeful that the House’s new leadership will pay more attention to the will of the American people than their own desire to capitulate.\"\nThough unfortunately for him, every recent poll shows Americans overwhelmingly support Planned Parenthood.\nContact: Miriam Wasser Phoenix New Times Get the This Week's Top Stories Newsletter Every week we collect the latest news, music and arts stories — along with film and food reviews and the best things to do this week — so that you’ll never miss Phoenix New Times' biggest stories.", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/politics/most-americans-oppose-defunding-planned-parenthood-162813953.html", "http://www.twitter.com/phoenixnewtimes", "http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=429219665", "https://salmon.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-salmon-statement-passage-senate-agreement-funding-government", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/01/us-usa-fiscal-idUSKCN0RU1V420151001", "https://www.facebook.com/phoenixnewtimes"], "published": "2015-10-01T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:49:34.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
