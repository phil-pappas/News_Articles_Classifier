This season, both sides of Chicago had dominant offensive players.\nWhite Sox first baseman Jose Abreu has been perhaps the one offensive player who didn’t disappoint — though his numbers dipped from his rookie season. In 2015, Abreu hit 30 homers (36 in 2014), produced 100 RBIs (106, 2014) and maintained a .290 batting average (.317, 2014).\nAbreu’s counterpart on the North Side, Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo, is also a finalist for the offensive award. Rizzo has been a huge stabilizing force for a young, but talented Cubs squad. He finished the season with 31 home runs, 101 RBIs and a .278 BA.\nThese two hitters appear to be viable candidates for many Hank Aaron Awards during the course of their careers.\nView image | gettyimages.com", "external_links": ["http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/491319690", "http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/476047556"], "published": "2015-10-06T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:11:11.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
