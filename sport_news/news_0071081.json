(Photo: File photo) 14 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nKey Matchups Millville LB Clayton Scott (5-feet, 7-inches, 167 pounds) vs. Ocean City quarterback Andrew Donohue (6-2, 180). The Red Raiders run a spread offense, looking to get the ball to their playmakers in space. Donohue threw for 202 yards in a 13-7 setback to Vineland in Week 2, and has the ability to get his team down the field quickly. Scott is Millville’s top pass rusher. If he can disrupt Donohue’s rhythm, the Thunderbolts will have a good chance at pulling out the win. Millville LB Zack Douglas (6-0, 206) vs. Ocean City RB Dan Henderson (5-8, 192). If the Thunderbolts slow down Ocean City’s aerial attack, the Red Raiders will turn to Henderson to get the offense moving. Henderson rushed for 98 yards against Vineland earlier this year, and is the team’s steadiest producer on the ground. Douglas leads Millville in tackles (48) and tackles for loss (15). He’ll be keying on Henderson all game. Millville C Stephen Haynes (6-1, 286) vs. Ocean City DT Christian Baumgardner (6-5, 235). The Thunderbolts, like the Red Raiders, have excelled through the air. Quarterback Will Polhamus has completed an area-best 42 passes this season and he’ll look to continue that success against Ocean City. To do that, he’ll need to stay upright, and that means keeping Baumgardner, a University of Virginia recruit, out of the backfield. Haynes will have a key role in slowing him down. \nKeys to the Game Millville needs to start fast. Ocean City pulled out its first victory of the season last week, topping Egg Harbor Township 19-7. The Red Raiders scored the first 19 points of the game - all in the first half. The Thunderbolts have averaged fewer than 15 points per game this year (14.75). Millville has a lot of potential on offense, but is still trying to put together a complete game. If the Thunderbolts fall behind early, it’ll make earning a victory far more difficult. Millville must maintain balance on offense. The Thunderbolts finally got their ground game going in their win over Absegami last week, rushing for a season-best 180 yards. If Millville can continue that success running the ball, Polhamus will have a lot more opportunities to air it out down the field. Millville has to cut down on turnovers. The Thunderbolts scored a season-high 22 points against Absegami, but they could’ve had a lot more had they not given the ball away four times (three interceptions, lost fumble). Ocean City proved it was capable of pulling off an upset with its win over EHT. Millville can’t afford to let the Red Raiders hang around. \nPrediction \nMillville 20, Ocean City 6 \n— Josh Friedman \nMillville (2-2) at Ocean City (1-4) \nWhen: Friday, 7 p.m. \nWhere: Carey Stadium, 501 Atlantic Ave., Ocean City \nCoaches: Millville: Dennis Thomas (1st season, 2-2); Ocean City: Kevin Smith (5th season, 13-32). \nOn the air: Live on TV SNJ channel 22 or www.snjtoday.com \nAll-time series: Millville leads 27-23-2. \nLast meeting: Millville 49, Ocean City 10, 2014.
