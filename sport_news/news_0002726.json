Seventh seed Caroline Garcia of France also advanced by defeating Anastasiya Komardina of Russia 6-0, 6-2. \nIn Tianjin, world No. 6 Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland swept into the Tianjin Open quarterfinals yesterday, dismissing the host country’s Wang Qiang in straight sets. \nThe second seed prevailed 6-1, 6-1 in less than an hour. \nBut sixth seed Teliana Pereira of Brazil went out to unseeded Danka Kovinic of Montenegro, who won 6-2, 5-7, 6-1. \nUkraine’s Lyudmyla Kichenok was beaten by Tianjin native Duan Yingying 7-6 (5), 2-6, 4-6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:24:47.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
