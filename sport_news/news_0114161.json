Some others don't even have Lyles, the 12th overall pick in June's draft, on their boards.\nBut you can bet that won't stop the Jazz's veterans from giving props to the youngster's game.\n\"The type of player he is is kind of perfect for what we need,\" forward Joe Ingles said.\nThe Jazz auditioned more than 100 players last summer and on draft night zeroed in on Lyles, the 6-foot-10 forward out of Kentucky. The selection — with Lyles' Wildcat teammate, the sharpshooting Devin Booker still on the board — may not have been as flashy as others. But the Jazz believe Lyles can be a perfect complement to the young core being built in Utah.\n  \"He can score on the block. He's a great passer. Not as good as me, but he might be second on the team,\" Ingles cracked. \"He's just one of those guys who just kind of fits in. You don't even notice. He just kind of slotted in really easy.\"\nLyles was the third of four Kentucky freshmen selected in the lottery, and of the four he may have the smallest role during his rookie season. He figures to be a regular for the Jazz on the court this season, but his minutes will be limited in a crowded frontcourt rotation that already features Booker, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert.\n\"I'm just expecting to contribute to the team,\" Lyles said, \"by doing everything I'm capable of doing to help the team win.\"\nWhile that kind of role won't help his chances of winning Rookie of the Year or All-Rookie team honors, it should provide a chance to develop his game.\nAlready, he's impressed his teammates with his skillset — specifically his willingness to drive by slower defenders on the wing and ability to pull up off the dribble for a shot — as well as his understanding of the game.\n\"He's a good young player,\" Utah forward Trevor Booker said. \"He has a lot of potential. He just needs to keep working hard and stay focused and understand nothing's going to be given to him. He's going to have to earn everything. I think he understands that.\"\n\nafalk@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @tribjazz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:50:46.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
