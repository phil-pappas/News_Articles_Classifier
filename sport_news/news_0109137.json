Both are signs of youth and the kind of power associated with a man nicknamed Thor.\nAdChoices Over time, fastballs lose a couple of miles an hour and hair thins. The thing gained in exchange is life experience, and with that comes knowing how to handle pressurized, daunting, important situations. Syndergaard will have to look for something else to come with age, because he already has that.\nMORE: Keys from NLCS Game 2 | Best NLCS photos | Murphy sets Mets postseason homer record\nThe 23-year-old right-hander, who pitched valiantly but ultimately lost to Zack Greinke in Game 2 of the Division Series, then threw a dominant inning of relief to help preserve the Mets’ decisive Game 5 victory, outdueled Jake Arrieta, possibly this year’s Cy Young winner, in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series on Sunday night. Syndergaard pitched 5 2/3 innings, allowing one run on three hits with one walk while striking out nine. Staked to a 3-0 lead after one inning, Syndergaard kept Chicago off the board until the sixth, on his 101st and final pitch.\nIt was a very different outing from Syndergaard’s major league debut in May, when he gave up three runs on six hits with four walks at Wrigley Field, taking a 6-1 loss to the Cubs.\n“I wasn’t really thinking about my last start with them, making my debut, because I feel like a completely different pitcher now,” Syndergaard said. “Being able to work with Dan (Warthen, the Mets’ pitching coach) has been a true joy, and being around Jacob (deGrom) and Matt (Harvey) and (Steven) Matz, and even Bartolo (Colon), even though there’s a bit of a language barrier, he’s a lot of fun to watch, and soak in as much knowledge as possible from those guys.”\nLearning to pitch, rather than simply throw, is something that takes many pitchers a good deal more time than it has taken Syndergaard, and it is one reason that he is as good as he is right now. The other part of the equation is something that cannot be taught so much as it has to develop from within — the ability to handle the big situation. Syndergaard did that Sunday, and because he did the Mets go to Chicago with a 2-0 lead in the series rather than tied at a game apiece.\n“Composure-wise, just being able to control himself a little bit better this time, obviously,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said when asked what differences he noticed between Syndergaard five months ago and Syndergaard on Sunday night. “His stuff’s always good. I mean, that’s really kind of velocity, and the other pitches are good, too. But right now he’s just a little bit more polished than when we’d first seen him. He’s very good. He’s going to continue to get better.”\nThe idea of Syndergaard improving further is why Mets left-hander Jon Niese, who relieved Syndergaard and struck out Anthony Rizzo to end the sixth inning, had said a day earlier that he expects the young right-hander to contend for the Cy Young as soon as next year. Syndergaard showed why by not allowing a hit between Kris Bryant’s two-out single in the first inning and Dexter Fowler’s one-out single in the sixth.\nMORE: Five takeaways from NLCS Game 2\nChicago did not get a runner into scoring position against Syndergaard until Fowler advanced to second base on a wild pitch before Bryant doubled him home.\n“He’s done an amazing job of continuing to stay confident and stay under control, no matter what the situation is,” said Curtis Granderson, who went 1-for-3 with two stolen bases and two runs scored, and also robbed Chris Coghlan of a home run off Syndergaarrd with a leaping catch at the right field wall in the third inning. “He gets runners on base, he trusts his stuff. If he does feel a little out of whack, he’ll grab (catcher Travis) d’Arnaud from behind the plate and get back on rhythm, whatever it needs to be — whether it’s pitch selection or maybe doing something a little too fast or too slow. He finds a way to keep himself in the ballgame a little bit longer.”\nWhere Syndergaard still has room to improve is in being economical with his pitches, because throwing 101 without making it through six innings does tax the bullpen. Some of that comes with being a high-strikeout pitcher, of course, and as it worked out, New York’s bullpen did the job, retiring 10 of the final 12 batters of the game.\n“He was good,” said Cubs rookie slugger Kyle Schwarber, who struck out all three times he faced Syndergaard. “You tip your cap to him. He was hitting spots, being consistent with off-speed and heaters. He just did a great job today.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-18/nlcs-2015-mets-cubs-daniel-murphy-home-run-streak-jake-arrieta-carlos-beltran", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658639-nlcs-2015-mets-cubs-noah-syndergaard-strikeouts-daniel-murphy-home-run-jake-arrieta", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-19/nlcs-2015-mets-cubs-noah-syndergaard-daniel-murphy-game-2-mlb-playoffs", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658527-nlcs-2015-mets-cubs-photos-pictures-mlb-postseason-playoffs-daniel-murphy-starlin-castro"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:03:19.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
