Trump especially is on record as to what he would do as far as illegal immigrants, refuges, etc. Time for him to address this more important topic.\nAfter over 40 attempts to repeal Obamacare and about 18 months to investigate Benghazi, I am curious as to why our elected officials cannot find the time to do something about gun violence in the country.\nJohn Hartung\nMenifee\nObama exploits tragedy\nOnce again, President Obama blew it, making claims without having all of the facts. Within just hours of a mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, instead of offering condolences to those who died, he turned it into a rant against the Second Amendment.\nWe now know that the shooter shot the teacher, then turned around to the class, and asked who was Christian, at which time he started shooting them.\nWe know that the shooter may have visited radical Islamic websites. Strangely, Obama didn’t mention that fact.\nObama refused to consider any mental health issues as being a root cause of this problem. He filled his rant against the Second Amendment with phony facts to drive his claims home.\nWhat I did find strange was the fact that over the past two weekends in Chicago, Obama’s and Jesse Jackson’s home town, there were over 50 shootings each weekend. There was no moral outrage from either. All we heard was dead silence.\nDavid Baker\nRiverside\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
