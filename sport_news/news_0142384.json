We need to assess because at the end of the game against Liverpool, Harry had a small problem. He had a knock, not an injury. \n\"It is possible he will start on the bench, as normal we need to manage in a good way and assess and analyse every little detail. The player always wants to play. Afterwards I decide if the player is wrong.\" \nNjie has yet to start a game since his summer arrival from Lyon and has not scored a goal for his new club. \nWith fellow new recruit Son missing with a foot problem, Pochettino is looking light on attacking options - but insists any thoughts of further additions in the winter transfer window are far from his mind. \n\"Before January, Chadli and Son will be back,\" he added. \n\"Today is too far to January to decide - Son maybe three weeks maximum and Chadli maybe four, five or six. \n\"We have other players in the squad and we believe in all players. It is not a big problem. If we arrive in January and we believe we need to sign some players we will decide. Today I'm happy with the squad we have.\" \nVictory in Belgium would put Spurs in prime position to qualify from Group J, having taken four points from their opening two fixtures. \nThey face Anderlecht, the team they beat on penalties to win the UEFA Cup in 1984, with defender Ben Davies keen for another famous year in the club's history. \n\"Its very important for us,\" he said of the Europa League. \n\"It is a big opportunity for us to do as well as we can and hopefully pick up a trophy at the end of the season. We know that the rewards are there if we do go far in this competition.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:21:45.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
