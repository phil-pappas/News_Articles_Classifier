Klaus Stoehlker, a confidant and former advisor to Blatter, told Reuters he understood that Salman is “carefully looking at the situation of the FIFA election” but has yet to make a decision on whether or not to enter the race.\nMedia reports in Qatar have suggested Salman might run in the February vote in Zurich if Platini dropped his bid. Switzerland’s Attorney General says that Platini is somewhere “between a witness and an accused person” in the investigation of the payment.\nAsian soccer analyst Osama El-Shekh, a well-connected expert in gulf region football politics, said he has been made aware that AFC President Salman is waiting to see the outcome of the investigation into the payment.\n“In case that Platini decides not to stand, or if there is a reason, such as the Ethics Committee, that he cannot stand, then Shaikh Salman maybe will decide to stand,” the Egyptian told Reuters.\nShaikh Salman’s office was not available for comment. Shaikh Salman is closely allied with Kuwaiti Shaikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, one of the most powerful men in international sports politics.\nThe 51-year-old Shaikh Ahmad is a member of the FIFA executive committee and is also the head of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA).\nEl-Shekh said that Shaikh Ahmad would without doubt throw his weight behind any electoral move from his key ally. “They are very close friends and they support each other and will coordinate,” he said.\nAsia already has two hopeful candidates with Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein, who was defeated by Blatter in May’s vote, running again and South Korean Chung Mong-joon, the 63-year-old billionaire scion of South Korea’s Hyundai industrial conglomerate, also bidding.\nThe situation has also moved European football associations backing Platini to take a more cautious approach, awaiting the outcome of investigations.\nThe FIFA corruption scandal broke in May when 14 soccer officials and marketing executives were indicted in the United States for bribery, money laundering and wire fraud. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:30:25.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
