Manuel Pellegrini's side is level on 22 points with Arsenal but has a superior goal difference. United stays fourth on 20 points. \n\"We created more chances but didn't finish them and that's disappointing,\" United manager Louis van Gaal said. \"You need to win these games for the fans.\" \nPellegrini was happy his side avoided defeat but not a fan of his team's defensive performance. \n\"I am satisfied with a point but I don't like to play in this way,\" Pellegrini said. \"It's important to have a point here, another point in the table, but I don't think it's the way the team must play. \n\"If you can't win it, then don't lose it by not concentrating.\" \nHarry Kane scored a hat trick as Tottenham came from behind to thrash Bournemouth 5-1. \nMatt Ritchie put Bournemouth ahead after only 49 seconds before Kane leveled with a penalty. Mousa Dembele and Erik Lamela scored to put Tottenham comfortably ahead at halftime, before Kane completed his treble. \nSunderland got its first win of the season with a 3-0 victory against northeastern England rival Newcastle at the Stadium of Light. \nNewcastle was the strongest team in the opening stages but its performance was derailed when captain Fabricio Coloccini conceded a penalty on the stroke of halftime and was shown a red card after blocking a run in the penalty area from Steven Fletcher. \nAdam Johnson converted the spot kick, before Billy Jones and Fletcher also found the back of the net. \nThe win moved Sunderland off the bottom of the table and into 18th in the league on six points, above Newcastle. \nAston Villa drops to last on the day it fired manager Tim Sherwood. Villa has lost its last six league games and has not won since the first day of the season at Bournemouth. \nIn Sunday's late match, Liverpool plays Southampton in Juergen Klopp's first Premier League fixture at Anfield. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:59:18.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
