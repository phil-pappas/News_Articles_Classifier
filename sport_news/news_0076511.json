United in the Eastern Conference. \nThe Revolution is winless in four games and squandered an opportunity to clinch a playoff place in front of an expectant record f a regular-season crowd of 42,947 at Gillette Stadium. \nHowever, New England still seems certain to make the playoffs. With one regular-season game left, the Revolution leads its only challenger for the final playoff position, Orlando City, by three points and has an eight-goal advantage in goal difference. \nColumbus' Ethan Finlay and Federico Higuain scored to help the Crew win 2-0 at Columbus. \nFinlay opened the scoring in the 40th minute and Higuain connected in second-half stoppage time. \nToronto, which had won its previous four games, had already sealed a playoff berth.
