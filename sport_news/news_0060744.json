October 18, 2015 Last updated: Sunday, October 18, 2015, 1:21 AM By STEVE POPPER Print \nThe numbers have been hard to ignore. The highlights have been plentiful, shots smoothly swishing from behind the three-point arc and dunks being thrown down powerfully around the rim. But the nagging question remains: Can you believe what you’re seeing in preseason from Derrick Williams? \nThere is an old saying among baseball scouts, cautioning not to believe anything you see in spring training or with September call-ups. And it’s no different in the NBA; a meaningless game is a meaningless game with teams employing players and strategies unlike what you will see in the regular season. \nSo do you believe in a three-game, 63-point stretch? Or do you stick with a show-me-when-it-counts attitude for the player who has confounded the experts for years? \n\"I think the things he’s doing out there are what he’s capable of doing,\" his coach, the Knicks’ Derek Fisher, said. \"That’s taking good shots, good open shots when they’re presented. We don’t want him to pass those up. He’s using his athleticism on both ends of the floor and he’s being aggressive. \n\"Whether he scores 14, 16 or 18 points every night, I don’t think that’s really what the focus is. I think the idea is that he continue to just be confident in who he is, and trust that he can go make plays, and that the way we play will allow for that.\" \nThe expectations have been high for Williams since he was a freshman at the University of Arizona. He was the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year in 2010, and a year later was the No. 2 player taken in the NBA Draft. \nBut struggles in Minnesota and Sacramento dimmed the expectations for Williams, who signed on with the Knicks with a two-year contract worth just under $10 million. \nIn New York he’s not the star, and he likely won’t even be a starter. The lowered expectations are just fine with him. \n\"That’s what I did when I went to Arizona,\" Williams said. \"I just let my game do the talking. When you do have crazy expectations — not to say you don’t live up to them, but you don’t perform to that level — that’s when people start bashing you. I think that’s not fair because some people develop a lot faster than others. Other people’s opinions don’t matter to me, honestly. I come to practice every day. I work hard every day. Whether people say things about me or not, I’m just going to keep hooping.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:14:48.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
