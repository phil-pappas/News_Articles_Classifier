If I can't I can't and if I can, I can, but it will be a good challenge. \n\"If I get any sledging (verbal abuse), it's a bit of respect because they're treating me like one of the other players.\" \nECB's Director of England Women's Cricket, Clare Connor, added: \"It's great news that Sarah will get the chance to play at this level. Much has been spoken and written about Sarah's wicket-keeping prowess and I'm sure that this standard of cricket will enhance her skills and reputation further. \n\"We are always looking for new avenues to challenge the England women's players, and playing top level Australian men's club cricket will certainly be a brilliant test of Sarah's abilities. \n\"For England women to be successful on the international stage we need to make sure that they are being exposed to high pressure and high quality cricket environments. \n\"I am sure that Sarah will learn a great deal playing first grade cricket this winter, alongside featuring in the Women's Big Bash League for Adelaide Strikers.\" \nTaylor has signed to play for Adelaide Strikers in the inaugural edition of the Women's Big Bash League this winter, and is also currently playing 50-over state cricket for the Breezair SA Scorpions in the Women's National Cricket League. \nEarlier this year England women's fast bowler Kate Cross became the first woman to play in the 123-year-old Central Lancashire League.
