What happened in Turkey ... certainly is an impudent terrorist attack, a terrorist crime with scores of victims,\" Putin said in an interview with TV channel Rossiya One.\nHe stressed that the attack was an attempt to destabilise the situation in Turkey, an \"obvious\" provocation during the election campaign.\nEarlier on Saturday, twin explosions targeted a peace rally at the central railway station in the Turkish capital of Ankara, leaving at least 95 people killed and up to 186 wounded.\nWhile expressing sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims of the bomb attacks, Putin said Russia is ready to cooperate with Turkey to fight with terrorist threats.\nOn September 30, Russia started to carry out the airstrikes against positions of the extremist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria, a move that had been criticized by the US to be mainly aiming at striking Syria's anti-government rebels.\nWhile claiming the airstrikes have significantly diminished the military capacity of the IS, Russian Defence Ministry confirmed that \"constructive\" discussions were conducted Saturday during the second video conference with the US on implementation of specific procedures to ensure safe air operations over Syria.\nThe Russian Defence Ministry said in an online statement that \"progress was made during the talks, and the US agreed to another discussion with Russia in the near future.\" In the past 24 hours, 55 IS targets in Syria were destroyed during 64 sorties carried out by Russian aircraft, said the ministry. â€”IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:40:26.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
