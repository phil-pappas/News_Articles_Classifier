(AP Photo/Gary Landers, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press CINCINNATI — \nThe Cincinnati Bengals reached tentative settlement of a federal lawsuit over pay for their cheerleaders, one of several cases in which NFL cheerleaders claimed they received substandard compensation. \nDocuments filed recently in U.S. District Court show the Bengals agreed to pay Ben-Gal cheerleaders a total of $255,000 to settle the 2014 lawsuit alleging that their time commitments for games, practices and promotional events netted them payment that was below minimum wage. \nThose covered cheered in the 2011-13 seasons and could receive at least $2,500 each per season. Court documents state that the Bengals started paying more in 2014 and that the team denies any wrongdoing but decided to settle the lawsuit to avoid lengthy, expensive litigation. \nThe settlement is subject to a Dec. 3 fairness hearing, and the Bengals can cancel the deal if cheerleaders with a combination of six years or more opt out. For example, if two cheerleaders who each worked three seasons refuse it — or six who each cheered one year — the Bengals have the right to withdraw. \nFormer cheerleader Alexa Brenneman would receive an extra $5,000 from the Bengals as the lead plaintiff in the legal action. An attorney for her declined comment Wednesday, and a Bengals spokesman said the team had no comment on the case. \nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown this year signed legislation recognizing professional cheerleaders in the state as employees who are entitled to minimum wage, overtime and other labor protections. Dozens of Oakland Raiders cheerleaders had settled a lawsuit with that NFL team after claiming they were paid less than $5 an hour when rehearsal time and public appearances were included. \nA former Milwaukee Bucks cheerleader recently sued the NBA team, saying she received far less than minimum wage of $7.25 an hour for games, practices, team functions and photo shoots. The team said it believed the lawsuit was without merit and will contest it. \n___ \nContact the reporter at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:25:40.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
