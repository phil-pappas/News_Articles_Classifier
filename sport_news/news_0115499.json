with a fourth-minute opener as he found himself in space after a failed clearance by the Belgian club. \nBut Anderlecht struck back nine minutes later when a corner bounced all the way through to Guillaume Gillet, who had time to take a touch before lashing home the equaliser. \nSpurs were lucky not to fall behind as Okaka threatened twice in the first half, but the Italian striker earned his reward in the 75th minute by getting on the end of a Frank Acheampong cross. \nMonaco jumped Tottenham to the top of Group G after a 1-0 win at home over Qarabag. \nLacina Traore scored in the 70th minute to give the principality club their first win of the campaign and a one-point advantage over Spurs and Anderlecht in the tight group. \nLiverpool failed to break down 10-man Rubin Kazan and settled for a 1-1 draw in Jurgen Klopp's Anfield debut. \nThe Russian side took a lead on 15 minutes when Marko Devic did well to control a long pass and put a shot past Simon Mignolet. \nBut Oleg Kuzmin soon picked his second yellow card, and Liverpool capitalised immiediately on the ensuing free kick as the ball fell in the box for Emre Can to slam home. \nBut the Reds could not find a winner despite substitute Christian Benteke hitting the post late on. \nFollowing up their draw at Anfield, Sion opened a four-point lead in Group B after winning 1-0 at Bordeaux. \nLeo Lacroix headed home Carlitos' cross in the 21st minute to put the Swiss side in a lofty position after three unbeaten matches. \nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang recorded a hat trick as Borussia Dortmund won 3-1 at Qabala in Group C. \nThe hosts had some early opportunities to take the lead as Dodo saw an attempt cleared off the line, but Aubameyang opened the scoring in the 31st minute with a curling strike from 20 yards out. \nThe 26-year-old doubled his tally seven minutes later when he was played through on goal and chipped keeper Dmitry Bezotosnyi. \nHe completed his hat trick in the second half when Bezotosnyi could only parry Sven Bender's shot following a corner, and Aubameyang tapped home from close range. \nIn the other game in Group C, PAOK managed a goalless draw at home against Krasnodar, who trail leaders Dortmund by three points. \nDespite an early red card to Mauricio, Lazio maintained their lead in Group G after a 3-1 win at Rosenborg. \nMauricio was sent off for the third time this season in the sixth minute on a desparate sliding tackle when he was the last man back. \nBut Alessandro Matri and Felipe Anderson scored either side of half-time to put the Italian side ahead, and the 10 men hung on after Alexander Soederlund got a goal back for the visitors in the 69th minute, with Antonio Candreva following up on a penalty miss to cap the scoring. \nSaint-Etienne kept pace in Group G with a 1-0 win away to Dnipro, Romain Hamouma scoring just before half-time for the French club. \nFiorentina fell to a 2-1 defeat at home against Lech Poznan and now sit bottom of Group I. \nDawid Kownacki and Maciej Gajos both scored in the second half for the Polish club, while Viola could not hit back until stoppage time, when Giuseppe Rossi scored but Ante Rebic received a red card. \nBasel remain top of the group despite a 2-1 setback at home against Belenenses. \nMichael Lang opened the scoring after a quarter-hour for Basel, but Luis Leal answered soon afterward and Kuca provided Belenenses a lead on the stroke of half-time that they would not relinquish. \nAthletic Bilbao took the lead in Group L after winning 2-0 away to Partizan Belgrade. \nRaul Garcia scored in the 32nd minute for the visitors before Benat Etxebarria scored a second five minutes from time. \nAthletic lead Partizan on goal difference, while Augsburg earned their first points with a 1-0 win at AZ Alkmaar. \nPiotr Trochowski's goal two minutes before half-time was enough for the German club to claim victory. \nNorwegian side Molde are the shock leaders in Group A after cruising past Celtic 3-1. \nOla Kamara and Vegard Forren had put Molde 2-0 up inside 18 minutes, and when Kris Commons tried to spark a Celtic comeback with a goal after the break, Mohamed Elyounoussi answered within a minute. \nAlso in Group A, Fernandao scored in the 89th minute to lift Fenerbahce to a 1-0 win over Ajax. \nThe Brazilian headed home following a corner to give the Turkish side their first win in the group stage. \nSchalke were forced to fight for a point at home against Sparta Prague in a 2-2 draw. \nFranco Di Santo gave Schalke an early lead, but Sparta took control after half-time to take the lead through Kehinde Fatai and David Lafata. \nBut in the 73rd minute, Leroy Sane equalised for Schalke, who maintained their lead atop Group K. \nAPOEL fought back to earn their first win with a 2-1 win over Asteras Tripoli, a Fernando Cavenaghi penalty at the end of the first half drawing them level before Carlao found the winner on the hour mark. \nManolo Gabbiadini scored twice as Napoli took control of Group D with a 4-1 win at Midtjylland. \nJose Maria Callejon provided the opener on 19 minutes after being played through by Kalidou Koulibaly. \nGabbiadini then scored twice in a 10-minute span, first getting on the end of a cross in the 31st minute before later blasting a left-footed shot from outside the box. \nMartin Pusic got one back for the hosts before the break, but Gonzalo Higuain added a fourth goal for Napoli late on. \nLegia Warsaw and Club Brugge played to a 1-1 draw in the other game in Group D as each team earned their first point of the group stage. \nVillarreal cruised to a 4-0 win over Dinamo Minsk as Cedric Bakambu scored twice in the first half. \nRoberto Soldado and Eric Bertrand Bailly added goals after the break as the Spanish club won the second straight home game in the group after an opening defeat. \nRapid Vienna stayed perfect in Group E after managing a 3-2 win at home over Viktoria Plzen. \nDespite falling behind in the 12th minute, Rapid hit back through Steffen Hofmann, Louis Schaub and Athanasios Petsos before hanging on for all three points after Patrik Hrosovsky got one goal back for Plzen. \nAlan scored in the closing stages as Braga won their third straight game in Group F, 3-2 over Maseille. \nNeither club could break through until the 61st minute, when Ahmed Hassan Koka scored for Braga, and Wilson Eduardo added a second in the 77th minute. \nBut the final 10 minutes saw a flurry of goals as Maseille equalised with two goals in a four-minute span from Romain Alessandrini and Michy Batshuayi, only for Alan to score for Braga from a set piece in the 89th minute. \nIn the other game in Group F, Groningen salvaged a 1-1 draw at Liberec, when Danny Hoesen followed up his stoppage-time penalty chance to equalise. \nSporting Lisbon earned their first win of the campaign in a 5-1 rout of 10-man Skenderbeu. \nHamdi Salihi was sent off for a second yellow card in the 24th minute, allowing Sporting the freedom to run away with the match. \nAlberto Aquilani and Fredy Montero scored first-half penalties, before Matheus Pereira (twice) and Tobias Figueiredo provided goals after the break. \nThe win kept Sporting in third place in Group H behind Lokomotiv Moscow and Besiktas, who drew 1-1. \nMaicon scored the opener for Lokomotiv nine minutes after half-time, only for Mario Gomez to level 10 minutes later. \nVedran Corluka was sent off with a straight red card on 69 minutes, but the Russian club were able to see out the draw. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
