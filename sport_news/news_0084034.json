We look at the potential performance on the day, that is what we try to do. After that the history doesn't play the game,\" said Wenger, whose side were knocked out by Bayern in the last 16 stage for each of the past two seasons. \n\"What will decide the game is the performance we produce, and that comes from if we believe that we can do it.\" \nWenger added: \"In Europe it is true we have been poor in our first two games, so that is what we want to correct. \n\"I must say we have our backs to the wall and we play against a top, team team, so I can understand the scepticism of people, but we have to prove them wrong.\" \nWenger knows Arsenal must shackle in-form Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who has plundered 15 goals in his last seven appearances for club and country. \n\"First the best to combat him is for us to have the ball, and after that you have to be shrewd with him,\" said Wenger, who has defender Gabriel available again following illness. \n\"Inside the box he is outstanding, because his technique, his finishing, his movement inside the box, that is where we need the experience of (Per) Mertesacker and (Laurent) Koscielny to deal with that because that will be one of the important things on the night.\" \nBayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola warned his side to expect to face an Arsenal 'animal' fighting for Champions League survival. \n\"For them, they have an advantage because they have to win, when that happens with these kind of players, and the history of this club, they are going to make the best performance possible,\" said the Spanish former Barcelona manager. \n\"Of course I prefer to come here with six points, but I can imagine my team with zero points and playing in Germany against Arsenal. \n\"I can imagine the mentality of my team - we would be an animal, because it is our last chance, you give everything and that will happen with Arsenal so you have to be prepared.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:15.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
