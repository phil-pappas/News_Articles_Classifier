The Cyclones defeated the Jayhawks 38-13. By Jesse Newell jesse.newell@cjonline.com \nAMES, Iowa — Kansas coach David Beaty continued a string of conservative decision-making in KU’s 38-13 loss to Iowa State on Saturday. \nThe most glaring example came in the second quarter with KU trailing by three and facing a fourth-and-3 from the ISU 35. Beaty at first sent out his kicker, Matthew Wyman, to attempt a 52-yard field goal with the wind at his back. Then, the coach called timeout. \nAfter thinking about it, the coach of a 20-point underdog elected to send out his punt team. The kick bounced into the end zone, netting 15 yards and killing one of KU’s best chances at scoring. \n“At that point, I felt like the best thing was to try to give our defense some better field position,” Beaty said, “than having them that close to the 50-yard line.” \nThe numbers would seem to indicate Beaty chose the worst of the three options. \nAccording to the fourth-down calculator at the website Advanced Football Analytics — built with years of NFL data, so it’s a rough estimate — going for it was the best option. Assuming two equal teams (though KU and ISU were not), the calculator says a team’s win probability is 44 percent if it goes for it on fourth-and-3, 42 percent if it attempts the field goal and 40 percent if it punts. \nBeaty said afterward he never seriously contemplated a 52-yard field goal try. When KU originally lined up for the kick, Beaty hinted the Jayhawks were going to attempt a fake. \n“There were some ideas on some things we might be doing with that,” Beaty said. “We deferred back to just the scout punt at that point and tried to see if we could pin them back down in there. It was a little ways away.” \nThe lack of faith in Wyman is also interesting, as Beaty has gone out his way in previous weeks to talk about the 65-plus-yard field goals the junior has made in practice. \nBeaty also seemed to get a couple of key details wrong in the postgame. The coach cited the weather conditions as a reason for not attempting a kick. \n“There was a little bit of wind coming into his face on that end,” Beaty said, “so that was the only thing that really held me from letting him try that.” \nKU was heading toward the south end zone, and winds all day were from the east-northeast. That meant Wyman actually was facing a crosswind with a bit of a gust at his back. Video replays showed the flags above the goalposts moving behind the end zone while Wyman was lining up on the field. \nBeaty also was hesitant to go for it because of the distance needed. \n“It was a little bit further than 3. I think it was about 4 or 5,” Beaty said. “It was a little bit too far for us in that fourth-down situation to think about staying and going for it.” \nVideo replays showed this to be inaccurate as well. When KU lined up for its punt, the ball was inches from touching the 35, with the first-down chain directly on the 32. \nSoon enough, Beaty wouldn’t have the opportunity to make a game-changing decision. ISU scored touchdowns on four of its next seven possessions to take control, with all four drives extending 62 yards or longer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:53:53.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
