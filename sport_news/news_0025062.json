In 11 starts for the Jays, Price has been the ‘ace’ the team has desperately missed and he has responded by going 9-1 with a 1.94 ERA. \nIn facing Texas he’s facing a difficult foe as he has run up against the Rangers in three playoff games and lost them all. On the flip side, Price has beaten the Rangers in his last three regular-season starts, so pick your poison. \nPrice enters the game confident enough. \n“Texas for me has always been a tough team to pitch against, especially back in the day,” he said. “Now they have (Mike) Napoli back, I think he was in the seven hole for about two or three years hitting 25, 30 home runs. So it was always a tough lineup for a left-handed pitcher to face, but I’ve thrown the ball well against them my past three times I faced those guys.” \nLater he would add: “In my last three times, I’ve thrown the ball extremely well against Texas, and all three times have been in Texas. I feel like I’ve pitched better in Texas. They’re always a tough team to pitch against. I’m going to carry the confidence over my last three starts against these guys and just go out there and make pitches.” \nAs for the rest of the Jays, manager John Gibbons said they’re ready to roll. \n“They’re all excited but they’re pretty relaxed, too,” he said. “Naturally start of the playoffs, there will be some anxieties, they’re human beings. I’ve been seeing all year there’s something different about this group, they’re very confident. We’ve added some key veterans to this team we feel has definitely helped and should help from here on out. They’re confident.” \nOne player you likely will see in almost every game — every close game that is — will be Brett Cecil. \nThe veteran left-hander got off to a rocky start this season but the last three months he has been lights out and has consistently slammed the door shut in big inning after big inning. Since June 24, Cecil has made 37 appearances without allowing an earned run. Over that time he has struck out 44 batters and walked four. \n“It was huge,” Gibbons said of Cecil’s contribution. “Coming into the season he was going to be a big guy in our bullpen, we needed him to be good like the previous two years. But he had a slow start then obviously it just clicked in for him. He was solid but then he went to that next level like he did his all-star year (2013). I can’t believe there was a better reliever out there for that stretch. \n“The big thing was that early on lefties were giving him a little bit of trouble and then he got to where he was dominating those guys too. His stuff just got better, his breaking ball was sharper. It all came together for him. It’s incredible the run he’s been on that’s for sure.” \nThis season, Cecil has been at his best when it counted most and for any player that is about as gratifying as it gets. \n“Given the start of my season, it’s very gratifying,” Cecil said. “I know it probably didn’t seem like it at the start of the season but I knew it was just a matter of time before I got back in a groove. I didn’t know how long it was going to take or how long it was going to last once I got into it but I knew it was going to be there at some point during the season and thankfully it’s been there a little more than half a season. It’s surprising, I know, but I know it was in there. I didn’t think it was going to last as long as it did but I’m very happy it did and hopefully I can continue on to the post-season.” \nThere’s no reason to think he can’t.
