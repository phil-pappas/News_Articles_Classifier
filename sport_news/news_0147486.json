Boyd went on Twitter during halftime of Saturday's game to retweet a Texas A&M fan suggesting he transfer to the Aggies.\nUSA TODAY\nTexas staggering after troubling 50-7 loss to No. 4 TCU\nThen, in the waning minutes of the loss to TCU, a social media staffer for the Texas Rangers tweeted this from the team's main account: \"Fire Charlie. #bye\"\nThe Rangers eventually apologized to Strong and announced they'd fired the tweeter ... but it wasn't quick enough to avoid the unflattering screenshots.\nStrong deserves whatever criticism he's getting for the product he's putting on the field (particularly regarding offensive consistency and his defense, as a whole) but not these social media snafus.\nWhenever ya'll are ready to transfer... We're ready. #Gig 'em @Official_MalikJ @kris23db\n— Danny Duron (@dannyboy_9161) October 3, 2015 Obviously, a player shouldn't retweet something like that, and never in the middle of a game. Obviously, a social media staffer made a mistake and posted a heated tweet from a professional sports organization's account instead of his own.\nBut these two mistakes only end up drawing more attention to Strong and Texas' 1-4 start in his second year. And they ultimately only result in two more — unearned — headaches.\nA tweet calling for Charlie Strong to be fired from the Texas Rangers account.
