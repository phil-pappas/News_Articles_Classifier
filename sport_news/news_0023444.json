Jefferson had a big rebound game Saturday against the Sooners as he recorded two key sacks on Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield in the Longhorns' 24-17 win. Jefferson recorded his first sack in the first quarter for a four-yard loss. He struck again in the fourth quarter with an eight-yard sack. The freshman linebacker from Mesquite finished with six total tackles and two tackles for loss. Jefferson's performance helped him earn the Walter Camp National FBS Defensive Player of the Week award.\nHonorable mentions: S Derrick Kindred , TCU (seven total tackles, one interception and one touchdown); DE Emmanuel Ogbah , Oklahoma State (eight total tackles, one sack, one fumble recovery and one touchdown); LB Grant Campbell , Baylor (seven total sacks, 0.5 sacks and 0.5 tackles for loss)\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-10-12T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:04:38.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
