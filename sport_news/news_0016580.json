Expansive windows must frame a pleasurable view, otherwise, what's the point of inviting nature inside?\nWright believed the right structures could enhance natural features: \"Landscape seen through the openings of the building thus placed and proportioned, has greater charm than when seen independent of the architecture.\"\nGarden clubs at Frank Lloyd Wright's Gordon House On Monday, Oct. 19, the Oregon State Federation of Garden Clubs will hold its annual gathering at Frank Lloyd Wright's Gordon House , 869 W. Main St. in Silverton. There will be a presentation at 10 a.m. by Jenny Meisel, a native and invasive plant specialist with the Marion County Soil and Water Conservation District. A native plant sale will benefit the nonprofit Gordon House and there will be displays of floral arrangements. There is no charge for the garden clubs' program from 10 a.m. to noon. Guided tours starting that day at noon, 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. are discounted to $10 ($15 other days). For information contact the Gordon House at 503-874-6006 or gordonhouse1957 @frontier.com . Learn more about the late architect's view of the outdoor environment on Monday, Oct. 19 by joining the Oregon State Federation of Garden Clubs for its annual free event at the Gordon House, which now sits among an old oak savanna in Silverton.\nThe Gordon House is the only one of Wright's residences open to the public in the Pacific Northwest and his only building in Oregon.\nHe designed the concrete-and-wood house in 1957 for Evelyn and Conrad Gordon, who requested it be surrounded by plants, wildflowers and natural grass on their Wilsonville farmland along the Willamette River, according to Molly Murphy , the director of the Gordon House.\nConstruction of the 2,133-square-foot dwelling was completed in 1964 and is celebrated as one of Wright's Usonian projects for affordable suburban housing.\nThe modern house, which also has classic examples of Wright's geometric wood fretwork, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nWhen the Wilsonville property was sold, volunteers who formed the Gordon House Conservancy and others had the home dismantled and moved next to the Oregon Garden in 2002 to save it from being demolished.\nIt was reassembled in a grove of Oregon white oaks (quercus garryana). Murphy says the placement would have pleased the demanding Wright.\n\"The deciduous trees supported Wright's passive energy and organic design for Oregon,\" says Murphy, who adds that most of the oaks have disappeared in the area because of development, agriculture and invasive plants.\nThe oaks around the Gordon House are threatened by Scot's Broom and Himalayan blackberries.\n\"Dedicated conservation and care is the only way to stop further loss and encourage future safety to maintain the important setting for the house and Frank Lloyd Wright's organic design,\" she says.\nThe nonprofit Gordon House Conservancy has received gardening help and plant donations over the years.\nIn 2007, the Oregon State Federation of Garden Clubs donated money for shrubs and large trees, including more Oregon white oaks, says Murphy.\nOver time, greenery was added to the approaches to the entryway including vine maples, flowering currant bushes and Western Redbud trees.\nMurphy says plantings around the house include compact Oregon grapes, sword ferns, yellow twig and dwarf red twig dogwoods, snowberries, Nootka roses, kinnikinnick and azaleas.\nOther native annual and perennial flowers and forbs include western columbine, goatsbeard, trout lily, great camas, common camas, harvest brodiae, Henderson's shooting star, Oregon geranium, Oregon iris, common yarrow, river lupine, Idaho blue-eyed grass, inside-out flower and California poppy.\nIn addition to the Oregon State Federation of Garden Clubs, the Gordon House Conservancy relies on volunteer gardeners, local native-plant nurseries, the Roadside Council and visitors buying $15 tour tickets, with proceeds helping to improve the landscape.\nPlants were purchased or donated by Bosky Dell Natives , Leach Botanical Garden , Oak Point Nursery , Oregon Native Plant Nursery, Wallace W. Hansen Northwest Native Plants and Monrovia .\nMurphy says there still is work to be done, including reinstalling the Wright-designed lawn terrace off the living room, which served as a transition from the terrace stairs to the land.\n\"Transition from the man-made to the natural world was a real design interest for Wright,\" says Murphy.\n-- Janet Eastman\njeastman@oregonian.com\n503-799-8739\n@janeteastman\nRead 10 of Frank Lloyd Wright's landscape tips from \"The Gardens of Frank Lloyd Wright\" by Derek Fell including :\n\"Allow trees and shrubs to grow naturally. Learn the art of pruning. Trees and shrubs that outgrow their boundaries can be carefully sized back and still look natural. Do not trim shrubs into topiary shapes so severely that they look like meatballs.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.monrovia.com/", "http://www.thegordonhouse.org/natureofwright.html", "http://www.boskydellnatives.com/", "https://twitter.com/janeteastman", "http://www.thegordonhouse.org/", "http://www.leachgarden.org/", "http://www.nwplants.com/", "http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/04001066.pdf", "http://oregongardenclubs.org/", "http://www.oakpointnursery.com/", "http://www.thegordonhouse.org/tours.html", "http://www.oregongarden.org/", "http://www.marionswcd.net/", "http://www.thegordonhouse.org/events.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:19:12.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
