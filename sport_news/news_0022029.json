As such, daily fantasy sports operated by those two companies and many of similar companies are currently illegal in the Silver State, according to the ruling.\"All unlicensed activities must cease and desist from the date of this Notice until such time as either the Nevada Revised Statutes are changed or until such entities file for and obtain the requisite licenses to engage in said activity,\" the ruling added. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
