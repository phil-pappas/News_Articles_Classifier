Ten players are currently injured. \n\"We've been in a depressed mood,\" said Dominick Hampton, a senior who is the team's star player and being considered by Washington State University. \"It's heartbreaking. It's my last year and I don't get to play half my season because of injuries.\" \nHampton is one of the injured players. He broke his hand during a game against Bellevue earlier this season. \n\"We know we're going to get injured,\" said Tao McClinton, a sophomore who is not hurt. \"We don't have enough players to play.\" \nMcClinton says Sammamish has half the number of players as most high schools they face. \nThe small number of players and high number of injuries forced the school and the district to cancel the past four games, according to a district spokeswoman.
