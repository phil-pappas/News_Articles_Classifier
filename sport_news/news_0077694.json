And, for the second consecutive season, Marcus Whitman came out on top. \nThe Wildcats pulled away late with three straight victories to post a 99-86 win and clinch at least a share of the Finger Lakes crown. \nMarcus Whitman (7-1, 5-0) has won five league championships since 2009. \n“Our girls swam great tonight,” Marcus Whitman coach Marcy Adams said. “They came into the season with big goals, and one was achieved tonight. With one more dual meet to go, the girls are really hoping for a 6-0 record in the league. \n“We had a lot of depth tonight, which helped us clinch the win. We had a lot of close races and best times. I really couldn’t be prouder to coach such a motivated team.” \nLeading by three with four events left, Marcus Whitman’s 200-yard freestyle relay team of Morgan Smithling, Aislinn Coleman, Charlotte Mineo and Courtney Copper inflated the lead to nine points with a victory. \nCopper followed with a 100 backstroke win; she took the 200 individual medley earlier in the meet. Hailey Rossi completed the run with a triumph in the 100 breaststroke. \nRossi also topped the field in the 50 freestyle. \nRachael Mayou secured wins in the 200 freestyle and 500 freestyle for the Red Raiders (4-2, 3-1), who won back-to-back league titles in 2012-13. \nNR-W/Red Creek 98, Geneva 78 \nGENEVA — Brooke Morrisseau took first in the IM and 500 freestyle for North Rose-Wolcott/Red Creek (3-3, 1-3). \nLaura Vrabel captured the butterfly and breaststroke for Geneva (0-6, 0-4). \nGananda 91 1⁄2, Midlakes 82 1⁄2 \nWALWORTH — Darby McNamara posted a personal-best time of 5:46.84 to win the 500 freestyle for Gananda (3-5, 2-3). McNamara also topped the 100 backstroke. \nLauren Johnson (200 freestyle, butterfly), Grace Cunningham (IM, breaststroke) and Krista Willard (50 and 100 free) picked up a pair of wins, also. \nThe foursome of Hazel Kettlecamp, Georgia White, Riley Backus and Bailey Mahoney touched first in the 400 freestyle relay for Midlakes (2-3). \nMONROE COUNTY EAST \nVictor 113, Canandaigua 73 \nVICTOR — Kaitlyn Ringhoff (50 free) and Sabrina Turek (500 free) collected victories to lead the Braves (3-2, 0-2).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:22:00.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
