It was a one-possession game midway through the fourth quarter. Friday night’s game was won by PV’s quarterback and receiving combination. Seven different players caught passes – Danny Hunter led the way with three catches for 68 yards and a pair of touchdowns. But the move of the night came by the Bears coaching staff when it decided to insert Brandon Keyes into the game at quarterback. The sophomore has switched at quarterback often this year with Michael Brown, but Brown – much like a pitcher having an off day – wasn’t on target for his first six passes, completing just two for -11 yards. Coach Dave Pacchioni made the move to Keyes on the last drive of the first quarter, and the offense came to life. On Keyes’ second pass – a second and 1 from their own 39 – he hit a streaking Hunter for a 61-yard touchdown. “He did a great job commanding the game,” Pacchioni said. “I think he has to clean some things up, but I can’t ask much more from a sophomore to do what he did.” Pacchioni had a quarterback battle in summer camp and the job was won by Brown. Now the coach’s stance has shifted to a new philosophy, weighing the week’s practice to determine who his starter will be at quarterback. “It’s going to come down to reps and we'll give equal reps and we’ll see who’s the best player,” Pacchioni said. “The best player will play.” - Mike Kuhns PM West vs. ES South SWIFTWATER- On a wet Friday night, the Pocono Mountain West Panthers dominated the East Stroudsburg South Cavaliers. The Panthers used a rushing attack of six runners to accumulate 425 yards and five touchdowns on the ground. Chris Monaco highlighted the night with 335 total yards. He rushed for 306 yards and three touchdowns on only 13 carries. In the fourth quarter, Cavalier quarterback and punter Jake Cirillo pinned the Panthers back on their own 4-yard line. Monaco ran 96 yards for a touchdown the very next play on his last carry of the night. While Monaco shined, the first half was all Greg Bensley, as he had over 100 yards and a touchdown at halftime. The Cavaliers obviously were determined to stop Bensley in the second half, and he was held to just seven yards and a touchdown after halftime. This opened up holes for Monaco who took advantage, running for 252 yards in the secondnd half alone. “This week we put it all together,” PM West head coach Jim McCarroll said. “We wanted them both to get touches and you saw what happened tonight. They did a great job and it's hard for people to match up sometimes.” The weather did not help the Cavaliers passing game as Cirillo completed only 10 of 27 attempts, but he still accumulated 188 yards on the night. The conditions made the ball wet, causing Cirillo to overthrow targets and receivers to drop balls that should have been caught. The Panther defense also did a great job covering Changa Hodge all night holding him to just 2 receptions. West has now won 2 straight and improves to a 2-4 record while South falls to a 1-5 record on the year. The Panthers travel to Dieruff next week looking to continue their win streak, while the Cavaliers look to bounce back at home against William Allen. - Jake Higgins ES North NAZARETH - The Timberwolves suffered an ugly 41-6 loss to Nazareth on Friday. Aside from one player, East Stroudsburg North struggled to move the ball offensively. The team managed to rush the ball for 202 yards, 160 of which came from quarterback Thomas Melchiorre. Joey Brown, who has done well since replacing an injured Jacob Clouse earlier this season, picked up the second-most yardage for the Timberwolves with 38 yards on 10 carries. The Timberwolves didn't do themselves any favors either, fumbling the ball twice and losing it once, leading directly to a Nazareth touchdown. ES North's defense could not stop Nazareth's offense either, allowing the Blue Eagles to rush for 240 yards and pass for another 110. Nazareth's leading receiver Jahan Dotson showed once again why all eyes are on him as of late. The sophomore made six catches for 52 yards and three touchdowns Friday night, including a beautiful 20-yard reception in the left corner of the end zone on a floater from quarterback Travis Stefanik. Stefanik had a great night himself, rushing for 114 yards and two touchdowns and going 11-for-14 for 110 yards and three touchdowns in the air. The Timberwolves faced three very good teams in consecutive weeks, going against Stroudsburg, Bethlehem Catholic and Nazareth all in a row. They kept the first two of those games in check, remaining competitive and showing they could put up a fight. Friday night was a different story, but East Stroudsburg North will regroup and move on to Pleasant Valley this week in Bushkill. - Zach Sturniolo Pleasant Valley 42, Dieruff 20 Dieruff 0 14 6 0 -- 20 Pleasant Valley 0 21 7 14 – 42 Second quarter PV – Danny Hunter 61 pass from Brandon Keyes (Dean Krcic kick) PV – Austyn Borre 5 run (Krcic kick) D – Brian Sutton INT return 20 yards (Justin Ewell kick) D – Jon Jackson 8 pass from Nizayah Speaks (Ewell kick) PV – Justin Richardson 28 pass from Keyes (Krcic kick) Third quarter D – Devonte Robinson 75 run (kick failed) PV – Hunter 8 pass from Keyes (Krcic kick) Fourth quarter PV – Borre 1 run (Krcic kick) PV – BJ Olaniyan INT return 62 yards (Krcic kick) Team Statistics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:27:43.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
