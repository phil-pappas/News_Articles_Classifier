Quarterback Dillon Adam hit Robbie Neall on a long throw and catch down inside the 5-yard line where Kolbi Wright ran it in three yards for a touchdown. The Richard Carey kick made it 15-7 with 1:09 left to play in the first half. \nAnd then to quote the late Gonzo journalist Hunter Thompson, “When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.” \nA short kick spinning like a top toward the Central sidelines was scooped up by Kendrique Nocks who stayed true through defensive traffic before busting loose for a 68-yard touchdown run. \nNocks became a “Knock Knock” no joke in the Cape end zone when he intercepted a Dillon Adams pass on the next possession and returned it 50 yards for his second touchdown in 25 seconds without playing offense, some kind of homecoming record for certain. \nSturgis scored again on a 67-yard run on his first touch of the third quarter to give the Knights a 34-7 lead. \nCape dropped to 3-2 on the nine-game schedule and will host Dover (3-2) Friday, Oct. 16.
