In an effort to soothe tensions, Netanyahu's office announced that the Temple Mount, which seems like the perennial flashpoint of Jewish-Arab violence in the Holy Land, will be off limits to Jewish members of parliament as well as government ministers.\nHerzog said that the premier's edict banning Jewish lawmakers from Temple Mount should have been issued \"months ago\" so as to \"remove extremists from the Temple Mount and stop politicians from going up there.\"\nThe opposition chief said that the fatal stabbings in the Old City were only a matter of time given the tense atmosphere that took hold over the capital.\n\"The writing was on the wall for a long time,\" Herzog said.\nHerzog's No. 2, Zionist Union MK Tzipi Livni, said on Thursday that Netanyahu promised Jordan a year ago to bar Jewish lawmakers from visiting the Temple Mount.\n\"It is wrong of him to only implement the decision now,\" the former minister said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:25:34.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
