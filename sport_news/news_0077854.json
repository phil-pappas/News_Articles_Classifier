The Rangers also lost right-hander Lisalverto Bonilla on a waiver claim to the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nTexas has 38 players on its 40-man roster after all those moves. \nBlanks, Corporan and Richardson could refuse the assignment and become free agents. \nDarvish, who missed the season after undergoing Tommy John surgery in spring training, remains on the 60-day DL along with infielder Jurickson Profar and pitchers Alex Claudio and Nick Tepesch. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:36:55.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
