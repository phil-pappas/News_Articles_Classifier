ESU (13-3, 8-1) secures a top-two seed in the PSAC Tournament and can clinch the No. 1 seed with a win over Slippery Rock on October 31. ESU and Millersville (16-1, 8-1) are tied for first in the PSAC standings, with the Warriors holding the tiebreaker by virtue of a 1-0 win vs. the Marauders on October 13. Roth scored the game’s first goal 3:21 in the second half before Morgan Aldinger converted a penalty stroke for Kutztown (12-5, 7-3) to make it 1-1 with 25:25 remaining in the contest. Roth scored both of her goals off penalty corners, assisted by senior midfielder Rebecca Snyder. She has 16 goals this season and 69 in her four-year career at ESU, which includes consecutive first team All-America selections (2013, 2014) and the 2014 PSAC Offensive Athlete of the Year. ESU held a 21-7 advantage in shots, a 14-3 margin in shots on goal and a 10-5 edge in penalty corners. Kayla Denlinger made 11 saves for Kutztown, and junior goalkeeper Danielle Ard had two saves for the Warriors. ESU avenged a 1-0 home loss to Kutztown in a non-conference game on September 12. Kutztown fell to a No. 1-ranked team for the second time this week. The Golden Bears dropped a 4-1 decision at co-No. 1 Millersville on Wednesday, while ESU fell 1-0 at No. 5 Shippensburg to end a nine-game winning streak. The Warriors, second in last week’s NCAA DII regional poll which selects the three regional participants in the NCAA DII Tournament field, travel to LIU Post for a non-conference game on Monday before hosting Slippery Rock (currently 5-11, 2-7) on Saturday at 1 p.m. A win over SRU would give ESU the No. 1 seed as the host of the PSAC semifinals and final. The Warriors earned a first-round bye with Saturday night’s win. Millersville hosts Mansfield (0-15, 0-9) next Saturday and will also be a top-two seed.
