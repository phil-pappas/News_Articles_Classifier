With the win, the Northmen (5-2) hold sole possession of second place in the Big North, while the Blue Devils (5-2) drop their second straight league game. \"It was a great game,” Petoskey coach Kerry VanOrman said. “Both teams played their hearts out. They had a chance in the end, but our defense stepped up and made a play. For coming off a tough loss last week in overtime, I think that this was a win we needed. The kids stuck in there and I am just real proud of them.\" Petoskey hosts Alpena next Friday, while Gaylord welcomes in Traverse City West.
