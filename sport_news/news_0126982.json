Gillins will remain at wide receiver for now before his position is re-evaluated at the end of the season. \nUW announced Saturday before the Purdue game that Gillins, a reserve quarterback, had practiced at wide receiver that week and could contribute on special teams. \n“D.J. came to me and said, ‘I want to be able to help this team, and I don’t feel like I’m doing it right now,’ ” Chryst said. “I appreciate that. I told him, ‘It’s something I’m on board with for the rest of the season, and then let’s visit again.’ \n“He’s a natural athlete. He was a heck of a basketball player, a heck of a competitor. I’m looking forward to seeing how it plays out. I really don’t know exactly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:24:51.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
