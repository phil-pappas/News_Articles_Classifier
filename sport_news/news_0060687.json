Kings left-winger Milan Lucic, 17, breaks away as Vancouver Canucks left-winger Alex Burrows, 14, and defenceman Dan Hamhuis, 2, give chase during the second period in Los Angeles on Tuesday. — The Associated Press Photograph by: Alex Gallardo , AP \nSo, the Canucks have picked up where they left off last regular season. \nSurprise. \nGood lesson. Probably a solid idea to never write off a team with the Sedins up front and Chris Tanev and Alex Edler carrying the rearguard before a season even begins. \nBut anyone daydreaming about another 100 points should know this: These Canucks are nothing like last year’s. At least, not now. \nThose Canucks were braided together like frayed horsehair rope. There were veterans up and down the lineup. The enlightening rookie, Bo Horvat, couldn’t get himself off the fourth line or on the power play. \nThe 2011 era was long gone. But games still had a sense you were on a tour of Jurassic World. It was one last run for the old days. And, you know what, it wasn’t half bad. \nThe way those Canucks went out, however, was cathartic, taking us to terminus. It was an end. The group could still be good, it was never going to be good enough. \nSince, Vancouver has responded exactly how it should have responded. Doors were left ajar for youth. Several young players walked on through. \nJust like that, a season that once lacked any expectancy tingled with intrigue, anticipation and even promise. \nThe first four games haven’t disappointed. Goalie Ryan Miller has done what he was signed to do, steadying a team in transition,peppered with inexperience. \nThe Sedins have shown enough that we know they aren’t done as first-liners. The top defensive pairing of Edler and Tanev is emerging as a duo that can possibly carry a top six that is as vulnerable as it’s been in a decade. If the Canucks are going to continue to keep themselves above water they will need Edler and Tanev steering the boat. So far, they’ve been great at that. \nBut this remains a team in search of an identity, like so many others in October. \nWill they really be all-in on the youth movement they need to drive them forward? \nOr will they increasingly give plum responsibilities to players like Brandon Prust, and, when he comes back, Chris Higgins? \nIt’s not easy for any coach to stomach inexperience, especially when those young players ratchet up the risk of goals against. \nThere was a great quote from Toronto head coach Mike Babcock on Wednesday. He said it is easy to overplay checking-type players because they don’t get scored on. \nA coach’s inherent tendency is usually to be as safe as possible. \nIt is hard to put your patience and faith in players like Sven Baertschi, Jake Virtanen and Jared McCann, because you know what it could mean for Miller and the scoreboard. \nAlready you can sense the team is at least a little conflicted, as the Canucks’ coaching staff works out just how far it’s willing to go down this road. \nBaertschi, admittedly quiet, has already found himself on the fourth line and in Tuesday’s win in L.A., McCann was scratched andVirtanen was benched three-fifths into the game. \nThe team’s three rookies have yet to play in the same game. \nThere is nothing wrong with any of this. They need to learn and if you learn playing a game or two on the fourth line, so be it. Just as long as that spot in the top six is waiting for you soon enough. \nThe team does still have a foot in the old days, and still finds itself at a fork in the road this season. \nWill this be the year they commit to the new generation, mistakes be damned, over the course of 82 games? \nThere is a lot of unknown diving into that end of the pool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:39:01.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
