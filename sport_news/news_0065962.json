But certainly, we follow young players in China, as we do in all markets, very closely,” he said. \n“Zhou played a very important role in helping China win the Asian Championship and qualify for the (2016) Olympics. I think only time will tell whether he will be a true NBA prospect, we are encouraged by what we have seen so far and look forward to watching him continue to develop as a player.” \nIn addition to bringing games to China, Silver revealed last Saturday that the league has discussed the possibility of playing some games at about 10am on the United States east coast to better accommodate Chinese fans. \n“The main interest is to give fans the ability to watch games during prime time in the evening here. I think we will experiment with it at some point to get a sense of how much it will increase our viewership. \n“I will say I am a little concerned about our players’ performance levels because their body clocks are used to playing in the evening or afternoon. But as viewership continues to grow here, it’s something inevitably that we will take a stronger look at,” he added. \nThe league’s increasing presence on all media platforms in China seems to provide a compelling argument for such an adjustment. \nThe 2014-15 NBA season was watched by more than 690 million television viewers in China, while the average number of viewers per game during the playoffs reached 2.3 million on Tencent across all platforms — a whopping 160 percent increase over the previous season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:41:42.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
