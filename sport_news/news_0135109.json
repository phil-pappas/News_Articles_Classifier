(By: MARK STALLINGS) (Credit: Special to the NWA Democrat-Gazette) \nThe Bulldogs shut down a potent Bryant offense, pulling away in the second half for a 38-7 7A/6A-Central victory at Smith-Robinson Stadium. \nGreenwood (7-0, 4-0) improved to 6-0 against Class 7A teams. \n\"It was good win for us,\" Greenwood Coach Rick Jones said. \"I thought we played hard in all three phases. I challenge both the offensive and defensive lines to not take step back. I wanted them moving forward and never going backward.\" \nThe Bulldogs' defense limited Bryant to 249 total yards and 12 first downs. The Hornets had the 7A/6A-Central 's best rushing attack coming into the game but managed only 128. \n\"I cannot say enough about our defense, because Bryant is so scary offensively,\" Jones said. \"They do so many things well. They are down to their third tailback. Still, they are so fast and the quarterback can run and throw.\" \nAfter struggling through much of the first half, Greenwood finished the game with 501 total yards, including 392 on the ground. Caden Martin and Daylon Hood, usually backup running backs, shined with each gaining more than 100 yards rushing and combining for 5 touchdowns. \n\"Our line blocked well up front, but our receivers were blocking downfield as well,\" Jones said. \"I thought we executed very well. We got physical with them and tried to play very fast. \n\"We like to think that if an opponent takes away the pass, then we will run it. The key is to be good enough to run or pass even when they know what is coming.\" \nGreenwood held Bryant to three first downs 102 total yards in the first half, with 77 of that coming on two passes on the Hornets' touchdown drive early in the first quarter. The Bulldogs limited the Hornets to 25 rushing yards on 13 carries in the first half. \n\"It takes a lot of preparation to get ready for [Bryant],\" Jones said. \"We stopped counting at 96 different formations and then they come out in something different in three separate plays early. We made a few adjustments after that.\" \nQuarterback Gunnar Burns hit Austin Kelly for a 54-yard pass, then again on the next play for a 23-yard touchdown to give Bryant a 7-0 lead with 9:01 in the first quarter. \nGreenwood took control of the game in the second quarter thanks two Caden Martin touchdowns to open a 17-3 halftime lead. \nThe Bulldogs completely dominated the second half, scoring on their first three possessions to blow open the game. \nSports on 10/17/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:08.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
