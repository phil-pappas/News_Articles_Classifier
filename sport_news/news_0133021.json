It came at 15:56 of the second period. The Stars beat Tampa 5-3. \nMcKenzie needed assistance from the ice and appeared to be unable to put weight on his leg as he headed toward the locker room from the bench. The Stars said McKenzie had a game-ending lower body injury and was taken to an area hospital. \nThe 22-year-old Nesterov will forfeit $7,983 in salary to go to the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund.
