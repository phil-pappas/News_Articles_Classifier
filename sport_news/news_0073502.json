And he wasn’t the only one. Senior holder and reserve quarterback Brad Kragthorpe, another walk-on and a son of former LSU assistant coach Steve Kragthorpe, who remains on staff in a non-coaching position, was also in on it. \n“Me and Brad joked about it all week. ‘What if we run the fake?’ Because we didn’t think we had a chance of running it,” Domingue said. \nCareful what you kid about, young grasshopper. \nSuddenly, Miles — on intel by his twenty something advisors — called it. It was fourth-and-13 from the Florida 16-yard line early in the fourth quarter with the scored tied, 28-28, and the Gators in possession of most of the momentum after outscoring the Tigers 14-0 in the third quarter for the tie. Not for long. \nIt is not a reach to say that none of the 102,321 in the stadium or the Florida coaches or any players on either side — other than a precious and precocious few — knew what was coming next. \n“I thought they were going for the field goal,” LSU linebacker Deion Jones said. “We all did. It was fourth and long. Then all of a sudden, people started screaming. I look up, and Trent’s hauling up the sideline. It got me. I was shocked.” \nThe element of surprise was there because of the situation. The Tigers were facing fourth and 13. Surely, they weren’t going to fake it, the Gators were likely thinking. It was too many yards. \n“It was a heck of a call, a gutsy call,” Florida coach Jim McElwain said. “That was pretty awesome.” \nWhen Miles last faked a field goal against Florida on Oct. 9, 2010, it was fourth-and-three at the Florida 36 with the Gators up 29-26 and just 35 seconds left. And Miles had just used a timeout. At the very end of the timeout, he told holder Derek Helton and kicker Josh Jasper to run the fake. Few others on LSU’s side knew. Some on the Florida sideline were expecting a fake in that game because of the situation — short yardage, late in the game. But Helton’s over-the-shoulder flip to Jasper worked anyway as Jasper gathered in the bouncing ball and gained five for the first down. Seconds later, quarterback Jarrett Lee hit Terrence Toliver for a 3-yard touchdown with six seconds to go for the 33-29 LSU win. \nMiles’ last fake in any game was also in short yardage — a fourth-and-goal at the 2 against Notre Dame late in the first half in the Music City Bowl last season, and Kragthorpe was tackled just short of the touchdown. The fake against South Carolina in 2007 came on fourth-and-four from the Gamecocks’ 15 with holder Matt Flynn flipping the ball over his shoulder to kicker Colt David, who scored untouched for a 21-7 second quarter lead in a 28-16 win. \nThis was fourth and long, and there was another reason not to expect a fake. There were nearly 11 minutes to play in the game. LSU could take a 31-28 lead, play defense and score again. If Florida scored, LSU still had plenty of time. So, Florida edge players Vernon Hargreaves, Antonio Morrison and Marcus Maye sold out on a rush from Domingue’s left side to block the kick, and it was too late to catch Domingue once they realized it was a fake. They didn’t contain as players often do on fourth-and-short field goal attempts. Domingue had all green to run as he bobbled the ball three times before finally gathering it in. \n“My heart was fluttering with each bobble,” Miles said. So was Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh’s earlier in the day, but his punter never got the ball back after bobbling and fumbling a snap that Michigan State recovered and scored on the game’s final play to beat Miles’ former team. \n“When I saw him bobble it, my heart dropped,” LSU quarterback Brandon Harris said. “If that ball would have hit the ground, I would have hit the ground with it,” Miles said. \nAnd the Mad Hatter’s little hats’ play calling days may have been over. \n“We’re not throwing that think unless you master it,” Miles – the Master Po of fakes – kept telling his eager grasshoppers in recent weeks as they begged to use it. “They did.” \nAnd they were prepared. \n“We could have checked out of it if we hadn’t gotten the look we wanted,” Domingue said. But Kragthorpe, who called for the snap, and Domingue read the right formation for the fake. \n“We got the look,” said Domingue, who may have a coaching career ahead of him like Miles before him. “They call Coach Miles the Mad Hatter for a reason.” \nMiles and Domingue are not always big on details – unless it’s fake preparation. Domingue remembered his crucial conversation with Miles and critical read of Florida’s defense, but he doesn’t clearly remember scoring the touchdown. \n“I really kind of blacked out for a second,” he said. “But I just kept running after I finally caught it. I actually don’t remember getting to the end zone. I think I blacked out. I’m not really sure what happened after.” \nLSU won, little hatter. \nNOTES: The Tigers (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) moved up one spot to No. 5 in the nation in the Associated Press poll on Sunday as the only undefeated SEC team and remained at No. 5 in the USA Today poll. … LSU hosts Western Kentucky (6-1, 4-0 Conference USA) at 6 p.m. Saturday on ESPNU in Tiger Stadium. … The Tigers will be open the next Saturday on Oct. 31 before playing at No. 8 Alabama (6-1, 3-1 SEC) on Nov. 7. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/2015/10/18/fake-kicks-run-family-lsu/74186492/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:01:05.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
