That's why, according to Dan Graziano of ESPN, Coughlin told his players the Bills would beat themselves with penalties. Sure enough, the Bills committed 17 penalties for 135 yards on their way to a 24-10 loss Sunday.\nTom Coughlin told his players before Sunday's game that the Bills would beat themselves with penalties. They committed 17 for 135 yards.\n— Dan Graziano (@DanGrazianoESPN) October 4, 2015 The Giants had 11 penalties of their own, but the Bills' penalties proved more costly. Not only did Buffalo have two penalties that negated touchdowns, but it was also called for four 15-yard penalties. Defensive end Jerry Hughes was flagged for two personal fouls.\n\"We'll look at the film and see where the penalties were,\" Hughes said. \"Can't really comment on the penalties until we see the film and see what they look like.\"\nWhile the Bills think they are developing a reputation with the officials and getting flagged more often than other teams, the reputation they need to worry about is the one that is allowing other teams to take advantage of their emotional style of play.\nIn their two losses, the Bills have a combined 31 penalties for 275 yards. They're doing as good a job beating themselves as any other team has been able to do.\n» Related: Rex Ryan proud of team despite penalties", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DanGrazianoESPN/status/650789055987224576"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:15:08.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
