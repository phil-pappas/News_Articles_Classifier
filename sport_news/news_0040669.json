The pros and cons of an icy cold one after exercise\nWhen Mr. Dunn was 15, his family moved from Vermont to France, and every weekend he and his brother and their dad would ride bikes and explore the countryside. Back in the U.S., while Mr. Dunn attended Colorado State University in Fort Collins, he raced on the ski team. Then, for graduation, his parents bought him a road bike. “It’s hard to ski race after college, so I decided it was time to embrace a new sport,” he says.\n“I didn’t know how to train,” Mr. Dunn recalls. “I just showed up at races and tried to be fast.” He gravitated to criterium racing, which involves riding a bike on circuits around a closed course of one mile or less in length. The multi-lap races, usually ranging from 25 to 60 miles, are extremely fast. “The speed and the tight corners reminded me a lot of ski racing,” Mr. Dunn says.\nAfter five years of road racing, he branched out to mountain biking and cyclocross, where riders complete multiple laps on a 1½-to-2 mile course featuring wooded trails, pavement and grass, as well as obstacles or steep hills that require the rider to dismount and carry the bike. A cyclocross bike has gear shifts and drop-bar handle bars like a road bike, and knobby tires similar to a mountain bike. Cyclocross races usually last about an hour.\nMr. Dunn, now 52, says his 18-year-old twin sons, Cormac and Liam, keep him race fit. Both are competitive riders on the Clif Bar Development Mountain Bike and Cyclocross Team. There are a few ex-national champions on the Great Divide team, Mr. Dunn says, “and we’re competitive in the state.”\nBrian Dunn and his sons Liam, left, and Cormac, at Lookout Mountain in Golden, Colo., where they do cyclocross training rides together.

For me, that’s being outside and going on a three-hour bike ride that lets me take in 55 miles worth of mountains or countryside.”\nThe Workout When ski season ends around mid-April, Mr. Dunn starts training, with two-hour road rides on weekends, eventually ramping up to three- and four-hour rides in May. By late May, he starts entering weekend road races. Depending on the weather and his work schedule, he tries to get in one- or 1½-hour rides a couple of times a week from May through October. “I ride hills as much as I can and try to keep the effort reasonably high so I get something out if it,” he says. “Hard climbing and screaming descents are the sorts of rides I like most.”\nIn summer he also takes his mountain bike out at least once a week. “It’s really nice to get off the road and into remote places,” he says. When he can, he fits an early-evening ride with friends or teammates into his weeknight schedule. He rides with his sons when they are home from college; usually they ride from their house to the Cherry Creek Reservoir, which is about a 40-mile ride. Sometimes they climb Lookout Mountain, a more than 7,370-foot peak near Denver. “We start together but we don’t finish together,” Mr. Dunn says.\nCyclocross season starts in September. Mr. Dunn usually races from September into December. He tries to compete in races on Wednesday nights and weekends. He says the older he gets, the more he is getting into cyclocross. “Road racing is more dangerous,” he says. “If you crash on a road bike going 30 miles per hour you can really get hurt. If you flip off a trail during cyclocross, you’re going slower and land in mud, not on pavement.”\nMr. Dunn dislikes riding indoors on a trainer or spin bike. In winter, he stays fit by alpine skiing one or two days a week. “I always ski hard and take lots of nonstop runs,” he says. He also does hot yoga one or two times a week. “The one-legged exercises are really good for keeping knees healthy and strong,” he says.\nThe Diet Mornings start with granola and fruit. Mr. Dunn packs a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on whole wheat bread and a piece of fruit for lunch, or sometimes goes with turkey or salami. Dinner at home is cooked on the grill. Often it is steak, fish, chicken or burgers, accompanied by a lot of vegetables and a pasta dish. Mr. Dunn usually ends a ride with a beer—“even before I take a shower,” he says. Because of Colorado’s dry climate, Mr. Dunn says he always tries to drink two full bottles of water during rides and two pints of water afterward.\nThe Gear Mr. Dunn had the Great Divide logo put on Pearl Izumi bike jerseys. He says race entry fees average $30 to $40. He wears Giro road bike shoes and Sidi mountain bike shoes and he has a Giro helmet. His Niner BSB 9 RDO Cyclocross bike cost $6,950, by the time he customized it with pedals, a saddle and other parts. As for his mountain bike, a Ninver AIR 9 RDO, it cost $7,180 after he added tires and other parts. His Cannondale SuperSix EVO Hi-MOD road bike cost $6,420 after he customized it.\nWrite to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR139_1012wo_M_20151007184316.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR139_1012wo_H_20151007184316.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR139_1012wo_P_20151007184316.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:59:40.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
