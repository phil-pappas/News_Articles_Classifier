Farrell Schalmont earns top seed 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Rotterdam\nIn each of the past two seasons, the Schalmont boys' soccer team has seen its season end in the Section II Class B championship against rival Ichabod Crane .\nLast year was especially heartbreaking for the Sabres as they dropped a 2-1 decision in double overtime, but that loss has served as a big motivator for the squad.\n\"From the beginning of the season, Ichabod Crane has been on our minds,\" Schalmont senior Cameron LaVallee said.\nAfter completing a 16-0 regular season, the Sabres, ranked No. 2 in the state, earned the No. 1 seed in this year's Class B sectional tournament.\n\"I knew this year, this team could do big things,\" LaVallee said. \"I think this team deserves it.\"\nSchalmont was young last season as coach Jason Beck had a number of freshmen and sophomores on his roster, but that group has a year of experience under its belt and Beck said his team has worked exceptionally hard to get to where it is now.\n\"The group I have is nearly the same as last year,\" he said. \"We've been working hard. We've put in the extra effort and it shows.\"\nSchalmont opens sectional play at 2:15 p.m. Friday against the winner of Wednesday's opening-round game between No. 16 Johnstown and No. 17 Fonda.\n\"They can both score goals and defend well,\" Beck said. \"We need to focus on our game and what we do well.\"\nIn addition to Schalmont, Ballston Spa (Class AA), Scotia (A), Maple Hill (C) and Fort Ann (D) earned No. 1 seeds in their respective classes.\nIn the girls' tournament, Shenendehowa (Class AA), Scotia (A), Schalmont (B), Schoharie (C) and Oppenheim-Ephratah-St. Johnsville (D) are the top seeds.\nShould the Schalmont boys' squad advance to the championship game, it could very well meet up with Ichabod Crane, the No. 2 seed.\nThe Riders (13-3) have won the past three sectional titles.\nSchalmont and Ichabod Crane met twice in the regular season. The Sabres came out with a 1-0 win on Sept. 22 and a 5-1 win on Oct. 13.\n\"I feel like we can beat them a third time,\" LaVallee said. \"After playing them twice, we know more about them.\"\nSchalmont's opponents will be faced with the daunting task of trying to limit the Sabres' offense.\nSchalmont has outscored its opponents 129-7 this season and is paced by senior Chris Hamilton (43 goals, 11 assists), LaVallee (26-22) and junior RJ Hayden (12-11).\n\"We're finishing our opportunities,\" Beck said. \"Our midfield has created a lot of opportunities for our strikers to score.\"\nThe Sabres' defense has also been strong, including junior Zach Ericson and sophomore Dan DiCocco . Junior goalie Franco Viscusi hasn't been tested much this year, but Beck said, \"It's nice to have extra insurance with him in goal.\"\nAs Schalmont begins its quest for its first sectional title since 2007, it will be sporting a big target on its back, but the Sabres have accepted it.\n\"We accept it, recognize it and we'll try to work through it,\" Beck said.\nLaVallee said, \"Everyone has to work hard. If we keep doing what we're doing, I think we can go very far in the tournament.\"\njkoehler@timesunion.com 518-454-5411 @JKoehlerTU", "external_links": ["http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676632/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676626/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676631/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676626/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676631/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676632/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676631/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676626/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/24/8676632/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:34:26.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
