At the end of the season, only Willie Rodriguez caught up scoring 11.8 per game. After a long eight months of rehabilitation and the frustration of missing the second half of the season and having to watch his teammates play without him, Perovic is back healthy and ready to contribute. \"It feels great. I can't describe how actually happy I am to be back on the court, back with my teammates, it feels amazing,\" Perovic said. \"After all the tough 8 months with the rehab and everything, to be on the court again, it's just amazing.\" \"Dusan's biggest is that versatility. He gives us size in there, he stretches the defense,\" said Head Coach Tommy Dempsey. \"When he's on the court and he's at 22 feet, they're guarding him which opens lanes for Walker, McFadden, Rodriguez, those guys get to the basket. John Schurman's another guy that spaces the court. I think we really have a much better balance of inside out and Dusan will help provide that.\" The Bearcats open the season on the road against St. Bonaventure on November 14th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:33:11.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
