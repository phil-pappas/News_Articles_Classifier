(USC SID) -- The University of South Carolina football team, under interim head coach Shawn Elliott worked out for about 90 minutes on Thursday afternoon at the new Gamecock Park practice fields. The Gamecocks (2-4, 0-4 SEC) are preparing for Saturday’s SEC Eastern Division battle with the Vanderbilt Commodores (2-3, 0-2 SEC). The annual Homecoming game is set for a 4 p.m. kick and will be televised on the SEC Network.Vanderbilt will present the Carolina defense with a challenge. “They’re a balanced football team,” said co-defensive coordinator Jon Hoke. “They run the ball, they run it well and they’re throwing it. They’ve kind of opened it up a little more lately with the quarterback. They know what they’re doing, there’s no question about it,” continued Hoke. “They’re going to try to out-formation you to get you out of alignment and in the wrong position.”Hoke indicated that the players have bounced back from the news earlier in the week of Coach Spurrier stepping down. “I’m sure it was a little tough early, but the last few days have been terrific days of practice,” said Hoke. “They seem to be locked in, have their jaws set and are ready to go. I think they’re ready to go out and play a game of football.”Hoke, who was brought in this season by Coach Spurrier has a long relationship with the Head Ball Coach and was surprised by this week’s events. “It was tough, there’s no question. We’ve known each other a long time. We’ve had good discussion and I understand totally where he’s at. (Interim head) coach (Shawn) Elliott is doing a wonderful job with the group,” Hoke added. “The transition is never easy, but he’s done a nice job with it.”The Gamecocks will hold their usual walk-thru on Friday afternoon in Williams-Brice Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:21:02.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
