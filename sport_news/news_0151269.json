(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) Wake is so overmatched that the Seminoles’ biggest competition in a game in which it has jumped to a 20-point favorite may come from the weather.\nAlthough it appears Hurricane Joaquin will spare the eastern seaboard, the area is expected to be pounded by rain. Winston-Salem is under a flash flood warming until Sunday and some areas of North Carolina are bracing for up to 16 inches of rain.\nThe last time the Seminoles dealt with weather issues (three weeks ago against South Florida), Dalvin Cook ran for a career best 266 yards. Florida State may rely on Cook and its running game once again, but it would like to see improvement from quarterback Everett Golson and the offensive line after a very pedestrian performance two weeks ago at Boston College. The offense scored one touchdown in the 14-0 victory and totaled 217 yards, 83 coming in its first drive.\nHans Pennink Wake Forest quarterback John Wolford (10) leaves the game limping later to return while playing against Army during an NCAA college football game on Saturday, Sept. 19, 2015. His status for Saturday’s game against FSU is uncertain. (AP Photo/Hans Pennink) FSU coach Jimbo Fisher, whose team is looking to extend its ACC winning streak to 26 games, was asked about the offense’s progress during the open week.\n“I thought it was really good,” he said. “We were physical, got better.… worked a lot of things. We’ll find out.”\nWhile the Seminoles have gotten off to a slow start offensively, the same cannot be said for a defense that is in the top 10 in the nation in scoring defense (6th, 10.0 ppg), total defense (8th, 256.3 ypg) and passing yards allowed (4th, 116.3).\n“There’s things that appear to be open and these guys run and pursue so well that the holes just get closed up,” Clawson said. “And their pursuit in the secondary is great. It’s really hard to make big plays against them.”\nSaid tackle Nile Lawrence-Stample: “I think our team is really malleable. I think we can form it and it’ll go to the beat of the drum.”\nThat defense is expected to receive a boost from the return of 6-foot-7, 229-pound sophomore defensive end Lorenzo Featherston, a projected starter who has not played since suffering a knee injury midway through preseason camp.\nThe Seminoles are not sure if they will see more of sophomore quarterback John Wolford, who missed Wake’s 31-24 loss to Indiana last week because of an ankle injury, or true freshman Kendall Hinton, who threw for 245 yards against Indiana, a school record for a quarterback making his first career start.\nClawson said Wolford will be the starter when he is healthy but did not say if that would be this week.\nNo matter the quarterback, the Demon Deacons have had success throwing the ball, leading the ACC with 300.0 passing yards per game.\n“They are going to spread, they are going to throw a lot of the different concepts,” Fisher said. “They throw a lot of the same concepts we do: They will be in three wide, four wide, empties, different personnel formations. We have to be able to pressure the passer. We have to be able to affect him.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/02/ce/6f/Wake-Forest-Army-Football.J.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/02/fe/69/488964108.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-02T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:26:49.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
