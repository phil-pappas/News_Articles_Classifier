I probably missed the first 21 games if I remember, but I had to do it. I had to do it back then because I felt like I was disrespected with the offer they offered me. I don't really know what's going on with Tristan right now with numbers and stuff. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty confident that he will be here soon.\" \nAlthough the Cavaliers must continue waiting for a few more hours to find out whether or not Thompson signs the offer sheet, to those in uniform, the situation is a non-factor in their preparation for the 2015-2016 season. \n\"First things first, we understand that this is a business,\" Cavaliers small forward James Jones said. \"Once the business is taken care of, you can come in and you can work on the floor. Until that's resolved, he's handling his business and we support him 100 percent. At the same time, the guys that are here, we're working and we have a goal and a mission, and we're not going to let anything stop us from focusing and just staying on course. \n\"As players, we can't control these things. The only thing we can control is playing. For the guys in this locker room, we're focused on getting better. We're focused on this upcoming season, getting healthier, building some chemistry and being ready to embark on a long season. Once you take care of the business and all the guys are here, we'll huddle up and we'll make adjustments. For now, we're just playing ball.\" \nIn 2013-2014, Thompson was a starting power forward for the Cavaliers averaging 11.7 points and 9.2 rebounds over 31.6 minutes of play. But with the acquisitions of small forward LeBron James and power forward Kevin Love last offseason, Thompson saw his minutes drop by nearly five per game. He still averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds in a reserve role. \nDuring his 20 postseason games last year, Thompson averaged 9.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in the absence of Love, who suffered a season-ending shoulder dislocation during a Game 4 win over the Boston Celtics in the opening round of the postseason. \nDespite currently missing Thompson, one of their key cogs from last season's playoff run, the Cavaliers are focused on the task of preparing for the challenges that lie ahead. \n\"I think this year's practices are much more focused,\" Jones said. \"We don't have a lot of chatter. We don't have a lot of distractions, and we don't have to go searching for guys to get them on the court to start practice. Guys are here early, and they're locked in. They're adjusting well. \n\"We're coaching ourselves because we have a better grasp, and it's great when you see young players, who don't have as much experience, when you see them mature over the course of a matter of months to take a leadership role, it's gratifying because we know that we'll need those guys to do anything special.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1KQ6GHW TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:41:56.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
