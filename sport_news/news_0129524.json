By CHRIS CASEY ccasey @shawmedia.com \nWEST CHICAGO – It had been quite a while since a Geneva boys golf team punched its ticket to the IHSA state tournament. In fact, it had only happened once in school history. \nThat was before Monday’s Class 3A St. Charles East Sectional at St. Andrews Golf Club. The freshmen were at it again, as Jack McDonald shot a 72, with Upstate Eight Conference River Division Player of the Year Tyler Isenhart right behind with a 73, to send Geneva boys golf to the state tournament for the first time since 1989. \nGeneva coach Eric Hatczel had seen the two youngsters help carry the Vikings during the regular season, and even to a school-record 292 round at last week’s Larkin Regional, but to lead the program to its first state bid in 26 years came off as impressive. \n“It’s phenomenal. I mean, what a wonderful feeling,” Hatczel said. “Jack and Tyler have been so consistent for us this whole year, and to be freshman is great. I also think it’s nice to have kids that young because with this being such an adrenaline rush, they are almost immune to the pressure. It’s great.” \nGeneva had a team goal coming into Monday of shooting under 300, and while the Vikings tallied that exact score, with Andrew Abel (76) and JT Kruzich (79) rounding out the scoring, it didn’t matter as Geneva finished third, which meant the entire team will have one more weekend together The Den at Fox Creek Golf Course in Bloomington starting this Friday. \nComing into a sectional as a freshman brought some pressure for McDonald, whether he wanted to admit it or not. Almost finishing as the medalist, one shot behind Benet’s Nick Schanzer, McDonald had quite the start to his round Monday, to subside some of that adrenaline. \n“I mean, I started with five birdies on the front nine, so that kind of calmed me down,” McDonald said. “(Coach) was out there and telling us some of the scores, so I knew that we had a chance to do it. But bottom line is that we are going to state and that’s really all we wanted to do and all that matters.” \nSt. Andrews also hosted the UEC Tournament, so many Geneva golfers, as well as those from the other Tri-Cities schools, were used to playing there. As Monday’s final groups came in, the wind was beginning to pick up, but fortunately for the Vikings, McDonald, Isenhart and company had all but cemented their spot for next weekend. \nSeveral other schools fell victim to what many coaches and players joked as a miniature state tournament at this sectional. \nNeuqua Valley’s 296 took home the title, while three-time defending state champion Hinsdale Central finished second with a 299. \nSt. Charles East’s Danny Buetow and Marmion’s Nick Huggins were in a group of five golfers that shot a 4-over 76 and more golf was required to fill the remaining three spots for qualifying individuals. \nBoth Buetow and Huggins, who went to state as a sophomore last year, made par on the first playoff hole, hole No. 1, while the other three bogeyed, meaning both qualified for state. \nWith sectionals already providing the pressure of a golfer’s potential last round of the season, Buetow said he wasn’t going to let the playoff hole be the last one he’d shoot this fall. \n“I just kept telling myself that I was going to do it and go to state,” Buetow said. “It was definitely nerve-racking a little bit, but I’m not sure what I would’ve done if I didn’t make it. It means the world to me and I can’t wait for next weekend.” \nHuggins will be accompanied by Cadets coach Doug Roberts, who knew his team had an outside shot to make state as a team, but with the loaded field, Roberts knew Marmion would have to have one of its better rounds of the season. \nA 317, two strokes ahead of East, Marmion was not quite enough to catch the likes of Geneva. \n“We knew it was possible, but we needed some guys to shoot great rounds and needed some help as well,” Roberts said. “We knew schools like Geneva were playing really well, and Neuqua and Hinsdale are always very strong, so it was tough. We’re definitely happy to have Nick Huggins go to state to represent us and, even though he wishes some of the seniors could be there with him, he’s happy to get this chance again.” \nSt. Charles North and Batavia did not qualify as teams for Monday’s sectional, but the individuals who advanced did not advance to state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:03:01.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
