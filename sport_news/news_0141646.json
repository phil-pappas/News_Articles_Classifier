(AP) - LSU's infield just got a little thinner.\nCoach Paul Mainieri says sophomore infielder/catcher Bryce Jordan will miss the remainder of fall ball after tearing his meniscus while playing catch Wednesday.\nMainieri on Friday told The Advocate ( http://bit.ly/1LYqMlG ) Jordan will have surgery Monday. He's expected to be fully recovered by the spring.\nMainieri says the injury will require about six weeks of recovery.\nBefore fall practice began Sunday, Mainieri said Jordan and junior college transfer Bryce Adams were the leading contenders at first base. LSU needs to replace every infielder from last year's team, and Mainieri said losing Jordan for the fall may slightly change how he handles the infield competition.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
