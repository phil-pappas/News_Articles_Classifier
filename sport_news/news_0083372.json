Officials say the car was airborne and rolled several times before James Gallimore was thrown out.\n\"I got a phone call from a lady at the scene and all she said was that James had been in a wreck,\" Samantha said. \"I hung up the phone and ran out the door and I was there in like two minutes.\"\nJames says he doesn't remember much about the crash.\n\"I don't remember like the first ten seconds before the wreck happened,\" he said. \"Except for me seeing grass out the windshield.\"\nNeighbor Vickie Yates heard the crash. She called 911 and also ran to see if she could help the driver.\nWEDDING PHOTOS: Click here to see photos from the wedding\n“He just told me his name was James, he’s supposed to be getting married tomorrow, he didn’t remember what happened and he was pretty hurt so I just tried to keep him talking until help got here,\" Yates said.\nThat's when Samantha arrived at the scene of the accident.\n\"When I got to the scene he was laying on the ground and the car was just horrible. They wouldn't let me near him and I just wanted to be near him,\" Samantha said. \"He’s excellent, he’s my true love, we’ve been together for six years.\"\n\"I really didn't think we were gonna be able to get married the next day,\" she admitted. \"I was more worried about him being okay.\"\nShe says when the doctor came in to see the pair, they learned his X-rays and CT scans were fine and he only had a concussion. They left the hospital and went home around midnight.\n\"I think it made [the wedding] more special,\" Samantha said. \"Because we could have just as easily been at a funeral.\"\nOfficials have not said exactly what caused the accident.\nPREVIOUS ARTICLE:\nHusband-to-be seriously injured in Rowan Co. crash Copyright 2015 WBTV.
