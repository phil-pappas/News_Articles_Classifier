But the home team recovered emphatically after the break with 29 unanswered points. \nFreshman Ben Nix returned a punt 45 yards for a touchdown and Kyle Hartzell scored on a fumble recovery to give Stuttgart some needed special-teams and defensive points. The Panther offense did its part, too, as Myles Bryant ran for 191 yards and two touchdowns, Nick Abel collected 97 rushing yards and a touchdown and Harrison Lane found Jamie Ensley for a 22-yard touchdown pass. \nEnsley added two interceptions on defense, while Kevin Wentland had three sacks and Kevin Collins added an interception and four tackles. \nStuttgart returns to the win column after taking its first loss of the season, a 13-6 decision to defending champion Ramstein, last Saturday. The Panthers are 2-1 in divisional play entering their visit to Lakenheath next weekend. Kaiserslautern will travel to Vilseck in search of its first win of the fall.
