Hawthorne Blvd . has been vacant since July, squatters moved in soon after. The 2,664 square-foot home was built in 1909 and sold in July for $900,000, according to Multnomah County property records.\nThe unidentified man — wearing a green scarf around his head, brown shirt and khaki-colored pants — has been on the roof all afternoon, neighbors said. He appeared to have tied rope or cables attached to a nearby tree to himself and sat silently atop the white two-story home. The remains of the front porch laid in a heap of wood and other debris in the front yard.\nCaution tape stretched from the east side of the house to the corner of Southeast 34th Avenue. As of about 6 p.m., workers appeared ready to erect a fence around the home. At least a dozen officers were observing the crowd of about 60 spectators of all ages.\nMany of the people calmly gathered seemed amused by the event, which took on a circus-like atmosphere, and they recorded it with cellphone pictures and videos. One man wearing a bike helmet and sunglasses serenaded the crowd by playing a saxophone. He was balancing on rollerblades as he played in front of a Cha! Cha! Cha! taqueria restaurant. Another man with a Jimi Hendrix shirt later joined him and played an acoustic guitar.\nAt one point, a Pygmy/Lamancha goat named \"Deer\" stood on top of a white minivan on the south side of Hawthorne, directly across the street from the man on the roof. The animal remained there for at least a half hour before being taken down by its owner.\nTraffic continued to move slowly along Hawthorne with some drivers honking in apparent support as they passed.\nPortland police say the trio arrested are accused of disorderly conduct. Any identities or potential charges have not been released.\nThere are no plans to remove or force the protester from the roof, police on the scene said. The property developer was making arrangements to bring in private security to relieve officers at the home, according to police.\nNeighbor Andrew Waltz said he spotted the man on top of the house about 12:30 p.m. and posted it to Facebook. He said he felt the city has been \"too lax\" in allowing developers to tear down homes to build other structures, but also added that he was not sympathetic to the squatters who had taken over the home.\n\"These are out-of-towners who care very little about the integrity of the neighborhood,\" said Waltz, 31. \"They just want to keep their squat spot.\"\nNetty Haze, a manager of nearby business Jambo World Crafts, said she felt that the future of what to do with the home should rest with the property owner.\n\"It's unfortunate when a home is torn down and there aren't any options for the property,\" she said.\nTwo people who identified themselves as squatters in the home said they believed the man on the roof, another squatter, had a giant jug of coffee and enough food and supplies to stay atop the home for two weeks.\nThe duo said they were part of a group of 10 people who lived off and and on in the home's four apartments for about a month. They described the man on the roof as an artist and a free climber.\nOne of the squatters, who identified himself only as Stefan, said they all hope the home is turned into a community center with a kitchen to feed the homeless and public showers. He acknowledged their desires for the home do not weigh heavily because they don't own the residence.\n\"But if we could get enough people behind it, we could get funding,\" he said.\n-- George Rede\ngrede@oregonian.com\n503-294-4004; @georgerede", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@georgerede", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/3423+SE+Hawthorne+Blvd,+Portland,+OR+97214/@45.5123264,-122.6312159,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x5495a091f66bd5ef:0xbd43902ead1346ca"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:16:26.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
