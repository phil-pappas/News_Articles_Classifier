Bopanna and Isner had three breakpoint opportunities in the match but all were wasted.\nAlso, three double faults by the losing pair did not help matters as Cuevas and Troicki sailed into the quarterfinals.\nLeander Paes, with Australia's John Peers, had too lost his opener on Tuesday when the pair went down to Canadian-French fourth seeds Daniel Nestor and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-7(1), 6-4, 9-11.
