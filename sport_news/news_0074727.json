It was also unintentionally hilarious. \nFor starters, never in a million years did ESPN's Mike Tirico envision his television career would include emcee for a science-fiction movie trailer. But there was Tirico, good company hype-man, reading his lines with a straight face. John Gruden, Tirico's Monday Night Football broadcast partner, probably wanted no part of the Star Wars hype and jumped to hyperspace out of the booth. \nThen there's Chris Berman, who I'm sure told ESPN executives no way in hell would he take a back seat to light sabers and X-Wings. The man is an institution in Bristol and he was going to get his dated NFL highlights in for the umpteenth time, darn it, and make those Star Wars nerds wait for their moment of glory. \nAnd finally, sometime around 10:15 p.m., Disney gave the people what they wanted. \nThe hype worked, as Monday Night Football had a ratings spike before the Star Wars trailer debuted. #MNF viewership actually peaked *before* #StarWars trailer at 10:10pm: peak was 9:45-10pm, 11.7 rating in metered mkts, which is above avg. — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) October 20, 2015 \nOn social media, searches for \"football\" and \"Star Wars\" revealed amusing results. Folks who had no interest in sports sat through a terrible first half between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. Football fans who didn't care about Star Wars suffered through all the promos and forced movie references. Meanwhile, a subsection of fans who enjoy both sports and Star Wars went all in with the jokes. \"Aren’t you a little short for a quarterback …?” #StarWarsMNF pic.twitter.com/7Dew9YBeGg — Owen Good (@owengood) October 20, 2015 At least Star Wars fans are prepared for the terrible dialogue that is Chris Berman speaking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:55:19.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
