Getting goals from Casper Duell, IJ Woodby and Chris Brown along with a pair of assists from Carter Phillips, the Bulldogs downed Croatan 3-1 on Wednesday night to claim their first East Central 2-A Conference title and first league crown overall since 2009. The Bulldogs (16-4) are now 8-1 and close out their ECC schedule Tuesday when they play host to North Brunswick (11-6-2), which is 5-2-1 – including a 2-1 loss to Dixon in Leland a week ago. Even if the Scorpions were to win out and Dixon lose, the Bulldogs would claim the title by a 1/2 game because of North Brunswick’s tie at Croatan on Sept. 21. “We’ve been close for the last five or so years and we finally did enough to win it,” coach Kevin Hicks said. “It’s a good feeling to get back to that place in our program where we won the conference. It’s a good feeling for the boys, it’s good for the school, the program, the parents – everybody. We’re excited about it.” With the score tied 1-1, Woody, who also had an assist, scored late in the opening half to give the Bulldogs a 2-1 lead at intermission. Brown scored late in the second half for the final margin. “Best thing about tonight was we found a way to win,” Hicks said. “It wasn’t our best performance, but this group of kids are really mentally tough. We weren’t possessing the ball quite as well as we normally do. But that being said, we found a way to score three goals.” Dixon 2 1 – 3 Croatan 1 0 – 1 GOALS –D: Duell, I. Woodby, Brown. C: Dupree.

Southwest 3, Northside 1: Senior Noah Tausch returned on senior night after missing much of the season because of a broken wrist and turned in a night to remember, scoring two goals and also assisting on a goal by Wade Runyon as Southwest downed Northside in an East Central 2-A Conference match. Tausch injured his wrist in a 3-2 loss at North Brunswick on Sept. 23 and had not played since. Over that span, the Stallions were 0-7 and were outscored 29-2, but his return helped spur the Stallions to victory on a night when he and fellow senior Shawn Workman were honored. Page 2 of 2 - “It would have been nice to have him earlier, but better late than never,” SWO first-year coach Derick Jenkins said. “We’ve just been so hurt it’s been hard to put anything together.” The win left Southwest at 5-12-1 and 2-7 in the ECC.
