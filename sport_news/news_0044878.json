Aziz also hinted on sharing with the US dossiers on India's alleged involvement in \"subversive\" activities, saying that documents shared with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon would also be shared with \"other friendly countries\".\nHe accused India's state institutions, including the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), of allegedly supporting militants to destabilise Pakistan. India has always rejected such allegations made by Pakistan. Aziz also rejected New Delhi's assertion that Pakistan was supporting non-state actors in India.\nTalking about border skirmishes, Aziz said that the rising tension between Pakistan and India was a threat to world peace. Talking about the suspension of the Samjhuta Express, Aziz said Pakistan has asked the Indian High Commission to extend the visa for those who were scheduled to travel to India by the train. The train service has been suspended since Thursday due to farmers protest on the Indian side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:14:35.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
