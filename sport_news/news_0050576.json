The suspected gang-related killing remains unsolved.\n\"Some dudes are just out there doing what they do, but when somebody is actually trying to turn it around and taking the right steps, this just hits like a double whammy,'' said Joe McFerrin II, chief executive officer of Portland Opportunities Industrialization Center Inc. (POIC), which runs Rosemary Anderson High School, an alternative school in North Portland.\nAbout a year ago, Matthews pleaded with McFerrin and others who run Rosemary Anderson High School for the chance to study there so he could obtain his high school equivalency diploma even though he essentially had \"aged out.''\n\"He was really jet set on getting his high school diploma,'' McFerrin said. \"You know, I've heard others say that before, but he was very persistent on really, really wanting to come and work towards it.''\nRosemary Anderson allowed Matthews to study at the school, but set conditions: He had to maintain good attendance, conduct himself properly on school grounds and serve as a good role model to other students.\nHe needed a handful of credits and spent a year in classes, graduating this past June, McFerrin said.\n\"He met all the requirements,'' McFerrin recalled. He said Matthews also tried to caution other youth not to follow his path in the criminal justice system.\n\"He was able to share his negative experiences, telling kids you don't want to do like what I did – how that lifestyle is not really all that it's cracked up to be,'' McFerrin said. \"It was promising because of his attitude.''\nMatthews' father, 40-year-old Dion Anthony Matthews was killed in a drug-related stabbing in July 2012.\n The 23-year-old Matthews was on parole stemming from a 2009 robbery conviction. He also faced a new federal indictment in January, accused of felon in possession of a firearm. He was accused of carrying a 9mm handgun in Portland on Oct. 11, 2014. He was released from custody in January, pending a November trial, with the conditions that he have no contact with known gang members and submit to alcohol and drug testing.\nJulia Mitchell, a center program coordinator, said of Matthews, \"We all had a relationship with him. He was a young dad...After he graduated, he came back weekly. He got a job. He was talking about wanting to go to college.''\nCentral Precinct Capt. Tom Hunt said Matthews had been attending an event downtown Sunday night and appeared to have been \"minding his own business.'' Homicide detectives are continuing to investigate the shooting. No arrest has been made.\nGang outreach worker and ex-gang member Deandre \"Choo\" Fair said Matthews was his nephew. He said Matthews had checked in with his parole officer four days before his death. He said Matthews was in the \"wrong place at the wrong time'' Sunday night.\n\"I just hope and pray that someone steps up'' to identify \"a coward who took his life,'' Fair said.\nThe homicide was one of 12 gang-related violence calls Portland police responded to in the last two weeks.\n\"Twelve new cases in the last two weeks – which is about 12 cases too many,'' North Precinct Capt. Chris Davis said.\nThere were 11 shootings and one stabbing, driving the number of gang violence calls to 158 so far this year, the busiest year of gang violence since 1998, when police started tracking such cases.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:40:11.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
