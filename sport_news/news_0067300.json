Comment By Darrell Richardson/The Oak Ridger   Darrell Richardson/The Oak Ridger Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 10:37 PM By Darrell Richardson/The Oak Ridger Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 10:37 PM BLANKENSHIP FIELD — With only two games left in the regular season, Oak Ridge hosted the first against Knoxville Webb (now 4-4 overall) on Friday … taking advantage of the Spartans' multiple fumbles and ultimately outscoring their non-district rival 62-6 in near-perfect play on a picture-perfect night for football. Three different Wildcats scored Oak Ridge's first three touchdowns, while six different players in all would eventually cross the goal line for the 'Cats. Scoring three times for the home team was UT verbal commit Tee Higgins, whose patience and game-sense was rewarded by yet another night of making the difficult catches look SO easy from the end zone. Oak Ridge sophomore Johnny Stewart scored two of the Wildcats' nine touchdowns Friday night, as well. \"We may have squandered some early opportunities,\" coach Joe Gaddis said following the win. \"But after that we clicked offensively and defensively; and I thought we had a good overall effort.\" Regarding the visiting Spartans, Gaddis said, \"This team is much better than the final score indicates.\" In particular, 6-5, 240 Webb senior Andrew Craig looked like he might give Oak Ridge some trouble early on in the game but the Wildcats persevered as they lifted their overall record to 8-1. They now prepare to host fellow Region 3-5A foe Campbell County (5-4, 3-1 district) at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 30 in the final game of the regular season — which will once again be held at Blankenship Field. Gaddis told his team and fans on the field immediately after Friday's victory over Webb that whomever wins the Campbell County vs. Oak Ridge matchup will have home-field advantage going into the playoffs. \"The winner of next week's game (Oct. 30) will play at home,\" coach Gaddis said. \"And there's no better place than this place here!\" Darrell Richardson can be contacted at (865) 220-5510.
