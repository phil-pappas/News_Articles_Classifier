Richard Hoyda of the Hammond police. The man told her she was going to get into his black sedan; when she refused, she told officers he said, \"Don't make me do this,\" and showed her what looked like a gun handle.\nThe woman also pulled out what looked like a gun to the victim and forced her in the front seat of the car, Hoyda said.\nThe two suspects took the woman to several Chicago ATMs and forced her to withdraw money, but when her card wouldn't work, they took her to Hammond, Hoyda said. When her card still wouldn't work, they left the woman in the 5600 block of Calumet Avenue about 12:50 a.m. Friday, he said.\nThe victim said she was unharmed in the incident, and the two didn't get any money from her, Hoyda said. They did, however, take an Apple iPad, credit cards and an iPhone.\nThe victim's husband picked her up Friday morning from the Hammond Police Station, and the detective assigned to the case is trying to re-establish contact with her. She described her kidnappers as \"young\" but wasn't sure they were teens, a police press release said.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Detective Sgt. John Suarez at 219-852-2981.\nMichelle L.
