The Pittsburgh Steelers defensive end released a statement late Tuesday that he met with NFL officials after the league fined him for writing \"Iron\" and \"Head\" on the black under each eye in consecutive weeks.\nFormer Passaic High School star Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward played 11 seasons in the NFL after a standout career at Pitt. He died of cancer in 2006.\nCam Heyward says he was simply trying to pay tribute to his father and others affected by cancer. He writes that he had a \"respectful\" exchange with the league and doesn’t want to be a distraction to his team.\nHeyward will wear plain eye black going forward and has started an initiative with EyeBlack.com to help provide money for cancer research.\nMARIOTA SITS: Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota did not practice Wednesday, giving the sprained MCL in his left knee a day of rest. The rookie was not wearing any protective gear on his injured leg as he talked about playing Sunday.\nMariota said he would wear a brace if he must. He also said his chances of playing against the Atlanta Falcons are pretty good, and he’s keeping up with treatment and preparing as if he’ll start his sixth NFL game.\n\"You’ve got to be able to show that you buy into what’s going on here, and I’m going to do my best to make sure that I’m prepared and hopefully can go on Sunday,\" Mariota said.\nMariota sprained the ligament when he was hit low by Dolphins DE Olivier Vernon in last week’s 38-10 loss to Miami, and Vernon said Wednesday the NFL fined him for the hit. It’s the same knee Mariota sprained in 2013 at Oregon, and he played the final four games that season wearing a brace.\n’SKINS’ INJURIES: Redskins left tackle Trent Williams and tight end Jordan Reed have returned to limited practice as they go through the NFL’s concussion protocol.\nCoach Jay Gruden says neither player has been cleared for contact, and both will visit an independent neurologist later in the week.\nGruden also expects wide receiver DeSean Jackson to be out for Washington’s game against Tampa Bay on Sunday, calling a quicker return from his hamstring injury \"a long shot.\"\nJACKSON IN CRASH: Seahawks running back Fred Jackson will play tonight against San Francisco after being examined by the team following a minor car crash.\nJackson participated in the team’s walkthrough practice before departing to face the 49ers. It’s the second car accident the Seahawks are dealing with after fullback Derrick Coleman was involved in a two-car crash last week that led to his arrest for investigation involving charges of vehicular assault and hit-and-run.\nJackson’s accident happened Tuesday night near the team’s facility. The Renton Police Department said that shortly before 5 p.m., Jackson lost control of his 2016 Chevrolet Corvette as he drove down Seahawks Way. A stop sign and street signs were knocked over in the wreck. Jackson’s vehicle sustained moderate front-end damage.\nCarroll said Jackson was ticketed and he’s confident no other players were involved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:01:11.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
