Torrey Mitchell added a goal for Montreal in the third period. \nMontreal improved to 3-0-0, while Ottawa dropped to 2-1-0. \nMatt O'Connor made 31 saves for Ottawa in his NHL debut. \nPlekanec opened the scoring at 9:41 of, beating O'Connor with a sharp angle shot. Plekanec added his third the season with 1:26 left, breaking in alone and beat O'Connor through the legs. \nPageau pulled Ottawa with one in a 2-one-1 break with Curtis Lazar. \nMitchell redirected P.K. Subban's shot from just inside the blue line at 5:41 of the third, leaving O'Connor with little chance. \nNotes: Senators owner Eugene Melnyk took part in a ceremonial opening faceoff with his two daughters. He had a liver transplant this year. ... Condon and O'Connor are the first goalies to make their first NHL starts in the same game since Oct. 14, 1967. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:33:49.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
