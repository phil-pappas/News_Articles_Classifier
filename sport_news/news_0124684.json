He wasn’t allowed to make appearances on it during his time at ESPN , so this afternoon’s appearance was pretty historic. And both Simmons and Francesa dropped some bombshells during the show that made it well worth the wait for listeners.\nSimmons revealed that he thinks the NFL got him fired from ESPN . Francesa talked about how he has agreed to take part in a 30 For 30 that’s being created about the Mike and the Mad Dog radio show. The two also discussed how Francesa tried to convince Simmons to be his new radio co-host after Chris “Mad Dog” Russo left in 2008. And at one point, Simmons also told Francesa that he found out ESPN was firing him on Twitter, which is something that some people speculated about back when ESPN did the deed.\n“It was abrupt,” he said. “I found out on Twitter. That’s probably not how you want to find out after 14 years.”\nYou can listen to the entire interview here:\n .", "external_links": ["https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/228420027&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true", "http://deadspin.com/espners-bill-simmons-found-out-he-was-fired-on-twitter-1703112625"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:22:37.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
