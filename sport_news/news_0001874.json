Television reporters have a difficult job to do. Not only do they have to come up with compelling questions during live interviews, but they also have to deal with players, coaches and fans trying to sabotage the broadcast in the form of a snarky answer, dirty look or videobomb.\nAdChoices One unlucky FOX Sports reporter had all those things in check during a recent broadcast, but something that was completely out of his control abruptly ended his report.\nDavid Medrano Mora was on scene outside Mexico’s Guadalajara International Airport to recap a match between Chivas and Club America that had recently ended and was being introduced by studio anchor Aldo Sanchez. But before Sanchez could finish talking, Mora was hit by a car.\nAs you can see, Mora looked over his shoulder roughly one second before he was struck but had no time to get out of the way. Luckily, Mora did not suffer any many injuries from the incident, according to Sam Matthew of the Daily Mail.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeUQRP.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkIUP&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Lea", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyIp2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Lea", "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeH1Rm.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyIp2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Trevor", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jason", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.yardbarker.com/rss/msn_prime/12740&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeWcRq.img&quot;}}", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3253719/Mexican-sports-reporter-hit-car-live-broadcast-airport.html", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeSvco.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Jason", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;soccer&quot;},&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&quot;FWNetworkId&quot;:188286,&quot;FWServer&quot;:&quot;http://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitTimeout", "http://www.yardbarker.com/soccer/articles/sports_reporter_gets_hit_by_car_during_live_broadcast_video/s1_12740_19631788&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB47wtI.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Shocking", "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:37:56.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
