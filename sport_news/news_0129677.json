Since Aug. 1, voters in the Baker County town have recalled their mayor and one city councilor. A second councilor, who would have been the subject of a recall election, resigned because she was moving outside the city limits and would no longer be eligible to serve. To fill those vacancies, the remaining Sumpter councilors voted to appoint Leland Myers to replace Melissa Findley as mayor. Councilors also appointed Samantha Esposito to replace LeAnne Woolf, who was recalled by a vote of 45-44 earlier this month. Woolf is Myers’ daughter. Councilors appointed Cary Clarke, a former Sumpter Planning Commission member, to replace Toni Thompson, the councilor who resigned after moving outside the city limits. Both Clarke and Esposito will serve terms that continue through the end of 2016. Myers, who has lived in Sumpter since 1963, has considerable experience as a city councilor, having served in that position for 19 years starting in the 1970s. Myers himself was recalled from office in October 1995, two months after a group of residents asked him to resign and accused him of “trying to run the town.” A month later a Baker County grand jury indicted Myers on one count of second-degree theft and one count of third-degree theft, both misdemeanors. Myers was accused of receiving just under $300 from the city for writing ordinances. Greg Baxter, district attorney at the time, argued that Myers was doing that work as a volunteer councilor and was not supposed to bill the city for his time. In May 1997, Circuit Court Judge Milo Pope dismissed the theft charges against Myers, saying there was no basis for prosecuting Myers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:22:38.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
