Video provided by Newsy Newslook CC Sabathia was 6-10 with a 4.73 ERA this season.

I want to take control of my disease, and I want to be a better man, father and player.\" \nSabathia's departure leaves Ivan Nova as the lone Yankee starter with playoff experience - Nova started one game in the 2011 Division Series against Detroit. While 2015 was not Sabathia's finest season - he finished 6-10 with a 4.73 ERA - he did pitch 167 innings after injuries limited him to just eight starts and 46 innings in 2014. \n\"What CC is dealing with is a life issue,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Monday. \"It's bigger than the game tomorrow. (Getting help) is the most important thing right now.\" \nSabathia etched himself into Yankees lore with his gutsy performance in the 2009 playoffs, winning three of his four starts - all on three days' rest - and earning AL Championship Series MVP honors. The Yankees won the World Series in the first year of his seven-year, $161 million contract. \nThis year, any postseason heroics will be shelved as Sabathia battles a formidable off-field foe. \n“I want to thank the New York Yankees organization for their encouragement and understanding,\" he said. \"Their support gives me great strength and has allowed me to move forward with this decision with a clear mind. \n“As difficult as this decision is to share publicly, I don’t want to run and hide. But for now please respect my family’s need for privacy as we work through this challenge together. \n“Being an adult means being accountable. Being a baseball player means that others look up to you. I want my kids — and others who may have become fans of mine over the years — to know that I am not too big of a man to ask for help. I want to hold my head up high, have a full heart and be the type of person again that I can be proud of. And that’s exactly what I am going to do. \n“I am looking forward to being out on the field with my team next season playing the game that brings me so much happiness.” \nSabathia has long been regarded as one of the game's great competitors, a reputation first developed in leading small-market clubs in Cleveland and Milwaukee to playoff berths. And his off-the-field contributions have been well-documented: In 2011 and 2014, he was the Yankees' nominee for Major League Baseball's Roberto Clemente Award, given to the player who best represents the game on the field and in community involvement, and has received multiple honors from the Yankees and area media for his community involvement in New York and New Jersey. \nIn the past year, Sabathia found himself explaining a trio of off-field situations. In December 2014, police were summoned at Newark Airport when Sabathia grew irate after he and a traveling party were denied boarding a flight to Jamaica after they arrived late to the terminal. He and his party eventually boarded a later flight. \nIn August, a video obtained and released by TMZ showed Sabathia outside a Toronto nightclub yelling at another party before he's eventually led into a taxi cab by friends attempting to restrain him. \nSabathia acknowledged the incident and, when asked by reporters how he would explain it to his 12-year-old son, said: \"'Dad had a bad night, made a bad decision. Sometimes these things happen.'\" \nHe and his wife Amber also were subjected to a private party claiming to have pictures of Sabathia smoking a joint on an Atlanta hotel balcony. Perhaps to get ahead of the situation, Sabathia posted photos to his Instagram account - later deleted - featuring the hashtags #ItsOnlyACigar and #MiniCigarillos. \nCashman said Sabathia \"demonstrated a great deal of courage\" in seeking help now, and said Sabathia has been a tremendous person and leader with the Yankees. \n\"CC is loved,\" Cashman said. \nSabathia is under contract with the Yankees through next season, at $25 million, along with a $25 million option in 2017 that will vest should he avoid shoulder injuries next season. \nContributing: Joe Lemire in New York \nGALLERY: CC SABATHIA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:24:27.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
