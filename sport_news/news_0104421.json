Here's how the Sooners did against Kansas State: \nOffense: A MANHATTAN, Kan. — Dede Westbrook hauls in a touchdown reception on Oct. 17, 2015. Westbrook had a team-high five receptions and 85 receiving yards. Joe Buettner/The Daily \nOklahoma’s offense was outstanding on Saturday, responsible for 48 of OU’s 55 points against Kansas State. Lincoln Riley said after the game his team found a spark during the week leading up to the game and “made a lot of progress.” If that’s the case, it showed in Manhattan. Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon combined for 31 touches and Baker Mayfield’s five first-half touchdowns tied a school record. There’s very little to complain about offensively, but it wasn’t all perfect… \nOffensive line: C MANHATTAN, Kansas — Redshirt freshman Orlando Brown tries to provide protection on Oct. 17, 2015. OU's line held up in a 55-0 win for the Sooners. Joe Buettner/The Daily \nOU’s offensive line continues to be a problem. It didn’t hold the Sooners back too much against Kansas State thanks to play-calling adjustments made by Riley, but it’s still an obvious weak spot for teams to exploit. Jonathan Alvarez and Ty Darlington continue to be a liability next to each other, and the unit as a whole isn’t cohesive. That hurt OU to the tune of three sacks and an average third down distance of 9.4 yards in the first half. Better teams will take advantage of the Sooners’ porous offensive line if they don’t figure it out soon. \nDefense: A+ MANHATTAN, Kansas — Dominique Alexander tries to hurry Joe Hubener on Oct. 17, 2015. Alexander and the OU defense shut out Kansas State, 55-0. Joe Buettner/The Daily \nOklahoma’s defense was dominant, regardless of how many quarterbacks Kansas State has already gone through this season. The Wildcats managed just 110 total yards and seven first downs. The Sooners also grabbed three interceptions and took one back for a defensive score. It was a great redemption game for Mike Stoops and his defense after giving up more than 300 yards on the ground a week ago. \nReadiness: A MANHATTAN, Kansas — Redshirt freshman Joe Mixon celebrates with Jarvis Baxter on Oct. 17, 2015. The running back finished with two total touchdowns in OU's 55-point win. Joe Buettner/The Daily \nOklahoma coaches and players received criticism for “not being ready to play” against Texas last weekend, but those issues appeared to be remedied against Kansas State. Mayfield tossed a pair of touchdowns in the first quarter and Oklahoma’s opening drive needed just five plays before the Sooners found the end zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:07:17.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
