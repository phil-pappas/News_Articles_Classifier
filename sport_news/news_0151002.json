The Mumbai youngster had done the hard yards, stroking a wonderful 86 (163b, 12x4, 1x6) in a high-pressure situation before suffering a terrible case of 'brain freeze,' which left him as the villain, rather than the hero of his team. With 15 runs left for the target on the final day of this exciting encounter between Mumbai and Andhra at the Dr PVG Raju Spots Complex here, Lad pulled a short ball from Bandaru Ayyappa straight down deep square leg's throat.\nA similarly silly stroke, off another short ball from the seamer, then quickly saw Shardul Thakur make his exit, and within no time, Mumbai had folded up for 237, losing their last five wickets for 43 runs to concede the first innings lead to Andhra for the first time-ever, despite being just seven runs short of the opponents' total. Hugging Kaif tightly, the 22-year-old Ayyappa, whose father used to iron clothes for a living, celebrated wildly as he finished with career-best figures of six for 71.\nIn a case of deja vu for the Ranji giants, it followed a similarly poor start to their campaign in the previous season when they lost to Jammu & Kashmir in the opener. Considering the rich history of the 40-time Ranji champs, this outing is surely another low among a few they've slipped to in recent seasons. The dogged determination to hang in till the job is done -a typical Mumbai batsman's trait in the past, now seems to be a relic in this T20 age.\nCounting Akhil Herdwakar's dismissal in, three of Mumbai's batsmen had fallen prey to the `short ball' trap -a master plan devised by Andhra skipper Mohammad Kaif, which worked out beautifully .In short, Mumbai's batting had suffered a `short circuit.' To rub salt into the visitors' wounds later, Andhra opener KS Bharat then hooked three sixes off short deliveries which Mumbai's pacers tried to bowl to him in vain, showing them exactly how the shot should be executed.\nDescribing his tactic later, Kaif said: \"My most experienced seamer (Vijaykumar) was injured, and two other bowlers had niggles. However, I took the risk of asking Ayyappa to bowl short because I knew that he can bowl a good bouncer. I didn't want to play the waiting game. I wanted to be aggressive, and luckily for me, it paid off. Those same shots could've gone for sixes too, but this is the way I want my team to play its cricket.\nMy experience of having faced similar situations helped too. \"The veteran player summed up the difference between the two teams brilliantly. A few close wins in the previous season (in a lower division) have given us self-belief, which you saw out there today. I knew they were unsure about themselves from the moment they chose to field, and not bat first. They have a young, inexperienced team which could've cracked under pressure and it did. Since we too had a young team, I knew whoever handled pressure better would win,\" he said.\nWith the clash against a strong Punjab slated to begin on October 8, Mumbai would need to quickly put this disappointment behind, which won't be easy. It was baffling to see Mumbai play such senseless cricket on Sunday despite the presence of an astute brain in coach Chandrakant Pandit in their dressing room. Andhra, meanwhile, can raise a toast to their historic achievement tonight. Led by a courageous captain with a wealth of knowledge about the game, they've shown they can stand up to the big boys of Indian cricket. And teach them a thing or two too!\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:02:38.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
