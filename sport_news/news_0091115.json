But I think that you transform when you cross the white line, you're not the same person as off it. I give no quarter and I ask for none. Out there I'm going to fight for my team and do the best I can,\" Costa was quoted as saying by the BBC.\n\"Afterwards, when the match is over, I have my family and my friends. I have fun like a normal person.
