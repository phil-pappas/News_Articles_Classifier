This year’s 1.5 mile race started and finished in the back parking lot of the Courtyard King Kamehameha’s Kona Beach Hotel, with a turnaround at Uncle Billy’s \nThe Underpants Run was first concieved in 1998 by Chris Danahy, Tim Morris and Paul Huddle as a protest against wearing Speedoes in inappropriate places such as stores and restaurants. Over the year, the race has morphed into an IRONMAN pre-race event and local fundraiser. The Underpants Run has raised over $240,000 for local charities, not including this year.
