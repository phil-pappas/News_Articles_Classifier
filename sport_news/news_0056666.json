Then they wound up with nothing, when new kicker Caleb Sturgis missed a 33-yard field goal to end their latest scoreless first half.\nAnother glaring sequence also involved Agholor. On the next snap after the rookie hauled in a 45-yard catch in the second quarter, the Eagles called for a reverse. It backfired. Agholor fumbled the exchange from Ryan Mathews.\nWashington recovered.\nThe Eagles, though, will be hard-pressed to recover from this early-season funk.\nSure, there’s time. It’s a long season, and the NFC South was won last year by a team that couldn’t even produce a winning record.\nBut the Eagles look anything like a team to be trusted.\nAfter Sunday’s debacle, Kelly, the coach who should question the essential general manager (himself) for the fallout from his questionable offseason moves, lamented the execution (again).\nDeMarco Murray, meanwhile, lamented his lack of touches.\nMurray - who was lured from Dallas with a five-year, $42 million contract, but didn’t start after missing the previous week’s victory at the New York Jets because of a hamstring injury - ripped off a 30-yard run on his first carry.\nHe gained 6 yards on his other 7 rushes in the game.\nFast fact: The Eagles are 0-3 in games with Murray this season, 1-0 in games without him.\nKelly’s creative offense? My, how it fizzles. So much for revolutionizing the NFL.\nNow Kelly’s offense specializes in three-and-outs.\nIn 16 quarters this season, the Eagles have laid goose eggs in half of them. Until Sam Bradford hit Riley Cooper for a 62-yard touchdown early in the third quarter on Sunday, the Eagles had gone four quarters, dating to the previous week against the Jets, without scoring a single point.\nFour quarters, as in a single game.\nHey, the blocking was spotty again, as Washington’s defensive line sacked Sam Bradford five times and hit him at least eight other times. He was sacked on back-to-back plays to pretty much sum up the last desperate drive in the final half-minute.\nThen there are the injuries. They keep piling up. All-pro left tackle Jason Peters left with a quad injury and right tackle Lane Johnson suffered a knee sprain, casting doubt on their effectiveness in the near future, if not their immediate availability. The defense was undermanned on Sunday when cornerback Byron Maxwell (quadriceps) and linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) went down with injuries on the first drive. Then defensive end Brandon Bair was knocked out of the game, too, with a groin injury. And it’s still uncertain when big offseason acquisition Kiko Alonso (knee) will return to his inside linebacker post.\nTough times for a team that can’t get out of its own way.\nBut at least there’s plenty of blame to go around – which must be some other type of law.\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf1acK.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAyrb0&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Jeremy", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf6uxc.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAct2Jp&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;DeMarco", "http://vamp.csprt-origin.com/msn-sports-video/raw_rss.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf79Bu.img&quot;}}", "http://www.twitter.com/JarrettBell", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf6TYr.img&quot;}}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:41:50.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
