San Diego dropped to 2-3. \nVick, having an awful game until the fourth quarter, kept the drive alive with a 24-yard scramble up the middle and then a 16-yard pass to Heath Miller one play before Bell’s big run. \nSan Diego rookie Josh Lambo kicked a go-ahead, 54-yard field goal with 2: 56 left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:51:01.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
