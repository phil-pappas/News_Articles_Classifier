The pair plan to close the shop and move to Grants Pass, Oregon. Jason Cowan / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Jamestown Hair Co. celebrated a decade in business Saturday, a bittersweet occasion as its owners make plans to close up shop and start fresh in Oregon. Hair stylists Jeannine Daniel and Holli Walser treated clients to discounted haircuts and snacks during the small anniversary party. It was an opportunity to thank patrons and recount memories. “I just love doing hair and being around people … hearing their stories,” Walser said. “A desk job just wasn’t in the works for me, that’s for sure.” Daniel purchased the shop in 2005 with her former husband and immediately brought Walser on board. The two had been cutting hair together in the Sonora area for close to 20 years already. In fact, it was Walser who first gave Daniel a job in the Mother Lode. “I’m from Northern California and Holli is from Southern California,” Daniel said. “We like to say we met in the middle.” When opened, Jamestown Hair Co. inherited a rich history at 18266 Smoke St. in Jamestown. Besides years of operating as a well-known salon prior to Daniel and Walser, the business once had a much seedier reputation. Once a brothel, the building is part of the historic Smoke Street red-light district. An engraved stone plaque — donated by the Native Daughters of the Golden West — commemorates the site. Daniel also said the place could be haunted. Prior to Daniel’s purchase of the building, a client saw a ghost straightening up his shirt in the mirror and one standing on the porch. “I haven’t had any heebie-jeebies, although in pictures sometimes orbs do show up,” Daniel said. The shop has also made headlines since Daniel and Walser moved in. The Union Democrat reported on two unlikely pastel-colored roosters roaming the salon’s gravel parking lot in 2005. The birds had been abandoned on Smoke Street and took to spending nights on the shop’s front porch after Daniel and Walser started feeding them. In a shop full of dyes, it wasn’t long before the board stylists treated the birds to makeovers. The two still laugh about the “pets,” which vanished soon after, and worry PETA will come knocking on the door. The roosters are one of many memories the two can cling to as they brace themselves for a move to Grants Pass, Oregon, and new opportunities. After 30 years in the business, the move may hold a career change for the business partners as they talk of opening a plant nursery, vineyard or farm. The impetus for the move is to be closer to their sons, both of whom live up north. But the business partners are quick to point out their relationship, while extremely close, is nothing more. “We love men!” Walser said. “I swear.” “How we got so locked together … I don’t know,” Daniel said. The business is for sale but has only received a few inquires. In the meantime, Jamestown Hair Co. will remain open and run by Daniel and Walser for as long as possible. “We’re really encouraging clients to give whoever takes over a chance and support the new owners,” Daniel said. To which Walser added, “But we want the owners to keep the people we have coming here happy, because we do care about them. We do love them.” The shop now cuts hair for men and women, serving everyone from children to seniors, and provides haircuts, waxing, colors, perms, styling, roller sets, fades and beard trims. In addition to traditional appointments, house calls are made occasionally. “There’s a huge calling for it, but there’s not many hair dressers that are willing to do it,” Daniel said. Seniors and handicapped people with difficulty leaving home are among those who receive the special appointments. “With us selling the shop and moving, a lot of them are pretty upset about it. It’s hard,” Walser said. One client stopped by the shop Friday to just “socialize.” Katie Bostwick has been coming in for hair appointments for three years. On Friday, she sported scarlet braids, the latest coloring job done by Daniel. When asked what keeps her coming back, even when she’s not getting her hair done, Bostwick said, “Great atmosphere, great conversation, great hairstyling.” With the Jamestown Harley-Davidson shop located feet from the front door, bikes, specialty cars and music often flood over into the gravel parking lot off Main Street. “We’ve had some really good impromptu parties here,” Walser said. “We’ve always seemed to have really great people hanging around.” “The hardest thing about leaving will be the shop in general … it’s like a second home,” Walser said. Typical business hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays with special appointments accepted. Appointments can be made by calling 984-4122.
