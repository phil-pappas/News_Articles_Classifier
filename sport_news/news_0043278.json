His workload increased against Presbyterian because senior Darius Ramsey was out with a concussion, but Speir suggested Newsome's productivity demands that he get more carries. \n\"If Darius is healthy, we're going to use all three backs (including freshman Corey Holloway, with 145 rushing yards in three games), but Detrez is just running the ball extremely well,\" Speir said. \n\"He's a powerful runner, and he has shown some excellent speed with those long runs the last two games.\" \nNewsome is all for more carries and more emphasis on the ground game. \n\"When coach said we were going to run the ball more, I was all for that,\" he said with a laugh. \nA talented kick returner (285 yards, 21.9 yards per return), Newsome leads the SoCon in all-purpose yardage (195 per game) and teams with Mitchell (fifth in the league in total offense at 232 yards per game) to provide a solid 1-2 punch for the WCU offense. \n\"Troy had his best game against Presbyterian (14-of-24 passing, 226 yards and 75 yards rushing, including a game-clinching 36-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter), and I think it was because it was our best running game (316 yards rushing),\" said Speir. \n\"Troy was at ease and in the flow of the game, and that's when we can utilize him the best.\" \n\"Using the run to set up the pass really worked (vs. Presbyterian),\" said Newsome, who rushed for 488 yards and nine touchdowns last season as a freshman. \n\"Troy really played well and looked comfortable running that type of offense.\" \nThe Cats (2-2, 0-1) on Saturday begin a stretch of five straight SoCon games that will define their season, a 3:30 p.m. home game vs. Mercer (2-2, 0-1). \nDespite giving up 391 yards on the ground last week vs. Wofford in a 34-33 overtime loss, the Bears rank first in the SoCon in rushing defense, allowing an average of just 136 yards per game. \nThe Cats are fifth in the league in rushing offense at 216 yards per game. 2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1Lgj3yH TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:54:16.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
