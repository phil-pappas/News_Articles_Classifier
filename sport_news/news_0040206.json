The Classic will be run Saturday, Oct. 31, at Keeneland Race Track in Lexington, Ky.\nThere are four 3-year-olds in the Classic field, which will be run at 11/4 miles. They include American Pharoah, Travers winner Keen Ice, Pennsylvania Derby champ Frosted and European horse Gleneagles, who has won seven of 10 career starts (all on turf) and will be attempting to become the first foreign horse since Raven's Pass (2008) to win America's richest race.\n\"We are all on pins and needles,\" American Pharoah's trainer, Bob Baffert , said Wednesday. \"Our focus is on having him really ready.\"\nAmerican Pharoah had his eight-race winning streak snapped when he finished second in the Travers behind 16-1 shot Keen Ice. The Classic is Pharoah's last race before he starts his new career at Coolmore's Ashford Stud in Versailles, Ky.\nThis will be the first time American Pharoah will run against older horses, and he'll be facing the best that are in training. That includes the mare Beholder, who has won all five of her starts this year, including a win over the boys in the Pacific Classic.\nBeholder arrived in Kentucky on Monday and spiked a fever on Tuesday, which caused her to miss a day of training. Her trainer, Richard Mandella , said the 5-year-old was much better on Wednesday. He is still hoping Beholder will make the Classic. She won the 2012 Juvenile Fillies race and the 2013 Distaff. She was scratched from last year's Distaff because of a fever.\nBeholder was also pre-entered in the Distaff, which will be run on Friday, Oct. 30, but Mandella said the plan is for her to run in the Classic.\n\"I said all along that if I didn't think she was at the top of her game, I would go for the race (Distaff) written for her,\" Mandella said. \"My intention is to go to the Classic. If I had a feeling she was not up to par, I might be conservative and go the other way, but I don't see it. I think she is going to be fine.\"\nAlso entered in the Classic are New York-bred Effinex, who won the Grade II Suburban at Belmont and was fourth in the Woodward at Saratoga and third in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont; Hard Aces, who was sixth in a pair of Grade I's in California (Awesome Again and Pacific Classic); Whitney Handicap winner Honor Code; Awesome Again winner Smooth Roller; and Jockey Club Gold Cup winner Tonalist.\ntwilkin@timesunion.com • 518-454-5415 • @tjwilkin", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/62/8830124/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/62/8830124/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/62/8830124/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:34:56.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
