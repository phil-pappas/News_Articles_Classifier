That will never be forgotten.\" \nWales is preparing for a huge sporting weekend with both Welsh rugby and football teams in action on Saturday night. \nAnd the nation will be on a real high if Coleman's side pick up a point in Bosnia and the rugby team rubber-stamp their World Cup quarter-final place by beating Australia at Twickenham and winning their pool. \n\"We have been following all the rugby and it's a massive buzz to see them doing well too,\" Robson-Kanu said. \n\"It could be a great sporting day. Our focus will be fully on Bosnia and as soon as we kick-off we will be looking to get the result at the final whistle. \n\"But it's brilliant. You can really feel the buzz in the nation and in the city centre with the fans. \n\"There's a massive excitement and a feel-good factor but, for us as footballers, we're looking to really kick-start what could be a few special decades for Welsh football.\" \nRobson-Kanu has forged an effective strike partnership with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale as Wales have remained unbeaten in Euro qualification to top the Group B standings. \nAlthough he has only scored twice in his 28 international appearances, Robson-Kanu's pace and movement has occupied defenders and he has been an effective foil for talisman Bale. \nAnd the 26-year-old's contribution has not gone unnoticed as he has become the subject of a song heard throughout last month's Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel. \n\"It's some job getting a song for my name and credit to the Barry Horns band,\" said Robson-Kanu. \n\"It's a massive honour to have them singing my name like that. \n\"Being a national cult hero is special - but it's handy when you're playing next to Gareth Bale.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:39.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
