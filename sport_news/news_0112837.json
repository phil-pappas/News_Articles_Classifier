Lake County Forest Preserve District officials believe a \"few hundred\" common carp -- some weighing up to 15 pounds -- live in the lake. Carp are bottom-feeders that often uproot vegetation and disrupt the habitat of native fish, according to the National Park Service. related advertisement In an effort to reduce the numbers of the only nonnative species in the preserve's lake, the forest district will host an inaugural Carp-O-Rama from 6:30 a.m. to an hour before sunset Sunday, Oct. 18. Participants, who must fish from shore, can catch as many carp as they wish. Known as a battler, the fish may be kept presumably to eat or they can be turned over to the forest district for proper disposal. Independence Grove visitors center manager Sara Page said adults and children can have fun while helping restore the lake's ecosystem damaged by the carp. \"The carp are very big, so it is fun to catch a fish that you know is going to be big,\" Page said during a break Monday at Independence Grove's South Bay, where the tournament will be held. Forest district wildlife biologist Gary Glowacki said some of the carp in the lake are 15 years old. \"We have a lot of carp that are getting pretty old,\" Glowacki said. A few Independence Grove carp have been caught in recent years through electrofishing with assistance from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, he said. Under the method, electricity is used to stun the fish before they are scooped with a net. Older carp tend not to react to the electricity, Glowacki said, which is why forest district officials decided to stage Sunday's fishing derby. Predators also have not been a problem for the carp that likely entered the lake from floodwater from the nearby Des Plaines River. \"A pretty large carp doesn't have much to worry about,\" he said. Carp like sluggish water such as the Independence Grove lake, Glowacki said. Cash prizes will be awarded to anglers who catch the most common carp and for the largest, based on weight. It'll cost $10 to enter Sunday's Carp-O-Rama. Page said carp are the exception to the preserve's catch-and-release policy that applies to the native fish, including bass and blue gill. Despite its negative reputation, carp are considered fit for eating in some circles. For example, celebrity chef Cat Cora has a carp roe spread recipe on the Food Network website . There also is a pickled carp recipe offered on the National Park Service website . It involves cutting carp fillets into domino-sized pieces, placing them into canning jars and soaking overnight in a solution of equal parts of vinegar and water. \"We talked about putting a carp recipe in the registration packet that they (contestants) will get when they come that day, kind of entice people to take a little of their (catch) home,\" Page said. In 2012, Island Lake officials hosted a two-day Carp Fest. It was hoped the contest would help reduce the carp population in the village's namesake lake.
