That was important, we needed to get back to conceding zeroes or ones. \n“And away from that it has clicked and now we have a little break where we have to stay fit and try and return in the same form when we come back. \n“We can’t rest on our laurels and have to keep performing the way we are.” \nHenry scored a fine free-kick at Craven Cottage and should have notched his third of the season against the Terriers, but missed a close-range header from Dominic Iorfa’s cross.

But Henry said it wasn’t a matter that had an impact on the players, who since the announcement have registered successive wins.
