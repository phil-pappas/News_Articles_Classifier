With the latter, others can’t play through it and will only take the field if they’re 100 percent.\nTom Brady is not one of those players.\nSunday against the Cowboys, Brady could become the first quarterback in NFL history to make 100 straight regular-season starts twice in his career.\nIt’s an individual achievement that Brady views as a team one, too.\n“Well, I’m happy I’m available to my team,” Brady said. “I think that’s something I’ve always taken a lot of pride in, so trying to be out there and be a consistent, dependable player and certainly being available to those guys is what my job is.\n“It’s pretty fun. It’s great to go out there and play a lot of football, and I’ve been very fortunate to be protected so well by the offensive line. So a lot of good luck, it all helps.”\nThe only time his luck really ran out was in 2008, when a hit to his left knee against the Chiefs knocked him out for the season. Outside of that, though, Brady has suffered pain but played through it.\nLast year in particular he reportedly suffered an ankle injury. Although he’s made appearances on the injury report, unless he’s physically unable to perform, he’s out there, and that has an effect on the rest of his teammates.\n“We have a great deal of faith in Tom anyway,” running back Brandon Bolden said. “Him being able — whether hurt or not, healthy or not — to be able to go out there and perform at the level he does gives you a great deal of confidence not only in him and the team but in yourself. If you see him going out there and doing it, ‘Well, I can do it, too.’ So it’s kind of a collective thing to see him go out there and things like that.”\nBrady’s understudy, second-year signal-caller Jimmy Garoppolo, has watched Brady’s methods closely, but said the physical aspect isn’t always the most important part when it comes to staying on the field when playing through pain.\n“Really, just mind over matter,” Garoppolo said. “If you don’t think about it too much, it’s almost as if it’s not there. We’re all going to play through pain throughout the game and that’s just part of football. You just can’t think about it too much.”\nSaid Bolden: “You’ve got another 52 guys (on the active roster) depending on you. Just that thought alone makes you forget about yourself and put the team first.”\nAnd Brady’s done that. The numbers don’t lie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:33:47.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
