The Formula one race will be held on Sunday. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno) \nSOCHI, Russia (AP) — A heavy crash for Toro Rosso’s Carlos Sainz Jr. ended the final practice session at the Russian Grand Prix on Saturday. \nThe Spanish driver speared into the barriers at the Sochi track and remained in the car, with part of the barriers covering the cockpit. The medical car attended. \nThe session was immediately red-flagged with more than 20 minutes remaining and canceled shortly afterward. \nSainz’s teammate Max Verstappen expressed concern over the radio to his team, asking “Is he OK? It looked like a big one.” The garage replied that “we lost the power on the car, we don’t know.” \nAt the time, Mercedes’ Nico Rosberg had set the fastest time of the session, ahead of Williams driver Valtteri Bottas and championship leader Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes.
