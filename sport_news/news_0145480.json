The Cardinals (8-8) were seemingly in control after the first two sets, winning 25-17, 25-21 to take a 2-0 lead. The Cougars (7-7) would claim momentum in game three with a 25-17 win and tied the match up in game four with a 25-18 victory. In game five, the Cougars would close out the rally by jumping out to a quick 8-1 lead and eventually a 15-12 win. “We were down 0-2 to a very good team and were able to bounce back and get the win,” Cougars Head Coach Elizabeth Hill said. “Our defense started making great plays, which allowed our hitters to be more aggressive and were able to make Redwood Valley play out of their system.” Paige Richert had a big night, finishing with 13 kills, four digs and four ace blocks. Makenzie Kerkhoff also played well, finishing with 11 kills and seven digs. Abby Jemmings and Natalie Hoffbeck each finished with 21 set assists to go along with 16 and 14 digs respectively. Lauren Boyle had a team-high 38 digs, Kylie Wersal added 31 digs and Jordan Kevelin added 19. Erica Bock, Taylor Rose and Megan Hacker all finished with seven kills. Redwood Valley, meanwhile, has dropped two straight, including a 3-1 loss to Pipestone Area that dropped them to 0-5 in Big South Conference play. “We’ve had moments of good things this year, but now we need to improve our consistency and can’t have lapses in communication, effort or energy,” Coach Andy Regnier said. Chaila Amundson led the Cards with 15 kills, eight digs and six ace blocks. Jaycie Ford added 12 kills, 18 digs and was a perfect 15-of-15 serving with an ace. Maria Bebeau finished with 10 kills, 28 digs and was 18-of-20 serving with three aces. Marissa Mace had six kills, eight digs, five ace blocks and was 8-of-8 serving with two aces. Emma Gaffney had two kills and three set assists, and Frankee Ahrens added nine digs. Ava Lund finished with 14 set assists, seven digs and two ace serves, and Courtney Kretsch had four kills, 14 digs, 13 set assists and was 13-of-15 serving with a pair of aces. Tegan Hicks had a team-high 35 digs and added an ace serve, and Marissa Pacheco had eight digs and seven set assists. In the loss to Pipestone Area, Bebeau had a nice night finishing with 11 kills, four ace serves, 14 digs and 3 1/2 ace blocks.
