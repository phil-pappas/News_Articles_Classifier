That’s 54% and 30%, respectively, slightly better than coin-flip odds. Of the 29 teams to come all the way back and win the series, 10 did so by winning the final two games on the road; the 2004 Red Sox were the last to do it, taking Games 6 and 7 at Yankee Stadium in their famous comeback from a 3–0 deficit in the ALCS.\nMLB Video Estrada shines and now Price must do the same to keep Blue Jays alive by Tom Verducci", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:44:34.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
