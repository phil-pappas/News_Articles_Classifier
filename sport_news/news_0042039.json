The Chicago Cubs are set to take on the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Wild Card Game at PNC Park Wednesday night, but a display of hometown pride for the Pirates was transformed into Cubs pride just hours before the big match. Chicago fan Steve Mpistolarides went into an office building across the street from PNC Park and changed a sign from “Let’s Go Bucs” to “Let’s Go Cubs,\" according to the Mpistolarides family. For those who didn't know, the Pirates are often referred to as the “Bucs.” Attorney: Haunted House Employees Didn't Harass Mother, Daughter With Sex Toys “So we're at a bar right next to PNC and there's an office building that reads lets go bucs,” a Facebook post from Mpistolarides' son Travis read. “My dad goes in the elevator low key to the office and switches it to let's go Cubs. Somehow nobody saw him ‪#‎wearegood‬.” \nSo we're at a bar right next to PNC and there's an office building that reads lets go bucs. My dad goes in the elevator low key to the office and switches it to let's go Cubs. Somehow nobody saw him #wearegood The family even sent the photos and video to NBC Chicago to prove it.
