(Photo: Dave Wasinger/Lansing State Journal) \nEAST LANSING — Shilique Calhoun is all New Jersey and proud of it, but this will be his first time playing there as an enemy of the state school. \n“I got a couple calls, a couple death threats,” the Michigan State senior defensive end joked this week when asked about the reception he expects. “But no, I think they’ll be fired up. I think we love the state of New Jersey and we’re passionate about, everyone that’s from New Jersey is passionate about Rutgers — I’m passionate about Rutgers. \n“But I just so happen to be here at Michigan State because I feel this is home.” \nCalhoun has never been shy about his affinity for Rutgers, but he’ll look to finish 2-0 against the Scarlet Knights on Saturday at High Point Solutions Stadium in Piscataway, about 26 miles from his hometown of Middletown. Calhoun picked MSU over Rutgers in 2011, a middling “three-star” recruit who has become an All-American, a Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year, a two-time captain and face of the program for the No. 4 Spartans (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten). \nAbout 50 family members and friends, most of whom have not been able to watch Calhoun in person, will be there for the 8:12 p.m. kick (Big Ten Network), in a big game for MSU as it tries to find momentum. It’s also a showcase opportunity for Mark Dantonio’s program in a state that has yielded one other player on the MSU roster — redshirt freshman defensive tackle Gerald Owens of Thorofare — and one of the headliners of the 2016 class, receiver Cam Chambers of Sicklerville. \n“New Jersey’s a very active recruiting area,” said Dantonio, who has assistants Mike Tressel and Mark Snyder split a state that previously was combed by former defensive coordinator Pat Narduzzi. “They’ve got good high school football in that state. We’re going to go over there and recruit. And we’re going to always draw somebody out of there, and we’ve gotten great players out of there.” Couch: Time to bring sports betting out of the shadows \nAn Athlon study from 2013 taking the composite rankings of various services from the previous four classes ranked New Jersey the No. 16 state in terms of producing top-200 players (a total of 17), with Michigan tied for 11th with South Carolina at 24. \nBut a spring 247Sports.com study ranked New Jersey No. 1 in terms of producing FBS-level prospects per FBS programs in the state from 2011-15, an average of 44.4 a year — with just one FBS program in the state, Rutgers. \n“I think we do have very good talent,” Calhoun said of his home state. “I think we don’t get as much attention because of how small our state is. And Ohio’s so big, Florida’s so big, Texas is so huge. But when you get a player from New Jersey, it’s more quality. \n“The guy’s gonna want to listen, he’s gonna want to work hard. Because he’s been so underrated and under-respected, he wants to gain respect from his coaches and that was kind of how I was when I came in here.” \nHe chose MSU even though Calhoun viewed Rutgers as “Alabama” in college football stature as a child. \n“I think they were on the rise then, they’re still on the rise now,” Calhoun said of Rutgers (2-2, 0-1), which will be trying to score a program win and avenge last season’s 45-3 loss at MSU. MSU looking for 'A'-level D-line vs. Carroo, Rutgers \nCalhoun is trying to end his MSU story with a national championship, and he’s on course for his criminal justice degree in December. Those were the main reasons he shunned the NFL for one more season in his adopted home, and Calhoun and his 41/2 sacks and locker-room presence are some of the main reasons the Spartans still have a shot. \n“He is a coach on the field, he’s a kid that has maximum experience,” MSU defensive line coach Ron Burton said of Calhoun. “His ability to be around the ball all the time, his effort, is second to none.” \nSaturday’s game \nNo. 4 MSU (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) at Rutgers (2-2, 0-1) \n•When: 8 p.m. 58 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1Ruvo33 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:05:04.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
