The girls also finished first in their Valley Division race with 21 points and an average of 20:25. \nSenior Jordan Price paced the boys, finishing in first with a time of 16:41. Junior Mark Pasquariello (second place, 17:05), senior David Adams (sixth place, 17:29), senior Brent Hofmann (11th place, 18:31) and junior Robert Zeto (12th place, 18:34) also helped pace the boys. \nSenior Jillian Turner finished first with a time of 19:03 to lead the girls. Senior Megan Friscia (second place, 19:55), senior Kelsey Turner (fourth place, 20:18), junior Sarah Zeto (sixth place, 21:18) and junior Lauren Pope (eighth place, 21:31) also fueled the Pioneers. \n“Getting a team title is one of the biggest goals of the entire year,” Price said. “The team win meant more than anything.” \nThe boys felt their biggest competition was Oratory Prep, so they focused on stayed ahead of any runner wearing navy and white. \n“Our goal was to find any Oratory kids and just try to beat them,” Price said. “We came out, ran our hardest and came out with the win in the end.” \nThe girls, like the boys, took a team-orientated approach to their race. \n“Coach told us to go out hard in the beginning and see how the race played out,” Turner said. “We tried to stay together in the beginning as a pack and break off as the race went on.” \nRunning as a pack seemed to work, as five New Providence runners placed in the top 10. \nBoth teams felt the wins were a positive starting point. They both have ambitions of succeeding at the county and state level and will need to run as a team to do so. \n“It gives us a lot of confidence because we know we can pull through against teams that are just as good as us,” Price said. “It will help us compete as a team and not just as individuals.” \nBoth the boys and girls Union Catholic teams placed first in the Mountain Division races with 32 and 24 points, respectively. Junior Nate Papachristos (16:27) and senior Amari Onque-Shabazz (19:29) each finished first in their respective races. \nThe Westfield boys (24 points) and girls (25 points) teams each finished first in the Watchung Division races. 1 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LJz4gM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:14:45.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
