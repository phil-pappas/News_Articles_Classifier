The Bulldogs Isaiah Westbrook looked special last week in a win over West Nassau, scoring four times. Look for the roles of Bolles backs Jaylen McCloud, Will Mitchell and E.J. Porter to grow with the absence of junior Amari Terry, who is out with a hand injury. Bolles’ secondary has been very good this season. They’ll get a test by Columbia quarterback Davin Schuck and receiver Dallon Washington. \nFIRST COAST (1-4) AT RAINES (5-0) \nThe Vikings have hammered teams to the tune of 247-10 this season, with four shutouts. The Buccaneers won this game 62-7 last year. This game looks like a blowout waiting to happen, although don’t be surprised if First Coast hems in the Vikings offensively. As much as the Buccaneers have struggled against a good schedule — their losses are to teams that are a combined 15-9 — they can still play defense well. \nLEE (3-2) AT SANDALWOOD (6-0) \nThe Saints’ start has been their best in more than a decade. A big part of that has been the play of junior RB Logan Wright, the area’s only 1,000-yard rusher. Wright and receiver Phil Benker (508 yards) both lead the area in their respective categories. Take away two blowout losses to Columbia and Raines, and the Generals have been a solid team. They’ve got a good secondary and enough muscle on the defensive line to make this a battle. \nLOWNDES, GA. (4-2, 0-1) AT CAMDEN COUNTY, GA. (6-0, 1-0), 7:30 P.M. \nThe Wildcats ended a five-game Region 1- losing streak with a statement win at Valdosta last week that they are indeed back. Harrison Poole had 89 yards and a pair of big TDs last week for Camden. Beyond its stable of backs, the Wildcats’ defense has been the difference this year. Take away a second half letdown where they got too comfortable with a big lead against Brunswick, and Camden has been a rock defensively.
