I feel badly for the guys in the locker room, but we weren’t prepared to play, and it’s more than the emotional preparation. We all share in it and it’s my responsibility.” \nThe curious game plan devised for the Wildcat offense took another baffling twist as once again K-State came out throwing and bypassing the ground game. The Wildcats’ first two series were three-and-outs consisting of six pass plays: A 5-yard gain, incompletion and 4-yard loss on the first possession then an incompletion, 2-yard sack and interception on the second series. \n“That was what the coaches thought we could do, so that’s what we tried to do,” Snyder said. \nOklahoma entered the game ranked No. 8 in the Big 12 in rushing defense, allowing 190.4 yards a game, giving up 313 in last week’s loss to Texas. Sooners defensive end Matt Dimon said K-State’s game plan was surprising. \n“I am not a game-planner, but if you saw the game last week I would have run the ball,” Dimon said. “That is what we thought they were going to do, but they came out slinging it. They had the wind. I didn’t get a run-block until the eighth or ninth play. It was surprising, but I’ll take what they give us.” \nThe incompletion to start the second series pretty much summed up the Wildcats’ day when quarterback Joe Hubener threw a deep ball to a wide-open Deante Burton, who appeared to slow down near the OU 35-yard line. What had the potential to be a 75-yard touchdown was just beyond Burton’s grasp. \nHubener had a couple of rushing attempts on the third series, which produced one first down, and the first carry by a running back went to Charles Jones on the first play of the fourth possession and went for no gain. \nWith K-State trailing 35-0, Hubener — who was 4 of 12 for 39 yards with two interceptions and ran seven times for 6 yards — was replaced by Cook, the wide receiver who provided an offensive spark at Oklahoma State when Hubener went down with an injury. \nThe change made no difference this time with Cook completing 1 of 8 passes for 6 yards and one interception, which was returned 38 yards for a TD by Zack Sanchez. \n“Anything we could do to try to get some movement,” Snyder said of going to Cook. “You have to try something, and Kody performed quite well in his previous stint there. We had to try to do something; we didn’t have a whole lot of other guys to go to.” \nHubener re-entered in the fourth quarter with K-State trailing 55-0. \n“They hit us early and often and we didn’t respond,” Cook said. “We have to handle adversity a lot better if we want to be successful.” \nK-State (3-3, 0-3 Big 12) was shut out for the first time since Nov. 16, 1996 in a 12-0 loss at Colorado, a streak of 234 games. It was the first home shutout since Oct. 26, 1991, also to Colorado (10-0). \nThe Wildcats reached OU’s side of the field only once, driving to the 15 in the first quarter, but Jack Cantele was wide right with a 32-yard field goal attempt. \n“It’s disappointing,” Cook said. “You’re angry, you’re disappointed. It’s really frustrating. We didn’t expect to get shut out. We thought we had a pretty good game plan, but we just didn’t (do) what we’re capable of. \n“We’re capable of putting points on the board. They (Sooners) played a really good game but you step back and go, ‘Was it about them or about us?’ and coach Snyder says it’s always about us. We didn’t handle our business today.” \nThe blame for this loss doesn’t rest entirely on the offense. The depleted Wildcat defense was equally ineffective, getting gouged by Sooner quarterback Baker Mayfield, who was 20 of 27 for 282 yards and five touchdowns in three quarters. \nMayfield tied Jason White’s one-half school record with five touchdown passes in the first half, giving the Sooners (5-1, 2-1) a 35-0 lead. \n“They just got people in position to throw the ball to, which means we didn’t cover well,” Snyder said. “It’s pretty much that simple. The defensive schemes are designed to be able to defend whatever it is you put out there and, obviously, we didn’t. We have to play the schemes better and find ways to scheme a little bit better as well. \n“Oklahoma did a nice job. They knew what they were doing and found some soft spots with us. We’ve shown some weaknesses that they were able to take advantage of.” \nK-State’s defense was again without safety Dante Barnett, who was injured in the opening game, and cornerback Danzel McDaniel didn’t play after going out with an injury last week against TCU. Midway through the second quarter, linebacker Elijah Lee left when he took a blind-side block from OU receiver Sterling Shepard, and the Cats also lost defensive backs Nate Jackson, Kaleb Prewett and Duke Shelley to injuries. \n“Once again, it’s how you respond,” Snyder said of going to Texas next week with a three-game losing streak. “It’s one of those things that happens in life. You can cash it in or make something positive out of it in regards to motivation to improve and become better and play with greater spirit and do a better job of coaching. \n“This is probably the most significant and major challenge any of us have ever met. It will truly define the character of each and every one of us in regards to how we respond.” \nOklahoma (5-1, 2-1) 14 21 13 7 — 55 \nKansas St. (3-3, 0-3) 0 0 0 0 — 0 \nFIRST QUARTER \nOU — Shepard 22 pass from Mayfield (Seibert kick), 13:56.
