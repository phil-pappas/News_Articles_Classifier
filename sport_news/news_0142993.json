Fifty-six counties are open to fall turkey hunting with just one bird allowed to be harvested during the entire fall season. A valid fall turkey hunting permit is required, and legal hours are 30 minutes before sunrise to sunset. Shotguns using shot, as well as crossbows and longbows are permitted for the hunt. Hunting over bait is prohibited and turkeys must be checked in by 11:30 p.m. the day the bird was harvested. A tagging procedure administered by the Division of Wildlife requires hunters to make their own game tag to attach to a turkey. Game tags can be made of any material (cardboard, plastic, paper, etc.) as long as it contains the hunter’s name, date, time and county of the kill. \nFind a guide for fall colors \nIt’s starting! Already the first splashes of fall color are on maples, ash, sumac and other early color changers, and the peak should come in a week or so. To let leaf lovers find the best of the autumn color the ODNR will offer updates throughout October to help people plan their fall color excursions. Ohioans are encouraged to get outside and enjoy the season at Ohio’s state parks, forests, nature preserves, and wildlife areas where entry is always free. Hiking, biking, running and paddling are fine ways to enjoy the colorful woodland scenes. People interested in seeing the most eye-catching leaves throughout the fall color season should check fallcolor.ohiodnr.gov, the state’s official guide to the changing colors. \nTrapping available on wildlife refuge \nA one time drawing will be held at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 21 for trapping in the wildlife refuge on the Killdeer Plains Wildlife Area. The drawing will be held at the Killdeer Plains Check Station, located at 19100 C.H. 115, Harpster, OH 43323 (1.5 miles south of Ohio 294 in Wyandot County.) All participants must register prior to 6:25 p.m., and must show a valid 2015-2016 Ohio Fur Taker Permit. \nOutdoors study available to youngsters \nStudents in grades 5-12 who love to be outdoors and study wildlife and plants will have a chance to study Lake Erie for a day through Stone Laboratory’s Lake Erie Science Field Trips held each year from mid-April through October. Each group spends two hours on a research vessel on Lake Erie under the guidance of Ohio State University personnel before coming back to the lab for an additional two hours, where they dissect fish and peer through microscopes to get a look at the lake’s tiniest inhabitants. Activities from Herpitology to birds can be added to create a one-day trip lasting up to eight hours or a two-day overnight trip, including a stay in the island dormitory. For more information, call 614-292-8949. \nNew access added to Scioto River \nFishing, hunting and wildlife watching on the Scioto River just became easier thanks to a new boat access at the Mackey Ford Wildlife Area. The new ramp will allow small motorboats, kayaks and canoes access to the river. This section of the Scioto River provides excellent fishing and seasonal duck hunting opportunities just a short drive from downtown Columbus. The Area consists of 200 acres of habitat located west of Ohio 23 on Ohio 762 in northern Pickaway County. \nKnow your ducks, avoid the law \nIt’s really important for duck hunters to know their ducks as three hunters found out the hard way during the early teal season. State Wildlife Officer Jeff Tipton worked Indian Lake by boat and saw three men in a boat set up to hunt waterfowl. As they were leaving the officer contacted them and asked about their hunt. The men said they harvested two teal, but when Officer Tipton checked they proved to be wood ducks. Each hunter received a citation for taking a wood duck during the closed season. \nDick Martin is a retired biology teacher who has been writing outdoor columns for 30 years.
