And Iowa won at Wisconsin. \nThat’s a lot to digest. Here are some numbers for every Big Ten team that played Saturday: \n1 — One team in FBS hasn’t allowed a rushing touchdown this season, and it is Iowa. Navy gave up a rushing score to Air Force, leaving the Hawkeyes as the last holdout. \n2 — Michigan got its second-straight shutout, and did it with two Harbaughs on the sideline. Wolverines Coach Jim Harbaugh was joined by Baltimore Ravens Coach John Harbaugh, whose team won at Pittsburgh Thursday night, so he had a little free time. “One Harbaugh is great, but two Harbaughs are even better,” said Michigan tight end Jake Butt after the Wolverines’ 28-0 win at Maryland. \n(Note: I originally attributed that quote to Michigan quarterback Jake Rudock, and regret the error.) \n5 — Indiana had its first sellout in five years, 52,929 to see the Hoosiers’ 34-27 loss to No. 1 Ohio State. \n8 — Eight of Wisconsin’s 12 possessions ended in Iowa territory. But the Badgers scored just two field goals in a 10-6 loss to the Hawkeyes. \n10 — Iowa is ranked 10th in Clay Travis’ Top Ten for FoxSports.com. \n12 — Maryland quarterback Caleb Rowe has thrown an FBS-high 12 interceptions. He had three Saturday against Michigan. \n20 — Northwestern got its first Big Ten shutout in 20 years, a 27-0 whitewash of Minnesota. \n26 — Penn State was a 26-point favorite against Army, but won by just 20-14. \n28 — Connor Cook became Michigan State’s all-time winningest quarterback with the Spartans’ 24-21 victory over Purdue. Cook’s record is 28-3. \n30 — Ohio State ran 30 fewer plays than Indiana (91-61), but still prevailed. \n31 — Nebraska threw 31 passes in gusty conditions at Illinois. It completed a mere 10 in its 14-13 loss. \n56 — Minnesota hadn’t been shut out by Northwestern in 56 years. \n91 — Illinois hadn’t defeated Nebraska since 91 years ago. In fairness, the Illini had only played the Huskers seven times since 1925. \n105 — Maryland had 105 total yards against Michigan. At home. One hundred and five. \n157 — Markell Jones set Purdue’s school record for rushing yards in a game by a true freshman with 157 at Michigan State. \n243 — Ezekiel Elliott of Ohio State rushed for 243 yards in the second half of the Buckeyes’ win at Indiana. He had a career-high 274 yards, total. Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:51:03.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
