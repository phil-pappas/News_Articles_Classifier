According to Chicago Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg, Rose shot a couple of free throws during practice at the Advocate Center. But it will be a few more days before Rose is able to actually play basketball, and Hoiberg admitted he's not sure if the former MVP will be ready for opening night. Rose is out with a fractured orbital bone below his left eye, which happened in the first practice of training camp Sept. 29. The original recovery plan was for Rose to resume basketball activities in two weeks, but the point guard isn't ready to run just yet. \"They still want him to be a little bit careful just with the swelling,\" Hoiberg said. \"Make sure that his vision is back to where it's supposed to be, to where it was before he got hit, before they want him to get anything going on with his blood pressure spiking is how I understand it. \"So he's probably at least a week away from that happening, where he's able to get out and work up a sweat, and then hopefully it's full go from there to where we can get him out into some contact drills, get him back out there on offense and hopefully get him ready to play.\" Hoiberg said Rose most likely will not play in any preseason games. Opening night of the regular season is now less than two weeks away on Oct. 27. \"It's a long season, you know, 82 games and hopefully playoffs,\" Hoiberg said. \"You want to have Derrick there for the majority of that. Again, we will take a cautious approach with it, but if he's ready, he feels good, and our trainers and doctors feel good then we'll throw him out there.\" Injury report: Coach Fred Hoiberg said Tony Snell has a mild right-ankle sprain, which happened late in Monday's loss to New Orleans. Joakim Noah and Taj Gibson are expected to play Wednesday against Detroit. Noah has skipped the last two games after taking a hard fall last week against Denver. Gibson, who had ankle surgery in June, has yet to play in the preseason. Roster moves: The Bulls released guards Jake Anderson and Stefhon Hannah on Tuesday. The roster is now at 17 players.
