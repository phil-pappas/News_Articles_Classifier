FRANCIS — Greg Monroe still doesn’t know what all the fuss is about. \nComing off an impressive season with the Detroit Pistons in which he averaged 15.9 points and 10.2 rebounds per game, the 6-foot-11 center had a choice to make as a free agent this summer. \nHe could go to New York and play for the Knicks or to Los Angeles and suit up for the Lakers. \nBut instead of deciding between the two biggest markets in the NBA, he picked one of the smallest ones and signed a three-year maximum deal with the Milwaukee Bucks worth about $50 million. \nWhat? \n“The thing that impressed me the most was that you get a Greg Monroe,” said former Bucks forward Marques Johnson, a five-time All-Star and one of the team’s new TV broadcasters. “Has a chance to go to the Lakers, obviously not a good team from last year, but it’s still the Lakers. Still a lot of tradition. \n“You get a chance to maybe go to the Knicks. Not a good team, but still the Knicks. And he chooses the Milwaukee Bucks. That speaks volumes to me about the direction this franchise is headed in.” \nMonroe didn’t think the decision was difficult after hearing the Bucks’ pitch to him. He laughed at the thought that the move might cost him money in endorsements, mostly because he doesn’t think he’s going to be a billboard star no matter what city he is playing in. \nHe was going to make a lot of money whether he played in Milwaukee, L.A. or New York. So he picked a team he feels is on the cusp of doing great things after making the playoffs last season and boasting a starting lineup so young that he is the elder statesman at 25. \nEverything else wasn’t a concern to him. It still isn’t. \n“I’m not a real estate agent,” Monroe said. “I’m a basketball player, and I felt like this was the best situation for me. Obviously, the cities are different. But I believe I can enjoy myself in any city. But that’s not why I’m here. I’m here to play basketball.” \nMonroe has shown early in the preseason what he can provide in the middle for the Bucks. \nPlaying against his former team and in front of his new fans in Milwaukee on Oct. 10, Monroe scored a team-high 18 points and grabbed a team-high eight rebounds in just 25 minutes. \nHe followed that game three days later with team-highs of 19 points and 13 rebounds in a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. \nThose are the types of games Bucks general manager John Hammond likely had in mind when he went after Monroe. \nHe and Bucks coach Jason Kidd did their best to convince him that Milwaukee was the place to call home rather than the bright lights of a bigger city, and they already are seeing dividends. \n“It’s good for us,” Hammond said. “I think it tells especially the people that support us about our organization and who we are today. I say that, to me, that all started when (team owners) Marc (Lasry) and Wes (Edens) and Jamie (Dinan) purchased the team and we started talking about a new Milwaukee Bucks. \n“To add a player like Greg Monroe is an extension of that.” \nHammond wasn’t sure when the offseason started whether his team had a realistic shot at landing Monroe. Free agency sometimes can be unpredictable, but in this case, it worked out perfectly for the Bucks and their newest player. \n“It’s his choice to make,” Hammond said. “All we can do is go in and make our best presentation to him. We are excited to have him.” 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1RSAK8E TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:29:54.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
