Tap your desk. Squirm in your seat.\nOr fidget in any of the 1,001 other ways, something a new study suggests may help counteract the negative effects of sitting for long periods.\nFidgeting appears to improve such markers of good health as body mass index (BMI) and glucose and insulin responses, the study says.\nThat means the nervous and often unconscious movements are associated with decreases in the danger of becoming overweight, having heart disease and dying prematurely.\nRudeness or lack of concentration? Such negative associations with fidgeting may need to be re-examined, study co-author Janet Cade of the University of Leeds said in a news release , “if such simple movements are beneficial for our health.”\nThe study's co-lead author, Gareth Hagger-Johnson of the University College London, said \"that it's best to avoid sitting still for long periods of time, and even fidgeting may offer enough of a break to make a difference.\"\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , analyzed the University of Leeds’ UK Women’s Cohort Study , an examination of diet and health information from 35,000 middle-aged women in the United Kingdom.\nFidgeting, an earlier study found, burns more calories for men than for women, partly because men fidget more, partly because men weigh more and have more muscle.\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
