There is now word there may be more to that report. \nReports from around the country, including ESPN, indicate Taylor has a sprained MCL in his knee and will likely miss a few weeks. The injury reportedly happened on his run in the fourth quarter of the Bills' game against the Titans - a play which helped Buffalo win. Taylor was taken down awkwardly, left the game for a play, but then came back. \nCoach Ryan will not have a news conference until Wednesday, but the Bills tipped their hand a bit by signing quarterback Josh Johnson. It appears E.J. Manuel will start Sunday against the Bengals, as well as in London against Jacksonville. The Bills have a bye week after that game.
