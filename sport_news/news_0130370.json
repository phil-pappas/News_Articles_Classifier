An error by the pace cart added perhaps as much as 2/10 of a mile to the race. Colonial League cross county chairman Bron Holland, the Bangor athletic director, admitted some extra mileage had been run but was uncertain as to the precise amount. \nTurning point: Notre Dame sophomore Charles Hohl passed two runners right at the end of the race to improve from 10th to eighth place, and secure the team win. \nTop performer: Svetik battled to hold off Kemery – two runners who are good friends – for his gold medal. \nWhat it means: The league may be facing another era of Notre Dame dominance as seven of the Crusaders’ eight runners are non-seniors. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
