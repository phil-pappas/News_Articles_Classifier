It was too hard and we need to pick it up and discuss it. \n\"Nico made that one mistake that cost him the race win. So I think it is important that we sit down in a couple of days and discuss it - because we don't want it to escalate in to something bigger. \n\"I don't want to take anything away from Lewis, as he deserves the title. But obviously we need to talk about it at a certain stage.\" \nHamilton, who became the first British driver to successfully defend his Formula One crown with the third title of his career, insisted he did nothing wrong in the incident. \n\"There are always those kind of comments that come afterwards but I would never do something like that intentionally to my team-mate,\" said Hamilton, who joined his idol Ayrton Senna and Britain's Sir Jackie Stewart with a hat-trick of Formula One titles. \nExplaining the banging of wheels, Hamilton added: \"The outside is always the grippier side, so Nico had the grippier line, but I was ahead so it was my line. \n\"We went in, I started to turn but I just understeered into him. We touched but I don't feel like I was aggressive. Everyone has the right to their own opinion but it doesn't matter because I won the race so I feel pretty good about it.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:24:32.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
