It turned out to be a great way to head into the bye week for BYU. The Cougars don't play another game until Nov. 6.\nHere are BYU's grades in its win over Wagner.\nQuarterbacks\nTanner Mangum played six series for BYU, completing 12 of 13 passes for 237 yards and three touchdowns. He led BYU to touchdowns on every drive he played and finished with a QBR of 321.6.\nBeau Hoge was impressive as the backup, completing 8 of 11 passes for 117 yards. His lone passing touchdown, though, came on a screen to David Kessler in which Kessler ran the final 47 yards to the end zone. Hoge also ran 12 times for 49 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n“I felt prepared for the game, personally,” said Hoge. “Coach (Robert) Anae did a good job preparing me for the week.”\nKoy Detmer Jr. completed all three of his passing attempts for 57 yards.\nGrade: A\nRunning backs\nBefore leaving the game after a minor injury, Algernon Brown rushed for 109 yards and two touchdowns on only six carries — 18.2 yards per attempt. Brown later returned to the game but didn't record a carry.\nFrancis Bernard was also impressive in running for 54 yards on six carries. Nate Carter, Colby Hansen and Toloa’i Ho Ching combined for 129 yards, padded by Carter’s 70-yarder in the third quarter.\nRiley Burt did not play because of an injury sustained against Cincinnati, and he would’ve provided a big boost to the backups. Aside from Brown and Bernard, the running backs weren’t as explosive as hoped.\nGrade: A-\nWide receivers\nTwelve players caught a pass, which is a season-high for BYU. Mitch Mathews caught three passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.\nTerenn Houk and Mitchell Juergens each caught two first-half passes and combined for 117 yards. Kessler emerged as the go-to option in the second half, tallying three catches for 78 yards and a touchdown.\nJosh Weeks, Trey Dye and Jake Ziolkowski all showed impressive talent in the second half. Overall, the receiving corps combined for 411 yards and four touchdowns.\nGrade: A+\nOffensive line\nThe linemen came into the game short-handed, but it didn’t stop them from playing exceptionally well. Despite playing without Ului Lapuaho, Ryker Mathews and Kyle Johnson, the line had its way with Wagner’s undersized front seven for the entire game.\nBYU’s quarterbacks weren’t sacked all game, and kudos go to the line for its superb play. Also, the offense recorded its first 300-yard rushing game of the season.\nGrade: A\nFront seven\nIn the same week BYU lost starting linebacker Sione Takitaki for the season, its front seven played arguably its best game of the year. Linebacker Fred Warner led the Cougars with four total tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss, two sacks and a quarterback hurry.\nManoa Pikula led the team with six total tackles, and Austin Heder chipped in four. Va’a Niumatalolo recorded his first career sack in the second half.\nGrade: A", "external_links":
