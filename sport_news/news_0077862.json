The sides had been at a stalemate, but reached a verbal agreement Wednesday, less than a week before the season opener.\nThe team hopes to make the signing official Thursday.\nAfter Thompson declined to sign a one-year, $6.9 million qualifying offer from the team, it appeared he might be willing to sit out part of the regular season. LeBron James had called Thompson's holdout a \"distraction\" during training camp.\nBut he'll be on the floor as the Cavs try to defend their Eastern Conference title.\nThompson averaged 10.8 rebounds in the playoffs last season.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
