The five-play, 81-yard drive sealed the victory for Cincinnati (3-2), which lost a heartbreaker last week to Memphis despite gaining more than 750 yards of offense. \nOn Thursday, Moore’s first collegiate start, he completed 22 of 33 passes for 279 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception picked off by Rayshawn Jenkins. \nUM quarterback Brad Kaaya completed 24 of 39 passes for 255 yards, with Joe Yearby adding 113 rushing yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. \nAs hard as the Hurricanes (3-1) tried to keep up, they couldn’t convert third downs on offense and couldn’t make enough plays on defense when they desperately needed them. \nKaaya completed a 45-yard pass to Herb Waters down the right sideline to put UM at the Cincinnati 8 with less than six minutes left. But UM came away empty when with 4:47 left, Kaaya threw a fourth-down pass intended for tight end Stan Dobard that Bearcat safety Tyrell Gilbert knocked away to secure the eventual victory. \nCincinnati’s defense, which missed tackle after tackle the previous week, suddenly seemed more stout — not to mention the Canes’ paltry third-down conversion rate. The Canes converted four of 15 third downs Thursday, continuing their pitiful run. This season they are 13 for 53 on third-down attempts. \nThe game had inconsistencies on both sides of the ball for the Hurricanes, who were down 27-20 at halftime. \nThe Bearcats turned their first two drives into touchdowns that left the crowd in a frenzy and UM fans likely dumbfounded in front of their TVs. \nAfter Cincinnati won the opening toss and elected to kick, UM marched down the field, eventually thwarted by a clipping call and subsequent loss of one yard on a third-down completion. Two plays later, Michael Badgley kicked a 41-yard field goal to give Miami the 3-0 lead. \nBadgley kicked three field goals for the night, with tailbacks Yearby and Mark Walton scoring the two touchdowns. \nThen came the Bearcats’ magic — 14 points in 1 minute 21 seconds — mixed with plenty of UM blunders. \nCincinnati’s first touchdown: a 29-yard rush by 5-9, 202-pound Miami Southridge graduate Hosey Williams. The play was almost farcical, as Williams entered a cluster of UM players, was grabbed by safety Rayshawn Jenkins, then inexplicably busted through the traffic and sprinted straight into the end zone. \nIts second touchdown, with 9:11 left in the first quarter, was preceded by Justin Vogel’s 59-yard punt that was returned 63 yards by Shaq Washington. Moore then extended the play with his feet, and hit McKay (covered by Corn Elder and Dallas Crawford) in the end zone for the 11-yard touchdown. \nCincinnati had won 27 consecutive home nonconference games at Nippert Stadium dating to a 30-24 win over Temple in three overtimes on Sept. 20, 2003. Miami made it 28. Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:34:22.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
