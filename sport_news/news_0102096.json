In other words, talent is not something ontological, it is epistemic, you and your muscles gain the knowledge of what you are doing by mere hard and smart work. Thus, the cliche of \"classy and gifted\" players simply indicates that these players work constantly to keep their skills in good shape, because you cannot maintain class by doing nothing, but you can keep it alive by always being in good form.What Fatih Terim and the Turkish football media, aka the retired footballers association, cannot grasp since the beginning of the EURO 2016 qualifiers is exactly this too. Given the fact that Iceland, Czech Republic, Latvia and Kazakhstan did not seem \"fancy\" enough in comparison with the Netherlands, both Terim and his fellow friends in the media assumed that it will be an easy journey for the Turkish national team. Nevertheless, their fairytale did not last long. In just the first game, Iceland, who seemed a piece of cake in the eyes of almost every Turk, proved that talent can be gained by anyone at any time. But most importantly, Iceland taught Fatih Terim and all the people ruling football in Turkey that what matters is not individual talent but a good system, and seeing as talent comes from knowledge, Iceland knew how to play this game as a team, while the Turkish players were hopelessly trying to be creative individually. The result was clear, 3-0, the power of collective action destroyed the individuality romanticism that expects players to solve everything in seconds.However, despite these deficiencies and poor perception of football, Terim and his team managed to climb close to the playoff stage, with the great help of an unrecognizable Netherlands. But the real test starts now, Turkey have to get points off the Czech Republic and Iceland, the teams that share the first seat and have beaten Turkey, to throw themselves into the playoffs. It will definitely be interesting to watch what Terim will bring new to the table, given he failed to organize his team to play rationally and collectively throughout the qualifiers. Honestly, I have no direct contact to Terim or the Turkish national team, so I might just guess what he will opt for, which will probably be an unbalanced press by offensive players in the first 20 or 30 minutes and a deep defensive line to prevent any \"accidents\" throughout the 90 minutes, in other words, the classic and chaotic Terim game that focuses on counter-attacks. Nonetheless, this may very well work out against the Czech Republic, as it did against the Netherlands, but this strategy, or simple plot, will never be a sufficient plan to make Turkey a competitor for the top. Finally, it truly does not matter if Turkey reach the playoffs and Euro 2016 as long as the people that rule football interpret things the wrong way. The mentality that worships the product and talent, and misses the foundation of it - hard and smart work - will never grasp the codes of this game and will never be successful at the highest level of football.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:04:21.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
