Platini should have the chance 'to clear his name', a Uefa statement said. \nIt also called for investigators to 'work rapidly' and decide 'on the merits of the case by, at the latest, mid November 2015â€³. \nOutside the meeting, reporters were told by Austrian soccer federation president Leo Windtner that all 54 member nations 'fully support' their president. \nThe statement issued shortly afterwards confirmed: 'We support Michel Platini's right to a due process and a fair trial and to the opportunity to clear his name.' \nowever, one Uefa source told the BBC there was a clear split between those members who continue to back Platini and those who want 'to consider a plan B'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:11:22.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
