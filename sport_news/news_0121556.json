Ben Twingley/btwingley@pnj.com BRIAN ACHATZ, bachatz@pnj.com 5:05 p.m. CDT October 16, 2015 Achatz (Photo: Ben Twingley) \nIn case anyone forgot, I went undefeated last week in #BeatBrian. \nI'm hoping to keep that momentum going, but there are 71 participants this week who are aiming to thwart my success. \nThis Friday, we're back to district play and we've chosen from a slate of eight games. \nThe spiciest items on the menu are likely Tate at Escambia and Navarre at Milton. \nEscambia needs a district win to keep the likelihood of its playoff hopes alive. \nFor Milton, the Panthers are looking to turn the tables in the district after being stunned by Gulf Breeze, but they'll face the Navarre Raiders, who are off to the best start in program history. \nSo, I hope you dialed up the right picks if you participated this week. If you didn't sign up, make sure to log on to www.pnj.com/BeatBrian next week to sign up for the best contest in town. \nNow, let's get down to picking: \nTate at Escambia: This game is a rematch of a Week 11 thriller from last season in which Tate won 27-24. Though they don't have home field advantage, the Aggies hold the momentum of a two-game win streak. I see this one as an intense, defensive struggle. But I think Tate's more balanced offense provides the edge on Friday night. \nTate over Escambia \nNavarre at Milton: It would be quite a story if Milton earned it's first District 2-6A win of the season over the undefeated Navarre Raiders. However, I think Navarre is simply too good to let this one go. Milton's offense holds more balance but the Panthers will face one of the most aggressive defenses in the area. \nNavarre over Milton \nArnold at PHS: I'm convinced the Tigers had a more productive bye week than any team thus far. I think they'll come out hot as the Tigers play host to District 1-5A foe Arnold. If PHS can contain Arnold QB Cody Saunders, they should have this one locked up. \nPHS over Arnold \nWest Florida at Bay: Bay's record (7-0, 1-0) and ranking (No. 7 in Class 5A) say it all. Bay relies heavily on its rushing attack, but I think the Tornadoes will run into the hardest hitting team they've seen yet. Watch for the Jags receivers to go off in this one. \nWest Florida over Bay \nPine Forest at Washington: Here's Pine Forest's chance to take the district by the horns. I see the Eagles coming off their bye and showing massive offense. \nPine Forest over Washington \nGulf Breeze at Pace: This one comes down to Gulf Breeze's pass vs. Pace's run. Though Pace lost last week, I think the Patriots showed big strides of improvement. \nPace over Gulf Breeze \nTaylor County at Catholic: The Crusaders have a great opportunity here. With home-field and the upper hand in the district, the Crusaders can lock up 1-3A with a win. I see Abram Smiley running his way to Catholic's goal. \nCatholic over Taylor County \nNorthview at Jay: This one could be a classic 1-1A rivalry shootout. Northview has shown more defensive consistency this year, and that will be key as the Chiefs head to Jay. \nNorthview over Jay Carl Madison, former Pine Forest High School football coach from 1986-88, tosses the coin Friday before a homecoming game against the Escambia Gators.
