The Badgers have now won four in a row, including three straight on the road. They return home tonight to face a D-III No. 33-ranked Apache Junction squad that's on a two-game winning streak following a 0-4 start. It's a safe bet that Prescott will keep rolling this evening, though.  Flagstaff (3-3 overall, 0-0 section) at Bradshaw Mountain (4-2, 0-1) 7 p.m. Friday at Bob Pavlich Field in Prescott Valley Bradshaw Mountain dropped eight spots in the D-III rankings this week, from No. 9 to No. 17, after narrowly losing its Section VIII opener at Mingus Union. To contend for its third straight section title, the Bears likely must win their final three games and get some help, as No. 10 Mingus has the inside track. Playing at home tonight versus Flagstaff, Bradshaw knows what's at stake and should get back in the win column.  Paradise Honors (4-2, 0-1) at Chino Valley (2-4, 0-1)7 p.m. Friday at Chino Valley H.S. football stadium in Chino Valley In this D-V, Section III clash, Chino Valley hosts a Paradise Honors team that's ranked 14th in the division and coming off a 62-13 loss at No. 3 Joy Christian. The Cougars, who succumbed at rival and No. 29-ranked Camp Verde in their section opener last Friday, will need to play their best game of the season tonight to have any chance at an upset.  Mayer (3-3, 1-2) at El Capitan (1-4, 0-3)1 p.m. Saturday at El Capitan H.S. football field in Colorado City Playing a rare Saturday afternoon game at struggling El Capitan on the Arizona-Utah border in Colorado City, D-VI No. 17-ranked Mayer has an opportunity to get above .500 for the first time since Week 1 Aug. 28, and even its D-VI, Section I record. The Wildcats, who are on the playoff bubble, host defending D-VI state champion Mogollon in their regular-season finale next Friday, Oct. 16.  Bagdad (6-1, 2-0) at Anthem Prep (2-4, 1-2)7 p.m. Friday at Anthem Prep Academy football field in Anthem At this late stage of the season, defending D-VI state runner-up Bagdad is primarily concerned with playoff seeding. If the No. 3-ranked Sultans win out, they are assured of a top-four seed and a bye in the first round of the D-VI state tournament that starts Oct. 24. Bagdad should easily win tonight's Section III game at Anthem Prep and next week's regular-season/section finale versus Valley Lutheran at home, which would put the Sultans in the driver's seat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:55:19.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
