The Stuart Cramer junior golfer continued that streak, shooting a 37 and a 35 in two nine-hole matches to finish with an even-par 72 and help lead the Storm to the school’s first-ever conference title in any sport. Porman came into Monday’s match at Crowders Mountain Golf Club leading second-place golfer Kasey Owenby by 16 strokes and Kate Beeken of Lake Norman Charter, last year’s champion, by 17. The Cramer junior kept that lead intact. Her 35 matched her nine-hole low on the season, and she never shot above a 39. “That’s pretty incredible. That’s par for the whole season,” said Stuart Cramer coach Jim Dobran, who was named the conference’s coach of the year Monday. In her first round, Porman started out four-over par after three holes, but regrouped afterwards to finish with a 37. “She’s very mentally tough. Today I asked her what she was shooting and she said, ‘I’m not sure. I don’t keep track,’ which is impressive,” Dobran said. The Storm had four other golfers earn all-conference honors along with Porman. Sophomore Sydney Baxter finished seventh overall in the conference, followed by junior Jenna Hinson (eighth), senior Mattelyn Hough (10 th ) and senior Scarlett Bethune (tied for 13 th ). In the first nine-hole match Monday, Beeken, last year’s individual winner, became the only golfer to win a conference meet besides Porman. The Knights senior shot a 36 to beat out Porman by one stroke, and finished her season tied with Owenby for second place in the conference. The season will continue for some golfers Tuesday, Oct. 20 in the west regionals. Some of the conference teams will participate in the 3A regional at Monroe Country Club, while others will head to Hendersonville for the 1A/2A match at Etowah Valley Country Club. Dobran said he has high hopes for Porman and the rest of the Storm’s golfers as they match up against the best in the state. “It’s been pretty exciting, people know the golf team exists now and you wouldn’t have thought that before the season started,” he said.
