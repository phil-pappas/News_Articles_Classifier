Dominion jumped to an 8-0 lead on Brandon Mummy’s 75-yard pass to Cody LaVigne. \nIt set the tone, however, on a night that included three combined touchdowns between teams in the second half that were 1:50 apart. \n“We knew they were going to be a handful on defense because they’ve done that to every team they’ve played,” Matthews said of Dominion, which carried only 15 players. “My hat’s off to them. They are an incredibly well-coached team and those kids give everything. They have. I think they just ran out of gas a little bit. If they had more depth I think this would have been a dogfight to the end.” \nDown 8-0 early, it didn’t take long for Trinity to erase its only deficit. \nAttempting to establish its ground game early, Trinity marched 56 yards on eight plays, capped by a Preston McDuffie 6-yard run and two-point conversion run to tie the game 8-8. \nIn all, the Lions scored touchdowns on their first three possessions of the game. \nThe second score was 12-yard run by senior Joseph Cotton. Cotton had a strong evening on the ground for the Lions. He ran the ball 10 times for 78 yards in the first half and finished with over 100 on the night. Even more impressive, however, was the fact that Cotton was able to score in all three phases of the game. \nAlong with his touchdown run, Cotton found the end zone on a 65-yard interception return and a 78-yard kickoff return. \n“I can’t say enough positive things about Joseph Cotton,” Matthews said. “He is our leader on and off the field. He absolutely gives everything he’s got all the time. He’s the type of leader that we need. He does a good job.” \nThe half ended with Trinity ahead on the scoreboard 41-20. Other Lions’ scores included a 53-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tanner Johnson to Jim Vermilyea. Johnson also had a 20-yard rushing touchdown. \nJohnson’s second touchdown pass of the game, a 6-yarder to Austin Hainey, opened the second-half scoring. And then the scoring really took off. \nJunior Luke Vermilyea scored on a 35-yard run as he also eclipsed the 100-yard rushing mark on the night. The ensuing kickoff was returned for a touchdown by the Knights’ Dorian Jenkins. Then McDuffie capped a 3-play drive with a 28-yard touchdown run for the third score in under two minutes. \nMatthews said his running backs all played exceptionally well on the evening. \n“We’ve been trying to teach them to just run and hit the hole,” he said. “They keep taking steps forward. A lot of guys who haven’t played much we’ve been trying to get some carries and they ran hard. We are trying to develop a whole bunch of kids here who can carry the ball.” \nLions 64, Knights 38 \nDominion 14 6 12 6 — 64 \nTrinity 21 20 20 3 — 38", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:36:59.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
