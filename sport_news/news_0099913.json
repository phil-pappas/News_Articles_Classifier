UNF hit .406 for the match, tallying 47 kills and 46 digs. It is the second time this season in which the Ospreys hit over .400 for a three-set match. UNF hit .460 against Tennessee Tech on Sept. 4 at the Dish Tennessee Volleyball Classic. Danica Vukotic led NJIT with 12 kills. Emily Krachenfels tallied 24 assists. Andrea Nieto and Maija Tosic had 12 and 10 digs, respectively. UNF came out with a strong first set, hitting .435 for the set while taking advantage of multiple NJIT miscues. The Ospreys began the set with a six-point run. NJIT had a four-point run of its own that eventually made it 7-5 in favor of UNF. However, a pair of runs allowed the Ospreys to pull away. With UNF up 11-7, a kill from Raicevic sparked a six-point Osprey run that put UNF up 17-7. UNF maintained a significant advantage for the rest of the set and capitalized on a three-point spurt to end the set. NJIT gained a 13-10 lead in the second set behind three-straight aces from Vukotic. UNF chipped away at the deficit and an Edwards kill started a key three-point run that put the Ospreys up 16-15. As the teams battled for control, kills from Van Alstine and gave UNF the 23-20 advantage. UNF ultimately won the set on a Highlander attack error. UNF had another powerful performance in the third set, hitting .487 and making 21 kills. For the second time in the match, UNF used a six-point run to start the set.
