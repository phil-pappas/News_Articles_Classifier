The details of this feedback will remain confidential with recommendations then made to the RFU board.” \nFour years ago the results of a confidential player feedback into the 2011 World Cup campaign were leaked to a newspaper.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:41:55.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
