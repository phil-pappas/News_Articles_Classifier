A clearer scanned copy obtained by AFP today shows a youthful, thickly-bearded Omar wearing a green turban and a waistcoat over his traditional Afghan tunic, as he stares directly into the camera.\nA senior Taliban official who sent AFP the picture said it was originally a black-and-white image that was later colourised.\nThe life and death of Omar remain shrouded in mystery and the new image may be one of only two verified photographs. “The picture was taken while Mullah Omar was a student at a madrassa in Kandahar,” the official said. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:21:14.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
