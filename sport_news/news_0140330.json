More >> As the USC football team prepares to travel to Baton Rouge for this weekend's relocated game against LSU, the Tigers are doing their best to welcome the Gamecocks to Louisiana with open arms. More >> COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - \nGame time has been set after the University of South Carolina Athletics Department decided to move this weekend's game against the LSU Tigers to Death Valley in response to this weekend's unprecedented floods. \nWhile television broadcasting rights are being hammered out, the game will kick off at 3:30 p.m. EST/2:30 p.m. CST. \n“After much thought and consideration, and in conjunction with local and state authorities and with our own University administration, we have made the decision to move Saturday’s football game to Baton Rouge,\" USC Athletics Director Ray Tanner said. \"Changing venues on such short notice is no easy task, and I would like to thank LSU President F. King Alexander and Athletics Director Joe Alleva for their cooperation and flexibility in working with us to change the site for Saturday’s football game.\" \n“Yesterday, we made the extremely difficult decision to cancel classes for the week due to the stress 34,000 students would place on the region’s recovering infrastructure, there is no doubt 85,000 fans would exact the same toll,” University President Harris Pastides said. “In the spirit of supporting our South Carolina community that is so supportive of Gamecock Nation, we have decided to move the game to Baton Rouge. The stress on law enforcement and first responders is too great. Moreover, we’ve had many in the Carolina family directly impacted by the flooding.” \nTanner announced on Tuesday that the school was thinking about moving the game because of the safety of fans trying to get to Williams-Brice Stadium. He said the stadium was in good shape, however. \nLSU announced Wednesday that all proceeds generated from ticket sales, minus the expenses that LSU incurs for hosting the game, will be given to South Carolina. \nCoach Spurriers' Comments on Moving Game \nCoach Steve Spurrier reiterated Tanner and said fan safety was the ultimate priority. \n\"Our team, we want to do the right thing. We want to do what's best for our community here in Columbia, so if moving the game is best -- if the governor, our president, our law enforcement -- if they all think this is the right thing to do, then we're just not ready for a ball game this Saturday afternoon,\" Spurrier said. \n\"We expressed to them it was a public safety issue and they listened,\" Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said. \nPractice will continue and the team is expected to leave for Baton Rouge on Friday. \n“On behalf of the South Carolina football team we want to do the right thing and do what is best for all concerned,” Spurrier said. “It appears the best thing is to travel to LSU. We look forward to the challenge and competing against the Tigers in Baton Rouge on Saturday.” \nTicket Information Announced \nLSU released ticket information Wednesday for the game. Once LSU season ticket holders and students purchase their tickets, tickets will go on sale to the general public on Thursday at 7 p.m. EDT/6 p.m. EDT. Tickets can be purchased at www.LSUtix.net . All tickets will be emailed to buyers as \"Print at Home\" tickets. Tickets will need to be printed by the buyer, then scanned at the gates. \nTickets previously issued for the game scheduled in South Carolina will not be valid at Tiger Stadium. \nTicket prices are as follows: Tiger Den Suite and Stadium Club -- $100 Lower Bowl Sideline and Upper Deck Chairback -- $75 Lower Bowl Endzone -- $60", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:02:09.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
