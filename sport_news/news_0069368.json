Andy Lyons/Getty Images On Wednesday, a report that the NCAA was in the early stages of silently mulling over changing the college hoops season's start date to mid-December got people up in arms clucking about why the idea was good and/or bad.\nAdChoices The proposition was purely a product of hypothetical discussions, and not a formal manifesto brought in front of the Division I men's basketball competition committee for discussion.\nMORE: Final Four records that will never be broken\nYes, that the NCAA's VP for men's basketball, Dan Gavitt, gave the idea credence when he told the San Jose Mercury News “there’s definitely a portion of the membership that thinks it’s worthy of consideration\" is important. But it doesn't mean a change is imminent or will happen in the next few years.\nThere's a good chance we don't see any change in the season's start or end dates in this decade, even. And there's one simple reason why: planning.\nAs it stands now, the NCAA has already selected, vetted and entered into contracts with host sites for every Final Four through the 2021 season . That doesn't necessarily forbid the NCAA and its member institutions from entertaining the idea or relevant suggestions. It does mean, however, that any drastic proposed changes would not go into effect until after the 2021 Final Four.\n\"Within the next year, we will determine additional future tournament sites, using the seasonal calendar now in place,\" Gavitt said in a statement released by the NCAA on Wednesday, adding that no formal discussions have begun.\nThe committee has to contend with several critical issues as it determines whether shifting the season to a later start date would be beneficial to the sport.\nMORE: Final Four logos through the years\nFirst, who would host the NCAA Tournament's regional sites? Traditionally, the NCAA has been able to rent out space from NBA and NHL teams during their regular season schedule. But a later start date for hoops would mean that the NCAA would have to negotiate venue deals around professional teams' playoff schedules.\nIt's not impossible but it's not ideal, either.\nSecond, what happens to the spring recruiting period for coaches?\nDivision I men's basketball coaches typically have a few clusters of days in April after the Final Four during which they're allowed to hit the road and evaluate high school prospects. Obviously, that's an issue with a season that may not end until late May or early June. This could be an easy fix — just push it back — but would take some serious cooperation and coordination. And let's be honest, are either of those two tenets that the NCAA's lauded for?\nAlso, aside from other sponsorship and advertising deals, an NCAA Tournament that begins in April or May would present a TV rights dilemma for Turner Broadcasting. Turner owns the exclusive rights to several rounds of the NCAA Tournament. It also owns the rights to the early rounds of the NBA Playoffs, particularly on Thursdays. Would Turner give up its Thursdays to ESPN or another media entity to balance its financial commitment to the NBA Playoffs?\nThere are a lot of moving parts and vested interests in a decision of this caliber, and even if the committee discusses it — which they should — don't expect to see the change manifest before the next decade begins.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports/2015/10/14/ncaa-vp-dan-gavitt-on-moving-the-season-back-one-month-there-are-merits-on-a-lot-of-levels/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2014-11-14/final-four-sites-where-2017-2018-2019-2020-2021-locations-host-schools", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4635274-final-four-records-that-will-never-be-broken-photos-bill-bradley-bill-walton-bill-russell-freddie-banks", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-10-14/ncaa-march-madness-college-basketball-schedule-football-dan-gavitt", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-03-17/ncaa-tournament-2015-final-four-logos-history-branding-indianapolis-march-madness"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:14:01.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
