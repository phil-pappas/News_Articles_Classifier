Here's a look at what happened.\nUpcoming Games Utah Football Utah football stats & schedule Ore. St. @ Utah Rice-Eccles Stadium, Salt Lake City Oct. 31, 5:00 p.m. 6 Days 7 Hrs 29 Mins 51 Secs More Coverage Utes' goals still intact, but they fail to make correction USC's Gustin, Masina happy to come out on top against their Utah brothers Utah Utes report card: No. 3 Utah's offense, defense receive poor marks against USC Mistakes the difference in Utes' big loss to Trojans Utah's unbeaten season crumbles in L.A. as USC overpowers third-ranked Utes 42-24 Utah notebook: Hil makes it clear about wanting Whittingham to stay with the Utes LOS ANGELES â€” No. 3 Utah's perfect season came to a vicious end Saturday evening as an unranked USC squad knocked off the Utes 42-24 in convincing fashion.\nUtah (6-1, 3-1), the Pac-12's last remaining undefeated team heading into the game with the Trojans, maintains a lead in the Pac-12 South division, but the lead over USC, Arizona State and UCLA has been trimmed in half with the loss.\nScoring recap: For the seventh time in seven games this season, USC (4-3, 2-2) scored first. Justin Davis capped a nine-play, 88-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown carry to give the Trojans a 7-0 lead with 7:59 left in the first quarter. Unfazed by the drive, Utah answered with an 83-yard drive ending with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Travis Wilson to Britain Covey to tie the game 7-7 nearly four minutes later.\nUtah then took the lead after Bubba Poole stepped in on a 2-yard touchdown run with 1:49 left in the quarter. Covey's electrifying 40-yard punt return on the previous play set up the touchdown. Covey broke several tackles and made other defenders miss on his way to the USC 2-yard line.\nUtah's lead, however, wouldn't last long. USC's Cameron Smith jumped in front of a Wilson pass and returned it 41 yards to the Utah 4-yard line. The Trojans eventually capitalized with a 1-yard touchdown carry by Soma Vainuku on fourth down (some fans believe he may not have crossed the goal line) to tie the game 14-14 with 9:47 left in the first half. USC captured the lead for good six minutes later when Ronald Jones burst up the middle for an 18-yard touchdown carry, giving USC a 21-14 advantage.\nThe Trojans extended the lead to 28-14 just before the half when Smith jumped in front of a Wilson fourth-down pass and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown.\nUtah quickly marched down the field, and Andy Phillips kicked a career-long 53-yard field goal to cut USC's lead to 28-17 at the half.\nNeither team scored until Cody Kessler punched in a 1-yard touchdown on fourth down with 3:37 left in the third quarter, pushing USC's lead to 35-17. The Trojans padded the lead in the fourth quarter when Kessler connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster on a 34-yard touchdown pass.\nUtah cut the lead to 42-24 on a 66-yard catch and run by Covey with four minutes left in the game, but by the then the game had been decided.\nUtah's three stars:\nBritain Covey, WR/PR\nWith a career-high 129 yards receiving and a career-high 217 all-purpose yards, Covey either scored or set up all three of Utah's touchdowns. He caught a 30-yard pass to give Utah its first points of the game in the first quarter. His 40-yard punt return later in the quarter set up Poole's 2-yard touchdown run on the very next play. In the fourth quarter, he sped past the Trojan secondary on his way to a 66-yard touchdown catch and run. Within those big plays, he reminded the spectators that he still is one of the most electrifying players in the country.\nGionni Paul, LB\nIt's a shame Paul's stat line, which mirrors something that can only be achieved in a video game, will go mostly unnoticed because of the loss. The senior picked up a career-high 17 tackles, including 11 solo tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, a sack and a forced fumble. In one drive in particular, Paul finished with three tackles for loss.\nJason Whittingham, LB\nContinuing on that theme, Paul and Whittingham picked up the slack nicely with Jared Norris out with an injury. Whittingham tied safety Marcus Williams with second-most tackles with nine, including a 1/2 sack and 2.5 tackles for loss.\nAnalyzing the stats", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:31:22.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
