Just like that, the Mets go from in command to in reverse, forced to hightail it back to SoCal in order to claim this NLDS.\nAnd the Dodgers, the team that approached this week carrying the weight of a thousand ships and 300 million dollars, now have the upper hand once more, for their master plan is back in play: They get to go home, and they get to start the man who might win the NL Cy Young award.\nBecause Clayton Kershaw successfully refuted the myth that he is a bad postseason pitcher Tuesday night, leading the Dodgers to a 3-1 victory over the Mets in Game 4 at Citi Field and tying this series at two games apiece, the lefty’s co-ace Zack Greinke will get the do-or-die start for Thursday’s Game 5 at Dodger Stadium, on full rest, against the Mets’ stud Jacob deGrom, who outpitched Kershaw for the Game 1 victory.\n“We’re going back home, where we get a chance to play,” said Dodgers manager Don Mattingly, whose job security remains in serious question. “So that’s a feeling, to be able to get out of here.”\nKershaw, justifiably showering praise on deGrom, described the series as “probably dead even.” He added, “Definitely glad to be going home. … Just to have the fans behind you is important, if we can get a really going or something, and just the comfortability of being home.”\nEach team is 1-1 at home and on the road in the series. Quite simply, though, you want to hit last in the last game. And the Dodgers now can put their strategy to its fullest test: Make the Mets beat Kershaw and Greinke twice in four tries. So far, the Mets are 1-2 against the duo, having picked up a critical Game 3 victory against Dodgers third starter Brett Anderson.\nThat put the Mets up 2-1 and hoping to avoid another trip out West with a win Tuesday. However, Kershaw, pitching on three days’ rest for the first time this season, threw seven stellar innings, walking one and striking out eight to end a five-start postseason losing streak and pick up his first win in seven playoff attempts.\nMoreover, his third-inning single off his counterpart Steven Matz sparked the game-winning, three-run rally, which peaked on a two-run double by former Met Justin Turner. At third base, Turner made a great stop of a Wilmer Flores bullet to end the seventh, which has been Kershaw’s trouble inning for many of his postseason starts.\n“You could sense some relief after he came out of the game,” said A.J. Ellis, Kershaw’s personal catcher. “He finished that strong, strong outing, and then to celebrate after the game and have a few moments just to really enjoy what he just accomplished. I’m so happy for him.”\nEllis also touted deGrom, calling him “amazing.” The Dodgers for sure won’t walk into Game 5 overconfident. Yet the Dodgers, their industry-leading payroll putting heavy pressure on them and Mattingly, have to feel the best about themselves since this series began.\n“It gets back to a game that anything can happen, honestly,” Mattingly said. “You don’t know how the ball’s going to bounce. Something can go wrong early. You just don’t know. But we have opportunity at least to extend.”\nExtend the series, extend the season. Extend Mattingly’s chances of sticking around.\n“We’ve got an amazing pitcher, too, in Zack and we get to play at home in front of our great fans,” Ellis said. “Really excited to be going home and having Zack pitching Game 5, but also understanding it’s going to be a really, really big battle for us, because Jacob showed us Game 1 just how talented and special he is.”\nThe series is now the Dodgers’ to lose. Can they hold onto the rapidly changing momentum, or will deGrom grab it right back? That this question still matters represents a triumph for the Dodgers, albeit not the sort of triumph that will keep them warm through the winter.\n clayton kershaw , los angeles dodgers , mlb playoffs , new york mets , zack greinke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:12:54.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
