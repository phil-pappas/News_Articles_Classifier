Fewer distractions. Fewer tickets to buy for loved ones in the stands of Tampa’s Amalie Arena. \n“You get on the road, just the guys, I think you can have a real good, sharp focus,” Hakstol said. “It’s got to be us against everybody going into that building.” \nA quick look at many national pundits’ preseason rankings and the Flyers are very much “us against everybody.” To make matters tougher, they’re opening against the reigning Eastern Conference champion Lightning. Are you ready for Flyers season? \n“I enjoy it,” goalie Steve Mason said. “I think it’s fun, but I think it’s nice to get going no matter where it is. I think (Thursday) night’s going to be fun regardless of if it were at home or in Tampa Bay. We’ve been off for quite a while now and it’s nice to get into some meaningful hockey.” \nThe first test is to get by Steven Stamkos, one of the league’s best players, and a line of Ondrej Palat, Nikita Kucherov and Tyler Johnson, the latter being the top scorer in the playoffs last year. In addition, the Flyers haven’t won in Tampa since Feb. 2, 2011, dropping seven straight decisions. \nNo sweat, right? \n“They have a lot of good, skilled players, not just Stamkos and Johnson,” alternate captain Mark Streit said. “For us, you worry about your own game and how you play as a team and how you want to play within the system and to work for each other. For us as D men, it’s important that we move the puck quick, get it to the forwards, up through the neutral zone and get it in and go to work. We don’t want to spend too much time in the D end.” \nFor the first four years of his career, Sean Couturier has been tasked with shutting down the opponent’s top line. The team wants him to be more offensive-minded this year, so he’s likely going to pass that defensive torch to Scott Laughton. \n“I think (Stamkos’) shot is so dangerous, probably one of the best shots in the league,” Couturier said. “He skates well. He has that quick release where he’s dangerous from everywhere when he has the puck. You’ve got to take his time and space away and try to keep the puck away from him.” \nBecause the Flyers are starting on the road, they won’t get the last line change and will have a harder time matching up lines. \n“I want to worry about the pace of our game and the rhythm of our game regardless of whether we’re on the road or we’re at home,” Hakstol said. “Line matchups come into it a little bit, but more important I think it’s about the group in here being able to be in rhythm and to be able to go out and play a hard game.” Raffl’s brother makes it \nMichael Raffl had a smile that couldn’t be wiped off his face. The 26 year old’s big brother Thomas, 29, signed a one-year, one-way contract with the Winnipeg Jets Tuesday. \n“It’s sick. He made me very proud,” Michael said. “Good for him. I’m really happy for him.” \nThomas had been sticking around in camp and wasn’t sure if he’d get a contract, especially because he still had an active deal in his native Austria. Despite his one-way contract, Raffl was sent to the AHL’s Manitoba Moose, but that may not be for long. \nWas Thomas nervous as it came down to the wire? \n“I don’t know,” said Michael, who was also sent to the AHL in his first North American season, but came up to the NHL after only two minor-league games. “I didn’t even ask. I just saw how happy he was about it. It was pretty sick. Probably pretty nervous, though. I can imagine how it is. I was there.” Gudas out, Schenn in \nDespite the way the Flyers’ defense pairs had been set all week, Luke Schenn will be in the lineup with first-time NHLer Evgeny Medvedev. Radko Gudas, who was Medvedev’s partner and a former member of the Lightning, will be the Flyers’ seventh defenseman. \n“(Schenn is) the guy that he’s been rock solid from the start of camp,” Hakstol said. “He’s done a good job and he’s competed hard. He’ll be the guy who’s in that spot. I think it’s a good pair with what the two guys bring. It’s a good combination.” \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com . 1 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1Liqk0W TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:09:43.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
