He is still in the right positions but things haven't quite broken his way,\" Howe said. \n\"I've watched him for a long time now and he always impressed me. \n\"I tried to bring him in several times (at Burnley) and tended to miss out. \n\"Someone like that I really admire. I watched him a lot coming through the ranks at Tottenham and I remember him playing for Millwall against my Burnley side and he was outstanding. \n\"It is pleasing to see him doing well in the Premier League. It is sometimes a difficult journey as a young player when you go out to League One and the Championship as you can feel you are a long way from the Premier League. \n\"He's done it the hard way and deserves all the success. \n\"The key thing for us is to stop him creating chances, but every game I've seen he has been there and just missing out on the final touch. There is nothing wrong with his movement.\" \nHowe is still awaiting an update on the thigh injury which forced goalkeeeper Artur Boruc out of last weekend's 5-1 defeat at Manchester City during the warm-up. \nAdam Federici had to deputise and made a couple of errors but he retains the faith of his manager. \n\"Feds is an experienced goalkeeper. There are not many things he has not seen and mistakes are part of the job,\" Howe added. \n\"The disappointing thing for him was a lot of his good work against City was forgotten because of a couple of mistakes. \n\"What people are going to focus on is the goals you concede and he will be disappointed for himself. \n\"It is a difficult situation when you are thrust into action and you are not anticipating it but we didn't protect him very well.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:22:43.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
