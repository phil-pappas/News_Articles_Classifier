All the demands that they have placed and the obstacles they are facing will be studied by the committee and submit its report by December 15,\" Gadkari told PTI.\nEmerging after a three hour-long meeting, he said: \"We will look into their demands and we will consider what we can fulfill. I appealed to them to call off their strike and they have agreed to that.\"\nConfirming the development, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) President Bhim Wadhwa said transporters have decided to end their stir.\nThey had gone on strike demanding scrapping of the present toll collection system, which AIMTC says is a tool of harassment for truckers, besides seeking a one-time payment of taxes and simplification of the TDS procedure.\nAs previous consultations with the government had failed to resolve the deadlock, AIMTC has also sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention in the matter.\nThe government has proposed electronic-toll collection system in the entire country by December, but the transporters claim this was not a practical solution as a pilot project in this regard was not successful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:18:44.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
