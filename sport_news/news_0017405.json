I think four or five times last year we were up two games and then lost the next three, so we kind of knew we needed to relax and figure it out,\" said Reservoir coach Jamie Bullock. \"We needed to play our game. This is the team I knew I’ve had all season. It’s been so frustrating, and we’ve all been frustrated, so it’s really nice to get this win.” (Tim Schwartz) \nMegan Lieb led the Gators offense with 26 assists, while freshman Sydney Allen came through down the stretch to finish with 13 kills. Amaka Chukwujekwu had eight kills, but was a menacing presence in the middle and racked up four blocks. \n“This is a very big win because (Atholton) took River Hill to five sets, and we came in really scared,” Kelley said. “When we won those first two sets, we were really confident, and as soon as we got to five, we wanted to end that bad five-set streak. I’m really happy we pushed through this. This is what I expect from my team. We’re a good team.” \nThe Gators started the game strong behind strong serves and serve-receive, as well as Sydney Lanham pounding down two early kills to set the tone. Up 9-7, Reservoir poured it on by winning seven of the next eight points en route to a 25-14 first set win. \nIt was a similar story in the second set, as Allen and Enitan Omolewa each blasted early kills. Though Atholton took a 9-8 lead, the Gators again strung together a nice rally by winning eight of the next nine points. The Raiders would fight back, but wouldn’t get close enough as the Gators took a two set lead, 25-20. \n“We had no energy the first two games,” said Atholton coach Rob Moy. “It was like watching them walk through a game. They weren’t really pushing themselves hard enough.” \nThe Raiders rally would start early in the third set as freshman Lisa Zoch started to get hot. She pounded an early kill, and followed it up later with three straight aces to give her team an 8-1 lead. They wouldn’t look back, as Zoch notched four kills and three aces in a 25-18 set win. \nThe fourth set went back and forth throughout, with neither team holding more than a four point lead. Both teams played solid volleyball late in the set, but a three point run that included three assists from Emily Fishkind to kills from Catherina Park, Julia Skibniewska and Samantha Miller put the Raiders up 18-15. Atholton won the set, 25-21, to force the fifth set. \n“We just seemed to come in spurts. That’s been our problem all season, that one team will show up, and I’m not sure who shows up the next match or next game,” Bullock said. “That’s what happened. We went down 8-1 in the third set, and I’m like, ‘what do I do?’ It’s hard. They decided they finally wanted to win, and they found the heart and they won.” \nThough they found themselves down 3-0, the Gators bounced back to win the next five points. The two teams were tied at 6-6 and 7-7, but Reservoir pulled away after Diana Yuille put down a kill to make it 8-7. The Gators went on to win seven of the last eight points to pull through with the win. \n“We didn’t want to lose. We’ve had enough of that this season,” Bullock said. \nFor Atholton, Zoch finished with 11 kills, while Miller ended with 12. \nReservoir (5-4, 5-5) def.
