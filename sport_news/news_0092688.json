(AP Photo/Denis Poroy) more > By BERNIE WILSON - Associated Press - Tuesday, October 13, 2015 \nSAN DIEGO (AP) - It was bad enough for the San Diego Chargers that their fans were outnumbered in their own stadium by Pittsburgh Steelers fans. \nThen Mike Vick and Le’Veon Bell took over in the fourth quarter and the Chargers were dealt a stunning 24-20 loss Monday night. \n“To beat the Pittsburgh Steelers you have to play 60 minutes and we played 58,” Chargers safety Jimmy Wilson said. \nBell scored on a wildcat run as time expired to give the Steelers the victory. \nBell took the direct snap, ran left and was slowed in traffic before diving for the end zone and getting the ball across the line as Donald Butler dragged him down. \n“They had been running the Wildcat before during the game,” cornerback Brandon Flowers said. “Le’Veon is a good back and had but half a yard to get in. But we shouldn’t have let them get the ball down the field.” \nTens of thousands of Pittsburgh fans waving Terrible Towels roared as the Steelers improved to 3-2. San Diego dropped to 2-3. \n“It was time to go to the mattresses, if you will,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. “We had to do what was required to win.” \nBell said it was the most meaningful touchdown of his three-year career. “The game-winner on the last play of the game, that’s what you dream about,” he said. \nVick, having an awful game until the fourth quarter, kept the drive alive with a 24-yard scramble up the middle on third-and-6 from the 41 and then a 16-yard pass to Heath Miller to 1 a play before Bell’s big run. An unnecessary roughness call against San Diego’s Jahleel Addae moved the ball a half-yard closer to the end zone and stopped the clock. \n“It’s not how you start. It’s how you finish,” Vick said. \nSan Diego called a timeout before Pittsburgh ran the gutsy play. \nBell ran 21 times for 111 yards. \nSan Diego rookie Josh Lambo kicked a go-ahead, 54-yard field goal with 2: 56 left. \nThis could be the final year of the NFL in San Diego because owner Dean Spanos wants to move the Chargers to the Los Angeles area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:36:13.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
