(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Kickapoo Lady Chiefs broke the cycle Saturday, refusing the let Jefferson City put an end to their season for the third year in a row. Kickapoo played the survival of the fittest game best, nabbing a narrow 5-4 victory over the Lady Jays to advance to the Class 2 state semifinal round. As the score shows, the victory wasn’t easy. Plus, Kickapoo and Jefferson City have split a couple of matches this season.

This time we only won one of the doubles, so we had to dig our way out of a hole. It came down to our singles players. Our kids have been taking good care of themselves. They’ve been eating right, sleeping right, and the endurance showed.” Only winning one doubles match, the Lady Chiefs knew they had to dominate the singles round. While Meghan Zengel and Annie Lewis fell just short of earning points for Kickapoo, Claire Conway and Raegan Brown made up for it, making the score 4-3 in the Lady Jays' favor. Senior Hannah Anderson and Coral Tracy, a sophomore, were the last Lady Chiefs left on the court, and both knew they had to beat their opponents in order to win it all. With strategy and energy, Anderson won her match 6-3, 6-3. Finally, it all came down to Tracy, who stretched into a third-set test. The Lady Chiefs’ fate came down to her going above and beyond. Kohl said, “I told Coral, ‘It’s like a playground out there. Just have fun.’”“It was a lot of pressure, but I had the entire team behind me cheering,” Tracy said. While the team was cheering, so were dozens of Kickapoo fans. And the cheering got even louder when Tracy outplayed Jefferson City’s Erika Dunn 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, giving Kickapoo the big victory. Kohl said, “I’ve got to really recognize Coral in her final match. Everybody’s match counts equally, but to do it when you’re the only one on the court and everyone is watching you; to step up and not only put a ball in play, but put a great ball in play… that was big.” Anderson said, “I think it was a pretty big win considering it was 5-4, but an even bigger win because we had split with them earlier in the season. But I think we were confident going in today. We’ve practiced together since May, so I think we were ready for today and we showed that.” The win means Kickapoo will advance in the state tournament and play Rock Bridge in the semifinal round 9 a.m. Oct. 15 at Cooper Tennis Complex in Springfield. Rock Bridge claimed the state title last year. Anderson said of her future opponent, “They’re going to be a tough team, but we’re ready for them.” Tracy added, “Yeah, they are tough, but we’ve got nothing to lose. We’re just going to go out there and go for it.” While making it to the Final Four is typically on a team’s to-do list, it’s not exactly coach Kohl’s biggest intention for the Lady Chiefs. “It’s really been a family affair with the parents and the kids,” he said. “They look out for each other; they take care of each other. In the big picture of things, it’s bigger than the tennis. It’s about the friendships, and the memories and the relationships they’ll have for the rest of their lives.” Singles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:14:31.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
