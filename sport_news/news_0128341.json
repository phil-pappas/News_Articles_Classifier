But they already have clinched the postseason, and a win or tie Wednesday in Toronto would seal a first-place finish in the Eastern Conference – and set up a chance to earn the Supporters’ Shield at home on Sunday.\n“Yeah, we’ve put ourselves in a good spot for the postseason, but there are still things to play [for] out there,’’ coach Jesse Marsch said. “We just need to keep going. If you start to think now that we can take it easy, slow down, we’ll start to let a poor mentality seep in. We’re going to keep our foot on the gas pedal and keep going.’’\nThey’ve kept the pedal down all season, which is why a simple draw would clinch the East and the berth in the CONCACAF Champions League that goes with it. A win would eliminate everybody but Dallas in the race for the Supporters’ Shield given to the team with the best record in MLS. A victory plus a Dallas loss Wednesday would essentially clinch the Shield for the Red Bulls (16-9-6, 54 pts.), who would then need just a single point from their last two games.\nThe Red Bulls come in hot after home wins over Columbus and Montreal . Lloyd Sam – who scored in both of those victories – may miss the Toronto game after playing Tuesday for Ghana at RFK Stadium. He is not scheduled to arrive in Canada until Wednesday morning. Gonzalo Veron and Shaun Wright-Phillips are candidates to start at right midfield if Sam doesn’t play.\nToronto (14-13-4, 46 pts.) will be shorthanded: Midfielder Michael Bradley returns from national team duty with a minor knock, striker Jozy Altidore is expected to play Tuesday for the US against Costa Rica at Red Bull Arena, and MVP candidate Sebastian Giovinco – second in MLS in goals (21) and tied for first in assists (15) – is away in Rome to play for the Italian National Team against Norway.\n“Whoever plays, it’s going to be a tough game, and they need points,’’ Marsch said.\nThe Red Bulls play their regular-season home finale against the Philadelphia Union on Sunday at 3 p.m. With a chance to hoist only the second meaningful trophy in the club’s tortured history, the atmosphere there could be even more electric than usual.\n  jesse marsch ,  jozy altidore ,  lloyd sam ,  michael bradley ,  new york red bulls", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:26:27.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
