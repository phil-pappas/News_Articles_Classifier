The union argues the use of such technology outside of games and practice violates the CBA. \n“It has come to our attention that several Clubs are currently using or have used sensors to monitor players’ sleep,” Smith wrote in his memo to players. \n“Because the use of such technology occurs outside of games and practice, we believe such use violates the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Based on this information, the NFLPA has filed a grievance against the NFL and all 32 Clubs seeking an order compelling the NFL and its member clubs to immediately cease and desist from using unapproved sensor devices on players, unless or until such use is approved by the NFLPA. \n“To further monitor compliance with the CBA, the NFLPA in conjunction with the NFL Management Council created a 2015 Sensor Technology CBA Compliance Form which was distributed to all 32 Clubs during the 2015 Preseason. Any Clubs intending to use sensor equipment for health and/or medical purposes (e.g., monitoring core temperature, hydration, glucose level, etc.) must notify the NFLPA and obtain NFLPA approval through this form. \n“Please let us know if your club continues to use sensors outside of games and practices or for health/medical purposes.” \nThe Seattle Seahawks and Philadelphia Eagles are among the teams known to use sleep monitoring devices in recent years. \nAfter the Seahawks' Super Bowl win, cornerback Richard Sherman -- who's now the team's NFLPA representative -- wrote in a column for TheMMQB.com that \"sleep science has paid off for several guys\" during the title run. \n\"Every use of sleep sensor technology of which we are aware has occurred with the player’s specific consent,\" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email. \nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero VIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Inside Slant: Time for Colin Kaepernick to step up | 01:09 USA Today Sports' Tom Pelissero discusses why tonight's game between the 49ers and Seahawks is a huge test for San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
