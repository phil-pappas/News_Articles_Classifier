(Stephen M. Dowell and Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) Alex Morgan showed Orlando what she can do in USWNT's 3-1 win over Brazil \nIt couldn't have been a more perfect start for Orlando soccer fans. \nOK, maybe they could have done without the third minute near-miss by Brazil midfielder Marta that dinged the cross bar, but other than that, it was perfect. \nAlex Morgan, the potential darling of the new Orlando Pride NWSL team, controlled a pass from teammate Tobin Heath in the ninth minute, maneuvered past a defender and then around Brazilian goalkeeper Luciana before sending the ball off her left foot into an open net for a 1-0 lead. \nThe goal drew a standing ovation from the announced crowd of 32, 869 fans and sparked the U.S. women's national team to a 3-1 victory against Brazil in the sixth match of its World Cup victory tour Sunday at the Citrus Bowl. The win extended the team's 11-year home unbeaten streak to 102 matches. \n\"There was a huge crowd here today, so obviously I wanted to show up big,\" said Morgan, who is in negotiations to jump from her current team, the Portland Thorns, to the Orlando Pride. \"I think this team did that.\" Fans flock to Citrus Bowl to see US Women's National Soccer Team \nThe US Women's National Soccer Team played Brazil at the Citrus Bowl on October 25, 2015 \nThe US Women's National Soccer Team played Brazil at the Citrus Bowl on October 25, 2015 See more videos \nCrystal Dunn scored the go-ahead goal in the 48th minute when a shot by Lindsey Horan bounced off the chest of Brazil's goalkeeper and Dunn was there to bounce it right back into the net. Three minutes earlier, Cristiane scored Brazil's equalizer, a shot that soared over U.S. goalie Hope Solo's head into the left corner of the net. \nForward Stephanie McCaffrey iced the match in stoppage time, scoring off a cross from Megan Rapinoe. McCaffrey was one of three players to make their first U.S. appearances Sunday, along with defenders Emily Sonnett and Gina Lewandowski. \nIt was an outcome the Americans were hoping for after tying Brazil earlier in the week, the first match of the victory tour it hadn't won. \n\"The challenging part and the fun part is trying to blend in retiring players with new players and get results,\" U.S. coach Jill Ellis said. \"So, you're trying to weave a lot of things in there, but it's a testament to these players. \n\"In the simplest terms, to be up 2-1 over Brazil and then you bring Carli Lloyd into the game, you bring Megan Rapinoe into the game? There's not too many teams that could do that. That bodes well for our future.\" \nEllis said testing out new players is crucial to preparing for the 2016 Rio Olympics qualifiers in February. \nBrazil by no means made it easy for the U.S., firing 13 shots compared to eight by the Americans. Four of those were on goal, one went in and the others were hold-your-breath close. \nAt least two hit the crossbar as Solo leapt into the air. Cristiane almost tied the game long before the 45th minute, but U.S. defender Becky Sauerbrunn pulled off a miraculous save. \nBrazil's Tamires drew Solo out just far enough before crossing the ball to Cristiane, who shot it behind Solo's back for what looked like a guaranteed equalizer until Sauerbrunn, seemingly out of nowhere, stuck her foot out and cleared the ball. It was so close many couldn't tell whether it had crossed the goal line until it was replayed on the stadium's big screen. \n\"I had fun,\" Solo said. \"It's not often on a victory tour that you can play a quality team like Brazil, so it was interesting. I like the challenge, and at the end of the game it was 3-1, so you can't really have too many complaints. But obviously we have a lot to work on and a lot of video to watch to make sure it's better defensively.\" \nThe U.S. will take the next month off until it plays Trinidad and Tobago at 8 p.m. Dec. 6 in Hawaii.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:09:24.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
