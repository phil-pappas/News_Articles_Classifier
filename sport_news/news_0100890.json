Comment By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 9:00 PM By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 9:00 PM The stage was set for an unraveling. Jackie Schofield had spent the last two days playing some of the best golf of her career. With four holes remaining in the ECAC Championship Tournament, held at The Club at River Oaks in Connecticut on Sept. 28 and 29, the Fairfield University junior was in command, atop the leaderboard and playing with confidence. But as anyone who has ever picked up a five iron knows, you’re only as confident as your last shot. For 32 straight holes, the Hopkinton native had managed to expertly traverse that fine line between birdie and bogey. On the 33rd hole of the weekend, disaster finally struck. Maybe it was inevitable, that a player who had shot a career low the previous day with a round of 73 could make it two days without a single bad hole. For Schofield, it came on No. 8 (due to the number of players, she started the day on No. 12). The hole, a dogleg left par-4 playing downhill, wasn’t in any way intimidating. In fact, Schofield was set up exactly how she wanted after placing her tee shot on the fairway, leaving her about 170 yards from the green. And her approach seemed strong too, at least initially. She put it about three feet to the right of the green. The problem, of course, was that on that side the green sloped down into the woods. The ball took a hard right kick, bouncing into a hazard. “That was the first time in the tournament that I lost a ball,” said Schofield. “I was a little rattled by that.” The strokes started piling up. When she finally rolled in her putt, she had carded an eight. And suddenly, the chance to win the first tournament of her career seemed in jeopardy. This was the kind of hole that causes even elite professionals to unwind, to panic and overthink. Schofield was determined not to let that happen. “I realized it wasn’t even that bad of a miss,” said Schofield. “I thought, 'I’m still playing well, just kept that mentality and that confidence.' I just decided to move on and play how I had been playing.” And that’s just what she did. Tee to fairway, hit your approach, give yourself a chance for birdie. Instead of unfurling, Schofield went back to the plan that had her shooting the lowest scores of her career. She made par on the final three holes to close out her day with a 76 and a 149 for the tournament. “I knew she’d be able to recover,” said Fairfield coach Len Roberto. “When I talked to her she was fine. She was just in a frame of mind that nothing was going to bother her. It was one bad hole and she just moved on from there.” Page 2 of 3 - Then, with players still on the course, came the waiting. She went to watch the Fairfield men play to kill the time. Then a teammate came riding up to give her the news. Schofield had won her first tournament, her 149 besting teammate Michelle Applegate by a single stroke. “I was really happy,” said Schofield. “To be honest, I was kind of disappointed after that hole because I wasn’t sure what was going to happen at that point, so I was just really glad that I still won.” As a cherry on top, the Stags were also crowned tournament champions, blowing away the competition with a cumulative team score of 609. St. Francis (Brooklyn) was the runner-up, carding a 671 for an incredible 69-stroke margin of victory. “We’re all really supportive of each other,” said Schofield. “Between practicing and our workouts and at tournaments, we watch each other tee off, we watch each other come in, so that was really important to me as well that everyone did well.” Making the feat all the more incredible is the fact that the Stags had no exposure to the course leading up to the tournament. Fairfield had played in the Dartmouth Women’s Invitational two days prior, leaving it no time to take a practice round before teeing off on Monday. Schofield’s first look at the course came early that morning, when she and a few teammates took a quick tour of the grounds on a cart. “I actually think It ended up helping because I was all warmed up,” said Schofield. “I had just played 36 holes in past two days so I felt pretty good.” Her scores at Dartmouth didn’t blow anyone away. She carded a 165 (83-82). But her coach saw signs of an impending breakthrough. “She was actually striking the ball very well up in Dartmouth,” said Roberto. “The putts weren’t necessarily falling for her, but she was hitting the ball well. She’s been hitting it well since the season started. It was just a matter of time before she started scoring.” It all came together in the first round, when she shot a career-low of 73 to shatter her previous best of 78. “My irons were really solid that day,” said Schofield. “I was able to get on and close to the pin on almost every regulation. I had five birdies that day that helped definitely.” She was the leader heading into the second round, two strokes ahead of Applegate. She knew her first collegiate victory was within reach, but as she teed off Tuesday morning she did her best to keep it out of her mind. Page 3 of 3 - “I didn’t really want to put too much pressure on myself,” said Schofield. “I just wanted to keep it up with how I felt the first day and just remind myself of how well I’d been playing lately and just play to the best of my ability and get it done.” It was something she had to remind herself more than once that day.
