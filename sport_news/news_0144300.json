Can earn up to $1.8M in incentives from 2016-2017.\n— Field Yates (@FieldYates) October 8, 2015 With incentives, the total value of the extension can reach $5 million, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.\nThe #Patriots signed RB Dion Lewis to a 2-year extension, source said (as @FieldYates reported). Worth $3M base, can be worth up to $5M\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 8, 2015 Lewis signed a one-year deal with the Patriots worth $585,00 in December 2014, according to Spotrac.com . He could have been a free agent after the 2015 season.\n“[The Patriots] gave me a chance and this is how I repaid them,” Lewis said, via The Providence Journal ’s Mark Daniels.\nThrough the Patriots’ first three games of the 2015 season, Lewis has 179 receiving yards, 146 rushing yards, and two touchdowns.\n“Dion has been very productive with the ball in his hands, and he’s been very dependable when he hasn’t had the ball,” Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said during a press conference on Sept. 23. “That’s really the bottom line. Being able to, in the passing game protect, run routes, catch, in the running game read blocks and make good decisions and make yards on his own.”\n15 biggest draft steals in NFL history\n No. 15: SS Rodney Harrison, 5th Round, 1994: The first NFL safety to record 30 sacks and intercept 30 passes, Harrison made four All-Pro teams and won two Super Bowls. Getty Images/Stephen Dunn No. 14: LB Zach Thomas, 5th Round, 1996: Thomas was a tackling machine in the NFL, racking up 1,720 of them on his way to seven Pro Bowls and a spot on the NFL’s All-Decade team in the 2000s. Boston Globe/Barry Chin No. 13: CB Richard Sherman, 5th Round, 2011: In four seasons in the NFL, Sherman has made three 1st Team All-Pro teams and shut down half the field in the passing game. Getty Image/Kevin Cox No. 12: QB Russell Wilson, 3rd Round, 2012: Wilson has made two Pro Bowls and played in two Super Bowls in his first three seasons, boasting a 72:26 TD to INT ratio in the process. AP Photo/Morry Gash No. 11: QB Bart Starr, 17th Round, 1956: Teams didn’t throw the ball as much back in the 1960’s, but Starr made four Pro Bowls and won the first two Super Bowls, taking home MVP honors each time. AP Photo No. 10: TE Shannon Sharpe, 7th Round, 1990: Sharpe wasn’t all that big, and he played at Savannah State, but he was the best tight end of his generation, making eight Pro Bowls and winning three Super Bowls. The Boston Globe/Jim Davis No. 9: RB Terrell Davis, 6th Round, 1995: Davis had a short four-year run at the top, but he was instrumental in getting John Elway a pair of rings. The 1998 MVP became just the fourth player to rush for over 2,000 yards in a season. AFP Photo/Mark Leffingwell No. 8: DE Jared Allen, 4th round, 2004: Allen ranks ninth in NFL history with 134 sacks in his career, a pretty nice career for an afterthought from Idaho State. Getty Images/Jamie Squire No. 7: OLB Kevin Greene, 5th Round, 1985: Greene’s 160 career sacks rank third all-time, and he made the Pro Bowl with four different teams in his 15-year career. AP Photo/Chuck Burton No. 6: DE Richard Dent, 8th Round, 1983: Dent racked up 137.5 sacks and made 4 All-Pro teams in his career. He also won Super Bowls with the Bears and the 49ers. AP Photo/Frank Polich No. 5: DE Deacon Jones, 14th Round, 1961: Jones is credited with coining the “sack” term, and while they didn’t keep official record until the 1980s, Jones is considered one of the game’s best pass rushers ever. AP Photo No. 4: QB Johnny Unitas, 9th Round, 1955: Unitas made 10 Pro Bowls and won three NFL championships with the Baltimore Colts. Too bad the team that drafted him (Pittsburgh) released him. AP Photo No. 3: QB Roger Staubach, 10th Round, 1964: The Cowboys had to wait until 1969 for Staubach to fulfill his military commitment to the Navy. Two Super Bowls, Five Pro Bowls, and an MVP Award later, he was worth the wait. AP Photo/Joe Caneva No. 2: QB Joe Montana, 3rd Round, 1979: Montana went to eight Pro Bowls, won two MVPs, and was “Joe Cool” in the clutch. He won four Super Bowls with the 49ers. AP Photo No. 1: QB Tom Brady, 6th Round, 2000: What is there to say? Six Super Bowl appearances, four titles, two NFL MVPs, ten Pro Bowls — Brady is the biggest steal in league history.
