Seven Toyota models come with hybrid powertrains for 2016.\nWhile some hybrid buyers want to proudly display their concern for the environment with a uniquely styled hybrid-only vehicle, others will opt to slip by largely unnoticed in a hybrid version of a conventional model such as the Camry Hybrid SE. The cognoscenti will notice subtle hybrid badging, the Toyota logo accented in blue and perhaps someone driving too slowly.\nIts redesign for 2015 removed the Toyota Camry from contention as the poster car for the automobile as appliance. Your kid will still probably not be asking for the Hot Wheels version this Christmas, but designers did sharpen up the styling much like what's been going on at luxury division Lexus with some success.\nTo get the tech stuff out of the way, the Camry Hybrid uses an electric motor and battery pack along with a gasoline engine. Power to the wheels switches automatically between gasoline and electric, or a combination of both depending on demand. Together the system produces a total of 200 horsepower. Lower-speed driving can be accomplished via electric power only, therefore burning no gasoline. Thirty miles per hour to highway speeds becomes the responsibility of the gas engine, with the electric motor there to augment it. The 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine uses the Atkinson cycle, a modification optimizing efficiency. The engine also recharges the battery pack, as does energy recaptured from braking.\nEPA fuel mileage estimates are 40 miles per gallon for both city and highway. Most hybrids see the biggest advantage in the city, due to the aforementioned low speed electric-only driving. Keep this in mind if you do a lot of highway driving.\nWith Eco Mode selected, my trips in town and the occasional urban expressway jaunt averaged in the mid-30s, though I did see the 40s a few times. Eco Mode allows more electric-only driving and modulates the air conditioning, which is a power drain. Driving repeated loops with Eco Mode on or off showed a significant difference in fuel mileage.\n2015 Toyota Camry wears major makeover well Robert Duffer For 12 years running, the Toyota Camry has been the best-selling car in America, prized for its reliability, well-equipped value, safety and endurance.

The Camry doesn't excite, and most car buyers don't care. But as more buyers shift to crossovers, the midsize segment has contracted, and automakers...\n(Robert Duffer) Given Toyota's experience in hybrid drive, it should not surprise anyone that the system works well. Issues with hybrids can include grabby brakes, since they are doing double duty in stopping the car and converting heat to kinetic energy via regenerative braking. The Camry Hybrid's feel completely normal. Some hybrids don't seem to coast easily when you let off the gas pedal, but not the Camry. Hardest to mask may be the transitions between gas and electric power, when the gas engine starts up or shuts off. If and when the Camry Hybrid's gas engine kicks in right from a stop, you can tell only if you are paying close attention. At a roll, it is basically impossible to discern when the gas engine turns on or off. This car is really quiet. Virtually the only noise it makes is a low whine when you come to or leave a stop. The fact that the engine usually isn't running at a stop enhances the silent effect.\nChasing the functions of the Camry Hybrid has an addictive quality. Choose the Energy Monitor on the center infotainment screen, and you see a diagram of what the hybrid system is doing. Additionally a small green indicator lights up on the gauge cluster when you are in EV mode, meaning running on electric power only.\nDo hybrid cars save money? Robert Duffer, Chicago Tribune There are some questions that mankind has puzzled over since the beginning of time: Why are we here? What happens after we die? Why do men have nipples? Is a hybrid car worth it?\nThat last question isn’t as old as the rest. Since Honda introduced the first mass-produced hybrid with the Insight...\nThere are some questions that mankind has puzzled over since the beginning of time: Why are we here?

Since Honda introduced the first mass-produced hybrid with the Insight...\n(Robert Duffer, Chicago Tribune) Keeping up the pace of modern traffic means the gas engine will kick in from a stop, but get it up to speed, and you can cruise for several blocks in electric-only, provided you drive as if there's an egg between your foot and the accelerator. In stop-and-go traffic or crawling around residential streets, it's feasible to stay in electric mode for quite a while.\nPress the EV Mode button, and it will lock out the engine and drive up to 1.6 miles at low speeds on electric power, provided the battery pack has sufficient charge, which I found it generally does not have when you have already been city driving. Other than the two extra mode buttons, the controls look conventional with the exception of the mysterious \"B\" on the shifter indicating an engine braking feature.\nIgnore all the electric business, and the Camry Hybrid responds like a normal car. Toyota states acceleration times fall in between the four-cylinder and V-6. The ride over bumpy roads was firmer than I'd expected; Toyota does cite a sport-tuned suspension arrangement added to the SE. On the plus side, it felt stable while cornering with a solid feel overall.\nPaint work and panel fit exhibited high finish quality. A tasteful use of chrome and attractive alloy wheels complemented the look of the SE trim level. Competitive midsize accommodations equivalent to the conventional Camry were trimmed out in black with some bright red stitching as a sporty accent. The upholstery cloth was monochromatic though woven in a hypnotic pattern.\nThough I have been rather skeptical of the financial case for hybrids in the past, a price premium for the added complexity of hybrid drive is less common now, and in Toyota's case economies of scale are in effect. The Camry Hybrids are priced exactly in between the four-cylinder gas-only and V6 models, so the equation works.\nAndy Mikonis is an automotive freelancer.\n2016 Toyota Camry SE at a glance\nType: Midsize sedan\nBase price: $27,995\nPrice as tested: $28,985 (excluding $825 delivery)\nEPA mileage: 40 city, 40 highway\nEngine: 2.5-liter inline-4 and hybrid electric drive\nTransmission: continuously variable\nParting shot: High-tech fuel sipper blends in as mainstream midsize sedan.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Toyota Motor Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-539af6eb/turbine/chi-do-hybrid-cars-save-money-20140612", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-550c7043/turbine/sc-cons-0319-autoreview-2015-toyota-camry-20150316", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625165b/turbine/sc-toyota-camry-hybrid-autoreview-1022-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:53:13.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
