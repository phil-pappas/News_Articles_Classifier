Editor's Picks NBA sends support to Lamar Odom \nLamar Odom's hospitalization has players and teams across the NBA sending their support \nA source told ESPN on Wednesday that Odom is fighting for his life and \"the next 48 hours are critical.\" \nNevada authorities have taken a blood sample from Odom to find out if he overdosed on drugs or alcohol, but the results could take several weeks. \nNye County Sheriff's Detective Michael Eisenloffel said at a news conference Wednesday that Las Vegas police will be doing the testing. \nEisenloffel described the enhancers as supplements and said Odom bought them at the brothel. \nDennis Hof, who owns Love Ranch and other legal brothels in Nevada, said his staff picked up Odom from a home in Las Vegas on Saturday. \n\"He just wanted to get away, have a good time and relax,'' Hof told The Associated Press in a phone interview. Lamar Odom had been doing cocaine and had taken sexual performance enhancers over three days at the Love Ranch brothel, pictured above, according to the 911 caller who found him unconscious. AP Photo/Chris Carlson \nHof said Odom was \"happy, he was sleeping every night\" while visiting, but two women went to check on Odom on Tuesday afternoon, after not hearing from him since early morning, and they found him face down and unconscious. When they turned him on his side at the direction of a 911 operator, Odom started \"throwing up all kinds of stuff.\" \nHof said Odom had been taking herbal Viagra and had drunk part of a bottle of cognac since arriving, but Hof had no knowledge of Odom's use of any other drugs. \nOdom, who won two NBA championships with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010, last played in the NBA in 2013. He saw recent reality TV fame through his four-year marriage to Khloe Kardashian. \nKardashian, who filed for divorce in 2013 citing irreconcilable differences, has been by Odom's side at the hospital since Tuesday evening, a source close to the Kardashians told The Associated Press. \nLakers star Kobe Bryant , who exited Tuesday's exhibition game -- also in Las Vegas -- in the third quarter for a lower leg contusion, visited the hospital, sources told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak visited the hospital as well. \nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:40:22.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
