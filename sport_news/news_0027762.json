Jake Roth Oct 16, 2015 at 7:42p ET 0Shares \nCLEVELAND (AP) -- Browns backup quarterback Johnny Manziel admitted to police he drank alcohol before he was pulled over following a dispute with his girlfriend while driving on a highway. \nManziel was questioned by Avon, Ohio, police following the incident with girlfriend Colleen Crowley. \nA witness told police Crowley was attempting to exit Manziel's speeding vehicle as the quarterback tried to keep her in the car. Police said Manziel told them he had two alcoholic drinks earlier in the day. Manziel wasn't charged and Crowley told police she didn't want to press charges against the former Heisman Trophy winner. \nManziel spent 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehab facility during the offseason for treatment of an unspecified condition. \nBrowns general manager Ray Farmer released a statement Friday night. \n\"It is a matter that we take seriously and have expressed our concerns to Johnny directly,\" Farmer said. \"Those conversations will remain private and we will refrain from further comment at this time.\" \nManziel started and won one game for the Browns this season and is currently backing up starter Josh McCown . Manziel made two starts last year during a turbulent rookie season. \nAccording to the police report, officers noticed an abrasion on Crowley's arm, but said it was caused by Manziel restraining her from jumping from the car. \nBrowns linebacker Paul Kruger arrived at the scene while Manziel was being questioned. \nThe Browns had been impressed with Manziel's attitude and commitment this season. That wasn't the case during his rookie season when he struggled on and off the field, leading to speculation about the first-round pick's future. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:12:44.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
