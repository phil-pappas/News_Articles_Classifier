On Wednesday, though, the university announced that Bevo XIV (the current Bevo, dating to 2004) had a life-threatening illness and would not make the trip from Austin for Thursday’s event or Saturday’s game. As the Longhorns, coming off a 50-7 loss to then-No. 4 Texas Christian last week, limped toward the season’s midpoint with a 1-4 record at the same time that Bevo fought for his life, the metaphor wrote itself. In particular, Saturday’s game against undefeated No. 10 Oklahoma emerged as an inflection point for the team and its second-year head coach, Charlie Strong. In an upset Saturday, the Longhorns beat the Sooners (4-1), 24-17, perhaps granting themselves and Strong two weeks’ reprieve of widespread doubting before they travel to Kansas State on Oct. 24.

Dan Neil, an offensive lineman who played in the 1990s, added, “If you’re looking to straighten yourself out, O.U’.s the remedy.” Texas is still just 2-4, though. At the center of questions over Texas’ performance is Strong. When he was hired in January 2014 to replace Mack Brown, the coach of 16 seasons, he was hailed as ready for prime time, having established Louisville as a contender during the previous few years. He became the first black head football coach in Longhorns history. Two years later, Strong is 8-11 and 6-6 in the Big 12. The man who hired him, Steve Patterson, resigned as athletic director last month after less than two years on the job amid criticism that he was out of touch with donors and fans. \nAdvertisement See More » Strong earned his stripes as a defensive coach under Steve Spurrier at Florida, Lou Holtz at South Carolina and Urban Meyer, again at Florida. In his final season at Louisville, 2013, the Cardinals went 12-1 and finished No. 15 on the strength of the Football Bowl Subdivision’s best defense and second-stingiest scoring defense. Things have gone differently at Texas. In 2014, Texas’ No. 33 scoring defense was respectable in the high-flying Big 12. This season, the Longhorns ranked 114th in the category heading into Saturday’s showdown, allowing 38.2 points per game. At a news conference Monday, Strong was asked, “Do you worry that you might not even get to Year 3 at all?” Graphic: 2015 Heisman Trophy Watch He replied: “Every day is a battle, so I don’t. I have no idea.” Last week, Strong’s underclassmen bickered openly with the upperclassmen, who were recruited during the Brown era. Though Brown’s teams won one national championship and played in a second title game, they were just 30-21 during his final four seasons. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story After safety Dylan Haines, a junior, told reporters that some younger players were not putting in the necessary work, several players responded on social media. None were more forceful than wide receiver DeAndre McNeal, a freshman, who tweeted, “Us ‘FRESHMAN’ are go getters and we don’t accept mediocre ANYTHING we are here to pull Texas out the drought.” The incident lent credence to one positive narrative about Strong — that he inherited players from Brown who are high on entitlement and low on talent — while raising the issue of team cohesiveness. The talent deficit is undeniable. In 2014, Texas had no players drafted into the N.F.L. for the first time in 76 years, and it is not expected to have any draftees after this season, either. “I think he’s a really good coach,” Ricky Williams, the running back who won the 1998 Heisman Trophy with the Longhorns, said of Strong, “but I don’t think he has all the players and types of players he’d like to have.” Citing linebacker Malik Jefferson and cornerback Kris Boyd — both freshmen whom Strong recruited — Williams added, “First time I’ve ever seen it with my own eyes, where a good chunk of the leadership came from underclassmen.” Texas is certainly better than its dismal record. Before Saturday’s game, the Longhorns’ five opponents were 21-4 combined. (Rice, which was 2-3 heading into Saturday, was the only team Texas had beaten.) The redshirt freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard has showed some promise, although he became a starter only after Texas was mauled, 38-3, by Notre Dame, currently No. 15, in the season opener.

In between the punishment meted out by the Fighting Irish and the Horned Frogs, Texas suffered two excruciatingly close losses: one in which a would-be game-tying extra point was missed, handing California, now ranked No. 23, a 45-44 victory, and one in which a punter dropped the snap near the end of a tied game, setting up a go-ahead field goal by then-No. 24 Oklahoma State. “It’s been tough to watch the way they’ve lost some of the games,” Williams said before Saturday’s game. “They could be 3-2, and that makes it harder.” But mitigating circumstances and the promise of Strong’s young recruits could be forgotten should Texas finish worse than it did last year, when it went 6-7. The Longhorns’ remaining schedule includes ever-dangerous Kansas State, high-scoring Texas Tech and No. 3 Baylor. While it is widely thought that the midseason ascension of the interim athletic director, Mike Perrin, bought Strong another season, that calculus could change should an attractive candidate like the Philadelphia Eagles’ Chip Kelly or Alabama’s Nick Saban, whom Texas reportedly tried to hire to replace Brown, becomes available. Several observers who understand the new realities of college football suggested that Longhorns fans would need to adjust their Texas-size expectations no matter what happens, because scholarship limits, maverick coaching styles and broadly distributed television revenue have conspired to level the playing field and banish the days when the Longhorns could plausibly expect to compete for a conference title nearly every year. Where Texas was once, by far, the most popular program in the country’s most football-mad state, it now must contend with successful upstarts like Baylor and T.C.U., a newly turbocharged Texas A&M and national recruiting strategies in which teams from the Pacific-12, Big Ten and elsewhere routinely raid the Lone Star State for talent. “Everybody can be good today,” said Barry Switzer, who had a 9-5-2 record in the Red River game as Oklahoma’s coach from 1973 to 1988. “Used to be dominant teams. Now, everybody can beat everybody.” Walker agreed. “We’ve always expected kids to come, because we were the team,” he said. “But we’re not the team anymore.” A version of this article appears in print on October 11, 2015, on page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Longhorns See Sooners As a Cure For Their Ills.
