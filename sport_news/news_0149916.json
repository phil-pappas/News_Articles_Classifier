Ryan in 1973 was the most recent while Trucks did it in 1952 and Reynolds did it in 1951. Vander Meer threw his no-hitters in consecutive starts in 1938. \nScherzer walked none and struck out nine in a row between the sixth and ninth. He got to a three-ball count just twice. \nAnd just like in his no-hitter against the Pirates - when Scherzer retired the first 26 batters before hitting pinch-hitter Jose Tabata with a pitch - he missed perfection by one batter. \nCatcher Kevin Plawecki hit a routine grounder to third leading off the sixth, but the throw from Yunel Escobar bounced and first baseman Clint Robinson could not corral it. Plawecki was forced on a one-out grounder by pinch-hitter Daniel Murphy and Scherzer ended the inning by striking out right fielder Curtis Granderson. \nOther than that, a depleted Mets lineup - Murphy, first baseman Lucas Duda, third baseman David Wright, catcher Travis d'Arnaud and left fielder Yoenis Cespedes all got the night off after New York fell, 3-1, in the opener - didn't come close to getting a hit against Scherzer, who got better as the innings piled up on a 54-degree night. \nScherzer struck out seven straight between the sixth and eighth and whirled off the mound after recording the final outs of the seventh and eighth. In the ninth, he struck out a pair of pinch-hitters, Cespedes and Duda, before right fielder Curtis Granderson popped out to Escobar. Scherzer pounded his right fist into his glvoe before being mobbed by teammates. \nThe National League East champion Mets were no-hit for the second time this season. San Francisco Giants right-hander Chris Heston did it on June 9. The Mets' NL Division Series opponent, the Los Angeles Dodgers, has also been no-hit twice. \nCatcher Wilson Ramos had a sacrifice fly and second baseman Dan Uggla homered for the Nationals (83-78). \nRight-hander Matt Harvey (13-8) took the loss after allowing an unearned run on four hits and no walks while striking out 11 over six innings for the Mets (89-72).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:48:23.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
