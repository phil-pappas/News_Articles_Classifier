Photograph by: TROY FLEECE , Regina Leader-Post \nCALGARY - The Calgary Stampeders acquired running back Jerome Messam and a 2016 fifth-round draft pick from the Saskatchewan Roughriders for kicker Tyler Crapigna, a 2016 third-round selection and a negotiations list player. \nThe move came prior to the 4 p.m. ET trade deadline. \nIt's the second deal Saskatchewan made Wednesday, earlier shipping veteran quarterback Kevin Glenn to Montreal for a 2016 fifth-round draft pick. \nThe Riders (2-13) have been eliminated from playoff contention. \nMessam, 30, of Brampton, Ont., is the CFL's second-leading rusher with 826 yards. \nThe six-foot-three, 245-pound Messam will provide insurance for the Stampeders (11-4) as starting running back Jon Cornish of New Westminster, B.C., three times the league's top Canadian, has missed time this season with finger injury and won't play against Toronto on Saturday due to neck stiffness. \nCalgary selected Crapigna in the fifth round (No. 40 overall) of the 2014 CFL draft out of McMaster. The Ottawa native left the Marauders as Canadian university football's all-time leader with 84 career field goals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:41:02.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
