This guy is in deep after embezzling thousands of dollars from a non-profit children's organization. William Jacobvitz is treasurer for the New York Gotham's Little League account. He was indicted in Manhattan Supreme Court on Friday on charges of embezzling $90,000. Like Us on Facebook \nJacobvitz is the sole volunteer who has access to the New York Gotham's bank account. The 56-year old reportedly withdrew multiple times from the teams account. He allegedly visited the account more than 50 times between November 2011 and April 2014. He also used a debit card associated with the account to pay nearly $3,000 worth of repairs on his car, relayed prosecutor Catherine McCaw. \n\"This defendant is accused of committing a big theft from a beloved Little League organization,\" District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement. \"Many nonprofits rely on charitable donations to support programs benefitting the communities they serve, and in this case, the defendant is charged with misappropriating tens of thousands of dollars that may have otherwise have gone toward scholarships for aspiring young athletes.\" \nThe youth baseball league serves as a program to provide athletic training to teens, many from underprivileged families, according to court papers, writes the New York Post . \nJacobvitz was arrested on Friday at his Upper West Side apartment. Gawker cites, he was later arraigned on a count of grand larceny. Looks like it was time to come clean as he was coincidentally wearing a baseball t-shirt that read \"Step Up To The Plate.\" Jacobvitz initially admitted to stealing fro the account, but tried to deny the actual amount he had taken over the years. \"He said $20,000, then $50,000 when pressed, when in reality he took in excess of $90,000,\" McCaw informed the judge. \nThe former treasurer's actions were uncovered on Friday when another Little League employee started demanding to see the organization's bank records, to which Jacobvitz denied access. \n\"The defendant tried to put her off for weeks and tried conceal the theft by trying to show her spreadsheets,\" said McCaw. \nAlthough McCaw asked for the judge to set Jacobvitz's bail at $50,000 due to the severity of the case, it was set at $20,000 after his lawyer reminded the judge this is Jacobvitz first criminal offense.
