De Groote West Hawaii Today jdegroote@westhawaiitoday.com \nHONOKAA — Kamehameha-Hawaii enforced a strict no-fly zone policy in Honokaa on Friday night. \nThe Warriors picked off Honokaa quarterback Nainoa Falk six times and pitched its second consecutive shutout on the way to a 35-0 win over the Dragons. \nKamehameha-Hawaii running back Kaeo Batacan got dirty early. Fresh off a 40 carry game against Konawaena, the senior back accounted for 12 first quarter touches. He finished the contest with three touchdowns and 114 yards on 21 carries. \nSophomore quarterback DallasJ Duarte had an efficient game, completing 16-of-19 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown. His favorite targets Friday night were Kainalu Whitney and Israel Bowden. The duo combined for nine catches and had 90 yards apiece. \nBatacan started the scoring early for Kamehameha, plunging into the end zone on a 1-yard run on the Warriors’ first drive. The score was set up by a 38-yard completion from Duarte to Whitney. \nHonokaa pinned Kamehameha deep with a punt on its next possession, and Trent Tavares picked off Duarte to set up Honokaa at the Warriors’ 20. But Falk would be sacked for a 10-yard loss on the first play after the turnover, and then tossed an interception to Kailikea Kekuawela. \nDuarte bounced back from his only mistake of the game, finding Bowden on a short swing pass and he turned on the jets for a 38-yard score down the sideline. \nHonokaa could not capitalize on its first half opportunities, including a hot potato fumble that gave them the ball inside the Kamehameha 30, which ended in a Bayley-Allen Manliguis interception. \nDespite all that went right in the first quarter for the Warriors — including holding the Dragons to negative total yardage — they entered the break with just a 14-0 lead. \nThe second half started a lot like the first. Honokaa looked downfield, and Manliguis was there to pick it off — his second of the game. David Kalili also had a pair of picks in the contest. \nDuarte continued the efficient passing attack, finding Whitney in the flats and the senior turned it up field for a 15-yard gain. Batacan finished the drive with a 9-yard scamper into the end zone, his second score of the night. \nSean Chin completed the six-pack of picks for Kamehameha, and Batacan punched in his third score of the night, again from nine yards out. \nWith most of the starters on the bench, Kaimialoha Like closed out the scoring for Kamehameha with an 11-yard pass to Noah Perreira. \nKamehameha 7 7 14 7 — 35 \nHonokaa 0 0 0 0 — 0 \nScoring summary \nKAM — Kaeo Batacan 1-yard run (kick good) 9:45 \nSecond quarter \nKAM — Israel Bowden 38-yard reception (kick good) 11:23 \nThird quarter \nKAM — Batacan 9-yard run (kick good) 7:06 \nKAM — Batacan 9-yard run (kick good) 2:03 \nKAM — Kaimialoha Like 11-yard pass to Noah Perreira (kick good) 1:21 Search Site", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:11:36.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
