He started off by saying Rodgers “has become the surest bet in the NFL.” And after listing every imaginable statistic possible, all of which has you-know-who on top, he ends by saying, “And right now the best player in the NFL is playing the best football of his career.” I try not to be too much of a “homer,” the term used to describe members of the media who stand up in the press box and cheer when the team they are covering scores a touchdown. And I’ll admit that Rodgers is terrific and that once upon a time, so was Peyton Manning. But hold on there just a minute! There is a quarterback for the New England Patriots named Tom Brady and I refuse to have him lumped together — by inference — with Philip Rivers, Drew Brees and other second bananas in the league. For starters, Rodgers was voted as last season’s Most Valuable Player, but I didn’t see him on the field when the Patriots won the Super Bowl. Brady was there, as he has been six times, four of them as the winner. I know, I know, the voting for the MVP takes place before the playoffs, which may explain why Peyton has won five MVPs and only one Super Bowl. And I realize that Rodgers was playing hurt when Green Bay lost to Seattle in the NFC Championship game. As a matter of fact, in Brady’s four Super Bowl victories, he was never voted the MVP for that season’s performance. The misguided gentlemen (and women) who do the voting are probably consumed with stats, like yards gained passing, number of completions and, most persuasive of all, touchdown passes. If all there was to being named the MVP was to rack up touchdown passes, Brady could easily have had four or five against Jacksonville two weeks ago. In their 51-17 victory against the Jaguars, LeGarrette Blount scored three touchdowns from in close. Instead Brady could have thrown short passes for touchdowns. Brady has taken the Patriots to six Super Bowls in 14 seasons. Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers have won two combined, half as many as Brady. And yet they have been voted MVP a total of seven times to Brady’s twice. Something’s out of whack and at the risk of sounding paranoid, I think it’s prejudice. The New England Patriots have become the Evil Empire of the National Football League. On one level it’s because they are so successful, just like the New York Yankees were from Babe Ruth to Mickey Mantle. That much is understandable. But there is a darker reason. Almost every football fan west of Foxboro thinks of the Patriots as cheaters. In 2007 New England was caught videotaping the New York Jets’ defensive signals and was disciplined. In the never-ending brouhaha about footballs the Patriots were accused of deflating in last year’s game against Indianapolis, many folks chose to believe the Patriots were at it again, trying to get an edge. OK, it’s a free country, fans can think what they want. But what about the owners of NFL teams? I have no way of knowing for sure, but there is a strong suspicion that a large group of them muscled Goodell to find Brady guilty and punish him accordingly. And indeed, Goodell is challenging Judge Richard Berman’s finding as I write. It’s hard to imagine a different outcome, but it’s possible. Which leads us back to the Patriots. They have won their first three games and Brady has never looked better. Take that, Rex Ryan. Someone accused them of running up the score — 51-17 — on Jacksonville. Is it possible the Jaguar owner, Shahid Khan, was one of those who wanted Brady suspended? And who distrusts Coach Bill Belichick? Jerry Jones owns the Dallas Cowboys. This Sunday the Patriots go there. For his sake, let’s pray Jones isn’t on the Patriots’ enemies list. Walter Bingham, a former editor and writer for Sports Illustrated, lives in Truro.
