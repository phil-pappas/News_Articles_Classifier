The outspoken Australian fired 13 aces and saved all five break points in a 6-3 6-2 win over his Austrian opponent. Slovak Martin Klizan beat local favourite Zhang Ze 7-6(8) 6-2 and now runs into top seed Novak Djokovic who is gunning for his ninth title of the year. Croatia’s Ivo Karlovic, who prevailed 6-4 7-6(6) over Frenchman Jeremy Chardy, also faces a formidable second round opponent in 2009 runner-up Rafa Nadal who lost to Djokovic in Sunday’s China Open final. American John Isner burnished his big-serving reputation with 20 aces in a 6-1 6-2 romp against Adrian Mannarino. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:11:34.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
