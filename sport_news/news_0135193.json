A failed 2-point conversion — well…Russellville (2-5, 1-3 7A/6A-Central Conference) quarterback Cale Fulsom took the snap, rolled to the right and found Jackson Hickey in the front corner of the end zone to give Russellville a 32-31 victory.“We were playing to win,” Dawson said. “We weren't playing not to lose. We have been on the losing side of three close games. I thought it was in our mentality.“We weren't trying to win. We were hoping to win. That's why we went for two.”Van Buren (2-5, 0-3) moved the ball 68 yards in seven plays for a touchdown on its opening drive. The Pointers crossed the goal line on a 19-yard pass from Jordan Barlow to Zach Wornkey to make it 7-0 after the PAT kick with 9:31 still left in the first quarter.The Cyclones responded with a speedy, no-huddle spree to the end zone. Fulsom connected on five consecutive passes, the final a 23-yard pass to Caleb Stokes for a touchdown.Fulsom stayed perfect through the air throughout the next Russellville series, which came quick after an interception by Cyclones defensive back Ryan Talley. Fulsom connected with Steven Baty, Ryan Meador and Stokes on five more on-target passes.Hickey tore off 22 yards on three rushes to help set up Fulsom's 14-yard touchdown strike to Stokes to put Russellville up 14-7 with 2:03 left in the first quarter.The Cyclones held the Pointers to a field goal on the next drive to make it 14-10, but Van Buren took a 17-14 hafltime lead after forcing Russellville to punt late in the second quarter. The snap flew over the deep kicker's head and was downed on the Cyclones 29-yard line. Two plays later, Barlow escaped up the gut for a 16-yard touchdown.Russellville scored on its opening possession of the second half. The Cyclones moved the ball 65 yards in eight plays. Cole McKown tore the final 38 yards to put Russellville up 21-17 with 8:53 left in the third quarter.Nate Turner later added a 26-yard field goal with 20 seconds left in the third quarter to make it 24-17. The Pointers tied the score with 8:05 left in the fourth quarter when Barlow found Wornkey for an 81-yard touchdown pass.Fulsom finished the night 20-of-35 for 210 yards and three touchdowns.“I'm proud of all of them,” Dawson said. “Fulsom had a huge night. Our offensive line played much better. Meador played great with big catches. I'm just proud of all of them.“This win was big if nothing else for our mentality. They kept putting themselves in positions to be successful. We knew that sooner or later, it was going to pay off.”Russellville hosts Alma on Friday.
