There wasn't a balance. Strong Christian, strong Catholic, and not a balance at home. I want to make sure my wife and kids know who I am.\"\nHis backstory is not unlike many others immersed in this sport. He started playing in fourth grade. He religiously attended Toledo Central Catholic High School football games, earned the nickname \"demolition\" by a sports writer for a local paper when he played there and still receives score updates from his parents on Friday nights.\nHe walked on at Bowling Green before transferring to Division III Wittenberg. Within days of playing his final game, he assisted his college program before becoming a graduate assistant under Shafer at Northern Illinois.\nIt was the first job that ultimately led him to Syracuse, and there is a good chance Daoust's career has not peaked. The 37-year-old has been linked to openings each of the last two offseasons, some he's called \"comical.\" But there once was the prospect that Daoust may have been on the opposing sideline when the Pittsburgh Panthers visit the Carrier Dome for Saturday's ACC matchup.\nDaoust was interested in being Pat Narduzzi's defensive coordinator. The two previously worked together at Northern Illinois and Cincinnati, and Narduzzi and Shafer are in many ways carbon-copies.\nThe Pitt coach said the two spoke about the defensive coordinator job in the offseason when he was assembling his staff.\nNo offer was made.\n\"It's tough when you put your first staff together,\" Narduzzi said in the summer. \"I have a lot of respect for Tim. He's a great coach, great person. His wife's dad was my family dentist. It's all good people. You just try to evaluate, and you're looking for the fit. Tim would've fit in.\" Narduzzi hired Josh Conklin from Florida International.\nDaoust seems at peace with that decision, and there is some level of comfort that his opportunity could very well come at Syracuse after Shafer strongly suggested this summer he would be named defensive coordinator if Chuck Bullough ever moved on.\nWhen discussing the likelihood more schools could court him, Daoust was firm in his commitment to Syracuse, and much of it traces back to two of the coaches he admires most: Shafer and Joe Fincham, his college coach at Wittenberg and a former college teammate of Shafer's at Ohio.\nDaoust saw Shafer's short tenure at Michigan as proof people mattered. He recognized Fincham remained at Division III Wittenberg despite numerous conference championships because of a desire to not move his family around. When Fincham agreed to an interview with a reporter, he requested Wednesday, a day he knew his mornings would have some free time because it is the one time each week he carves out time to drive his kids to school.\n\"There have been opportunities out there for me that if I wanted the title just to be a defensive coordinator, could have been accomplished if I wanted to put that on my list,\" Daoust said.\n\"But the right situation to me has to be the right people. I like it here. I like working for Coach Bullough. I like working for Coach Shafer. I'm not going to go chance my family and my career for an unknown.\n\"I'm not going anywhere. It's comical at times, things that were out there and not true. I'm in a very good situation, and I mean that and believe that, and I don't want anyone to misconstrue anything. I like it here and want to be here.\"\nWhat does he tell recruits?\n\"I'm not going anywhere. Coach (Shafer) is my best friend, for crying out loud. At the end of the day, it's people, people, people. I'm not going to put things to chance that I don't have to. I'm not doing it.\"\nFor all four years?\n\"Yeah. I can honestly tell recruits that. I'm linked to Scott Shafer, and I'm good with that. I'm good with that.\n\"It feels good to be wanted right here. Let's not kid ourselves. We won three games last year. It wasn't like people are falling over themselves to go get the defensive line coach for a three-win football team, you know what I mean? Saturdays were pretty humbling last year. There's a lot to be done right here.\"\nThat now includes trying to right a defense that has gotten shredded the last three games. Before the triple-overtime loss to Virginia, Daoust called the defense's performance \"unacceptable,\" emblematic of the high standard he holds the unit to, regardless of the litany of youth scattered around the field, his relentless pursuit of excellence — Ron Thompson can attest to that .\nThat, too, can be traced to Fincham, who once was searching for leadership to emerge after a loss, reamed Daoust out in a team meeting, and \"he responded as well as I could ever hope for,\" Fincham said.\nDaoust spent part of the bye week driving from Syracuse to Ohio to visit with friends and family. He stopped by Wittenberg to watch his younger sister-in-law play volleyball, and his daughter kicked off her shoes, removed her tiny socks and lounged out on the couch in Fincham's office when he went to meet his old coach.\n\"The extended family he built through Wittenberg and (his wife) are just as important as his bloodline,\" said Matt Leisure, Daoust's college roommate.\n\"He knows that loyalty means a lot and is going to take him farther than trying to jump job to job or try to achieve a different title at a different school. He definitely wants to be a higher-level coach and do those things, but he's going to do it the right way that suits him and wait for the right fit.\"\nTheir college coach believes \"a good job is not about the money. It's not about the title. It's not about the size of the house you're going to live in.\"\nA lot of time, he says, is spent with a football staff, so you better be able to trust and enjoy that time.\n\"I'm always about people. I try to work for good people, if at all possible,\" Daoust said. \"If I can control it, I want to work for a good person who has like values to me. I've taken and not taken jobs on that premise alone, right there, and I work for a great person. That's huge. That's how I make my decisions.\"\nContact Nate Mink anytime: 315-430-8253 | Email | Twitter | Facebook | Google+", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/101909902589503702259/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/nate.mink.1", "https://twitter.com/MinkNate"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:43:57.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
