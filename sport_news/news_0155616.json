(Photo: Max Ortiz, Detroit News) \nFlint -- Five-star forward Miles Bridges decided to go green. \nThe 6-foot-7 basketball star announced Saturday at Mott Community College in his hometown of Flint that he would attend Michigan State, selecting the Spartans over his other finalists, Kentucky and Indiana. \nBridges, who plays for Huntington (W.Va.) Prep, is rated the No. 4 small foward in the nation by Scout.com and the No. 11 player overall. \n\"I can't wait to get started,\" Bridges said Saturday about playing at MSU. \nBridges adds to MSU's impressive 2016 recruiting class that also includes 6-6 guard Josh Langford of Madison, Ala., a five-star prospect and consensus top-20 player in the nation; Cassius Winston, a 6-1, four-star point guard from U-D Jesuit; and 6-9 forward Nick Ward, a four-star and consensus top-50 player from Gahanna, Ohio. \nWinston's decision to attend MSU weighed heavily in Bridges' mind. \n\"Cassius is my boy and I actually thought he was going to Michigan,\" Bridges said Saturday after picking the Spartans. \"I wanted to play with Cassius.\" \nMiles reached down at the table he was sitting at and put on a Michigan State hat before making his announcement. \n\"I'm glad it's over,\" Bridges said. \"its been very exciting. Michigan State coaches did an amazing job recruiting me since my eighth grade year. The coaches were awesome.\" \nMiles said he picked the Spartans \"to win games and to win a national championship. That''s all I want to do.\" \n\"Certainly, coming out of the summer most everyone thought Kentucky was the team to beat,\" Scout.com analyst Brian Snow told The Detroit News this week. \"Even about a month ago somebody close to Miles told me, 'Miles' school is blue,' meaning Kentucky. So clearly Kentucky had some momentum there and most people thought they were the team to beat. \n\"But at the same time no one was really counting Michigan State out, and Tom Izzo is not someone you count out with a kid that is born and raised in Flint.\" \nSnow described Miles' game: \n\"He's strong. He's a freak athlete. He's shooting the ball better than ever. So he does a lot of different things. He does nothing great, per se, but just has such a good ability to rebound, such a good ability to attack the rim.\" <!--iframe--> 70 CONNECT 47 TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1LabglP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:38:27.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
