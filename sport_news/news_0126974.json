(Kevin Richardson) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Carroll County Times Interim coach Mike Locksley wants Terps to play football \"in its purest form.\" \nWhen Mike Locksley takes the field as Maryland's interim coach against Penn State on Saturday, he's not worried about getting butterflies or having any nerves in his first game as a team's head coach since 2011. He's just expecting to have \"that rock-gut feeling\" with all of the scenarios for the afternoon flashing through his mind. \nMost of all, Locksley's excited to be back on the field after two whirlwind weeks and to have the opportunity to be back with the Terps for a game in which they're trying to end a three-game losing streak. \nFor Locksley, that's where the emphasis is going to lie for the final six games of the season: with the players. Days after he was named interim coach and athletic director Kevin Anderson said he expects the offensive coordinator to be a candidate to remain coach, Locksley said he had \"zero expectations\" of earning the job. And with an uncertain future for the program, Locksley said he's not going to be preoccupied with how things will shake out on that front. \n\"I really am not going to concern myself with auditioning for a head coaching job,\" Locksley said Tuesday. \"I won't politic for it. I think my only mission and my only job is to make sure that these kids, especially the seniors, have an opportunity to go out and be as competitive as they can be the next six weeks, to go out and have as much fun, to play the game with as much passion as they can.\" \nIn the aftermath of Randy Edsall's firing on Oct. 11, Locksley talked about getting the players in touch with their feelings about the previous few weeks. He didn't want any players to feel like they were at fault for Edsall losing his job, and as the season continues, Locksley doesn't want the Terps to feel like they're playing for anyone's job or future. It's an intuitive bit of psychology from Locksley, who is tasked with trying to get a team that has lost three straight games by at least 21 points to turn the page.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:43:47.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
