Riot police used tear gas and water cannon against a group of migrants pelting them with rocks.\nThe church said any criticism of Hungary for protecting its borders was \"unfounded and unacceptable.\"\n\"We are aware that most migrants arrive from countries which are open enemies of Jesus Christ and Christianity and in which Christians are persecuted for their faith,\" the statement said.\n\"Those who come here may not have participated in this actively, but it is enough if they agreed with the persecution or did not raise their voice against it, while coming here they demand their human rights to be observed.\"\nThe church added that it was providing help for migrants in the name of brotherly love, and praised the work of the Hungarian Reformed charity and refugee mission.\nHungary is also now sealing its frontier with Croatia to cut off an alternative corridor for migrants trying to enter the EU's Schengen passport-free travel zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:40:09.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
