Despite the tight schedule, weekly tackling and pursuit drills are a staple in Ball State practices. The basics are not overlooked. \n“Even once the season starts, we work on fundamentals,” said head coach Pete Lembo. “We always work on it.” \nSince it’s always a focal point, there won’t be any more emphasis on tackling this week than in any other. Not even after allowing 280 rushing yards in a 24-10 loss to Toledo last weekend. \nAn eight-play, 68-yard scoring drive riddled with missed tackles gave Toledo a 14-0 advantage in the second quarter when momentum really started to shift in the Rockets’ favor. Seven of those eight plays were runs, and three of those gained more than 10 yards. \n“There were a lot of opportunities for a run to be a three-yard run that turned into seven or eight yards,” Lembo said. “That really hurt us.” \nMissed tackles hurt, but some bigger concerns include making sure players are fitting the right gaps. As Lembo puts it, “tackling is one part of it. The other part of it is how you get to that point.” \nSenior linebacker Zack Ryan said Ball State “learned a lot” in the Toledo game. As far as the tackling part goes, one lesson was not to over-pursue on defense. \n“A bunch of us are trying to take that kill shot, but what you need to do is shimmying, which is breaking down, so they can’t cross your face really easily,” Ryan said. “That’s something we’ve really got to clean up, is our tackling.” \nThere were lessons in the “getting there” part, too. \nThe Rockets ran a lot of motion players across the line of scrimmage before snapping the ball, which makes it tricky to always be ready for the play, Ryan said. As a linebacker, it’s easy to miss the snap when watching someone move across the line. And falling behind even by a single step can throw off an entire defensive play. \nSince Toledo and Northern Illinois run a lot of similar plays, Ryan said he’ll be a bit more prepared when the teams play at 3:30 p.m. Saturday in DeKalb, Illinois. He’s also already played against Northern Illinois twice in his career — with double-digit tackles in both games — so he knows, to some extent, what to expect against the Huskies. \nNorthern Illinois (2-3, 0-1 Mid-American Conference) has played a relatively tough schedule, with games against No. 1 Ohio State and Boston College. Through five games, the Huskies have put up 832 rushing yards on 218 attempts. That's only about 3.8 yards per carry, but they've run the ball at least 30 times in every game, including a season-high 59 times last week against Central Michigan. \nRyan said he's ready to take what the Cardinals (2-3, 1-1) learned in their most recent loss and move on to the Huskies. \n“I’m just really excited,” he said. “I can’t wait to play (Northern Illinois).” \nFollow Ball State sports reporter Dakota Crawford on Twitter @DakotaCrawford_ . 4 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1RwPfyO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:50:37.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
