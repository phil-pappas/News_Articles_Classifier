TOLEDO (13abc Action News) - A mayoral candidate tackles the issue of gun violence in Toledo just days after the city’s latest murder.\nLate Thursday night, Toledo Police officers found nearly three dozen shell casings at a shooting on a driveway on Bush Street near Erie in north Toledo.\nFinkbeiner wants officers to be more aggressive in seeking warrants and weapons, as well as step up traffic stops. But Police Chief George Kral says his department is already doing that and has the data to prove it.\nA few residents lit candles in memory of Toledo's latest murder victim Sunday night.\nOn October 8th, someone fired dozens of rounds at a home across the street from the fire station on Bush and Erie.\n23-year old Jewell Miller was hit and killed.\n\"Yeah it's scary,\" said resident Ron Smith. \"There needs to be more police because too many shootings.\"\n\"Ultimately you want the safest city you can possibly have and we need to improve the status quo,\" said mayoral candidate Carty Finkbeiner.\nToledo’s former mayor says there are too many gang inspired shootings and juveniles with guns. He thinks the current administration needs to implement an initiative like he did when he was mayor and target hot spots and groups of people loitering.\n“I know that TPD, Toledo Police Department is the best trained, best disciplined gang in Toledo and it is time they are asked to be on high alert in the city's most toughest, most violent prone neighborhoods during the hours of peak criminal activity,” said Finkbeiner.\nBut Police Chief George Kral says his department has and continues to direct resources to high crime locations based on criminal intelligence data and crime patterns.\nChief Kral released the latest numbers to 13abc:\nSearch warrants: in 2014, TPD conducted 367.\nThis year, officers have already served 612 search warrants.\nIn regards to confiscated firearms, in 2014, TPD acquired 280 guns off the streets.\nThis year they've already snatched 245 guns and will likely top last year’s number in the months ahead.\nKral says traffic stops are dramatically up as well.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/carty+on+guns.JPG", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D40/022/D40022FA05234C8CAFCE4252915CC9B3.mp4", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/carty+on+guns.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:17:43.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
