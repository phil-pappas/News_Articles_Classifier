Paul Zoeller/Staff/File × When the Charleston Battery pulled out of the parking lot at Slugger Field in late August after a 3-1 loss to Louisville City FC, it looked like a team ready to implode. \nGame Day \nWho: Charleston Battery at Louisville City FC When: Saturday, 7:30 p.m. \nWhere: Slugger Field in Louisville, Ken. \nRegular-season series: Tied, 1-1. The Battery had started out the season with great promise, but by late August were in the midst of a six-match winless streak, limping its way toward the USL postseason. With four games left in the regular season, Charleston Battery coach Mike Anhaeuser knew the club needed a spark. A 2-0 win over arch-rival Richmond a week later and 1-1 draw with Pittsburgh — both matches on the road — finally pulled the Battery out of their funk. Throw in last weekend’s dramatic 2-1 come-from-behind victory over Richmond in the opening round of the playoffs, and the Battery is now one of the hottest teams in the USL. On Saturday, the Battery returns to Slugger Field in Kentucky to take on Louisville City FC in the USL Eastern Conference semifinals. Charleston is 4-0-1 in its last five matches and has allowed just three goals during that stretch. “This is the time of year when you want to be in form, you want to be at your best and I think we’re getting there,” said Charleston captain Jarad van Schaik. “There are still a couple of things we need to clean up, but we’re playing better and better each week. Defensively, we’ve been playing well the last month and now we’ve finally started to put the ball in the back of the net. We’re going to be a very tough team beat.” The Battery allowed just 29 goals during the season — the second lowest goals against total in the league. “Defensively, we’ve been very good the last month,” Anhaeuser said. “We’ve been able to keep our shape. Our communication has been very good and the guys really deserve the credit. They’ve taken pride in what they’re doing.” An energized Dane Kelly has also helped. Kelly, the USL’s all-time leading goal scorer, slumped in the middle of the season and has now returned to form, scoring in each of the last three matches. Kelly scored the tying goal in overtime last week against the Kickers. “I feel good, I’m confident,” Kelly said. “When I wasn’t scoring earlier in the season I was very frustrated, but I worked on my game and now I’m scoring again.” Stopping Louisville City means limiting striker Matt Fondy, who led the USL with 22 goals during the season. Fondy was held without a shot in the Battery’s 2-0 win over Louisville on Sept. 12. Fondy had two goals in Louisville’s 3-1 win at Slugger Field on Aug. 22. “We’re going to talk about the same things that we compensated for after the first match,” Anhaeuser said. “Fondy got us twice up there, so it’s really about shutting him down. If he gets a goal, it gets them going, it gets the fans going. We need to play our game, we need to attack and put them under pressure, too, because that can cause them some problems.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:15:09.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
