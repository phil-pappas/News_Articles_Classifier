This [the west] is a paradise; it is a heaven,” she said. “He is a criminal, he is killing millions there, I hope we see him as not a joke.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yeonmi Park speaks to BBC correspondent Lyse Doucet, during the Women in the World summit.

My mother told me not to whisper because the birds and mice might hear you,” she said.\n“Most of all we are hungry, we don’t have the luxury of [thinking about] anything else apart from surviving,” adding that at one point she and her sister resorted to eating grasshoppers and dragon flies because there was no more rice.\nRelated: How the China model could help North Korea – and save Kim Jong-un\nWhen she was 13 she urged her mother to flee to China, after secretly watching Chinese television as a child. “I went for a bowl of rice,” she said. She told the audience that the first thing she saw was her mother being raped. Once in the country, she was sold as a worker for $260; her mother was sold for $65.\n“The man who bought me couldn’t feed us, so it was better to sell her to someone who could feed her,” she said.\nAge of 15 she crossed the Gobi desert into Mongolia, to reach South Korea. “I followed the northern stars to freedom,” she said. In a rare light moment she described being bewildered by escalators, not understanding why the ground was moving. “When I arrived, everything was shining,” she said. “I went to the toilet and the toilet paper had a flower on it, it smelt so good I thought I’m not going to use it for this reason. It was so pretty.”\nRelated: North Korea prepares for lavish birthday party – in pictures\nShe then became a “learning machine”, she added. “I learnt about the universe. I learnt about human rights and human dignity – this was so new to me. Freedom meant for me to wear earrings, not freedom of speech. I don’t think I will ever understand what freedom means, but I am enjoying learning.”", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dc91c439ce94386b4a8be1871ae399d63ab19ae/773_133_4137_3308/master/4137.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=042b40749ec819b909081928adea8a70", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Kim+Jong-un+is+no+joke%2C+says+North+Korean+defector&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Foct%2F11%2Fkim-jong-un-north-korea-yeonmi-park&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F5dc91c439ce94386b4a8be1871ae399d63ab19ae%2F773_133_4137_3308%2F4137.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dc91c439ce94386b4a8be1871ae399d63ab19ae/773_133_4137_3308/master/4137.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=1f44d722fd886a36724e3d243ef88de2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dc91c439ce94386b4a8be1871ae399d63ab19ae/773_133_4137_3308/master/4137.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=b7457bb23d92266137e7f008e4e1781d", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d7f7%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d7f7&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F5dc91c439ce94386b4a8be1871ae399d63ab19ae%2F773_133_4137_3308%2F4137.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kim%20Jong-un%20is%20no%20joke%2C%20says%20North%20Korean%20defector&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d7f7%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dc91c439ce94386b4a8be1871ae399d63ab19ae/773_133_4137_3308/master/4137.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0d0bb36929f4cee1ae5a8535f6dae06a"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:50:56.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
