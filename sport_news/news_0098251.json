Matt Doherty of Wolverhampton Wanderers and Troy Deeney of Watford. \n“I thought Walsall would get rid of me but they had patience,” he said. “Initially, I still wasn’t switched on. But I’d been going to work, going in at six in the morning and coming home at eight at night. When I had a chance to get up at nine, back home for two, I wanted some of that. \n“The other lads would say to me after training, ‘I’m so tired’. I’d be sitting there going, ‘you lot for real?’ I thought I’ll make more money for less work, let’s not blow this.” \nThe striker went on to score 27 goals in 123 appearances for the Saddlers before earning a £500,000 move to Watford – a deal which could still net Walsall a large sell-on fee. \nBut in December 2012, eight days after his father died from cancer, Deeney was convicted of affray for his part in a street brawl in Birmingham. \nHe served three months in prison. But the 27-year-old says time in jail helped turn his life around. \n“At that point I was still one of the lads,” Deeney admitted. “I was going out drinking but because I was still performing on a Saturday nobody told me to stop. \n“Then reality kicked in. I went to jail for 12 weeks, I had 300 people in my phone book, but only six people sent me letters and helped with my bills. \n“On a Saturday I had hundreds of people wanting to go out with me. \n“But when I was in prison and not being paid, there weren’t many people saying ‘here’s that £100 you sorted me out with’. I came out and it was a second chance – my mentality was that I wanted to make my son proud because he thought I was at a football camp.” \nA character reformed, Deeney is Watford captain and would command a transfer fee in excess of £10 million.
