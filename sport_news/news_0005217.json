It is not the settlements, it is not the peace process, it is the desire to destroy the state of Israel pure and simple.\"\nBan also acknowledged the security challenges facing Israel in the face of a wave of Palestinian knife, gun and car attacks, while condemning militant groups who have expressed support for them.\n\"Over the past weeks I have been deeply troubled by statements from Palestinian militant groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad praising such heinous attacks,\" he said.\nEight Israelis have been killed in protests that began at the start of the month.
