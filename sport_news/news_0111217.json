The hosts led 8-0 after the two-point conversion. \nOceanside responded quickly when DeBrosky hooked up with Sprague on a 49-yard scoring pass and found itself down 8-7, but MDI scored the game's next 28 points as the hosts marched to their sixth win. \nDeBrosky cashed in on a run from three yards out in the fourth quarter to round out the Oceanside scoring. \nOceanside will host Belfast in its regular-season finale, while MDI could clinch one of the top two seeds in Class C North with a win over unbeaten Old Town. Both games are Friday, Oct. 23 at 7 p.m. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Crabtree Point Standings for Class C North, Oceanside (3-4, 94.6857 points) is seventh, while Old Town (7-0, 137.5000 points) is first in the 10-team region.
