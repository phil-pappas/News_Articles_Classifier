Like I’ve said before, they’re on the improve,\" he said. \n\"The goal will be for them to play to get out on the paddock today and have a bit of a run around, finish the full session and see how they go.\" \nSio is more doubtful. The loosehead prop, who has played a big role in improving Australia's scrum, started against the Scots but left the field early with a badly swollen elbow. \n\"He ran a little bit the other day. It all depends on how much the swelling comes down in his elbow,\" Cheika said. \n\"Obviously it’s important for him for scrummaging in particular so that will be the main issue there.\" \nJames Slipper is the most likely replacement for Sio if he is not passed fit. \nBen McCalman, who started at the back of the scrum last week, would keep his place if Pocock was ruled out with Kurtley Beale likely to continue at fullback if Folau is not fit. \n(Reporting by Julian Linden.
