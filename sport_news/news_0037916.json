Inevitably, at some stage it will start dimming and it's the sign of a wise athlete to know when the moment has come to turn it off,\" Basso was Quote: d as saying in a statement from his Tinkoff-Saxo team, where he will retain a \"managerial role\".\nBasso looked on course for Tour glory when he won the white jersey for the best Under-25 rider in 2002, in an era dominated by the disgraced Lance Armstrong, a testicular cancer survivor.\nBasso never won the world's greatest race, however, finishing third and second overall in 2004 and 2005 respectively.\nBasso won the Giro twice -- his only grand tour titles -- thanks to impressive climbing performances.\nHis career, however, was stained with a two-year ban for his implication in the Operation Puerto blood-doping scandal.\nBasso admitted to \"attempted doping\" in 2007 and was hit by a backdated two-year suspension which ended in October 2008.\nHe won the Giro less than two years after his comeback from suspension.\nHe was one of Alberto Contador's lieutenants on this year's Tour de France having helped the Spaniard win the Giro in May.\nBut Basso quit the Tour de France on the first rest day having just been diagnosed with testicular cancer. He was declared cancer free on Sept. 24.\n(Reporting by Julien Pretot,; Editing by Pritha Sarkar )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:31:08.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
