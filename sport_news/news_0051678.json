Weeks like that will have you questioning yourself. It’s hard to call a game in Week 6 a must-win for either NC State or Duke, but it sure feels that way for both. NC State’s challenge will obviously be much steeper than Duke’s against Army, but both really need this one for different reasons. \nClemson and FSU face must-wins as well, both against rivals that have traditionally been pesky even when they’re not at their best. And Pitt has been the surprise team of the ACC so far, but they’ll have to prove they’ve overcome their own Pitt-ness against Virginia. \nAll of that, of course, is burying the lead – we get #therivalry this weekend, after much ballyhoo and anticipation. Finally, Boston College and Wake Forest – both coming off of tough losses – will give us the matchup we’ve always wanted. \nFRIDAY \nNC STATE (4-1, 0-1 ACC) AT VIRGINIA TECH (2-3, 0-1 ACC) \nTime: 8:00 p.m. TV: ESPN \n#ANALYSIS \nTHE AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT BOWL! Kinda. It’s really more like the Avoid Panic Bowl. Neither of these teams are what I thought they would be at the beginning of the year. As well as NC State’s defense played against its early-season competition, the Wolfpack still let up big plays. And they did that again last week against Louisville. Virginia Tech’s offense is a hot, steaming mess that gets more gross by the week. SEVEN SACKS?! A HUNDRED YARDS OF TOTAL OFFENSE AGAINST PITT?! But what’s confounding about the Hokies’ offense is that they have shown signs of life, and even significant improvement from last season. But it hasn’t sustained itself. So this game is going to come down to NC State’s defense and how effectively it can keep contain on a mobile QB (assuming Brenden Motley goes over the suddenly-healed and less-mobile Michael Brewer). If they let the Hokie offense get going, they’re in big, big trouble. \nTHIS GUY \nJacoby Brissett. There are a lot of x-factors for NC State on offense that help it run when it’s going well. And it certainly wasn’t Brissett’s fault that the offense struggled early against Louisville – not entirely, anyway. But later in the game, he played worse– part of the accumulation of hits– and he completed just 2-of-6 passes for 18 yards and was sacked twice (plus ran it three times for no yards). That’s a lot of hits, and in the game he was sacked four times. NC State is going to be facing a Virginia Tech defense that isn’t what it has been and has allowed big plays, but has shown what it can do. It will look to confuse and fluster him – oh, and hit him. A lot. He’ll have to persevere through it and make good choices. \nHERE’S A GUY \nBrenden Motley. Look, I know what Virginia Tech is saying. Michael Brewer is healthy again, just four weeks after breaking his collarbone against Ohio State. But behind that porous Hokie o-line, Virginia Tech may need someone who can run around. And Motley can do that. He completed just 9-of-20 passes in the loss to Pitt last week and ran it for just -14 yards on 17 attempts (seven of those were sacks for -57 yards, so 10 for 43). He had 19 carries for 85 yards the game before, and considering what Louisville freshman QB Lamar Jackson did – 19 rushes for 121 yards on the Wolfpack – Motley could be more of a matchup problem than Brewer anyway. \nNARRATIVES \nNC State Win: Maybe NC State can open the door that was left ajar after all \nNC State Loss: I guess you weren’t ready for your moment in the Friday night spotlight \nVirginia Tech Win: So is that…..good, or…. \nVirginia Tech Loss: Well, Frank Beamer, I think your seat just got hot. Or HOTTER, even. \nPREDICTION \nVirginia Tech, 29-22. I get like every Virginia Tech game wrong ever, so you’re welcome in advance, NC State fans. \nSATURDAY \nDUKE (4-1, 2-0 ACC) AT ARMY (1-4) \nTime: 12:00 p.m. TV: CBSSN \n#ANALYSIS \nLet’s get this out of the way: Army is really bad. Against UConn, Wake and Penn State, the Black Knights combined for 45 points. I’ll give them this – their defense isn’t allowing ton of points. Problem is, it’s still allowing 6.13 yards per play. That’s 107th nationally. A step up from being one of the nation’s worst defenses last year, but hey. The triple option attack can be tough to defend, but Duke’s already done it once this year. Duke’s offense showed signs of improvement last week but it’s going to have to get it together in a hurry. If Duke can’t move the ball more efficiently against Army than it has in the last few weeks, that’s not a very good sign for its Coastal hopes. And the Blue Devils really need to run the ball. Army is allowing 4.15 yards per carry, 65th nationally. Time to get physical, Duke o-line. \nIt’s also worth noting that Phil Jackson spoke to Army’s football team last week. Army lost just 20-14 to Penn State. Phil may be the Zen master, but forgive me if I’m not too high on his motivational ability lately. \nTHIS GUY \nJela Duncan. He made his return to the lineup after missing all of 2014 against Georgia Tech, getting four carries for 23 yards (5.75 per) and followed it up last week with four for 13 against the nation’s No. 1 rush defense. He also had one catch in each game, including an 18-yarder against Boston College. Right now, three Blue Devils (Shaq Powell, Shaun Wilson and QB Thomas Sirk) have almost all of Duke’s rushing attempts, and Duke has averaged a rather pedestrian 4.06 yards per rush. Duncan showed in his first two years at Duke that he is a playmaker, and the Blue Devils need someone who can get the running game going. Maybe he’s ready to churn out some tough yards. \nHERE’S A GUY \nAndrew King. One reason Army’s defense is no longer a smoldering dumpster fire is the junior linebacker, who is second nationally in tackles for loss with 10.0 on the season (including 4.0 sacks). He’s also second on the team in total tackles with 38. He also has two fumble recoveries. Duke is no doubt going to try to reestablish its running game, and King – who had 2.0 tackles for loss and a sack in the narrow loss to Penn State and racked up 4.5 FL and three sacks against UConn – is going to look to prevent that from happening. \nNARRATIVES \nDuke Win: Between last week and this week, watching Duke games like \nDuke Loss: OH MY GOD DUKE CAN WE TRUST NO ONE IN THIS LEAGUE \nPREDICTION \nDuke, 30-17. This one will be gross. \nVIRGINIA (1-3) AT PITTSBURGH (3-1, 1-0 ACC) \nTime: 12:30 p.m. TV: ACC Network \n#ANALYSIS \nGood news/bad news, Pitt. I picked you to lose fairly handily last week, and you won fairly handily instead. Bad news is I took you in my ACC Survivor pool this week. When Pitt joined the ACC a few years ago, didn’t take me long to learn that anytime you think Pitt is going to do one thing, it tends to do the opposite. Especially if that thing you think it will do is win a football game it is supposed to win. Of course Virginia’s own dumpster fire situation oscillates between raging inferno and just a few lingering flames from seemingly day to day. \nVirginia’s offense has been a mess all year. Pitt’s defense seems to be steadily improving. Let’s see if those trends hold true. \nNARRATIVES \nVirginia Win: Hey maybe this means Virginia is turning things around I can feel the excitement from here \nVirginia Loss: Doesn’t really matter anyway. \nPittsburgh Win: Okay, Pitt. I see you. \nPittsburgh Loss: Lovely of you to show solidarity with your Pittsburgh Pirates. \nPREDICTION \nPittsburgh, 38-31. Because why wouldn’t this game suddenly become a shootout with no indication that it would be that going in? \nWAKE FOREST (2-3, 0-2 ACC) AT BOSTON COLLEGE (3-2, 0-2 ACC) \nTime: 3:00 p.m. TV: RSN \n#ANALYSIS \nTHE RIVALRY ONE ‘0’ MUST GO! And by ‘0’ I mean ACC wins. You throw out the records when these two get together. And their records are already literally a palindrome if you put them next to each other. The symmetry is beautiful. And these Atlantic Division rivals are fairly evenly matched this year: Wake has found some offense, while Boston College’s defense is arguably stiffer than a year ago and its offense is…well, it’s not good. SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE! STRENGTH VS. STRENGTH! I, for one, cannot wait. \nNARRATIVES Wake Forest Win: Well aren’t you just adorable \nWake Forest Loss: Oh, Wake Forest. \nBoston College Win: I mean, good for you? \nBoston College Loss: Last year was fun. This year? Back to being the most forgotten team in the ACC. \nPREDICTION \nBoston College, 17-16. I’ll believe Wake can win a road game against an ACC team when I see it. \nGEORGIA TECH (2-3, 0-2 ACC) AT NO. 6 CLEMSON (4-0, 1-0 ACC) \nTime: 3:30 p.m. TV: ABC/ESPN2 \n#ANALYSIS \nEverything about this game screams Clemson win. But look a little deeper and there are plenty of reasons to hesitate. Georgia Tech is better than its record – how much better, I don’t know, but better – and while Clemson was impressive for three quarters against Notre Dame, the fourth quarter was such a mess in part because the Tigers are perilously thin defensively with all their injuries. For all Georgia Tech’s issues, it is still 9th nationally in time of possession and it’s a tough style to play against. Clemson’s going to have to keep its foot on the pedal on both sides of the ball and hope Georgia Tech doesn’t get it figured out. \nNARRATIVES \nGeorgia Tech Win: OH OKAY NOW YOU WANT TO WIN, NOW, WHEN IT WILL RUIN EVERYTHING FOR THE REST OF THE LEAGUE YOU ARE THE WORST WHY DID I EVER LIKE YOU \nGeorgia Tech Loss: Paul Johnson, right now: \nClemson Win: The analysts were already salivating at the Tigers last week. That will go up a notch. \nClemson Loss: Clemsoning still isn’t a thing anymore but this cat is probably Clemsoning \nPREDICTION \nClemson, 33-27. Think this game will scare the Tigers at least a little bit. \nSYRACUSE (3-1, 1-0 ACC) AT SOUTH FLORIDA (1-3) \nTime: 3:30 p.m. TV: CBSSN \n#ANALYSIS \nGross. Why do you do this, Syracuse? Two of your non-conference games are against teams that either SHOULD beat you (LSU) or very well COULD (USF). And this is on the road! Syracuse has had a week off after trying in vain to stop the one-man wrecking crew that is Leonard Fournette. USF is somehow the favorite according to Las Vegas, even though the Bulls haven’t beaten an FBS team in four tries. They gave opponents a hard time – FSU, Maryland and Memphis – but haven’t cracked 17 points against an FBS team. Syracuse kept it close with LSU in part because of its salty defense, and if QB Eric Dungey comes back, the Orange should be able to find a way in this one. \nBut seriously, stop doing this, Syracuse. \nNARRATIVES \nSyracuse Win: Yeah sorry I’m bored \nSyracuse Loss: This is what it’s like to watch Syracuse under Scott Shafer, in one GIF: \nPREDICTION \nSyracuse, 27-19. I just am not seeing what Vegas sees here. \nMIAMI (3-1) AT NO. 12 FLORIDA STATE (4-0, 2-0 ACC) \nTime: 8:00 p.m. TV: ABC \n#ANALYSIS \nUncle Luke thinks Miami has totally got this game. But in the past, what Miami has done is played reasonably well against Florida State only to fall flat on their faces after expending that effort. Miami went into the FSU game the last two years with a record of 7-0 and then 6-3 only to go 0-3 and 2-3 in its remaining games. But this isn’t last year’s FSU, and it certainly isn’t the year before’s version. Miami is probably not as bad as it played at Cincinnati and has the talent to compete in this game against a somewhat-shaky FSU squad. \nStat to watch here is third down: Miami is 127th in that category (13-of-53) and that’s after putting up a season-best number vs. an FBS team (27.3%) against Cincinnati. Miami started last season converting 15-of-63 third downs in its first six games before improving steadily and – you guessed it – converting a season-best 55.6% in its near-win against FSU. That was its highest percentage in any game since 2013. FSU has some issues to work out but the offense is starting to click a bit. The defense held its first three opponents to 9-of-45 on third down and allowed Wake to convert 7-of-15. That can’t be a trend that continues. FSU has run just 254 plays this year and two of its opponents have run 75 or more. \nNARRATIVES \nMiami Win: Losing to Cincinnati and then beating one of the two best teams in the league is EXACTLY why no one likes you \nMiami Loss: Even Al Golden has to be tired of being the head coach at Miami at this point. \nFlorida State Win: I’m sure your fans won’t take this win for granted at all and won’t have anything to nitpick \nFlorida State Loss: That’s what happens when you live dangerously \nPREDICTION \nFlorida State, 37-24. Goodnight, sweet Albert Golden. \nOverall: 43-12 (5-4 ACC) \nLast week: 2-5 (2-3 ACC) Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:56:46.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
