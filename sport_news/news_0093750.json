The Colonels will also face traditional power Memphis in their pre-Southland schedule, as well as trips to San Diego and Hawaii. \n“As usual, we have a very, very tough pre-conference schedule,” Colonels coach J.P. Piper said. “Hopefully that prepares us for the rigors of the Southland Conference. That’s always the mindset when we put the schedule together.” \nThe Colonels will collect frequent flyer miles in the first month and a half of the season. Nicholls will open the season with two out of its first three games at home – tilts with Arkansas-Monticello and Mobile on Nov. 9 and Nov. 19, respectively. \nIn between those games, the Colonels will travel to play Florida State on Nov. 15 – one of the most challenging games on the schedule. The Seminoles are one of the preseason favorites to win the Atlantic Coast Conference after returning almost everyone off last year’s 17-win team. \nAfter the Mobile game, the Colonels will head to the West Coast and beyond. Nicholls will face Hawaii on Nov. 23 before returning to the mainland and playing at New Mexico on Nov. 25. \nThe Colonels return home for final exams in early December, but will be quick to hit the road again. After a short two-game homestand, Nicholls will hop on a plane again and will face San Diego State, North Texas, SMU and Colorado in a nine-day span from Dec. 10-18. \nFrom there, the Colonels will play a pre-Christmas tournament in Las Vegas from Dec. 22-23. \nThe Colonels will face Houston on Dec. 28 before opening Southland play on Jan. 2 at home against Lamar. After that first league game, Nicholls will be back on the road again against Memphis on Jan. 5. \nPiper said he’s excited about the schedule, because it will take his veteran team to some of the most hostile environments in the country. He added that it’ll also be good to experience some of the most well-known cities in the world with the team. \n“It’s a schedule that’s taking us all over the country and will give us an opportunity to see a lot of different cities in the preseason,” Piper said. “We’ll play against some really good programs. … There’s some fun stuff in there for the guys, but also some very good basketball teams (for us to face). Some of these teams we’re facing will be ranked in the preseason, I’m certain.” \nThe travel-happy slate is one that Piper hopes his team can overcome. Truth is, this is the most veteran Colonels squad in several seasons. \nThe Nicholls roster is massive for the 2015-16 season, and a lot of decisions will have to be made regarding playing time and the team’s depth chart. \nThe Colonels return all five starters and 10 lettermen off last year’s team that was the No. 6 seed in the Southland Conference Tournament. \nBut Nicholls also blends that deep pool of returnees with nine newcomers, including seven transfer players who joined the roster in the offseason. \nThe Colonels currently have 19 players listed on their roster, which makes this year’s team easily the deepest in the history of Piper’s tenure with the team. \nHe said the numbers are good because they’ll breed competition and allow the Colonels to thrive. \nAmong the top transfers are junior guard Stevie Repichowski, who signed in Thibodaux from Ruston. Another player Piper’s touted throughout the offseason is Boston College transfer and new-Nicholls senior Kyle Caudil – a player who stands 7-feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Those who are familiar with Caudil’s game think he will be a force in the Southland. \nNicholls top returnees include forward Sam McBeath and Thibodaux native Ja’Dante’ Frye. \nPiper said he thinks the Colonels have a chance to do big things. He cited the team’s experience and leadership as key in what he hopes will be a run at the Southland Conference Championship. \n“Last year, we kind of struggled with who we were going to be as a team and our identity and the culture in the locker room,” Piper said. “I think we’ve gotten off to a much better start this year. There’s great buy-in about what we’re going to do and the way we’re going to do things. There’s great leadership early from the older guys. It’s been a real pleasure to coach these guys so far. \n“I’m excited to see what we can get done in the Southland Conference when we get to that part of the schedule.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:24:08.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
