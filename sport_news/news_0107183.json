Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Jamie Benn and Ales Hemsky played in their first preseason game last night as the Dallas Stars took on the St. Louis Blues. Their addition to the lineup wasn’t enough, though, and the Blues walked away with a 4-1 win. Dallas is now 1-4-0 in the preseason.\nMattias Janmark scored the Star’s lone goal at 3:46 in the second period on an odd-man rush from Jason Spezza and Ales Hemsky. From then on, the game belonged to the Blues. Dmitrij Jaskin tied the game halfway through the second, and Vladimir Tarasenko and Scottie Upshall scored later on in the period to take the lead. Troy Brouwer's goal early on in the third period made it a 4-1 game for the Blues. Goaltender Brian Elliot earned St. Louis the win with 25 saves; Antti Niemi stopped 24 for Dallas.\nAfterwards, Coach Lindy Ruff described the game as “disappointing” and pointed to the second half of the game as their downfall. “I was looking at this game to be a good compete game for us. And it was good for thirty minutes, I thought. You know, some of our best players didn’t have a good night. And I thought that hurt us.”\nCaptain Jamie Benn played in his first game since having hip surgery in the offseason. He totaled 17:44 in ice time. “You know, my body felt pretty good, but my game was you know, just okay for now,” said Benn afterwards .\nThe Stars also continued to trim their roster on Monday, sending eight players back to their team or releasing them from tryouts. The cut included Mattias Backman (D), Ludwig Bystrom (D), Mads Eller (F), Julius Honka (D), Stephen Johns (D), Esa Lindell (D), Travis Morin (F) and Devin Shore (F). The Stars roster now stands at 28 players.", "external_links": ["http://video.stars.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=838612&catid=1229", "http://video.stars.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=838599&catid=1229", "http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=780817"], "published": "2015-09-30T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:23:48.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
