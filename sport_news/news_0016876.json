In a statement, Mufti Sayeed expressed grave concern over incidents of mob lynching and said people could not be allowed to take law into their own hands. He added that incidents like Dadri and ink attack on Sudheendra Kulkarni in Mumbai had made people very insecure, which did not augur well for a country that had a proud past of cultural and religious inclusiveness. “The killing of a youth by a mob in Himachal Pradesh is very unfortunate. We can’t allow kangaroo courts to pronounce judgement and lynch people the way they did in Dadri and now in Himachal,” he said, asking the government concerned to enforce rule of law and bring those responsible for such criminal acts to book. Inaugurates ICUs at SKIMS The Chief Minister today inaugurated several wards, ICUs and attendant inns at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) inSrinagar. — TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:09:26.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
