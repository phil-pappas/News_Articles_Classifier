I hope tomorrow's better but the forecast doesn't look any good,\" said Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. \"It's a shame for the people in the grandstands.\"\nFriday's first session was also rain-affected, although drivers did get on track with Germany's Nico Rosberg fastest for Mercedes.\nHis team mate Lewis Hamilton is hoping to clinch his third championship on Sunday with three races to spare. The Briton needs to beat Vettel by nine points and Rosberg by two.\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin , editing by Mark Meadows)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:16:55.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
