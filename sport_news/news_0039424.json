Gilroy is now 2-0 against Christopher this season after beating them 3-1 on Sept. 29. But this time around, the Cougars were much stronger. \n“CHS is tough. They play hard and they had much better passing today—it was hard to defend,” Mustangs coach Adam Gemar said. “(We had) great play from our midfield today.” \nAng Hays returned to Gilroy’s lineup after undergoing microscopic knee surgery. With her return, Gemar said the Mustangs will continue to improve. \n“It was good to have her back. She’s been, in the (past), a huge asset to the team,” he said. “She’ll only help the team the more healthier she gets, the more fit and her attitude is always very positive.” \nStats from Christopher were not immediately available. \nChristopher squared off with Carmel Thursday and headed home with a 5-2 victory. Gilroy, on the other hand, played at Saratoga Friday but lost 3-0. \nGilroy (9-1-2 overall, 4-0 in league) plays Archbishop Mitty at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday at home. \nThe Cougars (7-3 overall, 4-2 in league) will host The York School at 3:30 p.m. Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:29:42.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
