He had another spot-on day, completing 17 of 24 for 321 yards with the long touchdown pass to Brandon Tate during a scramble. \nIt was another rough day all around for Kansas City (1-3). Alex Smith was sacked five times, the Chiefs settled for Cairo Santos' club-record seven field goals, and the defense couldn't keep up with another one of the NFL's top passers.
