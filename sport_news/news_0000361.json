The game will be played Jan. 16, 2016. \nSMG and JAXSPORTS will hold a 5:30 p.m. news conference that will include local players, and a handful from around the state, to officially unveil plans for the game. \nThe Blue-Grey bowl series has three formats. The first (East-West) will be held Dec. 20, 2015 at the Dallas Cowboys AT&T Stadium. The North-South game is Jan. 9, 2016 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay. \nThe game will include players both locally and from out of the area. It marks a major return of high school football all-star activity in the area. The Shrine Bowl was the area's biggest, first being played here in 1949. It moved around the state until returning to the First Coast in 1989. \nThe Shrine Bowl was originally a statewide all-star game, although eventually began failing to draw premier athletes from around Florida as bigger showcase events sprouted up. It shifted to an all-local format in 2001 and played its final game in 2012, due to lack of financial backing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:30:01.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
