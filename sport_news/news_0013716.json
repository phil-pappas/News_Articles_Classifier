Despite seeing her scoring totals drop, Persin has played a big part in the Lions’ success over the last several seasons. \nPersin, who has a modest six goals and seven assists this season, is winding down an outstanding career for the unbeaten Lions, who improved to 17-0 overall and 16-0 in the Colonial League with Wednesday’s 3-1 win over Bangor . \n“Everybody has to make sacrifices for their team,” said Persin, a lehighvalleylive All- Area first team selection last season. “I have a number of different roles, and most of then are defensive roles.” \nMoravian Academy coach Debbie Bross says Persin has the perfect attitude in accepting her role. \nRELATED : Moravian Academy field hockey drawing comparisons to '84 state championship squad \n“She does what she has to do for the team,” Bross said. “She’d never think about saying ‘No, I can’t do that.’ That’s very admirable how she’s bought into it. (Junior defender) Nikki Pearce is the same way.” \nPersin also played forward on her club team. Her adjustment to midfield has perhaps become easier when you consider the Lions’ high rate of success over the years. \n“It was hard at times not being in the spotlight, but it’s really rewarding to be on an undefeated team,” Persin said. “As long as the team is scoring it doesn’t matter to me.” \nPersin’s versatility should also help her at the next level. She plans to play field hockey and study medicine at Dartmouth. \n“I think she’ll do well at Dartmouth,” Bross said. “I’m happy for her.” \nBross describes Persin as someone who leads by example. \n“She’s a quiet leader,” the coach said. “She’s not a rah-rah kid, but she has confidence in herself. She not boastful, but she exudes confidence. You could see when she was out for those two minutes today (while serving a yellow card). We didn’t fall apart, but we really missed her out there.” \nMeanwhile, Persin will continue to contribute to the team in her own quiet way. \n“We have a lot of girls that can score on this team,” Persin said. “We have a very talented forward line. I’m happy to do whatever I can as long as we’re getting the job done.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:53:43.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
