Augusta's girls golf team has been on the short end of close calls in recent years, but this time, at this Regional, the Orioles prevailed. Augusta finished with a team score of 466 to take third place at Monday's Regional meet. The score was three strokes behind Andale's 463. Both teams were way behind the hosting Winfield VIkings, who won the team title with a 396 on their home course. But more importantly for the Orioles, they finished just one little stroke ahead of Andover Central in the standings. Only the top three teams qualify. Kingman was fifth at 500. \"I'm very happy for the girls. They grinded it out on a tough course under difficult conditions,\" coach Keith Conrady said. Difficult is right. As if the course wasn't challenging and lengthy enough, the golfers had to deal with bright, hot conditions that still produced plenty of wind that made even putting difficult. Winfield's Abby Bertholf won the individual title with an 86. Only two other golfers even cracked 100 in the tough conditions. Ashley Roby led the Orioles with a round of 112 to take 12th place overall. Jackie Brandenburg wasn't far behind with a round of 114 to take 14th place. Lyndsey Lewellen shot a 117 to tie for 19th place with Circle's Taylor Walls. Lyndsey Stuart and Gracie Johnston both tied for 22nd with a score of 123 to round out the Orioles' scoring. Stuart won the tiebreaker over her teammate. Katie Webster wasn't far behind with a 125 for the Orioles. Central finished with one qualifier. Rachel Wiebe shot a 104 to take fifth place overall and was the third best individual golfer not on a qualifying team. Emily Miles tied for 16th with a 115 for the Jaguars. She was the first individual to miss the cut, which was by just two strokes. Erin Flahive and Maddy Miles both shot a 124 for the Jaguars. State will be next Monday at the Hays-Smoky Hill Country Club in Hays.
