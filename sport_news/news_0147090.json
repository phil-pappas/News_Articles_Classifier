I've got a few niggles just from coming back so I need to let them settle down and hopefully I can kick on again next week. \n\"I felt good. It's just a case of building on it now. Hopefully next week I can get a 70-minute game in and then move on to a full game in the coming weeks. \n\"It's up to the manager (Mark Hughes) to see when I can get back involved. I haven't trained with the first team yet so I'll look forward to doing that. \n\"But I will stay with the under-21s for probably another week or so. It's all about game time and then we'll see after that. At the moment I'm trying to make sure I get the right minutes and the training between them is right.\" \nThe 28-year-old added: \"It's a relief after quite a while of being impinged that I can move freely. My day to day life has been a lot better and it's been quite nice. I can pick up my kids again. \n\"It had got to the stage where it was getting a bit silly. The right decision was made. Unfortunately I've missed a bit of football but it had to be done.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:38.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
