I know those feel empty for many of you with the Bengals not playing, for those of us caught up in the constant grind ever since training camp started in July, few weekends are sweeter. The imprint on my couch digs a little deeper today. \nAs for the Bengals, sitting around and watching turned out to be profitable with Kansas City pulling the upset at home against Pittsburgh. The Chiefs had lost five in a row, but were able to take down the Steelers with Landry Jones at quarterback. All signs point to Ben Roethlisberger returning next week against the Bengals, but partially due to his injury, the Steelers must dig out of a 2.5-game hole if they want to catch the Bengals. \nIf you consider the fact they would face a 3.5-game deficit and still have to come to Cincinnati if they can't pull off the victory Sunday, the importance of the tilt Sunday at Heinz Field raises dramatically for a game this time of year. \nI remember surveying the table at Beyond The Stripes of what they think the Steelers' record would be during the month he was expected to miss. Nearly all said 2-2. Turned out to be true, though, not the wins/losses we expected. Without your leader you can only hold the pieces together for so long. Still, Sunday will be the first game all year they play with Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant, Le'Veon Bell all on the field together. Eventually they add Maurkice Pouncey to the mix. They are incredibly dangerous. \nAs The Carpenters would say ... \nON TAP TODAY \nThe team returns from bye week for their first practice. We will learn more about the status of Vontaze Burfict this week. He could be a participant in today's practice. Keep an eye on the Twitter accounts of Jim-O ( @JimOwczarski ) and I ( @pauldehnerjr ) for updates on what we see. \nTWITTER QUESTION OF THE DAY @pauldehnerjr if Hue is hired as a HC, would you think @Bengals pursue Gruden if @Redskins let him go? — Michael Oshita (@MichaelOshita) October 25, 2015 \nThanks for the question, Michael. That small object barely viewable over the horizon would be the cart in front of your horse. \nI think Hue Jackson has absolutely coached his way into a head coaching job. He was close with Buffalo last year and that was before he found a way to transform Andy Dalton in Year 5. If Dalton and the Bengals offense continues down this path he will be near the top of every team's list. This league is defined by developing quarterbacks. That looks mighty pretty on top of his resume. So, say he does land a head job and all stays the same here. You also need Gruden to get fired in Washington. Which, with Daniel Snyder is always a reality, but he does have them at 3-4 with Kirk Cousins at QB, RG3 scandal aside. \nI'm sure there would be interest should those two scenarios play out. The coaching staff is comfortable with him, Gruden knows the players here well. This franchise LOVES known quantities. Gruden would be that. To speculate anywhere beyond wouldn't be fair to any party involved. Far too many variables. \nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT \nFantastic deep dive from Jim-O into why the Bengals remarkable health this season could span well beyond luck , rather at a carefully constructed change to the program taking care of players' bodies. This could end up the most important story of the season should this health continue. \nBENGALS BYE WEEK EXPLOITS \nCarlos Dunlap, NFL sack leader entering the weekend, dropped into ESPN on Sunday to join their coverage. — Carlos Dunlap (@Carlos_Dunlap) October 25, 2015 \nAROUND THE DIVISION \nSteelers (4-3): Pittsburgh's defense needed to carry them through this rough patch and they couldn't. Still, optimism reigns with Ben's return. \nBrowns (2-5): Josh McCown goes out in loss to St. Louis and JFF, set to be questioned by the NFL, might be the starter in Cleveland. They play the Bengals in 10 days. \nRavens (1-5): Baltimore's depleted secondary will be tested against Arizona. They think a win on MNF could flip their season. \nBY THE NUMBERS \nWill be many questions, I assume, about how the Bengals play coming off a bye week. Here's the rundown. In the Marvin Lewis Era they rank 29th in the NFL in record coming off a bye (4-7-1, 36%). Placing a little whip cream on that dung, they rank near the middle of the pack in those games against the spread number. Basically, they've played some quality opponents after a bye and still kept many of them close. \nSince 2009, they are in the middle of the pack, 3-3 after a bye. They are 2-2 in the Dalton-Green Era. \nTEAM TWEET OF THE WEEKEND \nKirk Cousins. All jacked up. How do you feel about Victory Monday? #YouLikeThat pic.twitter.com/EyXui6qxTo — Washington Redskins (@Redskins) October 26, 2015 \nRANDOMNESS \nPretty sure this ridiculous spider found in the rainforest is related to a bug I killed in my basement earlier this year. \nHistory of the Reebok Pump. Hell yes I had the pump. Though stories of overpumping shoe explosion kind of scared me. \nStanford offensive lineman goes street fight destruction block mode . Honestly looks like a scene out of an embellished football movie. \nMuch credit to ESPN o n this spoof of Angels in the Outfield as a 30 for 30 . \"Nobody ever took time to ask why this manager was spending so much time with two little boys.\" \nAND FINALLY \nIn honor of Ben's likely return to the Steelers, I'm sure this would fit around Pittsburgh this weekend. 14 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1S5ZLNv TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:57:13.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
