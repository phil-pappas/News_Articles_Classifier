Since the firing of Joe Philbin on Oct. 5, the Dolphins (3-3) have gone from notorious underachievers to contending for their first playoff berth since 2008.\nThe Dolphins had been 0-7 previously against Houston (2-5). Miami’s four long scores in the first half were the most in at least 75 years, according to STATS.\nGIANTS 27, COWBOYS 20: Dwayne Harris sped 100 yards with a kickoff return against his former Dallas teammates seconds after the Cowboys had tied the game as New York moved atop the NFC East.\nHarris spent four seasons in Dallas without running back a kickoff for a score. But he tied a Giants record set in 1994 by romping untouched to the end zone.\nNew York (4-3) snapped a five-game slide against Dallas (2-4) thanks to big plays by its defence and special teams. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie had two interceptions, returning one 58 yards for a touchdown.\nThe Cowboys, losers of four in a row without injured offensive stars Tony Romo and Dez Bryant, got a big game from Darren McFadden, who rushed for 152 yards and a TD.\nREDSKINS 31, BUCCANEERS 30: Kirk Cousins threw three second-half touchdown passes, including the go-ahead score with 24 seconds left, to lead Washington to the largest comeback in franchise history.\nTampa Bay (2-4) was up 24-0 in the second quarter before Cousins ran for an eight-yard TD to get Washington (3-4) on the board.\nCousins hadn’t completed more than one TD pass in any game all season. But he got a pair of three-yard scores in the third quarter.\nTrailing 30-24, Washington got the ball at its 20 with a little less than 2 ½ minutes left in the fourth quarter. Cousins capped the drive with a six-yard TD toss to Jordan Reed.\nRAIDERS 37, CHARGERS 29: Derek Carr threw three touchdown passes, including a 52-yarder to Amari Cooper, and Oakland turned two interceptions of Philip Rivers into 10 points on their way to an easy victory over in what could be the last game of the AFC West rivalry played in San Diego.\nIt was the first meeting of the Raiders (3-3) and Chargers (2-5) since their owners announced plans to build a $1.7 billion (U.S.) stadium in an industrial Los Angeles suburb if they can’t get new stadiums in their home markets.\nSan Diego made it close with three fourth-quarter touchdowns.\nVIKINGS 28, LIONS 19: Teddy Bridgewater threw for a season-high 316 yards and two touchdowns for Minnesota and Adrian Peterson rushed for 98 yards as the Vikings (4-2) won an NFC North game on the road for the first time in three years.\nThe Lions (1-6) had an 11-point lead after Matthew Stafford threw TDs on their first two drives but they blew it because they couldn’t protect the quarterback.\nMinnesota had a season-high seven sacks, which also was a season worst for Detroit.\nFALCONS 10, TITANS 7: Matt Ryan threw for 251 yards and a touchdown pass and Devonta Freeman ran for 116 yards.\nThe Falcons (6-1) bounced back from their first loss by grinding out a road win and overcoming two interceptions. Freeman notched his third consecutive game with at least 100 yards, and Atlanta outgained Tennessee 378-256.\nThe banged-up Titans (1-5) lost their fifth straight overall. They played without rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota, who was replaced by Zach Mettenberger.\nRAMS 24, BROWNS 6: Rookie running back Todd Gurley rushed for 128 yards and his first two touchdowns in guiding St. Louis to victory.\nSt. Louis (3-3) had four sacks and recovered four fumbles. The Rams scored 10 points off miscues on Cleveland’s first two series, a 17-yard fumble recovery by Rodney McLeod and a field goal after the first of William Hayes’ two sacks and strips of Josh McCown on the day.\nQuarterback Johnny Manziel got mop-up duty for the Browns (2-5) after McCown left favouring his right arm with about four minutes left.\nCHIEFS 23, STEELERS 13: Alex Smith threw for 251 yards and a touchdown and Cairo Santos kicked three field goals as Kansas City ended a five-game losing streak.\nCharcandrick West added 110 yards rushing and his first career touchdown for the Chiefs (2-5), and Eric Berry intercepted his first pass since his cancer diagnosis last December.\nMeanwhile, the Chiefs shut down Pittsburgh’s Landry Jones, who made his first NFL start in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger and Mike Vick. Jones threw for 209 yards and a touchdown but was picked off twice and lost a fumble.\nLeVeon Bell ran for 121 yards for the Steelers (4-3).\nSAINTS 27, COLTS 21: Drew Brees threw for 255 yards and one touchdown and Khiry Robinson ran for two scores as New Orleans held on for the victory.\nNew Orleans (3-4) has won three of its past four. Indy (3-4) still leads the AFC South despite losing its second straight.\nBrees finished 28 of 44 and was helped by a running game led by Mark Ingram, who ran for 143 yards and one score as New Orleans took a 27-0 lead.\nAndrew Luck threw TD passes of 87 and 46 yards to T.Y. Hilton and an eight-yard TD pass to Donte Moncrief with 3:46 left to make it 27-21.\nMore on thestar.com\nRelentless attitude, speed got Kansas City Royals to the World Series\nBrady rallies Patriots to victory over New York Jets", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:15:41.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
