Kate Brown has denied Oregon death row inmate Mark Allen Pinnell's request to spend his final days outside of prison in hospice care.\nHis lawyer had sent a letter to Brown's office Thursday, asking for her urgent review of Pinnell's request , citing his deteriorating health. He's suffering from severe chronic pulmonary disease and had been moved off death row to the Oregon State Penitentiary's infirmary.\nIn a letter typed a day later but mailed back to Pinnell's lawyer Monday, Brown wrote that an immediate commutation of Pinnell's sentence wasn't warranted.\n\"The power to grant executive clemency is a responsibility that I take very seriously,'' Brown wrote . \"I believe that a Governor's clemency power should be exercised sparingly. The separation of powers inherent in our system of government and respect for the workings of the judicial system require that the Governor's clemency power be used in only the most extraordinary of circumstances.''\nPinnell's lawyer, federal public defender Teresa A. Hampton, declined comment on the decision.\nPinnell, 67, was among the first to seek clemency after former Gov. John Kitzhaber declared a moratorium on executions in November 2011. He has been on death row since 1988.\nPinnell and co-defendant Donald E. Cornell both robbed and killed 65-year-old John Wallace Ruffner in his Tualatin apartment in 1985. Cornell is a free man, having left prison in 2011 after serving nearly 26 years behind bars.\nPinnell remains at the infirmary where he's receiving palliative care, according to Betty Bernt, spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Corrections.\nHe's in his own room that's larger than a cell with a hospital bed and muraled walls, Bernt said. He has access to immediate health care, but security is present anytime anyone is in the room with him, she said. The prison's superintendent and medical services manager are monitoring his situation weekly.\nHe's not allowed around other inmates, who typically volunteer in the prison's hospice care program, she said.\n\"We are doing everything we can to make him comfortable. We are treating him with humanity and compassion,'' she said.\nKitzhaber in February denied Pinnell's clemency request, saying he was unable to review Pinnell's application before the end of his term. Pinnell renewed a clemency request to Brown in August, and her office responded that a review could take up to six months.\nPinnell's August request for clemency, titled \"Mercy for a dying man,'' noted that he was rushed to Salem General Hospital twice in July for extended stays. His lawyer provided the governor's office with medical records that reflect his dire prognosis and argued that the prison is incapable of providing the \"escalating care and equipment'' that Pinnell's condition requires.\nIn his own letter to the governor on Aug. 5, Pinnell wrote, \"I am a weak, old man. I pose no threat to society. I am very ashamed and sorry for what I did. I'm asking for mercy. Please release me from prison so that I can spend my last days near my family rather than at the Oregon State Penitentiary.''\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:32:39.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
