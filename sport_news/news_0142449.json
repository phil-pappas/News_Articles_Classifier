Chip Kelly kept Sturgis even after he missed an extra point and a 33-yard field goal last week. The Eagles' three losses are by an average of five points, so the kicking game could be critical. When the Saints have the ball \nThe Saints offense is built around Drew Brees, who threw his 400th career touchdown pass in an overtime win over Dallas last week. Brees missed Week 3 with a shoulder injury, but he was back to his old self last week, when he completed 80.5 percent of passes for 359 yards and two touchdowns. He's in his 10th year in Sean Payton's offense, and Eagles defensive coordinator Bill Davis compared Brees to an offensive coordinator at the line of scrimmage. But he is adjusting to a new cast around him that is not as tight end-oriented without Jimmy Graham. Brees' top receiver is Brandin Cooks, a 5-foot-10, 189-pound, 2014 first-round pick who has been compared to DeSean Jackson. He still has veteran Marques Colston in the slot, and unheralded second-year receiver Willie Snead leads the team with 240 yards. The Saints also like to pass to their running backs - Mark Ingram and C.J. Spiller are productive catching out of the backfield. \nThe Saints' offensive line has struggled this year, allowing 10 sacks. Their best player is left tackle Terron Armstead, who has not allowed a sack. Left guard Tom Lelito could have a hard time containing Fletcher Cox. Frankford alum Jahri Evans is back at right guard after missing time earlier this season. \nThe Saints use a three-headed running back rotation of Ingram, Spiller, and Khiry Robinson. Ingram is the top rusher and had his best week of the season with a 77-yard effort against the Cowboys. The Eagles will have Cedric Thornton and Taylor Hart back on the defensive line after both players missed the last two games. \nHowever, the Eagles will be without linebacker Mychal Kendricks because of a hamstring injury. Rookie Jordan Hicks will start again, and the Eagles could be pressed into playing more dime defense than nickel defense. Byron Maxwell is playing after leaving last week's game early because of a quadriceps injury, and nickel safety Chris Maragos should also be back in the lineup. \nPay attention to time of possession. The Eagles defense was on the field for more than 41 minutes in last week's loss to Washington. The big number \n60.25: Plays from scrimmage the Eagles offense averages each game. They're ranked No. 26 in total plays - a departure from the last two seasons, when the Eagles were in the top two. Their 70.4 plays per game in 2014 led the league, and their 65.8 plays per game in 2013 were second only to the Denver Broncos. The play total was raised by Chip Kelly last week when responding to Murray's comment that he wasn't getting enough touches. The Eagles like to spread the ball around, but that can only be done if there are enough plays. The only way to make sure Murray, Ryan Mathews, Darren Sproles, Jordan Matthews, Nelson Agholor, and Zach Ertz - among others - get the touches they need is by approaching 70 plays per game. \"[If] we can stay on the field and snap it for 68, 70 plays,\" Kelly said, \"we are going to have a lot more balance in our run and pass game.\" The bottom line \nZach Berman: Eagles 28, Saints 27 \nJeff McLane: Eagles 27, Saints 24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:11:47.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
