Boykin of No. 3 TCU, was named on 29 surveys, including four which gave him a nod for first.\nUSA TODAY\nSmall shifts before big ones in the NCAA 1-128 Re-rank\nBoykin is second in the country in passing touchdowns with 21, one behind Baylor’s Seth Russell, and second in total offense at 411.5 yards a game. He is sixth in passing yards and passing efficiency.\nOhio State running back Ezekiel Elliott remained third.\nA new player made his first appearance on any of the surveys so far this season: Florida State running back Dalvin Cook in fourth place.\nCook ran for 222 yards and two touchdowns in the No. 8 Seminoles’ 29-24 victory over Miami on Saturday.\nUSA TODAY\nA new No. 1 team in the College Football Computer Composite\nWhen the preseason began, Cook wasn’t even sure he’d play. He had been suspended by FSU after allegedly punching a woman outside a bar in June. His status was so tenuous the Seminoles took two team photos — one with him, one without him.\nBut in late August, he was found not guilty and was reinstated. He is sixth in the country with 792 yards rushing and eight TDs. He is second in average yards per game at 158.4 but that is almost 50 per game behind Fournette.\nOnly eight players received votes, the smallest field since the survey began after the third week of the season. Eleven were mentioned last week. One of those, Georgia running back Nick Chubb, saw his season all but end with a knee injury.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/rankings/2015/10/12/1-128-fbs-re-rank-tcu-florida-clemson-michigan-college-football/73801334/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0c979f68521949b2a749eacbf7601871597cfb3c/c=621-0-2427-1806/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802106276661206-USP-NCAA-FOOTBALL-TEXAS-CHRISTIAN-AT-KANSAS-STATE-76648172.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/326f7eb2019422a6859dd15bf42c2b8faee9997b/c=816-0-4080-3264/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802417892129750-AP-NORTHWESTERN-MICHIGAN-FOOTBALL-76679712.JPG", "http://imgur.com/xUebEnY.png", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/rankings/2015/10/12/college-football-computer-composite-rankings-tcu-michigan/73788414/"], "published": "2015-10-12T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:28:45.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
