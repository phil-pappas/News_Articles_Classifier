Liberty junior Raisa Kochmaruk repeated as individual champion in a time of 18 minutes, 52 seconds on the course at the Bethlehem Executive Municipal Golf Course. \nTurning point: The Rovers put their first five runners in the top 17. Game, set, match. \nTop performer: Kochmaruk dropped her time 25 seconds from her best time on this course last season. \nWhat it means: Markers have been laid down for next week’s District 11 championships on the same course. Easton and Kochmaruk will both be tough to beat. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @bradwsports .
