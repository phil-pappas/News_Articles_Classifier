Instead, the Vikings found relief in the form of wide receiver Jake Peterson.\nThe 6-foot senior hadn’t taken a snap in a game since appearing as a quarterback for the junior varsity squad as a sophomore, but Peterson looked like a natural. He exploded for 199 yards and four touchdowns in a 36-13 rout of Rockland, then rushed for 101 more yards and two scores in a 21-0 shutout of South Shore League rival Abington.\nGraham is back, having split time with regular backup Greg Plunkett (who was out with mono for the previous two games), but Peterson’s personal sacrifice for the good of his team remains a big reason why the Vikings stand unbeaten through five games.\n“He’s the ultimate team player,” East Bridgewater coach Shawn Tarpey said in praise of Peterson. “To have a guy like Jake be able to step in there and do what he did, I’ve never seen anything like it.\n“He put on a pair of incredible performances. He’s guided us through two of the toughest wins that we thought we were going to have to get in our league. And to win pretty convincingly in both, he’s helped this program out more than I think he’ll ever know. To this point, he’s been the heart and soul of what we’ve accomplished.”\nAnd after seeing what Peterson is capable of after two weeks with the ball in his hands more often than he normally would as a wide receiver, the Vikings plan to make sure they use more of what they already have designed for their star.\n“We haven’t changed anything because we had a lot of things in to get Petey the ball, we’re just working on them more in practice,” Tarpey said. “It just reaffirmed our commitment to getting him the ball more. We’ve worked on these in practice and we haven’t always done them, and now we know we need to do more of it.”\nPeterson’s performance should come as no surprise from a kid who unfortunately had to become the man of the house when his father, John, died unexpectedly in March 2009 when Peterson was in the sixth grade.\nThe youngest of four children, Peterson always looked to his father John as an influence. Whether it was baseball, football or lacrosse, John Peterson was always there to help his youngest son and push him to become better both in sports and in life.\nJake’s older brothers, Eric and Kurt, were away at college when their father died, leaving just Jake and his sister Jenny to rally around their mother Meg. Every Friday night, the bleachers are filled with family members, including Peterson’s aunts and uncles, cheering for every big play the talented playmaker comes up with.\n“The support my mom gives me is amazing,” Peterson said. “She’s my No. 1 fan out there every week. I love seeing her and all of my family at my games.”\nPeterson still carries his father’s memory with him every day, often reflecting back on the things his father taught him and sending a few prayers his way before each game. He earned South Shore League All-Star honors as a junior and is well on his way to repeating that, something he relishes more for his family than for himself.\n“I take a lot of pride in being able to have success for my mom and my dad,” Peterson said. “It means a lot to me. I do it all for them. I do it just to make my family happy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:28:57.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
