Forward Tim McGauley was placed on the 30-day injury list and does not count against the overage quota, leaving Brandon with Macoy Erkamps, Colton Waltz and import Rihards Bukarts as its 20-year-olds. A subsequent decision will have to be made when McGauley returns. \nHead coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon said Lisoway was an important member of the team. \n\"Quintin was such a respected player by his teammates,\" McCrimmon said. \"He was likely never appreciated by the fans like he would be by teammates; he was a competitive guy, he was a good leader, he was a good teammate. We would have loved to have been able to have him on our team but at the same time, that’s the way we felt the decision had to go.\" \nLisoway had 20 goals and 27 assists in 171 WHL games. \nShortly after practice, the team announced that Erkamps would be the 58th captain in franchise history. \n\"It’s a huge honour,\" Erkamps said. \"You see the guys in the past that wore the ‘C’ and there are a bunch of amazing names. Just to be a part of that group and to be recognized as a leader by your teammates and your coaching staff and the whole organization, that’s a huge honour.\" \nThe six-foot, 198-pound defenceman has played in 276 career WHL  games with Brandon and the Lethbridge Hurricanes. In seven games this season, he has three goals and six assists. \nHe last served as a team captain in bantam. \nErkamps said the Wheat Kings have a good core group who lead in different ways. \n\"I think all the guys would tell you that I’m the loudest one, no matter where we go,\" Erkamps said. \"I’m going to stick to that and be the vocal guy.\" \nColton Waltz was named one of the alternate captains, while McGauley, Nolan Patrick and John Quenneville will share the other two letters. \nThe team also had a new face on the ice in practice this week, 18-year-old Steinbach Pistons defenceman James Shearer, last season’s Manitoba Junior Hockey League rookie of the year. \n\"I just wanted to see James in practice for a couple of days,\" McCrimmon said. \"We thought this week would be a good week to do it. We put James on our protected list a week ago.\" \nMcCrimmon said a decision on whether the former Brandon Midget AAA Wheat Kings player will dress in a WHL game hasn’t been made. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:04:19.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
