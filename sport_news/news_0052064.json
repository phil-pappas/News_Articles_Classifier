Bankston was in his personal vehicle, which was equipped with lights and a siren.\n\"He actually deployed that siren to get the vehicle to pull over,\" said Sheriff Ard.\nBankston was wearing a shirt from the FBI Citizens Academy and a cap during the traffic stop. Bankston was also found to be in possession of ' special operations' credentials from the Department of Justice and commissions from West and East Baton Rouge Parishes.\n\" We were able to confirm that he was not a commissioned deputy in either parish, \" said Sheriff Ard.\nAs the investigation progressed, a prescription bottle containing a Schedule IV CDS was found in Bankston’s vehicle. The medication was located in a bottle belonging to someone other than Bankston.\nSheriff Ard says, \"We removed the emergency lights and sirens from Bankston’s vehicle and Mr. Bankston was placed under arrest.\"\nBankston remains in the Livingston Parish Detention Center where he is being held on a $35,000 bond.\nThe driver of the vehicle Bankston stopped was released at the scene.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
