Bass Jr. told attorneys about 2 p.m. today. \"I'll probably declare a mistrial.\"\nBut Bass added it was only speculation \"because I have no idea of what they're hung up on.\"\nJurors returned from lunch shortly before 2 p.m. They have deliberated for more than 10 hours since getting the case Thursday.\nJurors returned today at 8:30 a.m. after an overnight recess in the case. Bass sent jurors home about 6:30 p.m. Thursday, and instructed them to return at 8:30 a.m. today with fresh minds to resume deliberations. He sent the evidence to the jury at about 10:30 a.m. yesterday to begin deliberations.\nThree former jail workers - former deputies Jason Kenny and Maxine Evans and Corizon contract nurse Gregory Brown - are charged in the case. Each has pleaded not guilty and remain free on bonds.\nAjibade, 21, died late Jan. 1 or early Jan. 2 while strapped in a restraint seat after an altercation with jailers.\nProsecutors contend Kenny drive stunned Ajibade, who they claimed was not resisting, four times with a Taser and that he died of a combination of events. Primary to their case is their contention that Ajibade was left unattended for an hour and a half while the defendants ignored him,then attempted to cover up their actions.\nDefense attorneys contend there is no proven cause or time of death and that the defendants did not cause Ajibade’s death.\nKenny, 31, and Evans, 56, are on trial for involuntary manslaughter for causing Ajibade’s death “without any intention to do so.” The charge said that Kenny caused the death during the commission of “reckless conduct...without intention to do so by tasing (Ajibade) while he was restrained.”\nEvans is charged with reckless conduct by failing to monitor Ajibade’s status.\nIn addition, both are charged in two separate indictments with committing perjury before the Chatham County grand jury that was hearing the case in what the state contends was part of an attempt to cover up their involvement in the death.\nBass has granted an acquittal for Brown on the involuntary manslaughter charge.\nBrown, 45, remains in the case on charges of public records fraud and making a false statement to investigators.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Kenny_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Ajibade_7.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Evans_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Evans_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Brown_7.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Ajibade_7.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Kenny_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Brown_7.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:15:06.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
