(Photo: Rich Schultz, AP) \nRyan Dunleavy of the Asbury Park Press has the answers to your Rutgers football questions: \nQUESTION: Scale of 1-10 question for you. What's the fan enthusiasm level for this game, this season and this coaching staff? Is Kyle Flood going to survive all this trouble? \nANSWER: If it wasn't the promoted \"Black-out\" game, my number would be lower. As is, I'd say about 5. A vocal segment of the fan base already has given up on the season and on the coaching staff. On the surface, it's ridiculous considering Rutgers is 2-2 – not 2-8 – and Kyle Flood was 23-16 during his first three years, including last year's surprise 8-5 run. But ineffectiveness recruiting top talent in-state, struggles against the Big Ten's best and the much-hated Penn State, and the many controversies of the last month have many fans fed up. Still, Flood maintains the support of the program's biggest booster, Jeff Towers. Whether Flood survives will depend on his record the rest of the way and on whether anything more is uncovered as Rutgers and outside counsel investigate the program for any potential NCAA violations, be it in Flood's academic improprieties, in the drug-testing program or in the recruiting ambassador program. \nQ: Of all the things that have happened, how shocking was Leonte Carroo's situation? \nA: Of all the things that went wrong for Rutgers in the last two months, Carroo's situation may be the most surprising to me. He had a clean public record for three years – with a public savvy beyond his years – and took ownership of his first mistake, when he was suspended for the first half of the season opener for a curfew violation. Then comes the simple assault under domestic violence allegation that led to his two-game suspension. The case was dismissed this week when the accuser decided not to testify, and Carroo, who nearly left school after last season to enter the NFL Draft, was reinstated. There still are a lot of questions about what actually happened that may never get answered, even by police. Losing Carroo was an enormous blow, as he was the face of the program and also the only vertical threat in the passing game. Without him, the offense went into a conservative shell. Now that he's back, it should be a huge lift, emotionally and in productivity. \nQ: Chris Laviano seems to be a promising young quarterback, and Rutgers obviously has three good backs and another electric player in Janarion Grant. How is Rutgers up front and can this offense get anything done against Michigan State with an extra week to prepare? \nA: Laviano leads the Big Ten in completion percentage but his near-refusal to throw the ball down the field is a sore spot with Rutgers fans, plenty of whom want to see LSU transfer Hayden Rettig at quarterback. Halfback is the team's deepest position, with three proven options – Paul James, Josh Hicks and Robert Martin – rotating through fresh legs. But what good is any of that if the timing on everything is rushed because the blocking doesn't hold up? Rutgers has three-first year starters on the offensive line. Third-year starting left tackle Keith Lumpkin could hold his own against Shilique Calhoun, but the interior of the offensive line is the cause for concern. Penn State stuffed Rutgers' running game and had Laviano running for his life way too often. Plus, the offensive line is a major reason why Rutgers is one of the most penalized teams in the country. \nQ: How good is this Rutgers defense? Better than the defense that came to Spartan Stadium a year ago? Will that ugly game be any kind of motivator for the Scarlet Knights? \nA: Rutgers' defense could have been a big improvement over last year's defense at full strength. As is, Rutgers is without its best defensive player – defensive tackle Darius Hamilton suffered a season-ending injury and hopes to redshirt. On top of that, the secondary was ravaged just before the season-opener, when four defensive backs simultaneously were dismissed after getting arrested. So far the unit has held up, but Connor Cook's eyes must be lighting up to see this amount of youth. Consider: None of Rutgers top four cornerbacks had any game experience until this year. There are a few playmakers who can impact a game, however. Raw talent Kemoko Turay knows his way to the quarterback; middle linebacker Kaiwan Lewis, a graduate transfer from South Carolina, plays with Big Ten toughness; and outside linebacker Steve Longa is a tackling machine. \nQ: Your keys to the game and a prediction if you care to give one. \nA: -- Can Rutgers avoid falling behind big early, thus allowing the rushing attack to develop and avoiding situations where Michigan State's pass rush can tee off on the offensive line? \n--What kind of impact will Carroo's return have? Will Rutgers try to test the Michigan State secondary downfield in order to keep the defense honest? \n--How does the secondary hold up against a savvy veteran like Cook? \nPrediction: Michigan State 31, Rutgers 10.
