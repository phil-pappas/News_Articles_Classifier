The incident led to a penalty for the Chennai-based Armaan. \n\nConsequently, he lost track position and his Sri Lankan teammate Dilantha Malagamuwa, who later took over the drive, eventually fought his way to finish a commendable fourth. \n\n\"I had started the race from seventh position and moved up to third. I then went for the second position and, in the process, had a side-by-side contact with another competitor who spun. I was subsequently handed a drive-through penalty which I served immediately,\" Armaan said. \n\n\"I then pushed hard before handing over the car to Dilantha who then did a consistent job to bring the car home in fourth position. We were very disappointed at the penalty, for I thought it was purely a racing incident, but then, that is motorsport. There was nothing we could do.\" \n\nArmaan and Dilantha, following their second and fourth place finishes in the double-header, remained third in the championship going into next month's final round at the Sebring International Raceway, the oldest racing track in the United States. \n\nLooking back over the weekend, Armaan said: \"We started well with the second place finish in the first race on Saturday. We had good pace through the weekend and we were looking forward to another podium in the second race but for the penalty. We hope to do well in Sebring next month. As always, we will give it our best shot and see what comes out of it.\" \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:49:46.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
