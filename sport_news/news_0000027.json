It was at that moment that Dave and Kev’s Totally Irreverent Redneck Golf Classic (for charity) was born. A moment that will live in infamy. A beer fueled, infamous moment.\nDave Wilcox and Kevin Crawford are two of the top Real Estate professionals in South Texas, and while they’re very good at selling real estate, they’re even better at having fun and raising money. What started as a crazy idea snowballed to a borderline out of control level in 2014, when they held their first event at The Quarry Golf Club. Relying on the loyalties of clients and friends that believed in them, they sold out their first tournament and raised over $47,000 for the BAMC Fisher House, with no experience. Kevin says “the most fun part of the whole thing last year was seeing some of San Antonio’s most successful professionals totally throw self respect out the window in order to act like a fool for a day.”\nDetermined to make this tournament different and memorable, Dave and Kev created an environment that would undoubtedly irritate most serious golfers, but would surely be talked about for months to come. All teams were encouraged to dress in costume and would receive strokes off their score if they did. All sponsors were encouraged to have a party on their hole. Cheating, loud music and talking in backswings were also encouraged. Almost immediately the tournament caught the ears of Lone Star Beer of San Antonio, who agreed to become the title sponsor. Other sponsors such as Whataburger & Cavender’s Boot City quickly followed suit and asked to help sponsor.\nUpon opening registration for the second annual tournament, being held October 22, 2015, they almost immediately sold out their player packages. “Golf is dumb, and people are finally starting to realize that a tourney like ours is the only way to really have any fun,” Dave states. They’re currently looking for a few more hole sponsors and for one sponsor really willing to step up and support our troops and the BAMC Fisher House, for a $100,000 donation, Dave and Kev will get their logo tattooed on their rear ends. The goal is to grow this tournament into a nationally recognized event and offer all the support we can to our men and women who volunteer to serve and die for us every day.\nFor press inquiries or sponsorship opportunities contact:\nKevin Crawford\n210-380-5386\nwww.DaveAndKev.com", "external_links": ["http://www.daveandkev.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:06:35.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
