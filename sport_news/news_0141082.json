Paul T. Erickson/Tri-City Herald Tri-City Herald file i Order Reprint of this Story \nWashington should see a small uptick in seasonal retail hiring this holiday season, though metropolitan areas, including the Tri-Cities, are more likely to see fewer such jobs. \nThe Washington Employment Security Department estimates 15,000 temporary workers, mostly in retail, to be hired for the Christmas shopping season, which typically stretches from October to late December. \nThat would be a 1.7 percent increase over last year’s seasonal hires. \nNationally, outplacement consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimates relatively flat holiday hiring at 755,000 during the next few months. \nBut of the hiring estimates given for Washington state’s 11 largest cities and urban areas, only Olympia is expected to see more Christmas season workers. \nKennewick is projected to have about 550 people hired to temporary positions. \nThat would be a 25 percent drop from the more than 730 hired last year. No individual figures were provided for Richland or Pasco. \nState economist Paul Turek said the expected bump in seasonal hiring around the state is a reflection of retail positions becoming balanced between rural and urban areas. \nAnd Kennewick’s decline is less an indicator of the region’s economy and more a sign of shopping trends. \n“Urban shoppers are more Internet savvy,” he said, noting that online sales are taking a bigger share of shoppers’ money in the state’s more populated communities. “As a result, we don’t see the need for hiring there.” \nAt the same time, retailers had 700 more people on the job in August, the most recent month with job data, compared to a year ago. \nThat also satisfies the need for more staff come the holiday shopping season, Turek said. \nTy Beaver: 509-582-1402; tbeaver@tricityherald.com ; Twitter: @_tybeaver Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:32:45.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
