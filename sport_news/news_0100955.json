(File photo) × CLEMSON – Clemson University provided a statement Thursday just before noon regarding possible weather concerns stemming from Hurricane Joaquin for No. 12 Clemson’s home game against No. 6 Notre Dame scheduled for Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC: “Clemson Athletics, campus and local officials continue to monitor the changing weather conditions as we approach the weekend and have been in contact with the National Weather Service and the Atlantic Coast Conference.” “At this time, everything is scheduled as planned and we intend to continue on that path unless authorities advise us otherwise - in which case we’ll inform our fans, guests and students immediately.” Local weather reports in upstate South Carolina indicate storm patterns are unpredictable based on the path of Hurricane Joaquin, currently moving from the Bahamas toward the eastern coast of the United States. Up to 4-6 inches of rain are forecasted for Saturday into early Sunday morning. A source indicated the notion of playing the game Sunday “has not been discussed.” ESPN’s SportsCenter On the Road is set to broadcast live from Clemson Saturday from 7-9 a.m., and College GameDay is scheduled for 9 a.m.-12 p.m. Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:51:04.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
