Sports, which has obtained an advanced copy of the book. \nThe book entitled, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" is written by Louisville resident Katina Powell, a self-described madam who allegedly provided women - including her own daughter - for the UofL team, and Indianapolis-based, and former Pulitzer Prize-winning, journalist Dick Cady. The book, which is being published by IBJ Book Publishing, LLC in Indianapolis, is based on hundreds of journal entries and thousands of text messages kept by Powell. \n\"We were very disappointed, surprised and shocked,\" UofL Vice President and Director of Athletics Tom Jurich said about the book's allegations via teleconference at a news conference late Friday afternoon. \"We've been working on this since the end of August, doing all our due diligence.\" \n\"To say I'm disheartened, disappointed would probably be the biggest understatement I've made since I've been a coach,\" UofL coach Rick Pitino said. \nThe book, according to the Yahoo! story, identifies Andre McGee, a former UofL player, graduate assistant coach and Director of Basketball Operations, as the one who paid Powell for her staff's services. McGee played for the Cardinals from 2005-09, then was a grad assistant from 2010-12 and director of basketball ops from 2012-14 before spending last season as an assistant coach at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. At UMKC he worked under another former Pitino assistant coach, Kareem Richardson. \nIn her book, according to an article published by the Indianapolis Business Journal , 43-year-old Powell provided entertainment for 22 parties, many at Billy Minardi Hall, from 2010-14. \nUofL issued a statement about the book late Friday afternoon. \nHere is the statement UofL released in its entirety: \n\"The University of Louisville first learned of these allegations when the Indianapolis Business Journal contacted the University’s sports information department seeking comment in late August. \n\"The University was shocked to hear of the allegations. The University’s athletics compliance department was immediately notified. Chuck Smrt of the Compliance Group was retained to conduct a thorough, objective review of this information. Mr. Smrt is an outside expert who has 34 years of NCAA regulatory experience, including over 17 years with the NCAA enforcement staff. \n\"In coordination with the University’s legal counsel and faculty athletics representative, Mr. Smrt’s review was quickly launched to assess the validity of the information and the potential for any NCAA rules violations. The University, on its own initiative, notified the NCAA Enforcement Staff regarding this matter and has been in regular communication with them. \n\"The University of Louisville will continue its review in full cooperation and coordination with the NCAA and if warranted, take any appropriate action. The allegations have been taken very seriously. In no way would anyone at this institution condone the alleged activities. To preserve the integrity of the review process, the University will withhold comment on any details until the review is concluded.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:34:16.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
