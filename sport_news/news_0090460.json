Its balance was particularly notable. \nStahl, a tight end on offense, even caught the first touchdown pass of his varsity career on a 7-yard strike to the back of the end zone from quarterback JJ Scarpello. The touchdown made the score 21-0 with just over three minutes left in the first half. \nIt was one of three touchdown passes for Scarpello who completed 9 of 16 passes for 148 yards without turning the ball over. \n\"It starts up front with our blocking and our fullback,\" Scarpello said. \"Our plays are working, and we're executing well right now.\" \nThe run game, as usual, was strong for Seneca, highlighted by a 46-yard score from Chris Pawlikowski that made it 28-0 midway through the third quarter. \n\"Our kids are playing tough,\" coach Bill Fisher said. \"We started off the season playing hot defensively, and we've continued to do that, but our offense caught up - all three phases, we're playing well.\" \nThe game gives Seneca momentum heading into a huge showdown with Shawnee next week. \n\"We're peaking at the right time,\" Stahl said. \nWinslow 0 0 0 6 - 6 \nSeneca 14 7 7 7 - 35 \nS: Sam Jordan 8 run (Kevin Gsell kick) \nS: Gsell 5 pass from Scarpello (Gsell kick) \nS: Chris Stahl 7 pass from Scarpello (Gsell kick) \nS: Sam Pawlikowski 46 run (Gsell kick) \nS: Brett Barnes 39 pass from Scarpello (Gsell kick) \nW: Michael Cubbage 50 pass from Tyrae Taylor (kick failed)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:56:36.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
