The asteroid, named 2015 TB145, came as a surprise to the scientists, who spotted it less than two weeks ago. on.aol.com A massive skyscraper-sized asteroid will pass by the Earth on Halloween, moving at an unusually high rate of speed and coming relatively, if not frighteningly, close. And if the timing, speed, and distance from our homeward wasn't scary enough, the fact that this \"killer\" Halloween asteroid was discovered less than two weeks ago certainly is...\nNASA reported October 20 that asteroid 2015 TB145 will pass within 1.3 lunar distances (astronomical unit equal to the distance between the Earth and Moon), or just over 300,000 miles, of the Earth on Halloween, October 31. Reportedly between 320 and 640 meters in size, it is estimated to be some 28 times larger than the unexpected meteor that tore through and exploded in the Russian skies of Chelyabinsk in 2013. That particular bit of space rock detonated with the force of tens of nuclear bombs, its shockwave causing around 1,500 injuries and millions of dollars in damages. (The destructive parameters of asteroid 2015 TB145 are as yet undetermined. Such things are measured by calculating the mass of the object, its general make-up, the velocity at which it travels (over 78,000 miles per hour, noted by NASA as \"unusually high\"), and its potential angle of entry should it become a possible impactor.)\nNASA believes the Halloween asteroid to be cometary in nature, but are waiting for the fly-by to get better observational and technical data of the object. The space agency considers the asteroid hazardous due to its relatively close fly-by. In fact, NASA considers any near-Earth object passing within 4.6 million miles (0.5 astronomical units, or the distance between the Earth and the Sun) of our planet as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid, according to the Near Earth Object Program .\n2015 TB145 was discovered on October 10. It was detected by the Pan-STARRS I survey.\nNASA noted that the Halloween asteroid was also the closest object to do an Earth fly-by since 2006 when 2004 XP14 passed within 1.1 lunar distances. The next closest asteroid fly-by will not occur until August 2027 when 1999 AN10 will come within 1 lunar distance of our planet. However, it should be noted that Near Earth objects are being discovered all the time (some, like the Chelyabinsk meteor, at the most unexpected of times) and, just like asteroid 2015 TB145, are added to the growing catalog of objects. So, although the next scheduled close asteroid fly-by isn't until 1999 AN10's near-miss, there remains the potential for the discovery of other space objects that could do so prior to that asteroid's passing.\nAccording to Near Earth Object Program, which is part of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there are currently -- as of October 16, 2015 -- 13,256 known Near-Earth objects. Of these, 877 of these NEOs are asteroids with a diameter of approximately 1 kilometer or larger. Also, 1,635 have been classified as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.", "external_links": ["http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#howmany", "http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/2009FD/2009FD_planning.html", "http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/groups.html", "http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:41:06.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
