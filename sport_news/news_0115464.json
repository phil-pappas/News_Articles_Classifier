They (batsmen) need to give themselves a bit more time, and that was the reason to promote (Suresh) Raina. Everyone has scored runs in the series now, so that’s good going into the last match,” said Dhoni. “Virat batted exceedingly well and assessed the conditions well.” Cramping at the end of his 140-ball knock, Kohli was happy to score his 23rd ODI ton in a winning cause. “It always feels good when you get a century and the team wins ,” said the Test skipper. Kohli also praised de Villiers’ 112-run knock that made him uneasy in the dressing room. “I told him (de Villiers) that my heart was in my mouth when he was batting, he plays unbelievable shots. Credit goes to him, he fought it out.” De Villiers, too, had words of praise for Kohli. “It was a pretty tough wicket to play on and Virat assessed the conditions very well early on. The ball was turning quite a bit... Hopefully we’ll take some positives to Mumbai.” — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:37:25.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
