Bengals \"Red Zone\" offense vs. Seattle \"Red Zone\" defense \nThe Skinny: The Bengals rank sixth in the NFL in \"Red Zone\" touchdown percentage, having cashed in for TDs 13 of the 20 times they have driven inside the opponents 20-yard line, while Seattle's defense is tied for second in fewest \"Red Zone\" touchdowns allowed (three) and best percentage (37.5 percent). \nThe Bengals' \"Red Zone\" success is due in large part to the number of weapons they have. Running back Jeremy Hill has five \"Red Zone\" touchdowns; tight end Tyler Eifert has three; wide receiver A.J. Green has two; wide receiver Marvin Jones has one; running back Giovani Bernard has one and quarterback Andy Dalton has one on a scramble. \n4. Get to know the name Thomas Rawls, and can he keep streak alive? \nThe Skinny: Rawls is an undrafted rookie free agent running back from Central Michigan who may be the player charged with trying to keep the Seahawks franchise-best streak of 15 straight 100-yard rushing games alive. \nThat's because standout Marshawn Lynch was ruled out on Friday with a hamstring injury and top backup Fred Jackson is questionable with what is believed to be a high ankle sprain. \nRawls began his college career at Michigan and played three seasons (2010-12) where he rushed for just 333 career yards before transferring to Central Michigan and sitting out the 2013 season because of it. In his one season at Central Michigan he rushed for 1,103 yards and 10 touchdowns on 213 carries. \nHe was Seattle's main runner the past two games and after rushing for 104 yards on 16 carries two weeks ago against Chicago, he had 48 yards on 17 carries in Monday's 13-10 win over Detroit. \nThanks in part to having a running quarterback like Russell Wilson - and a back as good as Lynch - the Seahawks have rushed for over 100 yards in each of the last 15 regular-season games. \nThe Bengals held two of their first four opponents under 100 yards. \n3. Can the Bengals keep Jimmy Graham in check a second straight year? \nThe Skinny: Graham is off to a slow start in his first season in Seattle a year after the Bengals held him to just three receptions for 29 yards while he was playing for the New Orleans Saints. \nJust a few minutes into that game last season Bengals safety George Iloka was called for a personal foul penalty when he hit Graham well after a pass intended for him went incomplete. \nBengals head coach Marvin Lewis said after the game that the hit on Graham may have affected his performance the rest of that game. \n\"Unfortunately it cost us a penalty, but I think … it took a little bit out of him for the rest of the football game,\" said Lewis. \"He's obviously someone we wanted to get hands on every chance we get. He's such an effective receiver.\" \nHe hasn't been all that effective so far this season with 18 receptions for 174 yards and two touchdowns. That puts him on pace for 72 catches for 696 yards and eight touchdowns. The last four seasons in New Orleans he averaged 89 receptions for 1,099 yards and 11.5 touchdowns per season. \n\"I think there's more potential there,\" said Seattle coach Pete Carroll of Graham's performance so far. \"Jimmy's a fantastic player and he's been targeted quite a bit for us. We're expecting there's going to be some real big games for him as well as the consistent performance, too.\" \nQuarterback Russell Wilson also says he expects great things from Graham over time. \n\"He's just a really, really special player,\" said Wilson. \"You want to get him the football, but at the same time you have a lot of other great players. You just have to take what they give you and trust that, and when the time is right, he's going to capitalize on it more times than not. I'm looking forward to playing with Jimmy Graham for a long, long time.\" \nThe Bengals had great success limiting tight ends in the first four games of the season. \nIloka said staying physical with guys like the 6-foot-7, 260-pound Graham and New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski is key. \n\"Most of the better tight ends like Gronk and Jimmy, the bigger guys, you want to disrupt the route,\" said Iloka. \"They’re big and they can body you out at the top of the break. You might beat them at the top of the break, and they’ll body you out of the way. So obviously you want to disrupt the timing in the route. As much hands as you can get on him at the line within the 5-yard limit, you want to do that because it will throw off a lot of what they’re trying to do in terms of getting him the ball. Right out of the gate you want to try to knock the quarterback off his rhythm, knock a good receiver off his rhythm, running backs, too. Once they hit their stride and get the ball rolling and start feeling confident, it makes things twice as hard.\" \n2. Can the Bengals keep the heat on Wilson? \nThe Skinny: Despite his mobility Wilson has been sacked 18 times, which is tied for most of any quarterback in the league with Kansas City's Alex Smith. The Bengals sacked Smith five times last Sunday. \nWilson is on pace to get sacked 72 times this season, which would be tied for the second most in a season in NFL history. \nThe Seahawks lost the anchor to their recent lines in the offseason when they traded Max Unger to New Orleans for Graham. \n\"We're still growing, \" said Carroll. \"it's a young group of guys trying to figure it out and we've got to get better.\" \nSaid Wilson: “I think that we, just as a group, we need to keep battling together, keep learning. We’ll be OK. I think that’s the biggest thing. We’ve had some tough matchups the first four games or so and this is another one. Obviously the Bengals do a lot of great stuff and fly around. The key is getting the ball out on time, taking what they give us and capitalizing on opportunities.\" \n1. Will Andy Dalton break a 42-year-old NFL mark? \nThe Skinny: The Bengals quarterback has a chance to become the first quarterback since the new passer rating system was developed in 1973 to begin a season with five straight games with a rating of 115.0, but he'll be trying to do it against arguably the NFL's best secondary. \nThat secondary has gotten a lift, too, with the return of three-time Pro Bowl selection Kam Chancellor at strong safety . He sat out the first two games due to a contract holdout, but since he returned the Seattle defense hasn't allowed a touchdown and forced nine three-and-outs in 20 possessions. \nCarroll said Dalton will provide his defense, and especially the secondary, which is known as the \"Legion of Boom,\" with a challenge. \n\"He's been extremely consistent,\" said Carroll. \"He's been accurate with the ball. They give him a lot of chances to put the ball down the field and he's made a lot of big plays and his receivers have come through for him. They've had extraordinary protection, too. They've kept people off balance throughout. They're just off to a terrific start and look very difficult.\" \nPrediction: Bengals 20, Seahawks 16 \nThe Skinny: Despite Seattle being without Lynch and not having a potent offense to begin with, this game will be a grind for the Bengals. \nIt would surprising to see the Bengals have the same offensive success in this game that they had in the first four, but it would also be surprising to see Seattle hold that offense without a touchdown as it did the last two opponents. \nThe crowd should be wired, it should be a close game throughout and the Bengals will find a way to go to 5-0 for just the third time in franchise history (1975 and 1988 were the other two years). \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
