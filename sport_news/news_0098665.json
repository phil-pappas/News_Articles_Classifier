That is what happens with great teams on afternoons when, for long stretches, things aren’t going the way you drew them up.\nThe ability to weather unexpected storms without relenting and then finding some way to turn your frustration into patiently created opportunity is one of many things that separate the Patriots from their peers, assuming they have any, which at the moment appears debatable.\nCertainly the Dallas Cowboys were not, despite the defensive problems they created for a time by harassing quarterback Tom Brady until he began to flush himself out of the pocket without as much provocation as he was feeling. Regardless of the hounding of defensive end Greg Hardy (a player yesterday more interested in meeting Brady than meeting his wife or her sister), the passing game ultimately came together in the second half and the depleted Dallas offense could not keep up, losing 30-6 to the Patriots at AT&T Stadium.\nYet this was not as easy a victory as the scoreboard said but that is one reason the Patriots are considered the best team in the AFC and perhaps the best in football. Even on a bad day filled with struggle, they gave the Cowboys a spanking, so what might happen on a good one? The mind reels.\n“We made a lot of adjustments,” Brady said, the primary being finding ways to keep him upright after he was sacked five times in the first half. “I don’t think we practiced a lot of what they were doing. They used a few different fronts (he hadn’t seen) and some different coverages.”\nThat pressure and those coverages took tight end Rob Gronkowski away most of the day, limiting him to one reception in the first half. With his biggest and best weapon missing and Dallas’ pass rush preventing him from waiting for slower-developing plays to break open, Brady was under constant duress in the first half but that’s where the team aspect of things came into play.\nWith the offense averaging 39.3 points per game the first three weeks, playing defense had been only minimally necessary. Yesterday was different and the defense held the fort until halftime when adjustments were made that unloaded the ball quicker and often double-teamed Hardy.\n“On defense, we don’t really pay attention to what the offense does,” safety Devin McCourty said. “We know if we can get them the ball back they’ll put points on the board.”\nLeading 10-3 late in the second quarter, the defense did just that, forcing Dallas into a three-and-out that took only 19 seconds off the clock. It was punctuated by a second down sack of Dallas quarterback Brandon Weeden by defensive end Jabaal Sheard that pinned the Cowboys at their 5-yard line. When the defense stuffed the run on third down, it forced Dallas to punt and Brady got the ball back at his 45 with 53 seconds to play.\nHe didn’t do much with it but kicker Stephen Gostkowski’s 57-yard field goal provided a 13-3 halftime lead with the offense opening the second half with the ball. What they would do with it was, at that moment, unclear but complementary football had put Brady in position to create separation between his team and the scrappy but offensively depleted Cowboys.\nStarting from their 10-yard line, after the second of three penalties on receiver Julian Edelman opened the second half with a thud, Brady twice found Gronkowski for gains of 33 and 18 yards, his only significant plays of the day. They were enough to set up a 10-yard touchdown pass to shifty running back Dion Lewis, who snaked and slithered his way through four Dallas defenders to get into the end zone. Effectively, the game was over.\nAlthough Dallas continued to give the Patriots’ offense headaches, they were no longer migraines. They were more the kind you get from overwork, ones you can cope with without needing to go into a dark room.\nThat relief came in part because the defense allowed an 8:31 Cowboy drive after Lewis’ touchdown to die on the vine at their 5-yard line, forcing Dallas to settle for a meaningless field goal that made it 20-6, one of two times the Cowboys reached the red zone and left without a touchdown.\nSuch defensive heroics were necessary because the offense kept sputtering, finishing 3-for-10 on third down and being stuffed on its only fourth down try at Dallas’ 27 when running back LeGarrette Blount needed a yard and didn’t gain an inch.\nThat’s the kind of difficult day it was, the scoreboard telling a different story than the game had been. But with quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant both sidelined, Dallas didn’t have the most challenging contingent to put on the field and the Patriots’ defense knew it.\nThe defense understood Dallas had no deep speed, only a minimal running game and a quarterback in Weeden who has mastered throwing the checkdown but not much else besides incompletions.\nFearing little about the Dallas offense’s ability to get on top of them, the Patriots pressed the line of scrimmage, shut down Dallas’ only weapon, tight end Jason Witten, and kept everything in front of them. That absence of a looming threat allowed the Pats’ offense to muddle along until it finally figured out how to keep Hardy and linebacker Rolando McClain, both returning from four-game suspensions, under reasonable control.\nOnce the Pats did this, the points began to come despite the offense converting on just 30 percent of their third downs and looking far from the dominating machine they had been in the first three games. They won handily in the end on a day when Dallas’ scheme and new fronts with Hardy and McClain created no end of difficulties for Brady because the defense held the fort.\n“We won that game as a team,” Gronkowski said. “Our defense played really well and kept giving us opportunities. We had to make a lot of adjustments and just stay cool. You don’t want to panic. We stayed on the same page and in the second half we executed a little bit better, which we had to do.”\nIn the end, that’s how the Patriots won yesterday. They won by doing what they had to do, not all they could do, which is a reminder to the rest of the NFL that this is a team that doesn’t always need to be at its best to be better than you are.\nNow it’s on to Indianapolis and oh what a circus next week will be. As Bart Scott might say, “Can’t wait!”\nAfter yesterday, surely the Patriots and Tom Brady feel the same.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:59:24.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
