I just let the ball get out of my hands too much.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below LaFell spent the first seven weeks of the Patriots season on the physically unable to perform list after suffering a foot injury during training camp. And he looked rusty against the Jets.\n“I don’t think any of us really felt great about the way we performed today,” Bill Belichick said when asked about LaFell’s comments. “We can all do a better job, so I’m sure that everybody feels that way. I do, and I’m sure everybody else does. We just left too many plays on the field too often.”\nIt wasn’t all bad for the six-year veteran receiver in his first game of the season. LaFell hauled in a tough catch, where he tracked the ball after it was tipped, before being crushed by Jets safety Calvin Pryor.\nTom Brady was seen encouraging LaFell on the sideline with a slap on the back following LaFell’s sixth drop. Despite the erratic play from his receivers, Brady finished the day 34-of-54 for 355 yards and two touchdowns.\nBelichick yourself before you wreck yourself\nPrevious -- of -- Next 10. Drew Bledsoe: It’s not Bledsoe’s fault that his injury cost him his job in 2001, but Belichick set a precedent for doing what was best for the team, regardless of prior history, when he kept Tom Brady in the starting lineup after Bledose returned.
