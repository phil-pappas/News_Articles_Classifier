Not only did his favorite college football team — Notre Dame — take out Navy, but the 17-year-old Cache County resident watched them win at home in South Bend, Indiana, as well. \nJack has been a Fighting Irish fan since he was 10 years old. \n\"My brother-in-law went to school here at Notre Dame. He's just made me like Notre Dame,\" Jack said. \"I've always wanted to come here (to South Bend) and be on the field.\" –Patty Salmond, Jack's mother \n\"(It's) just sweet, just sweet,\" his mother, Patty Salmond, said wiping away tears. \"We're just really grateful.\" \nWith a little \"luck of the Irish\" — and some help from the Make-A-Wish Foundation — Jack was granted an all-access pass to The Joyce Center and Notre Dame Stadium. \n\"Jack was on the waiting list. He did not want to change, didn't want to go to Disney World,\" Patty said. \"He said, 'Nope. I'm staying on the list, and I want to come (to Notre Dame).'\" \n\"It was really cool to have him here,\" Jack said. \"When I first saw him, I was like, 'Whoa! You're still here?'\" \nBrooks even took Jack onto the football field before the magic moment he'd been waiting for: his first Notre Dame football game. \n\"He's watched on his iPad; he watches pep rallies; he watches team meetings; he watches everything,\" his mother said. \"So he's excited to just be here.\" \nDave McCann \n\n@KSLKat .
