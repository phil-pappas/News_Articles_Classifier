The victory marked South Dakota’s first win in Fargo since 1978 and snapped the Bison’s MVFC-record 26-game home win streak. \nSaeger accounted for all three touchdowns in Saturday’s victory. He passed for 202 yards and ran for 92 more. Against the top third-down defense in the nation, Saeger completed eight of them, including six with his legs and two with his arm. Saeger led the Coyotes on a 15-play, 72-yard touchdown drive that tied the game at 21-all with 4:47 remaining. He quarterbacked the 55-yard drive that setup the game-winning score. \nSaeger threw two 8-yard touchdown passes and snuck in from a yard award for a third score. His 202 yards passing were three shy of his career high. \nBergner made a game-winning 33-yard field goal as time expired that gave the Coyotes the victory. He also averaged a career-best 49 yards on four punts and had a season-long of 61 yards. In addition, Bergner had two touchbacks on four kickoffs. This is the fourth time Berger has earned the weekly award. \nSouth Dakota (3-3, 1-2 MVFC) returns to Vermillion and will host Missouri State (1-5, 0-3) at 2 p.m. Saturday inside the DakotaDome. © 2015 Associated Press.
