Spartan tennis places 5th in 2nd home meet in 3 days By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com   \nJust two days after hosting a home meet, the Emporia High girls’ tennis team was back at it again on its home court Monday. The result, a fifth-place finish as a team, wasn’t quite as encouraging as the Spartans’ runner-up outing two days before. \n“Honestly, the girls would probably agree with me that we struggled a little bit,” EHS head coach Melinda Flohr said. “I don’t know if it was that we had a meet on Saturday and it was a quick turnaround without a practice, or it’s homecoming week so there’s a lot of distractions, but I think the girls would probably tell you too that they didn’t play their best tennis. \n“We still saw some good things from them, but we definitely have some things we need to get turned around before next Monday (for league).” \nEmporia was also without its top player in Ashley DeBauge, who was playing at the Centennial League golf meet in Topeka, where she placed 11th. \nEmporia’s 16 points beat only Topeka High, with Washburn Rural and Olathe South tying for first at 36 points. \n“I think all of them it seemed lacked some energy today,” Flohr said, “and some aggressiveness going after shots.” \nThe Spartans’ top finish came from their doubles team of Kathryn Kienholz and Chelsea Herrarte. The two finished sixth with a 1-2 record that included a first round bye. \nIn singles, Mazie Kolterman, who also got a first round bye, finished eighth. She went 0-3 on the day but was within three games or less in each of her matches. \n“Mazie’s worked hard. She worked hard in the summer and came out and hit a lot during the summer,” Flohr said. “She has been improving as the season’s gone on. She has been getting more and more confident and able to incorporate some new shots into her game that she didn’t have before.” \nEmporia’s other doubles team of Melissa Benjamin and Gali Perez finished 10th, picking up an 8-0 win over a pair from Topeka High. Maddy Young stepped into the Spartans’ second singles position, going 0-2. \nFlohr said Monday’s lineup, with the exception DeBauge returning, likely would carry over into next week’s Centennial League meet in Topeka. \n“I think especially for league, we’re pretty set on these doubles combinations,” she said. “But who knows, we’ll see as the week goes on. I’m not ruling out the possibility of some changes.” \nDeBauge, who cruised to a singles title in last Saturday’s home meet, will be key in the Spartans’ final meet before regionals, and Flohr said she wasn’t concerned with her top player going more than a week between competitions. \n“Ashley works really hard at her game, so she’s going to be fine,” Flohr said. “She’ll probably take a few lessons between now and league to make sure that her skills are at her prime and she’ll be fine.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:26:15.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
