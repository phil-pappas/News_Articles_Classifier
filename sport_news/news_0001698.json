It really is.\nHow did you find out?\nIt’s funny, because I think it was from Dri (Canadian teammate Adriana Leon). We have a Canadian group message. She was like, ‘Congrats,’ and a couple of the other players started saying, ‘Congrats.’ I didn’t know for what.\nThis was very early, I just woke up, was about to go to class. I always get that ‘Congrats’ text before I actually know what I got. It’s kind of like a routine; when someone says, ‘Congrats’ I just go on Twitter and check.\nSo I went on Twitter and checked and I just said, ‘Wow.’ It was like a blank stare. I was like, ‘Is this really real?’ I’m like, ‘This is too early for this; are my eyes still blurry or something?’ I just couldn’t believe what it said.\nWere you surprised to see your name on that list?\nReally, really surprised that I was on the list, let alone the only defender. There are so many other great defenders out there! I was like, ‘This is crazy. Who made this list? This list is not right.’ People were like ‘Yeah, you deserve it,’ but it was crazy just to see my name there.\nWhat do you think of the other players on the list? You’re included with some of the best names in women’s soccer.\nIt’s no surprise that they’re on the list! I’m like, (acts like she’s scrolling through the list) ‘Yeah, yeah, perfect.’ Then you see my name and its like, ‘OK?’ They all deserve the award.\nDo you have any expectations with this nomination?\nIt’s a tough one. Just being on the short slist alone is pretty huge for me. Expectation of winning it? Probably not. But I’m proud of myself being on that list with all of these great players.\nThis article is edited for length and clarity.\nArsenal surprises Bayern Munich to keep Champions campaign alive", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:41:02.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
