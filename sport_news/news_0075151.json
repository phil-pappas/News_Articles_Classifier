(WZZM) -- The Ferris State Bulldogs have been a team of dominance. They have built a 5-0 start this season, with the credit a lot of credit going to one incredibly fast quarterback. \nJason Vander Laan has rushed for 646 yards in just five games this season, and is within reach of setting a new record. \nLast season, Jason Vander Laan set many records for the Ferris State Bulldogs. \n\"Let's put it this way, he's made me a pretty good coach for four years,\" said head coach, Tony Annese. \nVander Laan has been named a Harlon Hill Award winner and a NCAA Division II Scholar Athlete of the Year. Now, fast forward to this season, and he's on the verge of writing his name in the history books again. \nDuring his career, the senior quarterback has rushed for more than 5,000 yards, and is just 71 yards shy of becoming the greatest rushing quarterback in college football, at any NCAA level. A title currently held by Wofford's Shawn Graves set back from 1989-1992. \n\"Its been building up for a little while but we have got five more games for the rest of the year. I'm not too worried about it,\" said Vander Laan. \n\"History is a long time, and there has been a lot of quarterbacks in college football,\" said Annese. \"There will be some people kind of watching the stats to see if he gets those yards.\" \nAnd just like any quarterback class-act, if you ask Vander Laan about his success, he will credit the men in front of him. \n\"They probably have the hardest practice everyday because they are always banging heads all day.I just can't be any more grateful to have those guys out there working as hard as they can to give other people the credit.\" \n\"When it's all said and done, you know those O-lineman are going to feel great about being a part of that,\" said Annese. \nThe sidelines of Saturdays game, will be some sort of a reunion. Annese said, \" We have invited some guys back who blocked for him when he was a red-shirt freshman, sophomore and junior.\" \nSo, with the whole team past and present in attendance, the Bulldogs hope to celebrate a little piece of history. \nSaturday's game is not only an opportunity for history, but a chance for a rematch, as the Bulldogs will face Ohio Dominican at noon.
