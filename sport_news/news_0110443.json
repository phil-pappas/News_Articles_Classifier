Image 10 of 10 Maple Hill, Cambridge win soccer titles at Maple Hill's tournament 1 / 10 Back to Gallery Castleton\nBryan Kern , after scurrying to corral the ball in the waning seconds of the first half to get off a corner kick, made a quick glance across the field. Garrett Axtmann received the message.\nKern lofted it into the box and Axtmann, Maple Hills' standout junior striker, leaped high and headed in the corner cross with six seconds left before halftime.\nThe Wildcats proceeded to dominate the second half and registered a 1-0 victory against Galway in the title game of the Maple Hill Fall Sports Weekend Tournament.\nIn the girls' championship game, Cambridge sophomore standout Miranda Seacord tallied three goals — two in the final 10:17 — to propel the Indians to a 3-2 triumph over Maple Hill.\nAxtmann's team-high 17th goal of the season, after outleaping Galway senior defender Antoine Comissiong , helped earn the junior the event's Most Outstanding Offensive Player award.\n\"That was a really sweet goal,\" Axtmann said. \"I was surprised because (Comissiong) is like 6-foot-1 and I'm only 5-9. I am shocked I actually got over him.\"\n\"That was a great feed from Kern,\" Maple Hill coach Dan Gillespie said. \"Kern is a very good athlete. How about Axtmann going up and getting that one? An excellent finish.\"\nThe Wildcats (14-0) showed once again they know how to polish off opponents, having outscored their foes 53-2.\nMaple Hill (14-0), the state's top-ranked Class C squad and winner of 22 Section II titles, captured its third straight 1-0 win after previously edging Cambridge (a goal by Axtmann) Saturday in the opening round and also defeating Patroon Conference foe Greenville on Wednesday.\n\"The last three years, we haven't won the Patroon Conference and we haven't won a sectional title,\" Axtmann said. \"We're trying to get the tradition back on track. We want to keep winning.\"\nGalway (11-2-1) did not advance past midfield against Maple Hill in the second half through the first 18 minutes. Even when they did move forward, the Eagles rarely challenged senior goalie George Roe . The senior defensive trio of Aidan Carney , Reny Hoffman and Brendon Gerrain, as usual, kept Roe's workload light.\n\"From the back up, we're strong,\" Axtmann said. \"When the ball gets on our third, the defense can bring it out consistently. We get into offense quickly.\"\n\"We have pretty good balance. Our defenders aren't just defenders. They're offensive too,\" Gillespie said. \"Reny Hoffman came up hard. He played well.\"\nGalway's best scoring chance in the second half came when Comissiong, the Most Outstanding Defensive Player of the tournament, whistled a direct kick just over the crossbar.\n\"I thought we played better than we did (Saturday),\" Gillespie said. \"We possessed quite well and moved it well. \"Galway is a very good team.\"\nIn the girls' final, Cambridge (10-4) led Maple Hill (7-7-1) at intermission as Seacord opened the scoring with 10:31 left. The speedy sophomore dashed down the middle and rifled a shot into the left corner past goalie Amanda Papas .\nMaple Hill senior striker Lauryn Krupa tallied her 19th and 20th goals of the season to provide the Wildcats a 2-1 advantage. The first goal came when Krupa made a steal and dashed in. The second tally resulted after turning and blasting a lefty shot inside the right post.\nThe Wildcats tried to prevent Seacord's sprints down the field. After the sophomore tied it at 2 with 10:17 left, she collected her first hat trick of the season by storming through the defense to blast home a loose ball with 3:35 remaining.\n\"This win feels really good. It got a little sketchy,\" Seacord said. \"Getting the (hat trick) is awesome. I didn't think I was going to do it. Everyone was kicking at it and I just finished it.\"\njallen@timesunion.com • 518-454-5062 • @TUSidelines", "external_links": ["http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781185/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781185/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781185/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781194/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781190/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781187/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/65/8781183/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781192/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/65/8781183/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781189/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781194/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781194/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781187/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781189/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781190/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781193/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781193/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/65/8781183/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781186/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781186/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781190/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781192/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781193/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781189/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781187/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781192/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/66/8781186/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:28:26.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
