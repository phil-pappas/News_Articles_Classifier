My teams must play at full throttle and take it to the limit every single game. It is important to have a playing philosophy that reflects your own mentality, reflects the club and gives you a clear direction to follow. Tactical of course, but tactical with a big heart. \n“Liverpool has extraordinary supporters and Anfield is a world renowned home, with an incredible atmosphere. I want to build a great relationship with these supporters and give them memories to cherish.” \nKlopp has been joined at Liverpool by Zeljko Buvac and Peter Krawietz, his former assistants at Dortmund. \nIn an impressive first news conference later, Klopp told a packed audience at Anfield that he wanted a positive approach on and off the pitch, to “turn doubters into believers”. \nWell aware that Liverpool has not won the league for 25 years, the new man said he did not want history to become a burden and that he was not prepared to promise immediate success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:27.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
