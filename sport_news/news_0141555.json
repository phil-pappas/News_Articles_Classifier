And with her part-time income of $7.25 an hour for 20 hours a week, Ellis-Johnson doesn't make enough to find another place.\nMore than 7.5 million part-time American workers are older than 50, and for most of them, 4 out of 5, part-time work is a choice - with income as a motivator, but also job satisfaction and a desire to stay connected to the work world.\nBut 1 in 5 find themselves in a situation similar to Ellis-Johnson's, concludes a recent study by Rutgers University's John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development in New Brunswick, N.J.\n\"The number of people struggling has remained high,\" said Heldrich Center director Carl Van Horn, coauthor of The Joys and Disappointments of Older Part-time Workers.\nIn June, the center released a report on part-time workers because, \"in the aftermath of the great recession, what remained high was the number of involuntary part-time workers,\" even as the job market grew, Van Horn said.\nInvoluntary part-time workers would like to work full time, but can't because business is slow, they can't find a full-time job, or they have seasonal work.\nIn September, the center focused the research on older workers, age 50 and up, combining an analysis of U.S. Labor Department employment statistics with results of a survey of workers conducted in the spring.\nVan Horn said that although younger workers \"tend to be laid off more quickly due to lack of seniority and lack of experience, it's easier for them to get back to the labor market.\"\n\"Older workers, if they are in the unemployed population, it's harder for them to get back into the labor market,\" he said. So many of them turn to part-time work.\nThere are other differences, as well. Voluntary part-time workers tend to be older, white, better-educated, female, and married or living with a partner, the research showed. Many of them, Van Horn said, are satisfied with their work and enjoy the companionship and connection with coworkers.\nWhile money is absolutely a factor in their decision to continue to work instead of retiring, they also are using their paychecks to supplement their Social Security, pension, and savings, he said.\nThat's how Doris Langford, 77, of Havertown, describes her decision to keep on working. Twelve years ago, at 65, she tried to retire from her full-time job as a receptionist at Bala Consulting Engineers in King of Prussia. It didn't last. She missed the company, and the company missed her.\nSo Langford works every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. \"I love my job, and people treat me with such love and respect,\" she said. \"I have no plans of retiring.\"\nOn the job, she still contributes to Social Security and a 401(k) plan, which she hasn't touched, and she has health insurance through the company.\nShe would have enough, barely, she said, to support herself and stay home without working, but there would be no money for extras.\nVan Horn said the involuntary part-time workers experience a much different reality. More are minorities. They are less educated. The largest group has annual household incomes of less than $30,000. More are widowed, divorced, separated, or single.\nThey have high credit-card debt, and rely more on food stamps and other forms of public support, Heldrich's study shows.\nEllis-Johnson could check all of those boxes. She graduated in June 2014 with $62,000 in student loans accrued while earning an associate's degree in business administration at Peirce College in Philadelphia.\nShe is also on food stamps.\n\"The house I live in is dilapidated. When it rains, it showers in my bedroom,\" she said.\nEllis-Johnson had been working full time until she moved from North Carolina to Philadelphia to be nearer to grandchildren.\nUnfortunately, she chose 2010 - the worst year for job loss from the recession.\n\"When I got up here, I had no idea how bad it was,\" she said. \"I couldn't get a job anywhere.\"\nNow she has a part-time job at the National Asian Pacific Center on Aging, where she is a job development assistant working in Center City for its outpost at CareerLink, the state-funded employment and job search office.\nEllis-Johnson may be getting the full-time job soon. An interview last week went well, and there is a better-than-\naverage chance that, by Nov. 1, she'll be working as an intake worker, helping people on welfare with career aspirations.\nHer part-time work, she said, is rewarding - at least emotionally.\nHer eyes shining with pride, Ellis-Johnson described how she encouraged one jobless client to persist despite the despair. When he finally landed a job, he insisted on visiting her to tell her the good news.\n\"I love it. That's the part that is so satisfying,\" she said. \"I understand the struggle.\"\njvonbergen@phillynews.com\n215-854-2769\n@JaneVonBergen\nwww.philly.com/jobbing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:26:26.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
