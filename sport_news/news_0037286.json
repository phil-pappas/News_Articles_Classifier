We must protect UEFA,\" he told the Die Zeit newspaper.\nThe 60-year-old Platini denies any wrongdoing. He describes the charges as \"farcical\" and is appealing his suspension.\nHours before UEFA's meeting began Prince Ali bin al Hussein, Platini's main rival to succeed Blatter, formally registered his candidacy for next year's election to run world football's scandal-hit governing body.\nIn Zurich, FIFA's acting president Issa Hayatou arrived at the world body's headquarters for his first day in his new job.\n\"Mr Hayatou arrived this morning at FIFA's headquarters,\" a spokesperson confirmed.\nThe 69-year-old Cameroonian's first major task will be to establish the topics for FIFA's own crisis meeting scheduled for Tuesday.\nA Swiss bank, Julius Baer, meanwhile announced it was suing newspaper Handelszeitung over an article implicating it in the corruption scandal.\n @AO_Sports and on Facebook at ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:37:41.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
