The board will find all new contractors to complete the second phase of a $23 million bond measure after nearly signing off on a set of potential illegal contracts last week. The construction will include work on a new track and field and the cafeteria. The backstep should not affect completing the projects on target, with the track and field set for graduation 2016 and the cafeteria by August 2016, Superintendent Pat Chabot said. The delayed start also has the added bonus of delaying interruption of the football season with work on field, Chabot said. At an Oct. 6 meeting, the board scrapped an agenda item to approve close to $1 million in contracts at the last minute when notified eight out 14 were in violation of state labor laws. WLC Architects Inc., the firm overseeing construction at the school, had failed to properly record contractor’s license numbers. The company did not ask for licenses in writing within 24-hours, as required by state law, and instead just went to the Contractors State License Board website to verify it, WLC Architects, Inc. Principal Paul Bonaccorsi said Wednesday. “I’ve never been called on that in 15 years of business,” he said. WLC will cover all costs associated with putting the project out to rebid, which in print advertising alone could be between $10,000 to $15,000, Bonaccorsi said. The new ads should run Saturday, said Kim Burr, chief finance officer. And Bonaccorsi said the process won't raise his company’s costs significantly. Prior to the misstep last week, the company had already advised the district to re-advertise several contracts due to a change in state regulations. Since specifics for the construction were written in December 2013, the Department of Industrial Relations has updated its requirements, Bonaccorsi said. “We’re updating all specifics to meet the most current legislation so nothing like this happens again in this or the final phase,” he said. Public works, like those funded with school bonds, carry different requirements than residential or commercial construction. Regardless, if WLC Architects manages the paperwork, individual contractors fill out the initial documents, and should know the requirements, said Michelle Tucker of Construction Industry Force Account Council. Tucker was among those to point out the mistake last week and is also the parent of a Sonora High student. As a member of the district paying off the bond, Tucker said she wants to ensure the projects are performed by the most qualified contractors possible.
