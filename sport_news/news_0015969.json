(Photo: AJ Mast/Associated Press) \nAs they prepare for their Sunday night matchup against the Patriots at Lucas Oil Stadium, the Colts find themselves mired in a six-game losing streak against New England. The last time Indianapolis won a game between the two teams was Nov. 15, 2009, a 35-34 home victory. In the six games since – regular season and postseason – the Colts have been outscored by their nemesis 251-125. \nIt wasn't long ago that the Colts were in a similar situation: From 2001-05, Indianapolis was 0-6 against New England. But over their next six contests against the Patriots, the Colts won five times. \nJeff Saturday was Indianapolis' starting center through both the slump and the hot streak against New England, witnessing firsthand the transformation of the Colts from perennial Patriots prey to consistent winner in head-to-head showdowns. \n\"I think execution was the biggest key,\" Saturday told The Star about what enabled the Colts to overcome the Patriots on a regular basis. \"You begin to realize it's not gonna be plays called, it's not gonna be gadgets, it's not gonna be any kind of trickery. It's just gonna be basic, fundamental football. It's understanding that the Patriots are going to be what they are. Understanding all of those things, that it was technically sound football, that's what got us over the edge.\" \nThe Colts-Patriots dynamic today isn't what it once was . During the span in which Indianapolis won five of six against New England, the average margin of victory for either team was 6 points. Peyton Manning versus Tom Brady was the premier quarterback rivalry in the NFL, and any contest between their respective teams was a marquee event. \nSince the dawn of the Andrew Luck Era in Indianapolis, it's been a one-sided affair, with the Patriots scoring an average of 47 points over four games, all New England victories. Insider: Luck not alone in taking lumps against Patriots \nBefore this season began, the Colts were hyped as legitimate Super Bowl contenders and considered a threat to the Patriots' supremacy in the AFC. Five weeks into the season, however, the Colts are 3-2 (starting 0-2 then winning three consecutive games against AFC South opponents) with an injured starting quarterback who may not play Sunday. Meanwhile, the Patriots have steamrolled all comers en route to a 4-0 start. \nWhat happened? \n\"I think continuity definitely plays a large role,\" Saturday said of the Colts' troubles in 2015. \"You have guys playing next to each other for a large amount of a season and all of that goes toward consistency on the field. So I think you have to look for that. As I look back, I think the Colts already changed their offensive line in Week 3 (at Tennessee); I mean, that's tough to do. It's tough to move around all the time. It's not just pieces and parts; you've got to develop a relationship and a comfort level with the guy you're playing beside. And I think that just takes time.\" \nIt took time for the 2009 Colts, a team with core personnel that meshed over several seasons. With Manning leading the way, players such as Saturday, wide receiver Reggie Wayne, running back Joseph Addai, tight end Dallas Clark, defensive ends Robert Mathis and Dwight Freeney, and defensive back Antoine Bethea had all been together for four to 12 seasons. \nContrast that with the 2015 Colts, a team that has so many key positions filled with newcomers or players who haven't been with the franchise long: Wide receiver Andre Johnson, running back Frank Gore and several members of the the offensive line haven't had much time to gain the familiarity and continuity Saturday enjoyed. \nAnd while Saturday remembers a lot of hype surrounding the '09 Colts heading into that season, the circumstances were different. \n\"That was the year Tony Dungy had left, and Marvin (Harrison) had just left, and that was the year I believe Peyton and I were on the cover of ESPN the Magazine ,\" Saturday recalled. \"You know, 'What will this team be like without those two guys?' But we knew in our locker room where we were. And we knew as a team the type of talent that we had and we legitimately knew we could play for (the Super Bowl). \n\"But understand, where we had come from a few years before with a Super Bowl win, our expectations were different. It was: Look, we need to win the Super Bowl. It wasn't, well we'll make a good showing against teams. This was: We need to go get this next ring.\" \nWhen the Colts met New England that November, they were 8-0. The Patriots were 6-2. The win was the Colts' 17th straight regular season victory dating back to the previous year, and Indianapolis wouldn't lose until Week 16 against the Jets while resting several players. The Colts were an established juggernaut behind Manning. The 2015 Colts have yet to forge such an identity. \n\"Some of the things, you can't force,\" Saturday said. \"Bringing in Andre Johnson, bringing in Frank Gore, bringing in Todd Herremans, when you begin to bring guys in like this, it takes time regardless of what plays you're calling. You have to get acquainted with guys, how guys come out of the break, how guys beat this block, all of those things take time. That doesn't just mesh together. \n\"So I think the expectations going into the year were probably a little much on what they would do.\" \nWith the Deflategate saga stemming from last season's AFC Championship game in Foxborough, and the Patriots knocking the Colts out of the playoffs each of the last two seasons, the anticipation for Week 6 on the Colts' schedule soared. But now that Week 6 is upon the two teams, Saturday says the focus for the Colts in their current state should be singular. \n\"This is a team that should still clearly win the division,\" Saturday said of the Colts. \"They're going to go to the playoffs. It's just a matter of, can they match up with the best in the AFC. And you'll see, come this weekend, how do you stand up against the top of the AFC right now?\" \nIf the Patriots continue to leave wreckage in their wake and defeat the Colts soundly Sunday, Saturday said that won't necessarily spell doom for Indianapolis going forward. \n\"Regardless of what happens Sunday night, you're still in contention to win your division.\" he said. \"The Colts have to get better as the Colts. This has nothing to do with the Patriots, Broncos, whoever else you want to stack in there. This is about, in Week 17, how much better are the Colts gonna be than this week? \n\"We'll have to see how it progresses. Make no mistake: Sunday's game doesn't win the Super Bowl. However the Colts look, if they continue to progress and get better as the year goes on and something happens to the Patriots and they don't, you don't count anybody out.\" \nFrom the other side of things, the Patriots are coming to Indianapolis with the league's leading offense and quarterback Tom Brady on pace for a career year at age 38. Could he and his team be seeking revenge for DeflateGate in the form of a blowout win against Indianapolis on national television? \n\"Look, Tom Brady, I've played him a bunch of times,\" Saturday said. \"This is a competitive, tough football player. I think Tom Brady is much more concerned about his legacy with how he plays, than he is with whether (general manager) Ryan Grigson and the Colts turned him in or whatever. From Brady's perspective, what is the anger? The Patriots beat the Colts 45-7 (in the AFC title game). So if they beat them 50-7, what does that really do? \n\"Tom Brady's worried about the trophy at the end of the year, not just one football game.\" \nSeveral players on the Colts have said all week that Sunday's game is a big game \"because it's the next game.\" But is that really how they view the contest? \n\"I think it's bigger than that from the standpoint that you're gonna play a good football team,\" Saturday said. \"You're playing a team that you know will be in the playoffs unless something happens like an injury. And this is how you evaluate where you are in your season. \n\"It's not just another game. It's: how do we fare against the best in the AFC?\" 65 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1RMG3Gz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:48:12.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
