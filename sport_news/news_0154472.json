He'll be more actively involved as the starting quarterback against the Tigers at Memorial Stadium. \"The best way of quieting a crowd down is making big plays, and I got to experience that last year against Florida State where every time we got some momentum going, it wasn't as hard to communicate,\" Kizer said. The No. 6 Irish (4-0) feature one of the top wide receivers in the country in Will Fuller, who has 454 yards receiving and six touchdowns. \"Will's going to have to be able to shake off some aggressive man-to-man coverage,\" Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. Twelfth-ranked Clemson (3-0) has one of the top cornerbacks in Mackensie Alexander. The opposition tends to avoid throwing in his direction. Notre Dame is taking a different approach. \"I'm going to throw the ball to the first read that's open,\" Kizer said. \"If it's on his side, it's going to go that way. If it (means) getting away from him because he's playing good defense, then go to the back side and try to find the next open man.\"\n— LaMond Pope\nValparaiso at Davidson\nWhen: 12 p.m. Saturday, WVUR-FM (95.1 FM), ValpoAthletics.com\nOutlook: Both teams enter with 0-3 records. Valparaiso was limited to 18 yards rushing in last week's 38-6 loss to San Diego in the Pioneer Football League opener. Davidson started PFL play with a 34-0 loss to Morehead State. Running back Jeffrey Keil is Davidson's most productive with 189 rushing yards. Quarterbacks John Cook and Taylor Mitchell have combined to go 32-for-78 with seven interceptions and one touchdown. Valparaiso center Nate Koeneman (back) and right guard Kyle Jones (concussion) are questionable. Defensive lineman Michael Buchanan is doubtful after suffering a bruised knee against San Diego. Cornerback A.J. Bradley is expected to return after missing last week's game with a leg injury. Ryan Clarke will start at quarterback for the Crusaders. Scott Staal (concussion) has been cleared to play, while Dalton Stokes is out with a right shoulder injury. Frank Catrine is Valparaiso's leading receiver with 10 receptions for 95 yards. Crusaders coach Dave Cecchini said Catrine is \"very talented with great hands.\" He also raved about the progress of freshman Jean Rene at slot receiver.\nNotre Dame receiver Chris Brown ready for 'business trip' to Clemson LaMond Pope SOUTH BEND — Chris Brown's high school is about three hours from Clemson.\nBut the Notre Dame receiver did not root for the Tigers when he was younger.\n\"I grew up a Florida fan and I developed into a South Carolina Gamecocks' fan,\" Brown said after Wednesday's practice.\nBrown played high school...\nSOUTH BEND — Chris Brown's high school is about three hours from Clemson.\nBut the Notre Dame receiver did not root for the Tigers when he was younger.\n\"I grew up a Florida fan and I developed into a South Carolina Gamecocks' fan,\" Brown said after Wednesday's practice.\nBrown played high school...\n(LaMond Pope) — Brandon Vickrey\nPurdue at Michigan State\nWhen: 11 a.m. Saturday, ESPN2, WJOB-AM (1230).\nOutlook: At 1-3, Purdue is the only team in the Big Ten below .500 after four games as Boilermakers travel to No. 2 Michigan State (4-0). After David Blough's strong starting debut against Bowling Green's forgiving defense, the degree of difficulty increases dramatically for the redshirt freshman quarterback. Defensive end Shilique Calhoun is a force for the Spartans, and linebacker Riley Bullough leads the conference in tackles. The Boilermakers have to be prepared for Michigan State's power running game. Connor Cook has completed 61-of-105 passes for 838 yards with nine touchdowns and one interception. The senior quarterback has 27 wins as the starter, tied with Kirk Cousins for the school record, and could be the No. 1 overall pick in next year's NFL Draft. Aaron Burbridge has been Michigan State's go-to receiver with 24 catches for 405 yards and four TDs. The Spartans have scored at least 30 points in 12 straight games but are banged up, including left tackle Jack Conklin's left knee injury. Boilermakers have lost six straight in the series, though they hung in both previous games under Darrell Hazell (45-31 last season,14-0 in 2013 in East Lansing).\n— Michael Osipoff\nOhio State at Indiana\nWhen: 2:30 p.m. Saturday, ABC, WJOB-AM (1230).\nOutlook: There's a buzz surrounding this game, expected to be a sellout, and why not? Top-ranked and defending national champion Ohio State (4-0) comes to Bloomington, bringing along a number of streaks — 17 straight wins, 14 straight road wins and 24 straight regular-season Big Ten wins. Indiana is 4-0 for the first time since 1990. Both teams are undefeated for their matchup for the first time since 1942, when each was 1-0. The Hoosiers' prolific offense is tops in the conference in scoring (38.3 points) and yards (522.3), but will be put to the test. Jordan Howard leads nation with 675 yards rushing, and is second with an average of 168.8 per game. Ricky Jones leads the conference with 411 yards receiving, on 18 catches with three TDs. Buckeyes have elite skill-position players, of course, including quarterback Cardale Jones and running back Ezekiel Elliott. Hoosiers last defeated Ohio State in 1988, with Buckeyes winning 20 straight in the series in going 21-0-1. Indiana is 0-15 all-time against No. 1 teams, including 0-5 against Ohio State.\n— Michael Osipoff\nCopyright © 2015, Post-Tribune Notre Dame Fighting Irish Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dc08e/turbine/ct-ptb-football-notre-dame-chris-brown-st-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:24:43.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
