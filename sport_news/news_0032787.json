The Oct. 3 matchup against Michigan that was scheduled to be a prime-time kickoff was moved to noon because of impending inclement weather from Hurricane Joaquin. \nThe game will be the first for Maryland after coach Randy Edsall was fired and offensive coordinator Mike Locksley's first as interim coach. It will be Locksley's first game serving as a team's head coach since his final game at New Mexico on Sept. 24, 2011. \nPenn State has won five straight games after losing its season opener to Temple. The Nittany Lions play at No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday night in an effort to clinch bowl eligibility and pull off a major upset. Maryland is 2-4 after Saturday's loss to the Buckeyes but will have a bye week to prepare for the matchup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:25:37.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
