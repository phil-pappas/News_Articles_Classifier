It was a tough night for the team that typically wears orange and black as Plainwell picked up a 25-12, 25-18, 25-15 victory. Sturgis could never really get its footing in the match. Even when the Lady Trojans would begin to piece together a run it was stopped by Plainwell. The lack of rhythm caused Sturgis to be a bit slow defensively, which Plainwell took advantage of on the floor. Brianna Wheeler handed out 14 assists, adding six digs as well. Paige Robinson led with six kills, adding one dig and one block while HannahBronstetter had five kills, one block and two digs. Harmony Groves led Sturgis with 12 digs in the match, Kayla Nichols had two while Morgan Pueschel added six. Paige Andrews logged eight digs, Lexi Mazzoni had two. Andrews collected a pair of kills as well. Nikki Nelson had one block and one kill. Three Rivers falls The Three Rivers volleyball team dropped a five-set match toEdwardsburg on Thursday night. “We’re playing hard,”Wildcat coach ErikKore said. “But our lack of offensive firepower is a liability. Still, I tip my hat to the girls for having the grit to extend the match all the way to five sets.” Edwardsburg won 25-20, 25-22, 21-25, 23-25 and 15-11. “We were down 0-2, but battled back to even the match, only to come up a little short in the fifth set,” Kore said. Megan Southland led with 19 kills on the night, adding 25 digs as well. Zoey Wilson and Shelby Krawczak combined for 12 kills while Tessa Hawkins added 42 digs. Hannah Orzol, Abby Springer and Southland each had three blocks on the evening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:53:48.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
