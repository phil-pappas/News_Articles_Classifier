But they had some players step up and still managed 243 yards of offense, 233 on the ground. They were outscored just 21-19 in the second half. \nLeading rusher Jacob Conrad again led the Berries with 95 yards rushing on 22 carries and two touchdowns. Dusten Wilson broke a 61-yard run. Tate Gaby added 47 yards rushing on just three carries. Jamie Babcock had an 85-yard kickoff return that Conrad later converted into a touchdown. Conrad added a 39-yard TD run to cap off the scoring for the Berries late in the third quarter. \nLogan opened the second half with an onside kick by Codi Hopper that was recovered by David Caudillo. That later turned into a 1-yard TD run by Ryan Bullard to get the Berries on the board. \nCaudillo also recovered a fumble caused by a strip-sack by James Aho in the first half that gave the Berries good field possession. But they turned the ball over on the ensuing possession, one of their five turnovers for the game. \nSpeedy Trenton Bonner led the Lions with 178 yards rushing and two touchdowns on just eight carries. \nThe Berries have struggled defensively all season but they saw a glimpse of the future when freshmen Tucker Platt and Jake Urban combined for a series of tackles to stop a Leo drive on downs in the third quarter. Urban also nearly had a pick 6 after he tipped a pass early in the contest on a drive the Lions later turned into a touchdown. Platt forced a fumble that Leo’s 6-foot-4, 343-pound offensive lineman JuJuan Allen picked up and rumbled 25 yards for a touchdown. \nLeo hosts Fort Wayne South for a semifinal game last week. South beat Marion 38-12 Friday night. \nWinamac 34, Manchester 0 \nClass 2A No. 7 Winamac (8-2) rolled up 585 yards of offense including 512 on the ground while at the same time pitching a shutout of Manchester (2-8). \nMatt Shorter rushed for 219 yards and three touchdowns on 20 carries. Caleb Bucinski had 191 yards rushing and a TD on just 10 carries. Drake Crafton rushed for 73 yards and a TD on five attempts. \n“We got all three backs going tonight,” Winamac coach Tim Roth said. “Shorter was great tonight and has been consistent all year. We finally got our two wings in full gear. Bucinski is finally healthy which helps immensely.” \nManchester quarterback Bailey Ness, a transfer from Warsaw, was 14 of 37 passing for 172 yards to lead the Squires. \nBut they were unable to dent the scoreboard as the Warriors led 21-0 at halftime and overcame two lost fumbles in the third quarter. \n“We probably set a school record for batted balls tonight. We had nine different guys knock down a pass,” said Roth, who added Jack DeGroot had a particularly good night covering Manchester leading receiver Keelan Norwood, who entered with 895 receiving yards on the season but was held to five catches for 61 yards. \nDeGroot added 73 yards passing at quarterback on the night with Colin McGee and Luke Pugh combining for six catches for 62 yards. \nWinamac hosts No. 14 Cass next   \nNorthfield 48, Caston 0 \nCaston finishes 1-9 after a lopsided loss at Class A No. 11 Northfield. \nBrayton Jellison had an interception to add to his career total to lead the Comets. \nBut the Norsemen threw the Comets a curveball in regards to the game plan, coach Brady Jones said. \n“We had a good game plan going in and they came out throwing the ball all over the place,” he said. “We wanted to take the run game away and they came out and passed. It’s one of those things where we didn’t respond very well to it. We made adjustments and they didn’t score at all in the second half, but we couldn’t quite recover from our mistakes in the first half. \n“They were fast. They kept us pretty well in check. They played pretty sound football.” \nVolleyball \nN. White 3, Caston 0 \nThe Comets were defeated by the Vikings in three games, 25-17, 25-17, 25-19, Thursday night at the Class A South Newton Sectional. \nA slow start and sectional nerves caused Caston to fall in a 10-2 hole early in game one. Kills by Madison Martin and Tori Rentschler pulled Caston to within 14-10 before the Vikings held on for the win. \nCaston fell behind 11-5 in game three before kills by Rentschler and Kennedy Ault and an ace by Martin and blocks by Ashlynn Kline and Megan Evans tied the score at 14. The score was tied at 16 before North White went on a 5-0 run to key the sweep. \nSeniors Rentschler (8 kills, 7 digs) and Martin (8 assists, 5 digs, 2 kills, 1 ace) led the Comets. \nEvans collected 11 digs and Kaylah Gearhart and Maranda Sanderson added seven apiece. Ault had seven kills and 18 digs, and Kline floored four kills and two aces. Emily Rowe added three digs and a kill. \nCaston finishes 9-25. North White faces South Newton in the later semifinal Saturday following the Pioneer-West Central match.
