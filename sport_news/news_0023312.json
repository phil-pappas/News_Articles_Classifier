The veteran second baseman, eligible to play with the appeal of his two-game suspension for breaking Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada’s leg on a takeout slide scheduled for next week, remains on the bench with Howie Kendrick getting another start.\nHere’s the full Dodgers lineup:\n1. Enrique Hernandez, CF\n2. Kendrick, 2B\n3. Adrian Gonzalez, 1B\n4. Justin Turner, 3B\n5. Corey Seager, SS\n6. Puig, RF\n7. A.J. Ellis, C\n8. Justin Ruggiano, LF\n9. Clayton Kershaw, P\nThe Mets are sticking with the same lineup that produced 13 runs on 13 hits in Monday’s Game 3 victory that gave them a 2-1 series lead. Travis d’Arnaud and Lucas Duda swap places in the order against the lefty Kershaw, going on three days’ rest.\nHere’s the Mets lineup:\n1. Curtis Granderson, RF\n2. David Wright, 3B\n3. David Murphy, 2B\n4. Yoenis Cespedes, LF\n5. d’Arnaud, C\n6. Duda, 1B\n7. Wilmer Flores, SS\n8. Juan Lagares, CF\n9.
