(AP) â€” Freshman Drew Lock will make his second career start Saturday when Missouri hosts No. 11 Florida. \nStarting QB Maty Mauk was suspended indefinitely last Tuesday for violation of team policies, along with backup offensive lineman Malik Cuellar, who was reinstated Monday. Coach Gary Pinkel said the timetable for Mauk's return is unknown. \nLock made his debut start in a 24-10 victory against South Carolina last Saturday, becoming the first freshman to start at quarterback for the Tigers since Corby Jones in 1995. He completed 21 of 28 passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns. The last Missouri quarterback to complete 75 percent of his passes with at least 20 completions was Blaine Gabbert in 2010 against McNeese State. \nClayton Echard will start at tight end for Missouri after Sean Culkin was sprained his right knee in a 21-13 loss to Kentucky Sept. 26. Culkin is expected to miss at least one more week. \nThe Tigers (4-1, 1-1 SEC) will try and hand Florida (5-0, 3-0) its first loss of the season. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
