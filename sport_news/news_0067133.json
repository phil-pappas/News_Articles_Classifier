Tuesday brought the news that both Kris Dunn of Providence College and the University of Rhode Island's E.C. Matthews are on watch lists for major national awards. Dunn is one of 20 point guards who are considered the top contenders to win the Bob Cousy award as the nation's top collegiate point guard. Other leading contenders should be Fred VanVleet of Wichita State, Marcus Paige of North Carolina and Tyler Ulis of Kentucky. Delon Wright of Utah won the award last season. Matthews, now a junior at URI, is among the 20 players being considered for the Jerry West award as the nation's top shooting guard. Oklahoma's Buddy Hield and Virginia's Malcom Brogdon are leading contenders for an award won last season by Ohio State's D`Angelo Russell in its first year of existence. Dunn is seeing a blizzard of preseason buzz entering this season. He will be the Big East's preseason Player of the Year when the conference gathers for its annual media day Wednesday at Madison Square Garden and has already been tabbed a first team preseason All-American by several media outlets. One, CBSSports.com , rated Dunn first overall on a list of the nation's Top 100 players based on \"basic talent and ability at the college level.\" Rhody's Matthews (53rd) and Hassan Martin (90th) were also included on that list.
