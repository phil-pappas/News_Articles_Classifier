The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this.\n- President Obama\nAfter two more campus shootings left two students dead and four wounded in Arizona and Texas on Friday, the president's comments after nine were shot and killed at an Oregon college the week before become even more foreboding.\nWith the House in apparent disarray following the unexpected resignation of its speaker, the possibility of a new gun law has gone from remote to inconceivable. Democratic House members pushed for a procedural vote last week on a bill to expand background checks to all online and gun-show sales. But that doomed effort, which failed in a 240-183 vote, seemed to be more about partisan politics than gun control.\nMore coverage Opinion: Taking glamour from guns saves lives Gun advocates challenge zoos' bans on possession around US Ben Carson's gun comments highlight free-wheeling style Senate Democrats plan to offer a similar bill, but Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), who with Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) sponsored an unsuccessful background check expansion after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings, said he wasn't asked to be a cosponsor. Some Democrats have retorted that if Toomey were truly committed, he would have reintroduced the 2013 bill following the June massacre in a Charleston, S.C., church.\nGiven Congress' inability to grasp the meaning of statesmanship, it's understandable that the president is considering an executive order to impose new background check rules for gun purchases. Republicans who have long insisted that Obama acts like a monarch are warning that any executive order restricting gun rights would be a violation of the Second Amendment. But that would be up to a court to decide.\nMeanwhile, a companion effort to make it harder for people with mental disabilities to get guns may have an easier path in Congress, but it's difficult to gauge its likely results. Experts generally agree that the mentally ill are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Furthermore, many mass murderers, including at least one of the Columbine killers, apparently acted out despite having been prescribed psychotropic drugs.\nThose are some of the observations being made by critics of legislation sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy (R., Pa.), a licensed clinical psychologist, that would overhaul the nation's mental health system. The bill would eliminate the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and give families access to medical information to help monitor relatives with mental illness. But there are fears that the legislation would trample on patients' civil liberties.\nIn any case, the limited likely impact of mental health reform on the unacceptable number of mass shootings in this country means it is no substitute for effective gun control. Americans have a right to own guns, but the Constitution does not specify the number, type, or rules that must be followed for ownership. Reasonable people should be able to agree on measures that would make it more difficult for people who should not have guns to get them without unduly encumbering ownership for lawful purposes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:32:19.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
