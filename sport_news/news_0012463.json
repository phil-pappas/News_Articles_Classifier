Join the Conversation Auburn: Major League Assessment Gabe Gross 8:37 p.m. CDT October 13, 2015 \nI can not remember an Auburn vs Kentucky matchup that will mean as much to Auburn as this one will. If Auburn is able to win, there are still a lot of possibilities out there. If Auburn can make some adjustments, gain a little confidence, and get some momentum in October, you never know what might happen in November. If Auburn loses in Lexington this Thursday, things will look really bleak for the Tigers. Buy Photo \nGabe Gross at Auburn University on Wednesday, July 29, 2015. (Photo: Albert Cesare / Advertiser) \nThere is an argument to be made that Kentucky is the most beatable of Auburn’s remaining SEC opponents and Auburn has had extra time to prepare for the Wildcats. A loss to Kentucky brings up the possibility of every unthinkable scenario I can imagine. Simply put Auburn must win this game. \nThe good news for Auburn on defense is Kentucky is not great at running the ball. They are only averaging 135 yards per game. Auburn’s struggles stopping the run this year are well documented. Currently Auburn is dead last in the conference in rushing defense, giving up 209 yards per game. I believe Auburn will get better on defense the longer the season goes but I don’t believe this particular game will come down to Auburn stopping the run. I believe it is going to come down to getting pressure on Kentucky’s quarterback Patrick Towles when they try to throw the ball down field and making open field tackles when Kentucky implements their screen and quick passing game. \nBecause Kentucky struggles to run the ball, they try to get the ball in the hands of their playmakers by throwing a lot of short passes and quick screens. Auburn’s ability to come up and make sure tackles for little or no gain on those plays, especially on first down, is a big key for Auburn winning the football game. \nOffensively Auburn’s task is a simple one philosophically but that doesn’t make it an easy one to accomplish. The Tigers must find a way to get more balanced by throwing the football more. In no way does this mean they need to throw it all over the field and forget about running the football. Running the football is always going to be the staple of a Gus Malzahn offense and it should be. Auburn though has been so ineffective throwing the football that defenses can focus on the running game almost exclusively. \nI don’t think Auburn needs to throw the ball 35-40 times a game to be effective. To me the number of passes thrown is not as important as when you throw them and how efficient you are with them. Auburn needs to show early in the game they can throw successfully on first and second down because that is when defenses are keyed solely on Peyton Barber and the running game. If you can have success throwing the ball on first and second down early in the game, that will open up lanes to run in late in the game. \nLinebackers and safeties have to stay on their heels on early downs an extra split second to make sure Barber has the ball instead of flying toward the line of scrimmage with no fear of the ball being thrown. That puts the pressure right on the shoulders of either Jeremy Johnson or Sean White. Whoever starts has to prove to Gus Malzahn and himself that he can handle the pressure cooker in which he finds himself. There is no other way to find out if they can handle it, other than to allow them the opportunity to succeed or fail with the ball in there hands. \nIf Thursday night brings us nothing else, it will bring us an interesting observation in sports psychology. How big of a gamble is Gus Malzahn willing to take on his quarterback being able to handle the passing game? Who is he willing to take the gamble with and how will either Jeremy Johnson or Sean White respond to the challenge and pressure of Gus’s decision to gamble on them? \nThursday we will have the answers.
