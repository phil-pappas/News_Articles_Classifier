He ran the fast break Sunday, participated in a full scrimmage and even engaged in some trash talking, all of which means one thing.\nBryant is back.\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Bryant, outside a bit of rustiness, appears ready to go for the Lakers’ regular-season opener against Minnesota on Wednesday at Staples Center.\n“He looked pretty good,” Lakers coach Byron Scott said. “He ran well. Shot the ball pretty well. He was OK. We’ll see how he feels tomorrow and then we will go from there.”\nBryant has missed the past two weeks, including the final three preseason games, because of bruise on his lower left leg, an injury he suffered in the Lakers’ preseason game in Las Vegas. But the Lakers star apparently showed little effects of an 11-day layoff.\n“He was on the fast break,” World Peace said. “I was like, ‘Wow, Kobe’s back.’”\nScott admitted he harbored some concerns about Bryant’s readiness for the season heading into Sunday’s practice.\n“I told him if he couldn’t go today or tomorrow, I would start worrying,” Scott said. “So, he walked out today and said he felt good, gave me the thumbs up and went through the scrimmage and everything.”\nThat included flashes of Bryant’s competitiveness.\nWorld Peace said that during a scrimmage two players, reportedly Nick Young and Lou Williams, on the opposing team “decided to (trash) talk to Kobe. That was the wrong thing to do.”\nBryant’s team, which included World Peace, overcame a deficit to win the scrimmage.\n“I’m not going to disclose any names because we’re a very confidential organization,” World Peace said. “But it wasn’t the right move. It was definitely not smart.”\nBryant left the court to get treatment before reporters were allowed into practice, but World Peace was eager to discuss how impressive the 37-year-old guard looked. He predicted Bryant would “play well” and opponents are going to have their hands full defensively.\n“You have to double him. You’re not going to be able to guard him one-on-one,” World Peace said. “We’ll see who succeeds with that. He’s hungry. He’s excited. He looks great. He’s still playing basketball. He’s still enjoying the game.\n“That’s what’s most important. He comes out here and enjoys and plays basketball. He’s doing the right thing, taking care of his body and enjoying talking trash and playing basketball.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:27:21.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
