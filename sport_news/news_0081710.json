Sindhu could not break the stranglehold of Li, who rode on her repertoire of strokes to notch up a 21-19 21-12 win in the summit clash lasting 47 minutes. In the opening game, Li opened up a slender 3-0 lead but Sindhu soon wrested control at 8-6 and then entered the break with an 11-10 lead. After the breather, Sindhu zoomed to a massive 16-10 lead. However, Li played some delectable drops to narrow the gap to 13-16. But a down-the-line smash from Sindhu helped her gather another point. The Indian lost a couple of points at the net to allow Li claw back to 16-17. Li mixed her shots well and varied the pace to deceive Sindhu and draw parity at 17-17. An outstretched Sindhu failed to connect as Li grabbed the lead. Sindhu then upped the tempo and gave an aggressive charge to pocket the next point. Li then engaged in a flat game and Sindhu’s shot got buried into the net. The Chinese gained a two-point lead to be at 20-18. An accurate down-the-line return helped Sindhu save one game point but she erred in judging the shuttle’s trajectory in the next point to allow Li to walk away with the first game. In the second game, Li surged ahead (6-1) in a jiffy. A poorly executed net shot and the failure to connect a return at the forecourt by Li helped Sindhu earn a couple of points. But Li continued to ride on the errors committed by the Indian. Sindhu's regular returns also started going wide as Li went into the interval 11-4 ahead. The drift in the hall bothered Sindhu but Li rode on some spectacular shots to move to 13-4. Sindhu was made to stretch by Li, who was simply outstanding as she led 19-12 with a crosscourt slice. Li reached the match point after Sindhu hit long once again and the Chinese won her first title of an injury-ridden season with another winner. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:08:18.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
