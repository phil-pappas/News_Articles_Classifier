TCU started with a 41-second drive, and after its second drive chewed up 62 yards and 2:43, the last two TD drives covered just 1:22 and 1:33.\nThe TCU defensive backs got a workout. The Mustangs were determined to stretch the field and threw deep passes on all sorts of occasions, including a fourth-and-5 situation at TCU's 41-yard line. On their next possession, the Mustangs went deep and completed a 63-yard strike to Ryheem Malone.\nAgainst Baylor in the opener, the Mustangs mismanaged the clock and botched an excellent scoring opportunity. On Saturday, they had a first-and-goal at the TCU 1 with 20 seconds to go in the first half and converted a scoring pass from Matt Davis to Courtland Sutton.\nFans may have noticed a herd of Mustang players on the sideline wearing jerseys and red shorts. Most waved towels on kickoffs and other key plays. Those are players who are either true freshmen who are redshirting or injured players who could not suit up against TCU.\nEight first-year offensive players saw significant action for SMU. Freshman RB Xavier Jones, who made his second straight start, and freshman WR Kevin Thomas wasted no time making an impact. On the opening drive, Thomas caught a 16-yard pass to convert a third-and-9, setting up Jones' 2-yard touchdown run.\nSenior WR Darius Joseph, ninth in career receptions on SMU's all-time list, has been used sparingly, giving way to younger players. He has two starts this season but only one catch â” for 13 yards in the opener against Baylor.\nTCU has won 14 of the last 16 games against SMU. The Frogs lead the series, which began in 1915, 48-40-7.\nEddie Sefko, Bill Nichols\nMORE COVERAGE\nClick here to visit the SMU page.\nNichols: SMU throws scare into No. 3 TCU, but Frogs QB Boykin's six TDs too much for Mustangs\nExperience playing Baylor, TCU for SMU freshmen will 'will pay big, big dividends' as season progresses\nSMU-TCU quick hits: Frogs strike quickly in first half; Mustangs test TCU secondary\nPhotos: Trevone Boykin leads TCU as Frogs claim Iron Skillet with 56-37 win over SMU\nFive Thoughts: SMU shows no quit under Chad Morris, nearly shocks rival TCU\nClick here to visit the TCU page.\nFive thoughts from No. 3 TCU's 56-37 win over SMU: Horned Frogs escape upset bid to capture Iron Skillet\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-3-tcus-56-37-win-smu-horned-frogs-escape-upset-bid-capture-iron-skillet", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/smu-tcu-quick-hits-frogs-strike-quickly-first-half-mustangs-test-tcu-secondary", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/smu-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcu-horned-frogs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-smu-shows-quit-chad-morris-nearly-shocks-rival-tcu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/nichols-smu-throws-scare-3-tcu-frogs-qb-boykins-six-tds-much-mustangs", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/09/19/photos-trevone-boykin-leads-tcu-battle-iron-skillet-smu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/solid-outings-baylor-tcu-means-experience-smu-freshmen-will-will-pay-big-big-dividends-season-progresses"], "published": "2015-09-20T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:53:00.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
