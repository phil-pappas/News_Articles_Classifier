By Chuck Mobley A recognized national treasure and attraction, the Isaiah Davenport House Museum takes on an added dimension this month as it serves as a multi-story stage for “Stranger Than Fiction: An Exploration of the Extraordinary in Old Savannah.”\nA 90-minute production, “Stranger Than Fiction” illustrates several early 19th-century attractions, such as Phantasmagoria, in which lanterns and mirrors would reflect and project ghostly images, and Monster Soup, in which a magnified drop of river water was projected by a solar microscope onto a screen, producing a frightful microcosm filled with seemingly bizarre, outsized “snakes.”\n“It was thrilling to be so horrified,” said Raleigh Marcell, who helped write and produce the show.\nThat thrill was the appeal of such shows, which traveled from town to town, heralding their arrival with newspaper ads. In Savannah, they would often set up at the Long Room of the City Exchange, located where City Hall stands today.\nThe script for “Stranger Than Fiction” was largely put together by Marcell, who also helped plan and produce “Dreadful Pestilence: Savannah’s Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1820,” the long-running dramatization that was named the Georgia Museum Program of the Year in 2004.\nThe first act of “Stranger Than Fiction” is staged in the adjacent Kennedy Pharmacy, on the north side of the lane behind the Davenport House. A slideshow, complete with music by Schubert, Beethoven and Mendelssohn, the three leading composers of that age, will amplify and explain such phenomenons as Phantasmagoria and Monster Soup.\nAfter that, the audience will move into another star of the show, the Davenport House itself. It was constructed in the Federal style in 1820 by master builder Isaiah Davenport, who died of yellow fever in 1827, the year before the setting of “Stranger Than Fiction.” An effort to save the house from the wrecking ball led to the formation of the Historic Savannah Foundation in 1955. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and received the “Preserve America Presidential Award for Private Restoration” in a ceremony at the White House in 2005.\nScenes will be played out in several of the house’s rooms and floors, so be prepared to walk up its many flights of stairs.\nIn the rarely seen attic of the house, Jamal Touré, who also helped write and produce the show, portrays Bri Bari Touré Sow, a free man of color living in Yamacraw. His presentation focuses on conjuring, spells and beliefs of African-American Savannahians of the 1820s. He offers several potions to those seeking health, love or even the death and destruction of others.\nTouré is an expert on Gullah culture and African-American history who teaches Africana Studies at Savannah State University.\n“Stranger Than Fiction” is a rare opportunity to tour the house by candlelight, when shadows loom and the 19th century seems closer, said Jamie Credle, director of the museum, who portrays the Widow Davenport in the production.\n“Featured in the garret room painted in the ‘haint blue’ color, Jamal’s authentic characterization makes the DH’s October living history program memorable,” she said.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: “Stranger Than Fiction: An Exploration of the Extraordinary in Old Savannah”\nWhen: Davenport House Museum, 324 E.
