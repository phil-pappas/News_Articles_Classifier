Anderson recently tore down two exterior walls, which they say left the building in imminent danger of collapse.\nAnderson had been issued a stop-work order in February.\nThe building had been built in the 1820s and once housed a one-story, double-door carriage house where horses were kept.\nThe Advocate couldn't reach Anderson for comment.\nInformation from: The New Orleans Advocate, http://www.neworleansadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
