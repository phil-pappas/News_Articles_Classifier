(Image Source: Harry How/Getty Images) \nThe New York Mets became the only team to close the Division Series on the road when they beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 in Game 5. The champagne and beer were flowing in the celebratory postgame locker room and while they surely partied like it was 1986, the Mets need to get back to business quickly as they host Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs on Saturday night. Here’s a look at their lineup and bench heading into the next round: \nThe Lineup: The Mets won Game 5 and are in the NLCS because of the heroics of 2B Daniel Murphy . He drove in the game’s first run with an RBI double in the first inning giving the Mets a 1-0 lead. Murphy then stole a run (almost literally) when he took advantage of LA’s lackadaisical defense as he went from first to third on walk (turning point!), before scoring on a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning to tie the game at 2-2. In the top of the sixth Murphy took a 3-2 pitch from likely Cy Young Award winner Zack Greinke over the right-field wall for the game winner. Murphy (.333) hit three home runs in the series—all off Greinke and Clayton Kershaw —with five RBIs and five runs scored. \nIf Murphy wasn’t New York’s hottest bat in the NLDS, it was RF Curtis Granderson , who hit .389 and got on base at a .476 clip. He drove home five runs in Game 3 to tie a Mets postseason record. As he’s done all season, Grandy served as a table setter and a run producer. He provides patience and power at the top of the order. \nIn beating the Dodgers, the Mets had to overcome an abysmal series from 3B David Wright and 1B Lucas Duda . Wright had a clutch 2-RBI single in Game 1 but was shutdown in the final four games of the series, going 1 for 16 (.063) against Dodger pitching. Duda (.111), who is supposed to provide middle-of-the-order power (27 HRs in 471 regular season ABs), set a division series record with 11 Ks in 18 ABs. They were able to advance without much from either of their corner infielders, but to make it to the World Series, New York will need one if not both to come alive. \nOf course it might not matter if slugging OF Yoenis Cespedes gets hot, because more than any other Met he can carry the team. Cespedes went yard twice against LA, including a laser-moon shot in Game 3, however he did not look comfortable at the plate (.250) for most of the series, too often swinging at high heat and fishing for breaking pitches, resulting in eight strikeouts. Catcher Travis d’Arnaud was also struck out eight times, while batting just .158. He will look to do damage early in counts because he lacks confidence once he falls behind. \nRounding out New York’s regulars is a troika of homegrown youngsters. By now everyone has seen the dirty slide that ended Ruben Tejada’s postseason, which has forced manager Terry Collins’s hand. Flushing folk hero Wilmer Flores is the fulltime shortstop now. Flores has power (16 HRs) and he looked good at the plate (.300) in the NLDS. The concern with him isn’t on offense but in the field, where he lacks range and can be prone to errors. CF Juan Lagares is a Gold Glover winner who is known for his defense. He will likely start Game 1 against lefty Jon Lester pushing Cespedes to left field. Lagares was 3-for-7 (.429) with a pair of doubles against LA. Against right-handed pitching expect to see rookie Michael Conforto start in LF with Cespedes in center. Conforto was just 1-for-7 but he took good cuts and went deep in Game 2 against Greinke. The 22-year old has power to all fields and looks like a future middle-of-the-order hitter. \nThe Bench: Injuries to Ruben Tejada and postseason-tested Juan Uribe has really hurt New York’s bench. It hasn’t just robbed them of their depth, but their flexibility. Their primary pinch hitter will be lefty Kelly Johnson , who also has a dash of playoff experience and provides pop. From the right side, Collins will look to Michael Cuddyer , who started Game 1 of the NLDS. After going 0-for-3 with two misplays in left field in the series opener, Cuddy only got one more AB the rest of the series. He won’t start against Chicago but don’t be surprised if he gets a chance to make an impact off the bench in a pinch-hitting role. Expected to round out the bench will be OF Kirk Nieuwenhuis , as well as rookies, C Kevin Plawecki and SS Matt Reynolds . None of them saw action against LA and Reynolds (called up after Tejada went down) has yet to make his MLB debut. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
