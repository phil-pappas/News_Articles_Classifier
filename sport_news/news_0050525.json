It's especially true in the playoffs, where these games are really tight, and you see that happen,\" Davis coach Souli Phongsavath said. \"Our defense has been strong this whole time; they've kept us in games when our offense hasn't been in a rhythm or we haven't been as clinical in our finishing as we should be. We know we wouldn't be anywhere close to where we are now without our defense.\" \nDavis will try to defend its 5A state title against upstart Weber, the second seed from Region 1 that knocked off last year's state runner-up Lone Peak via penalty shootout, at 7 p.m. at Rio Tinto Stadium. \nWatch the game via the video embedded above, or at live.ksl.com . \nIn Class 4A, Skyline and Timpanogos meet for the third-straight time in the championship match. The Eagles (17-1-1) are looking for their first win over the two-time defending state champion Timberwolves (9-5-3) in that span.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:57:43.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
