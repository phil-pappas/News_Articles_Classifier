The series of events began when a Tuolumne County Sheriff’s deputy attempted to stop a man riding a motorcycle at 1:08 a.m. for unusual or suspicious driving, said Robert Lyons, public information officer for the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office. The rider left his motorcycle on Cavalieri Road and disappeared into some bushes. He then attempted to force his way into a Sonora residence. The homeowner fired a 9mm pistol and shot the intruder in the wrist. The Sheriff’s Office statement said, while the homeowner was protecting himself, he was a felon and therefore should not have had a firearm. Deputies arrested James St. Clair, 34, who was booked into Tuolumne County Jail on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Brian Reynolds, 42, of Placerville, was charged with possession of stolen property, evading police officers and possession of a suspended license, Lyons said. Reynolds was flown to Memorial Medical Center and treated for his injury before being booked into Tuolumne County Jail. Neither man was listed as an inmate in the Tuolumne County Jail Tuesday afternoon.
