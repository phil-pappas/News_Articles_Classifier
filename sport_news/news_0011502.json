We have two freshmen and three sophomores starting, so we just had to grow into it, and that is what the difference is right now.” \nA trio of seniors, Sydney Winters, Dominique Ingram and Peyton Smith have led the Lady Indians back to the playoffs. Sydney Winters leads the team with 290 kills and 199 digs, while Dominique Ingram has 274 kills and 80 blocks. Smith has 118 digs and 616 assists. Riley Padgett has 35 aces. \nWith a win, East Coweta would advance to the Class Sweet 16 against North Gwinnett or Chattahoochee. \nNorthgate’s confidence should be at a season-high after the Lady Vikings (26-18) won beat state-ranked opponents three times on the final of the 4- tournament including host McIntosh to capture an area title. \nThe Lady Vikings, like East Coweta, takes on a No. 4 seed with a losing record in Druid Hills (4-10). \nNorthgate is led by Taylor Richard with 298 kills and 184 digs. Katie Stanton has 230 digs. Delaney Surapine has leads the Lady Vikings with 318 assists. \nWith a victory, Northgate would advance to the Class Sweet 16 against either Chapel Hill or Winder-Barrow.
