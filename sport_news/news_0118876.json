The Monarchs improved to 3-4, snapping a five-game winning streak by the Warriors. Matoaca is now 5-2. Following a scoreless first quarter, Matoaca's Cade Driskill powered in the ball for the first score of the night. A PAT kick gave the Warriors a 7-0 lead, but the Monarchs tied it back up as Jordan Hunter took it to the endzone with 9:51 left in the half. The second quarter ended with no more scores after that, the two teams tied at 7-7. Neither team budged in the third quarter with both defenses stepping up throughout the period. Meadowbrook finally broke the standoff. Matt Hodges' touchdown helped lift Meadowbrook to 14-7 as nine minutes remained in regulation. It was tied up again after a touchdown pass from Jamison Harrison to B.J. Flowers, but Meadowbrook returned to the lead off of a Jace Miller touchdown. The Monarchs would hold on against the Warriors for the victory. With a big win under their belts against a fellow 5A school, Meadowbrook (3-4) has a challenging matchup ahead of them when they head to Thomas Dale High School to face the 6-1 Knights next Friday. That same evening, Matoaca will hit the road to face the red-hot Blue Devils (5-2) at Merner Field in Hopewell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:37:46.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
