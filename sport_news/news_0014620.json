These unassuming men do not have fancy degrees but they, indeed, are live examples of how skill training can enhance employability in today’s job-starved country where more than 50 per cent of degree-holders lack employability skills. These enterprising young men from small towns and semi-rural areas have not only made themselves employable, but are also making a difference to their communities by spreading awareness about the importance of eye-care and timely corrective measures. These ‘Eye Mitras’ are a part of the 2.5 New Vision Generation India (NVG) initiative being run by the Essilor group. The main objective of this initiativeis to provide access to vision-care devices to 50 million people by 2020. Statistics reveal that around 2.5 billion people across the world need vision correction. There is a severe dearth of trained opticians in India, especially in smaller centres because of which vision-related problems get aggravated in many cases. “In India, around 550 million people suffer from uncorrected poor vision that affects their quality of life. The total productivity loss due to uncorrected vision is estimated to be $37 billion per annum. Thus, there is an urgent need to bring together all stakeholders — healthcare delivery centres, civil society groups, government agencies and private players — to build a cohesive public education campaign besides linking skill development with vision care for improving the access to quality care through trained human resources”, says Jayanth Bhuvaraghan, Chief Corporate Mission Officer, Essilor International, while highlighting the need to focus on this facet and reach out to maximum number of people in smaller centres in India. The objective of the initiative is to provide assistance to those with uncorrected refractive error (URE) with innovative, scalable and profitable, inclusive business models. It is this business model that has changed the lives of several youngsters like 20-year-old Karan from Mathura. This Plus II pass youth got a new career platform after undergoing an eight-month training module. “I did not have any objective or direction in my life earlier. The course gave me a drive to do something on my own and now I am also earning and supporting my family,” says Karan. He has dispensed spectacles to almost 500 persons in six months of starting his own outlet and is earning Rs 10,000 per month. “No other profession would have given me such an earning in such a short period,” says Praveen, who is running a shop in Saharanpur, and is making around Rs 35,000 per month. “I learnt edging and fitting of lenses in the training and we were also taught how to initiate a business which gave me the courage to start a shop and invest money,” says this graduate who was doing farming before joining the Eye Mitra training at Hapur, UP. The training includes two months of full-time classroom training followed by six months of on-the-job training when the newly trained Eye Mitras work under the guidance and supervision of trained optometrists. The 2.5 NVG helps the trainees by equipping the outlets wherein spectacles and other services are provided at almost half of the market cost. Holding camps to spread awareness about eye care is also a part of their “job” portfolio. “My role is to reach out to people with URE and provide spectacles at an affordable cost. By conducting VSEs (vision screening events) I am reaching out to people and telling them different ways of caring for their eyes,” says Binday Singh, who has a master’s degree and a B.Ed and was teaching in a school before becoming an Eye Mitra. He is making Rs 15,000 per month and is planning to add sophisticated equipment from the profits accrued so far to provide better service to his community. For Yamunanagar-based Tejpal Saini, too, life has taken a U-turn after getting into this field. “My brother is already in the optical business and I knew about it but I did not have the required skill to do something on my own. After completing the course, now I feel that I can aim for a big optical business of my own in future”, says this former account assistant who is earning Rs 25,000 per month at present. While the first Eye Mitra Training programme had trained just 20 people, the mission is gathering steam now as there are 17 operational training centres with plans to open another five on the anvil. These training centres are located in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. At present 784 EMOs are operational in eight states. “Over four lakh people have been given spectacles by trained EMOs and we have now partnered with several local skills and livelihood development agencies to roll out the training of EMO. The plan is to have 10,000 working Eye Mitra opticians by 2020”, says Saugata Banjeree, head of 2.5 NVG India. With the target of training 2,200 more youngsters by 2016, the vision to spread self-reliance is going to be more and more visible in the hinterlands of India soon enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:14:55.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
