Cleburne County, Ranburne football for Oct. 22 Rip Donovan Annistonstar.com Back to back region champs \nKade Clark’s 22-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter and Macain Carlile’s extra point kick snapped a tie and proved to be winning points as the Cleburne County Tigers defeated Saks 36-29 for the Class 4A, Region 6 championship on the road last Friday. \nThe win wasn’t assured until safety Trevor Houston tackled Saks quarterback Quin Smith with less than 10 seconds to go on a fourth-and-six play from the Cleburne County 9-yard line. Cleburne County head coach Michael Shortt said his team’s pass rush pushed Smith out of the pocket and linebacker Austin Harler picked up Houston’s man in pass coverage, freeing the speedy Houston to make the final stop. \nThe win made the Tigers region champions for the second straight season. For the second straight season a win over Saks decided the championship. \n“They were very excited to win the region, especially to win it back-to-back,” Shortt said. “This group, I guess, was more excited than some because a lot of people had counted them out, didn’t expect them to have a great year, didn’t expect them to be as good as they’ve turned out to be so that was exciting for them.” \nNow the Tigers must put last week’s signature victory behind them and prepare for the future. \n“We’ve won the region but we can’t have a letdown. That’s tough to do,” Shortt said. “We’ve just won the region and it’s homecoming so everything’s going against us but we’re going to find out what kind of leaders we have this coming Friday as far as preparing for the game.” \nHokes Bluff (2-6, 2-4) comes to Heflin Friday as each team completes region play. The Tigers (7-1, 6-0) are playing for a perfect region record and have a seven-game winning streak to protect. Shortt said the Eagles have been able to play with quality opponents like Saks and Jacksonville until very late in ball games. \n“They’re typical Hokes Bluff. They’re well coached. They get after it. They’re very physical. They’re very good in places where we’re not as good and that’s a concern to me,” Shortt said. “We’ve got to really go in there and stop them at the line of scrimmage on the inside running game and kind of force them to the outside. That’s our goal” \nAgainst Saks, the Tigers scored first, taking the opening kickoff and moving inside the Saks 10-yard line before Carlile booted a 26-yard field goal. The Wildcats then got touchdowns on their first three possessions. They led 14-3 when the first quarter closed and added another score in the second quarter to extend their lead to 21-3 before the Tigers found their bearings. \n“We got used to the speed that they were running, which you can’t simulate in practice, and we got a couple of stops,” Shortt said. \nThe Tigers made good use of those stops. \nCleburne County’s first touchdown came a on a 29-yard run by Clark at the end of a 69-yard drive. J’son Henson had an 11-yard run and Nick Dunston a 14-yard pass reception from quarterback Brock Swafford along the way. Carlile’s kick cut Saks’ lead to 21-10. \nLater in the second quarter, Swafford connected with Jeremiah Blake on a 32-yard touchdown toss to reduce the deficit to 21-16 at halftime. Dunston had an 11-yard catch, Trevor Houston a 14-yard catch and Henson a 10-yard run as Cleburne County marched 77 yards in eight plays. \nShortt said there was no sense of panic at halftime. Having shown they could run the ball, he felt his team would be able to keep the Saks offense off the field enough to win. \n“Win or lose, the sun is going to come up but you always want to be remembered as giving everything you had. That’s what people are going to remember you by,” Shortt told his players at halftime. \nThe Tigers forced the Saks offense into a three-and-out on the first possession of the second half. Cleburne County drove inside the Saks 25 before losing the ball on downs. On the next play, Noah Ware intercepted a pass by the Wildcats to give Cleburne County possession at the Saks 29. \nShortt called Ware’s interception “the tide turner.” \nThis time, the Tigers wouldn’t be denied. Swafford’s 6-yard pass to Ware put Cleburne County ahead 22-21. A two-point conversion play failed but the Tigers still led 22-21 when the third quarter ended. \nBlake ended the ensuing Saks threat with an interception that he returned 97 yards for a touchdown. When Carlile’s kick was good the scoreboard favored Cleburne County 29-21. Saks ran for a touchdown then got a two-point conversion to make the score 29-29, setting the stage for Clark’s final touchdown. \nOfficial Cleburne County stats showed the Tigers with 374 yards of total offense to 376 yards for Saks. Cleburne County ran for 282 yards and passed for 92. The Wildcats had 266 yards on the ground and 110 through the air, half of that coming on their first touchdown. \nHenson ended with 22 carries for 170 yards Clark ran 14 times for 81 yards and Houston had six carries for 22 yards. \nSwafford was 8-for-14 passing for 92 yards with no interceptions. Blake, covered by two and even three defenders all night, ended with one catch for the 32-yard touchdown. Dunston had two receptions for 25 yards. Houston caught two passes for 18 yards. Jake Lee had a 9-yard catch. Ware’s 6-yard touchdown grab was his lone reception. Offensive lineman Dawson Howle nabbed a deflected pass for a 2-yard gain. \nMario Smith was Cleburne County’s leading tackler with 12. Harler ended with 10 stops. Chad Brown, Wade Dasinger and Houston each made seven tackles. Colt Funderburk had six tackles. Christian Hartley and Matt Norton each recorded five tackles and Taylor Rice had four tackles. Blake and Ware each made three tackles in addition to their interceptions. Bulldogs are ready for big rivalry \nWith an open date on its schedule last week, Ranburne should enter Friday’s game against arch-rival Woodland well-rested. The Bulldogs have won the last four games in the series that dates back to 1931. Ranburne defeated Woodland twice last year, at Woodland during the regular season and at home in the Class 2A playoffs. \nFriday’s game in Ranburne will be the only meeting this year. Ranburne, now 6-1 overall and 4-1 in region games, has assured itself the No. 2 position in Class 2A, Region 5. Woodland (2-6, 1-4), which had appeared in the playoffs for 11 consecutive seasons, cannot make the postseason this time even if the Bobcats beat the Bulldogs Friday. \nWoodland opened with a 43-0 win over Beulah then lost a close game to Midfield by a 20-7 margin. The Bobcats were edged by Randolph County 21-20 in their third game. Woodland’s next four games were sizeable losses – by 18 points, 14 points, 23 points and 25 points. Last week, the Bobcats slipped past winless Horseshoe Bend 49-42. \n“Later on in the year, injuries started taking their toll but I’m sure we’re going to see their best game,” Ranburne coach Chad Young said. \nA win over playoff-bound Ranburne would go a long way toward salvaging Woodland’s season. \n“This is their playoffs and our position can’t change either way. They’ve really got everything in their favor,” Young said. \nAfter Ranburne, Woodland finishes its season against Wadley. \n“The only one that probably matters is this one to them,” Young said. \nWoodland’s offense has been heavily run-oriented, passing no more than 20 percent of the time if that often. The Bobcats “run the ball real well” in Young’s view. However, he doesn’t feel the Bobcats will limit themselves to business as usual. \n“We’ll see some different stuff, no doubt,” Young predicted. \nThe Bulldogs seem to have returned to work with a bit more bounce in their collective step. \n“We’ve practiced well this week,” Young said prior to Wednesday’s workout. “We’ve had two good ones.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:11:47.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
