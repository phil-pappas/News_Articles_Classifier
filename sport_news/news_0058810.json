(Photo: Photo illustration: Greg Hester, USA TODAY Sports) 100 CONNECT 35 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIn honor of Super Bowl 50, here are 50 things we learned in Week 4: \n1. Atlanta Falcons running back Devonta Freeman became the first RB since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 to score three TD in consecutive games. Tomlinson actually extended the stretch to three straight games that year. \n2. Washington QB Kirk Cousins led the Redskins on a game-winning TD drive against the Dolphins. Let that sink in for a while. \n3. Matt Hasselbeck became the first 40-year-old QB to start since Brett Favre in 2010, according to Pro Football Reference. \n4. And, of course, Ed Hochuli was the official working the Indianapolis Colts game. We’re guessing Hasselbeck is old enough to get calls. We’re kidding. We think. \n5. The Miami Dolphins were 0-16 on third- and fourth-down conversions against the New York Jets. Maybe it was the jet lag to London. \n6. Given the way kickers performed Sunday, Chicago’s Robbie Gould should be asking for a raise after nailing a game-winning 48-yard field goal. \n7. Of course, given the mood in Chicago, it probably just means he is now trade bait. \n8. The Buffalo Bills committed 17 penalties. Wow. \n9. Aaron Rodgers is just fun to watch when he has the football in his hands. That is all. \n10. Words we never thought we would write: Two teams in the NFC South (Atlanta and Carolina) are 4-0. The Harrisons: Tramon Williams earns spot in Browns infamy ... but no trophy \n11. With at least 16 missed PAT attempts (and counting) from the longer distance, the NFL has accomplished its aim to add drama to the once-mundane extra-point conversion. \n12. And by the way, If you are an unemployed kicker, please start looking at real estate listings in Tampa, Philadelphia and possibly Jacksonville. Our advice, though: Rent, don’t buy. \n13. The Houston Texans didn’t take long to get Arian Foster involved. First three plays from scrimmage: two runs for Foster, one pass catch. But a fumble returned for TD spoiled his season debut. Remember when we thought everything would be OK with the Texans when Foster returned. \n14. Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh certainly didn’t look like he was trying too hard to tackle Jets running back Chris Ivory. Just sayin’. \n15. Jameis Winston should just try to skip his first pass of the day. For the second time in four weeks, it resulted in a pick-six. And the rest of his day wasn’t much better. \n16. Colts OL Todd Herremans was a healthy inactive. Maybe Chip Kelly got one right in the offseason. But it looks like he got everything else wrong. \n17. The Dolphins run defense is so bad that Jets QB Ryan Fitzpatrick had 34 yards rushing. \n18. At one point in the first quarter, Washington had 99 yards and six points while Philly had minus-8 yards. \n19. If you haven’t seen Giants LB Devon Kennard’s interception, check it out. Respect from linebackers - and a few cornerbacks - everywhere. \n20 . And then watch Amari Cooper get both feet inbounds on a 26-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. Wow. Pelissero: Stephen Ross needs to take all-or-nothing approach to Dolphins brass \n21. Didn’t you use to be Joe Philbin? \n22. Jay Cutler 's TD pass was the first score of the day — in the United States, that is. \n23. That was the 17th time Adrian Peterson has rushed for a touchdown of 40 or more yards. \n24. Jeremy Hill had a strong TD run to start the day for the Cincinnati Bengals. And then he added two more. That has to be encouraging to Bengals fans. \n25 . Thursday flashback: Doesn’t it seem like Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Todd Haley is trying to prove he is smarter than the other coach rather than calling the best play for his team sometimes? Bell: Under Chip Kelly, Eagles look inept in every way \n26. Miami’s best plays in the first half: Pass-interference calls. Two - 36 and 22 yards against the Jets - lead to the Dolphins’ first touchdown. \n27. Detroit Lions fans should be happy the Redskins-Eagles game wasn’t moved there. Those folks have seen enough bad football. \n28 . Bengals QB Andy Dalton looked confident early against the Kansas City Chiefs, completing his first 10 passes for 179 yards. \n29. The Eagles have been outscored 46-27 in first halves this season. Thanks to Martin Frank of The News Journal in Wilmington, Del. for that one. \n30. The St. Louis Rams: If you figure them out, give us a call. Sunday's fantasy highlights: Jeremy Hill gets reacquainted with the end zone \n31. Looking ahead: In his only visit to Dallas, Tom Brady threw five TD passes in a 48-27 rout of the Cowboys at Texas Stadium on Oct. 14, 2007. He and the Patriots return in Week 5 in their first trip to JerryWorld. \n32. Drew Brees picked an excellent time for career TD pass No. 400: His connection with running back C.J. Spiller in overtime lifted the New Orleans Saints to a 26-20 win over the Cowboys. \n33. When it comes to Tyrod Taylor, the Buffalo Bills might have to take the bad with the good. After dissecting the Dolphins last week, Taylor looked lost when forced to make plays in the pocket against the Giants. \n34. Rex Ryan’s defense barely laid a hand on Eli Manning, who figured out the Bills' blitzes. \n35. The Falcons have undoubtedly taken on the personality of high-energy coach Dan Quinn. Broncos' confident defense cements standing in win against Vikings \n36. And what ever happened to the Texans defense? Guess this takes J.J. Watt out of the MVP debate. \n37. The Panthers have lost so many major players (Kelvin Benjamin, Luke Kuechly, Charles Johnson), but as long as they have Cam Newton and Ron Rivera, they still have a chance to win on any Sunday. \n38. Two young cornerbacks playing like all-pros: Carolina’s Josh Norman and Atlanta’s Desmond Trufant. \n39. It was out of bounds, but that catch by Odell Beckham reminds us he might have the best glove, er, hands in the league. \n40. Curious coaching decision I: Redskins coach Jay Gruden punted from the Eagles 35. Touchback. So it netted 15 yards. \n41. Curious coaching decision II: Texans coach Bill O’Brien changes QB when it is 42-0 - a little late, no? - and then uses Watt on offense. If he had gotten injured on offense, in a rout … \n42. Ronnie Hillman's 72-yard run was the fourth longest TD run in broncos history. \n43. Indianapolis’ Adam Vinatieri became the first player in league history to top 1,000 points with two teams. \n44. It just doesn’t seem like a Sunday, though, since the Falcons didn’t need a fourth-quarter comeback and the Giants didn’t blow a fourth-quarter lead. \n45. But we knew it was Sunday when we heard Peyton Manning yelling “Omaha” on our TV. Bills unravel behind undisciplined play against Giants \n46. Least surprising nugget of the day: DeMarco Murray not happy with this role in the Eagles offense. \n47. Green Bay had a fourth-and-1 and gave the ball to their best running back. And everybody in Pittsburgh, flashing back to Thursday, just groaned. \n48. File this away: The Falcons also started 4-0 in 2004 and 2012. They made it to the NFC Championship game both years. \n49. Eli Manning threw his first interception of the season after 142 passes without one. \n50. And now you know why we were so excited to see Rams running back Todd Gurley get healthy: 19 carries for 146 yards, and he could have had more. \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 4 Posted!
