Offensive coordinator Clay Helton was appointed interim coach Sunday. \nUSC hasn’t elaborated on Sarkisian’s problems, but the second-year coach had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated while giving a speech. Sarkisian later apologized and said he had combined alcohol and medication, and he promised not to drink again during the season. \nSarkisian’s unsteady appearance Sunday prompted Haden to make the program’s fourth coaching change in just over two years. \n“After careful consideration of what is in the best interest of the university and our student-athletes, I have made the decision to terminate Steve Sarkisian, effective immediately,” Haden said in a statement. “I want to add how proud I am of our coaching staff and players and the way they are responding to this difficult situation. Through all of this we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well-being.” \nThe Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12) will visit No. 14 Notre Dame on Saturday. \nSarkisian went 12-6 at USC, where he started as an assistant coach under Pete Carroll, now the coach of the Seattle Seahawks. \n“This is an opportunity for Sark to get right and to get well,” Carroll said Monday. “We’re pulling for him. He’s up against some big challenges, and he’s got to go ahead and take care of it. It’s not about coaching now. It’s about his personal life and getting things in order. I know he’s committed to taking the right steps to do that, and it’s hugely important for him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:34:08.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
