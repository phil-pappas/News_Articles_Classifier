He didn’t choke up. \nHe even grinned and joked. \nMichigan’s punter who fumbled away the Wolverines’ 27-23 loss to Michigan State on the final play Saturday knew the reason he was surrounded by cameras Tuesday night at the Towsley Museum at Schembechler Hall. \nBut did it bother him? Not a bit. \nFor three days, while the Michigan fan base worried about his psyche, national pundits ranked where the play ranked in sports lows and ESPN’s Sports Science broke down to the hundredths of seconds how he bobbled, stepped and spun in those critical final 10 seconds Saturday night. \nO’Neill woke up Sunday and moved on. \nWith his family in town from Australia, there was a support system had he needed it for healing. \nNot that he needed it. \n“I don’t know if there was a healing process, you make errors in a football game, you learn from them and you sort of move on,” he said, in his Australian accent. “Great to have them here to look over and go, ‘Hey, could you have done better there?’ My brother and dad played football growing up so they know the situation.” \nO’Neill may not have needed a boost, but he knows it was out there. \nThough he avoided Twitter the past few days — “I figured I’d be better to let this one cool off a little bit,” he said — the messages of support reached him . \n“Been very interesting, a lot of support from the Michigan fan base, from teammates, even the people back home that a game over here could get all the way back to Australia, but it did,” he said. “It’s been overwhelming the support I’ve received.” \nAmong the most valuable calls came from former Michigan kicker Jay Feely, who related on a number of levels, understanding the rivalry and special teams intensity. \nThough O’Neill’s teammates didn’t bombard him — some just gave him a quick word in the locker room — they bought heavily into coach Jim Harbaugh’s message: “Not one football game has come down to one play,” senior Graham Glasgow repeated, pointing out if the offense got a first down, the game would have been over. “A loss is never on one player.” \nFor Glasgow, it hurt him to see O’Neill suffering, especially knowing all O’Neill did to keep U-M in the game with three punts inside the 10, including an 80-yarder, the second longest in U-M history. Talkin' Wolverines podcast: What else went wrong? \nO’Neill has watched the play itself a few times, simply for instruction and corrections as he would after any game. It’s not that he’s casual or doesn’t care about the rivalry but, at 22, he’s mature enough to face it and leave it behind. \nThat was his obvious message Tuesday about the end — where he bobbled the ball, recovered and spun only to bat the ball into the hands of MSU’s Jalen Watts-Jackson, who returned it for the 38-yard score. No excuses. \nThe low snap? Wasn’t a problem. He even joked that he and long snapper Scott Sypniewski will now be tied together “for the rest of our lives.” \nConcerned that Sypniewski was hit early? “Football’s a physical game,” O’Neill said. \nThe heat from MSU rush? “It was pretty cold that game,” he said, joking. “It’s not really panic. … I knew I had pressure, I thought I had time but turned out not to be the case. As fate would have it, that was the result.” \nWatching Watts-Jackson return it? “I wish I could have run him down, but I don’t think I’m that quick.” \nEven the idea of audibling when he saw no returner, he joked about when he was stuffed on fourth down earlier this year. “I learned my lesson against BYU.” \nIn this case, instinct flashed back to his days growing up in Australian Rules Football, where “we’re sort of taught to pick it up and move it on. Obviously, that’s completely on me.” \nYet O’Neill’s comfort dealing with it is no surprise to his coaches, those at Michigan or back in Australia. \n\"His nerves weren't rattled before the situation and they weren't rattled after,\" his trainer from Pro Kick Australia, Nathan Chapman, told the Free Press by phone . \"It was just a play. He would have liked to have caught the ball (cleanly), but he's over it really quickly, in terms of a need to know. It's always been his process, it's always about the next kick.\" \nU-M coach Jim Harbaugh, who checked in on O’Neill over the weekend to gauge his emotions, expected O’Neill to handle the negative spotlight as well as anyone ever has. \n\"You don't know Blake like we do,” Harbaugh said of the graduate transfer, who played last year at Weber State. “He's been outstanding for us all season long and was tremendous in this last football game. There's a saying, 'Adversity can't build character, but it certainly reveals it.' And you're going to certainly see in Blake O'Neill, his character, his fortitude is at that highest level.\" \nThe media crush of cameras and microphones didn’t bother him at all. When asked why he would come out to address his gaffe, his answer was succinct: “Why not?” \n“Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and go again, that’s the beauty of sport,” he said. “You get a chance to prove yourself against Minnesota (on Oct. 31). That we’re improving and we’ve learned from the stuff we did against Michigan State.” \nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
