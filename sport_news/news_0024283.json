METS (90-72) vs. CHICAGO CUBS (97-65)\nGame 1 @ New York, Saturday, 8 p.m.: LHP Jon Lester (11-12, 3.34) vs. RHP Matt Harvey (13-8, 2.71)\nGame 2 @ New York, Sunday, 8 p.m.: RHP Jake Arrieta (22-6, 1.77) vs. RHP Noah Syndergaard (9-7, 3.24)\nGame 3 @ Chicago, Tuesday, 8 p.m.: RHP Jacob deGrom (14-8, 2.54) vs. TBA\nGame 4 @ Chicago, Wednesday, 8 p.m.: TBA\n*Game 5 @ Chicago, Thursday, 8 p.m.: TBA\n*Game 6 @ New York, Sat. Oct. 24, 4 p.m.: TBA\n*Game 7 @ New York, Sun., Oct. 25, 8 p.m.: TBA\nROAD TO NLCS: The Cubs were shut out in the NLDS opener by the Cards, but bounced back to take three straight, outscoring St. Louis 20-17 in four games and hitting 10 homers, including nine in the final two wins at Wrigley. The Cubs won all seven games against Mets this season, but all came before New York picked up Yoenis Cespedes at the trade deadline. The Cubs had seven more regular season wins than the Mets but were the final team to make it onto the dance floor, playing in the very deep NL Central. The Cubs last reached the NLCS in 2003, losing to the Marlins. The Mets after losing Game 4 at home to the Dodgers, travelled cross-country and pulled it together Thursday to beat Zack Greinke 3-2. The Mets outscored the Dodgers 22-18 in five games and are in the NLCS for the first time since 2006, when they lost to the Cardinals.\nSTARTERS: For the Mets, RHP Jacob deGrom didn’t have his best stuff in Game 5, but held it together long enough for his team to take the lead. That’s a good sign. RHP Matt Harvey is expected to make two starts vs. the Cubs, while RHP Noah Syndergaard has lived up to advance billing after being acquired from the Jays. The Cubs can compete in the series with the ability to pitch LHP Jon Lester and RHP Jake Arrieta in four, perhaps five of seven games. But beyond the big two they struggle. EDGE: Mets.\nBULLPEN: The Mets have power arms coming out of the ’pen led by CL Jeurys Familia, with 43 saves and a 1.85 ERA. The Mets acquired RHP Tyler Clippard at the deadline and his presence as a former closer helps. The Cubs have CL Hector Rondon in the post-season spotlight for the first time with a 6-4 record, a 1.67 ERA and 30 saves. The Cubs in this century have had bullpen woes. EDGE: Mets.\nLINEUP: The Mets saw 2B Daniel Murphy step up into a leadership role in the Dodgers series, with seven hits, three homers and five RBIs. They surged down the stretch with a red-hot CF Yoenis Cespedes, acquired at the deadline, and a finally healthy 3B David Wright. But Wright is struggling and the Dodgers attacked Cespedes successfully with high heat. The Cubs are youthful and talented with great young hitters like 1B Anthony Rizzo, 3B Kris Bryant, OF Kyle Schwarber. SS Addison Russell is iffy. The Cubs hitters have used the longball to win and handled pressure like veterans. EDGE: Cubs\nINTANGIBLES: The Cubs have not advanced this deep into the playoffs since ’03 when needing one win in the final two games, with their two best starters, it was “ Hello, Mr. Bartman .” The young Cubs have not seen this type of pressure, but genius MGR Joe Maddon is a lightning-rod for attention. The Mets have relied on their starting pitching and a division that included the Braves, Marlins and Phillies that combined to go 84 games under .500. The Mets MGR Terry Collins is a different personality than the early-career hot head that tolerated nothing short of perfection from his players. EDGE: Cubs\nPICK TO WIN: Cubs in 7.\nGRIFF’S ’15 PICKS: 2-2\nMore on thestar.com\nMaple Leafs-Pittsburgh Penguins: Game preview\nHelp us home in on Jays’ most memorable homer", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:56:01.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
