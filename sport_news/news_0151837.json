At INMETCO and Nalco, the students attended a presentation in their honor instead of a tour because special safety gear is necessary to go into those plants. \nINMETCO, located on 92 acres, has 93 full-time and 14 part-time employees. It is a leading recycler of batteries in North America. \nJohn Onuska, manager of environment, health and safety at INMETCO, greeted the students and then a video presentation was given. Onuska said the group from the Lawrence County Career & Technical Center had a lot of questions about what kind of work was available and what skills they needed. \nJen Brown, a Riverside guidance counselor, said the Riverside students were from industrial arts classes and wood and metal shop. \n\"They are interested because they want to stay here in Ellwood City, and they will need jobs,\" Brown said. \nRiverside student Ian Mondine, who lives in Franklin Township, is in the 11th grade. He said he liked the tour of the Forge because he got to see the actual process happening. \n\"Actually, I didn't even know INMETCO was here,\" Mondine said. \"I learned about it today. It is pretty interesting. When I graduate, I'm going straight into work, grunt work.\" \nOnuska told the students that wherever they get a job, the important thing is to be dependable, trustworthy and loyal. \nStacy Court, INMETCO's human resources and benefits administrator, who is in charge of hiring, said that no matter where you work, it is important to show up on time, do a good job and further your education. \n\"When someone applies for a job, I check everywhere they worked before,\" Court said. \"We are looking for people who show up for work on time and are good workers. Our turnover here is small. But we need electricians first; second would be welders and mechanics. Our maintenance people must have all three skills.\" \nRiverside 11h-grader Cody Stang, who lives in North Sewickley Township, enjoyed touring Ellwood City Forge best. \n\"INMETCO was interesting, too. When I graduate, I would like to work with wood or metal,\" Stang said. \nShawn Jacobs, a Riverside senior who lives in North Sewickley Township, enjoyed learning the basics of what INMETCO does. He takes machine shop in school. \n\"I go to school full time, and I work as a carpenter after school and on weekends. My career will be as a carpenter,\" Jacobs said. \nCourtney Sutter, of North Sewickley Township, is in the ninth grade at Riverside and takes the graphic arts class. She was one of 10 girls from the school taking part in the tour. Sutter said she was interested in the presentations but doesn't have any plans for the future yet. \nThe students visited two plants in the morning, and after lunch in Ewing Park provided by the Ellwood City Area Chamber of Commerce, they visited another. \nLori Hilliard, the chamber's executive director, planned and organized Manufacturing Day. \n“There is an increasing demand for highly skilled professionals in the manufacturing sector who can design, program and operate technology,\" Hilliard said. \"The average age of a manufacturing employee is 56, and between now and 2020, there will be an unprecedented shortage of skilled workers who will need to be replaced. \n\"In the Ellwood City and Wampum area, there are numerous businesses that will need trained manufacturing professionals, engineers and machinists. It’s a win-win situation for our area when those positions can be filled by local graduates with the proper training and education.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:35:46.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
