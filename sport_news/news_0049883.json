The traders, under the banner of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, today held a meeting with MC Joint Commissioner Virender Chaudhary in which they submitted that the existing parking lots in the markets should remain open for vehicles up to their capacity. The remaining vehicles should be diverted to alternative parking lots such as nearby schools, community centres and open grounds (already identified by the MC) during the festival days so that roads do not get congested. These alternative parking lots should be managed by the MC with the assistance of the traffic police, the traders suggested. Beopar Mandal president Charanjiv Singh said no stalls of vendors should be allowed in the parking lots. A limited number of stalls as per the availability of space should be allowed on the pedestrian path between the verandah and the parking lots, and these should be allotted to shopkeepers on a priority basis. Anil Vohra of the Beopar Mandal said alternative places such as the Circus Ground, Sector 17, and Exhibition Ground, Sector 34, should be provided to small vendors, who do not own shops in markets and want to sell their products during the festival days. MC Joint Commissioner Virender Chaudhary told the traders to submit their suggestions in writing, which would be placed before MC Commissioner Bhawna Garg for a final decision. MC decision\nThe MC had decided that the parking areas in the markets in Sectors 15, 19 and 22 would be kept free from vehicles during the festival season and alternative parking space would be identified for shopkeepers and visitors. It was also decided that the UT police, the traffic police and the MC enforcement wing would work as a team to identify alternative parking space and take a written consent from the market associations concerned. The restrictions will come into force on October 27 and continue till November 11 (Diwali). Permission slipsfor vendors\nThe MC also decided that vendorsâ€™ names, stall area and location should be clearly mentioned on the permission slips to be issued by the MC to them for setting up stalls in Sectors 15, 19 and 22 during the festive season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:23:43.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
