(Mark J. Terrill / AP) Brad Biggs Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune \"I don't even know what 'pro style' means anymore the NFL is in shotgun so much.\" Jared Goff's college coach \nJay Cutler is the Bears quarterback of the present, but his future in Chicago is up in the air. \nHe is 32, and whether he has a career revival this season — his seventh with the Bears — the organization needs a long-term plan for the position. \nThe new regime thought long and hard about Cutler's status when it took over in January, and while he is off to a solid start with offensive coordinator Adam Gase, he had strong beginnings with Marc Trestman, Mike Martz and Ron Turner. The Bears can't ignore the quarterback landscape. And they haven't. \nThe Bears have been scouting quarterbacks for the 2016 draft. General manager Ryan Pace attended the Michigan State-Michigan game Oct. 17 in Ann Arbor to watch the Spartans' Connor Cook. In September, Pace and his top personnel men saw Cal's Jared Goff play against Washington. \nBoth are projected to be the top quarterbacks selected in the draft. Will either be available when the Bears — 2-4 as they take this week off — are on the clock? Time will tell, but the Bears are doing their homework. \nThe Tribune's Brad Biggs offers an extensive look at Cook and Goff, having traveled to watch both play and talking with more than a dozen key decision makers around the league about the quarterback prospects. \n••• \nPASADENA, Calif. — His Bear Raid offense looked like it had been snarled in a bear trap for the second straight week, but when Cal offensive coordinator Tony Franklin emerged from the visitors locker room at the Rose Bowl on Thursday night, he was happy to explain why the spread shouldn't detract from Jared Goff as the nation's top quarterback prospect. \nThe 6-foot-4, 215-pound true junior has brought the program back to relevance and was in the Heisman Trophy conversation before a five-interception meltdown Oct. 10 in a30-24 loss at Utah. All of the turnovers weren't pinned on Goff and the Bears had 11/2 weeks to ready for a UCLA team that came in limping on defense, having surrendered 124 points and a mind-boggling 857 yards rushing in its previous three games. \nBut then UCLA, whose true freshman quarterback Josh Rosen was the star of the night, thumped the No. 20 Bears 40-24. It came a little more than a month after Texas defensive coordinator Vance Bedford, a former secondary coach for the NFL's Bears, said of Goff: \"This is Aaron Rodgers. He's the real deal.\" \nNo, scouts are not drawing that same parallel to the famous Cal alum, but they are mighty intrigued by Goff, who completed 32 of 53 passes for 295 yards and three touchdowns Thursday. Nineteen were present Thursday, including three general managers and three NFL college scouting directors. (Bears general manager Ryan Pace along with three of his scouts saw Goff defeat Washington in September). \nDoes Goff have the skills to succeed where so many other college spread quarterbacks have failed miserably? By all appearances, things are unraveling as Colin Kaepernick and Robert Griffin III, Johnny Manziel, Blaine Gabbert and Brandon Weeden, among others, have flamed out. \nEach season the line between spread and pro offenses becomes blurrier. According to Football Outsiders, 60.9 percent of all NFL snaps were from the shotgun or pistol formation in 2014. That's up from 47.5 percent just two years before and triple the rate of 20 percent as recently as 2006. According to STATS LLC, 77 percent of all passes in the NFL this season have been made from the shotgun, up 21 percent from 2010. \n\"The NFL wants to see what your skill set is and if you have it, they can teach anybody,\" Franklin said. \"They screw up making bad choices more than they do anything else and the biggest thing they do is blame somebody else. It's not rocket science. \n\"There are a lot of great quarterbacks who were spread quarterbacks and there are a lot of bad quarterbacks who were pro-style quarterbacks. But I don't even know what 'pro style' means anymore the NFL is in the shotgun so much.\" \nArizona Cardinals coach Bruce Arians took a torch to spread offenses during the scouting combine. \n\"So many times, you're evaluating a quarterback who has never called a play in the huddle, never used a snap count. They hold up a card on the sideline, he kicks his foot and throws the ball,\" said Arians, a wishbone quarterback at Virginia Tech in the early 1970s. \"That ain't playing quarterback.\" \nChallenges abound \nThe NFL can kick and scream or choose to adjust because colleges aren't ditching spread attacks, which are now the norm at high schools. \nBut the challenges for a quarterback coming from the spread are numerous. They rarely call a play in a huddle. They don't adjust the protections often at the line of scrimmage. A lot of reads are pre-determined or quarterbacks will read only half of the field. Nearly every snap is made from the shotgun. Footwork can require a total overhaul. \nBut Goff, who has completed 65.5 percent of his passes, has free reign to change Franklin's calls at the line by tweaking a route or protection or scrapping a play altogether and choosing something else. It's a freedom Franklin never has given a quarterback before, a sign of trust he has in Goff in his third season as starter. \nWhen you watch Goff from field level, it's clear he's every bit as tall as listed and maybe just approaching his declared weight. But he turned 21 on Oct. 14 and with a year or two in the NFL, his frame will fill out. He holds the ball high and possesses a quick and smooth release. He can snap the ball off with good velocity when needed and his arm is strong enough on the wide college hashes to make a throw from one side to the far boundary. He doesn't always spin the ball tightly but he gets it there. His footwork, even in pregame drills, jumps out. It's quick and balanced. \n\"He has what we call typewriter feet where his feet are hot and they're moving and he can work and find throwing lanes,\" Franklin said. \"We want (quarterbacks) to look like Peyton Manning and he does.\" \nAgainst UCLA, the game got away from Cal as its porous defense allowed scores on the first seven possessions. But Goff displayed a calm presence in the face of pressure. \nOn third-and-8 in the first quarter, Goff stepped past the defensive end, who came unblocked up the middle on a twist, to complete a 9-yard pass. In the second quarter, Goff was flushed from the pocket but made a perfect strike on the run to the tight end for 14 yards. On the next play, Goff started looking right before scanning across the field and locating a receiver for a 36-yard completion, climbing in the pocket to make the throw. \nWithout his starting left tackle, Goff's below average offensive line, in the estimation of scouts, was worse and his average wide receivers didn't gain much separation. Cal offered no threat of a running game and UCLA was able to pin back its ears and hunt as it sacked Goff five times. \n\"We got punched in the mouth two weeks in a row now and we're going to have to respond one way or the other,\" Goff said. \"I think we're going to respond the correct way. It hurts. I can't lie to you.\" \nScouts impressed \nGoff's parents both went to Cal and his father Jerry was a major-league catcher for parts of six seasons. It's unknown at this point if he will declare for the NFL draft or return for a fourth college season before heading to the NFL in 2017. \n\"I thought he was poised in the pocket,\" one general manager said after Thursday's game. \"I like the way he maneuvered. He is a pure pocket passer and he has a good pocket presence. Not overly mobile but enough where he can gain some yards. Two things for a quarterback: You need to be poised and you need to be accurate. He is both.\" \nOne national scout drew the parallel to the Falcons' Matt Ryan and called Goff more athletic. \n\"Jared has improved from last year in terms of his poise in the pocket,\" the scout said. \"He has a good release and a good arm up the seams. Your concerns are adaptability. … But you can see a kid like this, how well he plays from the pocket, the mechanics and his footwork. You're looking for the transferable skills.\" \nThen there's a matter of intangibles. Goff's background is squeaky clean, so much so that believe or not teams want to dig deeper. If Goff is that nice of a guy, can he be the leader your team requires? After all, you can't have a player running the huddle teammates will walk over. \n\"Andrew Luck is as nice as they come,\" one college scouting director said, \"and he's still respected by his teammates. There are different kinds of leadership. Marcus Mariota wasn't a grab-you-by-the-throat guy and you're not going to throw him away because he's not a (jerk). These guys are too hard to find.\" \nFranklin maintains there were fiery moments for Goff in the 45-44 victory over Texas on Sept. 19, and he has shown it in practice also. \n\"It was spicy and back and forth,\" Franklin said. \"Jared does it when he needs to do it.\" \nRegardless, a congenial persona isn't going to derail Goff. And the NFL will adapt to spread quarterbacks when they have skills that translate to the pro game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:08:03.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
