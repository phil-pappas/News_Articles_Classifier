That changed in a hurry before a sellout crowd at sunny Michie Stadium as the Duke defense held the Army option in check, limiting the Black Knights to 44 yards rushing on 26 carries in the decisive first half and 113 for game on 49 tries. Army entered averaging 287.8 yards rushing per game, 5.6 per carry.
