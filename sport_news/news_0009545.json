South African Ernie Els had a disappointing opening round coming in at 74. \n\n\"Today is a lucky day. I didn't hit it good with my tee shots but I had a good short game. I could make a lot of birdies. This is a great round for me. I'm happy and feel fantastic with a 29 coming in,\" said Thitiphun. \n\nFresh from his Presidents Cup debut where he was disappointed to not deliver a point for the Internationals, Lahiri bounced back in style with a five-birdie round. \n\n\"I think it was a solid round of golf. I misread a few. Hopefully I can make those six or eight footers through the rest of the week,\" he said. \n\nLeading scores (par 71) \n\n64 - Thitiphun Chuayprakong (THA) \n\n65 - Jeunghun Wang (KOR), Siddikur Rahman (BAN) \n\n66 - Scott Hend (AUS), Javi Colomo (ESP), Brett Munson (USA), Anirban Lahiri (IND) \n\n67 - Masahiro Kawamura (JPN), Jazz Janewattananond (THA), Chiragh Kumar (IND), Abhijit Chadha (IND), Rahil Gangjee (IND), Charlie Wi (KOR) Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:44:07.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
