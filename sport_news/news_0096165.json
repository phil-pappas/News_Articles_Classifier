Now 14-year-old Michelle Lucic is among the many children affected by bullying. \nMichelle said the bullying began as early as four years old. She decided to learn karate to combat the bullies and show them her strength. She quickly realized that karate teaches you much more than how to fight. \n“Karate is not just about physical activity it is not just about defending yourself it is about finding yourself and forming a person you want to be,” Michelle said. \nThrough karate Michelle said she became more confident and social. Ultimately, Karate helped lead her to other healthy coping mechanisms such as reading and writing. \n“I started to read. It literally cut whatever was going on out. Everything was blocked when I read a book. It was like I was in a different world,” Michelle explained. “I thought what if I wrote a book. What if I could do that to someone, if I could erase someone’s thoughts about the real world.” \nMichelle decided to write a book entitled, “I Am Back with Revenge.” It is a fictional book inspired by her own personal experiences. At 14, her book is finished and published. Through both karate as well as the experience of writing a book she’s realized where strength truly lies. \nMichelle explained, “A lot of crap can happen in your life and it depends on how you deal with it . Will you make a better person out of yourself and find out ways to set it aside or fix it or will you let it break you?” \nYou can purchase book here here . Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.
