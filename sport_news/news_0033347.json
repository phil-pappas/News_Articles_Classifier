We luckily achieved what we set out to achieve. We have a tender through which we have tied up with Star Sports. This is path-breaking.\n\"It was an initiative by NRAI executive to bring in electronic media. There has been huge investment in terms of money and time. This was very necessary in view of corporate sponsorship in future,\" Raninder told reporters.\nThe Asian Air Gun Championship is the first international shooting competition in India after a gap of almost five years. The last time when fans were able to see their shooting stars in top-level action was during the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:46:26.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
