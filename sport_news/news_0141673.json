Atletico 02 Oct 2015 17:31:52 \ncomments \nReal Madrid will aim to cap a miserable week for Atletico Madrid on Sunday when they face their local rivals in a fixture that has not gone too well for the 10-time European champions in recent times. \nReal dominated the derby for well over a decade, going unbeaten for 25 matches against the Rojiblancos in any competition from 2000 to 2013, but have found things much tougher over the last few years. \nThey have won just one of their past eight fixtures against Atletico and have to go back to the 2012/13 campaign for their last Primera Division win over their neighbours. \nHowever, Real, who edged out Atletico 1-0 in the Champions League quarter-finals in their last meeting back in April, head into the match at the Vicente Calderon in buoyant mood. \nThey are still unbeaten under new coach Rafael Benitez and, although they were held to a disappointing home draw by La Liga last weekend, bounced back with a 2-0 Champions League victory at Malmo on Wednesday. \nCristiano Ronaldo, having not found the back of the net in Real's previous three games, scored both goals against the Swedish side to become Real's all-time top scorer with 324 goals in 308 games. \nHe has one more goal than former club captain Raul. \nBenitez said of the Portuguese star on his club's website: \"If we're talking about the history of Real Madrid and the club's goalscorers, it's worth pointing out that he has needed less time (six years) to achieve this feat and that makes what he's doing all the more remarkable. \n\"I hope he doesn't have a limit and he continues to score.\" \nAtletico, meanwhile, will be hoping to use the derby to salvage something from what has been a dismal week so far. \nDiego Simeone's side lost 1-0 at Villarreal to drop to fifth in La Liga last weekend, two points adrift of third-place Real, before falling 2-1 at home to Benfica in Wednesday's Champions League. \nFor the first time in their history, Villarreal top the Primera Division standings and are one point clear of Barcelona. \nThe Yellow Submarine make the short journey to Valencia on Sunday to face winless Levante. \nVillarreal followed up their triumph over Atletico with a 1-0 victory over Viktoria Plzen in Thursday's Europa League. \nBarca are decimated by injuries as they prepare to face struggling Sevilla at the Sanchez Pizjuan stadium. \nAndres Iniesta suffered a left hamstring injury during Tuesday's Champions League win over Bayer Leverkusen to leave the defending champions with only 17 available players, including two goalkeepers. \nSevilla have only one win in six league games and go into the clash after a 2-0 European defeat to Juventus. \nValencia will look to end a positive week on the right foot when they travel to Bilbao to face stuttering Athletic. \nLos Che clinched their second league win of the campaign last weekend, a 1-0 triumph over bottom side Granada, and then also prevailed 1-0 in the Champions League at Lyon thanks to Sofiane Feghouli's goal. \nMalaga, 18th in the standings and with just three points, host Real Sociedad on Saturday. \nEibar travel to the Canary Islands to face Las Palmas looking to maintain their unbeaten run on the road. \nThe Basque minnows have won one and drawn two of their three away games so far. \nAlso on Saturday, Espanyol will attempt to bounce back from last weekend's 3-0 defeat at Deportivo La Coruna when they host Sporting Gijon. \nGranada have lost four straight games heading into their game against Depor while Rayo Vallecano host Real Betis on Sunday without defender Antonio Amaya. \nAmaya was sent off during his team's 3-2 defeat at Sevilla for dissent and will begin serving a three-match ban this weekend. Celta Vigo face Getafe on Friday night. Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:34:51.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
