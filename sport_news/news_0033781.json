A man wearing dark-coloured pants and a grey top walks up to her slowly, approaches her, and then quickly darts away towards a subdivision. Police allege the man grabbed the woman’s buttocks.\nPolice say the man is wanted in connection with at least four other sexual assaults in the general vicinity that have occurred between Aug. 18 and Tuesday.\nIn one incident that occurred on Sept. 25 at about 9:25 a.m., police say an 18-year-old woman was walking on Aspenwood Drive when she was pushed to the ground. The suspect allegedly tried to pull clothes off the woman, before a passerby intervened and the suspect fled the scene.\nPolice say the suspect is a white male, between 20 and 25 years old. He stands about five-feet-five inches tall, and weighs 125 to 130 pounds.\nHe has been seen wearing a hooded sweatshirt and pants.\nInvestigators believe the suspect is intentionally targeting small, thin females, who may be using their cellphones while walking or listening to music with headphones.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact police at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7071, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).\nRelated Stories Police warn man prowling Newmarket for sex assault victims", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:05:30.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
