(AP) - A 46-year-old suburban Detroit woman has been charged after authorities said she fired a shot at the tires of an SUV to stop fleeing shoplifters in a Home Depot parking lot.\nOakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper said Tuesday that Tatiana Duva-Rodriguez of Clarkston faces one count of reckless use, handling or discharge of a firearm.\nThe shooting occurred Oct. 6 in Auburn Hills, northwest of Detroit. The shoplifters escaped, but two men were arrested a few days later and charged with retail fraud.\nAuthorities have said the woman who fired the shot had a concealed weapons permit, but wasn't being threatened by the shoplifters.\nCooper said the slug could have struck someone else.\nAn arraignment date for Duva-Rodriguez has not been set. A number listed for her was disconnected.\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
