The decisive Game 5 will be played Wednesday in Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium.\nIf you're a fan of building narratives, the easy one for Game 4 is the experienced Royals coming back to beat a young Astros team that hasn't yet learned what it takes to close out a postseason series. I'm not a fan of that line of thinking, though I'm sure it'll be discussed somewhere. Here are six things to know about Game 4.\n1. The Royals found some RISP magic in the 8th inning. \nThe Astros went into the eighth inning leading 6-2. They were six outs from punching their ticket to the ALCS. Forty minutes later, the Astros were trailing 7-6. Kansas City put together a miraculous five-run rally in the top of the eighth, stringing together singles and walks and productive outs. Here's the rally :\nGoing into that inning, the Royals were 3 for 21 with runners in scoring position in the ALDS. They then went 3 for 7 with two walks with runners in scoring position in the eighth. The Moustakas and Butera at-bats stand out in particular. Each saw 10 pitches from Luke Gregerson , wearing him down for Alex Gordon , who drove in the go-ahead run with a ground out.\nAlso, Gregerson got some help from home plate umpire Ron Kulpa to escape the inning. The called strike three to Alcides Escobar for the final out was questionable:\nCall hurts #Royals Strike 3 should be ball 2 Top 8 Gregerson vs Escobar 8% call same 3.1in from edge pic.twitter.com/W2yFZpmBlx \nâ€” Royals Strike Zone (@RoyalsUmp) October 12, 2015 Ultimately it did not matter. Eric Hosmer swatted a two-run home run in the top of the ninth to give the Royals some insurance.\n2. The Astros had not blown a four-run lead all season. \nDuring the regular season the Astros never once blew a four-run lead in 2015. They blew several three-run leads, but never once a four-run lead. They blew their first one at a very, very bad time. Houston's bullpen has allowed 10 runs and 20 baserunners in 10 1/3 innings in the ALDS.\nThe Royals, by the way, tied their largest comeback of the 2015 season at four runs.\n3. Correa's monster game should not be forgotten. \nIt's probably going to get lost in the shuffle given Kansas City's massive comeback, but Carlos Correa had one of those \"look everyone, I'm a megastar!\" breakout games. At 21 years and 20 days, he became the sixth youngest player in history to hit a homer in the postseason . Only Andruw Jones, Bryce Harper, Miguel Cabrera, Mickey Mantle and Manny Machado were younger.\nCorrea did more than just hit a home run, however. He hit a solo homer in the third, doubled in another run in the fifth, hit a two-run home run in the seventh, and singled to start the ninth. The young shortstop went 4 for 4 with a double, two homers and 4 RBI. That's an all-time great game given his age and the fact it was in the postseason. The Astros may have lost in spectacular fashion, but boy, their shortstop is jaw-droppingly good.\n4. Someone finally hit a home run with someone on base. \nThe Royals and Astros combined for nine home runs in Games 1-2 of the ALDS, but all nine were solo home runs. Gordon, Salvador Perez , George Springer , Chris Carter , Lorenzo Cain , Colby Rasmus (two) and Kendrys Morales (two) did the long ball honors.\nIn the second inning of Game 4, someone finally hit a home run with a runner on base. Lance McCullers Jr. walked Mike Moustakas on six pitches with one out, then Perez followed with an impressive opposite field two-run home run:\nYour browser does not support iframes. \nPerez hit a career-high 21 home runs during the regular season and only one was to the opposite field. (Thirteen were pulled, seven were hit to dead center.) Only six of Perez's 65 career regular season home runs were hit the other way.\nCorrea and Hosmer also hit two-run home runs later in the game.\n5. McCullers buried the Royals with breaking balls. \nComing into the season, Baseball America ranked McCullers as the 11th best prospect in Houston's system in their 2015 Prospect Handbook, saying he has \"a double-plus breaking ball that has been described within the organization as a curveball and outside of it as a slider.\" Double-plus means top of the line, basically.\nThe Astros called McCullers up in mid May -- he skipped Triple A and came up from Double A -- and he threw 53.9 percent fastballs and 36.4 percent breaking balls during the regular season. (The other 9.7 percent were changeups.) It worked for him. McCullers had a 3.22 ERA (125 ERA+) with 129 strikeouts in 125 2/3 innings.\nIn Game 4 on Monday, the 22-year-old McCullers leaned on that \"double-plus\" breaking ball big time. Here is his pitch breakdown via Brooks Baseball :\nYes, McCullers threw more breaking balls (54) than fastballs (51). That is not at all common, especially for a starting pitcher. But this is the postseason, and emphasizing that \"double-plus\" breaking ball was his best chance to win, so McCullers did it. The Royals couldn't touch him either. Just two hits in 6 1/3 innings. McCullers struck out seven and got 17 swings and misses out of 110 total pitches.\nBy the way, at 22 years and 10 days, McCullers was the youngest starting pitcher in the postseason since Madison Bumgarner started Game 4 of the 2010 World Series at 21 years and 91 days old.\n6. The review on Gore's stolen base changed everything. \nWith the Astros leading 3-2 in the seventh, McCullers hit Perez with a fastball to put the tying run on base. Perez was replaced by pinch-runner extraordinaire Terrance Gore , who is a perfect 11 for 11 in big league stolen base attempts. He also went 42 for 44 in minor league stolen base attempts in 2015.\nSo, naturally, Gore immediately stole second base to put himself in scoring position. Gordon struck out for the second out, then Gore took off for third with Alex Rios at the plate. Gore was safe ... until the Astros challenged. Here's the video and various replays:\nYour browser does not support iframes. \nIt's a ticky-tack review -- Gore's foot was off the base for an only an instant after the impact of sliding into the base propelled him backward -- but credit Astros manager A.J. Hinch and his staff for taking advantage. The replay system was intended for egregious mistakes, not nitpicky stuff like that, but it is what it is.\nAnyway, had the call been upheld, the entire complexion of the inning changes. The Royals would have had the tying run on third with two outs, so while a sacrifice fly or RBI ground out wasn't in play, a wild pitch or passed ball was still possible. Also, Will Harris and Jason Castro may have changed their pitch selection to avoid a wild pitch, so Rios could have seen more fastballs. The caught stealing changed everything.\nThe extra 90 feet might not seem like a huge deal, but I thought it was totally worth the risk. Gore is an elite runner, baserunners were 7 for 7 in steal attempts with Harris on the mound this year, and Castro has only thrown put 24.9 percent of base stealers over the last four years. It didn't work out because of this:\nI know it doesn't seem like a big deal given the outcome of the game, but boy, that review really changed the game. If Gore is safe, the pitch selection changes, maybe the bullpens get used differently ... who knows?\nWhat we do know is that the Royals will host a decisive Game 5 on Wednesday.\n\nThe Royals made a huge eighth inning comeback to win Game 4.
