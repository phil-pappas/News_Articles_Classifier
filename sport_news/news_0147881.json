I guess that's a good thing,\" said US team member and world number five Rickie Fowler after Tuesday's first official practice day at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club in Incheon, South Korea.\n\"Usually stuff like that doesn't bother me or the guys too much I think in practice rounds. It will be interesting come tournament play, come Thursday,\" added the 26-year-old.\n\"I didn't notice it too much while we were hitting,\" said US veteran of all 10 previous Presidents Cups Phil Mickelson. \"There was so much of it, we tuned it out. I feel like it will be the same for everybody.\"\nSouth African Branden Grace said the unusually noisy crowds might give his team mates an edge on the Americans, as they play more events in Asia.\n\"When you come to Asia you expect it,\" Grace told AFP. \"As European Tour players we've been exposed to it a little bit more than the US guys.\n\"You just mustn't let it get to you. Tomorrow might be a bit more hectic out there.\n\"Golf is so huge in Asia and the people here just love taking photos, I don't think there's any other way to put it.\n\"It gets nuts out there sometimes but it's fun. They all mean well.\"\nThe frenzied atmosphere, even on the first practice day, came as a bit of a culture shock to some of the US players such as Jimmy Walker, who do not venture outside the PGA Tour often.\n\"At the beginning today we were like, 'Holy cow, this is unbelievable',\" Walker told AFP.\n\"After a while, really, there was just so much of it going on, it just becomes white noise. It's not a big deal. It's not like when you're at home where one click or ring will really stand out. Here it's just constant.\n\"Never once today was I thrown off by the clicks and they were going off a lot. It was fine.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-06T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:42:53.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
