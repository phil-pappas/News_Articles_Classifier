(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) \nLONDON (AP) — Fourie du Preez crossed in the left corner with five minutes to go for South Africa to defeat Wales 23-19 in an enthralling start to the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals on Saturday. \nThe lead changed six times in a match in which 79,500 spectators at Twickenham dared not leave their seats, and it took a moment of brilliance to finally separate teams which overcame crippling starts to the tournament to get this far. \nWith the scrum feed, South Africa wheeled it toward the left touchline. No. 8 Duane Vermuelen broke away with the ball and drew replacement scrumhalf Lloyd Williams and winger Alex Cuthbert. Du Preez, lingering on the open side, suddenly flashed into view and the Springboks captain received a back pass from Vermuelen and a free, curving sprint into the corner. \nThe try wasn’t converted, but Wales suddenly needed a try to win, and didn’t look like getting it in the last minutes, pinned in their own half. \nSo South Africa, which was shocked by Japan in its opener, advanced to only its second semifinal in this century, and awaited the winner from the following match in Cardiff between New Zealand and France. \nAs the South Africans celebrated, fulltime left Wales players doubled over or on their knees, hearts broken yet again by the Springboks. But the Welsh could be proud of their contribution, without virtually a full backline of injured stars. \nThey should have had a try in the first three minutes. Rookie center Tyler Morgan stripped counterpart Damian de Allende and began a counterattack which put the ball in the hands of prop Gethin Jenkins. He had the foresight to see Morgan unmarked on the far right, but threw a high miss-out pass that missed everyone. \nSouth Africa was under pressure for three more minutes, until No. 8 Toby Faletau was penalized for not releasing on the 22, and the Boks cleared. \nIn the next 10 minutes, Springboks flyhalf Handre Pollard landed three penalties and his Welsh oppposite Dan Biggar kicked one. \nThe Springboks led 9-3, and just when it appeared they might be getting away, Wales produced a try from nothing. Du Preez hit a clearing kick straight down the middle to Biggar, who launched an up and under back into South Africa’s quarter. \nWillie le Roux over-ran it and Biggar regathered, then passed with defenders all around him to scrumhalf Gareth Davies, who beat the cover to the right of the posts. \nBiggar converted for 10-9 and a first Welsh lead. \nIt lasted three minutes, until another penalty from Pollard. \nThe second quarter was played between the 22s, South Africa edging possession and Wales defending all across the field and forcing turnovers. Captain Sam Warburton was superb. \nWith a minute left in first-half regulation, Biggar booted a penalty from 47 meters which hit the right upright. They forced a scrum and, in injury time, Jamie Roberts straightened the attack, and Biggar was perfectly set up to land a dropped goal for a 13-12 lead at halftime. \nPollard finally missed a goalkick to start the second half, while Biggar extended Wales’ lead with a penalty from 46 meters and room to spare. When Leigh Halfpenny was injured and out of tournament reckoning, Wales was said to have lost a long-range goalkicker because anything over 40 meters was supposed to be beyond Biggar’s range. But the Welsh No. 10 has well and truly ended that notion and enhanced his reputation. \nHe also can tackle. He made big, move-stopping tackles on center Jesse Kriel on the left side, and Bryan Habana on the right. \nMeanwhile, Pollard kicked a dropped goal to cut the deficit to one, and his fifth penalty just after the hour gave South Africa the lead again at 18-16. \nMoments later, of course, Biggar landed his third penalty goal to regain the lead at 19-18 with 16 minutes to go. \nThe teams reloaded with replacements, and Biggar reluctantly left the field in the 74th for a head injury assessment. His pain was aggravated a minute later when du Preez scored the winning try.
