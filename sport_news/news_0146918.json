It was alleged by parents of one of the players that one of the four players, who were declared overage after a medical test, is playing in the Junior (U-15 and U-17) category of the Asian Badminton Championship which got underway in Kudus, Indonesia, on Wednesday.\n\nThe bone tests conducted by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Badminton Association of India (BAI) at Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital few days ago had revealed that four players - Siril Verma, Kalpita Sawant, Kanika Kanwal and Bhavya Rishi - were overage. One of these four girls was permitted to go to Indonesia and played matches for India on Wednesday.\n\nNo official reason was given for this and the Badminton Association of India (BAI) officials could not be contacted despite several attempts.\n\nA peeved parent of an U-15 player who was not allowed to take part in the championship, asked why a player was allowed to play even after being found overage.\n\nThe bone test was conducted only on the U-17 players and not on the U-15 players. Interestingly, the players, who were in both the U-15 and U-17 squads, did not undergo bone tests.\n\nThose players, who were only in the U-15 squad, were told by the officials that they cannot go through bone test because it would harm their body. Strangely, BAI had last conducted bone test on several U-15 players during the junior nationals.\n\nDr Trupti Bansod, mother of Malvika, who was selected in the U-15 girls team, does not believe the radiation is harmful for the kids. \"It is not correct to say that radiation during the bone test will affect the body of players below the age group of 15. I am a practising doctor and I can firmly say that these kids can bear the radiation. Although authorities are giving this official version of radiation, I am sure there must be some other reason why bone test was not conducted for the U-15 players. Someone did not want U-15 players to have bone tests\" said Dr Bansod.\n\nDr Bansod still does not understand why BAI treated the U-15 so shabbily. \"First they kept my daughter Malvika and other U-15 players in the hospital for several hours. Then they said that bone test will not be conducted. Next day, the BAI said they are not sending the U-15 team for the Junior Asian championship and if the players still want to participate they can go on their own. It was not possible for me to arrange Rs 80,000 for tickets barely a couple of hours before the scheduled flight to Indonesia.\n\n\"I am still clueless why all things happened at the last moment. Why the test was not conducted for U-15 players and only for the U-17 players? Why one player still went on to play despite found overage? Why there was no bone test for the common players who were in both the U-15 and U-17 team? Why hold a ten-day camp if you are not sending a U-15 team?,\" Dr Bansod asked.\n\n\"I am totally shattered. When I told Malvika that I could not manage Rs 80,000 for her ticket, she just broke down. I am feeling guilty that as a parent I am denying my daughter a chance to represent the country. As a middle-class family, it's difficult for us manage so much money on one tournament. We have to spend lot of money on other national-level tournaments throughout the year. Still, if we were told in advance by BAI that we have to bear the cost, we could have done something,\" said Dr Bansod.
