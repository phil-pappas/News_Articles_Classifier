(AP Photo/Hans Pennink) more > By   \nWEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) - A.J. Schurr came off the bench to run for two touchdowns and threw for the winning score to help Army beat Bucknell 21-14 on Saturday. \nSchurr connected with Edgar Poe, who won a jump ball over Nick O’Brien and ran all the way to the end zone for a 68-yard score, to put Army up with 4:44 left. Chris Carnegie intercepted R.J. Nitti on Bucknell’s ensuing drive to clinch it. \nFollowing a 44-3 rout by Duke last week, Army (2-5) won at home for the first time this season despite trailing at halftime 14-7. The Black Knights came back from a halftime deficit for the first time under second-year coach Jeff Monken, improving to 1-9 when down at the break. \nNitti finished 17 for 33 for 186 yards and Matt DelMauro added 105 on the ground for the Bison (3-3). \nArmy quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw, who missed two weeks with an ankle injury, got off to a hot start, rushing for 28 yards before he was shaken up on a quarterback keeper. He left with 7:35 to go in the first and didn’t return. \nSchurr, a senior, was picked off over the middle by Connor Golden on his first snap. The 6-foot safety corralled the floater with one hand. Golden finished with 13 tackles. \nNitti completed six of his first eight attempts and finished the first half with 135 yards passing and two touchdowns. \nHis counterpart struggled by comparison - until late. \nThrowing into triple coverage near midfield on third down, Schurr was picked off again by a diving Golden, setting Bucknell up on the 44 with 6:10 left in the first half. \nTwo plays later, Nitti connected with Will Carter, who managed to stay inbounds along the left sideline for a 35-yard touchdown. Bucknell led 6-0 after Jordan Smith blocked the extra point. \nArmy answered to take a 7-6 lead with 1:52 left in the half. After a Schurr fumble was overturned on review, he found an open Poe for 25 yards, his first completion. Schurr ran in from the 3 on the next play. \nWith Bucknell facing fourth-and-17 and running out of time before the break, Nitti hooked up with Bobby Kaslander for a 27-yard pass, then completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Owers with 26 seconds left in the half. \nA 2-point conversion gave Bucknell led 14-7 at the break. \nA 3-yard touchdown run by Schurr capped a 12-play, 72-yard drive and tied it with 1:43 to go in the third. \nEarly in the second quarter, Bucknell seemed poised to score first but had to settle for a 38-yard field goal attempt. A low snap allowed John Voit to give Army’s first blocked field goal in six years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:07:40.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
