Comment   Writer Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 5:32 PM Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 5:32 PM Mount Shasta, Calif. Mount Shasta High School cross country and track and field coach Steve Nesheim was inducted into his former high school’s Hall of Fame for coaching last week at College Park High in Pleasant Hill. Nesheim, who coached at College Park for 15 years, was praised, among many other things, for his “success at developing winning teams” as “the result of meticulous record keeping; thoughtful and innovative training applications; and the insistence that athletics be a positive experience open to anyone, regardless of ability. By instilling a sense of family among teammates, Nesheim created a program that now perpetuates itself.” The above and following information was included in Nesheim’s Hall of Fame bio: “Over the course of his 15 year tenure, Nesheim coached shot put, discus, pole vault and high jump, in addition to his specialty, middle and long distance running. “Steve also designed the Hidden Valley Park cross country course; and created the Ed Sias Invitational, one of the premier courses in all of California. Hundreds of teams and thousands of athletes have competed on this course, named for College Park’s Hall of Fame coach and contributor Ed Sias Sr. “Coach Nesheim has left behind a legacy of ‘personal bests’ as he coached, taught and mentored his athletes, both girls and boys in track and field and in cross country, to 10 league championships with numerous individual champions and state finalists. “Perhaps the most telling fact of a coach’s/teacher’s impact on their student athletes, is that the Falcons are currently coached by three of Nesheim’s former athletes. “Steve is ‘still doing his thing’ for Mount Shasta High School in Mount Shasta as the cross country and track and field coach for the Bears, and lives in the woods with his wife Heidi. “Coach Nesheim is proudly welcomed into the College Park Athletic Hall of Fame, Class of 2015.”   Writer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:09:43.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
