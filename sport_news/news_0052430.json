To me he’s always been a tough out,” Dodgers manager Don Mattingly told reporters. “You kind of have to get him off stride and get the ball to certain spots (or) you’re in trouble.” \nMets starter Jacob deGrom (2-0) struggled early on but regrouped and finished strong. He gave up two runs in the first but settled and allowed six hits with seven strikeouts and three walks in six innings. \nNoah Syndergaard relieved deGrom and worked a scoreless seventh before closer Jeurys Familia came on in the eighth for the six-out save. Familia retired all six batters he faced. \nGreinke (1-1), who might have pitched his last game for the Dodgers since he can opt out of his contract, gave up three runs on six hits with nine strikeouts and no walks in 6 2/3 innings. \nThe Mets jumped in front 1-0 in the first. With one out, Murphy’s double scored right fielder Curtis Granderson, who led off with an infield hit. \nFour consecutive singles in the bottom of the inning allowed the Dodgers to rally. \nThe opener of the best-of-seven NLCS is in New York today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:30:34.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
