Andy Pattenden said at the scene.\nShe has been identified by family and friends as Airsha Ahmed.\nHer seven-year-old sister was transported to hospital with serious injuries.\nThe children live in the area and attend the school, police confirmed.\nThe female driver involved in the incident remained at the scene.\n“They are speaking with officers at this time,” Pattenden said Thursday afternoon.\nSpeaking with CP24, an area resident said the incident was ‘upsetting.’\n“There’s a lot of traffic, and a lot of people fly down like there’s no speed limit,” the man, who identified himself only as Sam, said.\n“We’ve actually complained to the city before. Having this happen, maybe somebody will wake up and do something about it.”\nThe area was closed for several hours as police investigated. It has since reopened.\n“Right now, we’re appealing to anyone that might have seen anything in this area, who might have seen the collision, that haven’t spoken with our investigators yet to please come forward right away,” Pattenden said.\nPhotos A four-year-old child was struck and killed by a vehicle in Markham on Thursday, October 22, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:41:36.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
