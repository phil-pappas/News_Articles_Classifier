The Cardinal seek their fifth straight win following a season-opening loss at Northwestern and try to remain the only Pac-12 North team without a conference loss. \nKEY MATCHUP \nUCLA vs. Stanford RB Christian McCaffrey. The Bruins will have their hands full with one of the nation’s most versatile players. McCaffrey leads the Pac-12 and is second nationally with 229.8 all-purpose yards per game. He is a threat as a runner out of the backfield, a receiver in the slot or as a returner. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nUCLA: RB Paul Perkins. After becoming the first Bruins back to lead the conference in rushing since 2001 last year, Perkins has started strong again this season. He has rushed for 593 yards and seven TDs this year, averaging 5.8 ypc. \nStanford: RB Remound Wright. While McCaffrey is Stanford’s do-everything player, Wright is the goal-line specialist. He has 16 TDS in his last eight games, including seven on just 38 carries this season. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nStanford has won seven straight vs. UCLA for longest streak by either school in series history. … The Bruins have won five straight against ranked teams, their longest streak since a six-gamer in 1997-98. … UCLA has won 12 straight away from home since losing at Oregon Oct. 26, 2013. … Bruins WR Jordan Payton needs 35 yards receiving to move into the top 10 in school history. … Stanford has scored at least 31 points in each of the past four games. … Cardinal QB Kevin Hogan has 28 career wins and needs just three more to tie Andrew Luck’s school record for QBs. … Stanford has three home losses since 2010, tied for second fewest in nation behind Boise State’s two.
