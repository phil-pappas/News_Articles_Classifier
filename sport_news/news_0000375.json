The floor was slippery due to a layer of ice for hockey that lay below the basketball surface. \nPlayers on both sides complained about the floor. The Lakers’ Nick Young described it as “dangerous,” while Metta World Peace said it was “not a great floor.” Nick Young on the court: \"It was just too dangerous to play on, people slipping left and right.\" \n— Baxter Holmes (@BaxterHolmes) October 18, 2015 Mehta World Peace on the court: \"Hopefully next year they change it. It’s not a great floor, especially when you’ve got the MVP out there.\" \n— Baxter Holmes (@BaxterHolmes) October 18, 2015 \nThe Warriors’ Marreese Speights called it “scary” and “terrible.” That was a scary game!!! Court was terrible… Blessed that nobody didn't get hurt!!!! \n— Marreese Speights (@Mospeights16) October 18, 2015 \nReigning league MVP Stephen Curry even slipped on the court while making a move: Stephen Curry: \"I even slipped making a move and was able to catch myself and not lose the ball and still made a shot.\" \n— Diamond Leung (@diamond83) October 18, 2015 \nApparently the fans at the game were chanting for a refund when the game was called off: Fans here in San Diego are not happy and a huge \"RE-FUND!\" chant breaks out as the Warriors-Lakers game is called off. \n— Baxter Holmes (@BaxterHolmes) October 18, 2015 \nLuckily the Lakers heard the concerns and obliged: Fans that attended tonight's shortened game in San Diego can get a full refund after 12pm Monday at point-of-purchase. \n— Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) October 18, 2015 \nIt’s a nice gesture by the Lakers — that’s top notch customer service.
