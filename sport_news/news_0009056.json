At this point, the HOF isn't quite clear what that will entail. \nThe first phase of the visionary project includes the construction of new north stands and a fan plaza between the stadium and the Hall of Fame. \nA construction timeline has been created to ensure completion of the first phase in time for the 2016 Enshrinement Ceremony, NFL/Hall of Fame Game and Concert for Legends. \nAll three marquee events of the annual Enshrinement Weekend are held at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. \nHOF Village includes eight main components planned to drastically change the campus into a spectacular destination. The key elements of the $476 million development project are: \n• Hall of Fame Museum \n• Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium/Sports & Entertainment Complex \n• Hotel & Conference Center \n• Hall of Fame NFL Experience \n• Youth Fields \n• Center for Excellence (Athletic Performance & Safety; Corporate Excellence; Coaches and Officials academies) \n• \"Main Street Hall of Fame\" (retail/restaurant/office space) \nFollow WKYC's Hilary Golston on Twitter at @HilaryWKYC or \"like\" her on Facebook <!--iframe--> Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RTjFLL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:45:01.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
