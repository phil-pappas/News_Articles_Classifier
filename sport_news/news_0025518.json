They know they remain in the midst of the program’s best season in almost a decade, and they are confident they can turn it back in the right direction beginning with Friday’s trip to Heath. \n“You walk through the halls (at school) and you actually have people say, ‘Good game,’ and look at you different,” senior defensive end Ethan Chalfant said. “It’s a good feeling. With the tough losses that we’ve had, it’s rough, but we know what we need to do to overcome that.” \nThe players feed off the confidence that is being built not just in the locker room but in the entire community. A sense is growing that the program is on the rise. \n“It was always expected to lose. Now, it’s, ‘Oh, you have a pretty good chance this week.’ There is a lot more confidence,” said senior receiver Tristan Foor, who caught the game-winning touchdown in an overtime victory against Mount Gilead in Week 3. \n“For this being (coach Shawn Hinkle’s) first year, we are only 4-3, but it’s three more wins than last year. I think next year they will be just as good if not better than we are this year.” \nUnfortunately, the Vikings have encountered a new batch of adversity as this is the first time they have lost consecutive games this season. Chalfant said it was clear something was missing before they even left the bus this past Friday. \nThe Vikings made the three-hour trip to Hicksville and were competitive early before falling behind 14-0 at halftime. The game got away in the third quarter. \n“The last one was by far the farthest, and it was rough,” Chalfant said. “I don’t think our mental focus was all there the whole bus ride, and I think that affected us a lot.” \nSome early points could alleviate Northridge’s recent issues. Even in some of its victories, Northridge has not started fast. \nThe past two weeks, the Vikings never got going at all against unbeaten Johnstown and Hicksville, which is contending for a Division VII playoff berth. \n“We can’t come out slow like we have been,” senior linebacker Sam Doran said. “We need to come out and fire off the ball and do what we need to from the beginning.” \nLogan Garee gained 68 of Northridge’s 177 yards, but the Vikings were unable to find the end zone against the Aces. \nThe passing game has been solid this season, but the Vikings were forced to become one-dimensional because of the score. The Aces’ final two scores were on interceptions returned for touchdowns. \n“It’s our attitude,” Foor said. “We can’t keep having our heads down when someone is beating us. We can’t let that get pushed into our heads. We need to keep on going.” \nksnyder@newarkadvocate.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:09:45.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
