They clogged the aisles while he warmed up, angling smart phones and cameras.\nThe day was all about Kobe Bryant, despite his best efforts to pass on the attention.\nBryant played 12 minutes in his first game since undergoing surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff. And while the Lakers lost, 90-71, to the Utah Jazz and Bryant scored just five points on 1-of-6 shooting, Coach Byron Scott deemed his star’s debut a success.\n“Today was the first game he’s played in a long time,” Scott said. “(It was good) just to get his feet wet and get him back out there and get some of the rust off.”\nBryant, however, had little interest in assessing his own game, repeating softly that it “felt good.”\nBut asked about the play of the young teammates he has been asked to mentor, Bryant’s entire demeanor changed.\nOf D’Angelo Russell, the point guard selected No. 2 overall in the draft, Bryant said, “His vision is astronomical, man.”\nOn Julius Randle, who played in his first game since breaking his leg in last year’s regular-season opener: “I think he’s an animal, man. He’s competitive, extremely athletic and strong as a bull. That’s a great combination to work from.”\nScott told Bryant before the game that he was going to let the 37-year-old, who is in his 20th season with the Lakers, play the entirety of the first quarter and sit him for the rest of the night.\n“Tuesday I’ll probably play him a little bit more,” Scott said. “So I’m excited about that.”\nThe Stan Sheriff Center was filled with chants for Bryant to return throughout the fourth quarter, but Scott said he never entertained the notion.\n“As much as I love Hawaii,” Scott said, “it’s a much bigger picture than these two games.”\nALOHA SPIRIT, OR NOT\nA night after arriving in Honolulu, the Jazz was greeted with a team luau. Players wore floral shirts and leis and Utah’s five rookies learned to hula on stage.\n“I’ve told them I want them to embrace it,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said.\nThe Lakers, meanwhile, are taking a much more serious approach.\n“Like I said when we got here,” Scott said, “this is business.”\nNo surfing, no grass skirts, no team trip to the Pearl Harbor memorial.\nAny bonding that occurs for the Lakers hasn’t been organized by the team.\n“One of the reasons, as far as getting away for training camp is so guys can come together even more so and form that bond and that camaraderie,” Scott said. “So you’re not just going home after practice, you’re kind of making plans with one another to do things outside of basketball.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:33:47.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
