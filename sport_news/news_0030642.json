Every single shot counts. We think of scoring for the team.”\nJerome was led by sophomore Taby Robinson with a 75, followed by senior Madelynn Zhang with 81, Kiefer and junior Mariana Erana and senior Reagan Dilorio with 84s. The lowest four scores count, meaning one of the 84s was thrown out.\nCeltics coach C.D. Butcher said Kiefer’s selfless attitude exemplified the program.\n“We truly are a team,” he said. “We drive all over this state in a van together playing tournaments in order to get here. We play for October. We studied every single approach shot and every single green before the tournament. It wasn’t pretty golf, but we got it done. We expended a lot of mental energy to get this done.”\nTo put Jerome’s streak into perspective, the only other school to win two straight girls championships was Cincinnati Mount Notre Dame in 2002 and ’03. No other team has won more than three titles.\nIn the Division I boys tournament on the par-71 Scarlet Course, Cincinnati St. Xavier totaled 616 to edge Jerome by five strokes.\nJerome senior Cam Root and Central Crossing freshman Caleb Davern shot 152 to finish tied for fifth, 10 shots behind champ Will Kurtz of Hudson. Sophomore Trey Rath of Liberty was seventh at 154, Adam Stephens of Jerome ninth at 155.\nThe Celtics were trying to win their seventh championship and first since 2013, but they settled for their third runner-up finish.\nCoach Craig Zesiger said falling behind by 13 strokes after the first day was too much to overcome.\n“We had a phenomenal season,” he said. “We were 283-4. This stings a little bit because the championship is our goal. But hand it to St. Xavier. I’m sure every single one of our guys can find five strokes that they gave away.”\nRoot said he would rather be holding the team championship trophy than an all-state plaque. He hit 16 greens in regulation and landed his tee shot in the fairway 12 times.\n“It’s a little bittersweet,” he said. “It’s not what I wanted. We were too far back. We had to be within five or six shots after the first day.”\nDavern was the first-round leader with a 70, but he shot 85 in the second. He said a double-bogey on the sixth hole threw him off mentally.\n“I didn’t get it back after that,” he said. “(The chance to win) definitely was out there today. I started off very good. I was even par through five holes. I had a chance.”\nRath was beaming despite following a first-round 72 with an 82. The conditions were difficult, with gusting winds and a damp chill.\n“I just didn’t putt well, but I feel pretty good about this because making all-state was one of my goals,” he said. “I know I can compete with everybody in the state.”\nmznidar@dispatch.com\n@MarkZnidar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:56:02.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
