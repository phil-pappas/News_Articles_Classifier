They also beat the Bahrainis 2-1 last June at the Philippine Sports Stadium in Bulacan.\nIn fact, the Filipinos had numerous chances to score in the first half, with Phil Younghusband nearly heading home the opener off a right cross by Stephan Schrock.\nBut Bahrain found cracks on the Philippine defense which eventually resulted in Abdullatif’s goal that came off a short pass by teammate Sami Alhussaini.\nAdnan then capitalize on an Azkals foul when his shot off a wall of defenders caught Etheridge by surprise to double Bahrain’s lead.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:52:32.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
