His recent troubles started with the farmer agitation, for which he refused to accept the government's failure. Next came the controversy over the pardon to the Dera Sacha Sauda head, when in the first place SAD politics was involved in the strictures against the Dera. For the religious fallout, he has now written to the Akal Takht Jathedar, expressing his anguish, thereby suggesting he has no responsibility. For the police firing and the deaths caused, local officials have been blamed in a state-wide breakdown. Outside the state, it was expected of Badal that he should have spoken up over the reports of countrywide suppression of minority voices. After all, the SAD has a long claim to being a champion of the minorities and voiceless. Mr Badal's silence can only be explained in terms of 'coalition compulsion'. One unique attribute of the current upheaval in Punjab seems to be that it is leaderless, with villagers refusing to tone down, even on the urging of the few Sikh leaders that have emerged over the past few days. It may thus be safe to assume that this is an apolitical protest, and the result of not just the incidents of desecration but larger and deeper frustration with the lack of governance, if not misgovernance. The countryside is angry and the SAD government has been found lacking in focus and urgency. The repeated incidents of desecration of holy texts, however, point to a deliberate attempt at mischief. It would be futile to speculate on who could be responsible. But the protesters have to bear in mind that any mode of protest that makes people suffer will inevitably lead to confrontation with civilians as well as the police. The resultant tension will only make the work of mischief-mongers easier. To protest is a basic right, to maintain larger communal harmony is everyone's duty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:15:02.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
