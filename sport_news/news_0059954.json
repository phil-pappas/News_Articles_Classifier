Hilliard and Zaycoven Henderson return from a two game suspension while sophomore Otaro Alaka will likely see the field for the first time in 2015 after recovering from injury.\nNevada has never played a member of the SEC or in front of a crowd of 100,000+. It has the chance to do both Saturday and bring chaos to College Station should it pull off the upset.\nWhen Nevada has the ball\nJunior QB Tyler Stewart faces a stout defensive line from Texas that will bring pressure early and often. Stewart threw for two touchdowns in a 44-20 loss to No. 20 Arizona, completing a career high 18 passes on the afternoon.\nTo this point in the season, the Wolf Pack offense appears to slightly favor the run in terms of both production and attempts. Leading the way is Junior RB Don Jackson with 215 yards and two TD's on the year.\nMistakes will need to be non-existent on Saturday on offense to have a shot at victory.\nWhen home team has the ball\nLast week against Ball State, head coach Kevin Sumlin didn't let up on the offensive side in the first half, jumping out to a 49-3 lead. With victory appearing to be secure, he was able to mix in an abundance of players who otherwise may not have seen action in a tight contest. Expect the same this Saturday should this game play similar.\nA&M will likely continue to enforce their commitment to being physical up front, incorporating the run game effectively, and working out the final kinks before conference play begins against Arkansas the following week.\nPrediction\nWith the line of the contest hovering around a 30-point victory for Texas A&M, the Wolf Pack pack will need to play a near-perfect 60 minutes of football to remain in the game with the Aggies.\nSophomore QB Kyle Allen has another early exit for the Aggies, allowing former Allen QB Kyler Murray a chance for more game reps and a chance to further develop his passing game. The already stout A&M defense incorporate Alaka, Henderson, and Hilliard into the fold and cause fits for the Nevada offense from morning into the early afternoon.\nNevada may appear to be in the contest early, but ultimately fade away as the Aggies cruise to a comfortable victory.\nScore: A&M 52, Nevada 13\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland"], "published": "2015-09-17T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:29:45.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
