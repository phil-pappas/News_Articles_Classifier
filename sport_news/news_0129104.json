He stayed in the game but was limping.\nFormer Chargers and Patriots standout safety Rodney Harrison, though, absolved the Dolphins defensive end of any ill intent, saying that he \"slipped\" during NBC's Football Night in America telecast.\nThe Dolphins entered the Titans game with one sack in the first four games, but piled up six sacks in Nashville, five of them in the second quarter, after the first Vernon hit.\nWhisenhunt's Titans haven't won a home game in more than a year and he dropped to 3-18 overall there.\nMeanwhile, the Dolphins, who had been on pace for a dismal four sacks after the season's first quarter, are now on pace for 22.\nSeveral reports indicated that Mariota will get an MRI on his knee Monday.\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739840&h=Titans+not+happy+with+Olivier+Vernon+hit+on+Marcus+Mariota", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739840", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739840&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:39:06.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
