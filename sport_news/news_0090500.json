CRUZ, LAGUNA, Philippines— After mingling and making friends with each other during the opening ceremonies, it's time for serious business for over 2,000 athletes and coaches all over the country as games in the 7th National Milo Little Olympics go full blast today in two areas here. \nAfter \"twerking like Miley\" during the pompous kick-off bash yesterday, Team Visayas athletes are all set to showcase their strength, stamina and will power with hopes of dominating all athletic disciplines featured in the most recognized and longest-running inter-school youth sports competition in the country. \nThough Team Visayas is composed mainly of neophytes and first-timers, delegation head Ricky Ballesteros is upbeat on their chances of clinching the overall crown as they have beaten seasoned teams and athletes during the regional level and event in the Palarong Pambansa. \nA total of 15 sporting events, two of which are demo sports in arnis and karatedo, will be contested in the three-day joust bankrolled by Nestle Philippines, where only one of the regional teams will be crowned as champions in each of the elementary and secondary divisions. \nThe events set to be take place in Sta. Cruz are the medal-rich athletics and swimming, badminton, basketball, football, gymnastics, sepak takraw, tennis and volleyball, while Pagsanjan will be hosting chess, scrabble, table tennis and taekwondo. \n“The National Finals is the culminating event of the Milo Little Olympics, where champions are made. It will surely be another thrilling sporting event for our student-athletes and spectators alike,” said Robbie de Vera, Milo Sports Executive. “The regional teams have been preparing hard for this and we will soon witness the fruits of their hard work. We would like to invite everyone to join us in Laguna as we watch school rivalries unfold and deserving athletes be recognized in the Milo Little Olympics National Finals.”   \nTeam Visayas was the first to complete a grandslam feat after topping the national tilt from 2009 to 2011. The Bisdaks, however, failed to snatch the perpepetual trophy after being dethroned by the National Capital Region, which gets stronger this time with the addition of athletes from South Luzon. \nLast year, Team Visayas reigned supreme in the elementary level, but missed the overall title to NCR after its secondary bets failed to collect enough points to top the secondary division. \nJust like in the first six editions, the points system will determine the overall champion. \nNow on its seventh year, the yearly youth sports competition emphasizes Milo's unwavering commitment in helping the country find the next generation of sports heroes by seeking to develop not only athleticism but also mental discipline in student-athletes. \nThrough the Little Olympics, Milo provides these young champions a chance to showcase their athletic abilities, determination and drive in the national stage as the first step towards achieving greatness in international leagues, including the SEA Games, the World Youth Cup, and the Asian Junior Track Meet. \nUnder its One Child, One Sport (OCOS) program in partnership with the Department of Education, Milo reinforces its commitment to grassroots sports development for youth through the Milo Little Olympics. Together with DepEd, MILO promotes an active and healthy lifestyle among aspiring young Filipino athletes.
