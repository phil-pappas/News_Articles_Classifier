Similarly, the telephone, radio and television have each in turn been seen as a source of doom.\nMobile devices like smartphones are just the latest example. Parents fear that they will make teenagers more socially alienated and disconnected—worries echoed and encouraged by many journalists and writers. Since all those earlier technologies turned out to be relatively harmless, why are we so afraid?\nMore From Alison Gopnik Is Our Identity in Intellect, Memory or Moral Character? Babies Make Predictions, Too Aggression in Children Makes Sense—Sometimes Cooking Has a Place in Human Evolution Smarter Every Year? Mystery of the Rising IQs One reason may be the inevitable lag between when a technology emerges and when we can assess its consequences. That’s especially true when we’re concerned about a new technology’s influence on the next generation. Meanwhile, anxiety and anecdotes proliferate. An old saw in statistics is that the plural of anecdote is not “data”—but it may well be “op-ed article.”\nIn a paper coming out in November in the journal Perspectives in Psychological Science, Madeleine George and Candice Odgers at Duke University review the scientific evidence we have so far about the effects of social media on adolescents. They found that teenagers are indeed pervasively immersed in the digital world. In one survey, teenagers sent an average of 60 texts a day, and 78% of them owned an Internet-connected mobile phone.\nBut the researchers also found little evidence to support parents’ fears. Their conclusion is that teenagers’ experience in the mobile world largely parallels rather than supplants their experience in the physical world. Teenagers mostly use mobile devices to communicate with friends they already know offline. They can have bad online experiences, but they are the same sort of bad experiences they have offline.\nTwo large-scale surveys done in 2007 and 2013 in the Netherlands and Bermuda, involving thousands of adolescents, found that teenagers who engaged in more online communication also reported more and better friendships, and smaller studies bear this out as well. There is no sign at all that friendships have changed or suffered as mobile use has risen.\nThe George-Odgers team cataloged parents’ biggest fears about mobile technology—that it might alienate children from parents, for example, or make them vulnerable to strangers—and found little evidence to support them. The researchers did find that screens seem to have a genuinely disruptive effect on sleep, whether caused by the effects of LED light or by social excitement. So it’s a good idea to keep your children (and yourself) from stowing the phone bedside.\nThe researchers also emphasize the inevitable limitations of existing studies, since these issues have arisen so recently. But the research we do have already is more reassuring than alarming.\nSo why, despite the research and all those failed previous prophecies of technological doom, are people so convinced that this time it’s different? One reason may be that the experience of technological and cultural change differs for adults and children. Psychologists call it “the cultural ratchet.” Each generation of children easily and automatically takes on all the technologies of the previous generations. But each generation also introduces technologies, and mastering them as an adult is much more difficult.\nThe latest click of the ratchet is so vivid that the regularities of history are hard to see. Inevitably, the year before you were born looks like Eden, and the year after your children were born looks like “Mad Max.”", "external_links": ["http://www.apa.org/pi/families/resources/newsletter/2014/12/digital-age.aspx", "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/in-1858-people-said-the-telegraph-was-too-fast-for-the-truth/375171/"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:13:19.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
