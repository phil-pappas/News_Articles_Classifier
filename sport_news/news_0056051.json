(Photo: Dale G. Young, Detroit News) \nAnn Arbor — Michigan State football coach Mark Dantonio likes to name things, specifically plays.\nThe most famous one was \"Little Giants,\" the fake field goal that led to a winning touchdown against Notre Dame in 2010. Other plays have been called things like \"Mouse Trap\" and \"Hey Diddle Diddle.\" And not just plays that work. One failed play was dubbed \"Frozen.\"\nSo, what's he going to name the fumbled punt runback that decided Saturday night's miraculous win over Michigan?\n\"We'll think of a good, catchy name,\" Dantonio said, smiling, Saturday night, following the 27-23 victory over Michigan.\nQuarterback Connor Cook suggested, \"Miracle in Ann Arbor.\"\nDantonio said he could do better — probably because he wants no mention of Ann Arbor in East Lansing.\nNow, what do the fans think?\nOn Sunday, The News asked UM and MSU fans across Twitter to chime in.\nDozens participated, with many making mention of Michigan's Australian punter, Blake O'Neill, who had a fantastic game until the last snap, which he fumbled and turned over to MSU.\n*APuntCalypse — twitter.com/fsimmons\n*MuffGate — twitter.com/eric Vansingel\n*G'Day State — twitter.com/jsluss123\n*Fail to the Kickers — twitter.com/laurabrevitz\n*Clusterpunt — twitter.com/umphd\n*RugBeat — twitter.com/ptguy2001\n*MSU R Welcome — twitter.com/WRHIV72\n*Over in a Snap — twitter.com/natscoach22\n*The Khaki Khatastrophy — twitter.com/matterck\n*Snap Judgment — twitter.com/TomLaurin72\nAnd, finally, our personal favorite and the winner of a cool MSU/UM prize:\n*The Blunder from Down Under — twitter.com/koppinru", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:48:32.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
