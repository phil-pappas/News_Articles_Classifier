A raucous announced crowd of 20,548 appeared ready to anoint Golovkin as boxing’s next big star, chanting his name at regular intervals, and then exploding after the referee Steve Willis stopped the bout at 1 minute 32 seconds of the eighth. “I was strong tonight,” Golovkin said. “My punches hurt him.” Golovkin knocked Lemieux down with a left hook to the ribs in the closing seconds of the fifth round. Lemieux rallied briefly, but Golovkin’s accurate punching throughout the fight earned him the victory. According to the statistics tracking website Compubox, Golovkin landed more than half of his punches, 280 out of 549 punches total. Golovkin cited his jab — which he landed 170 times out of 359 thrown, according to Compubox — as the key to his victory. “Every jab, I touched him,” Golovkin said.

Abel Sanchez, Golovkin’s trainer, said his fighter’s jab was the “best I’ve seen it in a fight.” “The jab was magnificent today, and he controlled the fight,” Sanchez said. Lemieux’s best moments came in the third and sixth rounds, but over all, he could not sustain the offensive momentum necessary to keep up with Golovkin. He lost every round on all three official scorecards at the time of the stoppage. “We prepared well for this fight, but I feel like I waited too long to take some shots tonight and that really hurt me,” Lemieux said. Before Saturday night’s bout, Golovkin had last fought at the Garden on July 26, 2014, when he knocked out Daniel Geale of Australia in the third round. In an interview with HBO’s Max Kellerman after the fight, which was broadcast over the Garden’s public address system, Golovkin memorably invoked a phrase that has defined his climb up the boxing ranks. “This is big drama show,” he said, smiling. Thanks to the excitement generated by the Geale fight and three subsequent knockout wins, the big drama show is now taking place before a wider audience. Compared with a crowd of 8,572 at the Geale fight, Golovkin’s bout against Lemieux was announced as a sellout. Golovkin (34-0, 31 knockouts) has now knocked out 21 consecutive opponents, 12 of them within three rounds. In the process, he has captured the World Boxing Association and International Boxing Organization championships, and now he has won the International Boxing Federation championship, which Lemieux held. Until Saturday, Golovkin had been unable to get a highly respected opponent to challenge him. But Lemieux (34-3, 31 knockouts) was widely thought to be a significant upgrade. Ranked the No. 4 middleweight contender by Ring magazine, Lemieux captured the I.B.F. title in June when he defeated Hassan N’Dam of Cameroon. “This is the biggest test for me,” Golovkin said before the fight. “He’s the I.B.F. champ. It’s a big situation, unification.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:16:10.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
