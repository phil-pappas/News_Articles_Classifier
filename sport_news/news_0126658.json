The New York Civil Liberties Union brought a similar claim in Brooklyn federal court in 2013. In addition, a group of civil rights lawyers filed papers in Manhattan federal court, claiming the surveillance runs afoul of a longstanding court order limiting how the police can monitor political activity.\nBoth of those disputes have been settled, according to court filings.", "external_links": ["https://www.muslimadvocates.org/"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:13:06.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
