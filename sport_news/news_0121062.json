Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow WOODSTOCK — Liam Byrne threw for 340 yards and three touchdowns as Woodstock led wire-to-to wire to beat Cherokee 37-22 on Friday and keep the Wolverines’ postseason aspirations alive.Much like last week, Woodstock (4-3, 2-3 Region 5 ) jumped out to an early lead when Byrne found Ethan Chamberlin for a 33-yard touchdown and Louis Hall for a 70-yard touchdown that put the Wolverines up 14-0 in the first quarter. A blocked punt by Jerrail McMickens then resulted in a safety and made the score 16-0 at the half.But unlike last week, when Lassiter rallied to beat Woodstock, the Wolverines staved off any attempt at a rally Cherokee (4-2, 2-2) could mount.“It was nice to get off to a fast start again, but it was even nicer to hold on this time,” Woodstock coach Brent Budde said. “We knew we had to win this one, and our guys stepped up and did that. The biggest difference this week was execution.”Another major difference this week was the play of Byrne, who looked much more comfortable in the offense. The junior was 24-of-33 and got even more involved than usual with a 2-yard touchdown run and a 14-yard reception off a pass from Hall.Chamberlin was Byrne’s most frequent target, hauling in seven passes for 100 yards and two scores, and Hall had a big game with 97 yards and a touchdown on five catches.As good as the Wolverines’ offense played it was their defense that kept the team comfortably in the lead. Woodstock held the county’s leading rusher, Brittain Brown, to a season-low 61 yards on 15 carries, and Da’shaun Tanner’s interception return for a touchdown put Woodstock up 30-0 with just over 9 minutes left in the game.“It was disappointing, because I felt like we played our best game of the season last week against Wheeler,” Cherokee coach Josh Shaw said. “They came out and executed much better than us. We weren’t as ready to play, and it showed. That’s our fault as coaches, and we need to get ready to get back out there next week.”Cherokee was able to move the ball at times, but it hurt itself with early mistakes. The Warriors fumbled the ball five times, which resulted in one turnover and minus-24 yards, including a loss of 12 on the their first play from scrimmage when the ball was snapped over quarterback Nolan Donley’s head.The Warriors’ offense did get going late in the fourth quarter when Donley found Brown, who took a screen pass 67 yards for a score, and Montrell Washington for a 12-yard touchdown. Washington also returned a kickoff 75 yards for a score in the fourth quarter, but it was too little, too late.“We’re still a young football team,” Shaw said. “We wanted to leave our guys in there late to get more reps. The more game time these guys can see, the better. We saw some good things late. It’s just frustrating that it took three-and-a-half quarters to get it going.”The win put Woodstock a half-game behind Cherokee for fourth place in the region standings. Both will have a chance to improve their standing next week when Cherokee hosts Milton and Woodstock visits Walton.“This was a huge win that we needed to have,” Budde said. “We let one get away last week, but we knew our guys had it in them. We knew, if we executed and played our best, we had a chance against anyone, and we did that this week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:02:14.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
