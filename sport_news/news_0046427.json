That, for the mathematically challenged, is 5.33 goals per game. If the B’s could keep that up all season, we’re talking 0-82-0.\n“We’ve got to be better defensively,” coach Claude Julien said. “The amount of goals, from the goaltender on out, defense, the forwards coming back, we’ve just got to be better. It used to be our strength and right now it’s our weakness.”\nRask was reminded that club president Cam Neely predicted the new-look B’s would get better as the season wears on.\n“I don’t think we’re going to get any worse,” Rask said.\nLest anyone think Rask was criticizing his teammates, be clear that he was shouldering most of the blame for this one.\n“I thought we played a good game,” he said. “It wasn’t 6-3 or whatever; I didn’t make the saves when we needed (them). I’m pretty concerned how many goals I’m letting in, that’s my concern.”\nIndeed, Rask ranked at the bottom of the NHL goaltending list, with a 4.72 goals-against average and .846 save percentage, after his third start. There was uncertainty all over the roster entering this season, but not in goal, where Rask seemed the one sure bet to give the B’s top-notch play. When a team is struggling, it needs its All-Star goaltender to bail it out from time to time with great saves. That hasn’t happened yet.\nRask failed to stop Brian Boyle’s 5-hole backhander on a breakaway at 4:50 of Period 2, which gave the Bolts a 3-2 lead. And then Rask allowed a bad goal to Jonathan Drouin from the left circle at 5:38 of the third, which made it 5-3 — and prompted the mock cheers.\n“I let in that bad goal in the third period,” Rask said. “It pretty much sealed the deal. It was my bad. You just have to make the good saves at the right times, and you can’t afford the mistakes. I made probably two good saves right at the beginning of the third (one a beauty on Ondrej Palat’s bomb from mid-slot) and that was it for the whole game. I had the chance to make a couple more and I didn’t. That’s just how it goes. I just have to get better than that.”\nStill, Rask is trying to remain positive and optimistic, expressing confidence that defensive problems in front of him will be fixed.\n“We are going in the right direction,” he said. “I thought we played pretty good. There were glimpses in the first two games where we’re playing some pretty good hockey — just not the whole 60 minutes. And then we get scored on and it seems to deflate us a little bit too much. Obviously, you don’t want to have a start like this. I think we’re going to bounce back and be all right. It just needs a lot of work.”\nThe Bruins actually have pulled back and played somewhat better team defense in each of the games so far, after an opener last week against the Winnipeg Jets in which forwards were flying up the ice even before the B’s had the puck. The players have been reminded by Julien and his staff that they have to be responsible on the defensive side, and it has gotten better and better.\n“Yeah, absolutely,” Rask said. “(Yesterday) especially. I think we showed (yesterday) that we played great at times. Even overall it wasn’t a bad game. Our power play (three goals) was great; the first period was great. I just need to make more saves and we’ll be fine.”\nWell, it may not be quite that simple. This club has more problems than just the goaltending. But a few more saves at the right time would certainly help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:32:25.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
