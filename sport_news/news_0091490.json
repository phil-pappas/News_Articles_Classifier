His 1,528 points were good enough for second place on the school’s list at the time, and he still ranks seventh in Pioneer history.\nGrowing up in Paterson as the youngest of 12 born to Italian immigrants, Cirangle attended college on the GI bill after serving in the Korean War. He’s lived in Wayne since 1967.\nCirangle’s fellow inductees into the Old Timers Hall of Fame are longtime William Paterson baseball coach Jeff Albies and Kennedy basketball coach Tommie Patterson.\nAlbies, a Hillsdale resident, coached two William Paterson NCAA Division III championship teams (1992, 1996), and finished his career ranked eighth all time in Division III victories with a record of 862-401-15 in his 33 seasons. Thirty-one of his players went on to play professionally, including former Yankee Dan Pasqua and former Oriole Bruce Dostal.\nPatterson, class of 1994, finished fourth in Pioneer scoring history, with 1,627 points. He holds the school single-game scoring record, with 47 points against Medgar Evers in 1991. He twice earned spots on the All-NJAC, All-ECAC and All-Metropolitan Basketball Writers Association first teams.\n* William Paterson’s current men’s basketball team is ranked 16th nationally in the 2015-16 DIII News Preseason Top 25 poll.

They open their season Nov. 14 against Mount Union in the first round of Drew University’s Rose City Classic.\nJ.P. Garcia, Bergen Catholic\n* Defensive back J.P. Garcia, a sophomore from Cedar Grove who played at Bergen Catholic, is a leader on Tufts’ defense. Tufts is off to its first 3-0 start since 2007 after beating Bowdoin, 43-24.
