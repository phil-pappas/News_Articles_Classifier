We are definitely capable of that.”\nA third straight victory for the Cubs on Tuesday, and the once woebegone franchise will advance to the NLCS for the first time in 12 years. The Cardinals, who led the majors by winning 100 games this season, have won at least one playoff series in each of the last four years.\nJason Hammel starts at home in Game 4. John Lackey, who won the opener, pitches for the Cardinals.\n“I want to win championships. I want to be on good teams,” Lackey said. “Got a chance here, still, and try to keep it moving.”\nJason Heyward and Stephen Piscotty homered for St. Louis, which got to Arrieta for four runs in his worst start in four months. But the Cardinals were unable to keep the Cubs in the ballpark.\nSt. Louis trailed 8-4 before Piscotty hit a two-run shot with two out in the ninth, a scary moment for a towel-waving crowd of 42,411 used to playoff heartache. Then Hector Rondon retired Matt Holliday on a harmless bouncer to second.\nMets win at home NEW YORK – Curtis Granderson drove in five runs, Yoenis Cespedes homered into the second deck and the New York Mets overcame Matt Harvey’s early struggles to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 13-7 for a 2-1 lead in their NLDS.\nTravis d’Arnaud also homered as the Mets set a franchise postseason record for runs in their first playoff game at Citi Field.\nMets rookie left-hander Steven Matz tries to close out the series Tuesday night, when the visiting Dodgers send 2014 NL most valuable player Clayton Kershaw to the mound on three days’ rest. Kershaw has lost five straight postseason starts.\n“Do you have to explain that one? He’s pretty good,” Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said of Kershaw before Game 3. “No matter if we’re down 2-1 or up 2-1, we feel like he’s the right guy.”\nHarvey fell behind 3-0 in the second inning before the Mets broke loose.\nDodgers second baseman Chase Utley, jeered by the crowd after breaking the leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada with a takeout slide in Game 2, was eligible to play while appealing his two-game suspension, but did not get in.\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:04:35.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
