Our guys are fully capable of that. \n“There's no doubt that Cecil (who tore a calf muscle in Game 2 and is done of the season) going down was a blow. We feel good with what we have right now. We've got a lot of relievers that are throwing really well right now.” \nGibbons also said that he doesn't plan to use David Price, no matter what the situation, given the workload he's already had this series. \nLike most of the team — not to mention the city and country — Gibbons is hoping the Jays bats perform more like they did in Games 3 and 4 in Texas than the first two here. \n“We felt terrible going down to Dallas, but the fact that we got it back here, we're feeling good, as we should. We're probably as confidence as we can be, so we've still got to go out and play it.” \nMORE PRE-GAME READING:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:49:57.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
