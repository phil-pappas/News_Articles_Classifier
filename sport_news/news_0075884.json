Natalie and Tim Rogers didn't worry much at first. Boys get bumps. But a prominent dermatologist decided to be safe and ordered a biopsy. \"Sit down. You're not going to believe this,\" she told Jaiden's parents when the results came back.\nJaiden had been diagnosed with stiff skin syndrome , an extremely rare and incurable disease. He was the 41st child in the world known to be stricken by it, they were told.\nSlowly, his own skin was entombing his body. The little lump spread to both legs and hips then migrated upward.\nTim Rogers wheels his son Jaiden to the family minivan for a trip to the doctor. Rogers built the property's yard to accommodate Jaiden's worsening disability. ( AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post ) As a 5-year-old, Jaiden had played soccer. Two years later, he was complaining about his stiffening legs. He couldn't bend his knees. They kept buckling under him, and he fell.\nHe took the loss in stride. \"Mommy,\" he announced calmly one day, \"I need a wheelchair. My legs won't walk anymore.\"\nFor the unlucky few, rare diseases come with a special curse. They don't get big research grants. Natalie and Tim know of one doctor, at Johns Hopkins Children's Center, who is studying stiff skin syndrome.\nAdvertisement Because the disease is so rare, its diagnosis and prognosis can be unclear. The Johns Hopkins doctor, Hal Dietz , said about a dozen families in the world have been confirmed to carry the gene for stiff skin syndrome, which sometimes gets confused with a deadlier, similar disease: scleroderma.\nIs there hope for Jaiden? His parents live each day with that belief.\nHe's 10 now. Three years after his diagnosis, he looks remarkably normal but for the wheelchair, a pale-faced boy at his bedroom computer in a plaid shirt and blue slacks.\n\"I like horses,\" he said.\nHe spends a lot of computer time admiring horses and wishing he could ride one. This Halloween he plans to dress as a horse. He also gets a kick out of YouTube's funniest horse videos, in which one rider after another gets thrown to the ground.\nIn many ways, Jaiden is a typical kid. A Star Wars stormtrooper helmet and a Denver Broncos cheerleaders' poster autographed by two of them ornament his bedroom. Lincoln Logs, Parcheesi and Candy Land games are stowed in his closet. He makes a variety of goofy faces. Soon, he will eclipse his parents' computer agility.\nJaiden says a dinner prayer with his parents, \"God is good, god is great and we thank him for this food. Amen.\" Jaiden is a 10-year-old boy with stiff skin syndrome, one of 41 kids in the world with the disease. ( AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post ) In other ways, he fights a daily battle with his body. He takes eight prescription medicines daily for ailments from leg pain to depression. Chemotherapy slowed the disease, but his parents stopped that recently because his fingers grew numb.\nThe only place he walks now is around the therapy pool his parents installed, because water takes the pressure off his legs. To keep them moving, a physical therapist helps bend and stretch them several times a week.\nJaiden also suffers occasional seizures and migraine headaches. He began gasping for breath at night, so he goes to bed now with oxygen tubes in his nose. And his stiff skin, which his father likens to the texture of a countertop, keeps spreading.\nHis parents have created a fundraising website for Jaiden . Now they are considering a month-longtrip to Europe, where experimental medicines are more readily available.\n\"It's kind of sounding like we're running out of options in the United States,\" Tim said. \"What we hope is it doesn't get in the joints. It gets hard as stone.\"\nFor Jaiden, physical pain is not the worst part of his disease. \"I can't play with my friends,\" he said.\nThere's something else he wants people to know about his illness.\n\"It's not contagious.\"\nDoctor's visit\nJaiden closes his eyes as Dr. Mikaila Pence, who has been learning on the job as she had never seen a case like his before, feels for spots of stiffness around his neck. Jaiden is a 10-year-old boy with stiff skin syndrome, one of 41 kids in the world with the disease. ( AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post ) The first time Dr. Mikaila Pence saw Jaiden, she got a big surprise.\nStiff skin syndrome? \"I hadn't ever heard of it,\" she said.\nPence, a cheerful young pediatrician, works in an office colorfully decorated with murals of fish swimming in coral reefs. Most days, her schedule mixes well-baby checkups with cases of runny noses, asthma and other common childhood ailments.\nThis day, her most unusual patient is visiting the fishbowl.\n\"I saw you at the football game on Saturday,\" she told Jaiden as his mother wheeled him in.\nAlamosa is an isolated city with a small college, Adams State University, and few medical specialists. Jaiden travels 240 miles to Denver to see a dermatologist. Meanwhile, his pediatrician does what she can to help.\nShe asks his mother about all of his medicines and the decision to drop his chemotherapy drug. \"I'll be anxious to see what the dermatologist says,\" she commented. Later, his dermatologist will prescribe another chemotherapy drug.\nPence examines his new areas of skin disease — a shoulder, his lower back. \"Tight. Tight and hard,\" she said, glancing anxiously at his mother. The stiff skin is forming bands on his body.\n\"Is he getting up and about at all?\" Pence asked.\n\"No. Huh-uh,\" Natalie replied.\nThat worries his doctor. At the age of 10, Jaiden is vulnerable to deteriorating foot bones if he doesn't strengthen them by walking.\n\"I think the hard part is it's such a rare disease,\" she said. \"It's hard to know what to predict or expect or how to treat it.\"\nAt Johns Hopkins, Dietz said stiff skin syndrome also is difficult to diagnose and confirmable only by a DNA test for the gene that causes it. Dietz said stiff skin syndrome often gets confused with scleroderma, which also produces tight, hard skin but can kill the victim by invading internal organs.\nIn some ways, Jaiden's disease looks more like scleroderma because, Dietz said, stiff skin syndrome tends to show up at birth.\nDietz rues that federal research dollars have been declining for such diseases. He said cholesterol medicine users, for instance, can thank a breakthrough originating with rare disease research.\n\"I see a worrisome trend in that rare disorders are not getting the same amount of funding,\" he said. \"I think rare disorders have taken a hit over the last decade or so.\"\nTroubled background\nLegally, Tim and Natalie Rogers are Jaiden's guardians, not his parents, but they call him their son, and he calls them Mom and Dad.\nThey would like to adopt him. They adopted and raised two other children. But Jaiden would lose Medicaid benefits if they did, and Tim's medical insurance as a retired Federal Bureau of Prisons employee wouldn't come close to paying the bills.\nThis month alone, Jaiden is scheduled to see eight doctors on a single trip to Denver.\nHe came into their lives at the age of 2 in what was supposed to be a short-term situation.\nHis grandmother in Georgia, an old friend of Natalie and Tim, called for help. Jaiden had been neglected, his 18-year-old mother was in jail, and his grandmother didn't think she could take care of him.\nJaiden had been born with fetal alcohol syndrome. He was hyperactive and mildly autistic but otherwise a pretty normal kid for the next five years. He reads above grade level, his father said, and struggles only with math.\nTim hopes the disease can be stabilized enough to enable Jaiden to hold a homebound computer job as an adult.\nAlready, \"he types a lot faster than I do,\" Tim said. \"He types from about 6 inches above the keyboard. It's amazing how he does it.\"\nThe couple bought a small house north of Alamosa in 2006 as their future retirement home.\nThey envisioned a quiet, self-sufficient life here. At dawn, Blanca Peak towers over the eastern horizon. At night, stars blaze in a sky unlit by humans.\nFor Jaiden, they added a boardwalk from the front deck to the new therapy pool building, a donor-aided project that cost nearly as much as they previously paid for the house.\n\"Tim and I had the house even before we had Jaiden,\" Natalie said. \"It was going to be a simple life.\"\nOnce she was asked whether she would have taken custody of Jaiden if she knew all the travails lying ahead. She didn't hesitate.\n\"We were thankful from the beginning,\" she said. \"He's a good kid.\"\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1016/20151016__CDXXJAIDEN__1AO3965x~p1.jpg", "http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/medical-handicap-accessible-needs-for-jaiden-age-9/44818", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1016/20151016__CDXXJAIDEN_3AO_7621x~p1.jpg", "http://www.hopkinschildrens.org/harry-dietz-md.aspx", "https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/5025/stiff-skin-syndrome/resources/1", "https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10308/scleroderma/resources/1", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1016/20151016__CDXXJAIDEN__1AO3908x-001~p1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:05:28.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
