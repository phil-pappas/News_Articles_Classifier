Birdies on No. 4 and No. 9 were negated by bogeys on No. 1 and No. 7 for a par total on the back nine.\nAfter recording a total of 61 putts in the first two rounds, Na had only 23 putts Saturday, but hit only four of 14 fairways and 12 of 18 greens in regulation.\nFirm greens made for truer putting surfaces Saturday, Na said.\n\"I think they cut the water off, and they've done a good job,\" he said. \"The greens are drying out.\"\nNa's performance came a week after he finished second at the Frys.com Open in Napa, Calif. Tied through 73 holes, he fell short of his first PGA Tour win in four years, losing to Emiliano Grillo on the second playoff hole.\nNa hopes his fate will be different today, when he tries to win for the second time on his home course. He shot 23-under 261 to win the Shriners Open in 2011.\nBut with TPC Summerlin playing \"as difficult as (he's) ever seen it,\" Na said patience is key. He said he thinks he will need to shoot 6 or 7 under for a chance to win.\n\"At the beginning of the week I told myself just stay patient,\" he said. \"The putter's fine. I just got to hit the ball a little better than I did today.\"\nContact Chris Kudialis at ckudialis@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4593. Find him on Twitter: @kudialisrj .\nFowler in need of Sunday...
