McLellan employed similar strategies in San Jose and went 7-0-1, 8-0-1 and 4-0-1 to start the last four seasons. Now, those were the Sharks and these are the Oilers, but, still, the players can understand why it worked.\n“Right off the bat he’s given us a chance to get familiar with who you’re going to play with and how he’s going to run practice,” said Jordan Eberle prior to Tuesday's game. “A lot of times in camp you have a lot of numbers so it’s tough to do that, you’re throwing young guys out with veteran guys to give them experience. Todd hasn’t done that at all. His mindset from that start of training camp was to get the guys who are going to be here ready for Game 1.”\nThere are are only 13 healthy forwards in camp right now and Taylor Hall, for one, is glad to see it down to a very workable number.\n“You get down to your real team in practice, you have game-situation practices with power play and stuff like that, it makes it a lot easier,” he said, adding being able to practice and play together as lines from Day 1 is something they all prefer over the musical chairs formations in previous camps.\n“I’ve always kind of wanted that through training camps before. It’s fun, not only for Connor (McDavid) and myself, but for Nuge and Ebs and Benoit to get the chemistry back right away is important for our team.”\nPlaying in the NHL for the first time comes with enough uncertainty as it is. McDavid doesn’t need to deal with any more of it in camp. And he hasn’t had to. He’s been with Hall from the start.\n“Any time you get to play with someone every day you’re going to naturally grow chemistry,” said McDavid. “I feel like we’re just getting better and better as we go here.”\nBy the time Matt Hendricks Lauri Korpikoski and Mark Letestu — three guys who wouldn’t have been able to pick each other out of a police lineup a month ago — hit the ice for opening night they will feel like they’ve played together for years.\n“I think it’s been a big plus,” said Hendricks. “They are two guys I’ve never played with before, so to be able to have that time to gel and get to know each other a little bit as people makes a big difference.”\nWith a small, largely veteran group, McLellan has been able to amp up the teaching, too.\n“It seems like we’ve covered pretty much every facet of the game already and we still have nine days before our first regular season game,” said Hall. “I think everyone is really comfortable with the spot we’re in. It’s a tough schedule to start the year but I think it’s really going to test our mettle and that’s a good thing for a team like this.”\nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski\nrobert.tychkowski@sunmedia.ca\nOilers players like the way head coach Todd McLellan has quickly pared down camp roster\nBy Robert Tychkowski , Edmonton Sun First posted: Tuesday, September 29, 2015 08:06 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, September 29, 2015 11:11 PM EDT\nBy dividing his players into three tiers in the first week of training camp and trimming the roster to the very edge of NHL readiness with three exhibition games to go, head coach Todd McLellan is leaving little doubt about his pre-season doctrine.\nDon’t screw around.\nThere are new systems to be taught and learned, new philosophies to instil and new chemistry to be forged before the Oilers set out to prove that this season will be different than the nine before it.\nSo rather than wasting anyone’s time by prolonging decisions that have already been made, and trying to get his message across to a roster bloated with players who aren’t going to be here on Oct. 8, he’s been quick to cut away the fat and tend to the meat.\n“I believe training camp is more than casually skating around on lines and playing games and trying to pick the team, it’s time to prepare your team for the season,” said McLellan, who has a lot of re-programming to do here after five coaches in\nAbout the author Robert Tychkowski Other Stories Edmonton Oilers' Eberle 'frustrated' by shoulder injury\nWhat started out as a beautiful sunny day in Edmonton dropped to Minus 14 in an instant Wednesday when the Oilers learned they’ll be without Jordan Eberle to start the season.\n0\nOilers prospect defenceman Darnell Nurse going to Bakersfield Condors\nFor most of his life Darnell Nurse has been on the other side of the numbers game, one of the reasons coaches give when they explain to a bubble player why he just got cut.\n0\nSee more from Robert Tychkowski »\nTop ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-09-30T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:03:20.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
