According to Enyeama, he has served Nigeria for 13 years. And I still remember how he got into the national team,\" Onigbinde, who took Enyeama to the 2002 World Cup, told Completesportsnigeria.com. \n\"I think he is a victim of the way we run our football. You would recall that for over three years now, he has been involved in one problem or another. Both within and outside the country. \n\"Even recently when we played a game in Kaduna, he was the one who came out and condemned the ground, as if it was his responsibility to decide where a match should be played. \n\"And if a player does this all the time and there is no strict control, then of course he will continue to believe that he is right, and that was why I sent a message to Oliseh, praising him for his courage. \n\"Although at the same time letting him know that he should have handled the matter in a way that wouldn't have attracted so much noise. \n\"I think that was the only thing missing in the approach adopted by Oliseh, otherwise I commend him for the courage.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:11:18.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
