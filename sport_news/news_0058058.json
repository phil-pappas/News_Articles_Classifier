Ever since the sophomore from Daytona Beach, Fla., arrived on campus a year ago, he's carried his 5-foot-8 frame like he was 6-foot-4 and made of steel.\nCharles Nelson can play receiver, coaches have said. Charles Nelson can play special teams, coaches have said. He can do anything.\nCharles Nelson might be the only person in Eugene that doesn't refer to himself, fully, as \"Charles Nelson\" on every reference.\nIn a sense, over the last year, Charles Nelson has proven that whatever he's asked to do, he does well. On Saturday, he was asked to play defense for the first time in his college career. He was placed at safety against a team that was prepared to throw the ball more than the Ducks were preparing to run it. For those not up to date on the current state of Oregon's offense: That's a lot.\nSo it was weird, after Oregon's 45-38 loss to Washington State in double-overtime, to hear Nelson admit that he wasn't sure how this experiment was going to work.\n\"Going out there first I was skeptical about it,\" Nelson said. \"I didn't really know how I was going to play or the plays that I would make. As the game went on and on I felt more comfortable about it.\"\nIt wasn't exactly shocking to see Nelson on the defensive side of the ball. He practiced in the secondary during the spring and his positional-status was a major storyline heading into fall camp. But Nelson has played offense and special teams solely this season, which is why it at least turned the needle when he trotted out on top of the defense against the Cougars in place of Reggie Daniels.\nAnd for much of the game, Nelson made his coaches look brilliant. He led the Ducks with 12 tackles, including one so jarring Washington State receiver Dom Nelson was fortunate it was just his helmet that flew off. Nelson was in on almost every play, didn't have any glaring mistakes and brought a presence of pain up the middle that Oregon's secondary has dramatically lacked through the first half of the season. Oh, and he also started at receiver on offense, gunned on punts and returned a kickoff.\n\"He can do anything,\" opposite safety Tyree Robinson said. \"It's Charles Nelson.\"\nWhat Nelson couldn't do, though, was help the Ducks pull out of a spiral on Washington State's final drive of the game. With Oregon up a touchdown, the Cougars had two minutes and 70 yards to go to force overtime. A sack, incomplete pass and intentional grounding later and the Cougars faced third-and-21 for the game. Luke Falk hit Williams for a 23-yard gain up the middle.\nThree plays later, Falk hit Gabe Marks for 22 yards on third-and-11. Four later, a 22-yard connection with River Cracraft on fourth-and-three. On the next play, Falk to Williams for an eight-yard touchdown forced overtime.\nAll the goodwill Pellum's defense had earned in the game, with the play of Nelson, a season-high seven sacks and 13 tackles for a loss was gone.\nThe Ducks let the Cougars carve through the defense twice in overtime and the game was over.\n\"We just need to finish,\" Pellum said. \"Everybody needed to dig down and find some energy to close it and that's what we're trying to get done.\n\"The only way I know is to continue to work hard.\"\nPellum, as he generally does in postgame interviews, mostly declined to go into specifics before seeing the tape. He did know that the Ducks were out of position on both of the third-and-long conversions. He didn't, however, know if he liked what he saw from Nelson.\n\"We're trying to find the best combination and we're still trying to find the best combination,\" he said. \"That was the option that became available so we put him on there and tried to get him going.\"\n\"We'll have to watch the tape,\" added head coach Mark Helfrich.\nFor what his opinion is worth, Nelson said his early hesitation disappeared. He doesn't know whether he'll be back at the position next week and frankly he doesn't really care. He wasn't the problem on a defense that gave up 641 yards of offense, but he doesn't know if he's the solution, either.\n\"I feel like I did well for the first time out there,\" he said. \"Like everybody else, there's a lot of things I could improve on.\"\n-- Tyson Alger\ntalger@oregonian.com\n@tysonalger", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:08:30.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
