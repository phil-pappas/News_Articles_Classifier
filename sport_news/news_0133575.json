Eastern Alamance coach John Kirby, who’s coach of the North Carolina team, was part of a news conference Monday in Charlotte during which teams for the Dec. 19 game in Spartanburg, S.C., were announced. This year’s game is the 79th version of the all-star game pitting seniors from each state against each other. Lamot, who verbally committed to Elon in August, is listed as an athlete on the Shrine Bowl roster. He’s in his second season as the Eagles’ starting quarterback and is the reigning Times-News All-Region Offensive Player of the Year. The only other player designated as an athlete is Southern Durham’s Jordon Brown, a North Carolina commit who has lined up at running back and receiver this season. The North Carolina team has two quarterbacks — East Lincoln’s Chazz Surratt, a North Carolina commit and reigning Player of the Year in this state, and Waxhaw Cuthbertson’s Austin Kendall, an Oklahoma commit. It figures Lamot would operate as the team’s third quarterback, in addition to lining up elsewhere. Gee is one of nine offensive linemen selected for the event. He has been committed to North Carolina State since the summer before his junior season and is a back-to-back Times-News All-Region selection. Seven programs had two players selected, which is the maximum for one school. Those schools are Charlotte Ardrey Kell, Shelby Crest, Durham Hillside, Charlotte Mallard Creek, New Bern, Greensboro Page and Fayetteville Sanford. The selections from Greensboro Page are receiver Diondre Overton and kicker Harrison Kiser. The Durham Hillside players are running back Abdul Adams and cornerback Najee Reams. Along the defensive line, the North Carolina team can boast Wake Forest’s Dexter Lawrence — a 6-foot-5, 330-pounder who is ranked in the top five of prospects across the country.
