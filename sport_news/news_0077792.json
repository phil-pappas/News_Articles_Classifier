We don’t look at ourselves as being young. \n“Up to this point, it’s been very difficult because every time we feel like we’re able to take a step forward, we’re taking a step back, and it’s hard to get any momentum. It’s hard to continue getting better when you’re playing like that.” \nMaranda and his coaches spent the postgame emphasizing to their team after the game to build off of what they did in the second half. New London (1-5) scored 22 points, some against Foran’s second string defense. \nKeep moving forward. Don’t look back. \n“I’m extremely happy with the way the guys played in the second half,” Maranda said. “All we need is a little bit of momentum. We just need those little things to keep going right. Move the chains offensively. Get some stops defensively, and things are going to start happening for us. \n“I thought in the second half our kids showed tremendous heart. We played with some excitement. The kids had fun.” \nMelquann Gomez completed 16 of 27 passes for 216 yards with a touchdown and an interception and ran for a 9-yard touchdown. \nD. Major Roman had four catches for 78 yards and a touchdown and had a 2-point conversion catch from Gomez. Jacob Commander added 12 carries for 70 yards and a score and kicked two extra points, and Efrain Santiago scored on a 4-yard run. \nForan’s passing game confounded the Whalers. First-year starter Lance DiNatale completed 13 of 19 passes for 242 yards with five touchdowns and an interception. \nBrett Huber caught seven passes for 163 yards and three touchdowns, ran for a 2-yard touchdown, and threw a 34-yard touchdown. \nThe game officially got away from New London in the second quarter. The Lions scored to start that period, then squibbed the ensuing kickoff. \nThe Whalers couldn’t field the ball and Foran’s Matthew Cruz recovered the ball at the New London 34. \nHuber threw his 34-yard touchdown pass to Colin Firmender on the next play to give the Lions a 19-0 lead. \nIt was the first of five touchdowns Foran scored that quarter. It scored twice on two plays and another on one play. \n“We gave them the short field (on that kickoff), and we couldn’t get the defense off the field,” Maranda said. “And offensively, we just couldn’t convert a first down and keep them off the field. That hurt.” \nn.griffen@theday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:18:22.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
