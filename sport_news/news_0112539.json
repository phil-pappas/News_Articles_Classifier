He high-pointed a ball and took advantage of several one-on-one opportunities that Pitt's defensive scheme grants. It was the breakout day Scott Shafer hinted was coming. Repeat performances over the next three weeks would be massive. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com LB Zaire Franklin \nSTOCK UP: Franklin admits he was \"terrified\" when he was flagged for targeting on a second-quarter sack (the call was overturned). He led the team with 11 tackles (three behind the line of scrimmage) and forced a fumble. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Head trainer Denny Kellington \nSTOCK UP: Kellington (left) sprinted onto the field and basically pulled quarterback Eric Dungey off it after he was knocked down early in the third quarter. Dungey wanted to go back in, but Kellington ordered him to sit on the bench and get evaluated. Head's up move. Photo by Frank Ordonez | The Post-Standard Late-game execution \nSTOCK DOWN: Syracuse has coughed up fourth-quarter leads each of the last two weeks, a reverse of what occurred in September, when the Orange made plays late to secure victories against Wake Forest and Central Michigan. Syracuse has been minus-five in turnovers in its four losses. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Play count \nSTOCK DOWN: Tim Lester can spend a lot of time on his phone during games these days. The offense is averaging 60.8 plays per game, worst among major-conference schools (and basically tied for last with Army). Syracuse ran just 54 plays Saturday but averaged 6.5 yards per play. The culprit? The defense can't get off the field when it counts. Look no further than the 19-play killer that chewed up the final 9:20. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Special teams gaffes \nSTOCK DOWN: Daivon Ellison had himself a day on special teams, but two mistakes stick out here. Syracuse gave back a bit of momentum before halftime when it allowed a decent return and committed an unnecessary penalty to set up a late field goal. And in the fourth quarter, Pitt converted a fourth down on a fake punt, a play that proved to be pretty important later. Stephen D.
