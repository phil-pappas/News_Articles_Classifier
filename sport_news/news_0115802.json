Oppenheim has qualified for the PGA Tour, finishing just high enough in the earnings at the Web.com Playoffs to get the last tour card available. Posted: Monday, October 5, 2015 12:00 am \nJust over a month ago, Rob Oppenheim’s bubble burst. \nHe literally missed qualifying for the 2016 PGA Tour by one swing of the golf club. \nOne swing over 20-plus tournaments. \nThis weekend, Andover’s Oppenheim understands what it is like to be on the other side of that equation. \nClosing the four-tournament Web.com Playoffs with back-to-back 67s at the Tour Championship, this weekend, Oppenheim climbed all the way up to a tie for 13th this weekend and amassed just enough winnings. \nHis four-week total of $32,606 qualified Oppenheim, who turns 36 in January, for the last PGA Tour card available. He did it by $105.00. \nOppenheim, who with his wife Lacey is expecting their second child in over the holidays, has achieved the PGA dream, after playing for six years on the Web.com Tour. \nAs every other step he’s taken as a pro has seemingly been, Oppenheim will do it the hard way. He’ll have limited tour status, meaning he’ll be at the mercy of the shuffle as to what events he’ll be allowed to play in. \nStill, it’s a huge breakthrough for Oppenheim, especially when things had seemed lost. \nOppenheim’s day and his plight were played out in high definition yesterday as The Golf Channel’s coverage zeroed in on the former Rollins College great. \nWhen Oppenheim walked to the 18th tee, the commentators talked of him needing a par to hold his position at 25. \nHowever by the time Oppenheim reached the 18th green – staring at a 30-foot potential birdie putt – he had been projected to finish at 28th on the money list. \nHe made a great run at the “must-have” birdie, just to watch it skim off the edge of the cup for a tap-in par. \nBut with plenty of players still out there on the course, Oppenheim was left with the waiting game, only to be rewarded late in the afternoon with the news.
