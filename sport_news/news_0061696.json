The Spartans’ senior quarterback, a potential first-round NFL draft pick, has a 28-3 career record, the most wins in school history. He’s thrown for 10 touchdowns this season and only one interception, averaging 195.4 yards per game.\nRutgers offense vs. Michigan State defense: With Leonte Carroo returning from his suspension, the Scarlet Knights have their No. 1 player back. The big question is whether the Scarlet Knights can protect Chris Laviano so he find Carroo downfield. Michigan State’s defense has been a little more spotty than the No. 4 Spartans would have liked. They’ve allowed 1,884 total yards, 11 less than their offense has produced. Rutgers must be mindful of Shilique Calhoun, a 6-foot-5, 250 pound defensive end from Middletown who leads Michigan State with 4 1/2 sacks and 5 1/2 tackles for losses.\nMichigan State offense vs. Rutgers defense: Cook isn’t the only Spartans playmaker. Freshman running back LJ Scott is coming off his best game, gaining 146 yards on 18 carries and scoring two TDs in a close win over Purdue. Aaron Burbridge is Cook’s top target, with 25 catches for 414 yards and four touchdowns. Michigan State overpowered Rutgers with its running game in last season’s mismatch, and Penn State’s success on the ground against RU last month means the Spartans’ game plan shouldn’t change much. Maybe Rutgers can catch the Spartans looking ahead to Michigan. Or maybe not.\nDid you know? The Rutgers program has nine wins in its history over a ranked opponent, including a 1988 win over No. 15 Michigan State.\nPrediction: Michigan State 28, Rutgers 17\n— John Rowe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:33.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
