He was my husband, and I still wish he was.\" \nFather, children by his bedside \nOdom's father and two children are with him at the hospital, the source said. \nOfficials haven't said what was wrong with Odom, and his condition remains unclear. \nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson, who visited him Wednesday, said the former basketball star was on life support and is not conscious. \nFour teams, 14 seasons \nOdom, 35, won two NBA championships as a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers. \nHe played for four teams during his 14 seasons in the NBA and won the Sixth Man of the Year Award during the 2010-11 season. \nThe Los Angeles Clippers drafted Odom in 1999, and he played for the team for four seasons before signing with the Miami Heat. \nAfter one season in Miami, he was traded to the Lakers, and became a key part of their championship teams in 2009 and 2010. \nA year later, he played briefly for the Dallas Mavericks before returning to the Clippers for one season. He has not played in the NBA since then, though the New York Knicks signed him during the offseason last year, only to cut him three months later. \nOutside of basketball, Odom has continued making headlines, including for a drunken driving charge two years ago.
