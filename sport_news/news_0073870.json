(AP) - College Board trustees will start interviewing candidates to become the next chancellor of the University of Mississippi next week.\nThe board's search committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday and Wednesday at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Board President Alan Perry of Jackson says trustees will conduct the first round of interviews, seeking a replacement for former Chancellor Dan Jones.\nPerry won't say how many candidates the board is interviewing, whether any are Ole Miss alumni, or whether any now lead other schools. Trustees typically seek to keep presidential searches secret.\nBoard members say they hope to name a new chancellor by year's end.\nTrustees declined to renew Jones' contract, citing concerns about contract management at the medical center. That decision prompted protests by students, faculty and alumni.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
