WHO does not currently recommend testing of viruses for routine monitoring because of a lack of standardised methods and difficulty interpreting results.”\nOf the 10 sailing events, Australia are genuine medal chances in six, which gives reason as to why Conde is treating the health of his team as paramount.\nAustralian Sailing performance director for the past six years, Conde said Rio represented the most challenging Olympics to prepare for, on many levels.\n“It’s massively challenging for us because we’re an equipment sport and we’re going to a continent that we don’t normally go too, so we’ve got massive logistical issues just to have boats there and to get there,’’ Conde said.\n“And (the health of our athletes) is clearly a priority area that we didn’t have at the last games (in London) and its not just about water quality and about getting sick.\n“It’s about detection for infection, detection for getting sick through food and safety.\n“At the simplest level, it comes down to hygiene.\n“We have sanitising wash, of which you would normally find in hospitals on our coach boats and everywhere when we walk into a building.\n“We’re improving our immunity and resistance to disease before we get there with supplements and probiotics.\n“We’ve got a set of protocols laminated and posted on our walls that say ‘if you get these symptoms than this is what you do.’\n“Its about awareness and we’ll work hard on personal responsibility to be educated and act on these things.’’\n Sailing team boss demands clear water", "external_links": ["http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://www.sundaytelegraph.com.au/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8d28d4df41b9bb9199d24a4a8df74c3e", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/more-sports/rio-2016-australian-sailing-team-boss-says-government-needs-to-be-pressured-to-clean-up-waterways/story-fni2frsp-1227572927535"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:27:56.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
