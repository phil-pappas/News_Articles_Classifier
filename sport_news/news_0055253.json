Lukefahr got some help from teammates to stop Schulze for no gain in Friday's Class 3A District 7 game at H.A. Lynn Stadium. Ballard downed Newton, 34-14. By Newton Daily News Sports Staff \nNewton High's Cardinals are still searching for a win this season. Lynnville-Sully came up empty at Class A No. 2 BGM while Colfax-Mingo, PCM and CMB chalked up big wins at home Friday in Week 6 of high school football action. \nBallard 34, Newton 14 \nBall security came into play Friday night for Newton High’s Cardinals against Ballard’s Bombers in Class 3A District 6 play. \n“We put the ball on the ground and you can’t win games doing that, but it happens in football games,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said following a 34-14 Cardinal loss. “Our kids were trying to stretch for addition yardage on those fumbles.” \nTwo of the four Cardinal fumbles led to Bomber touchdowns — one in the second quarter and one in the third quarter. Ballard scored to take a 7-0 lead, but Newton responded with a strong drive. \nJoseph Banfield carried the ball to the Bomber 12-yard line, but the ball was dislodged. Ballard recovered and went the other direction. The Cardinals had the Bombers in fourth-and-goal at the Newton 12, but Maxwell Stoltz found Tyler Ihle for the score. \n“The score just before half hurt us,” Ergenbright said. “Then, we gave up the big run to them to open the third quarter and they scored.” \nHunter Wright finished a two-play drive with a four-yard touchdown run for the Bombers. Another Newton fumble allowed the Bombers to go 55 yards quickly for Stoltz’s second running touchdown in the game. \nStoltz tacked on a 21-yard scoring run with 14 seconds left in the third quarter to push Ballard’s lead to 34-0. \nNewton got on the board with a defensive touchdown. Senior linebacker Duncan Lee scooped up a Bomber fumble and returned it for the score at the 8:58 mark of the fourth period. Newton finished the game with a solid offensive drive capped by a 5-yard touchdown run by Banfield. \nNewton falls to 0-6 overall and 0-4 in district play. The Cardinals travel to Pella Friday to play 3A top-ranked and defending state champion Pella in non-district play. \nNewton’s freshman came up a yard short against Ballard Friday night. Trailing 28-20, the Cardinals drove to the Bomber 1-yard line but time ran out. \nColfax-Mingo 14, Montezuma 9 \nCOLFAX — The Tigerhawks’ high-powered passing offense was slowed by the defending district champions Friday, but Colfax-Mingo proved it can win with its defense. \nJacob Lietz and Blake Summy both caught touchdown passes from Jared Myers, but the Tigerhawk defense had a huge goal-line stand and came up with two big turnovers in the second half to clinch a Class A District 7 win that could end up giving them a home playoff game for the first time since 2003. \n“Everyone knows us a big-play offense, but I wanted tonight to be the night that everyone knows we can play defense, too,” Colfax-Mingo coach Jeff Lietz said. “Everyone stepped up and made big plays all night.” \nMontezuma led 7-0 in the first quarter, but Lietz’s 51-yard touchdown reception from Myers tied the game early in the second period. \nMyers tossed his second touchdown pass of the game when he hooked up with Summy from 12 yards out. Summy caught the ball at the 5-yard line and made a nice individual move to slip passed a defender and then sprinted into the end zone. \nThat’s all the Tigerhawk offense would need. \nAfter Montezuma scored on its second possession of the game, the Tigerhawks forced the Braves into three consecutive three and outs. That allowed the home team to take the lead in the first half. \nNeither team’s offense scored in the second. Montezuma collected a safety following a big goal-line stand by the Tigerhawk defense. \n“For our team, who has struggled with the interior running game before, to get a goal-line stand like that was huge,” Lietz said. “We forced turnovers at the right time. I couldn’t be prouder of our defense.” \nBlake Summy came up with a big interception, and then he recovered a fumble that was forced by Lietz with less than 5 minutes to play in the game. \nColin Lourens also had three sacks for the Tigerhawk defense. \nIt was the fifth straight win for the Tigerhawks, who are now 5-1 overall and 4-0 in district play. Montezuma drops to 4-2 overall and 2-2 in district play. \n“One of our goals is a home playoff game and honestly if we take care of business against Iowa Valley and GMG, no matter what happens against BGM, we’ll get that home game,” Lietz said. “This is a pretty big step in the direction of accomplishing one of our goals in hosting a playoff game, which hasn’t been done here in a long time. It’s a huge win for our program and a huge win for our boys.” \nMyers finished with 300 passing yards in the win, while Lietz had 133 yards on six catches and Summy piled up 97 yards on six catches. \nCMB 32, Clarke 8 \nMAXWELL — Charles Robertson rushed for three short touchdowns and the Raiders piled up 419 yards of offense in the Class 2A District 7 homecoming win over Clarke during Friday. \nThe Raiders led 12-0 at halftime following a first-quarter touchdown run of nine yards and a second-quarter scoring run of five yards by Robertson. \nRobertson made it 18-0 with a 2-yard touchdown run in the third. Nate Bishop’s 3-yard touchdown pass to Brad Ritter and Marcus Mitchell’s 2-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter capped CMB’s scoring. \nClarke. which has now lost 24 straight games, scored its only points when Nathan Bair scored a 4-yard touchdown run with 1 minute to play in the game. \nBishop, the Baxter Homecoming King, finished 17-for-27 for 183 yards and a touchdown, while Hunter McWhirter was 7-of-11 for 81 yards. Robertson, the Collins-Maxwell Homecoming King, rushed for 57 yards on seven carries and McWhirter gained 42 yards on nine carries. Hunter Gunderson led the receivers with 81 yards on seven catches and Travis Lindemoan had five catches for 74 yards. \nJason Hillgren led the defense with six solo tackles and three tackles for loss. Ritter also had three solo tackles and a sack. Ben Gunderson finished with six solo tackles. \nCMB is now 5-1 on the year and 2-1 in district play. \nPCM 38, West Marshall 0 \nMONROE — The Mustangs recorded their fifth straight win and improved to 5-1 on the season following a non-district, homecoming triumph over Class 1A West Marshall. \nPCM, which is averaging nearly 43 points per game during its five-game win streak, led 21-0 after one quarter and 31-0 at halftime. \nLogan Gilman was 19-for-26 for 265 yards through the air and he tossed four touchdown passes in the win. He connected with Tyler Dredge and Luke Greiner for touchdown passes in the first quarter, hit Noah Clark on a 12-yarder in the second quarter and then hooked up with Greiner for a 76-yard strike in the third frame. \nGreiner finished with six catches for 116 yards and two scores, while Logan Littrell rushed for 47 yards, including a first quarter touchdown run of 20 yards. \nChase Wilkie made all of his extra points and booted a 34-yard field goal in the second quarter. \nThe Mustang defense had 10 sacks in the game, five of which came from Clayton Welch. Reid Jenkins had a team-high nine tackles, while Tyler Dredge had an interception and Austin Sneller recovered a fumble. \nBGM 44, Lynnville-Sully 0 \nBROOKLYN — Lynnville-Sully’s Hawks couldn’t get their running game going against Class A No. 2 ranked BGM Bears Friday night. The Hawks were without leading rusher Sage Ehresman, who is sidelined with an injury. \n“No excuses. We didn’t play the kind of football we needed to tonight to challenge BGM, which has a very good football team,” Hawk head coach Mike Parkinson said after the Hawks lost 44-0 at BGM in Class A District 7 action. \n“We couldn’t run the ball, but our passing game continues to develop. We just have to get healthy and come back and play Friday night at home,” Parkinson said. \nBGM (6-0, 4-0 district) owned a 23-0 halftime lead over Lynnville-Sully. Parkinson said the Hawks were doing some things well in the game. \n“We made a strong drive to their 5-yard line but stalled because we struggled to run the ball. We have to get back to playing more physical football,” Parkinson said. \nLynnville-Sully (3-3, 2-2 district) hosts GMG (1-5, 0-4) in district play Friday at Sully.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:09:32.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
