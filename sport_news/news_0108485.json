By Aaron Portzline The Columbus Dispatch • Wednesday October 21, 2015 9:41 AM \nThe Blue Jackets have fired Todd Richards this morning, replacing him with John Tortorella, one of the NHL’s firebrand coaches who has been out of work since Vancouver fired him a year ago. \nThe news was first reported by TSN’s Darren Dreger. A Blue Jackets spokesperson this morning declined to confirm the report. \nRichards was fired just hours after a 4-0 loss to the New York Islanders dropped Columbus to 0-7-0, matching the worst start to a season in modern NHL history. \n>> Blue Jackets chat with Aaron Portzline, 1 p.m. today, dispatch.com/cbjchat \nTortorella, 57, is expected to make his debut behind the Blue Jackets’ bench on Thursday when they play the Minnesota Wild in Xcel Energy Center. He did not immediately respond to messages left on his cellphone. \nThe Blue Jackets will send a third-round draft pick to Vancouver to compenstate the Canucks, per the NHL's collective bargaining agreement. \nTortorella led the Tampa Bay Lightning to the 2004 Stanley Cup and led the New York Rangers to the Eastern Conference finals in 2011-12. He is 444-371-115 as coach of Tampa Bay, the New York Rangers and Vancouver, but has gained a reputation beyond the wins as one of the league's most passionate, short-tempered coaches. \n>> Sign up for our free, daily newsletter on the Blue Jackets, get a chance to win tickets! \nDuring his only season in Vancouver (2013-14), he was suspended for 15 days (seven games) after leaving the Canucks' dressing room during an intermission to storm the Calgary Flames' dressing room in an attempt to get at Flames coach Bob Hartley. \nHe was fired after that season, with four years and $8 million dollars remaining on his contract. It's not immediate clear if the Blue Jackets assumed the remaining three years of his deal with Vancouver. \nWhile Tortorella runs hot, Richards leans on the other end of the spectrum. Blue Jackets players are likely in for a rude awakening. \nRichards was 127-112-21 behind the Blue Jackets’ bench after taking over for Scott Arniel midway through the 2011-12 season. \nHe led the Blue Jackets to the first two Stanley Cup playoff wins in franchise history (2014), and also compiled the most wins and highest winning percentage (.531) among full-time coaches. \nBut Richards’ teams got off to slow starts every season: 5-12-4 in 2013, 6-10-3 in 2013-14 and 6-15-2 in 2014-15. In each of the previous three season, the Blue Jackets had strong finishes: 19-5-3 in 2013, 25-12-3 in 2013-14 and 15-1-1 last season. He won't get a chance at another fast finish this time. \nRichards did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
