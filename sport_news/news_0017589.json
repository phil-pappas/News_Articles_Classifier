Tom De Bellis.\nThe younger Lodarski, whose first name was not released, is recuperating.\n\"He's still in the hospital with multiple fractures,\" De Bellis said.\nThe three-vehicle wreck began when the driver of a southbound Saturn sedan rear-ended a Yamaha Rhino all-terrain vehicle carrying the Lodarskis, said CHP Officer Josh Carter.\nThe impact shoved the Rhino into the oncoming lane, where the ATV was hit by a northbound Mazda 3 sedan, causing the Rhino to overturn, Carter said.\nThe Saturn's driver -- a man in his late 30s whose name was not available -- suffered no major injuries and was booked for investigation of vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence, Carter said.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-defaultpublicsafety.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-defaultpublicsafety.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:19:55.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
