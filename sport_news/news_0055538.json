The Aggies came out on top thanks to eight forced turnovers, seven of which came in the first half. The Aggies led 45-10 at halftime and never looked back. \nThe Aggie defense showed the world that it should be respected as one of the elite defenses in the nation after holding one of the best offenses to just 26 points. \nThe San Diego State Aztecs come in on a much quieter note. After a difficult nonconference slate that included losses to Cal and Penn State, the Aztecs have come out strong in conference play. With three straight wins, they are looking to live up to preseason predictions of them representing the West Division in the Mountain West championship game. \nWith undefeated conference records on the line, here are the stat categories to watch for on Friday night: \n\nThe Aztecs' offense isn't the most prolific, but it will get the job done. The Aztecs are led by quarterback Maxwell Smith and running back Donnel Pumphrey. Smith has had a solid season, throwing for 967 yards and seven touchdowns. Smith manages the game well and will always find his favorite playmaker. Pumphrey is the Aztecs' leading running back and leading receiver. Through seven games, Pumphrey has 729 yards rushing, 249 yards receiving and nine touchdowns. \nThe Aggie defense will focus all of its attention on Pumphrey. The Aggies will need to force Smith to make plays with his legs and to other receivers. The Aggies want everyone else besides Pumphrey to try to beat them. \n\nHow will the Aggies stop him? Expect the Aggies to put a spy on him. Whether it's Kyler Fackrell, Nick Vigil or another linebacker, the Aggies will need to sacrifice one of their defenders to just focusing on Pumphrey. \n\nHunt came into the season as the undisputed leader in the backfield. Mays, the junior college transfer, has proven he is more adept to leading the Aggie offense out of the backfield than Hunt. \nMays will take his 7.0 ypc to San Diego against an Aztec run defense that ranks 10th in the nation. The Aztecs are only surrendering 93.7 rushing ypg. They just held Tyler Ervin, a top-10 running back in the nation, to 22 yards on 17 carries. They are tough to run against. Expect the Aggies to rush for 100 plus with the two lead backs and quarterback Ken Myers coming out of the pocket. \nnovers this season \nThe Aztecs have lost nine turnovers so far this season, including six fumbles. If the Aztecs do get the ball to Pumphrey, the Aggies will need to swat the ball to force a fumble. Smith doesn't throw many interceptions, so the Aggies will need to force fumbles to win the turnover battle. \n\nBoth teams are undefeated and looking to take control of the conference. This could be a preview of the Mountain West Conference championship if things play out the way critics expect. The Aztecs and Aggies will have to put on their best games as this may decide who is the best team in the Mountain West.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:00:08.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
