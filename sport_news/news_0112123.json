Brown said Friday that Daniel Verley has cooperated fully with investigators. The charges will be dismissed in six months if he completes his service and stays out of trouble.\nVerley had gone to photograph a park sculpture on Sept. 3. The drone lost signal and ended up at the nearby Louis Armstrong Stadium. It plummeted into an unoccupied part of the stadium during the next-to-last game of a second-round match. No one was injured.\nThe prosecutor urged people to \"use common sense\" and operate drones away from crowded areas.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:08:12.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
