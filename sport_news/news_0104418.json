(AP) - John DalCorobbo won the Senior PGA Professional National Championship on Sunday to top the 35 qualifiers for the Senior PGA Championship. \nDalCorobbo, the 51-year-old PGA assistant professional at Brickyard Crossing in Indianpolis, closed with a 3-under 69 on the Bayonet Course for a one-stroke victory over PGA Tour winner Jim Carter. \n“When you are in your 40s, you try to do everything you can to keep yourself in shape and work on your golf swing before you turn 50,” DalCorobbo said. “Life throws you curves. You ask yourself, ‘Can I handle something that I’ve never done?’” \nCarter, from Scottsdale, Arizona, finished with a 70. \nThe Senior PGA Championship is in May at Harbor Shores in Benton Harbor, Michigan. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:07:11.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
