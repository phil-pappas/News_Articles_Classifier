His assurances have done little to quell alarm among Muslims across the region.\nThe violence is not of the intensity of two Palestinian uprisings in the late 1980s and early 2000s but it has prompted talk of a third “intifada”.\nOn Friday Israeli soldiers shot dead seven Palestinians in protests near the Gaza border and a knife-wielding Israeli wounded four Arabs in the southern Israeli town of Dimona.\nIn the northern town of Afula, an Israeli-Arab woman was shot and wounded by police who closed in on her as she held up a knife. Police said she had tried to stab a security guard.\nIn Jerusalem’s walled Old City, a Palestinian stabbed and wounded a 14-year-old Israeli, and near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank city of Hebron, a Palestinian stabbed an Israeli policeman before being shot dead.\nBoth Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have called for calm and Palestinian police continue to coordinate with Israeli security forces to try to restore order, but there are few signs of the violence dying down. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:17:42.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
