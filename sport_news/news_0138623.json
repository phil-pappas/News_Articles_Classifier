Clearly, Barnum is onto something.\nThe victory makes PSU 2-0 over FBS opposition. And, in what is a good sign for the rest of the season, the Vikings threw ball effectively. If they can stay balanced on offense, they can make some noise in the Big Sky Conference.\n-- Oregon is in trouble. The Ducks had a system-wide meltdown in the last half of the fourth quarter against Washington State and lost in double-overtime.\nThe Ducks still have half the season to play. But it's the tougher half. And now teams in the Pac-12, unhappy about getting rolled by Oregon in recent years, are seeing a chance for payback.\nWe need look no further than next week's game at Washington. Do you think the Huskies aren't salivating at the opportunity? It would help Oregon to have quarterback Vernon Adams return from injury, but the Ducks need more from their defense too.\n-- That Arizona could so convincingly shut down Oregon State's offense Saturday in Tucson isn't a good sign for the remainder of the season.\nThe Wildcats had been atrocious defensively in the previous two weeks, and were missing some key defensive players against Oregon State. It didn't seem to matter.\nI thought the game at Arizona was a chance for the Beavers to make a statement. And, in a way, I guess they did. Opposing defenses now have a body of work from Oregon State to use to game plan, and the Wildcats took full advantage.\n-- Ken Goe\nkgoe@oregonian.com\n503-221-8040 | @KenGoe", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KenGoe"], "published": "2015-10-12T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:26:56.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
