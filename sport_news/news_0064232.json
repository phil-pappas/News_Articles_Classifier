(AP) Rory McIlroy is starting a new season on one tour before he finishes another season on his other tour. \nMcIlroy highlights the field at Silverado for the Frys.com Open, which kicks off the PGA Tour season that ended just three weeks ago.

Tiger Woods also was supposed to play until he had a second back surgery. \nBut McIlroy's appearance is an example of how hectic a global golf schedule can be. \nMcIlroy will head over to Asia to wrap up the Race to Dubai on the European Tour. \nAnd in his view, his ''new'' season really began in August when he returned from an ankle injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:05:47.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
