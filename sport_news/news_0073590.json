Yarbrough's Woodberry Forest High School team bounced back from an Oct. 3 overtime loss to Avalon High School with a pair of lopsided victories. His future team, Stanford, has won five straight. He was recently selected to participate in the prestigious Army All American game. \nAnd to top it all off, Yarbrough received word on Sunday that he had been admitted to Stanford from Cardinal head coach David Shaw. \n\"I was so excited,\" Yarbrough said. \"Stanford has always been the goal for me so it was awesome to see the hard work both academically and athletically pay off.\" \nEarlier this month, Yarbrough was officially selected to participate in the U.S. Army All American game. Yarbrough is one of five Stanford commits currently scheduled to participate - K.J. Costello , David Long , Curtis Robinson and Simi Fehoko are the others. \n\"The Army game selection is an honor,\" Yarbrough said. \"There have been so many great players playing in it, I'm humbled by the fact I was even considered. I can't wait to get out there and compete with the best of the best.\" \nYarbrough has been committed to Stanford since May - he visited The Farm for a camp after his sophomore year of high school and last spring for Junior Day. The four-star offensive tackle will take a return trip to The Farm next month for the Big Game. He does not plan to visit any other program. \nHe's been in regular contact with his future position coach and Cardinal offensive coordinator, Mike Bloomgren, as well as his area recruiter, Lance Taylor. \n\"They just tell me to keep doing my thing and how excited they are to get me out there,\" Yarbrough said. \nIn the meantime, Yarbrough is keeping close tabs on his future team from afar. \n\"I've watched pretty much all the games either live or on replays,\" Yarbrough said. \"I think the OL is doing a great job and the run game is so explosive.\" \nNew Jersey wide receiver Donald Stewart and Indiana defensive lineman Jovan Swann are among the players Yarbrough is trying to convince to join him on The Farm. \nCurrently, Yarbrough and Woodberry Forest are 5-2. They've fared well against a challenging schedule, and Yarbrough, who's significantly stronger than he was a year ago, has helped lead the way. \n\"I think we're doing well,\" Yarbrough said. 'We really stepped up our schedule this year playing some of the best competition in the region and I'm so proud of my guys and how we haven't backed down to anybody. \n\"I feel like I'm a lot better in pass protection and I've gotten a lot stronger over the past year (his squat has gone up by 100 pounds), which has helped my overall game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:46:45.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
