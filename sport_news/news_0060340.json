On Saturday I ran the Back on My Feet \"Rugged and Raw\" tenK at Cedar Ridge Preserve, and not to make too big a deal of it, the trail is known for being very technical, hilly and challenging.\nThis was only my third trail run and I freely admit I'm lousy at it. The great Billy Rodgers once said that in order to win a race you have to go a little berserk, and Grapevine's Troy Pruett once advised me not to waste time thinking about where you're going to put your feet. Just run.\nSo I've noticed that these younger, stronger and faster guys do just that. They freewheel along the trail at scary speeds, and that's how they win. There's an art to it.\nBut my knees aren't so stable and I don't have the strength I once had. I didn't mind so much running up the hills, but I found myself walking the steep downhills and being careful about where to step. It's hard enough to put the brakes on running down a hill, but rocks and logs make it worse.\nI had the good fortune to meet up with Jay Norman, the popular ultra-runner from the North Texas Trail Runners. Jay has probably raced more miles than I've walked in my lifetime. Kelly \"K2\" Richards, former President of LGRAW and RRCA Director at Large, told me, \"Jay has always been kind, encouraging and tough. He's also volunteered many hours and been a longtime fundraiser for the less fortunate. I can't remember ever hearing him complain or say anything negative.\"\nJay and I ran together for the first section of the race and he put on a clinic on how to handle a difficult trail. I noticed that on the level straightaways he ran along at a pretty good clip, but he walked the hills or rough terrain. What surprised me was that his walking pace was the same as those running near him. I ran as hard as I could through that whole section, passing trees and rocks like they were standing still, and we were side by side the whole way.\nI learned that experienced trail runners seem to know intuitively the exact spot at which to stop running and begin walking and that their walk pace is very quick. I'm sure someone has written a book on \"top ten tips of how to run trails\" but I'm just learning as I go along. Thanks for the company Jay. You are a gift to our sport.\nPamela Toelle\nNext time you get an award at a race, you'll probably find yourself at the podium with Pam Toelle. She's only been running for five years, but Saturday was her 95 th race and her first trail run. Of course she won her AG in the 20K, and her fond memory of the race is that she got a hug with her award.\nI have just one thing in common with Pam. We both fell only once. And my wife and I had even more fun running with Pam's husband Brad, who was also doing his first trail run. Congrats to him. He had a ball and Pam thinks he's hooked.\nSome more memories...\nI asked Ruben Saguil, the race timer, if I could put my water bottle by his table. He said yes, and as I was setting it down he tested the starting horn about a foot from my ear...Saw Laura Euckert volunteering at the second aid station. She asked me how I was doing. I said okay, and she told me not to worry because the rest of the course was flat. I knew better....Great seeing Leana Sloan out there winning her AG in the tenK....After I fell going up a hill, some woman behind me pushed on my butt to help me up. Only on trails!\nAnd finally...\nMy award certificate has a Quote: from a Back on My Feet client: \"BOMF gave me a sense of belonging in a lonely place. It also motivated me to become more physically active, which really helps me mentally.\"\nSince 2011, BOMF has served over 600 individuals. Nearly 80% have moved their lives forward by securing a job, housing or by enrolling in school or training.\nWon't you join us at next year's race?\nSpareribs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:32:14.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
