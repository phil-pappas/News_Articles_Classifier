The Lions know this week won’t be as easy. \n\n\"We've been playing pretty well,” said Camp Hill Head Coach, Frank Gay. “We want to continue to play well. We talk each week about taking it one game at a time and it's week 5.\" \n\nThe Spartans on the other hand are sitting at 3-1. Week after week this team has been tested. Week after week they have shown what they can do. \n\n\"I think after the Steel-High game I think we're pretty much set for the rest of our games,” said Milton Hershey Wide Receiver, Tyeair Diggs. “We have a lot of speed and stuff like that so a lot of teams can't keep up with us.” \n\nThe last time these two teams met, Milton Hershey took the win 25-23. Both teams are coming into Friday’s game expecting another battle. \n\n\"I look at Camp Hill like any other team,” said Quermorllue. “I just feel like we're going to beat them just like any other team. “ \n\n\"I think we'll do really well,” said Camp Hill Wide Receiver, David Fetrow. “We haven't beat them for a while. But I think this year we have a good chance at beating them.” \n\nKick-off is set for 7pm at Siebert Park in Camp Hill.
