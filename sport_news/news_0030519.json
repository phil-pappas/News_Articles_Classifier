Willis is expected to return for October 27th’s scrimmage. According to Coach Calipari, it is nothing serious and he will be ready for the season. Derek sustained the injury in today’s practice. Heal up quickly, Derek. You’ve been great in practice the last couple weeks. \n— Kentucky Basketball (@KentuckyMBB) October 10, 2015 It’s nothing serious and Derek will be back in a couple weeks, but I’m disappointed for him because he had been doing so well. \n— John Calipari (@UKCoachCalipari) October 10, 2015 \nGet well soon, Derek!
