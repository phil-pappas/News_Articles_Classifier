They were booked without physical detention for violating aviation security law.\" \nAn official from Korea's immigration service confirmed the nine had been deported on Friday. \nPolice confirmed local media reports that said the Russians \"drank whiskey and vodka, and walked around shouting\" on the plane and that they refused to show their passports until a representative of the Russian consulate was present. \nYou Ji-hyun, spokeswoman for the Games, said: \"Among the nine not all were athletes but the exact number is unknown.\" \nThe Games, organised by the International Military Sports Council (CISM), have been held every four years since 1995. \nThis year's event, being held in the central city of Mungyeong from Oct. 2-11, is expected to draw some 7,000 competitors from 117 countries. \nThe Games feature many traditional big-event sports such as basketball, boxing, swimming and shooting, but also showcase unique events such as the 'naval pentathlon'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:06:18.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
