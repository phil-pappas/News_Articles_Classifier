He had until Wednesday to enroll at Memphis, which has four freshman guards on scholarship in Mitchell, Jeremiah Martin, Randall Broddie and Craig Randall.\n\"He's a good kid. As long as he's happy, I'm happy. That's my whole thing,\" Herron said. \"He's probably (got) a 38(-inch vertical). He can get up.\"\nWith Mitchell now in the fold at Memphis, 247Sports.com bumped the Tigers' 2015 recruiting class up three spots to No. 12 nationally. Coach Josh Pastner has declined comment on the addition of Mitchell.\nJohnson day-to-day with shoulder injury\nPastner said senior guard Kedren Johnson is day-to-day with shoulder soreness and that he probably won't know more on Johnson's status for the season until later this month.\nJohnson is facing potential season-ending shoulder surgery. But he could choose to put off the surgery and play this season if he can tolerate the pain.\nFor now, Johnson, who had been projected as the Tigers' starting point guard, isn't participating in full-contact drills. With him out, the Tigers are looking at three players to handle point guard duties in his absence â€” senior Ricky Tarrant, sophomore Markel Crawford and Martin.\nJohnson isn't the only injured Tiger. Junior guard/forward Jake McDowell has missed parts of practice with knee soreness and Pastner said junior guard Avery Woodson hyperextended his knee in drills Sunday.\n\"We're a little banged up here and there,\" Pastner said. \"Jake can practice in spurts because he's got some knee issues. Avery had a hyperextension of his knee, but nothing serious. He'll miss (practice) Monday and Tuesday.\"\nRebounders hosting luncheon Today\nThe Memphis Rebounders are hosting a coaches luncheon today at 11:30 a.m. at the Penny Hardaway Hall of Fame on the U of M campus. All of the players will attend the luncheon, Pastner said.\nFor information on the event, to sign up or to join the Rebounders, go to MemphisRebounders.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:25:54.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
