Everywhere I’ve gone, we’ve done it,” Casey explained this week. \nCasey said they started the process, but will wait until just before the start of the season “to get a true picture, to see what guys really can do and can’t do.” \nWhat do the cards say: “What’s your job? If you’re a passer, pass it, if you’re a screener, screen it. \n“Read your card,” Casey said. \nThe team gives each player three laminated cards — one for their agent, one to take home to give to their significant other or best friend and one to keep in the locker room. \nThat way, they can never say they lost it, or aren’t sure what their role is. \nBackup point guard Cory Joseph said Tuesday that while he might have a concern or two about the practice, overall he sees the benefits. \n“It’s a balance. You don’t want to limit guys, but at the same time guys need to know what their strengths are on the court so it’s not like a rec league,” Joseph said. \n“It creates some structure. Obviously during the year players can break out of their role a little bit and show that they’ve been working on their game and show the coach that they’ve been getting better.” \nIn that case, Casey said the cards can be amended during the season. \nBut in the meantime, “it’s significant because everybody wants to be more,” Casey said. \n“I think it’s very important that you put it in writing where there’s an understanding of their role. It may be different somewhere else, but for our team, those four things that are important.” \nROSS OUT \nDeMar DeRozan will return Wednesday after getting a rest on Monday against Minnesota, but Terrence Ross, who started in his place, didn’t make the trip to Ottawa. \nRoss turned his surgically repaired left ankle while going for a steal against the Wolves and limped off the floor. He seemed to be walking normally post-game, but the Raptors decided to play it safe. \nThe hope is the setback is just a minor one, as Ross had been playing much better defensively compared to last season, when the ankle bothered him for much of the season. \nHe had started slowly offensively (15 points in five games, 5-for-23 from the field), but was hitting the boards well, handing out more assists than he had in the past and had compiled three blocked shots and seven steals in his four appearances. \nRookie Norman Powell should benefit from the absence of Ross and Casey said Tuesday that he has liked what he has seen from the Kyle Lowry-Cory Joseph two point guard lineup as well. \n“I really did. Two gritty guys. The ball got moving the game became faster (when they paired up) and we might see that some this season,” Casey said after practice on Tuesday. \nIN THE FLOW \nWhat impressed Casey most about Lowry’s 40-point explosion Monday was the way he scored his points. \nUntil forcing a few three-pointers late in his night, Lowry was a model of efficiency, not forcing the issue or freezing his teammates out. \n“He got the 40 within the offence. It wasn’t like he was just dancing and jacking one-on-one,” Casey said. \n“If a guy just comes down shooting the ball when he gets it, one-on-one, iso, then that’s a different (situation). \n“The ball was finding him.” \nSECOND CHANCE \nThe circumstances aren’t great — Sam Mitchell is getting his second opportunity to be an NBA head coach because his close friend Flip Saunders is fighting cancer, but nevertheless, he is making the best of the situation and thrilled to get this unexpected chance. \n“There were things about it I missed, (like) being around the guys,” Mitchell said before Monday’s game. \n“When you’re doing media (work), you’re around, but you’re not around the players. It’s just different being around these young guys, the energy that you feed off, watching them grow. It’s fun to watch them grow, just to be around them and watch them get on the bus in the morning when we’re on a road trip and the things that they here. The hairstyles. You miss that kind of stuff.” \nSaunders brought Mitchell back to the league as an assistant last season. \nAs interim head coach Mitchell is relishing the challenge of teaching the NBA’s youngest group, a squad that is filled with enviable talent that needs to be honed. \n“It’s fun,” Mitchell said. \n“Larry Brown (who coached Mitchell with the Indiana Pacers before Mitchell joined the Timberwolves as a player and mentored Kevin Garnett 20 years ago) used to say all of the time that when you’re learning, guys are listening because they want to get to a certain level. The tough part is when they think they know it all. That’s when it’s hard to coach.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:26:48.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
