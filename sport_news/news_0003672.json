with Maine 1 / 13 Back to Gallery Schenectady\nSimplicity was the operative word for the Union College hockey team Friday night.\nWhen the Dutchmen kept it simple, specifically on the penalty kill, good things happened.\nWhen Union strayed from its basics, the team struggled, which helped lead to a 1-1 tie with Maine in the first game of a nonconference weekend set at Messa Rink.\nUnion (1-0-2) killed all six Maine power-play opportunities but failed to connect on its own five man-advantage situations, mustering just five shots on goal total on the power play.\n\"I thought the PK wanted to keep it simple but the power play needs to listen more,\" Bennett said. \"It's a little disheartening as a coaching staff. It's not what you say, it is what they are going to retain and what they are going to do. Tonight, they just didn't do it.\"\nMore Information\nUNION 1, MAINE 1\nMaine 0 0 1 0—1\nUnion 0 1 0 0—1\nFirst period— None. Penalties— Perez, Mai, (kneeing), 18:20.\nSecond period— 1. Union, B.

A— 1,758.\nFollowing last Saturday's thrilling 5-3 win over Boston University , Bennett thought his team strayed from what it does best.\n\"You've got to play simple hockey. Yes, it was an exciting game last week, I get it, but we've got to get over ourselves, that is not our style,\" Bennett said. \"We need to bear down, come back harder, our forwards, to help our defenseman. Tonight was not a good combination.\"\nBennett offered a harsh assessment of the power-play unit that too often looked for an extra pass rather than put the puck on net.\n\"We didn't want to chip it in, we were looking for the pretty goal,\" Bennett said. \"I'm not sure who we're trying to impress and we didn't impress anybody. It's as simple as that.\"\nBennett was pleased with the effort of Union's fourth line with center Eli Lichtenwald and wingers Tyler Hynes and freshman Brendan Taylor .\nThe trio combined for Union's only goal and brought plenty of energy to the ice.\n\"I think the BLT line worked extremely hard and they got rewarded tonight,\" Bennett said. \"It certainly isn't a lack of effort from those guys, they get rewarded for hard work.\"\nUnion took a 1-0 lead when Taylor returned to the ice following a tripping penalty and scored the first goal of his Dutchmen career at 4:27 of the second period.\nLichtenwald got the initial shot and after McGovern held firm on the left post, Taylor picked up the puck and scooted behind the Maine net to wrap the puck around the far post.\n\"The puck popped on to my stick and the goalie thought the puck was with him and I kind of wrapped it around the net,\" Taylor said. \"I thought he might be on the short side and I tried to bring it to the net as quick as I could.\"\nJunior Alex Sakellaropoulos had 32 saves for Union and was bidding for his second career shutout until Brian Morgan tied the game for Maine (0-0-3) at the 14:04 mark of the third period.\nThe tie was Union's second 1-1 tie in three games this season.\n\"There is no way we should be dropping games in our building,\" Lichtenwald said.\n\"It was a winnable game for us tonight but at the same time, we are lucky to walk away with the tie. Alex was great tonight. Everyone should be thanking him for the tie.\"\nSean Martin , a local freelance writer, is a frequent contributor to the Times Union .", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805071/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805061/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805064/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805069/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805065/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805062/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805069/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805065/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805068/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805071/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805067/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805070/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805063/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805064/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805068/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805067/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805059/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805062/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805059/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805066/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805061/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805063/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805070/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/53/8805066/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:22:52.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
