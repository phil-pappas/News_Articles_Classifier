The former Ron Artest won the 2010 NBA title with the Lakers during four seasons with the club. \nHe spent 29 games with the New York Knicks in 2013-14 before getting waived. World Peace played in China and Italy last season, his NBA career apparently over. \nWorld Peace trained at the Lakers' training complex last summer and earned praise from the franchise's front office for his work with Julius Randle. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:03:08.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
