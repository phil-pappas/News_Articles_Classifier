So, maybe throw the record books out the window.\nWe do know this: The Patriots have scored 189 points in their last four games (47.3 points per game) against Andrew Luck’s Colts. They also scored 59 points against the Colts in 2012, but they were helped by a punt return for a touchdown and two pick-sixes.\nSince the merger, the single-game points record is 62. The Pats, who have never scored 60 points in franchise history, actually had a missed field goal and two punts in that 2012 game, so they were close.\nThe Patriots have had 43 offensive possessions in those four games against Luck’s Colts, excluding kneel-downs to close the second and fourth quarters, so they’ve averaged 3.9 points per possession (not counting the punt and interception returns). The Pats would need 16 possessions to score 62 points at that rate, and that’s not happening. But if they get 11 possessions against the Colts, they’d need to average 5.7 points per possession to make a run at the single-game scoring record. That could include nine touchdowns and two punts or eight touchdowns and three field goals (65 points), barring a defensive or special teams touchdown.\nSo now you know.\nQ: Is Scott Chandler going to be more involved in the passing game? — @kylearchie9\nA: Eventually, yeah, I’d think so. Chandler was outstanding in the offseason and training camp, so there were lofty expectations for him. He has been effective in some combination patterns with Rob Gronkowski, but the Patriots would create more matchup problems if Chandler got more involved statistically. He ranks sixth on the Pats with six catches and 49 yards and he has one touchdown while ranking 14th with an average of 33 offensive snaps per game. Chandler should get it going at some point, though.\nAsk a question for Jeff’s mailbag next Friday by connecting with him on Twitter at @jeffphowe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:59:46.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
