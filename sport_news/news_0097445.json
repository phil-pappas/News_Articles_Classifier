On July 5, the bank let it slip by a further 0.10 pound.\nEgypt has sought to tame a once-thriving currency black market by imposing a cap on dollar-denominated bank deposits among other measures.\nIn January the central bank allowed banks to exchange currency at up to 0.10 pound above or below the official rate, with currency exchange bureaux allowed to trade at 0.15 pound above or below the official rate.\nForeign currency reserves, which stood at about $36 billion before the 2011 uprising, were $16.335 billion at the end of September despite billions of dollars in Gulf Arab aid since mid-2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:21:43.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
