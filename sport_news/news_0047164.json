While running clearly enables physical conditioning, it also mentally empowers individuals to overcome seemingly insurmountable life challenges.\nAt this year's final major run event, Mizuno will put the power of running on display by assembling Team Inspire NYC - a group of New York residents with inspirational stories of personal transformation. Team Inspire NYC will not only support each other leading up to and throughout the daunting 26.2-mile endeavor, but also will be a source of inspiration and support for countless runners and individuals participating in this experience.\n\"For all of us at Mizuno, running is so much more than miles logged or the shoes we put on runners feet. The greatest value of running is the effect it has on individual character and its ability to inspire and empower people to achieve incredible things,\" said Kim Hoey , Division Brand Marketing Director, Mizuno USA . \"The support system a team can offer is far more powerful than a single individual. Team Inspire NYC is our way of demonstrating the powerful role that support and inspiration play in achieving personal goals, whether it's completing a marathon, overcoming illness, or other forms of hardship.\"\nMembers of Team Inspire NYC were selected based on their incredible stories of transformation, where running served as the life-changing instrument in overcoming challenges in their lives. Mizuno hopes Team Inspire NYC can serve as a broader platform of inspiration for individuals facing their own personal challenges. Runners and race fans across the country can follow Team Inspire NYC at #Run2Inspire.\nFive inspiring individuals comprise Team Inspire NYC, hear their stories on Mizuno's YouTube page, www.youtube.com/MizunoBrand .\nCarley Houser\nAs a recovering alcoholic, Houser uses running to help her to stay sober. She successfully completed a 12-step program and has remained sober more than three years. As a therapeutic release, she now participates in \"Back on My Feet\" running events, an organization providing programs and support for the homeless. Houser will add another accomplishment to her list as this will be her first marathon.\nSusana Montesinos\nSusana Montesinos truly embodies everything Team Inspire NYC stands for: dedication, grit and inspiration. She is a member of the Runstreet Club and is running in honor of her late father whom she lost to cancer. Montesinos started her running journey three years ago, at a time when she was so de-conditioned and overweight she could barely walk, let alone run a marathon. She's now setting out to tackle the granddaddy of them all, the NYC Marathon.\nLeo Fernandez\nThis year's marathon will be Leo Fernandez's fifth. He's also competed in triathlons and a 70.3-mile half Ironman. After the Ironman, Leo decided that completing another race faster or longer was not enough for him. He needed a higher purpose – one that was less self-serving. He's since committed himself to helping others discover the empowering benefits of running for both physical and mental health. Leo is running the marathon for \"Team for Kids,\" a national organization that supports youth programs. He's also running for his close friend Doug Cobb , whom Leo inspired to begin his own running regimen.\nDoug Cobb\nDoug Cobb is one of Leo Fernandez's protégés, and he's training for this year's marathon fueled by Fernandez's inspiration and direction. His marathon quest started last December when Leo asked him to do the NYRR Ted Korbit 15K in Central Park. As a result of that event, Doug was inspired to tackle the NYC marathon. Doug and Leo have been training together, in different cities, since June, with a few long runs together in Central Park. Even though they are several hundred miles away, the two stay motivated to train for the marathon. For Doug, running is a way to escape the world and the stresses of his career. Doug is also running for \"Team for Kids.\"\nKovon Flowers\nKovon Flowers is dedicated to spreading the message and mission of a healthy brotherhood. He is the captain of the NYC chapter of Black Men Run, a running organization devoted to promoting the benefits of running among African American. Flowers was inspired to join the group as a means of getting his life back on track following a stroke. He has transformed from follower to leader and will captain 20 chapter members in the NYC Marathon, all of who have overcome a various personal challenges and/or medical ailments.\nWhile the team members support one another, Mizuno is supporting the team with marathon entry fees and a full array of Mizuno running shoes and apparel. Mizuno will also showcase each team member's unique story of inspiration in a series of profile videos and ongoing social media content.\nWhat began as the means of showcasing the superior \"built-in support system\" of Mizuno's new Wave Inspire 12 running shoe, has transformed into a platform to champion the emotional benefits of running and the incredible stories of support, inspiration and transformation that emerge at marathons around the country every year.\nRunners can find the new Wave Inspire 12 running shoe in two-color options per gender at running specialty and sporting goods retailers nationwide, as well as online at www.mizuno.com .
