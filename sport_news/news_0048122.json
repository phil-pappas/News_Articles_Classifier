Forfeiture clauses are not permitted in vacation agreements.\"\n• \"An agreement cannot contain a 'use it or lose it' provision during employment. Once vacation time has been earned, it must be paid out upon separation if it is unused and determinable at that time.\"\nAdvertisement Hocking published a memo to members but subsequently reported that Wingate clarified that the official guidance could differ from what had been released informally.\nThe uncertainty put Hocking and the Mountain States Employers Council in a difficult position.\n\"We want to make sure that they got the right information and they're making informed decisions and there's no wasted time or resources,\" he said.\nThe labor department is expected to issue a clarification Monday, spokeswoman Cher Haavind said.\nState officials, meanwhile, say there's no policy being contemplated that would prohibit \"use it or lose it\" vacation policies.\n\"Not once was there ever a discussion we were going to implement a policy that was going to overturn decades-old acceptable practices,\" said Alexandra Hall, acting director of the state labor department.\nWhere employers have to pay out earned vacation is when an employee leaves the firm, she said. That \"upon separation\" terminology was not clear in the materials presented at the law firm meeting, she said.\nThe draft policy was intended for internal processing in a division that primarily deals with cases in which a person no longer is employed at the firm, she said.\n\"This is one of the many documents we're dealing with creating in this new process,\" she said. \"We're building a car while we're driving it because claims don't stop coming in.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.msec.org/pages/home.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:07:29.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
