Dickey's fourth pitch of the game, Alex Rios connected an inning later and the Kansas City Royals routed the Toronto Blue Jays 14-2 Tuesday to move one win from a second straight World Series. \nKansas City moved ahead 3-1 in the best-of-seven AL Championship Series and can win the pennant Wednesday, when Edinson Volquez starts against Toronto's Marco Estrada in a Game 1 rematch. \nLorenzo Cain scored on a passed ball and Mike Moustakas had a sacrifice fly in an LCS-record four-run top of the first. \nKansas led 5-2 in the seventh before breaking away. \nBlue Jays infielder Cliff Pennington relieved in the ninth inning, becoming the first primarily position player to pitch in the postseason, STATS said. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
