This will be a whole new experience especially competing amongst the world’s top best golfers and I hope to play at my best.” \nAlso debuting at the CIMB Classic is Ben Leong, who earned his spot by winning the SapuraKencana National Qualifier in August. \nThe Malaysian trio will face-off against international stars that include 2013 FedExCup champion Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott, Sergio Garcia and Ernie Els. \n“We are proud that for the first time, the CIMB Classic will feature three Malaysian players,\" said Effendy Shahul Hamid, CEO, Group Asset Management and Investments of CIMB Group. \n\"The CIMB Classic brings to the table some of the highest standards of professional golf. I am delighted to see home-grown players rising up to the standards, as a result of a lot of hard work and determination in their game. We wish all the best to Arie, Ben and Danny who will be carrying the Malaysian flag and pride this week,\" he added. – Bernama, October 25, 2015. \nShare with others", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:34:19.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
