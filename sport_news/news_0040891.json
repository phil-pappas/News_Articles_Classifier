The game appeared headed for overtime a minute later until Texas punter Michael Dickson, a rugby player from Australia, fumbled a deep snap and scrambled to get off a 10-yard punt near his own end zone.\nOklahoma State (4-0, 1-0 Big 12) almost didn't get a chance at Grogan's game-winner when the Cowboys were penalized with 10 seconds left. But because they still had a time out, it did not force the 10-second runoff and Grogan calmly drilled the final kick.\nTexas (1-3, 0-1) scored two defensive touchdowns but still fell to one its worst starts in more than 50 years.\nAssociated Press\nFull coverage\nFive thoughts: Late-game mistake hurts Texas in 30-27 loss to Oklahoma State\nTexas quotable: 'We just can't finish right now'\nNot again!
