They rank second in total offense, are plus-3 in turnover margin and only Atlanta and Arizona have scored more than Cincinnati's 121 points.With Baltimore off to a weak start and Pittsburgh missing Ben Roethlisberger, the AFC North could be their domain.Just don't bring that up to coach Marvin Lewis.\"The players have done what they've been asked to do and that's all we can be,\" he said. \"They've been down these roads before, and four (wins) doesn't get you anything and they realize that.\"So we've just got to keep playing. The other people, I can't talk for. I don't understand what people expect us to be.\"For years, they were expected to be the Bungles. That changed when Lewis came aboard in 2003. They've made the playoffs four straight seasons, albeit exiting each time after one game.Seattle's track record is a whole lot better as the Seahawks (2-2) seek a third straight Super Bowl trip. They come off a tight win against Detroit aided by a botched officiating call at the end, and they have severe pass protection issues.\"There's a lot of ways for us here to get better obviously,\" said Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, whose team has rallied from an 0-2 start.\"And that's really what our theme is, to continue to strive to find those ways, adjust things, and fix things so that we can be more efficient and more consistent. It hasn't been like we like it, but we're pleased to be getting on track, and the way the defense is playing gives us a chance every week.\" \nPhoto: Tony TribbleFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates!
