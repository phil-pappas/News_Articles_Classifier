It provides a macabre look at the cost of the global trafficking of endangered and threatened animals.\nThe contents of the Colorado center operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Office of Law Enforcement include an array of animal parts, large and small, and the items made from them — skins, carved ivory, boots, even medicines.\nThe confiscated items come from law enforcement agencies around the country.\n\"You can think of us as customs for wildlife,\" said Coleen Schaefer, who supervises the repository.\nA multibillion-dollar industry, the black market in wildlife is the fourth most profitable in the world, after illegal trafficking in weapons, drugs and humans, Schaefer said.\nThe repository has a loan program for schools, museums and nonprofits that have a conservation message. It also sends items to research institutions.\n\"Our main purpose is to provide conservation education about the legal and illegal wildlife trade,\" Schaefer said.\nNearby is the National Eagle Repository, also a one-of-a-kind facility in the U.S. that stores dead bald and golden eagles and their parts and feathers. Alaska Natives and Native Americans in federally recognized tribes may use the feathers for religious purposes.\nUse of the center's feathers reduces pressure to take eagles from the wild, the Fish and Wildlife Service says.\n___\nAssociated Press photographers and photo editors on Twitter: http://apne.ws/150o6jo\nCopyright The Associated Press\ncomment (3)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://apne.ws/150o6jo"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:42:11.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
