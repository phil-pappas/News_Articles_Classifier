Both were underdogs in the Division Series, at least as far as home field advantage was concerned, but they advanced by finding ways to break serve against the Cardinals and Dodgers .\nChicago swept the season series between the two teams, 7–0, but there are obvious caveats about small sample sizes and lessons of history (see the 1988 Dodgers, who beat the Mets in the NLCS despite losing 10 of 11 during the regular season). The timing of their two series matters, too. Both the May 11–14 set at Wrigley Field and the June 30-July 2 set at Citi Field fell before the late-July arrivals of Michael Conforto and Yoenis Cespedes , and both David Wright and Travis d'Arnaud were shelved by injuries; three of the Mets' seven starts, meanwhile, were taken by Jonathon Niese and Bartolo Colon , who are currently working out of the bullpen. For that matter, the Cubs were without Kyle Schwarber and multiple members of their revamped bullpen. Anyone using that 7–0 record as a talking point as to what this series portends shouldn't be taken seriously.\nYour browser does not support iframes. Offense\nAs you might expect given a sabermetrically-inclined braintrust, the Cubs' offense does not revolve around a high batting average and a whole lot of balls in play. In fact, the team had the league's third-lowest batting average (.244, in a virtual tie with the Mets) and put the ball in play just 61.9% of the time, less often than any team in baseball history save for the 2010 Diamondbacks . Instead, they led the league in both walks (567) and strikeouts (1,518) and ranked fifth in homers (171), the combination of which led to the second-highest Three True Outcomes percentage in history (36.4%), not to mention the majors' highest rate of pitches per plate appearance (3.97). These are not your 2014 Royals , but if you can't find some measure of entertainment from the towering home runs of Kris Bryant , Anthony Rizzo , Schwarber and company—a group fresh off setting a record for a four-game postseason series with 10 home runs—consult your doctor.\nMLB Video Three Strikes: Blue Jays, Royals ready to rumble in ALCS; L.A. blame game by Tom Verducci", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jay_jaffe"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:03:43.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
