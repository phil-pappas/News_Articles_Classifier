(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) \nWASHINGTON — The Virginia agency responsible for licensing professional boxing matches says it will evaluate Saturday’s fight between Prichard Colon and Terrel Williams. \nColon, 23, suffered a critical head injury in his match at EagleBank Arena in Fairfax. He underwent emergency surgery to relieve pressure on his brain at Inova Fairfax Hospital. \nThe fight’s promoter, Lou DiBella, says Colon suffered a brain bleed as a result of the injury. \nVirginia’s Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation says it will review the fight to determine if any laws or regulations were violated. \n“They’re going to look at his conditioning, his medical history, how he was training, things he ate on that day, the amount of punches, how many blows were landed,” said personal trainer Fairfax Hackley, who is not connected with this weekend’s fight, but has experience training fighters. \nColon submitted certified results of a medical exam and passed a ringside physical prior to Saturday’s bout, according to the Virginia DPOR. A spokeswoman for the state agency says it saw no red flag warnings before licensing the fight. \nColon was knocked down twice in the ninth round. He walked out of the ring at the end of the fight, but became dizzy and nauseous in his dressing room. \nHe was undefeated in 16 fights prior to Saturday’s loss and injury. On Colon’s Facebook page, the family says the fighter is showing reflexes in his hands and feet despite being in a coma. \nThe family says there’ll be a public prayer service in their hometown of Orocovis, Puerto Rico. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP.
