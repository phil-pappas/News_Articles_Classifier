But while the new system is supposed to end games quickly, Toronto went the maximum five minutes and still had to go to a shootout, eventually losing the game 5-4. \nSome thoughts from the participants: \nWinger Daniel Winnik: “Nerve-wracking. Fans were on the edge of their seats. Nick Spaling and I were out there against their top guys, (Mark) Stone, (Kyle) Turris and (Erik) Karlsson. It’s scary when those guys have the puck and there’s open ice. You just try to match guys’ speed, like on the penalty kill, take their skill away. All you can do is close check.” \nCentre Peter Holland: “Wow, that was a lot of skating. I think I went up and back about three times and was pretty tired at the end of it. But it was a lot of fun, pretty cool for the fans.” \nDefenceman Dion Phaneuf: “It used to be it could go either way in the shootout and now it can go either way in 3-on-3. You have to be smart and hold the puck. You have to play the percentages and have a really good chance to shoot the puck. As soon as it misses or comes off the pads, it’s an odd-man rush the other way. I think it’s great for the fans, adds another element. Skill guys who are fast have lots of ice.” \nGoalie James Reimer: “I just kind of treat it like 3-on-3 shinny in the summer. You play that a ton and you just go out there and try to have some fun. You want to make big saves so your boys can go back the other way.” \nSHAWN NOT GONE LONG \nHead coach Mike Babcock, faced with a back-to-back situation followed by five days off, did not believe it would be wise to rush the ailing Shawn Matthias back in the lineup against the Sens. \nBabcock said Matthias had a shoulder issue coming off the Detroit game that he didn’t want to worsen. Michael Grabner took Matthias’s place in the lineup, his first game as a Leaf. With Roman Polak back in the lineup replacing Scott Harrington, only waiver pick up Frankie Corrado has yet to play for Toronto. \nLOOSE LEAFS \nThough glad to get a single point in the standings on Saturday, three games is still the longest the Leafs have gone without a win to start a season since 2009-10, when they blew up on the launch pad with eight straight losses (0-7-1) under Ron Wilson ... Phil Kessel scored his first goal for the 0-2 Penguins on Saturday night in Arizona. Long-time Toronto linemates Tyler Bozak and James van Riemsdyk hit the board before him ... Babcock likes using Winnik and Spaling together up front. They’ve flipped right wingers with Joffrey Lupul and P.A. Parenteau. “Nick and I have some chemistry from my short time in Pittsburgh,” said Winnik, who was traded there at the March deadline, coming back as a UFA, while Spaling was in the Kessel trade. “We just built off that, we talk on and off the ice. It’s just easy to read off a guy who plays a similar style to you.” ... Another Babcock move on Saturday that was followed with interest was Matt Hunwick partnered with Morgan Rielly on defence and Phaneuf with Jake Gardiner. The coach continues to believe that working with a veteran is the best way for each of Rielly and Gardiner to learn their trade, rather than playing together, where Gardiner often defers to Rielly ... Two assists Saturday marked Phaneuf’s first multi-point game since Dec. 9, 2014 against Calgary. He also led all Leafs with 24:22 of ice time.
