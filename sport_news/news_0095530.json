Doug Martin ran for 136 yards on 19 carries, but it was 5 yards he did not gain that may have swung the outcome.\nWith four minutes remaining, Martin broke off a 49-yard run up the right sideline and appeared set to score until cornerback Bashaud Breeland tracked him down, catching up to make the tackle at the 5.

Their four long scores in the first half were the most in at least 75 years, according to Stats.\n VIKINGS 28, LIONS 19 Teddy Bridgewater threw for a season-high 316 yards and two touchdowns, and Minnesota won at Detroit.\nAdrian Peterson rushed for 98 yards as the Vikings won an N.F.C. North game on the road for the first time in three years.\nThe Lions had an 11-point lead after Matthew Stafford threw touchdowns on their first two drives, but they blew it because they could not protect the quarterback.\nMinnesota had a season-high seven sacks, which also was a season worst for Detroit.\nRAMS 24, BROWNS 6 The rookie Todd Gurley rushed for 128 yards and his first two touchdowns, helping host St. Louis put away punchless Cleveland.\nSt. Louis had four sacks and recovered four fumbles.

West rivalry played there.\nIt was the first meeting of the Raiders and the Chargers since their owners announced plans to build a stadium in the Los Angeles area if they cannot obtain new stadiums in their home markets.\nComing off a bye, the Raiders looked quicker and more efficient. Cooper, the first-round draft pick out of Alabama, caught a short pass from Carr on an inside screen and raced through the defense to give Oakland a 30-3 lead just before halftime.\nFALCONS 10, TITANS 7 Matt Ryan threw for 251 yards and a touchdown pass, and Devonta Freeman ran for 116 yards as visiting Atlanta held off Tennessee.\nThe Falcons bounced back from their first loss by grinding out a road win and overcoming two interceptions.
