(Photo: Johanna Coyne) CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIt didn’t take very long for Mallory Korenwinder to find out how popular she was going to be on the women’s college swimming recruiting trail. \nThe Tulare Western senior, who is a three-time Times-Delta/Advance-Register all-Tulare County girls swimmer of the year, was allowed to start receiving email correspondence from interested college coaches on Sept. 1, 2014. \nIn 24 hours, her email account was inundated with introductory letters from across the country — Pac-12, Big Ten, SEC and Ivy League schools were amongst the vast collection of emails she received. \nAnd there were plenty of valid reasons for their interest. \nAccording to CollegeSwimming.com , Korenwinder is ranked as the No. 29 women’s swimming recruit in the state for the Class of 2016, and No. 203 in the nation. \nKorenwinder was a medalist in the girls’ 100-yard breaststroke at the inaugural CIF State Championships in May and she’s just a fraction of a second from qualifying for the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials. \nIt could be quite overwhelming trying to decipher through dozens of college choices, so Korenwinder pared her list down to four schools earlier this year — Arizona, Louisville, Nebraska and UCLA. \nKorenwinder made unofficial visits to Arizona and UCLA, and really liked both schools. \nBut one of the two Pac-12 schools kept pulling on her heartstrings a little harder than the other. \n“I just really loved Arizona. It really felt like home to me,” Korenwinder said. \n“It just seemed like the perfect fit for me. I wanted to go to a big NCAA program, and (Arizona) won the (women’s swimming) national title in 2008. They have a phenomenal breaststroke program. It’s definitely a place I wanted to be at for the next four years.” \nIn early July, Arizona had extended a women’s swimming scholarship offer to Korenwinder, and she gave the Wildcats a verbal commitment by the end of July. She’s set to sign her letter of intent to attend Arizona on Nov. 11. \n“I think it’s a great accomplishment for her. She’s been working so hard for this,” Tulare Western swim coach Dave Hodge said. “Along with her talent, her academics and her work ethic, she’s definitely going to be a benefit for Arizona, and (Arizona) is going to be a great benefit for her. \n“This take some stress off her shoulders. She doesn’t have to worry about what may or may not happen going into her senior season.” \nKorenwinder, who has plans to be a pre-medicine major, would like to pursue a career in pediatrics. The University of Arizona has deep ties to Diamond Children’s Medical Center in Tucson, one of the top children hospitals in the West. \nTulare County student-athletes landing scholarships to Pac-12 schools isn’t an everyday occurrence. \nShe’s just the second Tulare Western student to head to a Pac-12 athletic program over the past 20 years — Joe Herrera, a 2014 Tulare Western graduate, is currently on the UCLA men’s track and field team. \n“At this point, it hasn’t sunk in quite yet,” Korenwinder said. “I think it’s going to be a great experience to be a part of the Pac-12. You have all these great programs in the Pac-12, the swim meets are televised. It’s very exciting to be a part of that.” \nNo time to rest on her laurels, though. \nUnlike college football and basketball scholarships, the vast majority of college sports scholarships are not full rides where tuition, room and board, and books are paid for by the school. Korenwinder is looking to build on her 4.2 grade point average to land academic scholarships to help with the full cost of attending Arizona. \nShe got her first taste of what life would be like as a University of Arizona student during Labor Day weekend. She took her official visit to the Tucson campus, which included meeting other future Arizona student-athletes and watching the Arizona football team win their season opener. \n“Sometimes I wish I could go now,” Korenwinder said. “I’m getting anxious.” Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1RJmCOV TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:49:10.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
