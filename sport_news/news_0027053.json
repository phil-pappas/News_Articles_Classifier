Was not (my) day to win. I just need to adjust a little bit a few more things. But in general I have to be happy,” Nadal said. \n“I believe there is no doubt that the confidence is higher now than a couple of months ago.” \nThe Spaniard’s serve had only been broken once all week but Tsonga finally pierced his armour in the fifth game with a smoking backhand winner before he totted up a one-set lead. \nBut Tsonga was all at sea in the second set and with double-faults at critical moments, Nadal broke three times to ‘bagel’ the Frenchman 6-0 and level the match. \nTsonga regathered himself for a tight deciding set and he broke for 6-5 when Nadal fired into the net. \nServing for the match, Tsonga dived full-length for a forehand volley and then got up to parry the scrambling Nadal’s reply and bring up match point, which the Spaniard lost tamely. \n“I will play against a very good player. I know it’s going to be difficult. But it’s for me an opportunity to hold a new trophy anyway because I’m in final,” Tsonga said. \n“It’s one match. If I win it, I’m the champion this week. I’ll take that like an opportunity, so I will give everything.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:32:15.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
