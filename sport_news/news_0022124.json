Gabriel Melo has seen one of \"those kids\" at almost every United States Tennis Association tournament.\nThe Waldwick freshman was referring to players who are nearly overcome with pressure.\n\"For a lot of kids it's 'Win or else,' \" said Melo, 14, who has competed in USTA events for roughly three years. \"That's their only purpose for being there. It should be a fun thing, but for them, it's a nervous thing … something to be scared about.\"\nBut Melo does not see those players among his teammates on Modern Tennis Connect or in USTA Junior Team Tennis. Instead, the JTT offers a formidable level of tennis in a team atmosphere without all the pressure and expectations.\nMelo and MTC had earned a place in the JTT National Championships, originally scheduled to begin Thursday in Columbia, S.C. But the event was canceled because of severe flooding in the state. \nMelo is a member of MTC's under-14 team, which includes 11 North Jersey boys and girls who train at Brookside Racquet Club in Allendale and Franklin Lakes Racquet Club.\n\"Everyone was really excited about going,\" said Sophia Swanson, a 14-year-old freshman at Ridgewood. \"It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"\nMTC emerged from a field of 75 teams in the JTT's Northeast Section, winning regional and sectional tournaments along the way.\nThirty-two teams were scheduled to take part in the five-day national tournament.\nThe USTA created Junior Team Tennis six years ago to add fun to a youth sport that was becoming more and more about winning, according to MTC coach Jorge Aguirre – a former top Argentine junior player. Aguirre said the leagues also help players ease into the ultra-competitive tournament world.\n\"Kids start playing in tournaments as early as 8, and with the parents and pressure to win, it's a lot to handle,\" Aguirre said. \"Of course you're always trying to win, but you need to lose as well … and learn from losing.\"\n\"It can be crushing when you lose by yourself,\" Swanson said. \"But if you're with a team, everyone understands … They're like, 'It's OK.' It's very comforting, knowing you have that support system behind you.\"\nSince MTC was started last winter, Swanson and her teammates have leaned heavily on each other. Aguirre requires team members to train together at least three times a week, but most have gone beyond that, practicing five times for a total of 12 to 15 hours.\nEach of MTC's five teams, ranging from 8U to 18U, also plays matches every Saturday against other locals. MTC won a whopping 26 of 27 matches leading into the tournaments.\n\"We spend so much time together that it's like a family,\" Melo said. \"Everyone recognizes each other's strengths and weaknesses, and we're always trying to help each other.\"\nMelo says being on the team has helped his game immeasurably. Besides developing his on-court skills and putting them to the test in weekly competitions, he's developed leadership skills from being part of a team.\nSwanson's mother, Alina, noted that the level of competition in the JTT isn't as high as in USTA individual tournaments. But she said the former has been \"very healthy for my daughter.\"\n\"It's definitely less stressful,\" Alina Swanson said. \"The kids can relax and enjoy each other's company.\n\"It's helped her become a more confident player, and she can take that with her when she plays in the [solo] tournaments.\"\nAguirre feels the concept creates a different kind of player than one who only trains with a professional and then dives into the USTA tournament pool. As a result, Melo probably won't see any of his competitors melting down.\n\"We're just going to have a good time, meet new people and play our best,\" Melo said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:30:14.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
