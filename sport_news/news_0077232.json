Encroachments were removed around Parade Ground, Kanak Chowk, EC Road, Subhash Road, Survey Chowk, Tibetan Market, Indira Market, Ashley Hall, Gandhi Park, Clock Tower and Chakrata Road. Shopkeepers at Paltan Bazaar were warned against displaying their products on footpaths. The anti-encroachment team also impounded carts and removed encroachments from arterial roads. Although residents appreciated the efforts of the police, they said the district administration and the police should take action against habitual offenders. Suresh Kumar, a local resident, said the removal of such roadside encroachments was important but the authorities should act against bigger encroachments by prominent persons. He said in many cases, the land cleared of encroachment by the authorities was soon encroached upon by the same persons or others. “While action is taken against comparatively smaller encroachments, no action is taken against larger encroachments by influential persons and well-established businesses,” he added. SSP, Dehradun, Sadanand Datte said the drive would continue in the future to ensure smooth vehicular movement on arterial roads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:13:08.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
