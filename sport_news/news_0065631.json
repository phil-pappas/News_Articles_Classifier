It's not about that,” Fisher said. “It's what I think is best for our football team and what's best for him. It's not an indictment on him. It's not an indictment on y'all. It's not an indictment on anything. I think what's best.” \nFormer FSU quarterback Jameis Winston was only made available to media for postgame interviews after he was suspended for the Clemson game for yelling an obscene phrase in front of students in the school's student union. FSU's Jimbo Fisher calls Will Grier's suspension 'a tragedy' for Florida Gators \nFisher said Golson would be made available, but did not give a timetable. \nGolson has gradually progressed in Fisher’s offense, which has yet to commit a turnover in 2015. In his fifth game as a Seminole against Miami on Saturday, Golson completed 25 of 33 passes for 291 yards and a touchdown in the 29-24 win. \nHis completion to Bobo Wilson on 3rd and 8 with 9 minutes left in the fourth quarter extended a drive that resulted in the game-winning touchdown, a 23-yard run by Dalvin Cook. The drive also marked the first time the Seminoles have played from behind this season. \n“My interest has to go with what's best for the kids and the football team. That's what's best for them,” Fisher said. “That's why. And there may be a time (Golson) does, but not right now.” 145 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1LrmUZD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:05:25.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
