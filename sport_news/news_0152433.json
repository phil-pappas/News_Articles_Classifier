It will be the first bowl game in Tucson since 1999. \nThe addition of the Arizona Bowl brings the total to a record 41 bowl games this season, meaning nearly two-thirds of FBS teams will play in bowl games. \nThe NCAA certified three new bowls in May, in Arizona, Orlando and Austin, Texas. Austin bowl officials decided not to start their bowl this season. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
