Obviously, my job is to go out and put up zeros and go as long as I can, and regardless of what's happened, what's happened [Saturday], in the past, all that's been taken care of internally,\" Harvey said Sunday at Citi Field. \n\"And regarding moving forward, pitching a good game, pitching my game is all that's on my mind, and I think that's all that's on our team's mind.\" \nHarvey, who posted a 2.71 ERA over 1891/3 innings in the regular season, made two starts against the Dodgers this year, both in July. He allowed a combined five earned runs over 12 innings. \nAnderson has never faced the Mets. He posted a 3.69 ERA over a career-high 31 starts this season. The 27-year-old relies on a sinker and a slider and induced a higher percentage of ground balls (66.3) than any other starter this year. \nAnderson, previously of the Oakland Athletics, has postseason experience in the form of 61/3 innings against the Detroit Tigers. He threw six shutout innings of an AL division series game in 2012 and allowed a run in one-third of an inning in relief during a division series game in 2013. Matz starting Game 4 \nSteven Matz will start Game 4 for the Mets, manager Terry Collins said. The rookie lefthander, who posted a 2.27 ERA in six regular-season starts, has not pitched in a game since Sept. 24 because of back spasms. If the series is extended to five games, Game 1 starter Jacob deGrom would come back to start Game 5 for the Mets. The Dodgers have yet to announce starters beyond Game 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:55:43.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
