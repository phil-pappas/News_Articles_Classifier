If I'm not mistaken, he must have made about six or seven one-putts, and none of them were inside of 10 feet,\" added Lahiri, who is one of five Asia-born players on the 12-man International roster. \n\n\"When you play badly, you want to assume as much responsibility for it. I'm sure Thongchai feels the same way. It's one of those days,\" he said. \n\nA double winner on the European Tour this year, Lahiri has risen to 39th in the world and finished an impressive fifth in the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits in August. \n\nDespite the early setback, Lahiri said his team mates had the talent to claw back the deficit. \n\n\"It's a long ways to go. It's not an ideal start. You don't want to find yourself chasing, but now that we are in that position, we're going to chase it down,\" he added.
