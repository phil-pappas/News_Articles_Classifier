Redmond is widely considered one of the best defensive backs in the country and he currently projects as a first or second round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. Over the summer, ESPN’s Mel Kiper ranked Redmond the No. 1 senior cornerback in college football. \nI haven’t seen any confirmation from Mississippi State, but this is terrible news for the Bulldogs and for Redmond’s future earnings, if true. \nFor Kentucky, it’s not the worst thing, although we’d never celebrate an injury to anyone.

Big Cat Daddy October 22, 2015 at 11:16   \nBad news for MSU and the young man. Hope he makes a full recovery and make the League.

We’d never celebrate an injury to ANYONE. UKBlue1! October 22, 2015 at 11:33 am | Permalink \nDude…..you are right. I wouldn’t wish any physical harm on anyone……including our rival. Trollin October 22, 2015 at 11:37 am | Permalink \nyeah, never wish injury to anyone. Severe explosive diarrhea on the other hand… BtownUKFan October 22, 2015 at 11:26   \nI hate that for any of these kids. It is a long tough journey to get back to 100%, just ask Alex Poythress. Hopefully he can get back to playing well and be successful at the next level. You’d think after the number of these injuries some brilliant sports kinetic engineer could design some type of protective sleeve for the knee that doesn’t terribly inhibit manueverability. UKBlue1! October 22, 2015 at 11:31   \nMay he have a speedy recovery.
