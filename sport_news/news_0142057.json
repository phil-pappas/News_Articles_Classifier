He has the right to quit his job claiming he is unable to function effectively while under investigation for “false allegations.” He has the right to reject the pleadings of Rick Pitino, to stonewall investigators, to prolong the University of Louisville’s agonizing search for answers. \nHe has the right to look out for Andre McGee. \nOne of the reasons NCAA infractions cases tend to drag on is that the governing body of college athletics lacks subpoena power and the tongue-loosening threat of incarceration. When McGee resigned from the Missouri-Kansas City coaching staff on Friday, he escaped the NCAA’s circumscribed sphere of influence and, presumably, a lot of embarrassing questions. Andre McGee resigns from UMKC \nPerhaps he is prepared to be a pariah on the Louisville campus, to make his living selling cars or condominiums or as a bouncer at the Bunny Ranch. Perhaps McGee realizes he is ruined in college basketball, that nothing he can say can save U of L from NCAA sanctions and that there are may be some things he could say that would be self-incriminating. \nFacing the possibility of being prosecuted for human trafficking, for participation in a criminal syndicate and for any other charges that might arise from his alleged role in using Katina Powell's escort services to entertain recruits, players and parents, McGee is probably better off remaining mute. \n“The threat of possible civil or criminal legal proceedings can ... muzzle potential witnesses,” the NCAA explains in a treatise on why infractions cases can take a long time. “If talking to an NCAA investigator could subject a witness to the court system, that person is less likely to be forthcoming.” \nExamples are numerous, and the price can be high. \nUSC has never fully recovered from its Reggie Bush fiasco, an extra-benefits case that resulted in a four-year probation, a two-year postseason ban, the loss of 30 scholarships and the vacating of the 2005 BCS Championship. \nThat the USC sanctions were announced on June 10, 2010 – fully four and a half years after Bush won the Heisman Trophy he later returned – is explained in large part by Bush's limited cooperation. Though few infractions cases last that long, a key witness who refuses to come forward inevitably delays the process and extends the uncertainty. Sullivan | Pitino fights for exit on own terms \nSo as much as Louisville fans want closure, and as much as Pitino has tried to guilt McGee into coming clean, we might be looking at a long siege. \nAsked if prosecutors might be willing to offer McGee immunity in exchange for cooperation with the NCAA, a lawyer friend replied, “Prosecutors are hard to push around. If they want to indict someone, and think indicting the girls is silly, this guy (McGee) is the biggest fish, and no way will they immunize him. They don’t care about the NCAA, and although they may care about Louisville hoops, probably not enough to take such a dive. \n“So I think (McGee) may stay quiet until the criminal investigation blows over or he is indicted.” \nWhile we wait for him to say something of substance, here follow the week’s Top 10 sports quotes: \n10. Shaquille O’Neal, former NBA star, on Golden State’s Steph Curry: \"He's something that I haven't really seen. I really haven't seen a small guard dominate like he did. You know (Steve) Nash did it every now and then, but Steph Curry like took over the game. If you look at him, I saw him a couple weeks ago in New York and, no offense to him, but he looks like a little baby. He has no arm muscles, no chest muscles.\" (SMU Athletic Forum) \n9. Tiger Woods, professional golfer, on his constant career goal: \"It's important for me to have more than 18 majors when all is said and done. It took Jack (Nicklaus) his whole career to achieve it and mine is not done yet.” (Press conference) \n8. Rich Rodriguez, University of Arizona football coach, on college football travel demands: \"Don't go on your soapbox and talk about student-athlete welfare and then have these kids get back at 5 or 6 in the morning. ... It's silly, it really is.\" (Media availability) \n7. Bob Vander Weide, former Orlando Magic president, on Dwight Howard: “When Dwight told me he was an icon, guess what three names he used? Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela. ... Are you kidding me? We’ve been to the finals once, and you’re a great athlete, but you’re an icon like these three? I knew it was over. I knew there was no chance of keeping him.” (Orlando Sentinel) \n(Howard’s reply, via Twitter: “never said that its total bs jus to let u know.” ) \n6. Blake O’Neill, University of Michigan football punter, on how to move on from a game-changing disaster: “Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and go again. That’s the beauty of sport.” (Detroit Free Press) \n5. Jalen Watts-Jackson, Michigan State hero, on how to handle a game-changing touchdown: “It’s crazy that 10 seconds could take you from just being on the team or people acknowledging that you guys won the game to people tweeting you or text messaging you, ‘You’re a hero. You’re a legend.’\" (Press conference) \n4. Paul Rhoads, Iowa State football coach, on defending Baylor: \"To beat those guys, you'll have to score in the 50s. Say they drop a couple of balls and the quarterback misses a couple of throws ... you're still gonna have to score about 50 to beat 'em.\" (Big12sports.com) \n3. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers star, on Gregg Popovich’s selection to replace Mike Krzyzewski as USA Basketball’s head coach: “Team USA is in good hands with him. It was in good hands with Coach K. It’s almost like ‘The Godfather.’ We hand it off to Michael Corleone now.” (Associated Press) \n2. Doug Glanville, former major-league outfielder, on the post-season slugging of the Mets’ Daniel Murphy: “There is hot. There is radioactive. There is volcanic. There is nuclear. There is the sun’s core. There is Murphy.” (@dougglanville on Twitter.) \n1. Jalen Rose, former University of Michigan star, on college recruiting: \"I want to paint a picture. What you see at a bachelor or bachelorette party is what happens on a recruiting visit. ... Yes, there is drinking. Yes, there (are) members of the opposite sex that are present. Remember, they're trying to woo me to the campus. And as a 17-year-old kid, first off, if I'm not getting laid, I'm not coming. I'm not signing. I'm not coming.\" (Jalen and Jacoby podcast) 6 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1S1GJrM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:28:21.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
