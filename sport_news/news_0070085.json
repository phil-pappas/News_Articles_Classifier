But imagine being a 20-year-old dropped into a foreign country with a bunch of co-workers who were native speakers, and who were older and far more experienced than you.\nYou’d probably keep to yourself a bit, too.\n“In Finland, I’d try to be a little funny,” Teravainen said with a sheepish grin. “But in the English language, the same joke doesn’t work here. You have to figure it out with new jokes.”\nThe 19-year-old Teravainen who made a brief three-game cameo with the Blackhawks in the spring of 2014 was a painfully shy kid who barely spoke a lick of English. The 20-year-old Teravainen who opened camp with the Hawks last fall was an awkward and uncomfortable rookie, still adapting to life in the United States.\nBut the 21-year-old Teravainen who will open the 2015-16 season on the top line alongside Jonathan Toews and Marian Hossa is a loose, confident cut-up; a media and fan darling after his breakout performance (on the ice and in front of the cameras) during the Hawks’ championship run in the spring. It’s not Teravainen in full — not yet, not with so much potential still to realize. But it’s Teravainen in his element — a grown-up now, an English speaker now, a Stanley Cup champion now.\n“You can definitely see it, just in his body language out there in practice,” Hawks defenseman Duncan Keith said. “Some of the moves he tries are so much about confidence. He’s played in the league now, he’s played deep in the playoffs and he’s won a Stanley Cup already. So that gives him the confidence. He’s played in those pressure games. They’re not going to get any more pressure packed or more intense than the ones he’s already played in.”\nLast season was one long learning experience for Teravainen. He learned to deal with disappointment and channel his frustration after being twice demoted to Rockford, and scratched in Game 3 of the Western Conference final. He learned to adapt to the American lifestyle with the help of his fellow Finn and frequent shopping partner, Antti Raanta. And he learned to deftly handle the crush of reporters that comes with a Stanley Cup run with the help of his “hockey dad,” Kimmo Timonen.\nHaving two countrymen, two Finnish speakers, at his side made the postseason so much more manageable.\n“It helped me, of course,” said Teravainen, who had four goals and six assists in the postseason after posting just four goals and five assists during 34 regular-season games. “It’s always nice to have your countrymen here and speak in your own language. Last year, I was not that good with English. I think it’s getting better all the time, [but] sometimes you have to speak a little Finnish, too.”\nRaanta’s in New York now, and will be wearing Rangers colors at the Hawks’ season-opener on Wednesday. And Timonen retired. Teravainen’s the only Finn left. A year ago, that might have been terrifying. But no longer.\n“I’m getting more comfortable every day, every week,” he said. “I’ve been around a little bit. It’s getting easier, for sure.”\nTeravainen broke into the league as a right wing, but he’s a natural center, and Hawks coach Joel Quenneville wanted to start him at center this season. Instead, he’ll be at left wing. It’s the kind of versatility few players his age have, and it earned him the chance to play alongside Toews and Hossa in a spot that made Brandon Saad a star and helped Patrick Sharp put up the gaudiest numbers of his career.\nQuenneville is notorious for his itchy trigger finger when it comes to changing his lines. But he thinks Teravainen can hold his own offensively and defensively against the opponents’ top lines.\n“He’ll play there to start the season,” Quenneville said “Hopefully, all year.”\nTeravainen welcomes the opportunity, and the challenge. A year ago, maybe he would have been intimidated by skating with two Hall of Famers. Overwhelmed, even.\nBut not anymore.\n“He’s really matured from year to year, but probably made his biggest step this year,” Quenneville said. “He feels he belongs.”\nEmail: mlazerus@suntimes.com\nTwitter: @marklazerus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:02:58.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
