Screenshot, NFL via YouTube Most of the time, when our favorite television characters are written out of our favorite television programs, that's it. They're done, and we never see them anymore. On the rare occasions that they are reprised in some form, it's like found money.\nFor Texans fans, Hard Knocks made our hometown football team a de facto television cast, and when cornerback Charles James was written out of the 2015 season in the final episode, it felt like a Game of Thrones style character killing. Bill O'Brien might as well have been straddling James, jamming his thumbs into his eyeballs and screaming \"I KILLED HER CHILDREN….\"\nWell, Oberyn Martell has been resurrected, kids!\nIn a made-for-TV comeback that is more scintillating than Dylan McKay's return to Beverly Hills, 90210 , The Rock's return to WWE and every Days of our Lives character rising from the dead combined, Charles James is once again a Houston Texan!\nThe third-year cornerback and special teams demon was signed off of waivers Monday afternoon, taking the roster spot of safety Lonnie Ballentine, who was placed on injured reserve after a gruesome leg injury suffered during Sunday's 31-20 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. After being released by the Texans in literally the final cut of training camp, James had signed with the Baltimore Ravens' practice squad, was elevated to their 53-man roster and then was let go last Saturday.\nJames became a wildly popular figure during training camp in part because of his energetic, determined personality, in part because of his love of wild designs on his socks and, most important, in part because of some sparkling plays on special teams, an area where the 2015 Houston Texans can use every bit of help they can get. Special teams, both coverage and return teams, have been a lifeless liability for this team, and James can minimally give them some energy and a pacesetter in that area.\nSo if you're keeping track at home, among the Hard Knocks fringe guy brigade who were cut loose at the end of camp, the Texans have now re-signed Kourtnei Brown and Charles James.\nWe are an EZ Nwachukwu signing away from having all the wrongs righted.
