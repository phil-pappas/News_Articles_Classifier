Picture: Mark Cranitch \nBRISBANE is standing firm - it won’t be letting James Aish go for a second-round pick. \nAish has nominated Collingwood as his destination club of choice after informing the Lions that he wanted a trade, but Schwab says little – if any – progress has been made in talks with the Magpies with just three days remaining in the trade period. \nList boss Peter Schwab says it will take more than just a second-round pick to pry Aish from the Lions’ grasp, and says he’ll be let through to the pre-season draft if their conditions can’t be satisfied. \n“Really, it’s in Collingwood’s hands,” he said on Trade Radio on Monday. Brisbane list manager Peter Schwab. Picture: Michael Klein \n“They’re the club that he’s indicating he wants to go to, so Collingwood need to satisfy Brisbane before a deal can be done. We’ve had a lot of discussions but nothing really put on the table. \n“It wasn’t that we didn’t want to deal with Collingwood. What we don’t want to come out with is ‘James Aish for a second-round pick’. That won’t do it. He will go through (to the draft) if that is the case.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:44:04.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
