Kim says gaming is generally banned by Georgia’s constitution, except for state lottery-run games. \nRepresentatives for FanFuel and DraftKings didn’t immediately respond to emails requesting comment. \nKim told The Associated Press neither company responded by the Friday, Oct. 16 deadline given in his letter. He says lottery officials are considering their next step. \nSeveral states are examining the fantasy sports companies after it was revealed that employees often played on competing sites. Nevada regulators have ordered the sites out of that state unless they get a gambling license. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:37:03.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
