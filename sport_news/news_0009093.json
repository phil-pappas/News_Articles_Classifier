Arrieta maximized the Mets’ chances of sweeping.\nAs the Cubs come home down 0-2, it comes down to this:\nIf Arrieta is going to pitch like your garden-variety Kyle Hendricks, then the Cubs have to hope Hendricks can pitch like the vintage Arrieta.\nTBS analyst Ron Darling said he was shaking his head that the Cubs would walk Daniel Murphy intentionally to pitch to Yoenis Cespedes.\nKyle Hendricks on Game 3, facing Daniel Murphy Kyle Hendricks on Game 3, facing Daniel Murphy.\nKyle Hendricks on Game 3, facing Daniel Murphy.\nSee more videos Excuse me, Ron, but which of Murphy’s homers the last two days did you miss?\nThe problem wasn’t Maddon’s ordering Murphy walked intentionally. The problem was Arrieta’s not getting Cespedes.\nIn the postseason, Murphy has homered twice off Clayton Kershaw, and once off Zack Greinke and Arrieta. If it’s up to Murphy, nobody wins the Cy Young.\nI lobbied for Maddon to move Kris Bryant down in the order to fifth because he was 0-for-14 on the road this postseason, so of course Bryant singles in the first inning and doubles in the sixth to account for the Cubs’ only run.\nOdd but very baseball thing from Game 2: The bottom five spots in the Cubs and Mets batting orders went a combined 0-for-32.\nIt’s a stitch to hear Dusty Baker spend time on the TBS pregame show talking about great rookies when he’d never play any.\nI drew criticism for not criticizing Starlin Castro for not hustling out of the box on his double in Game 1, and I was as wrong as Castro. But for those of you thinking triple, I think the cutoff throw would’ve gone to third instead of home and nailed him by a lot.\nKyle Schwarber and Mets outfielder Michael Conforto were teammates on the 2013 USA Baseball National Collegiate team that pulled off a historic five-game sweep of Cuba.\nThe Mets see your plexiglass-enclosed Schwarber home-run ball and raise you a Big Apple home-prop with a bandage where Travis d’Arnaud’s home run ricocheted in Game 1.\nTBS should just admit that what it calls a pitch window is really just a heat map of Whack-A-Mole.\nThe Choice (and remember, death is not an option): Stupid NLCS talk of pizza vs. stupid NLCS talk of 1969?\nBut Jerry Seinfeld as the Mets' lounge act vs. Eddie Vedder as the Cubs’ house band -- now that’s an argument worth having.\n Major League Baseball Baseball Jake Arrieta Chicago Cubs Daniel Murphy New York Mets Kyle Hendricks", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5624778b/turbine/ct-kyle-hendricks-on-game-3-facing-daniel-murphy-20151018", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5624f0c4/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-arrieta-hendricks-rosenbloom-20151019", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56247662/turbine/ct-jake-arrieta-on-daniel-murphy-1st-inning-struggles-20151018"], "published": "2015-10-19T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:39:34.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
