The junior fullback/linebacker was backing up senior captain Jack Gardner at both positions until Gardner missed the Bridgewater and Watchung Hills games with a broken forearm. \n“We have the ‘Next Man Up’ mentality,” said Burton, who stepped in for Gardner and did a commendable job on both sides of the ball. “I was waiting for my chance and when the time came I just jumped on it. I was ready for it.” \nGardner returned to play defense in last week’s 42-6 victory over Franklin . \nBurton will be ready for whatever role he’s asked to do when the Stateliners (3-1) play at Hillsborough (1-3) on Friday night in a Mid-State 38 Conference Delaware Division battle. \nBurton, who scored his first varsity touchdown against Franklin on a 2-yard run, says he was greatly aided last year when he played behind standout linebackers Alex Annan and Taji Lowe, who’ve graduated. \n“Taji and Alex taught me so much,” Burton said. \nRELATED : P'burg football has dominated New Jersey opponents over the last two decades \nBurton figured to be in the Stateliners’ plans even before Gardner was injured. The injury gave him an opportunity to be on the field on virtually every down. \n“Josh has done a very good job offensively and defensively,’ Duffy said. “We knew Josh would certainly contribute this year. He’s been very productive. He works very hard. And he’s definitely playing much more aggressive. He’s very active. Those are his strengths.” \nBurton is happy with his progress but not necessarily satisfied. \n“I think I’m playing pretty well,” he said, “but there’s always opportunity to better yourself. I need to do a better job reading my keys.” \n“Like anybody else, Josh has areas where he can improve,” Duffy said. “He’d be the first to tell you that. But this experience is going to help him in the future.” \nDuffy indicated that Burton has an exceptionally good feel for the game. \n“He’s the type of guy that makes some of the calls for us on defense,” Duffy said. “He’s pretty bright that way.” \n“Coach Duffy signals the signs to me and I just call the plays,” Burton said. \nBurton grew up in Irvington, N.J., and moved to Phillipsburg in 2008. In addition to football, he played baseball, basketball, wrestled, and ran track when he was younger. He’s still a member of P’burg’s track and field team in the spring. \n“My mom wanted me to keep active and busy from a young age,” said Burton, who’s an uncle of P’burg junior running back Ja’Quan Jones. “Of course, schoolwork always came first. If I wasn’t doing good in school she always made sure the coaches got on me.” \nBurton considers himself a natural born leader for a reason you might not expect. \nMy name is Josh and in the Bible that means ‘Leader,’” Burton said. “I’m prepared for these moments. I have higher powers that are helping me out.” \nAt 5-foot-10 and 223 pounds, Burton has a thick frame that he uses to his advantage. \n“He plays with leverage, and that’s a testament to his off-season workouts,” Duffy said. “He’s one of the leaders with our strength and conditioning.” \nP’burg may feel it has a score to settle with Hillsborough because the Raiders dealt the Stateliners their only loss last season, 14-13. Hillsborough is coming off a 28-0 loss to unbeaten Bridgewater, which also handed P’burg its only defeat, 31-28. \nBurton thinks the Stateliners will be prepared. \n“You don’t want to downplay anybody’s ability because anyone is capable of beating you,” Burton said. “I think they’re a pretty good team. No. 1 (Kyle Kauffman) is a pretty good running back, but P’burg specializes in stopping the run.” \nRaiders quarterback Al Fisher has thrown for 535 yards and 8 touchdowns. Jackson Parham (17 catches, 211 yards, 4 TDs) is his top receiver while Kauffman (310 yards, 1 TD, 6 yards per carry) is the team’s top rusher. \n“They have big-play capability,” Duffy said. “They run some pretty good stuff. Their wide receivers can blow over top of the coverage. They’re willing to take shots. Defensively they’re always pretty active. Any time you play them you have to be well-prepared.” \nAs for Burton, Duffy sees him continually getting better. \n“The great thing about Josh is he wants to improve, and he has,” Duffy said. “I definitely have high hopes for Josh and he has high hopes for himself moving forward.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
