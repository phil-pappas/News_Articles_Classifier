South America’s soccer confederation, Conmebol, announced Friday that it had cut ties with a controversial company, Datisa, that held the marketing rights to the Centenario, according to Reuters. The tournament would bring top stars like Lionel Messi of Argentina and Neymar of Brazil to the United States for a monthlong, 16-team tournament in June. The cutting of ties would remove the biggest objection of organizers in the United States, whose concerns have raised questions about whether the tournament would be played in America — and even whether the United States national team would participate if it was moved. SEPT. 16, 2015 The tournament, a special edition of the biennial South American championship, was created in 2014 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Copa América. But in an indictment released in May, the United States Justice Department painted a picture of the event as little more than a criminal enterprise set up to bribe top soccer officials. The indictment said the main investors in Datisa conspired to win and keep hold of lucrative media-rights contracts from regional soccer confederations through the payment of up to $110 million in bribes. Several of those investors were among the executives arrested in a sweep of top soccer officials in Zurich in May. Given Datisa’s direct ties to the FIFA corruption scandal, United States Soccer has refused to host the tournament with the company as a partner. U.S. Soccer officials have been pressing Conmebol, which runs the Copa América, to end the agreement. They even skipped a meeting in Mexico City in September that had been called to try to save the troubled tournament. If the biggest stumbling block were removed, an announcement of the tournament’s dates and host cities could come soon.
