That’s kind of the name of training camp,” Casey said, after putting his squad through another marathon practice on Saturday.\nAs is usually the case for young teams, when players are fresh and healthy before the regular season begins, now is the time to work them hard, which Casey has been doing.\n“We’re OK. We’re where I thought we’d be. A little discombobulated, but, that’s why you have this whole month to get it going and we’ve just got to continue to grind out,” he said.\nA year ago, Toronto struggled mightily on the defensive glass, ranking 25th of 30 teams in defensive rebounding percentage.\n“(The) bigs have to do a better job of protecting their turf. That’s been kind of our bugaboo. Probably our biggest weakness is our rebounding,” Casey said.\n“We work too hard for those 24 seconds (on defence) not to come away with the rebound.”\nTime and again in 2014-15, the Raptors surrendered offensive rebounds to the opposition at the most inopportune of times. More often than not, those second chances were converted into extra points.\nThe team now has Jonas Valanciunas playing closer to the bucket, more size when DeMarre Carroll plays small forward and with DeMar DeRozan and Terrence Ross sticking to shooting guard, along with backup centre Bismack Biyombo, a tremendous rebounder.\nCasey sees a few players, in particular, improving the Raptors on the boards and defensively, while also making the team tougher.\nCarroll dove two rows into the stands in a recent game in California, and his effort-level appears to be wearing off on his new teammates.\n“I loved it, going after a loose ball like that. He sets the tone, the way we play,” Casey said.\n“His defensive aggressiveness is contagious. I see the other guys emulating him as far as their moves. Cracking down, initiating contact, all that stuff. I see them emulating him. I also see them emulating Bismack. JV can watch him as far as screening, rebounding, hitting people. Those things are contagious and DeMarre and Bismack both set the tone for that, and Cory (Joseph) for that matter, will do that too.”\nWORK IN PROGRESS\nWhile you can pencil in Kyle Lowry, DeRozan and Valanciunas as starters, with Joseph, Ross and Biyombo backing them up as well as Carroll starting at small forward, the rest of the plan remains in progress.\nPatrick Patterson likely starts at power forward, splitting time with Luis Scola, but that is not yet guaranteed, and Casey and his mostly new staff is still trying to determine who the backup small forward will be and who will get what likely won’t be a huge chunk of minutes remaining at power forward (Carroll will also see some time at power forward, something the team tried out at practice on Saturday).\n“We’re still evaluating everything, who plays well with whom. It’s important to see who plays with JV, who plays well with Bismack, now you’ve got Anthony Bennett playing well and James (Johnson) has not been able to go as much because of injury, so now he’s coming out of mothballs,” Casey said.\n“So we got some guys we want to look at in those rotations, not only with the first unit, but most importantly, with the second unit.”\nBennett practised and is fine after turning his ankle not long after throwing down an impressive dunk against the Lakers the other night.\n“Once we get going it’s going to be (picked) by production,” Casey said of the minutes up front.\n“We’ve got a lot of bodies at that position, so not very many at the three, other than Bruno (Caboclo), Bruno and DeMarre are the two (options at small forward).”\nSpeaking of young Caboclo, the word is he has looked good so far and has taken a big step compared to last year, when he was lost and overwhelmed by the NBA game.\nBUY-IN MATTERS\nNewcomer Scola says he is enjoying life as a Raptor.\n“I’m settling well. It’s a process, not only for me, but for all the guys that are new and probably for the guys that have been here too because a bunch of new guys come in, so it will take some time,” Scola said, “but I think it’s going well. I’m happy.”\nScola has been impressed by the commitment level of the team and the way they have been absorbing what the coaching staff is trying to teach them.\n“Nothing will work if everybody involved doesn’t believe in it and believe to a very high level,” he said.\n“You can bring best system ever and it’s not going to work if you don’t believe in it.”\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nOn the defensive end, Raptors still a work in progress\nBy Ryan Wolstat , Toronto Sun First posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 06:57 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 10, 2015 07:20 PM EDT\n Nearly half-way through the pre-season schedule, Dwane Casey’s Raptors are about where the coach figured they would be — in need of a lot more fine-tuning.\n“There are some bright spots and some not so bright spots.
