Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: I worry about A&M's running game once they hit SEC play. Carson is good but not great and I think the same is probably true of James White. I worry they're going to find themselves in third-and-long a lot. Your thoughts?\nKate Hairopoulos: Agree that Carson and White are really similar players, kind of bigger, physical guys, and they don't really have the lightning quick guys. For all that's been made of the philosophical and schematic changes to help A&M run better, you can see what they've been working on in recent weeks in using tight ends and h-backs, etc., and they said they've been trying to run even when the numbers aren't in their favor. I still wonder if they'll be able to run the ball when they have to in third-and-short.\nQuestion: If Kenny Hill ever resurfaces, do you expect he can duplicate the early success he had at A&M at TCU?\nKate Hairopoulos: I hope so. The reports I've read out of Fort Worth are that things have been going well for him while he's redshirting this season. I don't think his success through the early part of the season and at South Carolina were a fluke.\nQuestion: What do you see as Texas A&M's most difficult game the rest of the way?\nKate Hairopoulos: Gotta be LSU. It's at LSU. They could be playing for something in the final regular season game. And as mentioned below, LSU has always had A&M's number. This year, there will also be plenty of chatter about John Chavis' return. Now, Alabama and Ole Miss are still looking like two tough games as well. What do you think?\nQuestion: Will Myles Garrett one day be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft?\nKate Hairopoulos: If not first, he'll be up there close to it. What seems to be great for Myles is that the coaches say he's working very hard, not just relying on his undeniable talent. That said, the challenge is still to be great for an entire season as the better defenses and double and triple teams continue. He said he was exhausted last week against Nevada and went out and got those back-to-back sacks in the fourth quarter so he could be done. Worn out from having two wisdom teeth removed and cramps.\nQuestion: I didn't get a chance to watch the Nevada game -- what is the most pressing issue that must get fixed by the Aggies?\nKate Hairopoulos: Pass protection from the offensive line, taking care of the ball (fumble lost in the end zone and INT), third down efficiency (4 of 12) and three times settling for field goals (though good for picked-on Taylor Bertolet that he's perfect this season).\nQuestion: How many coaches do you think know their opponents' next game? Seems like Kliff is still keeping up with A&M in his shot at Arkansas. Does he still have some good ties there? Could that help create a series in the near future?\nKate Hairopoulos: I don't think they'd be eager to play each other because of the ties. Sumlin gave Kliff his start in the coaching biz. Offensive coordinator Jake Spavital and Kingsbury are best friends. And Jake's brother is on Kingsbury's staff at Tech.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-24T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:52:08.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
