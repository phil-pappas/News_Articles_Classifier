The freshman won the Big North Liberty championship with his third race of less than 17 minutes this year at Garret Mountain, the first time any Passaic County freshman has done that. It puts him in line to become the first freshman boy to win the Passaic County title Oct. 23.\n“I know I can run faster,” said Jordan, who ran 16:48 at the Liberty meet, 12 seconds faster than Wayne Hills senior George Galkin ran in winning the Independence meet on the same day. “I did what I needed to do today but I have a goal of 16:20 this year.”\nGalkin has run 16:43 this year at Garret.\n-- The division of non-public schools from public schools in the Bergen County Cross-Country championships was made complete when the Bergen County Women’s Coaches Association approved the proposal several weeks ago. That puts Dwight-Englewood, Saddle River Day and St. Mary’s into the same division as Don Bosco, Bergen Catholic, IHA and Holy Angels in the meet Oct. 24. The BCWCA has promised to revisit the issue after the Lou Molino Memorial Meet of Champions.\n-- Qualifiers for the Meet of Champions will be the top two teams and 10 individuals from each of the five groups, along with three team wild cards based on total team time and 10 wild card individuals who do not otherwise qualify.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:35:00.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
