When the New York Mets won that World Series, Gibbons was something of an afterthought.\nHe had been called up in August to replace the injured Gary Carter. He spent October as the bullpen catcher. He wasn’t on the playoff roster.\nWhen the champagne was sprayed in celebration, “I kind of stayed out of it,” he said. “I didn’t think it was my place to get involved. I didn’t really feel like I was part of that team.”\nHe doesn’t want to stay out of it now.\nThe World Series ring he so desires is 11 wins away. This is his opportunity — and he knows it, understands it. His chance to be a baseball somebody. He knows he’s not necessarily popular outside of his own clubhouse. He knows what some think of him — that he’s never the reason the Blue Jays win, the story goes, only the reason they lose. The world isn’t always sure what to make of his mumbling, his self-deprecating humour, his lack of modern-day sound bytes.\nThis is Gibbons’ first time on the big stage. His possible coming-out party.\n“Yes, it could be that,” said Gibbons in a lengthy and rare one-on-one interview. “I’m not looking for that, necessarily. The attention is going to be on the games, on the team, not on me.\n“I know what people think ... I hear it sometimes. I want to be known as a good baseball guy. In the baseball world, I’m viewed that way. And I want to be known as a good individual. If my legacy is as a good father and husband, then that’s what matters most to me.”\nBut something else matters: Winning with this opportunity. There are a lot of good baseball people who never make it to the big leagues, who never get this kind of opportunity. Gibbons thinks about them — he used to be one of them.\n“A lot of times, it’s luck of the draw. Right place, right time,” said Gibbons. “Baseball isn’t rocket science. Sure, there’s something to those who win all the time — they’re definitely on the ball — I would love to be in that category but I don’t obsess over it.\n“This would mean everything to me, but this isn’t about me. I’ve been here a while, but not long like some people. For the franchise, the city, really the country, it’s been so long.\n“I don’t mind staying in the background. I never wanted to manage in the big leagues just to say I managed in the big leagues. I want to manage a winner. That’s the whole idea, isn’t it?”\n***\nJohn Gibbons won a championship in his first season managing in the rookie Appalachian League. He did it again in his second year in the Florida State League. That was in 1996. He was on the fast track as a hot guy in the Mets organization. He hasn’t won a championship since.\nThe first year, he remembers, was the best year. Or, in his Gibby-speak, “the funnest year.\n“I was the manager,” he said, “but that was just part of what I did. Our guys in Kingsport, Tenn., didn’t have cars. We had a team van. Every game day, I would drive the van all over town, pick up our guys, and take them to the ball park. The guy who owned our team was a big defence lawyer in town and his one grounds-crew guy was on parole. About a week into the season, he violated his parole and he was back in the slammer.\n“So I would drive around town, pick our guys up, get dressed, go down the right field line, get the tractor, drag the field, then set up the field and then we’d do our early work. There was only two men on our staff — me and the pitching coach — and a few days after we broke spring training, our pitching coach broke his throwing hand. So he can’t throw batting practice. I’m basically throwing all the BP, doing all the grounds-crew work, and after the games, I’d round up the boys and drop them all home and then go back to my place and relax.\n“Crazy, when you think about it, but it was probably the most fun time I’ve had — my first shot at managing — my fondest memory in the game.”\nThe reason he won the championship that first year?\n“Good players,” he said. “It’s always come down to that. You win when you have good players.”\n***\nIf Buck Martinez had not been fired as manager of the Blue Jays in May 2002, the odds are John Gibbons would never have become Jays manager.\nGibbons had gone as far as he would go in the Mets organization. He managed three years at triple-A Norfolk and was not at any time invited to join the big-league team. It was time to get another job. That turned out to be more difficult than he had imagined.\n“My kids were getting a little older, I didn’t want to keep dragging them around the country,” he said. “The Mets offered me my job back. I told them I wasn’t going back.”\nHe called his friends Billy Beane and J.P. Ricciardi with the Oakland A’s looking for work. There wasn’t anything there. Beane had been selected in the first round of the 1980 baseball draft by the Mets. One pick after him, the Mets chose Gibbons. One pick before Beane, the Expos took Terry Francona, and the pick before that, Atlanta selected pitcher Jim Acker.\n“I remember calling Billy and he said he couldn’t talk, something was up with J.P. That’s when J.P. got hired by the Blue Jays.\n“I was under some pressure. We had three kids, had just bought a house in San Antonio and I had two weeks left in my contract. It was a nervous time. J.P. called me and said he had two jobs he could interview me for. A third base coach and a bullpen catcher. He interviewed me and Carlos Tosca. Carlos got the third base job. And after that, J.P. said, ‘I’ll pay you the same as they were paying you in triple-A if you take the bullpen job.’\n“I’m thinking, ‘I can’t do that.’ I couldn’t squat anymore. I flew home figuring I needed a job. But nothing was happening. I end up taking the bullpen job, going to spring training and, on my first day squatting to catch, my knee blew up on me. I was the only bullpen catcher in baseball who couldn’t catch.\n“So the season starts and I’m barely able to get it done. We don’t have great pitching and, every night, everybody and his brother are throwing by necessity. I’m catching them all on one knee. About a month in, I figure I’ve got another month of this, no more. There was no way I could physically do this anymore.”\nFifty three games into that season, Martinez — now the Blue Jays’ play-by-play man — was fired by Ricciardi. Tosca was named manager. Gibbons moved from bullpen catcher to first base coach. Ricciardi hired Brian Butterfield to coach third base.\n“If that doesn’t happen,” said Gibbons, “I don’t think I ever manage a big-league game.”\nWhen Tosca was fired in 2004, Gibbons was named Blue Jays manager for the first time.\n***\nWhen Joe Carter hit the home run to win the 1993 World Series, Gibbons was working at the instructional league in Florida with the Mets. Coaching in the morning, fishing in the afternoon, some beer and baseball at night.\nFour months earlier, the Montreal Canadiens won the Stanley Cup, the eighth Canadian-based team to become champion in a 10-year period in the NHL.\nSince then, 22 years without Canadian champions.\n“That’s amazing,” said Gibbons. “I knew how long it was for us. I didn’t know how long it was for Canada.”\nWith that to carry around, what will he say to his team as they begin baseball’s post-season, many of them, including Gibbons, for the first time? He said the same as he always says — next to nothing.\n“Baseball, the more you talk, the less they listen,” said Gibbons. “I haven’t had to have a team meeting all year. First time I can say that. I never felt a need for it.\n“I know this team. They want to play. They don’t want to hear from me.”\nEmail: steve.simmons@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter: @simmonssteve\nSIMMONS\nPlayoffs could be coming-out party for John Gibbons 'I want to manage a winner.
