But, just for good measure, the Broncos had extra motivation Oct 12. In Platte Valley’s 3-0 win against the Bulldogs, the Broncos named Bo Miller their honorary team captain. Miller, 16, born and raised in Kersey, is a Platte Valley sophomore. He was diagnosed with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia this past summer. Every season, during their Cancer Awareness Night, the Broncos raise money for a community member who has cancer. This Cancer Awareness Night was particularly special, Platte Valley coach Jared Rudiger said. “It kind of hit home more, having a student in the building, and just seeing that he actually had treatment today and to see what he’s going through,” Rudiger said. “We told our kids to keep life in perspective from a volleyball standpoint. We’re playing for something bigger tonight, for Bo.” Miller’s form of leukemia has one of the highest curability rates. Miller said it was heartwarming and a bit awe-inspiring to see a packed gymnasium full of schoolmates, friends, family and community members donate money, wear T-shirts and contribute to a silent auction in support of him and his family. “I didn’t really know that I’d have this much support,” Miller said. “Before any of this happened, I didn’t expect this much out of the community. But, it’s really nice. It’s extremely encouraging.” And, as encouraged as Miller was by the showing of support, Platte Valley players were every bit as motivated to perform well with their honorary captain watching intently from courtside. “We were extremely excited just knowing everything Bo’s been through,” said Maggie Smith, the Broncos’ senior outside hitter and co-team captain. “He’s my younger brother (Eric’s) age, so that kind of hits home a little bit more. He’s a really cool kid, and just being able to go out there and do something for someone else that’s so much bigger than just our little team is just very exciting.” Smith and the rest of her Platte Valley teammates donned pink uniforms during the match. Their choice of attire was one of many ways the Broncos showed they were playing for a greater cause. “We were just playing for something bigger than ourselves,” freshman setter Maddie Uyemura said. “So, it was really cool.” Bobby Fernandez covers county schools sports for The Tribune.
