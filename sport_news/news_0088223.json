Parrish \nDemocrat Editor \nThe following sentence appears in my game story that will print Wednesday: It is the worst loss in the 48-year history of Bearcat Stadium. \nAustin Ware’s 66-yard fourth quarter run, with the extra point, pushed Lamar’s point total to 54. It was the first time an opponent had scored over 50 points in the 48-year history of the stadium. \nThat also set the deficit at 47 points – 54-7 – which is also the worst beating handed a Bearcat in its own house. And it came at the hands of Booneville graduate Josh Jones. \nEven before the final touchdown, the 47-7 score had already surpassed the largest loss, which had stood since 1971 when Van Buren won here 47-8. \nPrior to Friday the all time high in Bearcat Stadium by an opponent had been 49 points by Pottsville in a 49-21 win that marked the first mercy rule home loss. \nCoaching Pottsville in that game, and still, was Booneville graduate Bryan Rust. \nAmong the opponents nearing the 50-point mark in a game at Booneville include 48- and 47-point nights in which the opponent actually lost – 56-48 over Ozark in 1999 and 63-47 against Hoxie last season. \nOtherwise, only Walnut Ridge lit up a scoreboard here in 1982, 45-24 in a playoff game in 1982 and Greenwood in a 40-6 win in 1971.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:00:28.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
