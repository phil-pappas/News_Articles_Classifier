As Willamette Week and The Oregonian/Oregonlive recently reported, the district's general counsel determined that the performance by a school-sponsored student group at the venue during its Christmas Festival of Lights could be mistaken for an endorsement of The Grotto's Catholic mission. After all, not only do visitors have to pay admission for festival activities at the 62-acre national sanctuary, but the setting, with its statues and Catholic literature, comes across as deeply religious, the district notes.\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms\nRead more about the editorial board's priorities for Oregon.\nConsidering that many other school districts continue to send their choirs to the festival, the decision seems like an overreaction to a climate increasingly suspicious of any religious affiliations. Five Portland Public Schools choirs were among the 150 school, church and civic choirs scheduled to participate in this year's festival, which runs from the day after Thanksgiving until Dec. 30. While there's no denying the religious nature of the performances – this is Christmas after all - the choirs sing a variety of songs, including those celebrating other faiths, said Jennifer O'Leary, a 1995 Grant High School graduate who performed for four years at The Grotto's festival and has started a petition asking the district to change its mind. The ban not only ends a tradition of more than two decades but takes away a rare opportunity for local students to perform at a venue with acoustics rivaling those of European cathedrals, said O'Leary, a professional singer who has performed in Europe.\nIt's also hard to take the district at its word that it's simply acting on a complaint that it received. Portland Public Schools general counsel Jollee Patterson told The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board that she received a written complaint from Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation in November 2014 on behalf of a concerned parent. (A previous complaint by the group , sent in December 2013, never arrived in her office, she said). Patterson said she found merit to the group's concerns and sent school administrators an email more than a month ago telling them of The Grotto performance ban. However, as of Monday, she still had not yet told the Wisconsin organization of the district's change of heart.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

The district also acknowledged it does not ban all relationships with faith-based organizations: Consider its multimillion-dollar partnership with Concordia University, a private Christian university. The district and Concordia are jointly investing in a new school facility to house both Faubion PK-8 and Concordia's College of Education. But The Grotto's overtly religious setting worried the district about the message that it might be sending.\nSome might have more issues with the school district's longterm financial and educational partnership with Concordia than with its allowing student choirs to perform voluntarily at a religious venue during the holiday season. But both instances can provide educational opportunities to students who all too often see those enrichment possibilities shut down.\nEducation should be about exposing students to other views - not ignoring their existence. Strangely, we have arrived at a point where basic curricular activities such as standardized testing have become optional even as officials ignore the preferences of those who participate in extracurricular activities such as school choirs.\nO'Leary said she plans to bring the matter up to the Portland School Board at a meeting later this month. The hope, she said, is to persuade them to overturn the staff's decision. But if that fails, there needs to be a better discussion of what happened and what might happen in the future.\n\"I'm hoping that this can also just start a dialogue for how we handle our differences of beliefs and things like that,\" she said.\nIn other words, how do we achieve inclusion? For the school district, that word should ring a bell.\n– The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/faubion/690.htm", "https://www.change.org/p/portland-public-schools-jollee-patterson-jon-isaacs-carole-smith-let-pps-choirs-sing-at-the-grotto?recruiter=false&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=share_page&utm_term=mob-xs-notification-custom_msg&fb_ref=Default", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wapopartners.com/wweek-wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/07150038/Portland-Public-Schools-OR-choir-performance-in-church-The-Grotto.pdf", "http://www.wweek.com/2015/10/07/portland-public-schools-orders-choirs-to-stop-singing-at-the-grotto/", "http://www.thegrotto.org/christmas/", "http://ffrf.org/"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:16:19.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
