They face the tough task of claiming their only win of the season against third-ranked Cedar Rapids Xavier in a Class 3A District 4 game Friday night at Thomas Park. \n“Winning is something that is special,” Perkins said. “We haven’t been able to enjoy that lately, but these kids are still playing the game they love. They’re still battling. That will make them successful.” \nAccording to Perkins, the Indians will be limping into the finale with a depleted lineup. They were down to just 28 healthy players at Wednesday’s practice, missing up to eight starters. He said that hasn’t squashed their efforts. \n“It’s been a good group,” Perkins said. “They’re giving me everything they’ve got.” \nPerkins has 159 career coaching wins, including 104 in 17 years coaching at Marion. He stands one win shy of tying Les Hipple for the most in school history. Perkins moved within a win of the record in the 2014 opener. Despite the challenges of the last two seasons, Perkins said he still enjoys working with the players and his assistants. \n“Seeing and being able to be around those kids out on the football field is pure joy,” Perkins said. “When you get a hug from a kid, like after the (Dubuque) Wahlert game for just getting on the football field, that’s a special time.” \nWhether there will more of those moments after this season remains in question. Perkins said his focus is on the regular-season finale, but he will evaluate the situation after the season. \n“We’ll step back and let it all settle in and then we’ll make a decision later on down the line,” Perkins said, “but these kids deserve everything that I’ve got and we’re going to finish what we’ve started.” \nPerkins praised the current seniors for sticking out through rough times. \nGage Kray moved from quarterback to wide receiver, serving more of a utility weapon on offense. Kray has more than 490 total yards with two receiving touchdowns. \n“He’s had a great year,” Perkins said of the 6-foot-3, 200-pounder. “He’s a really good college prospect.” \nKory Walsh had the chance to crack the program’s top-five in career rushing yards, but injury ended his season and prep career early. Walsh had rushing for 846 yards and four scores, giving him 2,049 and 16 since joining the varsity as a sophomore. Ryan Whalen had 275 receiving yards and two TDs when injury sidelined him for the season. \n“They are great kids,” Perkins said. “They believe that you don’t give up. You might not win, but we go into every game thinking we are going to win.” \nXavier (7-0, 5-0) is coming off a dramatic come-from-behind win over 1A top-ranked Iowa City Regina. The Indians (0-8, 0-5) will need one of their best performances of the season, eliminating the errors that have been present in previous games. \n“We need to minimize all the mistakes,” Perkins said. “They have so much team speed and size. We need to try to keep them off-balance as much as we possibly can. We have to try to do some different things.” \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:01:08.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
