Contacted by Bild, a company employee Patrick Chan denied selling any figurines based on a footballer, and said it was purely coincidental that the Nazi doll resembled Schweinsteiger.\nThe 30-cm tall figurine was \"based on the typical German\", he said. \"We thought that all Germans look like that.\"\nThe figurine, marketed as 'WWII Army Supply Duty', comes with several apparels — including a version with a steel helmet, white winter jacket and woollen gloves, and another in a typical army uniform, complete with the 'Wehrmachtsadler' insignia — an eagle with a swastika above the right breast pocket.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:49:29.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
