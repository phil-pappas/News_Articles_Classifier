Who has the early edge in inter-conference matchups? So far, the NFC is 3-1 straight up and four against the spread ... There has been some decent finishes in prime-time games, but not always a lot of scoring. So far, the overs are 1-9 verses the overs ... Interesting spot for the inconsistent Buffalo Bills, who were 2½-point favourites for most of the week over the Titans in Nashville. Tennessee has defeated Buffalo in eight of their past nine matchups, but in their past 15 home games, they have covered just twice. \nThe Packers are big 8½ point faves over the visiting Rams. Green Bay, though, isn’t shy about covering a big number and are a perfect 4-0 against the spread this season. How good are the Pack in covering a big number? They have covered 12 of their past 16 when favoured by a touchdown or more ... Another of those 4-0 ATS teams, the Cincinnati Bengals are a touchdown favourite over the visiting (and struggling) Seattle Seahawks. The Bengals are one of the best home bets going, too, covering 15 of their past 19 on the banks of the Ohio River. \nIn the past 22 times the Seahawks were underdogs, they covered 17 times ... If you like the Patriots in Dallas today, you have to give up 8½ points, a huge number for a road team. \nBut the way Tom Brady has been so far, how do you bet against them. Against Jacksonville, the Pats scored on all nine drives Brady was in the game and running the offence. The Cowboys, who are still without quarterback Tony Romo, have covered 17 times in the past 20 occasions that they were an underdog of a field goal or more. \nRANDALL THE HANDLE'S ODDS ON \nHome-field advantage has a whole new meaning when it comes to the Packers. Since 2010, they’ve won 37 of 41 here at Lambeau while covering at a 29-11-1 clip in those contests. Green Bay has also outscored its visitors by a combined 589 points during that span, winning by more than 14 points per game on average. The Rams will attempt to dent those numbers as a 9½-point underdog here today but they may have their work cut out for them. The Packers will be home again next week as they host the Chargers. Early lines suggest that Green Bay will be a 9-point favourite next Sunday. The significance being that over the past five seasons, teams that are favoured by six or more points in the week prior to being six or more again, have cashed in at a 107-65 mark versus the spread … Not sure what prompted Friday’s bevy of activity on the Bills game but after Buffalo was a 2½-point favourite for most of the week, action poured in on the Titans, driving the line down to Buffalo -1. Without any notable personnel changes, one has to wonder if that line movement is an indictment of the Bills or a vote of confidence on the Titans? ... Three teams reside in Florida. One is worse than the next. Two of them square off today as Jacksonville visits Tampa Bay. How bad is it, you ask? It’s so bad that the Jaguars have lost 12 straight on the road, dating back to November, 2013 while the Bucs have now lost 11 straight at home, dating back to late 2013 as well. Tampa remains a three-point pick for this doozy … While it’s not an exact science, some books are reporting a huge 90% of all spread bets being placed on the Patriots (-8½) today. It is rare to see such bias and often, it blows up in the public’s face … An interesting prop posted by the folks at Bodog.ca this week asks —‘Will all six undefeated NFL teams make the playoffs?’ with YES -2.50 and the NO offering +1.75. That group would include the Patriots, Bengals, Broncos, Packers, Falcons and Panthers. \nDAN BILICKI'S FANTASY UPDATE \nWhile Marshawn Lynch was ruled out of this week’s tilt with the Cincinnati Bengals on Friday, the Seattle Seahawk’s status we are now waiting on is Fred Jackson’s high-ankle sprain. While Thomas Rawls will start once again in Lynch’s absence, Jackson will take away some touches — especially in the passing game — if he plays through the injury, which seems likely. \nn It’s almost certain that Bears wideout Alshon Jeffery will miss his fourth straight game with a hamstring injury. It’s a real shame too, as he and QB Jay Cutler would’ve had a chance to run rampant on a Chiefs defence that has allowed the most fantasy points to opposing WRs this season. \nDAN BILICKI'S BE A SURVIVOR \nJay Cutler may be back for the Bears, but that doesn’t mean they’ll put up much of a fight in Kansas City. The Chiefs may be on a three-game losing streak, but they have faced three of the best teams in the league in that streak. This should be a must-win contest for them. \nIf not for two terrible mistakes, the Giants could be sitting at 4-0 right now. They’ll be taking on a 49ers team that has looked terrible since their shock win in Week 1, losing by double-digits three weeks straight. We wouldn’t back Colin Kaepernick in prime time — or in general — right now. \nHeading into Lambeau Field, where Aaron Rodgers is seemingly immortal, is always a tough task. With the Rams coming off a huge rivalry win and their eyes set on a bye next week, you have to wonder if they’ll have the focus to take down Green Bay. It’s probably safe to back the Pack.
