Zapata finished with a time of 22 minutes, 7.8 seconds, going from eighth place at the midway point to second behind Incarnate Word’s Christian Castaneda (21:30). Sova finished the 6K race with a time of 22:19.3. \n“Jennifer ran a very smart race as she worked her way up from eighth place at the midway point in the race to finish in second,” Vaqueros assistant coach Rob Hansen said. “Sova ran a little more gutsy than usual, and I think she was able to take away a valuable experience in her third-place run. We are proud of the whole team’s progress over the past month. The future is bright for the program.” \nFreshman Thalia Polanco (22:53.5) finished 12th, and junior Savanna Antley (23:45.7) was 21st. Sophomore Roxanna Vidaurri (24:03.0) took 28th place, and sophomore Alexandria Munoz (24:03.0) was 36th. \nFreshman Alexis Gonzalez placed one spot behind Munoz (25:37.5), and freshman Zulema Mendez (28:15.8) finished 39th. \nThe women’s team ended up third with 62 points, two points behind Texas A&M-Corpus Christi. Incarnate Word won with 41 points. \nOn the men’s side, senior Jose Juan Wells placed third among Division I runners after completing the 8K race in 24:34.1. Wells finished less than nine seconds behind Incarnate Word’s Garrett Cortez (24:25.2), who was second to Texas State’s Logan Pittdman (24:21.7). \nSophomore Jeremiah Kiplagat posted a personal-best time of 25:08.6 to finish 16th, and sophomore Rick Montero (25:25.0) was one spot behind him in 17th place. Freshman Angel Montanez came in 26th place after posting a personal-best time of 25:55.6, and freshman Isaac Arevalo (26:07.8) was 31st. \n“Juan stuck his nose up front and ran like a true seasoned veteran today,” Hansen said. “It was by far his best cross country race as a Vaquero. Kiplagat and Montanez both had breakthrough races in being conservative in their early stages of their respective races. They worked their way up and earned huge personal bests. I am enthusiastic about how this team can grow going forward.” \nFreshman Mathew Peynado (26:15.1) came in two spots behind Arevalo in 33rd, and freshman Rene Guillen (26:31.9) took 38th. Sophomore Martin Perez (26:32.4) was 39th, and freshman Carlos Roguera (27:07.2) ended up 42nd. \nAs a team, the men finished fifth with 91 points, 17 behind TCU. Texas A&M-Corpus Christi won with 45 points. \nThe Vaqueros are back in action Oct. 16 when they travel to Tuscaloosa, Ala., to compete in the University of Alabama’s Crimson Classic. \n— UTRGV Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:18:58.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
