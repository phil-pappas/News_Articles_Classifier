So, I think I’ll refrain from doing so.” \nMiles said on Monday that film of what he and his staff viewed as late hits of Fournette in the Tigers’ 35-28 win over Florida on Saturday were sent to the SEC office. Fournette gained 180 yards on a career-high 31 carries in the game and complained of several illegal grabs to his face mask during the game. Fournette also took a swing with his left hand at a Florida defender during a run. \nSEC coordinator of football officials Steve Shaw did not immediately return a call to his office. \n“We have open dialogue,” Miles said of the SEC office. “And basically what happens many times is they tell us how to operate, what the ruling is, so that we can teach it best. I think there’s real quality open dialogue between the officiating, Steve Shaw, and really the rest of the coaches.” Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/2015/10/21/miles-not-commenting-sec-response-fournette-hits/74330106/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:45:01.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
