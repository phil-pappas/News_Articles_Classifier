One ally less does not help its cause and the party doesn't see the merit of becoming dependent on the Nationalist Congress Party, an outfit seen to be singularly transactional about its politics.\nThe challenge for the Maharashtra government is in acting against Sena members responsible for the black paint attack on Sudheendra Kulkarni, a former aide of L K Advani, who were feted as heroes by party chief Uddhav Thackeray.\nThe task is not easy as Fadnavis had categorically said the attack on Kulkarni, for having organized a book release function of former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mehmud Kasuri, has lowered Mumbai's prestige and promised action against those responsible.\nSena has thrown the gauntlet and Fadnavis and BJP will be under pressure to respond. The party is unlikely to do so in a hurry as that might precipitate a crisis at a time when BJP is in the midst of a crucial election in Bihar and does not have an alternate plan ready.\nBJP can allow Sena to carry on with its intimidation only at the risk of its government in Maharashtra losing credibility, a development that can also impact efforts to woo domestic and foreign investment.\nBJP's relations with Sena have had their tense moments, most famously when the late Balasaheb Thackeray was briefly arrested and let off on bail in 2000 over a case of alleged inflammatory writing. But on the whole, the alliance survived till the break before the 2014 assembly elections.\nBJP leaders have pointed out that even if the Sena had accepted the final offer of seats for the assembly polls, it would have had its chief minister. Now, it must put up with Fadnavis while also having to contend with the breakaway MNS led by Raj Thackeray.
