The run was called back because of a penalty, but Clayberg led the top-ranked Little Dutch to a 47-7 win over Newton. By Newton Daily News Sports Staff \nBlowouts were the norm for all five area high school football teams in Friday night's games.

The undefeated Little Dutch set sail to a 47-7 win in the first drive — two plays — the game. \n“I’m very proud of the way our guys fought. We focused all week on being competitive with Pella and we were,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said. “Our run defense against Nathan Henry was outstanding.” \nHenry, Pella’s senior running back, scored twice in the first quarter on runs of 16 yards and 3 yards, There were times when the Cardinal defense shut down one of the top running backs in the state.

He flipped the two-point conversion to Will Warner to amok it 28-0.

We can build on this for next week.” \nNewton (0-7) goes on the road to play Bondurant-Farrar in Class 3A District 6 action Friday. \nNewton's freshmen lost, 29-7, to Pella. \nLynnville-Sully 72, GMG 0 \nSULLY — The Hawks moved above .500 for the second time this year after jumping out to a 43-0 lead after one quarter. \nSage Ehresman rushed for 79 yards and three touchdowns on six carries and Evan Squires gained 58 yards and scored twice on five touches. \nSage Zylstra had four tackles and three sacks to lead a Lynnville-Sully defense that held GMG to 63 total yards.
