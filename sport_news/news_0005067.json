Platini's status has been described by the Swiss attorney general as ''in between a witness and accused person''. \nThe UEFA president is still determined to stand for the FIFA presidency and has said the delay was because of FIFA's financial position at the time, but has not explained why there was a wait of nine years. \nBlatter is also under investigation for TV rights deals he signed off to former Caribbean football chief Jack Warner, who sold them on for a Â£11million profit, and Rauball said Blatter should leave immediately rather than wait until February. \n\"I can imagine that if he stays until February he might get the idea to say: 'Well, if no other candidate is there then I will stay on',\" Rauball said. \n\"It's about time to consider a plan B. The U.S. justice department has classified FIFA as influenced by organised crime and corruption.\" \nMeanwhile, reports in Brazil say former Brazilian federation president Jose Maria Marin has agreed a deal with the US justice department that will see him extradited from Switzerland and live under house arrest in his apartment in New York's Trump Towers. \nMarin was one of seven FIFA officials arrested in May and will pay 10million US dollars (Â£6.6million) in bail, according to Estado de Sao Paulo.
