Families need a synagogue within walking distance, because their interpretation of Jewish law prohibits driving on the Sabbath. They need a Jewish school for their kids, ample kosher food options and a mikvah, which is a ritual bath. Some kind of adult education group is a plus.\nPortland offered little of this in the 1990s, when young Fried's Orthodox family arrived. She left for a decade – for college, marriage – and returned this year to find the Orthodox community blossoming.\nIt's been a slow evolution: First, the Orthodox population grew large enough in the Hillsdale area to demand greater infrastructure: local grocers bolstered their kosher sections, a school opened, and Fried's former synagogue moved to the neighborhood.\nGreater infrastructure, in turn, has made Portland an option for other observant families. Newcomers are filling seats in schools and synagogues, including Congregation Kesser Israel , where holiday worshippers barely squeezed inside last month.\n\"There's this energy now,\" Fried said.\nThe 28-year-old's family is just one of several new additions to Kesser Israel, where the congregation has doubled from about 65 families to 125 since Rabbi Ken Brodkin took over in 2005.\nMany families attribute recent neighborhood influx to the 2011 opening of Maayan Torah Day School of Portland , the region's second Orthodox school. A small school founded by Chabad, a Hasidic sect, has operated since 1985.\nIn four years, Maayan Torah Day School grew from a dozen families to 74, said principal Aviel Brodkin, Rabbi Brodkin's wife.\nAll those families need places to shop. In recent years, Safeway and Fred Meyer locations near the Orthodox community have expanded their kosher sections and three dessert spots – a frozen yogurt joint, ice cream shop and Krispy Kreme location – earned kosher certification.\nThe timing of the Portland Orthodox community's breakthrough is likely the result of two grander trends: Portland's takeoff as a West Coast destination and growth in Orthodoxy nationally.\nOrthodox Jews nationwide are younger and have more children than the much larger, more theologically liberal Conservative and Reform branches, according to a 2013 report from the Pew Research Center .\nThe study also suggested Orthodox followers will make up a larger segment of America's Jewish population in coming years because young people are keeping the faith into adulthood.\n\"When we look at society at large, we are losing a sense of community,\" said Rabbi Michael Kaplan, head of Congregation Ahavath Achim, an Orthodox synagogue that's also seen growth. \"Face to face human interactions are being replaced by electronics. I think people are feeling that loss and looking to reconnect.\"\nFor the fledgling Orthodox community, dozens of new families per year feels exponential.\n\"There's a little bit of a buzz,\" said Rabbi Brodkin.\nBut that's still minuscule in the grand scheme of Portland's Jewish community, which the Jewish Federation of Portland estimates to be nearly 50,000 strong. That includes thousands of people – many more than make up the Orthodox community – who aren't religious at all.\n\"If I want to have a cradle to grave experience, and I want my family to be in the bosom of the Jewish community, Portland is not the place for me,\" said Caron Blau Rothstein, the federation's community engagement director.\nIt isn't quite the place, fully, even for invested families. Without an Orthodox Jewish high school, some have left when their children outgrew the community's offerings. Even the Brodkins, who are as invested as anyone in improving Portland's Orthodox community, recently sent their son to Washington, D.C. for private high school.\nFor now, Portland's Orthodox isn't strong enough to attract newcomers on its own, but it's enough to make the City of Roses a realistic option for families already interested in settling or staying here.\n\"You have to be a certain kind of orthodox person. Maybe you're in the high tech industry. Maybe they want to be a naturopath,\" said Rothstein.\n\"Outside of places like New York and L.A., there has to be a ceiling.\"\nFor now, congregants at the city's largest Orthodox synagogue are worried about seats, not ceilings.\nAt this year's Rosh Hashanah service, Kesser Israel worshippers packed into the aisles and women rubbed shoulders to keep from spilling over to the men's side of the synagogue.\n\"We need a new building,\" a woman whispered to another, raising an eyebrow. \"And soon.\"\n-- Melissa Binder\nmbinder@oregonian.com\n503-294-7656\n@binderpdx", "external_links": ["http://www.jewishportland.org/", "http://www.portlandjewishdayschool.org/", "http://www.kesserisrael.org/home", "http://www.maimonidesjds.org/", "http://twitter.com/binderpdx", "http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:32:40.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
