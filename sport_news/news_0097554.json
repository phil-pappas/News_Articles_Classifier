Kolton Dunkelberger (19th, 15:43.7), Alex Olar (22nd, 15:48.5) and Tanner Heiple (26th, 15:57.9) won the medals. Robbie Lawrence (58th, 16:44.7) and Chase Paul (66th, 16:53.5) also scored for the Dragons and dipped under the 17-minute mark on the 2.94-mile course. Despite the good day, “the consensus among the guys is we can run better,” said Pekin coach Cole Stoner. “The challenge is to prove that Friday at Detweiller Park in the Mid-Illini Conference meet.” The Dragons were sixth among 21 teams in the Runnin’ Red race. They scored 191 points. Mahomet-Seymour (26), Metamora (114), Peoria Notre Dame (122), Springfield (134) and Dunlap (181) finished in front of Pekin. East Peoria (11th, 300), Olympia (16th, 446) and Washington (19th, 522) trailed the Dragons. Mahomet-Seymour’s Alex Keeble won the race (14:37.7). Metamora’s Jake Gillum was second (14:50.6). Led by medalist Paige Arseneau (23rd, 18:35.8) and Candice Boldt (40th, personal-record 19:20.3), the Pekin girls team finished ninth among 23 teams. Madison Stoller (45th, 19:26.0), Danielle Walker (83rd, 20:57.7) and Jayna Riley (85th, 21:08.0) also scored for the Lady Dragons. “We need to work on closing the gap between our runners,” said Pekin coach Erika Gilmore. State-ranked Dunlap won the team title with 45 points. Palatine (61), Washington (137), Decatur St. Teresa (179) and Metamora (208) rounded out the top five. Deer Creek-Mackinaw (359), East Peoria (547) and Limestone (557) trailed Pekin. Defending Class 2A state champion Maryjeanne Gilbert of Notre Dame won the race (16:49.0). Spikers roll on The Pekin volleyball team took care of business Thursday, beating host East Peoria 25-11, 25-12 in a Mid-Illini Conference match. Hannah Thompson had eight kills and five digs for the Lady Dragons (18-7, 7-3). Haley Peterson dished out 13 assists. East Peoria fell to 1-9 in the conference. Not an invitational Coach Mitch Richards said it was another case of the weekday blues Thursday for the Pekin girls swimming and diving team. Host Peoria Richwoods beat the Lady Dragons 95-88. That was better than the 120-65 drubbing Richwoods inflicted on Pekin last year, but disappointing nonetheless. “We had some close races that just didn’t go our way,” Richards said. “We beat Richwoods at their invitational (Oct. 3), but an invitational isn’t a dual meet and Richwoods proved that. Richwoods came to swim (Thursday) and our tiredness showed in almost every event.” There were some bright spots for Pekin. Shae Campbell won the 200 individual medley (2:29.27) and Claire Whiting won the 100 backstroke (1:12.16) in close races and Kelen McDaniels won the 200 freestyle (2:03.38) and 100 butterfly (1:03.27). Campbell, Whiting and McDaniels are freshmen. Not so rosy Page 2 of 2 - Monmouth-Roseville defeated visiting Pekin 7-1 Thursday in a non-conference boys soccer game. The game was a late addition to the Dragons’ schedule after a non-conference game Saturday at Springfield Southeast was canceled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:37:44.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
