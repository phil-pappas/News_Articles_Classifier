Through 10 games (for most teams), there are still several contenders for the top spot. This week, Braintree dethroned Silver Lake, while the Weymouth girls make it three weeks in a row at No. 1. There was a lot of movement on the boys’ side, while the girls’ top six remains relatively the same. Here are the week five rankings; last week’s ranking is in parentheses. Also check out the players of the week. BOYS 1. Braintree (2) - If it wasn’t evident before, it sure is now. Braintree is the team to beat on the South Shore. Three up, three down last week for the Wamps, who defeated Wellesley, Archbishop Williams, and Newton North and improved to 11-1-1, qualifying for the postseason tournament. 2. Hingham (3) - The Harbormen continue to climb up the rankings, and after beating Silver Lake, 2-1, and blanking North Quincy last week, they move up to No. 2 and come into the week at 6-2-2. 3. Silver Lake (1) - The Lakers (7-1-2) had a rough go this week, falling to Patriot League rival Hingham, suffering their first loss of the season. They barely escaped a league match against Plymouth South, coming away with a 1-0 victory. 4. Norwell (5) - The Clippers jump up one spot to No. 4 after beating both Randolph and East Bridgewater handily. They pushed their record to 9-2 in the process and are the frontrunners to take home the South Shore League title at the halfway point. 5. Pembroke (4) - Down one spot to No. 5, the Titans tied Scituate, 1-1, and beat Whitman-Hanson by one goal. They still remain a legitimate threat in the Patriot League, coming into the week with a 5-3-2 overall mark. 6. Scituate (NR) - The Sailors cruise back into the top six after sitting on the bubble last week. They beat Duxbury, 1-0, and tied Pembroke, 1-1; quite an impressive week for the Scituate boys. On the bubble: Plymouth South, Rockland, Weymouth Player of the Week - Ben Sandham (Scituate) - The senior midfielder accounted for both of his team’s goals last week, and what massive goals they were for the Sailors. Sandham netted the game-winner in a huge, 1-0 win over Duxbury and added the game-tying tally in a 1-1 draw against No. 5 Pembroke. GIRLS 1. Weymouth (1) - The Wildcats earn the No. 1 spot for the third week in a row after posting a pair of impressive victories, one each against Framingham and Walpole to improve to 8-2. 2. Scituate (2) - The Sailors remain at No. 2 following a week that produced a 1-1 draw against Pembroke. They pushed their record to 6-0-3 in the process. 3. Marshfield (3) - The Rams were perfect on the week, picking up two, 3-0 victories in the Atlantic Coast League. They beat Falmouth and Nauset to improve to 7-3-2. 4. Norwell (5) - Here come the Clippers (9-2-2), who jump up one spot to No. 4 after ending East Bridgewater’s bid for a perfect season. They beat the defending Div. 4 state champions, 1-0, and followed it up with a commanding win over Randolph. 5. Silver Lake (4) - The Lakers drop one spot to No. 5 after losing to unranked Hingham. They did pick up wins against Plymouth South and Quincy to push their record to 7-3-1. 6. Carver (6) - The Crusaders had yet another stellar week, going 3-0, all in the South Shore League. They beat Abington, Cohasset, and Rockland and bumped their record to 8-2-1. On the bubble: Hingham, Plymouth North, Rockland Player of the Week: Rachel Bailey (Norwell) - The junior goalkeeper had a fantastic week for the Clippers in the one match she played. Bailey made a career-high 15 saves in a 1-0 win over previously unbeaten and defending state champs East Bridgewater.
