That was it for Volquez but the damage was done.\nOne out later Troy Tulowitzki would clear the bases with his double to the gap in left centre and that was all she wrote.\nSo, two Game 5s and two gift-wrapped innings for the Jays, who to their credit, took full advantage.\nNOW HEAR THIS\nA round of applause should be extended to the fans who have packed Rogers Centre for six games in the post-season. They have been loud and raucous and have provided the Jays with full-blown support.\nThey were especially loud during the top of the sixth when Volquez was melting down just like Johnny Cueto in Game 3.\nThe crowd was so loud it interfered in the decision making of Rangers manager Ned Yost on whether or not Jose Bautista had a check swing that was called a ball.\n“I thought the pitch to Bautista was definitely a strike,” Yost said. “And I thought we had a chance on him swinging, but we couldn’t get anybody’s attention on it. And the one to Encarnacion probably could have gone either way, we just didn’t get the call there.”\nNeither did they get any kind of discussion from Royals catcher Salvador Perez.\n“Sal wasn’t trying to appeal for it. It was too loud for me to hear what they were talking about,” Yost said. “I’m not a mind reader, I don’t know what they were talking about.\n“We were trying to get their attention to get him to appeal it. I don’t know if he was arguing the pitch, I don’t know what he was talking about.”\nTEAM ON A MISSION\nIn the opening four games the Royals were simply the better team, period, end of story and that’s why they had pulled in to a 3-1 lead.\nAll the pre-game chatter seemed to be on how they were a team on a mission, one that was able to elevate their games when it matters most. After Tuesday’s win, it was pitcher Chris Young’s turn to gush over the team dynamic.\n“I think you saw it last year,” Young said. “There’s a comfort level these guys have, where they know this is something special. I don’t know how to explain it, but it really is tremendous. They come to play every day, yet they’re still relaxed. There’s no nerves.\n“Maybe it’s because they trust each other. They know that if they don’t get the job done, the guy behind them will. It’s not just about the baseball talent. It’s about the character of the individuals. I’ve never seen anything like it with a baseball team.”\nFRED AND GINGER\nMuch has been written about how well the combination of Marco Estrada and Dioner Navarro have worked this season. For whatever reason they have meshed and established tremendous chemistry.\n“I don’t know, I just think being around the big leagues for a little bit kind of helped me out,” Navarro said of being able to connect with certain pitchers. “One of the things I try to do when I get to a new team or new teammates, especially as a pitcher, get to know them, try to let them rely on me, and kind of let them put that trust on me, on what I’m capable of.\n“I think the first two starts wasn’t as good as we expected. But we kind of got together and we talked and we developed a great relationship. And I just try to do that with all my guys, honestly.”\nThe game plan going in was a simple one.\n“I think he’s just got to get ahead,” Navarro said before the game. “They’re going to put the ball in play. They don’t strike out much. They’re got to make things happen. So I think if he gets ahead and works ahead on the count he’s going to not make it easier, but is going to give us a better shot of finishing hitters off.”\nBoy did he ever.\nALCS Game 5, Blue Jays vs. Royals\n2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.
