We were No. 2. We started out great, and then when they scored, our heads dropped a little bit. I'd say they have a great shot at winning the whole thing. I'd be surprised if they don't.\"\nWebb (15-3-2) was chasing its first state sectional win, and had never hosted a sectional game prior to Saturday.\nThe Lady Spartans trailed 1-0 at halftime after Lee Ellen Stanley's goal in the 10th minute, but struggled to find any momentum on offense in the second half.\nGraham Sippel and Ally Ellzey pushed ECS' lead to 3-0 with goals in the 44th and 45th minutes, respectively, and Maddie Stolnicki added insurance with an assist from Sippel in the 59th minute.\n\"This game doesn't define our season,\" Webb senior goalie Evey Satterfield said. \"We started from the beginning of the season. We did kickboxing. We went into the weight room for the first time. We really got close as a team, and it showed in our play.\"\nWebb only has three seniors — Satterfield, Cameron Beall and Kathryn Lee — and should have a chance to contend for another sectional berth next season.\n\"We hope to keep going,\" junior Lexi Reeves said. \"A lot of juniors are starters, so we'll have a really strong starting team.\n\"We'll just have to bring up the intensity next season. ... Getting to substate and to state next season is definitely a goal.\"\nChris Thomas covers high school sports.
