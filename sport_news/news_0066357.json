(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) Comments \nHertfordshire, England â€” Buffalo Bills general manager heard Sammy Watkins loud and clear when the second-year wide receiver said he wants the ball more and should be getting 10 targets each game . Whaley also loved hearing that from the player he traded two first-round picks to draft No. 4 overall back in 2014. \n\"I'd rather have him be that way than ducking,\" Whaley said. \nSpeaking to reporters for the first time in the regular season, Whaley said he's fine with Watkins' comments so long as he realizes the expectations that come with them. \n\"That's putting a target on his chest, and he knows that,\" Whaley said. \"When he says something like that, then when it comes his way I expect him to make big plays. I like a confident guy.\" \nWhaley has a vested interest in Watkins getting the ball more as well. That draft-day trade was one of his most noteworthy moves as general manager of the Bills. As Watkins said when he spoke out, if he doesn't get the ball, the whole team looks bad. \n\"It dictates with how the defense attacks us,\" Whaley said. \"Is it a different game when he's still in there? I mean, you never know. But I know this much: When he was in there and he got targeted, he made some plays. That's what you signed up for.\" \nFor now, Watkins won't be making any big plays. He's already been ruled out of the Bills' game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London with an ankle injury he suffered in Week 6. It will be the third game this season Watkins hasn't suited up, and it's now the second year in a row he's battled injuries. \n\"It's one of those things where we're going to look at it after the year, but it is what it is,\" Whaley said. \"Unfortunately, injuries are part of the game everywhere. It would be different if we saw an injury history in college, but he was never injured in college. So it's just one of those things where it's that type of year. Some years we don't have any injuries, other years we've just had a rash. This is one of those years, we've just had a rash.\" \nWhen Watkins does return, the expectations have been made perfectly clear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:19:53.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
