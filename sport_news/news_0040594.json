Prosecutors had called for an 18-month prison sentence for Messi's father only, along with a fine of 2 million euros (US$2.2 million). \nThe company managing Messi's image rights, Leo Messi Management, defended the player, saying he had already been cleared by prosecutors. \nBarcelona also released a statement expressing its \"surprise at the difference in criteria\" between the decisions by prosecutors and the state attorney's office. \n\"Barcelona has expressed its affection and solidarity to Leo Messi and his family in such a peculiar situation,\" the statement added. \"The club shall continue to offer him and his family its full support and assistance in the legal, fiscal and administrative aspects of these proceedings.\" \nA court had recently rejected an appeal filed by Messi's lawyers to drop the Barcelona player from the case. Things seemed to be going Messi's way after prosecutors this week announced their request to clear him of any irregularities, but the judge ruled Thursday there was enough evidence of crimes committed by both Messi and his father. \nThey are being accused of defrauding Spain's tax office of 4.1 million euros (US$4.6 million) in unpaid taxes from 2007-09.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:03:46.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
