She was dominant. \nWhat it means: Northwestern looks ready to battle Central Catholic at the District 11 Class AA meet. Riefenstahl, meanwhile, looks like she could be the next great Saucon Valley track/cross country runner after Alyssa Lombardo and Elizabeth Chikotas. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
