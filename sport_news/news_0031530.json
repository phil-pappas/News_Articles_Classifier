(AP) - Authorities say the fatal beating of a young man and the savage attack on his younger brother by relatives and fellow members of an upstate New York church was intended to get them to confess their sins, but they still haven't determined what those supposed sins were.\nInvestigators say spiritual \"counseling\" at the Word of Life church in New Hartford became an hours-long attack Sunday in which 19-year-old Lucas Leonard and his 17-year-old brother, Christopher, were pummeled with fists and kicked. Lucas Leonard died at a hospital. His brother remained hospitalized Wednesday in serious condition.\nTheir parents, Bruce and Deborah Leonard, were charged with manslaughter in Lucas' death. Four other adults were charged with assault in the younger brother's beating, including the victims' sister.\nAll the suspects pleaded not guilty.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:54:45.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
