FSU's Johnathan Vickers will go from role player to feature back against Miami if Dalvin Cook cannot go. \nTALLAHASSEE – Johnathan Vickers does a little bit of everything for FSU. \nThe sophomore running back is a steady runner, a competent receiver out of the backfield and a willing blocker. He will gladly shift to fullback on occasions and contributes on various special teams units. \nHe is the jack-of-all trades for the Seminoles. But of his wide array of useful skills, none will serve Vickers better than his best attribute; his patience. \nVickers patiently waited his turn behind FSU’s talented duo of Dalvin Cook and Mario Pender, doing whatever he could in the meantime to help the Seminoles. Pender is out for the foreseeable future due to complications from a collapsed lung and Cook is questionable due to a hamstring injury. That means No. 12 FSU (4-0, 2-0 ACC) will turn to the untested Vickers against rival Miami (3-1) at 8 p.m. Saturday. \n“When the time comes, we have to step up and do our job,” Vickers said. “We don’t consider ourselves as [backups] because at any time you can be a [starter.] You always have to prepare as you’re a one. \n“But of course this is a big moment. If you don’t do your job, you get fired.” \nSaturday has the potential to be intimidating for a player like Vickers. With just 11 carries in his career – 10 of which came against Wake Forest last week following Cook’s injury – Vickers does not know what it means to be a featured back on this level. \nHowever, that doesn’t mean he isn’t capable of handling that burden. \n“There’s a tremendous talent level there,” coach Jimbo Fisher said. “Tremendous size, speed, intelligence. I think the guy can be one heck of a football player. I’ve said that from Day 1. He can do anything. When he makes his mind up, he can do anything he wants to do.” \nVickers was a three-star recruit (out of five stars) – according to 247Sports.com’s composite rankings – coming out of high school at Tallahassee North Florida Christian. Teams like Alabama and Clemson caught on and offered Vickers a scholarship when he was a sophomore leading the Eagles to a state championship, but he fell off the radar for most recruiting pundits when he broke his leg as a junior. \nA rod was inserted into Vickers’ leg to fix the break on the August night he suffered the injury and he was back playing baseball for NFC by January. The quick recovery, according to Vickers’ high school coach Robert Craft, was telling of the back’s work ethic and ability to persevere. \n“He has this goal in mind that he doesn’t want things – whether it’s people in front of him or adversity – get in the way,” Craft said. “When you do the right things, eventually your opportunity is going to come.” \nCraft said Vickers was 4.0 student in school. He was the senior-class president, a member of the National Honor Society and a starter on the baseball team. That balance prepared him well for acclimating to college. \nTeammates and Fisher spoke highly of Vickers last spring and through preseason camp, insisting he was not far behind proven runners Cook and Pender. Fisher went as far to say that Vickers – at 6-foot-1, 226 pounds – had the potential to be an NFL back. \nIt was not necessarily a breakout performance, but Vickers flashed his potential against Wake Forest. He ran for 33 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries, displaying a promising blend of quickness and power. There were a couple runs during which Vickers was frustrated with himself after missing a cut or not allowing blocks to set up, serving as a reminder why he needs to keep remaining patient on Saturday. \n“I’m not worried about the run game because I know Johnathan Vickers, he had a very good performance on Saturday,” left tackle Rod Johnson said. “I don’t think he’s undersized, but he probably plays like he’s undersized. He’s trying to make a statement out there; he’s trying to let his presence be known and that’s what he’s doing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:41:46.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
