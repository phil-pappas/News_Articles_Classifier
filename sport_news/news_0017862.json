We're adjusting the timing and the way the voting takes place.\" \nEngland 2015 managing director Stephen Brown and World Rugby boss Brett Gosper offered slightly different views on England's World Cup disappointment, although both felt the tournament would continue to be a success. \nIt is the first time a host nation will be missing from the quarter-finals, but, with the event already acclaimed the biggest and best in its history, it is felt their absence will not impact on interest levels in the final weeks. \n\"With the tournament being in full swing and proving a juggernaut with huge success and momentum, there has been very little effect, if any, on the global nature of the tournament,\" Gosper said. \n\"All tournaments would like the hosts to do well enough to keep momentum going in the host country, but my sense is this is a very mature and philosophical sporting market. \n\"England may be out but the people here still love their sport and love the event. The spirit of English fans will still contribute to making this tournament a success. We're fine.\" \nBrown, the Rugby Football Union's financial director, was less sanguine over the departure of Stuart Lancaster's men. \n\"There is no question that we are disappointed that England, the host nation, are not involved in the knockout phase. I don't think we can shy away from that,\" Brown said. \n\"That is a challenge. We were always ready for 12 teams going home after the pool phases. We always knew that one big nation was going to go out of the Pool A.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:00:30.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
