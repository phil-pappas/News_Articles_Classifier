He can bench-press 310 pounds, squat 550, and power-clean 300.\nBut the Neshaminy two-way lineman concentrated on more than adding muscle in the offseason. He also worked on his speed and agility at a facility in Lower Bucks County.\n\"I really wanted to get quicker and improve my footwork,\" said Kelly, a senior captain and third-year starter.\nWith the 6-foot-3, 285-pounder a force at offensive tackle, the Redskins are 3-1 and averaging an impressive 254.4 rushing yards per game.\n\"Hunter has been playing at a consistently high level,\" Neshaminy first-year coach Steve Wilmot said. \"He switched from quick-side tackle to tight end [in a 27-25 win over Council Rock South] to give us an advantage against a stingy defense. He'll play anywhere to help the team.\"\nIn a Suburban One League National Conference opener Monday night at Abington, Neshaminy racked up 385 rushing yards and seven touchdowns on 53 attempts en route to a 47-7 romp at Schwarzman Stadium. On 31 first-half tries, they netted 288 yards and five scores.\n\"We've really been coming together on offense,\" Kelly said. \"This showed what we're capable of doing when we're clicking on all cylinders.\"\nTailback Will Dogba carried 13 times for 148 yards and two TDs as the visitors built a 34-7 halftime advantage. For the season, the speedy junior has rushed 108 times for 570 yards and eight TDs.\nQuarterback Mason Jones, who broke free for a 55-yard TD in the second quarter, has netted 256 yards and two touchdowns on 31 attempts. Halfback Joe Pirrone (19 carries for 78 yards and a TD vs. Abington) and fullback Hayden Rooney are also threats.\nJones has completed 35 of 65 passes for 502 yards and three TDs. His main targets are wideouts Denzel Hughes (11 catches for 139 yards, two TDs) and Zach Tredway (11 for 240, one TD).\nKelly, who also sees time at defensive tackle, is joined on the line by fellow tackle Chris Wilson (6-5, 290), center A.J. Sanko (5-8, 205), guards Eddie Parry (6-0, 285) and Parker Minotti (6-4, 225), and end Billy Ritchey (6-2, 235).\nWilmot took over for Mike Frederick, who stepped away after going 4-6 in his one season. Wilmot was a Redskins assistant for two decades.\n\"Since he's been around for so long, he knows all the players real well,\" said Kelly, whose father, Dan, works with Neshaminy's kickers. \"The players easily mesh with him. That's a huge positive.\"\nThe defensive headliners for the Redskins, who host Pennridge (2-2 overall, 0-1 conference) at 6 p.m. Saturday, are linebackers Daulton Fox (23 tackles), Jack Spingler (21), and Kyle Smith (17). Harmon Yalartai (14) has shined at end.\nKelly, a second-team all-conference pick last season, has yet to receive a scholarship offer. He plans to visit Delaware on Oct. 17. At the Division II level, Kutztown is a possibility.\nMajor loss. Haverford School lost senior QB Kevin Carter to a season-ending knee injury in a 35-13 win over West Catholic on Sept. 18. In three outings, he converted 51 of 70 passes (72.9 percent) for 752 and nine TDs.\n\"He's a captain, worked hard, was a great team guy,\" Fords coach Mike Murphy said. \"Losing him has had a major impact on our team.\"\nJunior Tommy Toal, who was a slot receiver, has replaced Carter. \"He's a good athlete, a Division I recruit [as a third baseman] in baseball,\" Murphy said. \"He wasn't overwhelmed by the situation when he came in against West Catholic.\"\nNotes. For Marple Newtown, off to a 4-0 start for the first time since 2007, Abel Hoff has 25 catches for 364 yards and five TDs. . . . Father Judge will honor its 1975 city title team -the Crusaders edged Frankford, 9-6, at Veterans Stadium - when it plays Roman Catholic on Oct. 17 at Northeast. . . . Jenkintown's Steve Charlemagne has carried 56 times for 472 yards and four TDs. . . . Chester's Nahmir Ishmail has thrown for 423 yards and four TDs. . . . Upper Moreland's Rodney Morgan has carried 87 times for 644 yards and six TDs.\nrobrien@phillynews.com\n@ozoneinq\nwww.philly.com/ozone", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:51:37.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
