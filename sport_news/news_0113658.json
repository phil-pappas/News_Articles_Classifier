There’s still an entire season to play before Nevada gets there, but couple the transfers Nevada added this season who are eligible next year (Marcus Marshall, Jordan Caroline, Sam Williams and Leland King) and the recruits who have committed to play for the Wolf Pack next season (four-star recruits Devearl Ramsey, Josh Hall and Arlando Cook among them) and toss in two high-caliber freshmen who joined the team this season (Lindsey Drew and Cameron Oliver, both Pac-12 commits initially) and Wolf Pack fans must be drooling. \n* THAT ROSTER LOOKS INCREDIBLY loaded and exceptionally deep. It’s enough to get Nevada fans to dream about the Big Dance again. But, the first order of business is this season, a year that hopefully for Wolf Pack fans looks nothing like last season’s nine-win campaign. This year’s roster is a mirror image of last year’s minus a couple of small changes (Mike Perez and Stelios Papafloratos out and Drew and Oliver in). If Nevada is going to be successful this year, it will have to do so with the same players who struggled last year, guys like D.J. Fenner, Marqueze Coleman, Eric Cooper, Lucas Stivrins, Tyron Criswell and AJ West. The deep future looks bright, but what about the near future? What about this year? Picking the 25 Legends of Wolf Pack athletics \n* THE WOLF PACK WAS PICKED to finish ninth out of 11 teams in the preseason Mountain West media poll released this week (for the record I had Nevada seventh on my ballot). That’s a fair expectation. This roster still has shooting issues and unless Nevada plays great defense and gets into transition those shooting issues will limit this team’s ceiling. What is a good season for Nevada in 2015-16? A winning record. What is a great season for Nevada? A postseason berth, which would be Nevada’s first since 2012. \n* WHILE IT’S EASY FOR WOLF PACK fans to want to move ahead to next season when the talent level takes a big step forward (but so does the inexperience), this year is all about building a foundation and trying to make sure seniors like Coleman, Stivrins, Criswell and West go out with a season they can be proud of. It also will show us how well the current staff can develop college-aged talent as the pure athletic skill on the current roster isn’t bad but the basketball skill and IQ needs to be developed. If Nevada finishes in the top half of the MW, you’d have to consider that a step in the right direction. The season after that? Wolf Pack fans can aim for the moon given the talent that’s coming into the program. \n* THE OLD BALL COACH hung up his whistle this week, if only temporarily, and while most of the stories on Steve Spurrier resigning from South Carolina were positive, it’s hard to not look at him as a quitter, plain and simple. Would he have resigned if his team was 4-2 instead of 2-4? No. How would the stories read if a quarterback quit on his team in a time of trouble? Not nearly so positive. Spurrier, who made it clear he was resigning and not retiring (maybe a better opportunity will come along), did a great job at South Carolina. He made an irrelevant program matter in the SEC. He’s a great coach and a great quote. But he should have held on until the end of the year. He took the easy way out and quit on his players. \n* USC FIRED STEVE SARKISIAN this week. It really had no choice. A guy struggling with alcoholism can’t lead a college football team. Who’s going to send their son to play for that coach? It’s the best for Sarkisian, too. He can focus on simply getting healthy and not rushing back. But how does AD Pat Haden still have a job? He’s whiffed on his two most high-profile hires – Sarkisian and basketball coach Andy Enfield – and was fined by the Pac-12 for inappropriate sideline conduct after confronting officials during a 2014 game. He’s let USC’s Rolls Royce of a football program be mired in disarray for three seasons. He clearly didn’t do his homework on Sarkisian, who had issues dating back to Washington. I’m not a fan of stumping for people getting fired, but Haden’s building a case against himself. \n* IN THE WAKE OF ONE OF the most bizarre innings in MLB history – the seventh inning of Game 5 of the Toronto-Texas ALDS – the big headline was Jose Bautista’s bat flip heard round the world (aka BatFlipGate). Old-school baseball fans hated the bat flip even though there’s plenty of evidence of bat flips in the 1970s and 1980s ( did you ever seen Rickey Henderson after a homer? ). I’m all for exuberance in baseball. Here’s the thing I don’t get. Fans were upset when the NFL cracked down on touchdown celebrations. So, we like our celebrations in football but we hate them in baseball? That doesn’t make sense. In the end, the pitcher controls the bat flip: Don’t allow a homer and the batter won’t flip his bat. \n* SOMEBODY WITH THE VANCOUVER CANUCKS is a genius. The NHL team will allow players to pick a song that plays after they score a goal like MLB teams allow players walk-up music for their at-bats. This should be applied to all jobs. A pizza-delivery guy gets the pie to your house in 15 minutes and Bon Jovi’s “Wanted Dead or Alive” blares from his car. A CFO finishes the fiscal year with a profit and U2’s “Where the Streets Have No Names” buzzes through the office. A teacher leads a class to all As and Bs and Katy Perry’s “Roar” rings out on the final day of school. In fact, I feel this was a pretty good article. Not my best, but worthy of a celebration song. Imagine Pearl Jam’s “State of Love and Trust” playing right now. \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
