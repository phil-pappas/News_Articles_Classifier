FRANK BELLINO, FILE PHOTO Related article » IF YOU GO What: The Eastvale City Council will discuss its negotiations with Riverside County on Senate Bill 107.\nWhen: Monday, Oct. 5, 5:30 p.m.\nWhere: Eastvale City Hall, 12363 Limonite Ave., Suite 910\nInformation: 951-361-0900\nJurupa Valley’s jubilation over seeing its $22 million debt to Riverside County wiped out by a new bill – with a one-time infusion of $23.7 million in state money – may have been premature.\nOfficials from Eastvale, Menifee and Wildomar have all sent letters to their respective Riverside County supervisors seeking forgiveness of roughly $8 million the cities say they owe Riverside County for public safety and other services.\nOn Thursday, Oct. 1, the fifth anniversary of its incorporation, Eastvale sent a letter to Supervisor John Tavaglione, whose Second District includes Eastvale and Jurupa Valley, asking Riverside County to erase its debt of $5 million it says it owes Riverside County. A summary attached to the letter shows pending county invoices for fire protection, law enforcement and animal services.\nEastvale City Manager Michele Nissen said she decided within the past several months to stop paying some of Riverside County’s bills to make a statement: that Senate Bill 107 benefited one city – Jurupa Valley – to the detriment of the others.\n“There needs to be a fair and equitable solution for all the cities, not just one,” Nissen said.\nIvan Chand, a deputy county executive officer for Riverside County, said the county counsel’s office was reviewing the letters and would determine how the money would be distributed.\nJurupa Valley’s top administrator isn’t worried.\n“I don’t really care about the other cities or what they submitted,” Jurupa Valley City Manager Gary Thompson said. “We’re confident that the full amount that we have requested will be paid.”\nEastvale officials will meet with Tavaglione on Monday, Oct. 5, at 10 a.m., she said. A special city council meeting is set for 5:30 p.m. at Eastvale City Hall, 12363 Limonite Ave., Suite 910. The council plans to discuss its negotiations on the issue with the county.\nIn 2011, Eastvale, Menifee, Jurupa Valley and Wildomar – the state’s newest cities – were staggered by the loss of millions of dollars in state revenue after the California legislature voted to move vehicle-license fee revenue from cities to law enforcement grants.\nJurupa Valley, which became a city two days after the shift, was teetering on the brink of insolvency but was saved when Riverside County agreed to delay payment of millions of dollars the city owed for helping it transition to cityhood, its Riverrside County Sheriff’s Department contract and revenue neutrality payments.\nWith interest, Jurupa Valley owes Riverside County about $22 million.\nGov. Jerry Brown vetoed three bills that would have restored the funding to the four cities, but this year signed SB 107.\nThe new bill will pay $23.7 million that Riverside County owes to Cal Fire for firefighting services, provided that the county forgives the debt owed by Jurupa Valley, Eastvale, Menifee and Wildomar.\nMenifee Mayor Scott Mann has said that the state must address the long-term problem by replacing the license fee money the city counted on when it incorporated in 2008. That amounts to about $4 million a year.\nThe city had made arrangements to pay the county about $100,000 a year to cover incorporation debt, Mann said, that will now be forgiven under SB 107.\n“All the debt relief does is improve cash flow by $100,000 (per year),” Mann said. “Here’s the analogy: that doesn’t even pay for one ... traffic light.”\nWildomar’s letter, sent Sept. 23 to Supervisor Marion Ashley seeks about $2 million in debt relief stemming from $1.5 million the city owes for transition year costs and $494,913 in delinquent payments for fire protection.\nStaff writer Tom Sheridan contributed to this report.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9647 or sstokley@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmkf2-b88530366z.120151002202819000g4vccffc.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmkf1-b88530366z.120151002202819000gh5ccgfl.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmkf2-b88530366z.120151002202819000g4vccffc.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmkf1-b88530366z.120151002202819000gh5ccgfj.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmkf2-b88530366z.120151002202819000gsgccght.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmkf1-b88530366z.120151002202819000gh5ccgfj.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmkf1-b88530366z.120151002202819000gh5ccgfl.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmkf2-b88530366z.120151002202819000gsgccght.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:11:04.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
