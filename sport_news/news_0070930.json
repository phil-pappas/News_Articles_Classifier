Though the festival is a few days away, the administration and police officials are not taking any chances. Deputy Commissioner (DC) Abhinav Trikha and SSP Gurpreet Singh Toor are trying to defuse the situation by talking to the concerned stakeholders. Meetings between administration officials and both the warring factions are being held regularly but no solution seems to be in sight. The genesis of the problem lies in the estranged relationship between the MLA and the BJP. During the last assembly elections, the BJP had reluctantly extended support to him. Later, fissures surfaced in the open when the MLA managed to appoint one his loyalists as the president of the Municipal Committee, much to the chagrin of the BJP. The Dasehra organising committee, which has a strong presence of BJP workers, has decided to keep the MLA at bay. The committee’s invitation card names senior BJP leader Ashok Vaid as the chief guest and real estate developer Manjit Singh Dala and advocate Inderjit Sharma as guests of honour. Gurdaspur BJP president Romesh Sharma said, “No invite will be sent to Babbehali as last year, he came after the Ravana’s effigy was set afire, a development which is considered to be inauspicious.” This is also the official explanation being given by the committee members although the fact is that the MLA is being given the cold shoulder owing to his differences with the local BJP leaders. This development has infuriated SAD workers in general and Babbehali in particular. SAD workers are seeing this as a “clear attempt to erode the credibility” of their leader. Interestingly, one of his supporters, Kishan Bamhotra, has pushed into circulation hundreds of invitation cards on which the MLA’s name has been printed as the chief guest. Neither the BJP nor the MLA is willing to back out, following which the district administration has gone into an overdrive to find an amicable solution. President of the organising committee and BJP leader Hardeep Singh Riar said the body formed by Kishen Bamhotra was “illegal and unconstitutional” in nature. He claimed that only his body was a registered one, following which the administration officials should accord recognition to it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:09:32.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
