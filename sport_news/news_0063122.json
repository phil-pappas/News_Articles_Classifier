He was 69.\nEverton said Kendall died in hospital in Southport, northwestern England, on Saturday. The club did not give a cause of death.\nKendall first took charge of Everton from 1981-87, winning the English league title and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, and the league again in 1987. It was the most successful period in the club's history.\nHe also managed Everton from 1990-93 and for the 1997-98 season, having previously spent seven years of his playing career at the club.\n\"It is with great sadness that Everton Football Club has learned of the passing of Howard Kendall,\" an Everton club statement said. \"The most successful manager in the history of the club and one of the greatest players to pull on the Everton jersey, he passed away in hospital in Southport this morning at the age of 69, surrounded by loved ones.\"\nAs well as managing Everton, Kendall also took control of Blackburn, Spanish side Athletic Bilbao, Manchester City, Notts County, Sheffield United and Greek sides Xanthi and Ethnikos Piraeus.\nBut it was at Everton — specifically during his first tenure as manager — where he achieved the most success, often battling against fierce local rival Liverpool for silverware.\nAs a player, Kendall was considered one of the best never to play for England.\nTogether with Alan Ball and Colin Harvey at Everton, he formed a three-man midfield partnership which was nicknamed 'the holy trinity' for its contribution to winning the league title in 1970.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
