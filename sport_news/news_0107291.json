There is still a lot of hockey to be played and we believe this change was necessary to give our team the best chance to accomplish the goals we've set for this season.\" \nThe Blue Jackets, who lost 4-0 at home to the New York Islanders on Tuesday night, plan to retain assistant coaches Craig Hartsburg and Brad Larsen, according to TSN. \nRichards, 49, was 127-112-21 with the Blue Jackets after taking over midway through the 2011-12 season.
