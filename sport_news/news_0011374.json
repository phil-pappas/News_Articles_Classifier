That's what Big Blue Madness is all about, after all, and not the annual unveiling of Kentucky basketball's new team in its first public practice. \nCalipari, surrounded by about $300,000 worth of stage and screen and smoke and lasers, might never have sold the program better than in this one. His speech, which has become something of a State of the Union address each year at Madness, was pure pitch. \nAfter rapper Drake, who attended this event last year, introduced his pal Calipari – \"the most luxurious coach in NCAA basketball\" – on a pre-recorded video, the coach focused on the program's past, present and future. \nKentucky unveiled its 2015 Final Four banner (the Wildcats' 17th) in the rafters and surrounded it with laser light in case anyone missed it. Calipari reminded those in attendance that no one has been to more national semifinals (or won more games) since he came to town. \nThe Cats turned their court into a giant projection screen, which flashed highlights and new and old and screamed to recruits in the building: \"WHO WANTS TO BE NEXT?\" \nAs Calipari spoke, a screech went up in one corner of the darkened arena. Former Wildcats stars Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins and Willie Cauley-Stein – all recent top-10 draft picks who are in town for Saturday's NBA exhibition – had just walked in and fans went wild. The timing was not coincidental, rather clearly choreographed. \nStory continues after the gallery Buy Photo Players take photos with fans during the University of Kentucky Big Blue Madness at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Ky., on Friday, October 16, 2015.
