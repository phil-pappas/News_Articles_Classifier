Baylor’s Offensive Line Makes Joe Moore Award Honor Roll Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK – Baylor football’s offensive line was named to the second quarterly Joe Moore Award Honor Roll as announced by The Joe Moore Foundation for Teamwork Wednesday. \nThe honor roll identifies notable performances by offensive line units in games played through October 10. \nThe starters on Baylor’s offensive line all have 14 or more career starts (Spencer Drango 41, Kyle Fuller 19, Blake Muir 18, Jarell Broxton 14, Pat Colbert 14). In 2015, the Bears are ranked second in the Big 12 and 11th in the nation by giving up just six sacks in six games. The veteran group has also helped BU become the nation’s No. 2 rushing offense with 348.7 yards per game and the No. 1 offense (719.7 ypg). \nThe Joe Moore Award Honor Roll includes units that display a high level of toughness, effort, teamwork, physicality, tone setting and finishing. Statistics, including those supplied by the universities (i.e. knockdowns), are used to support observations made about the technique and effort displayed in the game film. Semifinalists for the Joe Moore Award will be announced on Nov. 16, with five finalists determined by Nov. 30. The Joe Moore Award winning unit will be announced after the conclusion of the regular season. \nKeep up with the Bears all season long by following @BUFootball on Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat.
