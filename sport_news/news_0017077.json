The former North Quincy High wrestler steps into the ring Saturday night in the 10-round main event at the Sportsplex at Marina Bay in Quincy against Gary Tapusoa, on the top of a nine-bout card he’s also promoting. Traietti, 18-3, has enjoyed a run of eight straight victories since returning to his hometown area, and he has an interesting opponent in Tapusoa, 7-4-1, who hails from Independence, Missouri. Tapusoa is a 5-8 fireplug with a potent punch. While he lost three of his previous four bouts, his three opponents had an aggregate record of 35-6, and Tapusoa got back on track June 12 with a first-round knockout of Kyle Seever. The Traietti-Tapusoa bout also has the World Boxing Council’s U.S. title belt on the line, with the two cruiserweights fighting for that vacant national championship. Getting into the ring is where Traietti, 30, wants to be, and it’s all the other stuff that it takes to get him there that is most taxing. Traietti had planned for this show to be at the Dorchester Armory, where he’s run pro boxing cards before. But he learned late in the preparation for the show that a state directive has instructed the various armories that no private rentals will be allowed. Traietti needed a venue and the sooner the better. Last June, problems with staging a show at the Quincy Armory led to a hastily re-scheduled card that Traietti admits ended up as a disappointment, with too few bouts and not many competitive ones. He knows that local fans will be wary if this card and future efforts are not top-notch. “Last June, with the venue change in the last week, was just a fiasco,” said Traietti, on a break from his day job as a security officer. “Fights were falling out at the last minute, and we were jumping through hoops to be able to just put on the show. That memory is why I’m really committed to making this one, and our next card in November, work. We need to knock it out of the park with these shows just to restore our credibility with local fans.” Faced with the loss of the Dorchester venue, Traietti was discussing his problem with his friend Gerry Hanley, owner of Paddy Barry’s Pub. Hanley is a close friend with the SportsPlex owners, and so pointed the boxer toward that venue, where that ill-fated June show had ended up. “The people at the SportsPlex are truly great guys,” said Traietti. “They have made this transition so easy, and it’s a natural place for our local fan base to go to, and it has plenty of free parking all around it. We’ve got nine fights lined up, and I really believe this is going to be the best card I’ve ever promoted.” Page 2 of 2 - Along with Traietti’s headlining 10-rounder, the card will include Quincy heavyweight Nick Cyr, a partner in the Cyr-Farrell Boxing Gym that was formerly on Hancock Street, facing Brockton’s Huston Crayton in a four-rounder. Cyr, 2-1 as a pro, hasn’t fought since losing in Washington, D.C., in February 2014, and he’ll have a good test in the well-traveled Crayton. Dorchester’s Gabriel Duluc, 9-1, meets Brooklyn’s Ian Jams in a welterweight four-rounder. One of the hottest young prospects at Traietti’s home gym, which is now the Grealish Gym in Dorchester, is Saugus native Brandon Montella. “Brandon is a former Marine who has been training with Jimmy Farrell Jr., so I know him very well,” said Traietti. “He won his pro debut, on that June 27 show, and he’s eager to start moving through the light-heavyweight ranks.” Montella meets Philadelphia’s Greg Thomas in a four-rounder. A six-round bout at 140 pounds pits New York City’s Wellington Arias Rosario, 7-0-1, against Rameses Gil, 9-12-5. New Haven, C onn., middleweight David Wilson, 5-0, meets Brockton trialhorse Antonio Chaves Fernandez in another six. Traietti has also reached out beyond New England to find more talent for the show. He’s forged an alliance with Jay Z’s Rock Nation promotional arm to bring some of their young talent to Quincy. “Rock Nation is bringing up a former member of the Dominican Republic Olympic team (Arias Rosario), and two Chinese Olympians,” said Traietti. “So this card is a kind of a local who’s who of boxers, and also a chance to see some up-and-coming national prospects.” The two Chinese Olympic vets are Fanlong Meng, 3-0 as a light-heavyweight, and Zhimin Wang, 4-0 as a junior-welterweight. New Jersey’s Dustin Fleischer, 4-0 with four knockouts, is also slated for welterweight action. Due to the length of the card, the doors will open at 6:30 p.m., with the first bout slated to go on around 6:45 p.m. Tickets are available online with a special promotional price of $15 at www.ticketriver.com (look for the SportsPlex name), and will also be available at the door at $30.
