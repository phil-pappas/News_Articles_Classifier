Storylines galore? Look at college QBs in state of Utah USA Today released a list of Division I football head coaches ranked by their per year salaries Thursday, and there were no surprises who tops the list.\nAlabama’s Nick Saban is football royalty in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and besides Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh ($7,004,000), he makes the most out of any head coach in America by more than $1 million at $7,087,481.\nThirty-nine spots lower at No. 40, you’ll find Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham, who will rake in $2.6 million from the U. this season. When comparing Whittingham to his counterparts, his salary sits at No. 7 out of the 11 Pac-12 schools surveyed (USC is private school), a statistic that might change in the coming years if the Utes can continue this early season success.\nTo put everything in perspective, there are 12 SEC head coaches, five Big Ten, five Big 12 coaches and one ACC coach who make more than the highest-paid Pac-12 coach (Washington’s Chris Petersen). Meanwhile, every coach in the SEC whose numbers are available (Vanderbilt is private) makes more than Whittingham, who has his Utah team sitting at No. 5 in The Associated Press Poll.\nIf you’re looking for BYU head coach Bronco Mendenhall’s salary, you won’t find it on this list. Due to BYU being a private institution, those records were not readily available for USA Today.\nUtah State head coach Matt Wells comes in at No. 84 on the list, the eighth-highest salary in the Mountain West, at $750,000.\nTwitter: @GriffDoug", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:48:18.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
