He had it in his first year at Nebraska. \n\"It was the worst,' he said. \"I don't remember that you can die from it and so I think guys are taking it pretty seriously.\" \nAmukamara believes he contracted MRSA when he picked a pimple on his wrist and then had contact with a sweaty strap that a teammate used while weightlifting. The site got itchy and then he got sick. \nThe wrist was drilled and cleaned out, he said. He was in bed for three or four days with a big wrap on his hand. \n\"It's like a very extreme case of the flu,\" Amukamara said of the MRSA effects. \"My body felt like paralyzed. I didn't want to get up and shower. I always felt cold.\" \nHe felt better in a week. \nZak DeOssie, the Giants player representative, said the team has its entire facility disinfected several times during the season and this time, they simply moved up the service a couple of weeks. \n\"It's scary, but I know we are doing everything we possibly can,\" DeOssie said. \"What else can you do? You have to be extra diligent washing your hands, reporting any sort of lesion or anything that feels not right. It's just an unfortunate part of the job. We have to be extra wary as we move forward.\" \nLinebacker Mark Herzlich said his biggest concern was for Fells. \n\"We talked in the hall,\" Herzlich said. \"He is doing better, but he is very sick. Hopefully it was a fluke thing and nothing has to be done besides cleaning up and containing it.\" \nThe doctors and trainers had some surprising facts about MRSA, the biggest one being that it is on 5 to 10 percent of people, Herzlich said. \n\"It doesn't affect a lot of people because their skin protects them,\" he said. \"Unfortunately when there are abrasions or needles, it can get inside.\" \nOffensive lineman John Jerry said it's important that players report either any swelling or fever and get it looked at immediately. \nDespite all the precautions, receiver Odell Beckham Jr. said MRSA sometimes cannot be avoided. \n\"Everybody is sweaty, dirty, and things can get passed around through scabs and scars or whatever,\" he said. \nBeckham did not sound concerned about the infection. \n\"They said something about Ebola a long time ago, and I try not to worry about that,\" the 22-year-old said. \"There's no need to worry about it, if something is going to happen, it's going to happen. I believe in destiny and faith.\" \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:47:42.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
