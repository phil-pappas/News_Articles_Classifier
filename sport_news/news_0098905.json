The Chiefs (1-5) had eight penalties enforced for 95 yards. \nDiggs had 129 yards on seven catches on a day when Bridgewater threw two interceptions. Adrian Peterson, who was on the sideline late in the game with the Vikings trying to put it away, finished with 60 yards on 26 carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:08:17.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
