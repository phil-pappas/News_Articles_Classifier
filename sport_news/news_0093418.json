'I came out and supported my team and they were great. They still made me feel part of things. I still went through thoughts of what if I was out there, maybe I could have helped.' \nEast Coweta head softball coach Franklin DeLoach said his leadoff hitter hasn't missed a step since returning to the lineup in August after as lengthy rehab period. \n'She is just as solid with the glove and bat as she was before she got hurt,' he said. \nAlthough Freeman has put the injury in her rearview mirror, she still has vivid memories of how she was hurt during the travel ball season two summers ago. \n'I was trying to get back to the base and it buckled. It was pretty routine.' she said. 'I could tell as soon as it happened, and the way it sounded. It was bad.' \nSome athletes would have given up and accepted their fate. \nFreeman started her rehabilitation almost immediately after season-ending surgery last year. The Lady Indians' centerfielder had plenty of reasons to get better and back on the softball diamond. \nFreeman verbally committed to Georgia Southern as a junior prior to the injury and didn't want anything to ruin her chances of playing major college softball. \nThe game in some form been a part of Freeman life since she first stepped on the diamond to play T-ball as a 3-year-old. \nAlong the way she has played with several travel ball teams, including most recently, the Georgia Elite. \n'All I could think about was my scholarship,' she said. 'The coaches at Georgia Southern were very supportive through the whole process. I was just kind of nervous. They told me to take my time and get back. I worked extra hard everyday.' \nThe rehab sessions included weight lifting, running and agility drills, but the biggest challenging was working through the pain. \n'Sometimes my knee would get stiff, and it was even harder to get through the drills,' she said. \nHowever, her knee responded quickly to the intense workouts. \n'I think my rehab was faster for me than it is for some people,' she said. 'It is usually six to nine months, but I was back in like five.' \nThe thing that impressed DeLoach the most was the way Freeman worked through the injury. \n'I think what makes Mekhia such a great leader is the way she handled things when she was hurt last year,' he said. 'I have had some kids who got hurt and didn't even want to be out here or around their teammates. Unless she was rehabbing her knee, she was her at practice and she didn't miss a game. She was everybody's biggest fan last year from the dugout. They respected her for that.' \nFreeman tested her knee for the first time in the one-month high summer league and hit a home run against Newnan in her first at-bat in more than a year. \n'It was crazy,' she said. 'I had never hit a home run before, but after that I knew I was well.' \nFreeman resumed her travel ball season before donning her East Coweta for her senior season in August. \nHeading into the state playoffs, East Coweta is ranked No. 3 by MaxPreps in Georgia behind North Gwinnett and No. 3 in the nation among states which play high school softball in the fall. \nFreeman is confident the Lady Indians can make a run. \nEast Coweta needs to win two state playoff series to get to the GHSA Elite 8 Tournament in Columbus. 'Seeing our team in their different roles and how competitive they are has been exciting,' she said. 'We are out here fighting for each other. We are always out here trying to get better. We are just one big family.' More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:42:41.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
