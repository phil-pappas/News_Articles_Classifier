The Godolphin horses have remained in the Spa City since the Saratoga meet closed down on Labor Day.\nGreentree, which Sheikh Mohammed purchased from Houston Texans owner Bob McNair for $17.5 million in 2007, has 106 acres and a one-mile all-weather training track.\n\"We are very confident that he is going to run well,\" McLaughlin said Friday after watching Frosted zip through a four-furlong workout in a time of 47 seconds. \"He is doing everything right.\"\nMcLaughlin rolled the dice after Frosted finished third in the Travers. In the Midsummer Derby, Frosted unexpectedly took on Triple Crown winner American Pharoah from the start. The jockey on Frosted, Jose Lezcano , never had been on board the colt before. He got the mount only an hour before the race because regular rider Joel Rosario was hurt after a spill.\nLezcano thought that was the best way for Frosted to win. The early duel on the front end cooked both horses. American Pharoah finally put away Frosted in the stretch of the Travers, but he couldn't hold off Keen Ice, who won the race by three-quarters of a length.\nAfter the Travers, McLaughlin did something he doesn't normally do. He ran on three weeks' rest. He sent Frosted to the Pennsylvania Derby, and the big gray won the Grade II, $1 million race by a convincing two lengths. He came back to Greentree after the Pennsylvania Derby and has shown the trainer no signs of fatigue. The Classic will be his ninth start of the year.\nJimmy Bell , the president of Darley America, the breeding operation for Sheikh Mohmmed, is the U.S. spokesman for Godolphin. He was at Greentree for the work on Friday, and he was just as impressed as McLaughlin. He thinks Frosted could be sitting on an even bigger race than he ran in the Pennsylvania Derby.\n\"The good news is that he is as good as he can be,\" Bell said. \"The horse continues to impress us mentally and physically.\"\nAll the preparations are over. The resume is complete.\nFrosted has been banging heads with the best 3-year-olds all year. He won the Wood Memorial and was fourth in the Kentucky Derby, second in the Belmont and second in the Jim Dandy .\nNow he heads to Lexington, where McLaughlin was born and raised. And Frosted likely will be no better than fourth choice in the wagering.\nTen horses are going to be entered at Monday's draw at Keeneland. The field also will include the talented mare Beholder and two of the best older horses on the planet in Whitney winner Honor Code and Jockey Club Gold Cup champ Tonalist.\nIt is being called perhaps the deepest field in Classic history.\nMcLaughlin won't argue.\n\"Yes,\" he said with a smile, \"because we're in it!\"\ntwilkin@timesunion.com • 518-454-5415 • @tjwilkin", "external_links": ["http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841047/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841047/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841048/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841048/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841049/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841049/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841047/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841048/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/35/8841049/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:31:55.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
