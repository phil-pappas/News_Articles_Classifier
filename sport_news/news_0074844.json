It is important for him and important for us.” \nBrunel said his players needed to improve in the lineout if they were to have a chance of upsetting Ireland. \n“It is crucial that we win our own ball to be able to play our best,” said Brunel. \n“We didn’t do that in our last two matches against Ireland, when we made 240 tackles in 2014 and 219 in 2015. That can’t happen again.” \nBrunel, though, retains belief his troops can raise their game. \n“I am convinced that we can win, but up until now we haven’t been able to play the rugby that we were expecting.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:37:28.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
