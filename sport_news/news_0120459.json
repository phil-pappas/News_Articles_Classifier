But he was hit, the ball popped free and Watts-Jackson caught it, broke a few tackles in the final yards and made it into the end zone for a famous victory. \nElsewhere, top-ranked Ohio State won comfortably against Pennsylvania State, Baylor made it 19 consecutive home wins by downing West Virginia, and Texas Christian was too good for Iowa State. \nMichigan State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) has won seven of eight in the series against rival Michigan, its best stretch in more than a half-century but needed an extraordinary final play to continue that run. \nThe Wolverines were seconds away from sealing the win after forcing the Spartans to turn the ball over following a failed fourth-down attempt with 1:47 left at its 45. \nThe Spartans used their last timeout after the next snap. Michigan had two and coach Jim Harbaugh used both, including one with 10 seconds left to set up the fateful final punt. \nConnor Cook was 18 of 39 for 328 yards and a touchdown for Michigan State, and Aaron Burbridge had nine receptions for 132 yards. \nOhio State won 38-10 against Penn State, with J.T. Barrett running for two touchdowns in the first half and then taking over full-time at quarterback for Cardale Jones in the third quarter. \nThe Buckeyes (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) may not have a definitive answer at quarterback, but they do possess a 20-game winning streak. Barrett added two fourth-quarter touchdown passes. Jones started, as he has all season, but was only 9 for 15 for 84 yards. \nBaylor's Corey Coleman had three more touchdown catches and the Bears won 62-38 against West Viriginia to extend their home streak. \nColeman matched and then broke the single-season school record for TD catches, his nation-leading 16 coming halfway through the regular season. \nColeman finished with 10 catches for 199 yards, his fourth consecutive game with multiple touchdowns and his seventh in a row with at least 100 yards receiving. He also had catch-and-run plays of 50 and 42 yards without scoring. \nTexas Christian's Trevone Boykin threw for 436 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Horned Frogs past Iowa State 45-21. \nBoykin also had a 3-yard scoring run with 14:36 left which put TCU ahead 38-21. \nUtah's Travis Wilson threw for 297 yards and two touchdowns and the Utes held off Arizona State 34-18 to remain the lone undefeated team in the Pac-12 conference. \nUtah won despite a poor performance by special teams. They gave up a 100-yard kickoff return in the first quarter and a 48-yard punt return soon after which resulted in a field goal that put the Sun Devils ahead. \nClemson's Deshaun Watson threw for three touchdowns and a season-best 420 yards to lead the Tigers to a 34-17 win against Boston College and its top-ranked defense. \nWatson added a rushing touchdown and the Tigers improved to 6-0 (3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). Watson finished 27 of 41. \nLouisiana State's Leonard Fournette ran for 180 yards and two touchdowns in a 35-28 win, with the only score in the second-half being a 16-yard touchdown run by the Tigers' kicker Trent Domingue on a faked field goal in the fourth quarter. \nAlabama's Derrick Henry ran for a career-high 236 yards and two scores and the Crimson Tide added a team-record three touchdowns on interception returns in beating Texas A&M 41-23.
