Sabathia announces he will leave the team to enter alcohol rehab.\nThe former Cy Young Award-winning pitcher released a statement: \"I love baseball and I love my teammates like brothers, and I am also fully aware that I am leaving at a time when we should all be coming together for one last push toward the World Series,” Sabathia's statement said. “It hurts me deeply to do this now, but I owe it to myself and to my family to get myself right. I want to take control of my disease, and I want to be a better man, father and player.”\nThe 35-year old approached Yankees manager Joe Girardi with the news before Sunday's game. Yankees officials say they had no idea this was coming.\nTeam officials say they are supporting Sabathia's decision.\nIt comes on the eve of their one-game Wildcard playoff with Houston.\nThe winner of the game will play the Royals in the ALDS.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
