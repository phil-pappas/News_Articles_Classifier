Christian Matau worked his way into East Carolina’s starting lineup at right guard last Saturday against Virginia Tech. After a rocky three seasons on the Pirates’ roster, the 6-foot-3, 334-pound New Bern native made his first college start in their 35-28 win. “He’s earned it at practice and in the game and he’s continued to earn it,” said McNeill, ECU’s sixth-year head coach. “Christian’s done a good job of earning playing time.” Matau, a redshirt sophomore, hurt his right knee during his senior season at New Bern High in 2012, and that caused him to use a redshirt year at ECU in 2013. Before last season started, he injured his other knee. So when Matau got the nod to start last week’s game, it was a special moment. “I told my parents and they were so proud of me. It’s been a long process,” Matau said. “Just stepping in as a starter and hearing my name called out was overwhelming, but at the same time, it’s just the beginning.” Matau learned he was going to start at right guard earlier in the week, and the Pirates’ offensive line went on to pave the way for the offense to gain 410 yards, and quarterback James Summers rushed for 169 yards. “Once he told me, I was focused in and locked in on trying to watch extra film and learn my opponent and just doing everything I could to prepare for the game,” Matau said. Matau admitted to being nervous before the game, but calmed down as it went on. “I was a little bit nervous but I thought I did alright,” he said. “Obviously there’s always something to work on. I’ve been watching extra film on it and seeing what I can improve on.” Matau is listed on this week’s depth chart against SMU as starter at right guard and as the backup center and left guard. Still, he knows his starting position isn’t safe. He said he is always working on improving some aspect of his game. “(McNeill) always talks about, ‘don’t count your reps, make your reps count.’ I feel like I did a good job of doing that,” Matau said. “I have to keep on working and come to practice with an agenda. “They always say you are always one play away from not being a starter. I know there is somebody behind me that is working just as hard as me. That makes me work harder.” Page 2 of 2 - East Carolina plays in Dallas at SMU at 4 p.m. on Saturday. The game will be televised on ESPNNews. Adam Thompson is the sports editor at the Sun Journal. He can be contacted at 252-635-5669.
