(Photo: Brian Miller/Democrat) Buy Photo Wakulla's 15-6 win over Godby keeps the War Eagles firmly atop the power rankings Chiles continues to move up, after yet another win, this time over Lincoln NFC and Florida High battle this week among middle-ranked teams Lincoln dropped out of the rankings after a loss that left the Trojans at 1-5 on the season 38 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLast week was probably the most exciting one of the season with down-to-the-wire finishes for some very important district games. There’s no letup now as several teams come off byes and a full slate of 16 games hits us. Several shake-ups in the rankings based off last week, but one team holds the top spot yet again. \n1. Wakulla (5-1) – Last week : 1; beat Godby, 15-6; This week : bye \nThe War Eagles handled business against Godby despite a not-their-best effort. Wakulla is on a well-deserved rest week as it prepares for its next big district game against Rickards. \n2. Rickards (4-1) – Last week : 2; bye; This week : vs. FAMU DRS (0-5) \nThe Raiders are coming off a bye and get an easy opponent prior to their Wakulla game. This week will be about installing the components necessary to beat the War Eagles on the road and build off their last win over Lincoln. \n3. Chiles (4-1) – Last week : 4; beat Lincol, 17-14; This week : vs. Mosley (3-2) \nThe Timberwolves keep climbing and can enjoy holding the top spot in district. But this is an important week to put the Lincoln win behind them and focus on beating the teams they should beat. Big trap game. \n4. Godby (2-3) – Last week : 3; lost to Wakulla, 15-6; This week : vs. Trinity Christian (5-0) \nThe Cougars lost last year to the Conquerors with one of their best teams. That Trinity team went on to win a second straight 3A state title, while Godby lost in the 5A state final. It will be asking a lot of this year’s less-experienced Godby team to derail an undefeated Trinity team this year. \n5. NFC (4-1) – Last week : 6; bye; This week : vs. Florida High (4-2) \nThe Eagles’ defense has been leading the way this season, and Korey Charles is back in the backfield gaining tons of yards. This is the NFC team we expected at the beginning of the year. \n6. Blountstown (5-1) – Last week : 7; beat Bozeman, 55-21; This week : vs. Marianna (3-2) \nThe Tigers have now rattled off five wins in a row, showing the quality of this year’s team. Quarterback Chasen Roulhac is having a fine season already with seven passing touchdowns vs. one interception, plus 10 scores via the ground. \n7. Florida High (4-2) – Last week : 5; lost to Pensacola Catholic, 19-13; This week : at NFC (4-1) \nThe Seminoles showed heart in coming back from two scores down to tie in the fourth quarter, but they let a district win slip away in the final seconds. It’s important that a young team doesn’t let those feelings linger or else risk a mid-season slide. \n8. John Paul II (4-1) – Last week : 10; beat Rocky Bayou, 20-9; This week : at Tampa Cambridge (5-0) \nDon’t look now but Southwood has another team is grabbing wins. The Panthers have young players, but a good bit of talent. On the defensive side of the ball, JPII has yet to allow more than one opponent touchdown a game, while recording two shutouts. \n9. Madison County (3-3) – Last week : NR; beat Jefferson County, 42-0; This week : vs. Hamilton County (2-4) \nAfter an 0-3 start, the Cowboys have figured out their indentity. That’s resulted in a three-game win streak and back-to-back shutouts of blowout proportion. A win this week would mean top spot in the district. Lots on the line to keep winning. \n10. Jefferson County (3-2) – Last week : 8; lost to Madison County, 42-0; This week : at Potter’s House (3-2) \nHopefully a one-point loss to Taylor County two weeks ago didn’t knock the wheels off the bus for the Tigers after a 3-0 start to the season. But a tough road game may be too much to handle as Jefferson sorts things out. \nDropped out : Lincoln (1-5); Outside looking in : Liberty County (3-3), Leon (2-3), Taylor County (2-3), Franklin County (2-3), West Gadsden (1-4), Maclay (1-4), Aucilla Christian (1-3), East Gadsden (0-5), FAMU DRS (0-5), Munroe (0-5) Buy Photo \nLincoln dropped out of the rankings after a 17-14 loss to Chiles that put the Trojans record at 1-5.
