Kejriwal, who announced the decision in a press conference, claimed an audio of a purported conversation between Khan and a builder in which the former demanded a bribe prompted the decision. First time MLA from Ballimaran, Imran Hussain, will replace Khan. Kejriwal claimed that the Delhi government received allegations of corruption against Khan on Thursday night. Khan had allegedly demanded money to allow construction of a building in his constituency of Matia Mahal to continue. \"We received a complaint last night that a building was being built in his constituency. Its construction was stopped and money was demanded from the builder, who paid. There was a mediator between the MLA and the Minister,\" the CM said, asking BJP to follow its example and dismiss Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for corruption. \"We will not spare anyone, be it Minister, MLA or officer. Just give us evidence and we will remove the culprit the moment such charges are brought to our notice,\" Kejriwal said. Sources in the party claimed Khan had denied any wrongdoing. The Chief Minister said the action had been taken suo motu. \"It was not a result of media expose. There will be no compromise with corruption. The decision has been taken with a heavy heart, as there was a lot of trust involved. He will be suspended until the CBI completes its investigation,” he said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:50:29.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
