Through a scoreless 78 minutes, the Bears dominated play against the Oysters, sending attack after attack at the Oysters keeper, but he made every stop possible. Discouraged by the inability to beat Colorado Rocky Mountain’s keeper, the Bears had a momentary lapse in judgment, allowing the Oysters to net two quick goals around the 80th minute to seal the win. “I don’t know how we lost,” Bears head coach Richard Carter said. “We thoroughly dominated the game; their own coach even said that we dominated the game. We just attacked and attacked all game long, but they stopped everything. “The bad news is we had 33 shots and couldn’t find the back of the net, but the good news is that we had 33 shots on goal tonight.” Rams fall to Cardinals in straight sets Hitting the road for a showdown with the Grand Valley Cardinals, the Roaring Fork Rams fell in straight sets in a close matchup, 23-25, 20-25, 19-25. In the loss to the Cardinals, Dani Minor led all Rams with seven kills. Madilyn Kuhl added six kills and four aces. Grace Brown chipped in with 11 digs and three aces. Lily Ramos added 14 digs an one ace in the losing effort. “We playe with heart and as a team,” Rams head coach Jennifer Dority said. “Grand Valley was prepared to play tonight. They were well-prepared, smart and adjusted to us well. It was a great match.” With the loss, the Rams fall to 3-12 (1-4 WSL), while the Cardinals improve to 11-7 (6-0) and get set for a league showdown to determine the league title, Thursday, against Coal Ridge. Team Sopris takes fifth at Aspen meet The Team Sopris Barracudas took fifth place (266 points) among nine teams at the Ned Mechling Memorial Invitational Swim Meet in Aspen, Oct. 17 and 18. The host Aspen Swim Club won the meet with 799 points, while Castle Rock Swim Team from Denver took second with 412.5 points. The Sopris Swimmer of the Meet Award went to Amy Madsen, who finished with six personal records and seven new USA Swimming B times. She scored in six events including the 100 backstroke (1:20.10), 100 breaststroke (1:34.01), and 500 freestyle (7:03.98), cutting eight, 10, and 49 seconds, respectively. Demons top Tigers, 4-2 Behind two goals from Camilo Landa, the Glenwood Springs Demons boys soccer team cruised to a 4-2 win over the host Summit Tigers, Tuesday. Landa, who has played primarily fullback all season long for the Demons, was bumped up to midfield, Tuesday, resulting in some great runs for the Demons. Thanks to two assists from Will Osier — who leads the Western Slope League in assists — Landa was able to capitalize on two corner kick set pieces against the Tigers. “We practice set pieces a lot,” Demons head coach Wayne Smith said. “That’s what we do best is capitalize off of set pieces. Camilo made the right run both times and we were fortunate that Will’s kick found Camilo in the right spot.” Along with Landa’s two goals, Axel Garces scored an unassisted goal in the 57th minute. Cameron Horning added his league-leading 18th goal of the season in the 78th minute off of an assist from Mason Yellico. But Landa started the scoring for the Demons, setting the tone of the game early in favor of Glenwood Springs. “Camilo is a really talented soccer player,” Smith said. “He’s a great attacking player, but he played a lot of back line defense for us because we were lacking there. He’s got a lot of speed and caused problems for the Tigers. It was great to see from him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:42:21.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
