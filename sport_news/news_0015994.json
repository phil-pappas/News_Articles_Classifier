It's the rulebook of another world,\" said Orban.\nHe also hit out at France and Germany for refusing to countenance \"any doubts\" over a multicultural society.\n\"We in Hungary decide what we want or don't want. We don't want that,\" he said.\nAlmost 600,000 people have arrived in Europe so far this year, with many of them heading for Germany and Sweden.\nOrban asserted that most asylum seekers arriving in Europe are actually economic migrants.\n\"Not everyone is entitled to a life in Germany or a life in Hungary. That's only for those who have worked for it,\" he said.\nIn the face of a historic surge in migrant arrivals, Hungary in September sealed its border with Serbia. On Thursday, it announced it had also completed a fence along the Croatian border.\nHungary's use of fences and its treatment of migrants -- including serious clashes on September 16 between police and migrants -- has been sharply criticised, including by UN chief Ban Ki-moon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:09:45.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
