She left school after her junior year for the WNBA. \nCoach Muffet McGraw said the biggest question facing Notre Dame is who will replace Loyd as the player to take clutch shots. Two players expected to help fill the void are 6-3 forward Brianna Turner and point guard Lindsay Allen, the second- and third-leading scorers last season. \nWith eight All-Americans on the roster, McGraw said she expects the Irish will have a number of players who can make clutch shots. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:05:31.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
