He will replace Lloyd McClendon, who was fired earlier this month after two seasons as Seattle's manager.\nMariners general manager Jerry Dipoto and Servais shared a working relationship with the Angels, where Dipoto was GM and Servais oversaw scouting and player development.\nDipoto came to Seattle after leaving behind a rocky relationship with the Angels and manager Mike Scioscia over the summer. He and Servais shared a similar organizational philosophy in the Angels organization, so a re-teaming of the two wasn't a major surprise.\nThe Mariners haven't made the postseason since 2001, the longest playoff drought by any Major League Baseball team. The only team in any of the four major sports with a longer drought is the Bills, who last made the postseason in 1999.\nServais was the Angels' assistant GM for four seasons. Before that, he was the Texas Rangers ' senior director of player development from 2006-2011. Servais was a catcher for four teams over 11 major league seasons and he also was a member of Team USA that won gold in the 1988 Olympic Games.\nInformation from ESPN Stats & Information was included in this report.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments \"\nMariners to give Scott Servais first chance to manage in major leagues \"\nMonster Hurricane Patricia Makes Landfall in Mexico \"\nHoneymooners Stranded as Hurricane Patricia Hits Mexico \"\nTrump Slams Carson as 'Super Low Energy' \"\nRoyals Return to World Series, Beat Blue Jays in ALCS Game 6 \"\nTwins Denied Learner Permits for Being Too Much Alike \"\nTiny Preemie Kept Warm With Plastic Bag After Birth \"\nRoad Rage Killing Shows Broken System, Albuquerque Officials Say \"\nSee Bystanders React to a Child Being Bullied \"\nA Look at Deadly Category 5 Hurricanes That Made Landfall \"\nWhy Did Hurricane Patricia Become a Monster So Quickly? \"\nTexas to Get More Heavy Rain, Heightened Flood Threat Colorado Theater Shooter James Holmes Assaulted in Prison \"\nAuthorities: 1 Killed, 3 Wounded in Tennessee State Shooting \"\nSoldier Killed in Iraq Raid Belonged to Delta Force \"\nFBI to Help Investigate Fatal Police Shooting of Florida Man Feds Fine San Francisco Zoo Over Death of Young Gorilla \"\nPhiladelphia 76ers Throw Shade at John Kasich After Insult \"\nHundreds at Candlelight Vigil for Swedish School Stabbings \"\n43 Killed in Fiery Bus-Truck Collision in French Wine Region Fire Destroys Historic Synagogue in New Jersey \"\nAhmed Mohamed Gets His Clock Back \"\nKaty Perry Isn't Only Musician in Iowa This Weekend for Campaign \"\nFeds Seize Lethal-Injection Drugs Imported by Texas, Arizona \"\nK-9 Dog’s ‘Last Call’ Captured in Heart-Wrenching Video \"\nArk.
