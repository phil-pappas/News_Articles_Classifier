NEW YORK – The retaliation came in the forms of 13 runs and 13 hits, a payback more helpful to the Mets ultimate goal than a hit by pitch ever could be.\nWith tensions running high here in the aftermath of Chase Utley ending Ruben Tejada’s season with a questionable slide, the Mets opted not to plunk any Dodgers batter, but instead bludgeoned their pitcher to move within one victory of reaching the NLCS.\n“The greatest retaliation is winning the game,” veteran Michael Cuddyer said.\nGAME 3 PHOTO GALLERY \nThe Mets took a 2-1 lead in this best-of-five NLDS after pounding the Dodgers, 13-7, on Monday night at Citi Field. Curtis Granderson tied the franchise record with five RBIs in one postseason game, and delivered the go-ahead three-run double in the second, and the 13 runs set the franchise mark for a playoff game.\nThe Mets erased an early 3-0 deficit by scoring the game’s next 10 runs, and send Steven Matz to the mound tonight in their attempt to clinch the series.\n“I think the boos at the introductions were kind of a big statement leading into the game,” Mets starting pitcher Matt Harvey said. “We knew the biggest thing going in was coming out on top, and scoring as many runs as we did, that kind of did all the talking.”\nThe first playoff game at Citi Field brought out the largest crowd for a Mets game at this park, and emotions were high leading up to the first pitch. The bad blood from Utley’s slide had the crowd of 44,276 fired up, and Utley received a thundering chorus of boos during introductions while the camera stayed on him for a few extra seconds.\nTejada was the last player introduced before the starters and received a hearty ovation, and came onto the field in full uniform in a walking boot and with a cane.\n“It was nice having him part of the ceremony,” said Mets captain and third baseman David Wright. “For him to come in today and provide us with that emotional lift was big. I think it’s a good rallying cry for us to go out there and take this series for him.”\nMets manager Terry Collins told Harvey not to retaliate by hitting an opposing batter, and he listened to his manager. No player on either side was hit by a pitch.\nThe energy in the stadium dissipated early when Dodgers claimed a 3-0 lead in the second. Harvey, making his first career playoff start, allowed four straight singles, including a two-RBI single by Yasmani Grandal, and Carl Crawford scored on a throwing error by Granderson to give the Dodgers the early three-run edge.\nThose were the only three runs Harvey allowed in five innings.\nThe Mets didn’t trail for long, claiming the lead for good in the bottom of the second.\nJust like the Dodgers, the Mets strung together four straight singles, with Travis d’Arnaud capping the stretch with an RBI single that sliced the lead to 3-1.\nWith the bases loaded and two outs, Granderson ripped Brett Anderson’s first pitch – a 92 mph fastball -- off the center field wall to clear the bases and give the Mets a 4-3 lead.\n“The way this team responded offensively,” Wright said, “it was incredible.”\nOne inning later, the Mets expanded that lead with a two-run blast by d’Arnaud that gave them a 6-3 lead, and the Mets put the game away in the fourth.\nDaniel Murphy lofted a two-out RBI single to left to expand the lead to 7-3, and Yoenis Cespedes followed with a booming three-run shot into the second deck in left for a 10-3 edge. Cespedes’ homer induced a chant of “MVP” for the trade acquisition, and the energetic crowd at Citi Field roared at the moment more than it did at any other point.\n“This guy’s electrifying on the field,” Collins said. “He’s a dangerous player.”\nAs the Mets grabbed the big lead, Mets fans started louder chants of “We want Utley” in hope Dodgers manager Don Mattingly might send the second baseman to the plate for potential retaliation, but Utley never made an appearance in the blowout.\nThe Mets now sit one win away from their first NLCS in nine years, and will attempt to beat Kershaw for the second time in this series.\n“When you have the opportunity you need to take advantage,” Wright said. “Hopefully we can tomorrow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:29:46.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
