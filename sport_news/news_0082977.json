The Blue Devils will try to end a seven-game losing streak to the Indians. Game: McEachern (3-1) at Marietta (1-4, 0-1), 7:30 p.m.Last year: McEachern 37, Marietta 23All-time series: McEachern leads 15-11-1Prediction: McEachern 35, Marietta 10McEachern was required to do some offensive reshuffling with receiver Tyler Smith out for the season with a knee injury.The first week without him resulted in a disappointing 9-6 loss to Peachtree Ridge. After failing to score a touchdown against the Lions, the Indians bounced back with a 38-0 win over Lovejoy.After a week of rest and recovery, the Indians’ real season begins tonight at longtime rival Marietta to begin Region 4 play.“We played well against Lovejoy. It was a solid performance,” McEachern coach Kyle Hockman said. “We’re resilient. We bounced back from adversity. We’re still adjusting to getting better and working on different things. We made a few adjustments to personnel and made adjustments in the red zone.”The Indians have won their last seven meetings against Marietta and are not catching the Blue Devils at their best. Mistakes doomed Marietta in its 40-21 loss to Hillgrove last Friday, allowing a safety on a high snap and losing a fumble that led to a Hawks touchdown.Marietta coach Scott Burton said after the game, “We were really inconsistent and, right now, we have to find a way to fix that.”Marietta will have to play disciplined defense in order to slow down Georgia-bound Bailey Hockman, who has thrown for 702 yards and five touchdowns this season.Even though the offense is missing Smith, who was the team’s best deep threat, the Indians have other quality options in Tyler Simmons and Brandon Smith.Also, Sam Jackson is coming into his own at running back this season after earning the starting nod at midseason last year.For Marietta, Malachi Diggs has thrown for 483 yards and six touchdowns. Dewayne Smith and Devon Henderson have been his top two targets with a combined 281 yards and six touchdowns.
