It was a lack of understanding how important, actually, Olympic Games are. So now we want to learn [from] that mistake.\"\nHe'll get a chance to see Thursday how well that education process is going when the U.S. opens qualifying play for next summer's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The U.S. will meet Canada, Cuba and Panama in group play, beginning in Kansas City, Kan.\nMexico, the defending Olympic champion, heads the other four-team group, which starts play Friday at StubHub Center. Mexico meets Costa Rica first then will play Haiti on Sunday before the tournament moves to suburban Denver for Mexico's group-play final against Honduras.\nFIFA ban of Jack Warner may be part of larger strategy Kevin Baxter FIFA's campaign to keep President Sepp Blatter in office -- and, presumably, out of jail -- once again caught Jack Warner in its crosshairs Tuesday when world soccer's governing body banned its former vice president for life .\nWarner \"committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and...\nFIFA's campaign to keep President Sepp Blatter in office -- and, presumably, out of jail -- once again caught Jack Warner in its crosshairs Tuesday when world soccer's governing body banned its former vice president for life .\nWarner \"committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and...\n(Kevin Baxter) The top two teams in each group advance to the semifinals, where a victory will not only earn it a spot in the final, but also a berth in the Olympic tournament. The winner of the third-place game will advance to a playoff with Colombia with the final invitation to Rio at stake.\nThe U.S. failed to qualify for two of the last three Olympic tournaments, missing out in 2012 when a score-tying goal by El Salvador late in stoppage time dropped the U.S. to third in its group. A housecleaning began shortly afterward with Caleb Porter, who coached the U.S. in that tournament, leaving for the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer.\nA few months later, Klinsmann signed a new contract with U.S. Soccer that not only extended his tenure as coach of the senior national team, but made him technical director for all U.S. men's national team programs as well. In that role Klinsmann appointed Andi Herzog, a former teammate at Bayern Munich and an assistant on the World Cup coaching staff last year, to head the Olympic-qualifying effort.\nGet the latest in sports with our free newsletter >>\n\"For the U.S., the Olympics is always very, very special,\" said Herzog, who finished his playing career with the Galaxy. \"That's a big stage for our young players to show the rest of the world that the U.S. has very talented young players.\"\nAmong the talented players on Herzog's 20-man roster is Gedion Zelalem, a German-born teenager who became a U.S. citizen last winter, and Stanford junior Jordan Morris, who has already made six appearances with the senior national team.\nBut some talent is absent, too. Forward Rubio Rubin, who led the U.S. to the quarterfinals of the U-20 World Cup in June, was not released by Dutch club Utrecht and German American midfielder Julian Green, who has dropped to the fourth tier of the German league since scoring for the U.S. in the World Cup knockout round last year, was not selected by Herzog.\nThe roster for Mexico, which won its first Olympic soccer title three years ago in London, includes a couple of players who are familiar with StubHub Center: Forward Erick Torres played at the stadium with Chivas USA before the MLS franchise folded and Real Salt Lake visited six times during physical defender Carlos Salcedo's two seasons with the team. Salcedo, 22, has already made four appearances for Mexico's senior national team, which did not give up a goal while he was on the field.\nThe Mexican team also includes teenage goalkeeper Raul Gudino, who plays club soccer for Portuguese power Porto, and midfielders Arturo Gonzalez (Atlas) and Marco Bueno (Leon), who were on Mexico's U-17 World Cup championship team in 2011.\nFollow Kevin Baxter on Twitter @kbaxter11\nALSO\nEquine stars take to skies to reach Longines Masters show jumping in L.A.\nLakers' Nick Young says he's learned from struggles, still 'Swaggy P'\nDodgers less than inspiring the night after, fall to San Francisco Giants, 5-0\nPrivacy Policy Soccer Sports Major League Soccer Chivas USA Bayern Munich Portland Timbers San Francisco Giants", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-erskine-20151001-column.html", "http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-go-quietly-20150930-story.html", "http://www.latimes.com/la-sports-newsletter-htmlstory.html", "http://www.twitter.com/kbaxter11", "http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-fifa-bans-ex-vp-warner-for-life-20150929-story.html", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ad3ca/turbine/la-sp-sn-fifa-jack-warner-sepp-blatter-20150929", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c6cc3/turbine/la-sp-us-soccer-olympics-20151001", "http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-hawaii-20151001-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-01T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:05:54.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
