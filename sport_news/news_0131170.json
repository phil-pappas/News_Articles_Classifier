The Cubs won 4-1. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) \nCHICAGO (AP) — No matter how the playoffs turn out for the Chicago Cubs, manager Joe Maddon wanted to know one thing. \nHe asked how anyone could be “disappointed with anything our players have done.” \nThe Cubs visit Pittsburgh on Wednesday night for the NL wild-card game. It’s the first playoff appearance for the franchise in seven years. \nThe emergence of several young players helped turn the Cubs into one of the best teams in baseball even though they finished third in their division. \nThey will send Jake Arrieta to the mound against Gerrit Cole and the Pirates, hoping his dominant run continues into the postseason. If they win, the Cubs meet St. Louis in the division series. Otherwise, it’s on to next year.
