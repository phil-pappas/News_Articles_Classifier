(OzarksSportsZone.com) -- For the second year in a row, Springfield Catholic’s Anna Rader proved her talents in the world of tennis by earning fourth-place overall in Saturday’s 41st annual Class 1 singles tournament at Cooper Tennis Complex in Springfield. Rader’s teammate Emily Kroutil earned fifth-place; Mount Vernon’s doubles team Whitney Wiehe and Abby Rinker earned eighth; and Glendale’s Rachel Dwyer nabbed eighth in Class 2 singles. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS ANNA RADER – SPRINGFIELD CATHOLIC Just a sophomore at Springfield Catholic, Rader swept the courts on Friday, knocking off Windor’s Ellie Jablanowski (6-0, 6-0) and Tolton Catholic’s Ellie Kayser (6-3, 6-0). Saturday was a different story. A repeat of 2014, Rader went up against Pembroke Hill’s Yurie Heard – who won the state title last season and again on Saturday. Set on retaining that title, Heard defeated Rader 6-0, 6-1. Looking at the positives, Rader was pleased with her performance in that match. She said, “I feel like I’ve definitely improved my game since last year. I had to play Yurie then, and again this year. She’s a great player. And I played her better today than I did last year.” Up next was the third-place match against Villa Duchesne High’s Riley Clarke. Despite Rader’s efforts, Clarke narrowly outscored her, 6-4, 6-3.“I knew the matches today would be tough, but I came out and played my best,” Rader said. With these losses, Rader’s record went from undefeated to 33-2. But nabbing fourth-place is an improvement for Rader after earning sixth last year.“My goal was to reach the semifinals this year, so I got to my goal. I improved by two spots, so this was definitely a success,” she said. EMILY KROUTIL – SPRINGFIELD CATHOLIC In 2013, Kroutil earned an eighth-place state medal as just a freshman. Hoping to place better than that this time around, Kroutil battled hard over the last couple of days to nab fifth-place overall alongside her teammate and friend, Rader. On Friday, Kroutil (32-4) defeated Meredith Houk (Warrensburg) and Kelly Westphal (Chillicothe), but fell to Helias Catholic’s Ashley Dowden 6-1, 6-3 to continue the tournament in consolation. Kroutil came back Saturday energetic and 100-percent ready for the competition to come. First up was Taylor Crawford of Marshall High. Kroutil lost the first set 4-6, but came back in the second to win it 6-1. Facing an intense third-set test, Kroutil passed with a 7-5 victory to play for fifth-place. With similar competition, Kroutil and Nidhi Bhaskar of MICDS also went into a third set. But Kroutil pulled out the win (4-6, 6-4, 6-2).“I think I did really well, especially since I beat my freshman year record. Today I went to three sets twice but I still think I did really well, and I stayed mentally tough,” Kroutil said. RACHEL DWYER – GLENDALE Losing too many matches to earn a state medal in 2014, Glendale junior Rachel Dwyer wanted to ensure that didn’t happen again. Back in state play for the second time, Dwyer played and defeated a couple of familiar faces on Friday, including fellow Lady Falcon Brooke Smith and Nixa’s Hannah Nelson (6-2, 6-0 and 6-3, 6-2, respectively). It was Kirkwood’s Bridget Mayfield who knocked Dwyer into the consolation round, outscoring her 6-2, 6-0. Falling to Rock Bridge’s Tess Lovig (6-1, 6-2) Saturday morning, Dwyer was set to face Mayfield for the second time in the Class 2 singles tournament. Despite her efforts, Mayfield won 6-1, 6-0. But the eighth-place win is one Dwyer is proud of.“This feels great,” said Dwyer. “I mean, I didn’t even think I was going to medal. My goal was to win just one match, so I’m really proud of myself for getting to where I am.” Dwyer has also been dealing with a longtime knee injury, making the all-state status an even bigger life event in her eyes. “My goal for next year is to hit with more power, because these girls are really intense,” she said. Dwyer finished her junior year 25-7. WHITNEY WIEHE AND ABBY RINKER – MOUNT VERNON Going 3-2 in the Class 1 doubles tournament, Mount Vernon senior Whitney Wiehe and sophomore Abby Rinker finished eighth-place overall. The state appearance marked the Lady Mountaineers’ first since 1987, when current head coach Christine Maddocks was a teen at Mount Vernon High. But what made the win extra special was that Wiehe is Maddocks’ daughter. Proud of the girls as a coach and the all-stater’s mom, Maddocks just couldn’t hold back her tears of joy. Putting her arms around her mother, Wiehe said, “I love you, mom. I’m happy you’re my coach.”“I’m definitely going to miss her,” Maddocks said of her senior daughter. “I’m definitely going to miss her leadership. I hope the other girls will take on that leadership she taught them.” Maddocks – the 2015 Big 8 Undefeated Coach of the Year – has no doubt that Rinker will do just that. Earning a state medal as just a sophomore, Rinker is set to lead her team to eighth-place and beyond next year, especially after having role model Wiehe as a doubles partner. But they weren’t partners for all of this season. Due to unfortunate injuries among other teammates, Wiehe and Rinker were stuck with each other.“Hindsight, now, tells me that I probably should’ve put them together a lot sooner,” Maddocks said.“I told you so,” Wiehe said jokingly. Maddocks said, “Coming in with an 8-1 record and not playing with each other all season long, and then going all the way to state to take eighth is pretty good. And as a team, we went all the way to sectionals this year. So we’ve done very well.”“We knew we would medal. I think today was just an extra bonus, two matches of just playing and having fun. That was the main thing today,” said Rinker.“This was a good way to end the season,” said Wiehe. “I’m glad Abby was my doubles partner for my last year,”“Me, too,” Rinker said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:53:54.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
