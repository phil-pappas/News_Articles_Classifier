(AP) - The Chiefs anticipate Jamaal Charles will miss the remainder of the season after the star running back hurt his right knee in the third quarter of Sunday's loss to Chicago.\nChiefs coach Andy Reid said Monday that results of an MRI on Charles were not yet available, but \"the worst case is the ACL is torn. That's probably the direction it's heading.\"\nCharles was making a cut deep in Bears territory on Sunday when his right knee buckled at a gruesome angle. The four-time Pro Bowl selection needed help from a trainer and linebacker Justin Houston to get off the field, never once putting any weight on his right leg.\nCharles tore the ACL in his other knee four years ago, missing most of the season.\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
