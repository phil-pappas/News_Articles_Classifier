(Photo: Bryan Mitchell, Special to Detroit News) \nMichigan State will host Purdue this weekend and the Spartans will have a good number of prospects on campus who have not been to a game yet this year.\nSteubenville (Ohio) junior tight end Charles Reeves is the most notable of the new names. A four-star prospect on Scout, Reeves is a 6-foot-5, 230-pound mismatch on the outside with his ability to split out and use his basketball player athleticism to go up and catch passes. He has an offer from Michigan, and other schools like Ohio State and West Virginia have been in contact.\nFellow Ohioan Tyrone Chambers, a 6-foot-5, 320-pound junior from Lyndhurst Brush, will be at the game. Chambers could project to either side of the ball, but is being recruited more on defense currently. He has offers from Akron, Bowling Green and Toledo.\nFort Wayne (Ind.) Snider junior offensive tackle Zenden Dellinger has transitioned from tight end this season and his 6-foot-6, 270-pound frame has drawn the interest of many schools, including Michigan State. This will be his first trip to campus. He played against Spartan commit Auston Robertson to open the season.\nTwo notable in-state defensive backs, Livonia Churchill's Jamal Allen and University of Detroit Jesuit's Scotty Nelson, will be in East Lansing. Allen recently visited Iowa and has heard from other Power Five programs. Nelson (6-1, 190 pounds) already holds a Northwestern offer and visited Notre Dame last week.\nMany of Michigan State's committed players in the 2016 class will also attend. That list includes Thiyo Lukusa, A.J. Arcuri, Jonah Morris, Demetric Vance, Brandon Randle, Trishton Jackson, Naquan Jones and Kenney Lyke.\nBachie signs mid-year agreement \nBerea (Ohio) Midpark linebacker Joe Bachie signed his financial aid agreement with Michigan State on Thursday night, allowing him to enroll for the second semester at MSU and go through spring practice with the team.\nBachie (6-2, 225 pounds) was committed to Western Michigan before landing a Spartan offer before their spring game and accepting it. He has since impressed both at the Spartan Elite Camp in June and during his senior season.\nScout's Bill Greene evaluated him in person last week against Midview High School and came away believing the Spartans stole another one from Ohio.\n\"I love this kid's game and he is far more athletic than people believe,\" Greene said. \"He's also an enforcer on the field and he hits people hard. He is going to be a good one for the Spartans.\"\nMore information \nCharles Reeves profile \nZenden Dellinger profile \nJoe Bachie profile \nAllen Trieu began covering the state of Michigan for Scout.com in 2005 and began managing the entire Midwest in 2009. He has been featured on the Big Ten Network on its annual Signing Day Show.
