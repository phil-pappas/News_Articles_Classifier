He claimed that the practice of pulling the weight of other was like exploitation and said a survey would be conducted to ascertain the number of rickshaws in the state so that they could be replaced with e-rickshaws. After inaugurating an e-rickshaw charging centre of the Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Riksha Chalak Kalyan Samiti at Minar road, the CM handed over the keys of 50 e-rickshaws to persons selected under the District Innovation Fund. The initiative of e-rickshaw is a step towards making Karnal a smart city. Khattar said initially this scheme had been implemented in Karnal and on its success it would be replicated in other districts of the state. He said each beneficiary would have to pay only 10 per cent of the total amount, while the rest of the amount would be paid by the administration. He directed to reserve some e-rickshaws for women so that they could travel without any inconvenience. ‘People satisfied with govt’s functioning’ When asked about the completion of one-year tenure of the present state government on October 26, the CM said during this period, the state government had implemented a number of decisions to bring about a positive change in the system and people were satisfied with the functioning of the government.
