Celtics coach Brad Stevens talks of his mentors \n\"There are better coaches than I am and there are a lot of people that could do a good job with that and the key is getting the right guys on the team. They’ve done a great job of that. And then Mike has done a great job, along with his staff -- (Tom Thibodeau) and Monty (Williams) and Nate (McMillan) and Jim Boeheim, all those guys that have been on their staff -- of making it about the team. Kudos to all that have done that because it’s really been a fun ride for all of us to watch.\" \nStevens worked a USA Basketball camp a few years ago under the tutelage of Krzyzewski, and later coached the in World University Games in China in 2011. \n\"I had a blast with it because I was an assistant coach (at the World University Games) with one of my good friends Matt Painter at Purdue and Cuonzo Martin, who is now the head coach at Cal,\" Stevens said. \"We were assistants together, we stayed in the dorm in Shenzhen, China, for 15 days. The dorm was so small that when we Skyped each other’s families, we were in the family, we were talking to each other’s families. We had a great time.\" \nStevens, who graduated from Zionsville and DePauw, has a 65-99 record in two seasons with the Celtics, with the team posting a 15-win improvement from Year 1 to Year 2.
