(AP) - The trustees of New Hampshire's community college system have formalized a tuition freeze for the current academic year.\nThe trustees said the colleges had promised a freeze based on the level of state funding in the budget, but couldn't formally adopt the rate until the state budget was enacted.\nThe board voted on the freeze at its meeting Thursday at White Mountains Community College in Berlin.\nIn-state tuition will remain at $200/credit, or $600 for a three-credit course. This brings the annual in-state tuition cost of full-time attendance at one a community college to $4,800-$6,000, depending on course load.\nThe community college system has not raised tuition since 2012. Last year, the community colleges reduced tuition by 5 percent.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:42:22.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
