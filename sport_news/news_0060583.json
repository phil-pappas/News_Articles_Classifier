Despite missing training camp and the first game of the season because of off-the-field issues, the junior enters Saturday’s game between the third-ranked Utes and USC at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with three interceptions — ranking him second in the Pac-12 behind teammate Marcus Williams.\nUtah cornerbacks coach Sharrieff Shah said Hatfield is doing a better job each week and is finally in football shape.\n“He’s done a real good job of being patient, of working himself back into the fold, and then being a leader,” Shah said. “It’s what we didn’t have from him last year. He was learning the position and didn’t know how to lead people in the right way.\n“I think that some of the events that happened this summer have given him a different perspective to put things in the proper place and count his blessings and take a more leadership role,” Shah continued. “And that’s been really nice to see from him.”\nWORKING OUT: Injuries have plagued senior receiver Kenneth Scott throughout his career at Utah — beginning in 2010 with a broken ankle in camp and a season-ending injury in the 2013 opener. Now, he’s healthy — coming off a career-high 116-yard receiving game — on a nationally ranked, undefeated team.\n“Everything happens for a reason and obviously this is a pretty good reason right now,” Scott said. “I’m still here.”\nSTEALING SIGNALS: Utah coach Kyle Whittingham downplayed all the hoopla about the Utes huddling up against Arizona State to alleviate concerns about sideline signals being stolen. He told reporters that it's something they never complain about.\n“It’s our job to make sure that our signals are undecipherable,” Whittingham said. “It’s not their job. It’s not their job to look the other way.”\nHELTON EXCITED: USC interim head coach Clay Helton , who replaced the fired Steve Sarkisian , is looking forward to his Coliseum debut at the helm. He said it’ll be very special.\n“Any time that you get around the Trojan family and get to represent them and the University of Southern California, man, what a great opportunity,” Helton explained after Thursday’s practice. “I’m having more fun than anybody in the world right now.”\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com\nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:06:21.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
