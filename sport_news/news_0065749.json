Someone later took it out of the tree and posted a photo of it on Instagram next to a trash bin.\nThe statue hasn't been seen since.\nRyan and her husband, an artist, bought the statue years ago for $1,200. Ryan said it has a \"slightly sinister quality.\"\nThey're offering a $300 reward.\nThe daughter was punished with extra chores.\nWhere's Ronald? After a statue of Ronald McDonald went missing in August, a Northampton woman has tracked the statue's movements on social media and put up fliers offering a $300 reward.\nPosted by Daily Hampshire Gazette on Friday, October 16, 2015", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1PyDJUg", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHampshireGazette", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHampshireGazette/posts/10153148139667513"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:19:06.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
