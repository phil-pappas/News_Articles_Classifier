It's purely speculation. I'll be checking over my shoulder to see if anyone is positioning themselves in the director's box tomorrow. \n\"I'm easy with it. My job doesn't change. I still need to win a football match which I'm aware of. I'll be taking full responsibility for the team's performance and we'll win tomorrow. \n\"You just deal with it because it's part and parcel of the job. If you don't win games and you come under pressure and someone else gets linked to your job. \n\"I've been linked with a lot of jobs myself, I can't stop myself being linked and I can't stop, while I'm sitting in the seat, other people being linked. \" \nSherwood has a fully-fit squad for the first time this season with Gabby Agbonlahor available after a calf injury. \nMark Bunn could replace Brad Guzan in goal after the American's error in Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Chelsea. \nSherwood added: \"Everyone is fit. There are a few who haven't done as much training as we would've liked so will have to assess whether they're going to be ready but it's all quiet in the treatment room.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:13:44.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
