Paul Zoeller/Staff × Most of the questions for Charleston Southern’s football team during the preseason centered on a defensive unit that was replacing major contributors from a year ago. \nComing Up \nWHO: Charleston Southern (4-1, 1-0 Big South) at Presbyterian (1-5, 0-1) \nWHEN: Saturday, 2 p.m. \nWHERE: Bailey Memorial Stadium, Clinton \nWEB: csusports.com The Buccaneers were returning 10 starters on offense, but head coach Jamey Chadwell was concerned that a less experienced defense might struggle through the early stages of the season. That has not been the case. Defensive coordinator Chad Staggs has successfully plugged in a bevy of underclassmen and first-time starters this fall. Through five games, the Bucs (4-1 overall, 1-0 in the Big South) are ranked second nationally among FCS schools in total defense, and lead the Big South Conference in both rush and pass defense. Here’s a look at the defensive numbers this season: — 225 yards per game, 2nd in FCS — 108.6 rushing yards per game, 1st in BSC — 146.4 passing yards per game, 1st in BSC — 13 sacks this season, 2nd in BSC Charleston Southern, ranked 23rd this week in the FCS coaches’ poll, has allowed a total of 10 points over the last six quarters and, in last week’s 37-7 win over Monmouth, gave up just 115 total yards. For the season, CSU has allowed only 69 first downs. Staggs has been pleased with the play of his unit to date, while realizing the season is only halfway done. “So far, we’ve probably exceeded my expectations a little,” Staggs said. “We’re not as good as some of the early numbers show but we have played pretty well so far. We’re going to face some of the better offensive teams on the schedule the rest of the way so we’ve still got a ways to go.” The senior leadership of the squad — linebackers Zack Johnson and Aaron Brown, and defensive back Malcolm Jackson — have helped the young players develop quickly. “Losing five really good players up front, I thought we might have some growing pains,” Johnson said. “But, I think we saw the talent of those younger guys and we all felt we had a chance to be a good defense. The one thing we have here is a culture of success and the guys coming in buy into what we do from day one. “We’re not the biggest. We don’t have the most talent compared to teams we play. But we play fast and our coaches preach playing hard on every play.” Outside linebacker Solomon Brown, a redshirt freshman from Daniel High School, is one of several underclassmen making an impact on the defense. Brown already has been named Big South Conference freshman of the week twice, including last week after making seven tackles, including two tackles for loss, against Monmouth. Brown said getting the opportunity to redshirt last season allowed him to adjust to the speed of the game at the college level. He felt prepared for his chance this fall. “Practicing every day against our offense, which has some really good speed, helped me adjust,” Brown said. Along the front, Staggs has seen solid contributions from freshmen Johnny Robinson and Mike Taylor, and sophomore Anthony Ellis. A position of concern in August has become a position of relative strength at midseason. “We are deeper along the defensive line right now than we’ve ever been,” Staggs said. “We really feel like we have nine or 10 guys that can play up there. They’re doing a good job and looking ahead we have the potential to have a really good front seven over the next several years.” Get more news delivered to your inbox:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:18:22.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
