I have a lot of respect for the guys at Carlisle. They’re good dudes.” \nSvarda’s final carry enabled the Mohawks to break a tie at the top of the Southwestern Buckeye League Buckeye Division. \nAfter a Carlisle fumble, Svarda broke through the line and went 26 yards to push the Mohawk lead to 28-7 with 10:20 left as Madison improved to 4-3 overall and 3-0 in the division. \n“We were just going out confident that we could drive the ball down the field again,” Svarda said. “We try to drive down the field every time. The offensive line did a great job tonight.” \nThe Indians drove on their first possession, marching to the Madison 15 behind the running of Zach Friend, but came away empty when Bradley Harrison pushed a 32-yard field-goal attempt wide right. \nThe 65-yard opening drive accounted for more than half of Carlisle’s 120 yards in the first half. \n“It is hard to adjust to their speed,” Madison coach Steve Poff said. “You can’t simulate it in practice how fast their line is or how their backs run. It took a little time, but once we adjusted there was a difference there.” \nMadison scored on its first drive of the game on a 21-yard run by Friend and added a 15-yard scamper by quarterback KC Lindon on third-and-nine to open a 14-0 lead at the break. \nCarlisle got on the board the first time it touched the ball in the second half when Ridge Reed got loose for a 73-yard scoring run to cut it to 14-7. \nHowever, before Reed could cap his 14- yard night on 18 carries with his second touchdown, Lindon and Svarda had put the game out of reach for the Mohawks. \nMadison finished with 242 of its 269 yards coming on the ground, grinding out 21 first downs. Carlilse, which fell to 4-3 and 3-1, managed 121 yards on the ground on 31 carries after entering play averaging 274 yards rushing.
