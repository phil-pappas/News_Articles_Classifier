Richard Mackson Oct 23, 2015 at 4:45p ET 0Shares \nIn a move clearly designed to throw shade on the last rockstar quarterback in the Los Angeles area, Josh Rosen has one-upped Matt Leinart by adding an actual hot tub to his dorm room. \nHonestly, I don't know if I could like this guy more. \nCollege football has needed Josh Rosen to step up and assume the Johnny Manziel mantle for some time. Everyone is so boring right now. Either the quarterbacks suck -- I'm looking at you SEC -- or they're always Tweeting about their class schedule or their favorite Bible verse or whatever. \nSo what does Rosen do? \nHot tub in the dorm room. true A video posted by Josh Rosen (@josh3rosen) on Oct 17, 2015 at 12:15pm PDT \nPower moves only. \nYou think Rosen might have a good weekend? He just threw for nearly 400 yards last night against Cal and now he's got the entire weekend off and a hottub in hsi dorm room? Let's just say I bet his weekend is more fun than yours and mine. \nOh, and the girl in the photo with him? true A photo posted by christine (@totallychristine) on Oct 17, 2015 at 8:41pm PDT \nShe carried a sign with her phone number on it to the Arizona game. And now Rosen has her in the hot tub. \nThis guy is a freshman, what's he going to be capable of by the time he's a junior and getting ready for the NFL Draft? \nYou know what has to happen now, right? Me and Leinart have to interview him in the hottub for the Countdown Show. There's no other way this story progresses, this is Hollywood, you have to give the people what they want. \nCall me, Rosen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:57:46.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
