A male then tried to pull her back inside the car.\nAvon police confirm alcohol was involved and Manziel admitted to having two drinks earlier. Still, the officer did not notice any slurred speech or impairment. \nPer the police report, Manziel and his girlfriend, Colleen Crowley, were in downtown Cleveland drinking and had plans to go see a movie. When he decided he wanted to pick up a friend also, this upset Crowley, who then wanted to return to Avon.\nManziel told police he began heading home and while on I-90, he had Crowley's cell phone on his lap to control the music. During the ride, Crowley began accusing him of \"driving bad.\" He told police that Crowley grabbed his wallet from the center divider and threw it out the window.\nManziel then pulled over his vehicle and went to look for the wallet. After parking, he stated \"she did try to get out of the car.\" He then admitted to \"trying to grab her arm to keep her from 'riding' out of the car.\"\nPolice asked Manziel if - at any point - there was any striking, punching or pulling of hair. Manziel responded, \"no.\"\nCrowley did suffer a friction burn to her wrist, per the report. \nPolice say based on statements provided by the pair, lack of physical evidence, use of alcohol, and neither wanting to press charges, no arrests were made. The couple left the police station together. \nBrowns General Manager Ray Farmer released the following statement regarding the incident: \n\"We were aware of the situation. It is a matter that we take seriously and have express our concerns to Johnny directly. Those conversations will remain private and we will refrain from further comment at this time.\"  \nManziel commented on the incident via Twitter:\nColleen and I got into a dumb public argument on the way home Monday afternoon.  It probably looked more interesting than it was and...\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015 I know I would stop and check if I saw a couple arguing on the side of the road.  It was embarrassing but not serious...\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015 and when we talked to the police and they realized everything was alright and I was sober, we went home together and everything is fine.\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015 Copyright 2015   WOIO .
