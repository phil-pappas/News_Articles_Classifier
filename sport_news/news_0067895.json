In that game, Ashton Sitkowski had nine kills. Shameka Ealy had eight kills and four blocks.Up next, the Lady Cyclones took down Marion 25-18, 15-25, 15-12. Sitkowski had eight kills, while Madison McKinley had seven.Against Cabot, McKinley had seven kills and Ealy had six kills.“Ashton obviously had a great tournament, averaging about five kills per set,” Jones said. “Shameka Ealy and Madison McKinley both averaged about four per set. Bailey Wilbers and Emily Posey each averaged three kills per set. That means we are doing a good job of distributing the ball to all our players in the offense.“It also means we are getting good passes to the setters. Our libero Rachel Prochazka has been doing a great job of reading the defense and making plays on hard hits. Our setting was pretty spot on. Great ball distribution and leadership on the floor by both Anna Claire Pilkington and Sarah Hale.”Russellville will play Alma today, but Jones said the Lady Cyclones biggest match will be on Thursday against Greenwood.“The winner will more than likely have the No. 1 seed for the state tournament in the 6A-Central. The tournament is in Greenwood this year. We would like to have that seed of course, but to go to a state championship, you are going to have to play some good teams either way.”Thursday’s game will be Russellville’s Dig Pink event, which raises money and awareness for breast cancer. The Lady Cyclones raised $3,500 last year.“I am hoping to get that up to $4,000 this year,” Jones said.
