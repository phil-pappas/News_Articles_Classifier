European markets were mixed. Futures point to a lower Wall Street opening today. The dollar declined against the euro and the yen. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose to just under $45 per barrel. NEW YORK (AP) - There's not much support today for a bullish view of U.S. growth prospects in the fourth quarter of the year. Four-fifths of the experts surveyed by the National Association of Business Economics expect fourth-quarter growth of at least 2 percent. But only 7 percent predicted growth will top 3 percent, down from 16 percent in July. TOKYO (AP) - Toyota is at the top again. The world's top-selling automaker for the first nine months of this year sold nearly 7.5 million vehicles, and overtook Volkswagen which was in the No. 1 spot for the half year. Sales of Toyota, Volkswagen and General motors all slipped in the latest reports. Volkswagen sales may suffer further because of a scandal over software that allowed them to cheat U.S. emissions tests. DETROIT (AP) - The United Auto Workers union and General Motors Co. have reached a tentative agreement on a new four-year contract, avoiding a strike for now. The UAW said the agreement was reached late last night, 16 minutes before the midnight deadline it had set to either reach an agreement or call a strike at GM's U.S. plants. Details weren't immediately available. The UAW says local union leaders will meet Wednesday in Detroit. If they approve it, U.S. hourly workers will vote on it. LONDON (AP) - There is no let-up in corporate executives' appetite for acquisitions despite volatility in the stock market and mounting concerns over the global economy, particularly China. According to a survey released today, consulting firm EY says the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, or M&A, is set to continue over the coming year. It found that 59 percent of global companies are planning to secure at least one deal over the next 12 months, partly as a means of cushioning waning global growth as China's economy slows. BEIJING (AP) - Facing pressure to pep up a cooling economy, Chinese leaders met today to craft a new long-range blueprint to guide development through the end of this decade. The Communist Party's five-year plan is a throwback to the era of central planning but still plays a key role, allowing the ruling party to highlight its goals and planned policy shifts. Party leaders are expected to use the 2016-2020 plan to renew their commitment to a marathon effort to shift China from reliance on trade and investment to more self-sustaining growth driven by domestic consumption.
