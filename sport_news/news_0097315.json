The money-starved state government has failed to pay bills to various power-generating companies, which supply electricity to Jammu and Kashmir, and as a result the surcharge applicable on the unpaid bills is mounting on a daily basis. According to the documents available with The Tribune, the surcharge nearing Rs 20 crore has been levied on the unpaid bill of a single company. The surcharge, applicable on the unpaid amount after a period of 60 days is counted on day to day basis and is currently rated at 18 per cent per annum. The state purchases electricity from at least 15 companies, including Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs). The state government last month released an amount of Rs 959 crore to various power supply companies as pressure mounted on it after one of the CPSUs considered suspension of supplies. The amount released in August, and not fully disbursed yet, however, was less than 20 per cent of the Rs 5,035-crore liability in the power sector, calculated till March 31 this year. According to official documents, the state government this year paid a total of Rs 1,601 crore to various power supplying companies and was still short of several thousand crore rupees to clear all the liabilities. Jammu and Kashmir has been sinking in debt over the past decade as its total liabilities have grown from Rs 16,790 crore in 2005-06 to Rs 44,646 crore in 2013-14. The state’s internal debt has mounted from Rs 7,502 crore in 2005-06 to Rs 24,715 crore in 2013-14 while as loans and advances from the Central government have witnessed a decrease from Rs 3,508 crore in 2005-06 to Rs 1,775 crore in 2013-14. The state has an estimated hydroelectric potential of 20,000 MW, out of which projects of about 16,200 MW capacity have been identified, but the state’s current installed capacity is mere 969.96 MW. Jammu and Kashmir produces only 18 per cent of the power it consumes annually and has a “huge gap” in revenue receipts and incurred expenditure. The transmission and distribution losses in the state are astounding “55 per cent” and are blamed on technical as well as commercial reasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:37:38.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
