FIFA provisionally banned President Sepp Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini for 90 days. \nZURICH (AP) - The Latest from the FIFA investigation (all time local): \n___ \n7 p.m. \nThe UEFA executive committee has expressed \"full confidence\" in Michel Platini despite his 90-day suspension by the FIFA ethics committee. \nDefying FIFA, European soccer's governing body says it is not invoking statues requiring its highest-ranking vice president, Angel Maria Villar, to be appointed acting president. \nUEFA says \"this is because the UEFA executive committee is aware that the UEFA president will immediately take all necessary steps to appeal the decision of the FIFA ethics committee to clear his name.\" \nThe UEFA statement stressed that the executive committee \"expressed its full confidence\" in Platini and will meet next Thursday in Nyon. All 54 UEFA member associations will meet at UEFA headquarters on the same day. \nPlatini was questioned by Swiss investigators last month about a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) he received from FIFA in 2011 for work carried out up to 2002. \nSepp Blatter is being investigated as a suspect in the case, while Platini is being treated \"between a witness and an accused person,\" according to Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber. \nBlatter was also suspended for 90 days on Thursday. \n___ \n6:26 p.m. \nTwitter bio deleted. \nAfter Sepp Blatter was relieved of his duties by FIFA, the governing body edited his Twitter profile (www.twitter.com/SeppBlatter) to remove the reference to being president. \nBlatter started a 90-day suspension on Thursday after the ethics committee acted against its own leader, who is under criminal investigation in Switzerland. \nNo tweet has appeared on Blatter's account since Friday. \n___ \n6:15 p.m. \nChung Mong-joon says he will \"mobilize all legal means available to expose the injustice\" of the FIFA decision to ban him from soccer for six years. \nThe former FIFA vice president from South Korea received the ban Thursday as a result of the ethics committee investigation into 2022 World Cup bidding. South Korea was one of the bidding nations in the contest won by Qatar. \n\"While this decision does not come as a surprise, I am profoundly disappointed at an act that, once again, demonstrates the profoundly irresponsible and unethical nature of FIFA,\" Chung said. \nThe ban will prevent Chung from pursuing plans to stand in the Feb. 26 emergency presidential election. \nChung claims that, contrary to public comments by Sepp Blatter, the 79-year-old FIFA president is angling to stay in power. \nBlatter was handed a 90-day ban on Thursday, as was UEFA President Michel Platini. \n\"International football community is already taking note of the fact that President Blatter plans to come back to his current position after February 26, 2016, by which time the provisional 90-day ban would have expired, and if the emergency FIFA Congress is unable to elect the next president,\" Chung said. \"This decision by the ethics committee has completely undermined the legitimacy and fairness of the next FIFA presidential election.\" \n___ \n4 p.m. \nIOC President Thomas Bach says \"enough is enough\" at FIFA and is calling for a \"credible external presidential candidate\" to take over world soccer's scandal-scarred governing body. \nBach says FIFA \"cannot continue to remain passive\" and \"must act swiftly to regain credibility\" for the organization and the sport. \nThe International Olympic Committee leader says FIFA has a \"structural problem\" that \"will not be solved simply by the election of a new president.\" \nBach says FIFA must \"acccelerate and deepen the reform process\" and \"should also be open for a credible external presidential candidate of high integrity, to accomplish the necessary reforms and bring back stability and credibility to FIFA.\" \n___ \n3:20 p.m. \nFIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has \"unequivocally denied\" any wrongdoing after being suspended for 90 days over allegations of a deal for black market sales of tickets to 2014 World Cup matches. \nA statement from Valcke's lawyer, Barry Berke, says the Frenchman was the subject of \"false allegations.\" It said Valcke \"is confident that when all the facts come out, it will be clear that he did absolutely nothing wrong or improper in carrying out his duties for the good of FIFA and the sport.\" \nValcke was banned along with FIFA President Sepp Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini on Thursday, although over separate allegations. \n___ \n3:10 p.m. \nIssa Hayatou has ruled himself out as a permanent successor to Sepp Blatter and says he has taken over as acting president of FIFA \"amid extraordinary circumstances.\" \nSepp Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini have been suspended for 90 days by FIFA. \nIn a statement released by FIFA, Hayatou says he will only take over the top job on an interim basis and not stand in the emergency presidential election on Feb. 26. \nThat finally ended speculation about Hayatou, a FIFA senior vice president under Blatter and head of the African soccer confederation, becoming a candidate. \nHayatou also says that FIFA will \"continue to cooperate fully with authorities and follow the internal investigation wherever it leads.\" \nHayatou, who is from Cameroon, replaces Blatter temporarily because of his position as the longest-serving current member of FIFA's executive committee. \n___ \n3 p.m. \nFIFA vice president David Gill and fellow executive committee member Wolfgang Niersbach have called for an emergency meeting of FIFA's ruling body to be held. \nAccording to a statement from the English Football Association, of which Gill is vice chairman, the FA says \"there will be a meeting of the 54 UEFA nations as soon as next week.\" \nThe FA was one of the first federations to endorse Michel Platini's candidacy for FIFA president, and the English are not withdrawing that backing yet. \n\"At the FA board meeting last week, we decided that remained our position while inquiries into certain allegations were being investigated,\" the FA said. \"We now await the results of both the ethics committee inquiry and the investigation of the Swiss attorney general.\" \n___ \n2:20 p.m. \nWith Sepp Blatter suspended, African soccer leader Isaa Hayatou will serve as acting president of the governing body for the next 90 days. \nFIFA confirmed Thursday that Hayatou gets automatically elevated to the top job as the longest-serving vice president on its executive committee. \nThe 69-year-old Hayatou has ruled African soccer for 27 years. \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nSepp Blatter's lawyer says the FIFA ethics committee failed to follow the proper procedure when it decided to ban him for 90 days. \nRichard Cullen says Blatter was \"disappointed that the ethics committee did not follow the code of ethics and disciplinary code, both of which provide for an opportunity to be heard.\" \nCullen also says the ethics committee based its decision on a \"misunderstanding,\" adding that the Swiss attorney general has not charged Blatter with a crime.
