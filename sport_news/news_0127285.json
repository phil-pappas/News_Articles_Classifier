And for the third straight week, the Wildcats faltered in the second half. Westbrook outscored the Wildcats 24-0 over the final 24 minutes and earned a 40-0 win in Friday night's Class B South game. “I don’t have an answer, I really don’t,” York head coach Randy Small said. “I think I am going to ask the officials if we can forgo halftime and keep playing. (Westbrook) ran the same play 35 times. We stuff it in the first half, and they run over us in the second. I don’t have an answer. They weren’t doing anything different. I can’t understand why we couldn’t stop them in the second half.” The Blue Blazes improved to 3-3 on the season, while York lost its fourth straight game and sits at 1-5 with two games left in the regular season. York’s final two games are at Noble and home against Marshwood, and Small believes the Wildcats have to win both to make the playoffs. York has not missed the tournament since it went 4-5 in 2010. “The playoffs start for us this week, it’s that simple,” Small said. “There’s no more sugarcoating it. We have to win.” Small believes his team can beat Noble and Marshwood and qualify for the postseason. “Absolutely, we can win both games,” he said. “But we can’t win two before we win one. We have to get the next one; it’s as simple as that.” The Wildcats started strong as junior Ryan Daley returned an interception 65 yards for a touchdown. “The kids were excited,” Small said. “It was a great play by Ryan and he ran it back for the score.” Zach Hutchins ran for 201 yards and three touchdowns for Westbrook, while teammate Demante Loureiro ran for 220 yards and two touchdowns. “It’s frustrating,” Small said. “We’ve been in every single game this season. We don’t start slow, we play hard and we compete. I don’t understand it.” Small also praised the defensive play of senior Josh Smith. “He played hard and was very strong up front for us,” Small said. “He took on a lot of blocks and made a lot of tackles.” By Staff Reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:46:25.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
