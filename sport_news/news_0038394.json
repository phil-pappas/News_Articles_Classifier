Ten organizations and 25 boat crews — ranging from high schoolers to university and masters levels — will flock to the largest two-day regatta in the world: 11,000 athletes, 1,900 boats, 300,000-plus spectators. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information. \n\"It's unlike any other event, just the sheer number of people,\" Cheryl Stock of the Albany Rowing Club said. \nLike many others in the area, she's been putting in practices before work. The 5:30 a.m. sessions, including Wednesday in mostly pitch-black conditions on the Hudson, have created intense conditioning and competition as clubs spent around a month in some cases in seat-racing trials. This came after clubs throughout the world, of all ages, learned if they were given slots in September by the HOTC committee . \nAnyone could apply and there are no time requirements. Half of the fields in the 61 events are groups that were invited back after finishing among the top half of their races last year. \nMost of the Albany-area spots were granted by the open lottery system, meaning here's a chance to shine. The goal now is to produce quick enough times to get invited back. \nThat's the challenge in a wicked crowded environment that draws boats from Alabama to Zurich and Zhejiang, China. \nThey will get a chance to eat the customary clam chowder in a bread bowl that can be bought all over town. Some will bring their home training area's river water and bless the Charles. \nAnd then comes the actual racing, which takes place Saturday and Sunday (each boat gets just one race). It's a nefarious, unique three-mile course that includes some right-angle turns, a lot of ducking and weaving — boats are released every 15 seconds — in a fairly narrow river. Rowers (especially coxswains) are known to scour YouTube and the Internet for maps and other visuals. It is not the place anyone wants to find disaster, but it can be had — and quite public, at that. \nMonths of isolated training sessions are rewarded over the weekend with constant foot traffic and bridge gawkers. \n\"It's intimidating and cool at the same time,\" said Emily Ashton of the Albany Rowing Center (who attends Albany Academy for Girls ). \nShe'll be part of a rare local boat that earned a return bid, finishing 11th out of 85 teams last October. But six of the eight girls from last year's crew graduated. \nThe Shaker Rowing Association is enjoying unprecedented participation — two girls' spots honored through the lottery and a couple of boys' vessels awarded after other teams forfeited them. An entry can cost up to $500. Several coaches note this is not the place to simply write a check for novices, because really poor performance can result in future club lottery limitations. \nGetting in shape took constant repetition. Adults have noted giving up sleep, pre-work showers or alcohol. Two masters-level women with ARC had the flu last week. \nShaker's Grace Conroy noted in recent weeks she started training at 5:30 a.m. Her team also practices in the evenings. The group stays at school an hour past the final bell and then a one-way, school-provided bus ride to Albany's Corning Preserve. \n\"I want to give this my best shot,\" Conroy said of all the time in the water. \nSchenectady County Community College reps feel the same way. The program started in 2007 and now will race alongside the Harvards and Yales of the college rowing world. \nThe school believes it is just the second two-year school to get a lottery invite. Coach Cody Rule said the running joke is SCCC \"is the best community college team in the country, regardless of where it goes.\" But he gets serious when noting the school of about 2,700 full-time students \"will race against anyone, anytime, anywhere.\" \nHe said that Wednesday at a brief pep rally on campus. Rule and athletic director Dave Gonzalez introduced the 10 team members, who proudly wore their blue and yellow rowing jerseys. Extra pride came in the form of school support — all of them will attend the race to watch the five (four rowers and a guiding coxswain). \n\"It's great for team morale that we get to be a team there,\" Schenectady coxswain Emma Boersma said. \"We get to create our school's traditions, too, and set the road for the future.\" \nAnd then there are some that can lead the way. \nARC masters coach Bob Tarrant has his women's senior masters four, and also a four-girl boat from Emma Willard . \nLise Hafner of ARC will also get to watch her son, Jeffrey Endler , rowing a boys' single event for Shaker. \nSaratoga will have the most in-house support, earning 10 bids. \n\"You see how big the rowing community really is,\" Shaker's Newton said. \nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.
