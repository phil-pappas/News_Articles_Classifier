RushCard is not paying anyone to believe in anything.\nBecause of a glitch in what was supposed to be an upgrade, legions of people who rely on the debit card have not been able to access their dough, or check their balances, or deposit any money into their accounts since Monday.\nRushCard head honcho Rick Savard, whose company slogan is “It Pays to Believe in Yourself,” said the firm is working to fix the problem.\nBut so far it hasn’t and that — coupled with what appears to be lousy customer service — has got some card-users steaming mad.\nCourtesy Diamond Morton, a new mom, says she has not been able to get any money because of the RushCard issue. Rob Latour/Rob Latour/Invision/AP Russell Simmons created RushCard to give low-income residents access to a credit card. A few more days of waiting is “unacceptable,\" said Diamond Morton, a RushCard account holder since 2011.\n“We trusted him with our money,” she said. “This is ridiculous.”\nMorton, who is a new mom, said she hasn’t been able to retrieve her paycheck — and other customers are even worse off.\n“People are stranded because they can’t put gas in their cars,” she said. “A woman has not been able to pay her rent for the month and may face eviction.”\nOther disgruntled RushCard users weighed in on the company’s Facebook page.\n“I don’t understand if it’s back up and working why we still can’t use our cards yet,” customer Amanda Rhodes wrote. “Then when you try to call it’s like the phone lines aren't even in service.”\nSavard said in a statement they were trying to give the RushCard an upgrade when something went wrong.\n“During this process, many of our customers were adversely affected when the technology that was used to transition their accounts did not work as planned,” he said.\nRushCard was founded in 2003 by hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons to help low-income people who don’t have access to traditional bank accounts and don’t qualify for credit cards.\n“A decade ago, I watched poor and working-class families standing in long lines outside check-cashing stores, waiting for the privilege of paying to cash their paychecks,” Simmons wrote in an August op-ed for the Daily News. “I thought there had to be a better way.”\nRushCard customers can choose from two plans: the Rush Unlimited Plan or the Pay As You Go Plan. There is a $3.95 to $9.95 one-time card fee after signing up, and a $7.95 or $5.95 fee for PIN transactions under the Rush Unlimited Plan.\nRight now, neither works.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:35:48.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
