But they do seem to play with a scowl.\nThat notable difference in style from previous years — it’s not pretty, but it can be effective — was on display Wednesday night when Toronto fell to the Buffalo Sabres 2-1 in a shootout to go to 1-3-2 on the young season.\nOr, if you’re looking for a slightly more positive trend, 1-1-2 in their last four games.\nMatt Moulson scored the shootout winner in the fifth round after 3-on-3 proved again to be exciting, but fruitless.\nJonathan Bernier — challenged earlier this week to do a better job from the start of the game — put in a solid night in the Leafs net as the Sabres carried most of the game.\nP.A. Parenteau — also challenged by coach Mike Babcock to go to the net more — scored his first goal as a Maple Leaf, establishing an early 1-0 lead. Parenteau also scored a shootout goal.\nPlaying with the lead for so long was a new development for this Mike Babcock team that is supposed to play a gritty, puck-possession style. There are times when they do — like the second period. And times when they don’t — like the first and third period when Buffalo dominated.\n“The big thing is they’re listening every day,” Babcock said before the game. “They’ve been great. They try to get better each and every day. That doesn’t guarantee you success.\n“I like the majority of things we’re trying to do, we’ve just had some lapses.”\nEven Sabres coach Dan Bylsma, who’s got his own rebuilding job in front of him, is impressed with what Babcock has done with the Leafs so far.\n“I played for him for two years and coached a lot of games against him,” said Bylsma. “I have a good understanding of what he demands of his team. Every time you play a Mike Babcock team you get it.\n“You’re getting a team that will play in the offensive zone come hell or high water. Playing there, staying there and being aggressive there. That’s what he’s going to grind into his team.”\nBylsma was asked what he expected of Babcock in Toronto.\n“Other than his scowl? A lot better hair than me. Jealous,” said Bylsma. “We all have our idiosyncracies when we’re behind the bench.\n“That scowl is more the way his team is going to play than it is him.”\nBefore the game, there was a lot of chatter about the rivarly between these two teams. Jack Eichel was talked into believing Leafs-Sabres might be bigger than Boston College against Boston University. Bylsma was worried about fans fighting in the stands.\nThere were — uncharacteristically — plenty of empty seats at the First Niagara Center. For a Leafs-Sabres game, that’s a rarity. But it was a mid-week game between two rebuilding teams and many who might have crossed the border to come probably thought it wiser to watch the Blue Jays.\nStill, there were lingering bad feelings about the way Mike Babcock signed with Toronto over the summer after it appeared to many the Sabres had him locked up. Neither Bylsma nor Babcock bit in their pregame scrums on questions related to the summer coaching carousel.\nThe first period — which ended with Toronto up 1-0 — was a mixed blessing for the Leafs. There were a couple of positive steps forward: For once, they opened the scoring. Parenteau’s deflection of a Roman Polak shot at 1:28 meant Toronto scored first in the game for the first time this season.\nAlso, the Sabres didn’t score on their first shot, or their third shot, or, for that matter, any shot that period.\nBabcock had challenged Bernier to get off to a better start, and the goalie responded.\nBut on the downside, the Leafs were outplayed, outhustled and outshot — 12-6. That was a result of the Sabres’ push-back after the Leafs got the early lead. And the Leafs took the only penalty.\nThe second was more even in terms of play and shots, with Buffalo hodling a slight edge, 12-11. But there was no scoring, and few prime scoring chances.\nThe Maple Leafs will be without defenceman Jake Gardiner for Wednesday night’s game against the Buffalo Sabres.\nGardiner, who practised Tuesday, did not accompany the team to Buffalo for the game. Babcock said the defenceman was injured, but did not elaborate\n“I don’t know how serious it is,” said Babcock. “Day-to-day. That usually means 10 days. I don’t know the answers.”\nGardiner had points in two straight games (one goal, one assist). Defenceman Martin Marincin will return to the lineup in Gardiner’s place.\nThe Leafs were also without centre Tyler Bozak, who’ll miss his second straight game with an undisclosed upper body injury. Mark Arcobello replaced Bozak.\nMore on thestar.com\nMarco Estrada breathes life into Blue Jays playoffs hopes again: DiManno\nBlue Jays grind out at-bats to stretch out ALCS: Griffin", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:28:02.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
