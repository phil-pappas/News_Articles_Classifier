In fact, he once reportedly was close to verbally committing to MSU . Verbal commitments are nonbinding until national letters of intent are signed in February.\nThere's a thought that Notre Dame is now in play for both Kareem and Hayes.\nKareem changed his mind so that his mother, Phillicia, will be able to see him play, said his dad, Ken Kareem.\n“I loved Alabama and the atmosphere down there -- it was like no other -- but I understood that he felt a certain kind of way about his mom being able to see him play,’’ Ken Kareem said. “The University of Alabama is a great place. Coach (Nick) Saban talked to us and said he didn’t want him to come down there if he felt like he was going to be missing his mom or was unfocused.\n“He talked to us about that during his official visit. The distance came up in conversation over the last two months. He felt that he wanted his mom to see him play his college ball. Schools that are within four to five hours or less are now the ones we’ve been looking at.’’\nBefore the start of his junior year, Kareem didn’t have any scholarship offers. By this past spring, he had 39 and was named to the Free Press Dream Team .\nHis decommitment came as news to Harrison coach John Herrington this morning.\n“His dad handles everything, but I had a feeling something was going on,’’ Herrington told the Free Press.\nKareem has 15 sacks this season, plus four forced fumbles and four pass deflections in seven games. He has 42 tackles (29 for loss).\n“Being his father, I want him to go to Alabama, but I understood what he felt about his mom,’’ Ken Kareem said.\nHere is Kareem committing to Alabama at his high school in June:\nThe Farmington Harrison High School star announced his commitment to Alabama on an ESPN podcast.
