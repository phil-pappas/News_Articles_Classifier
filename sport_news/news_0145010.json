Prior to last weekend, Johnstown had been lights-out on both offense and defense. Running back Terrell Jones has rushed 49 times for 364 yards and six touchdowns on the ground. Quarterback Jeremy Updyke (39 of 65 passing for 820 yards and ten touchdowns) has a trio of wide receivers that he likes to get the ball to in the passing game. Pittsburgh commit Exree Loe has been explosive through the first four games. Loe has caught 17 passes for 364 yards and six receiving touchdowns. Wide receivers Tavis Price and Theo Tinsley both have over 300 receiving yards and two touchdowns between them. Zack Odum leads the team in tackles with 37 (13 solo). \nSomerset: Their only loss comes to Bedford as well. Running back Jake Heiple averages 104.8 yards per contest and has scored eleven rushing touchdowns so far this season. Wide receiver George Coyle is averaging 27.7 yards per catch (10 catches, 277 yards). Quarterback Dylan Barnes is 29 of 44 passing on the season for 539 yards and four touchdowns. Austin Hemminger (29 tackles, 17 solo) and Ryan Funa (28 tackles, 18 solo) lead the team in tackles. Quarterback Dylan Barnes is averaging 183.8 yards of total offense per game. \nKeys for Johnstown: They probably have put the memory of last week's loss to Bedford behind them. After losing to them 50-13 last year, Johnstown should be chomping at the bit to get some payback this year against Somerset. They'll want to keep Somerset running back Jake Heiple in check even if that means giving Barnes more opportunities to pass the ball. Prior to their loss to Bedford, Heiple had scored seven touchdowns in their first two games. After the Bedford loss, Heiple scored five touchdown's in Somerset's win last week. \nKeys for Somerset: They'll want to limit any big plays for Johnstown wide receiver Exree Loe. That being said, Tavis Price and Theo Tinsley should see some passes thrown their way as well. The dynamic duo of Jake Heiple and Dylan Barnes will be big factors as always on offense. Expect other players on Somerset's offense to step up as well. Somerset will look to make Johnstown one-dimensional (in this case, the passing game) and hopefully force game-changing turnovers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:27:43.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
