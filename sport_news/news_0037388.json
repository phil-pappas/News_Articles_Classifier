Referee Charles Breakspear pointed to the spot after Shrimpers goalkeeper Daniel Bentley clattered into Marley Watkins, seemingly outside the area.Scowen gleefully accepted the opportunity as he stroked his penalty into the bottom left-hand corner of the net.Southend hit back to equalise just 12 minutes later when Myles Weston teed up Anthony Wordsworth to slam home his first goal for the club with a low left-foot drive from 12 yards.Barnsley's Watkins was then brilliantly denied by Bentley before Southend bagged what proved to be the winning goal in the 43rd minute, with Luke Prosser on target for the first time since December 2013.The centre-back was picked out by a deflected header from Weston and slid the ball home at the back post to secure Southend's sixth win in seven games.
