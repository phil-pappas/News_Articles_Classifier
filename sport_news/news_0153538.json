Here, Press Association Sport looks at five key talking points heading into the second Russian Grand Prix. \nSince the last race in Japan, Jenson Button has decided to stay at McLaren. What changed his mind? \nButton looked destined to call time on his world championship-winning career after he admitted the \"joy had gone\" from racing at the back of the field. But only days after crossing the line in 16th in Japan - a race where he had previously never finished outside the top 10 - the Englishman revealed he was seeing out his two-year contract with McLaren. \nWas it a reassuring call from Ron Dennis that swung Button's vote? Or did the promise that his pay rise to a reported Â£11million for 2016 - having taken a pay cut this season - play a part? It is hard to say what changed Button's mind, but it certainly will not be the promise of McLaren racing at the front next year. Based on their awful displays this season, and the stability in regulations over the winter, it is unlikely they will show vast improvement next term. \nAnd Button is not the only driver who has confirmed his plans for 2016 is he? \nNo, Romain Grosjean will lead the newly-formed American outfit Haas next season. Haas will be powered by Ferrari engines and Lotus driver Grosjean will have one eye on replacing Kimi Raikkonen at the Italian team in 2017. Indeed the Frenchman told Press Association Sport last week: \"I believe any driver, and myself particularly, is dreaming to drive for Ferrari one day.\" Who will partner Grosjean remains a mystery, but the Ferrari reserve driver Esteban Gutierrez is the early frontrunner. \nAm I right in saying that Mercedes can seal the constructors' championship on Sunday? \nYes, Mercedes need to score just three more points than Ferrari in Sochi to claim their second team title in as many years. And given their imperious form in Japan last time out, it appears something of an inevitability. A Mercedes car has won 11 of the 14 races this season and started on pole in all but one. They are the class of the field and the rest of the pack, led by Ferrari, face a daunting challenge of catching them over the winter. \nAnd what of the drivers' battle? Nico Rosberg said earlier this week that he has not given up hope of catching Lewis Hamilton \nRosberg has been cast 48 points adrift of his Mercedes team-mate and, with only 125 available, it seems unlikely that the German can stop Hamilton from winning back-to-back crowns. But, to his credit, Rosberg is not giving up. \"We have five races to go and, although the championship gap to Lewis is quite big, in my mind it's definitely not over yet,\" he said heading into this weekend's race. It is a commendable attitude, but it is an outcome which seems improbable. Hamilton has dominated his team-mate, and has rarely put a foot wrong this season. It just seems a matter of when, rather than if, he will win this year's championship. \nBernie Ecclestone reckons Formula One will have new owners by the end of the year - what is the likelihood of that happening? \nIt is almost impossible to predict whether Ecclestone, notorious for twisting the truth to suit his gains, is really telling it as it is. Ecclestone, who turns 85 later this month, reckons there are three suitors in line to buy the sport. Whatever the outcome, you fancy Ecclestone has no interest in relinquishing his position as the sport's chief executive.
