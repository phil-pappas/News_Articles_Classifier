Tejada had to be carried off the field. \nTejada batted .261 with a .688 OPS this season and was the team's starting shortstop entering the postseason . \nThe Mets will now have to replace him. Wilmer Flores will become the team's starting shortstop. Matt Reynolds will take his place on the roster . He has never played in the majors. \nTo make room for Reynolds on the 40-man roster, the Mets designated pitcher Tim Stauffer for assignment. \nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com .
