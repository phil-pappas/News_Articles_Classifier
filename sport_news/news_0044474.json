Court papers show 42-year-old Perry Thompson admits to being friends with the child, but denies any sexual abuse.\nThe Orange County Special Investigations Unit arrested Thompson Friday. Investigators say he started assaulting the 16-year-old in 2012, when the alleged victim was 13. The teen tells police he had more than 100 sexual encounters with Thompson during that time. The alleged assaults happened at the teen's grandparents' house in Orange and at Thompson's residence in Barre.\n\"Mr. Thompson was charged today with felony aggravated sexual assault of a child. The filing of information and the finding of probable cause are not evidence of his guilt. He is presumed innocent and remains so throughout the process unless and until he's proven guilty at trial,\" said Dickson Corbett, Orange County Deputy State's Attorney.\nAnd the accused child sex predator worked for the Vermont Agency of Education. He was the administrative assistant to Education Secretary Rebecca Holcombe and the board of education. He just marked his second year on the job. He's now on administrative leave.\nCourt papers show Thompson also reffed high school and college football and coached youth basketball.\nThe Agency of Education released a statement regarding Thompson's arrest saying ...\n\"We are shocked and disturbed by the allegations. The employee has been relieved of his duties. At this point, we are letting law enforcement do their full and thorough investigation. We appreciate their professionalism and are cooperating fully to support the investigation. We have very little information at this time. Any new information will come from those investigating authorities.\"\nCourt papers show in 2013 there was an investigation involving the Vermont State Police and the Department for Children and Families looking into Thompson. DCF declined to comment on the case, but court papers show authorities discovered suspicious Facebook messages between Thompson and the victim in December 2012. The paperwork also indicates that Thompson admits being friendly with the alleged victim, but denies the sexually abusing him.\nThompson is due back in court in December. He's currently out on bail.\nRelated Stories:\nBerlin man accused of child sex assault", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:51:36.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
