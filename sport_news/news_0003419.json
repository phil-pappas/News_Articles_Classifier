I was completely suicidal, I didn't want to live any more. I thought that I was completely alone.\n\"I also realised how lucky I was, and what a wonderful family and wonderful friends I had, but that didn't matter. I wanted the world to swallow me up, and nothing seemed better to me than death.\"\nDelevigne credits her good friend Kate Moss for \"picking me up off the floor\".\n\"What happened was I eventually said no, and I eventually took a break, from the advice of Kate Moss, who kind of picked me up off the floor. It's about finding people around you who have your best interests at heart.\n\"I had a lot of people around me who were just after what I gave them... not looking after me. So it's about finding people who care about you, and support you. And I've now been able to become a support for other people, as well,\" she said.\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Hollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Hollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Hollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Cara Delevingne Practices Her American Accent: ''It's Better When I Have a Few Drinks'' - TOI", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/XoQlC-bqaQk", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:27:47.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
