(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) × COLUMBIA — There was no Head Ball Coach on the sideline, but South Carolina did find something else — a rare win over an SEC opponent. Pharoh Cooper streaked for a 78-yard touchdown in the third quarter, and the Gamecocks forced five turnovers Saturday as South Carolina beat Vanderbilt 19-10 at Williams-Brice Stadium to earn its first conference victory of the season. The game was also the first for USC under interim head coach Shawn Elliott, who took over after Steve Spurrier resigned in the wake of his worst first half of a season at South Carolina. South Carolina (3-4, 1-4 SEC) entered having won just one of its previous nine conference games — the exception being the miracle overtime victory at Florida last season — since winning at Vanderbilt a year ago. The Commodores (2-4, 0-3) held a halftime lead against an SEC opponent for the first time in nearly three seasons, but lost their 11th consecutive league game. Tailback Brandon Wilds returned after missing three straight games with bruised ribs, and went over the century mark in rushing yards for the second time this season. The Gamecocks trailed midway through the third quarter, but quarterback Perry Orth found Cooper over the middle on a slant route for a completion the receiver turned into the go-ahead score. South Carolina added four field goals from Elliott Fry, who connected from 47, 31, 19 and 22 yards. Fry also missed a 39-yard attempt off the right upright, and hooked a 55-yarder right on the final play of the first half. Chris Lammons, Skai Moore and Bryson Allen-Williams intercepted Vanderbilt quarterback Johnny McCrary, and Allen-Williams also forced a field goal when he stopped tailback Ralph Webb on third down near the goal line in the third quarter. Moore and T.J. Holloman recovered fumbles, but Holloman was later ejected for targeting after breaking up a third-down pass with what officials deemed a helmet-to-helmet hit. Vanderbilt led 7-6 at halftime, and a 41-yard rush by Darrius Sims put the Commodores in positon to go up two scores early in the third quarter. But Allen-Williams stopped Webb for no gain on third-and-2 from the 5, forcing Vanderbilt to settle for a field goal. Three plays later, Orth found Cooper for the touchdown which put USC back in front. South Carolina’s defense took it from there. Lammons’ interception ended one Vanderbilt threat, a Moore pickoff led to another Fry field goal, and Moore recovered a McCrary fumble in the final minutes after the Commodores had reached the South Carolina 24.
