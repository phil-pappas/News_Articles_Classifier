Even a franchise-best 12-0-1 points streak to finish last season wasn't enough to get them into the playoffs. \nZuccarello started the scoring late in a hard-hitting, fast-paced first period. Gregory Campbell couldn't reach a short pass from David Savard deep in the Columbus end. Zuccarello scooped up the loose puck near the crease and flipped a backhand shot past Bobrovsky. \nAtkinson pulled Columbus even at the midpoint of the second period. He scored on a breakaway on a nifty move for his first goal on a long pass from Brandon Dubinsky from his knees. \nNOTES: The teams play again Saturday night at Madison Square Garden.
