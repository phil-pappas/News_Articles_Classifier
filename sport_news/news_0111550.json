(AP) â€” \nCyle Larin scored twice in an 8-minute span in the second half and Orlando City beat New York City FC 2-1 on Friday night to keep its playoff hopes alive. Orlando City (12-13-8) has won five straight games to move within a point of sixth-place Montreal for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Kwame Watson-Siriboe gave New York City (10-16-7) a 1-0 lead in the second minute of first-half stoppage time. Mix Diskerud's shot from distance deflected off a crowd in front of goal and Watson-Siriboe one-touched the loose ball into the back of the net. Larin tied it in the 62nd minute after heading in Corey Ashe's cross. Eight minutes later, Larin made it 2-1 on a counter-attack. Larin fed Adrian Winter on a two-on-one, but Winter's shot was blocked by Josh Saunders. Winter was first to the loose ball and found an open Larin in front of goal for an easy tap in. Larin was inches away from a third goal in the 74th, but defenseman Jefferson Mena stopped it at a goal line.
