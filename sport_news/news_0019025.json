(AP) - Mississippi Power Co. customers have until Oct. 30 to decide if they want refunds as a bill credit or a check.\nThe unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. must repay more than $377 million it collected for its Kemper County power plant between April 2013 and July 2015.\nThe state Supreme Court ordered refunds after it found the 2013 rate increase was illegal.\nUnder a process approved by the Public Service Commission, current customers who don't act will get bill credits, expected to average about $650. Beginning Monday, those who want a check can choose that option online, by phone or at a company office.\nThe utility will mail checks to the last known address of former customers.\nMississippi Power says it's borrowing the refund money from parent Southern Co.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
