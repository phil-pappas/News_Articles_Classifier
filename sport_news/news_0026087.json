Four games at once were played on the field surface, which was divided into four equal smaller fields, which made for fast action and lots of scoring opportunities \nThe event was sponsored by the Central Maine Board of Field Hockey Officials and proceeds go to the Gail Santerre Development Fund for officials who want to progress in their abilities. \nThe teams who participated were Oceanside of Rockland/Thomaston, Camden Hills of Rockport, Belfast, Mount View of Thorndike, Lawrence of Fairfield A and B, Hall-Dale of Farmingdale, Boothbay Region, Mount Blue of Farmington, Erskine Academy of South China, Morse of Bath, Mount Ararat of Topsham A and B, Gardiner and Maine Central Institute of Pittsfield. \nFor the Midcoast teams, Oceanside finished 3-1 with 13 goals for and nine against for nine points. The Mariners were fifth. \nThe complete results for each team, with record, goals-for, goals-against and points listed were: Gardiner, 4-0, 17-2, 12 points; Lawrence \"B,\" 4-0, 19-7, 12 points; MCI, 3-1, 14-7, 9 points; Lawrence \"A,\" 3-1, 12-5, 7 points; Oceanside, 3-1, 13-9, 9 points; Mount Ararat \"B,\" 3-1, 9-9, 9 points; Morse 2-1-1, 15-9, 7 points; Hall-Dale, 2-1-1, 13-9, 7 points; Mount Ararat \"A,\" 1-3, 7-10, 3 points; Mount View, 1-3, 9-14, 3 points; Erskine Academy, 1-3, 8-13, 3 points; Mount Blue, 1-3, 5-13, 3 points; Belfast, 1-3, 7-17, 3 points; Boothbay 0-4, 4-15, no points; and Camden Hills, 0-4, 1-14, no points. \nComplete scores and other information can be found by clicking here .
