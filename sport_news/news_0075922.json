But memories of a three-game win streak crashing down last October in Philadelphia thanks to a 27-0 shellacking remain fresh. \nEagles: This has been an uneven start after a tumultuous off-season in which Chip Kelly parted ways with numerous franchise mainstays, including LeSean McCoy, Evan Mathis and Jeremy Maclin. All that said, if the Eagles can beat the Giants, they'll move a half-game ahead of the Cowboys, who have a bye, and into first place.\nKey matchup \nGiants LT Ereck Flowers vs. Eagles DL Fletcher Cox. The versatile Cox recorded the first three-sack game of his career against the Saints last week, forcing Drew Brees to fumble twice. Expect Cox to battle Flowers for much of the game. \nHow they'll win \nGiants: The Giants took Buffalo's intimidating defensive front out of the game with quick passes from Eli Manning and precision routes. Manning averages 2.26 seconds to release the ball, the fourth-quickest in the NFL, according to Pro Football Focus. Expect more of the same to keep the Eagles at bay. Manning has 10 touchdowns and two interceptions, completing 66.5 percent of his passes. He'll likely have Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle in the lineup despite hamstring issues for both. Last year vs. the Eagles, Beckham was targeted a staggering 21 times in Week 17 , finishing with 12 catches for 185 yards and a TD. This could be another game where RB Shane Vereen and TE Larry Donnell exploit matchups. CB Jayron Hosley will step in for Prince Amukamara and newly signed Brandon McGee was promoted from the practice squad Sunday. MLB Jon Beason's expected return from a concussion should help fortify the league's No. 2 run defense. Special teams has been outstanding with tremendous contributions from K Josh Brown, P Brad Wing and coverage teams that have forced the opposition into an average starting field position of 20.21, tops in the NFL. \nEagles: QB Sam Bradford has been very inconsistent with eight touchdowns and six interceptions, and he'll be without one of his best targets in rookie Nelson Agholor (ankle). The Giants are last in pass defense, however, meaning Bradford should be able to attack with WR Jordan Matthews and Riley Cooper. TE Zach Ertz is in line for a big game. Ryan Mathews, the Eagles' top rusher, is questionable with a groin injury. That should lead to more opportunities for former Cowboys star DeMarco Murray, who showed positive signs last week with 83 rushing yards. The Giants have allowed 321 receiving yards to running backs this season, third-most in the NFL, so expect Darren Sproles to cause them plenty of headaches. K Caleb Sturgis has missed a pair of extra points in two games since he was signed to replace Cody Parkey, who went on IR. The Giants have protected the football extremely well, but expect the Eagles to try to pressure Manning into mistakes.\nâ€” Art Stapleton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:36.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
