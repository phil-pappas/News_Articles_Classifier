No Asian player or club featured in the nominations compiled by FIFA and France Football magazine. English and Italian players also failed to make the list. \nMessi was joined by Brazilian Neymar and Luis Suarez of Uruguay giving Barcelona its complete forward line on the list. Barcelona, which won La Liga, the Champions League and domestic cup last year, has the most players on the shortlist with Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta, Argentine defender Javier Mascherano and Croatian Ivan Rakitic joining its front three on the list. \nReal Madrid has five players with Karim Benzema of France, Wales’ Gareth Bale, Colombian James Rodriguez and German Toni Kroos also named alongside Portugal’s Ronaldo. \nGerman champion Bayern Munich also has five representatives with Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Mueller, Arjen Robben, Arturo Vidal and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. \nApart from Vidal, Copa America champion Chile also has Alexis Sanchez nominated, plus coach Jorge Sampaoli on the 10-man list of nominees for coach of the year. \nThe winners will be announced on January 11 at a ceremony in Zurich. The list of Ballon d’Or nominees will be shortened to the final three contenders on November 30 with Messi and Ronaldo almost certain to make the cut. \nDespite neither winning a major national team title, Messi and Ronaldo have shared the Ballon d’Or since 2008. Messi has won four awards and Ronaldo three, including in 2013 and 2014. \nSampaoli is competing with nine coaches of European clubs, including Luis Enrique of Barcelona and Jose Mourinho of English champion Chelsea. \nVoting is by national team coaches and captains, plus a selected journalist, from each of FIFA’s 209 member federations. Polling closes on November 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:43:25.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
