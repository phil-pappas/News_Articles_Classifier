( Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer ) The Boulder-based Bicycle Product Suppliers Association is coordinating the effort to replace a commonly used part on bikes with disc brakes, over concerns that the quick release lever can come into contact with the brakes during a ride, causing a crash.\nSpecific models weren't named in a recall notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, but bikes affected date back as far as 1998 for some brands.\nRay Keener, BPSA's executive director, said every effort is being made to inform consumers and retailers.\n\"We've mailed posters to every bike shop in America telling them what to do,\" Keener said. \"New parts are being produced and shipped to retailers to replace the quick releases.\nAdvertisement \"We're doing the best we can to get the message out.\"\nA web site, quickreleaserecall.com , has been created to address frequently asked questions and information on what consumers can do. A video has also been made available demonstrating how to determine if a bike is subject to recall. It can be accessed via the web site.\nBicycles most likely to be affected are mountain bikes and hybrid bikes, because they often utilize disc brakes, said Jeffrey Justice, manager of Longmont's Bike-N-Hike, 1136 Main St.\nYour bike might be affected if your bike has a \"round, metal disc in the hub of the wheel,\" Justice said. \"If you have the little brake pads that hits the rims,\" it's not a disc brake bike.\nJustice's shop has been replacing quick releases for a few months on Trek bikes. Trek was the first company to issue a recall, in late April, after investigating an injury.\nThe Wisconsin-based company found three cases relating to the quick release defect, including one incident that resulted in quadriplegia.\nKeener said no injuries have been reported to any of the brands involved in this current recall effort.\nTrek, in its recall notice, said the issue is not a manufacturer defect but is due to improper use or adjustment of the quick release. The CPSC recall notice did not make that distinction, and Keener declined to comment.\nSeveral local bike shop workers confirmed that the quick release would only cause problems as a result of user error.\n\"The danger only comes when people don't use the quick release properly,\" Justice said.\nThat's because the part can open 180 degrees and get caught in the brake, added Kevin Cappon, a sales associate at Boulder Cycle Sport.\n\"If you can operate without putting the part in position where it's going to fail, you're able to work through the problem rather than create the problem.\"\nBut, Cappon admitted, the everyday bike rider would need to be \"minimally mechanically inclined\" to use the part correctly. That responsibility, he said, ultimately falls on the bike shops.\n\"I don't blame people for not being able to use it correctly,\" he said. \"This is a job for the bike stores, a diligence issue that falls on us.\n\"It would behoove people to visit their local bike shop and ask for brief tutorial as a refresher. We're going to be more than happy to help people.\"\nJustice echoed that.\n\"We will and have used the recall as an educational opportunity,\" he said. \"In Longmont or anywhere around here, we'd be glad to show people the correct and safe use for their bike.\"\nShay Castle: 303-473-1626, castles@dailycamera.com , @shayshinecastle", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1008/20151008__09dcbbikw~2_200.jpg", "http://quickreleaserecall.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:03:02.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
