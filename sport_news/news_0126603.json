The players learned they were always the youngest on their club teams because they played up in age level. They also discovered they had competed against one another while playing YMCA ball when they were about 8 years old.\nThe bond has been instrumental in why Potts and Trawick are the Greater San Antonio area’s most productive 1-2 attacking combination. Both junior outside hitters, the duo this season has combined for 1,105 kills - Potts has an area-leading 575 kills, while Trawick has 530, which ranks No. 2.\nFor more, check out ExpressNews.com .", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755619/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755621/15/920x920.jpg", "http://www.expressnews.com/sports/high_school/high_school_volleyball/article/Double-Trouble-6571074.php", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755613/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755618/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755620/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755620/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755616/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/26/8750511/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755613/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755616/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755614/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755621/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755619/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/26/8750504/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755614/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/26/8750504/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/46/8755618/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/26/8750511/13/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:28:44.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
