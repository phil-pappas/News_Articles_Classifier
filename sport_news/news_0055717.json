The Frenchman submitted his candidacy prior to the suspension and it will be reconsidered if he is reinstated prior to the vote in February. \nIn addition to Platini, former FIFA vice-president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, former Trinidad and Tobago player David Nakhid and Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa are expected to stand. \nSalman's potential candidacy would not be without controversy, however, given a number of questions he faces about human rights abuses in his native Bahrain, specifically related to the pro-democracy uprising in 2011. Salman has denied the allegations. \nFIFPro's statement said the new FIFA president must be able to show \"a body of work based on social well being, fairness, democratic values on human rights\". \n\"The future leader of FIFA has to be a proven reformer, an impeccable figure who passes the most stringent integrity tests (underpinned by the highest standards of ethical behaviour and honesty), carried out independently, possibly by more than one external body,\" the statement said.
