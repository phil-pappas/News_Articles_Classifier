Peace was in a fight for the Lakers' final roster spot with Jabari Brown. However, after showing in training camp and preseason that his veteran presence could be a valued assest, the team decided to keep him over the younger guard. \nAt 36 years old, Peace is well past his prime and will probably not play that often. Still, he has become a mentor for Julius Randle , pushing and advising the young Lakers forward at every opportunity. After missing all of last season due to a leg injury and with Peace in his corner, Randle has played quite well in preseason and is expected to take a larger role with the Lakers this season. \nPeace will just be nothing more than a glorified coach this season, but this seems like the perfect way for him to end his career. A career that was unfortunately filled with glaring low points may now be able to end on a very high point. \nMetta World Peace is back in the NBA.
