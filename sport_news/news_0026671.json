After winning the third set, it was so much fun,” Senior Addison Swift led the Demons with 36 assists, and senior Maddie Robertson added 14 kills. “After the third set, the offense started clicking and our defense was all over the floor,” said Vogt. “Tonight was a real team effort.” Senior Sarah Waller had 10 kills, junior Josie Surmeier had six blocks and senior Leah Stephens added four blocks for Durango. “Our junior varsity played great tonight, too,” said Vogt. “Our program is full of a bunch of wonderful kids, I’m proud to be their coach.” Durango takes on Grand Junction (3-11, 2-4) Central at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at Durango High School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:55:44.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
