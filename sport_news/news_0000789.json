Fallon’s skills have developed at a high rate and he will be one of four members for Team Georgia at the Smokey Mountain Showdown Trout Legend Cup which will be held in Cherokee and Bryson City, N.C. on Oct. 17. The event will be hosted by Trout Legend which is the organization that ranks competitive fly fishermen in the United States.“I’ve been involved in fishing since I could walk,” Fallon said. “My first time fishing was on a family trip and I tagged along with my older brothers because I wasn’t old enough to cast. I’ve enjoyed fishing in freshwater and saltwater but enjoy the challenge of fly fishing.”Fallon has also been selected as one of 10 members of the United State Youth Fly Fishing Team which will compete at the World Championships in Spain in July 2016.“Making Team USA has been the highlight of my career,” Fallon said.Earning awards in competition isn’t Fallon’s only motivation to fishing. “My favorite aspects of the sport are being on the river with friends,” he said. “I enjoy the challenge and the opportunity to always improve.”Fallon lists the Nantahala River and the Chattahoochee River below the Buford Dam as his favorite local spots for fishing.“I plan to continue competitively in fly fishing throughout college,” Fallon said.He’s also active on the ball field for Holy Innocents’ as a player on both the football and lacrosse teams. Off the field, Fallon is a member of the school’s Outdoors Club as well as the Global Citizenship Program. He’s a member of the National Science Honor Society and an Honor Student at Holy Innocents’.Fallon is also a Life Scout in Boy Scout Troop 370, which is sponsored by St. James United Methodist Church, working towards the rank of Eagle Scout.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:43:57.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
