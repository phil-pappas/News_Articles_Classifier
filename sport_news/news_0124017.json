(AP) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer says algae blooms are becoming a big problem in bodies of water around New York state and that the federal government needs to take action.\nThe Democrat said Wednesday that he's urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture to boost funding for programs that aim to reduce phosphorus runoff from farms that feed the algae.\nState figures show that there have been 126 blue-green algae blooms in 87 bodies of water in upstate New York so far this year, a number which Schumer says is close to a record. The algae can worsen water quality, prompt beach closures and sicken fish, wildlife, pets and even humans who swim in or drink the water.\nSchumer says aging wastewater systems are another factor, as occasional sewage overflows can promote algae growth.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
