Boone was not fined by the league and no penalty was called. \nSeattle defensive end Michael Bennett got a personal foul for knocking down and diving on Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton during a Seahawks interception return, and that cost Bennett $20,000. \nDenver DE Malik Jackson was docked $17,363 for a horse-collar tackle against Oakland. Pittsburgh DE Cam Heyward was fined $5,787 for displaying a personal message with his eye black. \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
