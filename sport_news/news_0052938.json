Butler/NBAE/Getty Images\nAdChoices OAKLAND — Much is right with the Golden State Warriors’ world as they enter the season as reigning NBA champions.\nBut rewind the tape one season to when there was talk the Warriors might trade Klay Thompson to the Minnesota Timberwolves for big man Kevin Love. That never came to fruition, and after Thompson, now 25, signed last October for four years and roughly $70 million, he began the season with a blistering encore-dropping 41 points on the Los Angeles Lakers in the home opener and averaged a league-leading 29.7 points through the season’s first three games.\nThose numbers would eventually settle, but in 77 games last year, Thompson put up a career-high 21.7 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game while averaging 31.9 minutes.\nBut the NBA is a league of sustainability, and Thompson’s teammate, Andre Iguodala, was the first to mention this as it relates to Thompson.\n\"As (last) season went on, I think (Thompson) wore down a little bit, mentally more than anything,\" Iguodala says. \"I think he was just trying to get with himself instead of just letting it come to him. But I’ll take the good of that where he holds himself to a high standard, wants to play at a high level, wants to be the best shooting guard in this league.\"\nThere’s nothing like a word of caution and reason from a veteran such as Iguodala, whose story of coming off the bench for the first time in his career last season became the rallying cry of sacrifice for that championship team. But Iguodala’s realism toward Thompson’s future helps balance the instant gratification many fall into as they watch such a prolific shooter’s career develop.\nIguodala says Thompson will mature with each year but just needs to avoid burning out in February or March as Iguodala thinks he did last season.\nThompson enjoyed his improved individual performances last season but puts those accomplishments aside, touting a pragmatic, overall team view of success this season.\n\"(Last year) I was able to get some great individual accolades, but even better, you sacrifice for your team, and we all have one common goal (this season), and that is to hoist the Larry O’Brien Trophy again,\" Thompson says.\nIs it outlandish to think Thompson could bring home his own league MVP award this season, solidifying the claim he and Stephen Curry are the best shooting backcourt in NBA history? The two started last year’s All-Star Game together, Thompson’s first appearance among the league’s creme de la creme.\nThompson also set an NBA record for points in one quarter against the Sacramento Kings on Jan. 23 when he dropped 37 in the third, before finishing with a career-high 52. That came against a poor defense, but nonetheless, Thompson put on full display his unconscious shooting potential as he went 16-for-25 from the floor, including 11-for-15 from three-point range.\nDespite all the milestones, Thompson is quick to dismiss his individual goals going into the new season and would rather focus on what he can control on the court each day.\n\"I don’t really think MVP or All-NBA at all,\" says Thompson, a third-team All-NBA selection last season. \"I just think if you play your hardest every day and get your work in, all that will take care of itself.\"\nThompson knows his rebounding numbers need to increase, and the shooting guard also would like to improve on both sides of the ball.\nBut improvements aside, the fifth-year star’s mere court presence remains vital, teammate Harrison Barnes says.\n\"Klay’s a huge part of our team, not only when he’s scoring the basketball and he’s driving and creating lanes, but just his ability to sit in on the wing and attract attention,\" Barnes says. \"No one’s going to leave Klay. And if you do, it’s a wide-open three-point shot.\"\nAnd that’s bad news for NBA defenses, because Thompson ranked fourth in the league at 44% from beyond the arc.\n\"(Thompson’s) ability to move off the ball this year, I know that’s something that Coach has talked to him about. It will only make him that much better,\" Barnes says.\nBarnes, Thompson, Curry, Andrew Bogut and Draymond Green combined as the second-best starting five in NBA history last year behind only the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls. The unit went 50-7 when collectively starting games.\nGreen sees even more potential for Thompson and speaks confidently of his ability to realize his gifts.\n\"He’s one of those guys (who can reach another level),\" Green says. \"Klay, he’s 25, and I think he can continue to get better as well, and I think he’s going to continue to get better.\"\nAt times last season, the Warriors offense would seemingly rely on Curry for much of the team’s playmaking and to bail them out of rare scoring lulls. This season, Thompson says he needs to step into that playmaking role in addition to earning more trips to the free throw line.\nAccording to new Warriors big man Jason Thompson, Klay Thompson’s court presence allows him spacing and open looks. In addition, after the Warriors comfortably swept Jason Thompson’s former team — the Kings — last season 4-0, it will be nice for the former Rider star to actually suit up with the likes of Klay Thompson and Curry.\n\"It’s definitely good to be on the same team and to be on defense and not have to worry about those guys,\" Jason Thompson says. \"So as bigs, there’s going to be a lot of openings, especially when they’re coming off screens and getting doubled.\"\nKlay Thompson’s 2014-15 production tailed off a bit in the playoffs as his averages dipped to 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.6 assists.\nHis three-point shooting percentage also dropped to 39% throughout the playoffs.\nBut his running mates know Thompson’s upside and how lethal he can be.\n\"I’m definitely looking forward to continue to build with him,\" Iguodala says. \"He really only can take a step forward coming from where he left off a bit.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:16:45.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
