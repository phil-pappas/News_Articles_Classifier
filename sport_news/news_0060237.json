The change will be postponed again if weather interferes. C.M. GUERRERO cmguerrero@elnuevoherald.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nA new construction project on State Road 836, the Dolphin Expressway, will affect traffic patterns, beginning Sunday. \nThe project, which will cost $149.5 million and take three years to complete, involves widening of the toll road by one lane and reconstruction of interchanges from NW 57 th Avenue east to NW 27 th Avenue, officials said. \nThe announcement of the new project comes as the $560-million reconstruction of the massive interchange between 836 and State Road 826, the Palmetto Expressway, is winding down. Expected to be completed in 2016, the 836-826 project still has several components under construction and traffic pattern changes coming, including a major one this weekend. \nBeginning early Sunday, westbound traffic will be shifted onto a new roadway between NW 57 th and NW 87 th Avenues. The change will be postponed again if weather interferes. \nThe 836 widening and interchange reconstruction project is being financed with revenue from tolls. The MDX board of directors last year approved a new toll program under which drivers pay a toll no matter where they enter the expressway on 836. Previously, drivers did not have to pay a toll on long stretches of the road.
