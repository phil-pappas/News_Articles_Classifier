The loss moves the Crunch to 2-3-0-0 on the season, with all three losses in a row. The Comets also sit at 2-3-0-0 and take a 1-0 lead in the 10-game season series. Crunch goaltender Allen York stopped 22 of 26 in his first start for Syracuse this season. Cannata earned his first shutout of the season, turning aside all 30 shots. Syracuse was unable to convert on six power play opportunities, while Utica went 2-for-7 on the man-advantage. The Comets opened the scoring and went on to build up a two-goal lead before the end of the first period. Brendan Gaunce struck on the rebound off assists from Jordan Subban and Nicklas Jensen at the 4:12 mark. Just after the halfway point of the frame, Blair Jones chipped one past York while on the power play to put Syracuse down 2-0. Subban earned his second point of the night on the play. Alex Friesen recorded the secondary assist. Utica lit the lamp again with a power-play goal with 5:18 remaining in the second period. Linden Vey received a pass from Alex Biega and fired a wrist shot from the right circle to send Utica up 3-0. Just 1:35 into the third, the Comets added another tally. On an odd-man rush, Wacey Hamilton threw a cross-slot feed for Hunter Shinkaruk to one-time into the back of the net. The secondary assist went to John Negrin. Syracuse will complete its first three-in-three of the season at Rochester on Sunday at 5:05 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:20:33.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
