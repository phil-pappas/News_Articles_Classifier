We’re really excited to win this meet.” \nThe Lions may be winning it for some time to come. Their first three runners behind DiMarcello are all freshmen – Ellie DiMarcello, sixth in 19:40; Angela Kearsley, ninth in 19:56; and Brenna Talamo, 10th in 20:09. Then came juniors Erin Kelley (13th, 20:13) and Emelia Maslanka (17th, 20:45) and senior Emily Ehrhart (21st, 21:04). \n“We ran really hard today; it was nice to be in a competitive race again,” DiMarcello said. \nThe 1-5 spread of 52 seconds is pretty strong. \nNote just the one senior. North may be on the verge of launching a Voorhees-esque H/W/S dynasty – the Vikings won every county meet between 2002 and 2012. \nAnna DiMarcello ran the kind of smart race a leader of a team like the Lions could be expected to do. \n“I just wanted to stay with the top pack and finish in the top three,” she said. “On this course, you have to use the downhills to your advantage, because there’s almost no flat – it’s all up or down. I like running on the uphills.” \nNow the Lions will pursue the Skyland Conference title next Thursday at Natirar Park in Somerset County. \n“Winning this meet gives us a lot of momentum going into the Skyland meet,” Anna DiMarcello said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:51:56.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
