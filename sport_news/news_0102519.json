They're also thought to be safer because riders and drivers share identifying information about themselves digitally before the ride begins, and all payments are handled within the app.\nOpen the airports to Uber Editorial Board Mayor Rahm Emanuel is ready to take down the roadblocks that keep Uber, Lyft and other ride-share companies from picking up passengers at Chicago's airports.\nThat's good news for customers who want to bypass that long taxi line at O'Hare, and for the freelance drivers who are eager to pick them...\nMayor Rahm Emanuel is ready to take down the roadblocks that keep Uber, Lyft and other ride-share companies from picking up passengers at Chicago's airports.\nThat's good news for customers who want to bypass that long taxi line at O'Hare, and for the freelance drivers who are eager to pick them...\n(Editorial Board) Innovative. Popular. But profoundly unfair to the men and women who have worked hard and played by the rules that govern traditional taxi service.\nFor instance, taxi drivers have to study for and obtain a chauffeur's license, which requires drug and background testing. Uber drivers, which I'll use going forward in the generic sense, only have to have ordinary driver's licenses.\nTaxi drivers have to buy or lease a city medallion — a once-expensive permit designed to limit the number of cabs on the street. Uber drivers labor under no such restrictions.\nTaxi drivers may charge only fares that are strictly regulated by the city. Uber drivers use a \"surge pricing\" model in which fares are higher, often dramatically so, when bad weather, major events or other factors increase the demand for their services.\nTaxi drivers have to pay more than $1,500 in special annual fees per vehicle. Uber drivers don't.\nTaxi drivers can't park their vehicles on residential streets. Uber drivers can.\nTaxi vs. ride-share at city budget hearings John Byrne The taxi vs. ride-share controversy played out at City Council budget hearings Friday, with supporters of both sides crowding into the chambers at City Hall to applaud and boo as aldermen pressed a city commissioner to justify the Emanuel administration's regulation of the competing industries.\n... The taxi vs. ride-share controversy played out at City Council budget hearings Friday, with supporters of both sides crowding into the chambers at City Hall to applaud and boo as aldermen pressed a city commissioner to justify the Emanuel administration's regulation of the competing industries.\n... (John Byrne) Additionally, taxi drivers are subjected to stricter insurance, vehicle inspection and vehicle age standards than Uber drivers are.\nThese sorts of discrepancies have provoked protests and even mini-riots around the world, and for very understandable reasons.\nI can't and won't defend all the regulations on conventional taxis.\nThe medallion requirement, for instance, strikes me as anti-competitive and therefore protectionist. It's regrettable that some drivers and companies have in the past invested up to $300,000 per medallion and that eliminating the requirement would make that investment instantly worthless. But the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents some Chicago cabbies, says that all the competition from ride-sharing companies has already sapped most of the value from the medallions.\nThe ban on surge pricing for conventional taxis is also anti-competitive and hard to justify. Transparency in pricing — making sure passengers know the fare before they get in the car — is far more important than consistency.\nSimilarly, the special licensing requirement for cabbies seems unnecessary. A good, not necessarily perfect, driving record would suffice.\nYet some of the regulations make sense. Enhanced vehicle safety inspections and robust liability insurance are the sorts of common-sense consumer protections that ought to be in place.\nEither way, though, taxi drivers and Uber drivers offer very similar services and ought to be covered by very similar rules.\nIf Uber drivers gain access to city airports — where local cabbies now earn a reported 20 percent of their income — then taxi drivers should be unleashed from the regulations that make it difficult for them to compete with Uber there and on all other fronts.\nThe protests will end only when the law strikes a fair balance.\nSo, soon, I hope.\nComments www.chicagotribune.com/zorn\nTwitter @ EricZorn\n Uber Opinion Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/ericzorn", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560eafac/turbine/ct-uber-chicago-airport-edit-1005-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ec796/turbine/ct-uber-taxi-city-hall-met-1003-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616d939/turbine/ct-taxi-drivers-uber-lyft-perspec-zorn-1009-jm-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:51:47.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
