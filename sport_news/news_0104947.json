Jared Sullinger sees some of the same traits in video coordinator Brandon Bailey Comments \nWALTHAM -- Over recent years, the Boston Celtics have shuffled through a list of highly-regarded defensive coaches including Tom Thibodeau and Darren Erman. \nThe latter assistant left this summer to join the New Orleans Pelicans staff, but Jared Sullinger doesn't see a big change in the Celtics system. \n\"It's not really different,\" Sullinger added. \"It's the same thing. From (Mike Longabardi) to (Tom Thibodeau)...all those guys that have been here, it's almost like it's been passed down.\" \nAfter Erman joined the Pelicans as an associate head coach, the Celtics hired Jerome Allen as an assistant. But according to Sullinger, it's been head video coordinator and coaching assistant Brandon Bailey taking on some of Erman's responsibilities. \n\"Now we've got Brandon Bailey helping us out,\" Sullinger said. \"He's similar to Erman. Things are running smoothly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:20:22.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
