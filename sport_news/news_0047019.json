In the absence of purchase by government agencies, the farmers were forced to sell their crop to private dealers for a price ranging between Rs 1200 and Rs 1300 instead of the MRP of Rs 1,450 “I brought my crop to the grain market today trusting government’s announcement that state agencies will procure paddy today. But when no agency came forward, I had to sell my PB-1509 paddy for Rs 1206 per quintal,” claimed Rajesh Kumar, a farmer from Alika village of Sirsa. Surja Ram, another farmer, said he too had to sell his PB-1509 variety for Rs 1,235 as there was no government purchase in the grain market. Surinder Minchnabadi, president of the Sirsa Grain Market Traders Association, said HAFED was supposed to purchase paddy today, but he was informed that they could not so far execute their agreement with the rice millers. The state government had claimed to have begun procurement of paddy on September 24 this year instead of October 1 as usual and had also announced the procurement of PB-1509 variety of paddy for at the MSP of Rs 1450 per quintal announced for PR varieties. However, no paddy was purchased by government agencies even today .Tomorrow being a holiday on account of Gandhi Jayanti, farmers can now hope for the start of government purchase on October 3. Diwan Chand Sharma, District Food and Supplies Controller, Sirsa, however, claimed that he had been sending government agencies to the grain market regularly since September 24. “If a farmer does not get Rs 1,450 per quintal or more in the open market, the agencies are duty-bound to purchase the crop at the MSP,” he added. Cotton procurement begins in Sirsa Sirsa: After suffering heavy losses, courtesy the whitefly attack, farmer coming to the mandi with their cotton crop are protesting the low prices for their produce. Cotton crop sold for nearly Rs 4,400 per quintal today in Sirsa, the biggest producer of cotton in the state. \"Though the price is almost equivalent to last year's price, we were expecting better prices given less production of crop this year owing to whitefly attack,\" said Gurdial Mehta, a trader and a farmer from Panjuana village. He said against the productivity of 8 to 9 quintal per acre last year, farmers were getting less than 6 quintal crop per acre this year. \"Unless we receive at least Rs 5,000 per quintal, we may not be able to recover the money spent on inputs,\" he said. Cotton prices witnessed a surge in 2010 when it sold for Rs 7,000 per quintal; many farmers believe the cotton prices could rise at a later stage this season due to shortage of supply. Gurpreet Singh Nagpal, general secretary, district unit, Haryana State Cotton Ginners Association, said the arrival of cotton was very low so far. — TNS Ensure prompt lifting, says Kiran Bhiwani: Kiran Choudhry, Leader of the Haryana Congress Legislature Party (CLP), has blamed the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP Government for the problems faced by farmers in getting their paddy procured in the mandis. Their problems are mounting by the day with fresh arrivals adding to the pile but the stocks are not being lifted. The former Excise and Taxation Minister said now that the strike by the millers had been called off, the government should swing into action and ensure that paddy brought to mandis is procured. Even though the procurement of kharif crops started a week earlier, farmers have been forced to protest the non-lifting of their stocks, she added. She demanded that the central sales tax (CST) should not be imposed on the sale of rice to other states and the BJP Government should also revoke 4 per cent tax on procurement of paddy through Form C. — TNS 'No policy framed for farmers' Kaithal: BKU president Gurnam Singh Chadhuni said here today that the centre as well as the state government had failed to formulate any policy to safeguard the interests of farmers causing strong resentment among the farming community . The farmers continued to suffer huge financial losses due to a low price of paddy. Every year there was a fluctuation in the prices of various crops brought to mandis. This year too, the PB-1509 paddy variety was fetching Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,350 per quintal as against the price of Rs 2500- 3500 last year . The government had announced to purchase PB-1509 at the MSP of Rs 1,450 per quintal but this price too was unremunerative . He said the government should formulate a policy to ensure that farmers got remunerative prices for their crops . He demanded adequate compensation for crop loss and a good price for paddy. — OC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:20:11.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
