By COLLIN AMOS Come one, come all to Tybee Island this Columbus Day weekend and join in the revelry of the 11th annual Tybee Island Pirate Fest!\nThe annual event, hosted by South End Association of Bars and Restaurants, attracts thousands of swashbuckling pirate enthusiasts to the island for four days of family-friendly merriment and cheer.\n“Tybee Island Pirate Fest encapsulates all that is quirky about Tybee,” said Christy Alan, 2015 festival committee member. “Fun seekers live out their pirate fantasies, even entire families ... moms, dads and kids dress the part for the weekend. It’s just a blast.”\nTybee Island Pirate Fest began in 2005 as an event to boost visitation to Tybee in the off-season months. Since its inception, the event has grown to be wildly popular, attracting visitors from across the nation to take part in the unique festival.\n“Now in our 11th year, Tybee Island Pirate Fest has grown into one of the biggest weekends of the year for Tybee Island,” said Jenny Orr, Tybee SEABAR president. “The economic impact of this one event helps many of us carry our businesses and employees through the off-season. Almost all the festivalgoers stay on Tybee Island for the weekend, boosting revenues for our retail shops, restaurants, bars, hotels and vacation rentals. Plus, it is the most fun party of the year!”\nPirate Fest kicks off Oct. 8 with the Buccaneer Ball at The Crab Shack. It will be a night full of fun, food, drink and live entertainment. This event is for pirates ages 18 and older only, so no little mateys are allowed inside. Pirate Fest’s 2015 King and Queen, Lannie and Stacye Jarrell, will also be crowned, so be sure to come and pay yer respects. Tickets can be purchased at the door or online for $50 until capacity is reached. A valid photo ID is required for admittance to the event. A few other things to keep in mind when coming to the Buccaneer Ball:\n• Do bring pirate garb, pirate attitude and pirate lingo.\n• Don’t bring children or anyone younger than 18, outside food/drink or real weapons.\n• Parking is available at The Crab Shack, but no shuttle will be running. Cab company information can be found at www.visittybee.com/travel-aid/transportation .\n• Printed tickets are not necessary for entry into the Buccaneer Ball, but the name on your ticket must match your photo ID.\nOct. 9 is when festivities for the entire family begin in the festival zone, which is from Butler Avenue at 14th Street to 17th Street and Tybrisa Street to 17th Street from The Strand to the beach. More information on the festival zone (which is new for this year’s festivities) can be found in the Buccaneer Bulletin or at www.tybeepiratefest.com . The entire weekend is packed with live entertainment, a huge, jolly parade down Butler Avenue, food, drinks, kid’s activities and much more.\nThis year’s musical headliners on the main stage are Big Engine and Junior Marvin’s Wailers. Big Engine, a popular rock group that has performed with Charlie Daniels, Buckcherry, Motorhead and several other famous acts, is headlining the show Oct. 9. Junior Marvin and the Wailers, a blues/rock band whose lead singer, Junior Marvin, has performed with Stevie Wonder, Bob Marley, OAR and other popular groups, will take the stage Oct. 10. Additional acts include Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love and MiniKiss.\nSapphire Bullets of Pure Love, a native Savannah band, will be the closing act Oct. 9, taking the stage at 9:15 p.m. This 13-piece band includes the five-member Bonaventure Horns and covers the likes of Frank Sinatra, Prince, Otis Redding and The Rolling Stones. MiniKiss, a cover band that performs songs from Kiss and other ‘80s bands, will take the stage Oct. 10. This unique act, composed entirely of little people, appeared in “Mall Cop 2,” the Dr. Pepper/Kiss Super Bowl commercial, “The George Lopez Show” and “Gene Simmons Family Jewels.”\nThe main stage isn’t the only place where pirate revelry is to be had. The Thieves Market is the place to barter for pirate treasures of all varieties, while the petting zoo is perfect for wee little buccaneers looking to pet exotic animals. There is also a 90-foot Ferris wheel, the Sea Ray, a swinging pirate ship ride, a carousel, weapons demonstrations and more to keep the swashbuckling cheer alive.\nFor pirates looking to carry around their tankards of ale outside the festival zone, a new wristband policy is in place. For more information, go to the Tybee Island Pirate Fest website.\nSince drinks will be available by the plenty, free shuttles have been arranged for the weekend. They will run from 5 p.m.-midnight Oct. 9 and 1 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Oct. 10. The route may vary from 3-5 p.m. Oct. 10 due to the parade. The shuttle will stop at the following locations: Hotel Tybee, Tybee Market IGA, Beachside Colony, Tybee Island City Hall, the Sugar Shack, Tybee Island Light Station, Savannah Beach & Racquet Club, Dragon Fly (across from Seaside Sisters).\nDon’t miss out on this classic Tybee Island event. Leave your worries behind and enter the pirate village for a weekend of fun and frivolity with family and friends. As they say, escape the ordinary ... if only for the weekend!\nFor all things Tybee, go to www.visittybee.com , find us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter @visittybee.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Tybee Island Pirate Fest\nWhen: Oct. 8-11\nWhere: Various locations on Tybee Island\nCost: $50 for Buccaneer Ball; $12 on Oct. 9; $15 on Oct. 10; free on Oct. 11 and all weekend for children 12 and younger; $25 for a weekend pass\nInfo: www.tybeepiratefest.com\nSCHEDULE\nOct. 8\n6-10 p.m. Buccaneer Ball at The Crab Shack\nOct. 9\nMain Stage\n5-6 p.m. Whatever Bar DJ\n6-7 p.m. Voodoo Soup\n7-7:15 p.m. Pirate Invasion Opening Ceremony\n7:15-8:15 p.m. Whatever Bar DJ\n8:15-9:15 p.m. Big Engine\n9:15-10:45 p.m. Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love\nLittle Matey’s Cove\n5-11 p.m. Carnival with Ferris wheel, Sea Ray, carousel and more\n5-7 p.m. Petting Zoo with exotic animals\n6-11 p.m. Pirate Encampment by Tybee Arts Association\nOct. 10\n3-5 p.m. Pirate Victory Parade\nMain Stage\n12:30-2 p.m. TBA\n2-3 p.m. Whatever Bar DJ\n5-6 p.m. Whatever Bar DJ\n6-7 p.m. Rouges, Wenches and Krewes Costume Contests\n7-7:45 p.m. Whatever Bar DJ\n7:45-8:45 p.m. MiniKiss\n9 p.m. Fireworks by Wet Willie’s\n9:15-10:15 p.m. Junior Marvin’s Wailers\n10:15-11 p.m. Whatever Bar DJ\nLittle Matey’s Cove\n10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Carnival with Ferris wheel, Sea Ray, carousel and more!\n10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Petting Zoo with exotic animals\n10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Pirate Encampment by Tybee Arts Association\n1-2 p.m. Children and Pets Costume Contest\nOct. 11\nMain Stage\n11 a.m. Tybee Bar Church\n2-3:30 p.m. Whatever Bar DJ\nLittle Matey’s Cove\nNoon-4 p.m. Carnival with Ferris wheel, Sea Ray, carousel and more!\nNoon-4 p.m. Petting Zoo with exotic animals\nNoon-4 p.m. Pirate Encampment by Tybee Arts Association\nBud Light Beach Sweep\nMeet at the main stage at noon to help clean the beach.
