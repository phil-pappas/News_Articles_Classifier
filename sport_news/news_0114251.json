They scored three touchdowns and a field goal over the next 3 1/2 minutes and put the game away with a 28-point third quarter. \nInterceptions by William Jackson III and Donald Gage set up another touchdown and a field goal in the final 50 seconds of the half. Houston quarterback Greg Ward Jr. scored on a three-yard run to make it 21-10, and after Gage's interception, a 34-yard field goal by Ty Cummings gave Houston a 24-10 lead on the final play of the half. \nTristan Payton scored UCF's touchdown on a 46-yard pass from Justin Holman, but the Golden Knights (0-8, 0-4) had four turnovers and gained only 105 yards after the first quarter. \nFarrow, who moved into seventh place on Houston's career rushing list with 2,686 yards, left the game after running 24 yards to his third touchdown of the game with 1:57 left in the third quarter. \nWard also sat out the fourth quarter after completing 16 of 23 passes for 210 yards and a touchdown and also rushing for 46 yards and a touchdown, his 15th rushing TD of the season. Ward's 67-yard touchdown pass to Demarcus Ayers put Houston up 45-10 with 4:10 left in the third quarter. \nIt was only Houston's second win in seven games against UCF. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nKenneth Farrow ran for 167 yards and three touchdowns and No. 21 Houston remained undefeated with a 59-10 victory over winless Central Florida on Saturday. \nThe Cougars (7-0, 4-0 AAC) scored 24 points in a mid-game span of 3 1/2 minutes and won for the fifth time by 21 points or more. \nHouston cornerback Brandon Wilson scored on an 85-yard return of a fumble on the third play of the game, but the Cougars fell behind 10-7 before rallying late in the first half and turning the game into a rout in the third quarter. \nFarrow's 26-yard touchdown run gave Houston the lead with 2:26 left in the half, and interceptions by William Jackson III and Donald Gage set up a TD and a field goal in the final 50 seconds. \nTristan Payton scored UCF's touchdown on a 46-yard pass from Justin Holman, but the Golden Knights (0-8, 0-4) had four turnovers and gained only 105 yards after the first quarter \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
