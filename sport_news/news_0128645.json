Southern beat us in just about every single stat. They were the team that deserved to win.” \nThe Pirates looked dangerous during a handful of counterattacks on Tuesday, but will need a more complete performance to advance in the upcoming District 11 tournament. \n“I think we kind of played as individuals tonight and not as a team, and that’s something we’re going to need to work on for districts,” Willman said. \nEither way, Palisades’ goalkeeper is already in championship form.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:00:58.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
