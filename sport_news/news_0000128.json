Although senior officials said the government had appointed a selection committee for taking the decision, the RTI activists supporting technocrats questioned Negi’s appointment. They said it involved a conflict of interest since he was holding the charge of the Power Department and was the chairperson of HP State Electricity Board Limited (HPSEBL). Negi will join office tomorrow. He has replaced Subhash C Negi, who retired from the post on September 22 this year. “All decisions related to board and power were influenced by him. The entire process of selection was monitored by him,” charged Dr Brig (retd) Daleep S Chhajta, who has sought information from the Chief Secretary on the selection procedure under the Right To Information Act. Chhajta said he had not got any information so far. He said the Chief Secretary told him that the Additional Chief Secretary, Power, was the right person to talk to. Chhajta said the Chief Secretary categorically replied to his queries saying his office did not have the records and re-directed his application to the office of the Additional Chief Secretary, Power. But he did not receive any reply to his query, he said. Chhajta said it was an irony that the state government had appointed SKBS Negi as the SERC chairperson, replacing Subhash C Negi who had retired on September 22. “I am disappointed as the Public Information Officer of the Additional Chief Secretary has not replied to my queries,” Chhajta said, adding that once Negi joined office, it would be impossible to revoke the decision. The government had appointed a selection committee comprising the Chief Secretary, a retired HC Judge and a retired IAS officer from the Central Electricity Authority(CEA). “It has no no independent member having technical knowledge which should have been mandatory for the selection of the technical post,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:17:30.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
