(Photo: Jack Hardman/The News-Press) Buy Photo \nEvangelical Christian junior golfer Shane Reynolds has seen the Whispering Oak course at Verandah more than any other competitor in District A-17 this season, and on Monday he put that knowledge to good use. \nReynolds’ even-par round of 72 earned him his second consecutive medalist honor, while Bishop Verot claimed the team title with a score of 307. \n“Repeating as medalist is pretty cool and to do it on my home course where I’ve played my whole life is cool. The pins were pretty tough today, and you had to place it well off the tee to get to them.” Reynolds said. \nTotaling six birdies on the 6,416 yard layout, three going out on the front nine and three coming in on the back nine, Reynolds began his round with a double bogey, but recovered with three straight birdies on holes 4-6. Going out in 37, Reynolds had birdies on 11, 14, and 17 en route to coming home with a one under par 35 on the back. \nThe Vikings were paced by Blake Wheeler’s 75, to go along with 77’s from Cole Connor and Mason Kiernan, and a 78 from Harrison Kyle.

Canterbury took the final spot with a team score of 351, led by Chad Bowling’s 82. \nThe three highest individual scores not among the teams advancing also advanced to regional play, and all came from the host school Southwest Florida Christian. Max Pringle came in with an 88, Luke Wallace signed for a 91, and Nicholas Newingham registered a 98. \nThe regional will be next Monday at Bradenton Country Club. \nDistrict A-17 Championship \nat Whispering Oak at Verandah, par 72 \nBishop Verot : Blake Wheeler 75, Cole Connor 77, Mason Kiernan 77, Harrison Kyle 78, Alex Hussey 82 \nEvangelical Christian : Shane Reynolds 72, Nick Partipilo 77, Kory Keel 87, Jarred Jordan 88, Jaxon Wolff 91 \nCanterbury : Chad Bowling 82, Jason Gottko 83, Cameron Fencher 92, JJ Gamba 94, Trennan Turco 98 \nSouthwest Florida Christian Academy : Max Pringle 88, Luke Wallace 91, Nicholas Newingham 98, Baxton Munn 103, Mikey Bubar 105 \nOasis : Chase Ryan 99, Colton Poling 107, John Hickel 107, Eric Hebert 116, Jimmy Jackson 118 \nMoore Haven: Donovan Osceola 100, Patrick Metzler 126, Brice Prowant 126, Austin Lee 152, Colin Ahern 165 1 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://newspr.es/1RFANo2 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:37:06.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
