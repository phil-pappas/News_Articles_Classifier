That’s a relief! I was afraid Harden was planning to round up an O.J. Simpson -style posse, bust into Curry’s Orinda home and take the trophy. \n•If I were Colin Kaepernick , I would be phoning my mother in Modesto. “Mom, would you rummage around the attic and see if you can find my old baseball glove?” \n•Why denigrate Jim Tomsula because he doesn’t look like an NFL coach? Vince Lombardi looked like the guy hoisting cans onto a trash truck. Bill Walsh looked like the mixed-doubles tennis champ at Bushwood CC. Pete Carroll looks like the aging ski instructor who is really helping your wife with her bindings. Mike Singletary , now he looked like a coach . \n•If the Giants come up with a strong bench next season, good for them. But why start talking now about reducing Madison Bumgarner ’s role with a bat? Over the past two seasons, MadBomb hit .252, with nine homers and 24 RBIs in 143 at-bats. \n• Billy Beane has been promoted from general manager to executive vice president of baseball operations. Beane is a part owner of the A’s. Dear Mr. Beane: Thanks for the promotion! I will work hard to justify your faith in me. (Signed) Billy.” \n• Ichiro Suzuki will play another season at 42, eyeing 65 more hits to reach 3,000. He batted .229 this year. Posted a .561 OPS, 200 points under his career average. Somewhere, Pete Rose is limbering up. \n•Can’t wait for the Sepp Blatter biopic: “The Line on Ethics: Bend It Like Blatter.” \n• Zack Greinke would look good in a Giants’ uni, but the bidding might get too hot. More realistic: Jordan Zimmermann . Two years younger than Greinke, with almost exactly half of Greinke’s odometer reading, innings-wise. \n•With the Nationals, the Mariners and others looking for a new manager, is Ron Washington back in the game? And is this when Ron Wotus finally gets a shot? \n•Self-serving claptrap dept.: UCLA football coach Jim Mora strongly advises his two-way star Myles Jack , recovering from an injury, not to turn pro. Mora calls the move “very risky.” Certainly no risk in playing another season of college ball, where nobody gets hurt. \n• Matt Barnes beats up Derek Fisher because Fisher is dating Barnes’ estranged wife, Gloria Govan . Can’t blame Fisher. Since Barnes is dating other women, Fisher assumed Govan had cleared waivers.
