The Fighting Clan quarterback situation is up in the air after Pacheco injured his right shoulder during their loss to Atlantic City on Oct. 10. Pacheco practiced this week, but will still be a game-time decision. If he can’t go, it’ll be Williams’ show. Williams doesn’t have Pacheco’s speed but he proved he can sling it when he hit Jarred Banks on a beautiful touchdown pass against the Vikings. Whoever goes will have to be wary of Lyon, who can disrupt Vineland’s offense with a strong pass rush. Vineland RB Daivon Seymore (6-0, 220) vs. Absegami LB John Searight (6-2, 205). Because of the Fighting Clan’s question marks at quarterback, Seymore will be counted on to have a huge game for Vineland. Seymore has been the Fighting Clan’s best offensive player this season, rushing for 585 yards and six scores while also catching a touchdown pass. He’ll need to step it up a notch in this game, and to do that he’ll have to avoid Searight, who’s a leader in the Braves’ linebacker corps. Vineland CB Isaiah Jones (5-9, 173) vs. Absegami RB Vinnie Nelson (5-9, 175). Nelson is the Braves’ most talented weapon on the offensive end, as they use him both in the backfield and as a wide receiver. Nelson has game-breaking speed and if he gets to the outside, it could mean big trouble for Vineland. Jones also has explosive speed, and he’ll be tasked with keeping Nelson contained, both when he runs to toward the sideline and when he’s flanked out wide. Vineland's Gonzalez moved back to city for football \nKeys to the Game Vineland needs to stay ahead of the chains. The Fighting Clan have struggled scoring this season without the help of a big play or a short field. Of Vineland’s nine touchdown drives, six have found the end zone in two plays or fewer, and another lasted just five plays. While it’s great to get big plays, it’s very difficult to count on them game in and game out. For the Fighting Clan to become more consistent on offense, they need to prove they can sustain long drives. To do that, they’ll need to get into third-and-manageable situations. Vineland has to do a better job securing the ball. The Fighting Clan have fumbled the ball 14 times this season. While they’ve only lost six, the negative yardage has severely hampered their offense. Vineland can’t keep giving away free yardage and expect to win games. Vineland must find a way to keep Absegami’s aerial attack in check. The Fighting Clan have allowed at least 10 completions in three of their last four games, and have given up seven passing touchdowns in five games, including three in their loss to Atlantic City on Oct. 10. Absegami has already completed six TDs through the air this year. If Vineland can’t keep the Braves grounded, a fourth consecutive loss is a real possibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:40:39.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
