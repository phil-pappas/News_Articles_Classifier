Caron is only a sophomore at Governor’s Academy in Byfield, Mass., but the Hampton resident is on the right path to reach her goals as a standout field hockey player. Caron was named the Independent School League Player of the Year and National Field Hockey Coaches Association Regional All-American as a freshman. This summer Caron was named to the 2015-16 USA Field Hockey U-17 Women’s National Team. She earned that appointment on her performance at the Junior National Camp in Lancaster, Penn. Thirty-eight players, including five goalies were invited to the Junior National Camp and 26 were selected. “It was my first time ever getting to JNC so I wasn’t really expecting much,” Caron said. “I just wanted to play the best I could and focus on my game and stand my ground against the older players.” That Caron, age 15, has the ability to play Division I field hockey is unquestioned, says her coach at Governor’s, Tracy Stickney. “It all starts with her stick skills,” said Stickney, who played collegiately at Wake Forest. “She has put so much time in on controlling the ball and having great stick skills. Field hockey has become a real three-dimensional game and she is at the forefront of that. The ball is off the ground more than it is on it now at the top levels. Sky literally carries the ball still on her stick and it’s almost like she’s cradling the puck. She can throw the ball – lift the ball -- almost 50 yards now.” Stickney said Caron also has the physical tools of size (5-foot-8), strength and speed along with plenty of game smarts. “She’s that player who has the skill but doesn’t force it,” Stickney said. “She uses it at the right time.” Advancing to the Olympics is considerably tougher, particularly in a sport where the current U.S. Women’s National Team includes multiple players who have been on the team since 2005. “Ever since I was little I always wanted to be an Olympian,” Sky Caron said. “My mom was involved in the US lacrosse team, so she really inspired me. She was the goalkeeper and she was on the national lacrosse team. She got to travel to Europe.” Cathy (Narsiff) Caron, was a two-sport goalie at the University of New Hampshire from 1984-87, played on the 1985 national champion women’s lacrosse team, and still holds the career save percentage record for both ice hockey (.935) and lacrosse. At Governor’s, Sky Caron is joined by a strong contingent of Hampton-area players, including her twin sister Finn. Like her sister, Finn Caron, was a first-team ISL player as a freshman. “Sky has gotten more attention in the past year but two years ago they both made Junior Olympics (and competed in Des Moines),” Stickney said. “Sky is a midfielder and Finny is a forward and likes to put the ball in the goal. With both of them on my team I love having that combination.” Also on Governor’s field hockey team are Hampton resident Mitzy Wiggin and Jensen Palmer. Wiggin, a senior co-captain, was an all-ISL defender as a junior. Palmer, a junior, is a two-year starter in the midfield. The Caron sisters went to North Hampton School from grades K-8, where their father Mike is the enrichment coordinator and Cathy also works. Sky Caron said the family recently moved to Hampton. As a member of the U-17 National team, Sky Caron will participate in three weekend camps over the winter at USA Field Hockey’s primary training center in Lancaster. The U-17 team will also host a similar team from Belgium. She’ll also continue to work to improve at Governor’s and while playing for her club team, Northeast Elite. “I’d like to work on stepping up as a leader, especially in high school, by really communicating on the field and helping other players,” Caron said. “And nationally, I want to improve by just not backing down. Even though some of the girls may be older, stronger or even better I just have to try my best and work really hard.” Stickney said she expects Sky Caron to continue to move forward in field hockey – and wouldn’t be surprised to see her twin sister join her on the increasingly challenging path in the near future. “Sky and Finny, they both have all the physical and mental attributes to be successful at the national level,” Stickney said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:50:29.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
