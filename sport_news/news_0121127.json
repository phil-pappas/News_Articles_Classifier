Aller, Getty Images Justin K. Aller, Getty Images Mark another grudge for Baltimore Ravens wide recevier Steve Smith Sr. on his NFL farewell tour.\nAdChoices Smith was knocked out of the Ravens' 23-20 overtime loss Thursday to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a hit from safety Mike Mitchell in the third quarter. The 36-year-old said the safety said \"how you like that?\" after delivering the blow.\n\"The best thing I could do without threatening him and saying that I will assault him when I see him is I will say, I look forward to playing him again and he's on my lifetime hit list,\" Smith said after the game.\nSmith left the game with a lower-back injury and did not return to the game. He finished with four catches for 24 yards.\nMitchell played with Smith on the 2013 Carolina Panthers. Smith also remarked, \"I kind of know his character, who he is.\"\nSmith has never been afraid to call out his opponents, and has gone on to notable rematches against the Panthers as well as cornerback Aqib Tali. But in his final NFL season, Smith now has his AFC North rival in his sights.\nThe Ravens play the Steelers again in Week 16 on Dec. 27.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:25:12.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
