So with Mourinho, it is the same. He knows he can count on me always. He respects that, I respect not only him but all coaches which I've had in my life.\n\"We won the Premier League and League Cup together [last season]. We did great things together. I am sure we will continue, maybe this year we will win something also.\"\nBelgium star Eden Hazard is another to have been dropped by Mourinho due to poor form this season but Matic is adamant he remains one of the world's best.\n\"Eden is a great guy, a great player, the best player in the league last year, very important for us,\" the former Benfica man continued.\n\"For the rest, you'd have to ask the coach. I am very happy when I play with him. It's very simple, you pass him the ball and he always does something. Eden is one of the best players in the world.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:24:36.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
