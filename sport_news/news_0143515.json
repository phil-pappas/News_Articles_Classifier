I have always said that I don’t set myself any dates because it isn’t up to me. As much as I would like to play tomorrow, the doctors wouldn’t let me. \n“When they tell me that I have recovered completely will be the time that I will make my return onto the pitch.” \nThe inspired of form of Neymar has allowed Barcelona to negotiate most of the obstacles presented since Messi went out as, despite a 2-1 defeat to Sevilla, they remain joint top of La Liga and well on course to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League. \nHowever, Argentina missed their star man badly as they took just one point from their opening two games of World Cup qualifying, losing 2-0 at home to Ecuador before a 0-0 draw at to Paraguay earlier this month. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:05:16.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
