They are hoping another week of practice and reps will help quarterback Michael Vick, who is taking the place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger. Vick should give the ball to running back Le'Veon Bell more often and give wide receiver Antonio Bryant more opportunities to produce big plays. Wide receiver Martavis Bryant is back after serving a four-game suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy.\nThe Chargers find themselves in the same situation as the Steelers. The Chargers need to win to stay close to first-place Denver in the AFC West. The Chargers needed an incredible performance from quarterback Philip Rivers (23 of 38 passes for 358 yards, three TDs and no interceptions) in their 30-27 home win against Cleveland in Week 4. The Chargers will look to rookie running back Melvin Gordon to help revive a running game that has disappeared in the past two games. The return of star tight end Antonio Gates will aid the offense. Gates was suspended four games after testing positive for performance enhancing drugs.\nIf you want to watch the Steelers compete against the Chargers, here's what you need to know.\nWhat : Pittsburgh Steelers at San Diego Chargers\nWhere : Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, California\nWhen : Monday, Oct. 12, 5:25 p.m./8:25 p.m. ET\nTV : ESPN\nWatch online : You can watch a live stream on ESPN's WatchESPN app or DirecTV's live stream package.\n-- Geoffrey C.
