(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \n146 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN 46 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Allen Park â€” Lions coach Jim Caldwell spoke with owner and chairwoman Martha Firestone Ford at some point after the team's embarrassing 42-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.\nCaldwell wouldn't say whether the conversation happened Sunday, as it typically does, or Monday morning, but whenever it happened, the tone of the message from the Ford family was clear.\n\"They're not happy, obviously, which you could anticipate and understand very well,\" Caldwell said during his Monday news conference. \"And they were certainly as upset about this game as anybody, like they have been about the entire season. It's our job to get that turned around.\"\nThe directive from general manager Martin Mayhew and president Tom Lewand is similar, according to Caldwell.\n\"It's been the same, consistent, not satisfied,\" he said. \"We've got to do better.\"\nDETROIT NEWS\nWojo: Lions fix should start with coordinator Lombardi\nHow the Lions turn things around after starting 0-5 is anybody's guess. Caldwell reiterated Monday that the team won't make any coaching changes, as he said immediately after the game.\nThe Lions rank 26th in total offense and 30th in scoring. Defensively, the Lions rank 22nd overall and 26th in points allowed. They're the only NFL team without a win.\nCaldwell said he planned to consult with his assistant coaches later Monday to discuss the adjustments and changes the team needs to make. And despite the problematic start, Caldwell said the goal for his staff is unchanged.\n\"We still come to work, look at our problems, try to solve our problems and focus in on our guys and the things that we can control, and that's been our focus,\" he said.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein \nDetroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford watches on the sidelines in the fourth quarter with offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and head coach Jim Caldwell, after he was benched in the second half of the game against the Arizona Cardinals at Ford Field in Detroit Sunday Oct. 11, 2015.
