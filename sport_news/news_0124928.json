Hanna (123), Harlingen South (146), PSJA Southwest (148) and PSJA High School (156) rounded out the top five. \nIn the boys race, Rivera finished first as a team with 72 points, followed by PSJA Southwest (88), La Joya Juarez-Lincoln (103), Harlingen High (162) and Brownsville Veterans Memorial (164). \nMercedes’ Jonathan Reyes, another 2014 state qualifier, finished first in the boys race with a personal best time of 15:14, besting Hidalgo’s Moises Campos (15:50.79 and Rivera’s Jonathan Herrera (15:55.84). \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:26:27.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
