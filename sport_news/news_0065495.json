(Photo: MICHAEL ROLANDS/RECORD-HERALD) Buy Photo\nCONNECT TWEET Adam Heater capped his senior campaign, and concluded a stellar season by the Indianola boys golf team, at the state meet in Cedar Rapids over the weekend.\nHeater shot 82-77 — 159 in the two-day state meet at Elmcrest Country Club to finish with a share of 18th-place in the 80-golfer field.\n“He did not play very well the first day and played considerably better the second day,” Indianola boys golf coach Gene Capps said about Heater’s performance on Friday and Saturday. “That was the first time he’d ever been there and I thought that he held up reasonably well.”\nBen Epperly of West Des Moines Valley claimed the individual state title with a score of 74-68 — 142. Waukee captured the team title with a four-player score of 303-313 — 616.\nIndianola narrowly missed qualifying for the state meet as a team after shooting 305 to place fourth in district play at Indianola Country Club on Oct. 6. The Indians placed one-stroke behind district third-place finisher Des Moines Roosevelt’s tally of 304 strokes.\nThe top three teams in each district qualify for the state meet. In any of the other three Class 4-A districts, Indianola’s team score would have beaten or matched the district second-place finisher.\nHeater captured his individual spot in the state meet with a district runner-up round of 71 strokes. Jake Marvelli and Ben Krapfl each carded scores of 77 and Scout Dishman completed the team scoring with 84 strokes.\nDowling Catholic won the district team title with a score of 299. Johnston placed second with 301 strokes.\nIn non-scoring play at Indianola Country Club, Indianola’s Tyler Piper hit an 82 and Jackson Bishop shot 84.\n“We were a pretty good team this year. We were actually very successful. We won four tournaments, we had a decent dual meet record,” Capps said.\nThe Indians finished the season with a 6-2 mark in dual meet competitions.\nCONNECT TWEET //dmreg.co/1Lr0XtX", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//dmreg.co/1Lr0XtX&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797485471796963-sp.Golf-IHS-09.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a6b1a8a2906cd32eda84e8d32d3c249a602b7c2/c=91-0-1909-1367&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797485471796963-sp.Golf-IHS-09.jpg", "http://dmreg.co/1Lr0XtX", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//dmreg.co/1Lr0XtX&text=Heater%20competes%20at%20state%2C%20IHS%20boys%20golf%204th%20in%20district&via=DMRegister", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18b6850ecd1e7c167848c1a095f3c62acd352cdf/r=500x341/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797485471796963-sp.Golf-IHS-09.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:14:26.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
