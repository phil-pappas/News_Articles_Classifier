Princess Anne opened the season with a victory over First Colonial, but suffered three straight losses. The Cavaliers have won the last two games to jump to 3-3 - equaling their most victories in a season since 2004, when they finished 3-7.\nPrincess Anne hasn't finished above .500 since 2000. The Cavaliers were 5-5 in 2003.\nPrincess Anne limped into postseason last year despite a 2-8 record and was shut out by Salem. But after back-to-back wins, the Cavaliers this week sit fifth in the 5A South Region power ratings.\nThe latest win, a 60-21 decision over Tallwood last Friday, came with a break-out game for Walton. He rushed for 130 yards and five touchdowns and intercepted two passes.\nThe win, the way the entire team played and the resulting success by Walton have the Cavaliers abuzz heading into tonight's game against Green Run.\n\"I knew there were good guys here... talent,\" Fair said. \"They've suffered through tough times and one of the hardest things is trying to turn all of that around.\n\"They know they can win and now they just need to learn how to win. They've really turned the corner.\"\nWalton had a sense during the summer that things would go this way.\n\"He brought me memories of intensity and started helping us believe what he was saying,\" Walton said. \"He took us under his wing and showed us.\"\nFair didn't know at first how his new team would react to so much change. But he felt better about it when Walton and a couple of other players started showing up early and staying late for summer workouts.\n\"I knew he had the talent physically,\" Fair said. \"But he was a surprise. This summer, he and a couple of others would be out here at 8 in the morning working out.\n\"He's really picked it up, man. He's starting to get it now.\"\nWalton, a 5-foot-9, 160-pounder, is also getting that he needs to do more if he expects to play in college. He's planning to take Advanced Placement classes next year to improve his academic standing.\n\"I'd really like to go to West Virginia,\" Walton said. \"Wake Forest or Tennessee would work.\"\nFair thinks a team that takes a chance on Walton will be rewarded.\n\"He's got things you can't teach,\" Fair said. \"He's extremely talented... maybe more than any I've coached at his age in my nine years. He's naturally gifted on defense and he does things on offense that makes guys miss him. And while he's not that tall, he can power through and run by people.\n\"I think once (coaches) see his athleticism, somebody will make him an offer.\"\nMeanwhile, there are four more games in the regular season and the chance that the Cavaliers could make the Group 5A South Region playoffs.\n\"Everybody expected a change when we got started,\" Walton said. \"This is exciting and we're not done yet.\"\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
