I can’t give any more details, the issue is being discussed in two investigations.”\nAsked directly if the contract had been made within the rules, Blatter added: “Yes, certainly, it was within the rules.”\nBlatter and Platini, 60, have both been suspended for 90 days by FIFA’s ethics committee as Swiss authorities conduct a criminal investigation into corruption allegations at the scandal-tainted world football governing body.\nBlatter defiantly backed his right to discuss the ongoing controversy and investigation.\n“I don’t have the right to go to a football stadium, but I do have the right to talk to whoever I want,” he added.\n“I am not sidelined, I am only suspended.”\nRecommended: 4 reasons why FIFA’s Sepp Blatter must step down immediately\nBlatter, who has been in charge of FIFA since 1998, still intends to be present when the FIFA congress meets on February 26 to elect a new president.\n“My goal is to preside over the congress, that is my objective. I don’t believe it will be postponed.”\nBlatter also blasted the international media for “pre-judging” him, saying his suspension had been a “shock.”\nHe added he was baffled by the decision to bar him from his office.\n“I have not stolen, I haven’t killed, I haven’t favored anybody!”\nThe suspension, he said, had given him “time to think” and that he was “doing fine, even if it is a difficult period.”\nSee also: Switzerland approves extradition to US of Costa Rican FIFA official Eduardo Li", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:11:06.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
