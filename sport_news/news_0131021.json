As part of the partnership, Triax will harness cognitive computing APIs from the Watson developer platform to help prevent head injuries by leveraging Personality Insights API to better understand an athlete's behavior. This announcement comes as both Triax and IBM participate in #SportsFest™ in Brooklyn , a three-day conference and exhibition celebrating the leading innovators in sports, technology and media.\nTriax will utilize one of IBM's Watson API's -- Personality Insights -- in order to analyze sentiment and infer social characteristics to better respond to user inquiries and help make more intelligent recommendations regarding head impact incidence, response, treatments and return to play decisions. This is particularly meaningful given the constant evolution of concussion research and best practices.\nThe accuracy, comfort and ease of use of the Triax SIM™ have made it the preferred tool of leading athletes, organizations and research institutions. In October 2014 , Triax teamed up with U.S. soccer star, Abby Wambach , to encourage head impact monitoring for increased safety and training technique. As part of their efforts to shift player safety from a hot topic to a call to action, Abby encourages #BestPractices for all athletes, including listening to your body, training with safety in mind, and wearing a Triax SIM™ to monitor and track head impacts.\n\"Technology has become a mainstay in my own training, helping not only to perfect my game, but also to help support my safety,\" said Wambach. \"Now, insights and learnings from IBM Watson combined with use of the Triax SIM™ will bring better understanding of head impacts, a much-needed change in play that will benefit all.\"\nThe Triax Smart Impact Monitor (SIM™) tracks the force and frequency of head impacts during play and delivers that information to the sidelines in real-time. The small sensor is worn in a headband or skullcap. Whether a parent witnesses a hit during a game or hears about one at practice, the SIM's internal memory can store up to 180 separate events and automatically syncs impact data to the Triax applications. Users can create customizable profiles for their athletes that will establish a history of head impacts throughout his/her athletic career and help identify trends that may signify risky play or improper technique.\nCombining the cognitive abilities of Watson with the real-time, real-life monitoring of the Triax SIM™ marks a new frontier in concussion response. \"Partnering with IBM to tap into Watson not only validates our past achievements, but offers unmatched cognitive computing capabilities that we need to advance our platform to support more of today's athletes who are raising the bar everyday,\" said Chad Hollingsworth , Co-Founder and President, Triax Technologies. \"Quantifying hits to the head was an enormous step for understanding concussions, and now, with Triax powered by IBM Watson, it is just the beginning.\"\nTriax Technologies, Inc\nTriax Technologies, Inc is a U.S.-based product development company committed to setting new standards in the health and wellbeing of athletes. Working together with leading research institutions, we innovate, develop, manufacture and market new products that are designed specifically to meet emerging needs of athletes and those who are involved in ensuring their health and safety. Our goal is to put players first and support their development starting at the youth level by developing technology to address their needs.

Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. With the help of Watson , organizations are harnessing the power of cognitive computing to transform industries, help professionals do their jobs better, and solve important challenges.\nTo advance Watson , IBM has two dedicated business units: Watson , established for the development of cloud-delivered cognitive computing technologies that represent the commercialization of \"artificial intelligence\" or \"AI\" across a variety of industries, and Watson Health , dedicated to improving the ability of doctors, researchers and insurers and other related health organizations to surface new insights from data to and deliver personalized healthcare.\nFor more information on IBM Watson, visit: ibm.com/Watson and ibm.com/press/watson .\nJoin the conversation at #ibmwatson.
