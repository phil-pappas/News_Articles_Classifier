The honor is her first of 2015-16 after taking home three straight in the spring of her junior season. \nIn the first qualifier on Sept. 30 in Sioux City, Iowa, Fitts lapped the field with a 75, eight strokes better than the rest of the GPAC golfers. In pursuit of her four-straight GPAC title, Fitts extended her lead in the conference race to 11 strokes with a second win in less than a week Monday at Southern Hills Golf Course in Hastings, Neb. \nThe push by Fitts helped the Tigers climb from a fourth-place tie after the opening round into a tie for second, just 10 strokes off the pace.
