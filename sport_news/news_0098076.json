We have a result now and it's a point against the champions of last year,\" he added. \n\"If we'd won maybe we'd have been lucky, but unfortunately we couldn't hold on. \n\"We've had a good performance now but we know we can be better.\" — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:28:11.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
