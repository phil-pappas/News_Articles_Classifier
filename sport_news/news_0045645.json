Captain Lionel Messi and midfielders Ever Banega and Enzo Perez had already been withdrawn from Argentina’s squad due to injury. “Marcos Rojo will not be part of the squad for the qualifying debut against Ecuador and Paraguay, as he is in the final phase of recovery from a grade 1 injury in his right hamstring,” the Argentine Football Association said in a statement. Gerardo Martino’s team will host Ecuador in Buenos Aires on Thursday before an away clash against Paraguay in Asuncion five days later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:22:31.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
