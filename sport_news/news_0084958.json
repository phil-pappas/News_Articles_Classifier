The Pirates fully displayed that identity Tuesday night in moving into sole possession of first place in the Coastal 3-A Conference. Three different players scored and Swansboro allowed just three shots on frame in a 3-0 victory over White Oak in a match featuring the top two teams in the conference. Corey Rickards and Andrew Phillips each scored in the first half, and Joey Meyer added a second-half goal, while the Pirates recorded their 12th shutout en route to the key win. Swansboro (17-4, 8-1), ranked No. 10 in the latest N.C. Soccer Coaches Association 3-A poll, now controls its own destiny as it tries to claim the league crown with three remaining games. The Pirates already own a tiebreaker over the seventh-ranked Vikings (14-5, 7-2) given they also beat White Oak 1-0 on Sept. 24. “This was a massive win,” Swansboro coach Doug Kidd said. “Nothing but respect for White Oak because they are well-coached, and boy they took it to us at times in the first half and even in the beginning of the second half. But our defense held strong and we finished our chances.” The Pirates look to take another step closer to the conference crown Thursday when they play host to Jacksonville (8-5-4, 5-3), which defeated Swansboro 3-2 in overtime earlier this season. Meanwhile, White Oak still has to take care of business in trying to finish second ahead of Jacksonville, although the Vikings own a pair of victories over the Cardinals. “This win set us up. It’s definitely a step in the right direction,” Swansboro senior defender Gunner Tootle said. “(Wednesday) we need training to be real crisp and clean and then we have to be ready to play Thursday like we were today.” Swansboro has now won five consecutive games while White Oak saw its four-game winning streak end. The Vikings were without key defender Cam Jefferson because he was carded out and forced to sit. Also missing was starting goalkeeper Colby Humphrey, who was out because of disciplinary reasons. “We had to adjust to having guys have different roles,” WOHS coach Buddy Carroll said. “Some guys who don’t play as much played a little bit more. I think Swansboro did a good job of keeping the ball tonight. We had a few opportunities, but we didn’t get as many shots as I would have liked. After a while they started dropping eight or nine guys behind the ball.” Page 2 of 2 - Rickards, a sophomore, gave the Pirates a 1-0 lead with 25:27 left in the first half. Phillips started the scoring chance when he delivered a cross from the left side to Cadence Tootle, who then poked the ball forward toward Rickards. The ball slightly deflected off Rickards and a defender before Rickards managed to get a solid shot near the net for a goal. But while that goal was big, Phillips’ goal with 11.6 seconds left in the opening half to make it 2-0 gave Swansboro a boost heading into the break. Phillips, a senior, scored after he played a pass from Jacob Conrad and fired a shot from 19 yards out. “That second goal was incredible,” Kidd said. “I really like the urgency our kids showed in trying to get the ball down the field for one last opportunity, and we took advantage of that opportunity, which is great. We’ve been taking advantage of those scoring opportunities this year in tight games.” The Pirates were never in any real danger of losing their edge in the second half, but for good measure Meyer, a senior, made it 3-0 with 23:07 left in the game when he scored off an assist from Edward Radley. Gunner Tootle had delivered a free kick from midfield, only to have it bobbled by the goalkeeper and squirt back to Radley, who played it from the right side to Meyer, who finished the chance. Three goals were plenty for Swansboro to emerge victorious. The Pirates only allowed one second-half shot, that coming in the middle of the half. “We don’t like letting people get behind us and we like to put pressure on the ball,” Kidd said. “Players like (White Oak’s Gabe Krueger), he’s a fantastic player and you need to know where he is at all times. When they moved him up front, we definitely keyed on him more, but we know they have other players who can hurt us, too.” White Oak’s most dangerous shot came with nine minutes remaining in the first half when Cameron Powers had a running shot from the left side and from inside the 18-yard-line. However, it was blocked by a kick save by Swansboro goalkeeper Kyle McGovern. The Vikings’ only other first-half shot came on a 30-yard direct kick saved by McGovern. “It definitely helps having Kyle,” Gunner Tootle said. “Our defense tends to play four in the back, and me and Cam (Underseth) can shift. There’s a lot of communication on defense.” White Oak 0 0 – 0 Swansboro 2 1 – 3 GOALS –S: Rickards, Phillips, Meyer. ASSISTS –S: Ca. Tootle, Conrad, Radley. IN GOAL –W: Trimble (5 saves).
