It came down to a pair of talented Hammond seniors, Brittney Desmond and Maggie Herring, outlasting two Ashley Hall freshmen, Michaela Cuoco and Rebecca Spratt, in the No. 1 doubles match to decide the issue. After easily conquering the smallish Cuoco and 6-foot Spratt in the top two singles positions, Desmond and Herring held off the Cuoco/Spratt team, 6-3, 4-6, 10-6, to give the Columbia area its first state title since 2007 when Heathwood Hall defeated another Ashley Hall team. “Our two freshmen fought back to win the second set, but could not pull out the tiebreaker,” Ashley Hall coach Mary Gastley said as she wrapped up her 30th season as the Panthers’ coach. “We fought hard to the end. One match didn’t determine the state championship.” This was the sixth state final in nine years for Ashley Hall (15-5). “It was a great experience for our underclassmen,” Gastley said. The Panthers tied things at 4-4 when senior McCrae Nistad and sophomore Hannah Reuter teamed up at No. 3 doubles to duplicate their one-sided individual wins at Nos. 5 and 6 singles over Hammond’s Franny Masella and McKenzie Turner. In the only tightly contested singles match, Ashley Hall senior No. 3 Gyles Laney pulled out a third-set tiebreaker victory to join Nistad and Reuter in victory lane to send the match into doubles deadlocked at 3-3.
