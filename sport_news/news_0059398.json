As long as we defend well and score goals then the balance is right.\" \nArsenal are now third in Group F, but still need other results to go their way to be certain of reaching the knockout stages. \n\"We had an absolute necessity to win the game and we did it in an intense and disciplined way,'' said Wenger. \n''It was a top-level game between two top-level teams. Bayern had more possession than us, but we decided to make it tight in our final third and catch them on the break. \n\"Overall we have beaten a very strong team and kept a good level focus from the first to the last minute and kept a clean sheet as well.'' \nWenger added: ''We (still) need a result at Bayern. Now let's focus on Everton (in the Premier League on Saturday).'' \nPep Guardiola, who had not seen his Bayern side lose inside 90 minutes this season, refused to blame Neuer's flap for costing Bayern a result in London and was pleased with what his injury-hit team produced. \n''Never in my life have I criticised a player for taking decisions if correct or not correct. We did not lose because of Manuel Neuer. This is football and he took a decision in that situation - that is it,\" Guardiola said. \n''I'm so proud of my team. I like to win so I'm not happy but we played with a lot of courage to come here and take the ball off of the Arsenal players.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:16:25.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
