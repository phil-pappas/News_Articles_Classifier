Indiana State, ranked No. 24 in the Football Championship Subdivision, dominated after the Bears’ promising start for a 56-28 victory Saturday at Plaster Stadium. \nQuarterback Matt Adam passed for 265 yards and four touchdowns as the Sycamores improved to 3-1 and the Bears fell to 1-3 in the league opener for both. \nThe Sycamores opened the second half with a methodical, 70-yard touchdown drive for open a 28-14 lead. Adam’s 5-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Main finished it off, with Indiana State using a no-huddle, fast-tempo approach to keep the defense on its heels. \nMissouri State quickly went three-and-out and Indiana State responded with another touchdown drive to take a three-touchdown lead midway through the third quarter. \nIt appeared the fast tempo wore down the Missouri State defenders. On Adam’s 15-yard touchdown pass to Sampson Levingston, the receiver slipped four tackles to get into the end zone. \nThe Bears got a spark late in the third quarter as Deion Holliman returned a punt 58 yards for a touchdown, cutting the lead to 35-21. \nThe jolt of momentum didn’t last. Brodie Lambert’s pass was intercepted on the Bears’ next possession and, on the next play, Indiana State receiver Gary Owens took a lateral and threw 22 yards to Jamar Brown. \nIndiana State led 42-21 three plays into the fourth quarter, and many of the remaining fans were on their way to the exits. \nAdam added his fourth touchdown pass a few minutes later, 17 yards to Robert Tonyan for a 49-21 lead. \nThe game began with visions of an upset for the Bears, who led 14-7 one play into the second quarter after Calan Crowder’s second short touchdown run. They had a 161-28 advantage in total offense at the time. \nBut Indiana State led 21-14 by halftime and continued its dominance into the third quarter. \nThe Bears grabbed a 14-7 lead on Crowder’s second 2-yard touchdown run, on the first play of the second quarter. \nThe 80-yard drive was kick-started by a fake punt from the Bears’ 21. Punter Chris Sullens tucked the ball and ran 38 yards, to the Indiana State 41. \nLater, receiver Malik Earl took a reverse 17 yards to the Indiana State two, setting up Crowder’s short scoring run. \nAt that point, the Bears were controlling the game. But things began to changed. \nAfter calling time out and sending kicker Eric Heidorn onto the field — only to do a U-turn — the Sycamores went for it on 4th-and-2 from the Missouri State 19. Roland Genesy busted two tackles after picking up the first down and ran for a game-tying touchdown. \nIndiana State drove 88 yards before the half to break the tie. It got two third-down conversions along the way with Adam’s 6-yard pass to Gary Owens make it a 21-14 game. \nThe Bears took a 7-0 lead with its best drive of the season, covering 76 yards on 10 plays, with Crowder scoring from two yards out. \nThe drive included a successful conversion on 4th-and-3 from the Indiana State 38 with Lambert connecting with LeMarcus Stewart for a 23-yard gain. \nIndiana State tied on Tyler Denton’s 42-yard punt-return touchdown, a bizarre-looking play as the Bears’ cover team out-ran Sullens’ 24-yard punt into the wind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:15:24.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
