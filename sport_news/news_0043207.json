It’s $200 for newcomers. \nHubbard said the recreation program is a good fit for girls who are new to the sport. \nThe fun day builds on recent success that Hockey Brandon has had in growing the sport in the city. \nThe city will ice three atom teams for the first time this winter and has 30 girls in novice and 26 signed up for rec hockey, which is open to girls born from 2006 to 2010. \n“It’s really at the bottom end that it’s exploding,” Hubbard said. “That’s what we wanted. A couple of years ago we sat down and said what do we have to do and decided that we needed to get huge numbers in our younger age groups, which gives us something that we can build the program with.” \nBrandon currently fields one team in each of the peewee, bantam and midget age groups, numbers that could grow in the future. \n“We realized that we need to get girls playing with girls right off the bat at a young age,” Hubbard said. “They don’t have to go and play with the boys. They can wait until our girls’ program starts in atom and then they go right into our girls’ program. It gets them into an environment where they feel comfortable with other girls.” \nThe fun day falls during the fifth annual World Girls’ Hockey Weekend, a global initiative by the International Ice Hockey Federation to introduce girls to the game and to celebrate the rapidly growing sport. \nWhile there are an increasing number of scholarship opportunities in Canada and the United States, Hubbard said that’s not the focus for Hockey Brandon. \n“That’s a small part of the whole thing,” Hubbard said. “It’s getting the girls out and having fun and competing and then hopefully making it a lifelong sport. Like everybody else, we all end up in rec hockey as we get older and we just want the girls as they become women to still play the sport.” \nTo register, call Hockey Brandon’s office at 204-726-3550. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:36:31.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
