Meuse/The Journal New) Story Highlights Rockland Boulders catcher and outfielder Joe Maloney signed with the Twins on Tuesday. Maloney was named the Can-Am League player of the year this season. Maloney hit .337 this year with 14 HR, 83 RBIs, 123 hits and a league-record 91 runs. Maloney is the fourth Boulder since 2014 to sign with an MLB organization. 2 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nComing off the best individual season in franchise history, Rockland Boulders catcher and outfielder Joe Maloney was signed by the Minnesota Twins organization Tuesday, the Boulders announced. \nMaloney, 25, became the first Boulder to take home Can-Am League player of the year honors after a dominating offensive season that included a .337 average, 14 home runs, 83 RBIs, 123 hits, 33 doubles and a league-record 91 runs. \nThe right-handed slugger had labrum surgery following the team's championship run last season and never cooled off this year. \nMaloney homered twice in the season-opener and remained among the league's top hitters all season, finishing second in batting average after posting a respectable .271 mark last year. \nMaloney is the first member of the 2015 Boulders to sign with a Major League organization. He's the fourth member of the 2014 championship squad to do so, joining Steve Nyisztor (Diamondbacks), Joey Donino (Diamondbacks) and Sean Bierman (Orioles). \nWith Minnesota's farm teams now in the offseason, Maloney likely won't be assigned to a team until spring training next March.
