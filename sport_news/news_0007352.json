But everybody saw how ready they are and that’s the most important thing.” \nFollowing a dreary goalless stalemate in Sunday’s Manchester derby at Old Trafford, Manchester City and Manchester United continue their League Cup campaigns on Wednesday. \nUnited entertain second-tier Middlesbrough, while City welcome Crystal Palace to the Etihad Stadium. \nAntonio Valencia is a doubt for United after manager Louis van Gaal revealed that the right-sided Ecuadorian player sustained a foot injury against City, which saw him replaced by Matteo Darmian late in the game. \nThe point earned at Old Trafford took City back to the top of the table above Arsenal, but Arsene Wenger’s side otherwise had little to complain about following a week in which they resurrected their Champions League campaign by beating Bayern Munich 2-0 and then defeated Everton 2-1. \n“It is a perfect week and it is not easy to have that,” said the Arsenal manager, whose team visit second-tier Sheffield Wednesday. \n“The only negative is that we lost some players through injury during the week, but I will have to rest some players Tuesday night (tomorrow night) against Sheffield. I think for some players it will be one game too many for them.” \nAston Villa will begin life without Tim Sherwood, sacked as manager on Sunday, with a trip to Southampton, where Under-21 coach Kevin MacDonald will be in temporary charge of the visitors. \nLeicester City, fifth in the Premier League after a 1-0 win over Palace, travel to Championship side Hull City, while Everton host Norwich City in one of the five all-top-flight ties. \nFixtures (1945 GMT unless otherwise stated) \nTomorrow: \nHull City v Leicester City, \nSheffield Wednesday v Arsenal,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:43:33.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
