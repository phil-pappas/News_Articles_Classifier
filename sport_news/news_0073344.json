You can even say, 'You know what, kid, unfortunately you blew it.' It stops there. The fact that you're making threats against his life, and making a concern for his personal safety - that crosses the line.\" \nMichigan State didn't celebrate for long. \nJalen Watts-Jackson -- the player who scored the game-winning touchdown -- dislocated his hip on the play. He underwent surgery and will be out for the rest of the season. \nThe Spartans are still very much in contention for the College Football Playoff -- with the big one against Ohio State toward the end of November.
