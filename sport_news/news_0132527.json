In some places media personnel were also attacked, we have seen the video footages.\n“We have asked the police to take necessary action,” he said.\nAccusing TMC of unleashing a reign of terror to loot votes in the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, CPI(M) called 12-hour bandh in Bidhannagar-Rajarahat area on Monday protesting against alleged violence and malpractices.\nAnnouncing his party’s decision to call a bandh on Monday, CPIM leader Gautam Deb said, “We will organise protest march tomorrow against rigging and malpractices by TMC. They are trying to take away the democratic rights of the masses”.\nWhen asked whether the SEC would toy with the idea of repolling in various wards where there have been allegations of malpractices, Upadhaya said, “These are allegations.

Then only we can take an action and prepare report.”\nSenior officials of SEC and state police said there were reports of outsiders trying to jam booths in various wards of Bidhannagar and Asansol municipal corporations.\n“There were reports of bombs being hurled in Jamuria and Bidhanagar and people being stopped from casting their votes.\n“We are taking stock of the stutation,” an official said.\nFew media personnel were also beaten up while covering the incidents of malpractices.\nThe polls are a precursor to next year’s assembly elections in Bengal with ruling Trinamool Congress and its arch rival Left Front once again pitted against each other. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:38:20.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
