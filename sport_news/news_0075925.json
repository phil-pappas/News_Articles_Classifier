By Monday afternoon, Koppu had weakened into a tropical storm over Ilocos Norte province with winds of 105 kilometers (65 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 135 kph (84 mph).\nSeveral of the affected provinces, led by Nueva Ecija, were inby floods that swelled rivers and cascaded down mountains, trapping villagers in their homes, said Nigel Lontoc of the Office of Civil Defense.\n\"There were people who got trapped by the flood on their roofs, some were rescued already,\" Vice Mayor Henry Velarde of Nueva Ecija's Jaen town told The Associated Press by telephone, adding that about 80 percent of 27 villages in his farming town of more than 45,000 people were inby flood.\nWhen a flooded river swamped the villages, residents scrambled to safety but many failed to save their poultry and farm animals. Out of more than 5,000 ducks, for example, only about 1,000 were saved and many rice crops ready to be harvested in a few weeks turned into a muddy waste, he said.\n\"Our rice farms looked like it was ran over by a giant flat iron,\" Velarde said. \"All the rice stalks were flattened in one direction.\"\nHundreds of soldiers, police and volunteers have converged on Nueva Ecija, a landlocked, rice-growing province in the heart of Luzon island, to help villagers whose homes had been flooded, said Lontoc.\nErwin Jacinto, a 37-year-old resident of Nueva Ecija's Santa Rosa town, said the flooding turned his farmland into \"nothing but mud.\"\nJacinto spoke from atop a high bridge where dozens of farmers stayed in the open overnight with their families, and their pigs, goats and chickens.\nAt least 11 people have died. One man was buried by a landslide while checking his farm on Sunday in the mountain town of Bakun in Benguet province. Two men drowned in Nueva Ecija, while a 14-year-old boy was killed when a tree branch fell on his family's shanty in suburban Quezon city in metropolitan Manila.\nSeven people died when a passenger motorboat capsized in bad weather in the central Philippines, but the government's disaster-response agency has not included the deaths in the typhoon toll because the central region was not directly affected by the storm.\nPresident Benigno Aquino III, who flew to Nueva Ecija to check the flooding and distribute food packs in an emergency shelter, said the typhoon's unusually slow speed allowed it to batter the north for about three days instead of just a few hours.\nRain dumped by the typhoon in the north may rampage through rivers late Monday to Tuesday and put at risk about 800 downstream villages, where residents have been urged not to return home. \"They think it is safe already to go back to their communities but we are preventing them right now,\" Aquino told reporters.\nKoppu, Japanese for \"cup,\" is the 12th storm this year to hit the Philippines, which averages 20 storms and typhoons each year.\nIn 2013, Typhoon Haiyan leveled entire towns in the central Philippines and left more than 7,300 people dead or missing.\nAssociated Press writers Jim Gomez, Teresa Cerojano and Oliver Teves in Manila contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
