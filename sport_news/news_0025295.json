It’s my fault. I’m the head coach,” he said at a news conference announcing his departure. \nSpurrier said he started thinking about resigning Sunday morning, spoke to South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner that afternoon and told his team on Monday night that he was stepping down, effective immediately. \nSpurrier said he felt he needed to step down because he doesn’t believe there is accountability with players if they know the coach won’t be back next year. He also said he was a recruiting liability. \nHe has never had a losing season in 25 years as a college coach, with stops at Duke from 1987 to 1989, at Florida from 1990 through 2001, and at South Carolina, where he has been since 2005. \nSouth Carolina president Harris Pastides said he asked the coach to stay through the rest of the season, but Spurrier declined. \n“[It’s] time for me to get out of the way and let someone else have a go at it,” Spurrier said. “I was the best coach for this job 11 years ago, but I’m not today.” \nThe Gamecocks are 2-4, and Spurrier is 0-4 in the SEC for the first time in his 23 seasons coaching in the conference. \nOffensive line coach and co-offensive coordinator Shawn Elliott will replace Spurrier as South Carolina’s coach. The Gamecocks host Vanderbilt (2-3, 0-2) on Saturday. \n“Our team is not in shambles, as some might say,” Elliott said. “Not sure the change is what they’ve needed, but the change is what they’ve got. Going to do everything we can to make the University of South Carolina proud of this football program.” \nSpurrier considered leaving last December after the Gamecocks went 6-6 in the regular season, but the team beat Miami in the Independence Bowl, a victory that seemed to re-energize him. \nHe said this summer he planned to coach two or three more years, then extended that to four or five years when several recruits who had committed to South Carolina backed away before signing day in February. \nThen in July, Spurrier held a defiant news conference, telling Gamecocks fans not to listen to “enemies” questioning his commitment level or implying he could no longer effectively coach at his age. \n“We haven’t lost it,” Spurrier said in the summer. “We’ve got a dang good team.” \nThings have quickly spiraled downward this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:53:31.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
