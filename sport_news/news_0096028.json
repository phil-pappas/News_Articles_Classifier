We’re TV; that would drive viewers nuts.”\nAnd yet …\nThroughout this NFL season and MLB postseason (and now every NFL and MLB season), self-evident, not-worth-a-word occurrences — a ball bounced foul — have been described then dissected: What caused it, what the batter had in mind, what the pitcher had in mind, what might, could or should have happened, what now might, could, should happen.\nThat distracting, computerized strike-zone boxes with dots indicating the location of previous pitches? They appear as if, given the time or inclination to study them, we would discover pitcher or batter choosing the right answer when both would be happy not to choose the wrong one. And yet how were we able to watch baseball before it?\nOr should we recognize the importance of where the first pitch was thrown in relation to the coming seventh pitch?\nWhy simply tell us a pitcher “relies on his fastball” when we can read a box giving his percentage of fastballs, curves and changeups thrown this year? What happened to those pitches, and under what circumstances? Not important. What about sliders? Mmmm, White Castle sliders …\nMuch of what TBS’s Cal Ripken “analyzed” throughout the Mets-Cubs NLCS either was self-evident or very self-evident.\nThis came Wednesday, after Yoenis Cespedes swung and missed at a 3-1 curve: “That was a good breaking ball. Started out in the strike zone, kinda broke to the outside edge. But Cespedes still had a pretty good swing. If that ball hangs inside, he’s going to have a good strong swing against it, but because it’s just a bit outside, he misses it.”\nYeah, Cespedes and 150,000 previous batters.\nCal Ripken Jr. Photo: Getty Images Yet such silence-worthy analysis apparently met with TBS’s approval and encouragement.\nAnd yet, again, FOX is disinclined to save Harold Reynolds from both us and Harold Reynolds. Though he’s eager to please and enlighten, he talks until he’s third-inning background noise, drowned in his own gumbo.\nOn Wednesday, FOX showed us that the high-fly home run by the Blue Jays’ Chris Colabello carried a “projected 410 feet” with an “exit velocity of 108 mph.” Are we in coach or business class?\nSay, is 108 mph good? Bad? Where does he rank in team, AL East, AL, MLB exit velocity? Postseason exit velocity history? It was a home run. Can’t it be left at that? Silly question; I apologize.\nIn its second expedition to compete with ESPN, FOX again has chosen to emulate what makes ESPN perversely comical and just plain bad. Aping ESPN’s transparently pathetic sense of sports, FOX, late this season, added Pete Rose, then, for the postseason, Alex Rodriguez — both synonymous with placing themselves and the game in disrepute. Oh, how bold, how edgy!\nFOX Sports 1, as does ESPN, selects, rewards and serves rotten apples. What kind of thinking is at work? The sustained sale of “attitude” to young males has no discernible upside — quite the contrary — and yet it’s sustained. What TV execs wouldn’t want for their families — “Son, admire Pete Rose and Alex Rodriguez” — they want for yours.\nFS1 rushed to hire Randy Moss as lead studio NFL analyst. Despite his enormous talent, he was so insufferably selfish (and with an arrest record) that he was expendable to college teams, then six NFL teams.\nRandy Moss Photo: Getty Images And yet, DirecTV hired him to push NFL packages, starring him in a commercial in which he proudly walks a hallway lined with framed jerseys of all the teams for which he played! Then again, Bob Dylan now appears in an IBM commercial.\nThere are no better ideas, no better plan than to fuel another generation of desensitized “fans,” only this one eager to tweet vulgar hatred to and about punters for dropping the snap.\nESPN, long in the habit of hiring analysts of unknown value just to fill a studio, on Wednesday jettisoned 350 employees. They had no choice, according to boss John Skipper.\nTwo days earlier, ESPN circulated a release boasting of the “espnW Sports Summit” (espnW is a women’s-issues division) for three days at the St. Regis Monarch Beach Hotel in Dana Point, Calif., an expensive, five-star hotel 21 miles from the nearest airport.\nCall me a summit pooper, but with ESPN about to end 350 careers, couldn’t it have conducted espnW’s essential business from an airport hotel, or even via conference call?\nOne recent “shocker” was the alleged floating brothel provided Louisville basketball student-athlete, full-scholarship recruits. Louisville does offer an undergraduate degree in Women’s and Gender Studies.\nShocking? You tell me. Wouldn’t it have been more shocking if the recruits had been found visiting the library? Seriously.\nNaturally, Rick Pitino, paid millions to coach but not to know, didn’t know. American colleges’ highest paid, by many multiples, mentors of young men — including Roy Williams, Larry Brown and Joe Paterno — had not knowing in common. Sports ensure that knowledge and college are at odds.\nThe state of TV-moneyed college football and basketball is so thoroughly corrupt that to be shocked by anything — including full-scholarship recruits accused of murder — is to be blissfully stupid. It’s a daily, national epidemic enacted by our colleges fronting across-the-board fraud.\nAnd yet …\nOn Tuesday’s ESPN “Mike & Mike” show, Mike Greenberg asked a regular guest what he thought of the Louisville story. He asked ESPN’s Cris Carter, who had advised NFL rookies to lie to police and to pay one of their “crew” to take the rap, given that many would be arrested.\nAnd yet, the next day, 350 ESPN employees — excluding Carter — lost their jobs.\nPlaying with swagger nothing to shout about \nGiven the bag we’re in — the media’s frightened panderers publicly endorsing or excusing what they privately loathe — it only made sense that the Blue Jays’ Jose Bautista, following his excessive post-home-run bat-flip versus the Rangers in the ALDS, would be a debatable issue.\nIt brings to thought those who first excused (and still excuse) spray-painted graffiti — vandalized property — as “street art.” Common sense tells us neither “artist” nor the indulgent would enjoy having their homes or businesses involuntarily selected by “street artists.”\nThose who would publicly excuse or advocate excessive displays of self-regard — “playing with swagger” — should immediately be asked if they would encourage such from the kids in their lives.\nIf we’re to support, defend or excuse acts of rank immodesty, as good — as TV “cool” or even a matter of acceptable personal preference — then let’s cut to the core and declare immodesty as worth its weight it in “goal.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under cal ripken jr. ,  equal time ,  espn ,  fox sports ,  rick pitino", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:14:39.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
