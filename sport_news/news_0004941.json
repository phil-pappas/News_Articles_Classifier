Kevin Garnett took to his former coach’s parking spot.\nThe Minnesota power forward, who began his career under Saunders in 1995, the duo helping to turn around the then-pitiful Wolves into a perennial playoff team, left practice after hearing Saunders had passed away, at age 60, after a battle with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\nGarnett, who grew with Saunders — ’95 was the coach’s debut season and Garnett’s first year in the NBA, straight out of high school — headed to the parking garage of the Minnesota practice facility. He sat in the empty spot of the man who helped nurture the future Hall of Famer and posted a picture on Facebook with the message, “Forever in my heart …”\nDespite a no-trade clause with the Nets, Garnett agreed to a trade to the Timberwolves last season in part for a reunion with Saunders, who ran the show in Minnesota. The 39-year-old Garnett, still effective if not nearly the player he once was, put off retirement this offseason to sign a two-year deal with the Timberwolves, likely envisioning finishing his career with the man he began it with.\nSaunders announced he was battling cancer in June, though it was termed “treatable and curable” at the time. Sunday, Saunders lost that battle, and Garnett lost a friend.\n  flip saunders ,  kevin garnett ,  minnesota timberwolves", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:03:22.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
