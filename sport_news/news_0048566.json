LOUIS - The Chicago Cubs won’t publicly say it.\nAdChoices They are confident, and brash at times, but they’ve got too much respect for the St. Louis Cardinals to utter the words out loud.\nYet, they’ll let you in on a little secret.\nThey are just one victory away from reaching the National League Championship Series, and five wins from the World Series, after their 6-3 victory Saturday over the Cardinals.\nOh, sure, the official statistics will show you that the NL Division Series is tied at 1-apiece, with the Series resuming Monday, where the Cubs will try to win their first postseason game at Wrigley since 2003.\nBut who’s kidding who?\nThe Cubs can’t help but feel they’re up, 2-1, in this best-of-five series, with Game 3 being nothing more than a formality.\nYou see, they’ve got Jake Arrieta on the mound Monday, and the only time he has lost since June 16, it took a no-hitter to beat him. Why, since Cole Hamels’ no-hitter against the Cubs on July 25, the man has been unconscious.\nHe is 11-0 with a 0.41 ERA since the end of July, which is the lowest ERA by a pitcher since the statistic was even invented.\n“You can’t get ahead of yourself,’’ Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said, “but we are very confident. We are a different ball club with him on the mound. He sets the tone.\n“That’s a great team though, they find ways to win against any pitcher, at any time.’’\nStill, on this night, the Cardinals couldn’t beat Kyle Hendricks, and were shut down by the Cubs’ shaky bullpen.\nReally, they beat themselves, with a five-run meltdown in the second inning that had the Cubs giggling, and the Cardinals moaning.\nThe Cardinals threw the ball into the stands. And into right field. Made bonehead decisions. And were careless.\nThe Cubs scored their first three runs without hitting the ball out of the infield, and then, just to show they could do something more than bunt, Jorge Soler hit a 407-foot homer off Jaime Garcia.\nTwo Cardinals errors. Two Cubs sacrifice-squeeze bunts. A home run. Ballgame.\nThe Cubs ranked next-to-last in the National League in sacrifice bunts. They didn’t have their first one until June. They actually had only two games the entire season when they had two sacrifice bunts.\nNow, for the first time, they did it back-to-back, with pitcher Kyle Hendricks and shortstop Addison Russell. Hendricks, in fact, became the first Cubs pitcher to score a run on a sacrifice bunt in a postseason game since the 1906 World Series when Ed Ruelbach’s bunt scored Joe Tinker.\nYeah, back in the good ol’ days of Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance.\n“That was fun, wasn’t it?’’ Cubs catcher David Ross said. “I was firing up the manager (Joe Maddon) after the first one, and then he did it again. I almost passed out I was yelling at him so much.\n“The manager pushed the right buttons, and we did the little things that we really haven’t done all year, I’m sure it took them by surprise.\n“I don’t know if I ever said, “The manager had a really good game. But I thought he had a really good game. Is that possible? Am I allowed to say that?’’\nWell, when you watched the power-hitting Cubs turn into bunting fools, hey, why not?\nIt’s an inning that could haunt the Cardinals all winter if they lose to the Cubs, and are eliminated in the first round.\nIt all started when Starlin Castro led off with a single up the middle. Austin Jackson grounded out to shortstop Jhonny Peralta, but when he flipped to second baseman Kolten Wong to start the double play, Wong lost control of the ball, and threw the ball 30 feet wide of first baseman Brandon Moss, bouncing into the stands.\nGarcia evidently forgot that Jackson was now on second base. Jackson took a lead so large he was almost in the state of Kansas, strolling to third for the stolen base.\nGarcia then walked catcher Miguel Montero, bringing up Hendricks, who will be the answer to a trivia question one day: Who was the first pitcher to bat eighth in a postseason game?\nMaddon called for a squeeze, and Hendricks laid down a bunt right in front of the pitcher’s mound. Jackson broke for home, and Garcia had an easy play at the plate. Yet, he didn’t even look at Jackson. He started to throw to first, hesitated when he heard everyone yell, looked too late to home, and then threw the ball 20 feet over the head of Moss into right field, with Montero advancing to third and Hendricks to second base.\nThe Cubs, figuring if it worked once, why not try it again, laid down another one with No. 9 hitter Addison Russell, scoring Hendricks. Dexter Fowler followed with a soft single, and Soler slammed him home.\n“It is hard to watch a club that’s played so well defensively,’’ Matheny said, “see a couple things happen that are kind of uncharacteristic for us.\n“But they do happen. We got to figure out ways to get around them.’’\nThe Cardinals’ blunders now leave them in a quandary with their starting rotation the rest of the series.\nThey will go with Michael Wacha, who may be the sacrificial lamb, Monday in Game 3. They were planning on starting Lance Lynn in Game 4, until Garcia departed after two innings with stomach flu. Lynn was called into the game in the third inning and pitched an inning of relief.\nSo if the Cardinals indeed lose Game 3, and officially fall down 2-1, they may have no choice but to turn to John Lackey on short rest. He threw just 86 pitches in his 7 1/3-inning shutout performance, but he’s also 36 years old.\n“I don’t think we rule out anything,’’ Matheny said. “We’ll figure things out when we get to that point.’’\nThe Cubs will let the Cardinals stress about their pitching. They plan to leisurely show up at Wrigley Field on Sunday, with Maddon calling it “Breakfast at Wrigley,’’ telling everyone they’re invited.\n“We’re going to have some breakfast at Wrigley,’’ Maddon said, “enjoy our optional batting practice, watch some NFL football on the big screen, and then get ready for the next game.’’\nThe Cubs, even with reliever Travis Wood, who pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings calling Saturday’s game a “must-win,’’ didn’t even bother taking batting practice before the critical game.\nThey’re not even sure when they’ll bother taking it again.\nIf you’re a Cub, batting practice is always optional.\nOnly on this day, Fowler said, it wasn’t even optional, with Maddon telling everyone not to bother even stepping onto the field until game time.\nHey, when has Maddon ever done anything the conventional way?\n“We don’t worry about what people think,’’ Rizzo said. “We don’t want to prove anybody wrong.\n“We want prove ourselves right. We know how good we are.’’\nAnd, oh, man, are they ever having fun showing it.\n“I just can’t wait to hear that crowd at Wrigley,’’ Rizzo said. “With Jake on the mound, it’s already electric. And now that it’s 1-1 coming in? Huge game. It’s going to be electric.\n© Jeff Curry, USA TODAY Sports Jeff Curry, USA TODAY Sports “I can’t imagine how crazy it will be.’’\nNeither can anyone else.\nGALLERY: Cubs, Cards clash in NLDS\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:24:08.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
