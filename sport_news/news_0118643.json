Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: What percentage of the Dallas Cowboys' playbook do you believe that Cassel has a grasp of or access to?\nBabe Laufenberg: Can't say I can really put a percentage on it. The whole key is being able to react immediately to the situation. If you hesitate, even for a split second in your decision making, it is over. So his NFL experience is somewhat negated by his lack of experience in this offense. I am fond of the expression in all walks of life...\"You have to know it, and know you know it.\" We will find out very quickly how far along he is in that process.\nQuestion: Weeden had previously played pro baseball and things did not work out. Does being exposed to pro sports and perhaps having underachieved or not making it in baseball make him stronger going foward?\nBabe Laufenberg: I hear all the time how the experience of pro baseball helps these guys when they get to the NFL. Hardens them. I wholeheartedly disagree. I will give you the example of 3 QBs the Cowboys have signed, Chad Hutchinson, Drew Henson, and now, Brandon Weeden. All were extremely high picks in baseball, failed there, then came to the NFL (Weeden after going to OSU). They went to baseball and experienced failure in their athletic careers for the first time in their lives. When I looked at Hutchinson and Henson, I saw two fragile personalities that lacked confidence. They tasted their own blood in baseball and they didn't like it. QB is all about confidence...the confidence your teammates and coaches have in you, but most importantly, the confidence you have in yourself. That confidence has been shaken. I would look long and hard before I invested in a \"can't-miss-baseball prospect\" who failed in baseball to be my QB.\nQuestion: Do you feel like the Cowboys' pass rush is finally good enough with Hardy and Gregory coming back to make the difference for this team going forward?\nBabe Laufenberg: Absolutely. The first half against New England was beyond impressive. Five sacks of Tom Brady? Are you kidding me? Have never seen a rush just so completely envelop Brady like that. Say what you will about Hardy, but the man was born to rush the passer. Want more good news? The last time Hardy faced the Giants, he sacked Eli Manning 3 times. As for Gregory, for a rookie to be out as long as he has, don't know quite what to expect. The NFL is a technique game, and I just wonder how good his technique can possibly be after a long layoff. Oh, wait. Rod Marinelli is coaching him...he'll be fine.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nGeorge: In strange way, Tom Brady's 2008 injury could help Cowboys survive Romo-less stretch\nGeorge: The good and bad news about Matt Cassel replacing Weeden\nLaufenberg: Why Eli Manning might be losing sleep this week\nGeorge: Why trip to Ground Zero won't affect Cowboys' preparation for Giants\nWhat a collaboration between Cowboys, Nike will do to protect Dez Bryant on his return\nCowlishaw: A solution to nude NFL players on TV?
