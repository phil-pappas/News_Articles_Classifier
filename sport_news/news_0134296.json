But the majority of the players on this team are playing in prominent roles for the first time in their careers. \n“They’re selling themselves short,” head coach Jimbo Fisher said of his team. “They don’t have any clue. They don’t respect how good they really are. They don’t know how good they really are. They’re a really good team. If they relax and play, they can do anything they want to do. \n“At the end of the day, I could motivate you. I can talk to you. I can give you all the words of encouragement. At the end of the day, you got to make your mind up and do it.” \nQuarterback Everett Golson played his best game as a Seminole and star running back Dalvin Cook regrouped from two separate hamstring cramps in both halves to lead the charge. \nGolson played his best game as a Seminole, completing 26 of 38 passes for 378 yards and touchdown passes to Kermit Whitfield, Travis Rudolph and Ryan Izzo during the game. Whitfield led the Seminoles with nine catches for 172 yards, including a 70-yard score. Buy Photo Dalvin Cook rushes against Louisville during their game at Doak Campbell Stadium on Saturday.

Golson had 22 turnovers last season at Notre Dame. \n“He’s playing aggressive football, but smart football,” Fisher said of Golson. \nThe mission was to get Golson going early, but the offense struggled with Cook only getting seven carries in the first half. \nCook finished the game with 22 carries for 163 yards and two touchdowns in the third quarter. He also caught four passes for 60 yards. Clark: A storybook moment for former FSU walk-on Javien Elliott \n“I just got to do what I got to do,” said Cook, who is 45 rushing yards shy of 1,000 six games into his sophomore season. “When my number gets called, I got to take advantage of the moment. I might get that spark some games, and if that’s what the team needs, I’m going to do it. \nCook originally sustained the hamstring injury two weeks ago against Wake Forest, and recovered to score three touchdowns against Miami last week. He also came up lame during the Miami game as well. \nAnd as with every moment Cook heads to the sidelines after favoring his hamstring, all eyes concentrate on when he jumps off the FSU training table, puts his helmet on and gets back onto the field. \n“I just tried to get it before it gets too bad,” Cook said. “Most of the time late in the games, when I try to hit another gear, that’s when I really feel it. So I grab it before it gets any worse.” FSU’s Trey Marshall leaves Louisville game with arm injury \nLouisville's Lamar Jackson saw some success in the air, connecting with receiver James Quick for three touchdowns during the game. \nJackson, a freshman from Boynton Beach known for his ability to make plays outside the pocket with his feet, completed 20 of 35 passes for 307 yards and an interception. FSU’s defense kept him to only 32 yards rushing on 19 carries. \nFSU will now turn its attention to Georgia Tech for a road game next Saturday, which might not live up to its billing of an ACC title game rematch from last season. The Yellow Jackets (2-5, 0-4 ACC) fell at home 31-28 to Pittsburgh (5-1, 3-0 ACC) during the game.
