PAUL, Minnesota -- Minnesota beat Columbus 3-2 on Thursday to send the Blue Jackets to an eighth straight loss to start the new NHL season, with a change of coach doing nothing to arrest the losing spiral. \nColumbus' start is the worst season-opening regulation losing streak in the NHL since the New York Rangers lost their first 11 back in 1943-44. John Tortorella took over as coach Wednesday after Todd Richards was fired. \nElsewhere, Dallas extended its winning streak to five with victory at Pittsburgh, Chicago edged Florida, and a late Alex Ovechkin goal lifted Washington over Vancouver. \nMinnesota went ahead against Columbus when Zach Parise scored his sixth goal of the season. \nAlexander Wennberg and Brandon Dubinsky countered for Columbus, but Nino Niederreiter tied it and Thomas Vanek scored the winner with 8:48 left in the second period. \nDallas' Jason Spezza scored his fifth goal of the season as the Stars beat Pittsburgh 4-1 for their fifth straight victory. \nJohnny Oduya and John Klinberg scored their first goals of the season and Mattias Janmark also netted to help the Stars finish a perfect four-game trip. \nNick Bonino scored for the Penguins, who had won their previous three. \nChicago's Patrick Kane and Brent Seabrook each had a goal and two assists as the Blackhawks beat Florida 3-2. \nArtem Anisimov also scored for the Stanley Cup champions. \nJaromir Jagr and Vincent Trocheck scored for the Panthers, who have dropped three straight. \nWashington's Alex Ovechkin broke a tie with 4:55 left to secure a 3-2 win against Vancouver and a fourth successive victory. \nJay Beagle pulled Washington even at 5:42 of the third, and Ovechkin won it with his fifth goal of the season. Jason Chimera scored in the first for the Capitals, but Radim Vrbata and Henrik Sedin each had a goal and an assist in the second for Vancouver. \nNew York goaltender Henrik Lundqvist made 34 saves and Kevin Hayes broke a tie early in the third period as the Rangers defeated Arizona 4-1. \nLos Angeles' Jeff Carter scored twice and Jhonas Enroth made 39 saves in 4-1 win for the Kings against San Jose. \nNew Jersey's Lee Stempniak tied the game with 32 seconds left in regulation and added the shootout winner to lift the Devils over Ottawa 5-4. \nNashville's Colin Wilson and Ryan Ellis each had a goal and two assists and Pekka Rinne made 27 saves to lift the Predators past Anaheim 5-1.
