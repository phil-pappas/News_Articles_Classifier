The Blazers’ triple threat of Peonia, Lea Jaklen , and Antia Rodriguez-Sanchez teamed up for 13 of VSU’s 15 kills in the first set, resulting in a 25-19 win and a 1-0 lead. \nSydney Chick opened up the second set with a service ace, and the Blazers were off and running once again with a 10-4 run. The Blazers took advantage of a myriad of West Georgia miscues, while freshmen Ashley Miller , Sara Dandridge , Carly Smart , and Jenna Usry all contributed with at least one kill each to push the Blazers in front 2-0 with a 25-10 win. \nThe contributions of Miller and Dandridge extended to the defensive side, as the duo disrupted West Georgia’s offense with a combined effort that accounted for nine of VSU’s 19 total blocks in the contest. Natalia Campos also delivered a stellar defensive effort with a team high 25 digs. \nLooking to seal the match, the Blazers poured on in the third and final set to claim a 25-22 win. Miller, Peonia, Jaklen, and Rodriguez-Sanchez all closed out the match with hitting percentages above .300, and Rodriguez-Sanchez’s .538 (8 kills, 1 error, 13 attempts) performance nearly matched a career high of .565, which the junior posted in VSU’s previous match against UWG earlier this season. \nThe Blazers’ victory comes a day after they swept the West Alabama Tigers (25-18, 25-18, 25-13) in Livingston, Ala. \nVSU hit the ground running with a 6-2 run to open up the first frame before the Tigers answered with four straight points to tie the set up at 6-6. The Tigers even took an 8-7 lead moments later, before a kill by Miller and three UWA errors allowed the Blazers to reclaim an 11-8 advantage. VSU never trailed again in the set and posted a 14-10 run to win 25-18 and take a 1-0 match lead. \nThe second set progressed in similar fashion, with UWA taking an early 8-6 lead before allowing the Blazers to retake a 16-10 lead with a 10-2 run. The Tigers regained their composure and used three kills, a service ace, and a Blazer attack error to pull to within one point, but the Blazers answered with six straight points to open up a 22-17 lead. Two service errors surrounded one last point for West Alabama and preceded a booming set point kill by Jaklen , who recorded 15 kills on the night and finished with a career-high .789 hitting percentage. \nIn the third and final set, Valdosta State completely dominated the frame to cap off the match with a 25-13 victory. Miller put the finishing touches on the closing set with one of six kills in the match. All but one of the freshman’s seven swings in the contest resulted in kills, which resulted in a .714 hitting percentage for Miller. \nWith the pair of wins, VSU improves to 17-5 overall and 12-2 in GSC play, while the Wolves fell to 3-19 overall. and were left searching for their first conference win at 0-14. \nNext up for the Blazers, it’s another GSC showdown against the visiting Lee Flames at The Complex on Friday at 6 p.m., followed by another 6 p.m. showdown at home against Shorter the following day.
