Agent Alan Middleton was fined 30,000 pounds ($46,000). \nThe written reasons for the sanctions describe the transfer as a classic case of “fronting”, where an unauthorized and unlicensed agent was involved. \nArsenal says it “acted in good faith throughout in this transfer and had no reason to believe that the player’s representative was not authorized to be involved in the transfer negotiations.” \nBut the London club says it has “improved our procedures to prevent this happening again.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:03:35.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
