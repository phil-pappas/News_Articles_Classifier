(AP) - Arkansas’ Sebastian Tretola has been named the Southeastern Conference offensive lineman of the week. \nTretola led an offensive line that did not allow a sack in the Razorbacks’ 24-20 win over Tennessee on Saturday. The senior from San Bernardino, California, played left guard for all 73 snaps in Saturday’s game. \nThe team says Tretola helped Alex Collins and Rawleigh Williams III both get more than 100 yards in rushing. It’s the first time a duo has done so in a conference game since Darren McFadden and Felix Jones did it in 2007. \nArkansas plays at No. 8 Alabama on Saturday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:02:30.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
