MARK HALL 614-425-7471 \nPinkman won Saturday's $527,000 Kentucky Futurity for 3-year-old trotters at Red Mile, biding his time through the early portions of the race before taking the lead in the stretch and posting a 11/4-length victory over long shot Crescent Fashion in 1:51.2. \nFrench Laundry finished third. \nThe triumph gave trainer Jimmy Takter a sweep of the Kentucky Futurity and the Kentucky Filly Futurity for 3-year-old female trotters. Wild Honey upset 1-9 favorite Mission Brief in the Kentucky Filly Futurity by three-quarters of a length in 1:50.4. \nPinkman's win in the Kentucky Futurity gave the gelding two jewels of the Trotting Triple Crown. In August, Pinkman won the Hambletonian Stakes at the Meadowlands. Habitat, who won the second leg of trotting's Triple Crown at Yonkers Trot, was not entered in the Futurity. \nPinkman is the 20th horse to win two legs of the Trotting Triple Crown, a feat most recently accomplished just last year by Takter's Nuncio. \n\"He's game,\" winning driver Yannick Gingras said about Pinkman. \"He always puts up a 100 percent effort. He's a winner and he wants to get it done.\" \nPinkman, who started from post nine, raced in third for nearly three-quarters of a mile before challenging leader Crazy Wow on the final turn. He pulled away from the field in the stretch before holding off Crescent Fashion to win the 123rd edition of the Kentucky Futurity. \n\"He's been an outstanding horse, just a fantastic horse, and I'm so proud of him,\" Takter said about Pinkman. \"(The Breeders Crown) is his next stop.\" \nPinkman, sent off at 2-1 odds, paid $6.20 to win. \nA gelding by Explosive Matter out of the mare Margie Seelster, Pinkman has won 11 of 15 races this year and earned $1.75 million. His other victories include the $532,000 Canadian Trotting Classic, $1 million Hambletonian, $500,000 Beal Memorial, and $370,000 Zweig Memorial. \nPinkman is owned by Christina Takter, John and Jim Fielding, Joyce McClelland and Herb Liverman. For his career, Pinkman has won 17 of 23 starts and $2.31 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:01:59.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
