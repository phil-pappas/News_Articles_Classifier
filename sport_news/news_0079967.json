Senior quarterback DJ Perdaems hit Bennett Hostetler for a 25-yard score midway through the first quarter, then Cade Wessel for 20 and a touchdown early in the second. \nThe Hawks extended the lead when Great Falls threw the ball on fourth and 2, but quarterback Kaden Sukut had his pass deflected by Wessel and intercepted by Brock Behan, who returned it 55 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead. \n“(The defense was) sound all around,” Purcell said. “The kids played really well and then our No. 2s got scored on at the end of the game, that kind of deal.” \nThe backups got plenty of work on this night. \nPerdaems scored finished off Bozeman’s first drive of the second half with a 3-yard touchdown run with 8 minutes, 20 seconds remaining in the period, ending a short but efficient evening of work for the starters on both sides of the ball. \nThat didn’t keep the Hawks from rolling up some gaudy numbers on the ground. Senior Trace Bradshaw finished with 140 yards on just eight carries, including a 76-yard rumble that set up a score in the first half’s waning moments. Balue Chapman finished with 88 total yards (41 rushing), including a 28-yard touchdown reception from Perdaems. Junior back Austin Hoell handled the workload late, gaining 36 on 11 carries. \nAll told, Bozeman ran for 260 yards, held the Bison to 59 and posted a 390-186 advantage in total offense. The Hawks didn’t punt until the closing minutes of the third quarter. \nThe visitors did commit 12 penalties, but otherwise dominated across the board. \n“The coaching’s doing a great job,” Purcell said. “If things are working real smooth, that means there’s just a good combination of people working together.” \nThe Hawks play their final two regular season games at Van Winkle Stadium, and would ensure they don’t make another road trip this season with wins over Great Falls CMR and Billings Skyview. \n“You look past anybody in high school football and you could be on the outside looking in,” Purcell said. “We just have to take care of business each week.” \nStill, he admitted his team has put itself in great position, and at this late point in the season it’s not worth denying that the No. 1 seed is there for the taking. \n“Any loss on the way and you’re sacrificing home field advantage throughout,” he said. “It’s out in the future, but it’s definitely a realistic goal that we can accomplish.” \nParker Gabriel can be reached at pgabriel@dailychronicle.com or 582-2690.
