UEFA said the players are still level at 323. \n\"I'm very happy,\" Ronaldo said. \"First of all because the team won. But I won't lie to you. I really wanted to beat Raul's record.\" \nRonaldo said Raul had sent him a message of congratulations. \nThe Portuguese forward took his Champions League record tally to 82 goals, five more than Lionel Messi. \n\"We are happy with Cristiano Ronaldo's goals,\" defender Alvaro Arbeloa said. \"It's incredible what he's doing. He is a legend in Real Madrid. It seems there is no limit to what he can do.\" \nHere is a look at Wednesday's Champions League matches: \nGroup A \nRonaldo ensured Real Madrid kept its share of the Group A lead, along with Paris Saint-Germain. \nThe Portugal forward scored in the 29th and 90th minutes against Malmo, which played with 10 men from the 78th as left back Yoshimar Yotun was sent off with a second yellow card. \nSwedish police said 20 Madrid supporters were detained for disorderly conduct before the match. \nPSG eased to a 3-0 win at Shakhtar after defender Serge Aurier scored a goal and set up another. \nThe Ivory Coast right back headed in PSG's opener in the seventh minute and served up a corner kick for David Luiz to make it 2-0 in the 23rd. \nPSG sealed victory when Zlatan Ibrahimovic unleashed a shot that ricocheted off Shakhtar captain Darijo Srna and flew into the net as an own goal in the 90th. \nGroup B \nAll four Group B teams are now level on three points after Manchester United defeated Wolfsburg 2-1 in England and CSKA Moscow edged PSV Eindhoven 3-2 at home. \nJuan Mata scored one goal and set up another as United rallied to win its first group match. Daniel Caligiuri put Wolfsburg ahead after four minutes, but Mata won and converted a penalty to equalize before halftime and Chris Smalling slotted the ball past Diego Benaglio to seal the win in the 53rd. \nIn Russia, Seydou Doumbia scored twice as CSKA held off a second-half comeback by PSV. CSKA led 3-0 at halftime but PSV bounced back with two goals from Maxime Lestienne and had chances to level the score late. \nGroup C \nBenfica moved into a comfortable position atop Group C with the surprise 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid , opening a three-point advantage after two matches. \nBenfica has six points and Atletico has three, while Galatasaray and Astana, which drew 2-2 in Kazakhstan earlier Wednesday, have one point each. \nAtletico Madrid went ahead with Angel Correa in the 23rd, but Argentine midfielder Nicolas Gaitan equalized in the 36th and Goncalo Guedes put the Portuguese champions ahead in the 51st. Brazilian World Cup veteran goalkeeper Julio Cesar played well to keep the hosts from recovering. \nThere were three own goals in the match in Kazakhstan, including Astana's 89th-minute equalizer. It was the first game in the main stages of the Champions League to be held in the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan, which has been considered part of Europe for football purposes since 2002. \nGroup D \nJuventus and Manchester City cast aside their domestic woes to pick up important wins in the Champions League on Wednesday. \nJuventus stayed ahead in Group D by defeating Sevilla 2-0 in Italy, while City's first victory came at Borussia Moenchengladbach. \nAlvaro Morata equaled a Juventus club record by scoring in a fifth successive Champions League match to put last year's runner-up three points clear atop the group. Simone Zaza sealed the victory in the end. \nManchester City moved level with Sevilla after Sergio Aguero scored a last-minute penalty to help the Premier League side snatch a dramatic 2-1 victory in Germany. \nAguero was fouled by United States defender Fabian Johnson in the 89th and sent 'Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer the wrong way to secure the win. \nMoenchengladbach was playing European Cup football at home for the first time in 37 years. \nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:14:31.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
