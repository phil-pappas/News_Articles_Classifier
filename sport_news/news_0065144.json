A 16-yard run by Travon McMillian got the ball to the 45 with 56 seconds left.\nIt took a long of time before the Hokies got off another snap, with Michael Brewer hitting receiver Cam Phillips for a 5-yard pass to midfield with 27 seconds left. Phillips appeared to get out of bounds, but the official ruled him down by forward progress, keeping the clock moving.\n\"We thought the clock had stopped, and all of the sudden the clock was still running,\" head coach Frank Beamer said.\n\"I don't know how anybody didn't notice that the official said that he was inbounds,\" Brewer said. \"I don't know if that's a lack of communication or just nobody was looking.\"\nOffensive coordinator Scot Loeffler, who coaches from the press box, thought the play was out of bounds, thus stopping the clock, and looked down to his sheet to make a play call to get the ball to the 35-yard line to give the Hokies a shot at a reasonable field goal.\nThe clock ticked down to 8 seconds before the Hokies got off another snap. Brewer threw an incompletion that took it down to 2 seconds, leaving Tech with the option of a 67-yard field goal attempt or a Hail Mary.\nJoey Slye's 67-yard attempt at the gun fell 5 yards short.\nMcMillian has his best game at Virginia Tech \nRunning back Travon McMillian had career highs in carries (29), yards (142) and touchdowns (two) to lead the Hokies' rushing attack. It was his third straight game as Tech's primary running back. He's run for 96 or more yards in all three.\nMcMillian also had a clutch two-point conversion run to tie the game at the end of regulation and a 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth overtime to briefly give the Hokies the lead.\nAll that happened after McMillian had only five carries for 21 yards at halftime.\nWith Brewer back, Hodges takes over \nBrewer's return was a boon to tight end Bucky Hodges, the former Salem High star who had his best game to date with five catches for 101 yards and three touchdowns.\n\"Bucky's been the No. 1 target 90 percent of the plays,\" Loeffler said, noting that he's just been covered most of the season. \"We're going to throw to the open guy.\"\nReceiver Isaiah Ford had been that near the end zone in the past, but Hodges, who caught two or fewer passes in all but one game this year, seized the opportunities against Duke.\nIt aided Brewer's big day. He had 169 of his 270 passing yards and two of his three passing touchdowns after halftime.\n\"I told the TV people that I expected him to start a little bit slow in the first half because he hasn't played a bunch of live football in six weeks,\" Loeffler said. \"And I expected at the end of the game he'd be on fire and do what he does. And I think that occurred.\"\nVirginia Tech football Follow @AndyBitterVT \n\nMore Va.
