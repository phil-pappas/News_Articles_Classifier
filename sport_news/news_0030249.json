And the Broncos played only nine games in 1982 because of the strike.\nTheir 3.3-yards-per-carry average is the lowest since 1967's 3.0. Those dread-ball era Broncos went 3-11.\nLast Sunday, C.J. Anderson mucked for 22 yards on 11 attempts at Oakland; Ronnie Hillman got 21 yards on seven calls.\nThe Broncos' running game is despicable, especially considering that coach Gary Kubiak was selected for his post in part to produce a potent running game. The Broncos have run 108 times, passed on 309 plays.\nAfter the victory against Oakland, I asked Kubiak about the restless, rush-less Broncos, and why he abandoned trying to run the ball. He said he did so because of the defense the Raiders showed.\nGet used to it, Gary.\nThe Browns may put 10 men in the box.\nThe Great One asked me Wednesday night about the other great one. Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, who was visiting Denver, wondered about his friend Peyton Manning and why he was struggling. \"He's getting no help,\" I replied. Gretzky said: \"I feel for him.\"\nAdvertisement No help from an ordinary offensive line, pedestrian tight ends, a 70 Million-Dollar Man at wide receiver who is tied for first in just one NFL category, dropped passes (five), and two running backs who can't run and can't hide.\nPro Football Focus, which ranks every player, has Anderson at 108th and Hillman at 76th among running backs. Number 18 is ranked No. 27 at quarterback.\nPeyton is getting serious assistance only from left guard Evan Mathis (ranked 10th) and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders (ranked eighth), who has 34 catches for 418 yards and two touchdowns.\nKubiak says to put the blame on him for the team's lack of a running game.\nOK.\nWhen Kubiak was the Broncos' offensive coordinator, he and coach Mike Shanahan made chicken salad out of Mike Anderson and Olandis Gary. But C.J. Anderson, who was special last year, and Hillman are potted meat. Juwan Thompson has three rushes for 11 yards and can't stay healthy. Kapri Bibbs remains on the practice squad.\nWhat to do?\n\"We are committed to the run, and we will be,\" offensive coordinator Rick Dennison says.\nWell, no more flummery. Commit to it in Cleveland.\nThe Browns have been perforated for a jumbo-jet 747 yards, a 149.4 average in five games. They have allowed 154, 166, 155, 91 and181 yards rushing, the latter against Kubiak's former team (Baltimore). Nobody on the Browns' front seven could start for the Broncos' defense.\nKubiak must activate Bibbs, who ran out of a zone-blocking offense at Colorado State, and play him Sunday.\nGo with a two tight-end offense (including fresh body Richard Gordon), and utilize an extra wide body (Max Garcia) at the end of the line. Put Manning under center on run plays and let him play-action pass. Start Tyler Sambrailo again at left tackle and Tyler Polumbus at right tackle.\nThe Broncos must alternate their backs and run on first down, second down, even third down. When they aren't running out of the backfield, Kubiak has to mix in West Coast throws to the backs. The Broncos can't just try running for one quarter or two, and then discard the idea.\nAnd, if the running game doesn't succeed by midway through the fourth quarter, abandon hope.\nThen, do as fellow columnist Mark Kizsla has recommended: Turn to the hurry-up mode, let Peyton call the plays and wish for another greasy victory.\nIf the run game continues to fail? Go all-in during the bye week and before the trading deadline on Oct. 28, and offer a second-round draft choice to the Chicago Bears for Matt Forte or to the Philadelphia Eagles for DeMarco Murray.\nThe Orange must be a movable force against the Browns' penetrable object.\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or @woodypaige", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:27:17.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
