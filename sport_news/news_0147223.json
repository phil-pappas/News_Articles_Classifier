Although it will technically be a home game for the Gamecocks, it will be played in front of an LSU crowd in Tiger Stadium. \nWith the lack of a home-field advantage, the LSU marching band is doing everything it can to establish this feel for Steve Spurrier's team. \n'The Golden Band from Tigerland' will learn the South Carolina alma mater and fight song. These will be played during the pregame festivities within the stadium. In addition, all proceeds from ticket sales will be sent to South Carolina. \nWhile LSU is treating this contest as a home game for South Carolina, there are a few noteworthy specifics pertaining to the game. \nThe field will not be painted with South Carolina colors, in large part to LSU's game the following week at home versus Florida. With the shortage of USC fans expected at the game, the East and South upper decks have been shut down. \nLSU also plans on making a separate contribution to South Carolina for the floor relief efforts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:42:56.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
