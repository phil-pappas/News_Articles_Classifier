On the play following Zonfrelli’s pick, star running back Josh Pierre-Charles broke loose for a 40-yard touchdown to give Millis/Hopedale a 6-0 lead.\nPatterson shook off his early struggles and began to heat up in the second quarter. The 6-foot-4, 225-pound senior completed 10-of-13 passes on a 19-play, 69-yard drive and after a pass interference call at the goal line against Millis, Patterson connected with Danny Cooke for a one yard score, tying the game at 6 with three seconds left in the half.\n“Late in the half, we were just trying to keep everything in front of us and tackle it but we had a 15-yard penalty on third down on the drive, which was uncharacteristic of us,” said Millis coach Dana Olson. “It kept the drive alive and we didn’t want to give them a big play. They kind of nickled and dimed us down the field and we’ve had a problem this year giving up touchdowns on fourth down.”\nIn the third, Patterson hooked up with wideout Kevin Hession on a corner route for a 21-yard touchdown, then struck again with a 17-yard scoring pass to Jimmy Fallon to start the fourth.\nDefensively, the Wolverines were strong all night. They held Pierre-Charles to just 62 yards on nine carries and kept the Mohawks pretty much in check for the final three quarters.\n“We tried to mix up our looks a little bit,” Mantie said. “You can’t just give them one look because they’ll make the adjustments and starting getting (Pierre-Charles) out to the edge. Our linebackers played great, they kept great leverage on the kid. He’s one of those kids that if you overrun him, he’s going to cut back underneath you. Our safeties tackled very well and I thought we played pretty stout up front.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:41:01.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
