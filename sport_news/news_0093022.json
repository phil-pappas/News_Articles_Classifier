Steeleville made a push to take the opening set from Du Quoin on Thursday night, but the Lady Indians bounced back strong in the second and third to control the majority of both sets and go on to win 23-25, 25-19, 25-16 on Senior Night. Du Quoin led most of the first set and had a 20-18 advantage before Steeleville grabbed a lead at 22-21. The Lady Indians moved back in front at 23-22, but the Lady Warriors took three straight points to close out the set. DHS jumped ahead 7-1 in the second set before Steeleville tied things up at 8-8, but from that point on the Lady Indians took control of the match. Du Quoin took six of seven points later in the set to lead 24-16, then scored eight straight in the third to build a 15-6 edge on their way to the win. \"We gave up a run early, but after that I think we settled down and settled in,\" said Du Quoin head coach Jo Dill. \"I think we're finally starting to click on all cylinders. We've found something that's working, our block has allowed us to play good defense because our block takes away a lot. That's why we've had so many digs, and then that allows us to run our offense.\" \"Credit Steeleville's hitters, those girls were swinging throughout the whole match. They were playing it smart, making us work for it. I was really impressed that our girls kept pushing instead of waiting for the other team to give us the game.\" Jordyn Bullar led Du Quoin with 11 kills, Kenzie Jackson added 8. Jackson led digs with 13, Alaina Caldwell had 10, Bullar 9, and Gates and Rylea McDonald each finished with 8. Caldwell also racked up 26 assists. \"I'm happy with where we are heading into Regionals,\" Dill said. \"We're going to come out and prepare Friday and Saturday and be ready for Sesser on Monday.\" The Lady Indians (6-21) will meet Sesser-Valier in the first round of Regionals on Monday at 6 p.m. in Johnston City. The winner gets Carmi-White County in the semifinals on Tuesday.
