Knowing fully well, that if she looked at any of the judges, she wouldn’t be able to deliver the given dialogue, just like as the story goes, she fixed her stare at the blank wall behind them ala Arjuna and delivered! Chandigarh girl, Mehzaz, made to the finale and two years on, is happy to announce the second season of the Zee show. “The show has given me a lot,” the ten-year-old opens matter of factly, “My heart would go dhak dhak dhak as I would go on stage to recite a poem, not any more. I have also learnt nuances and technicalities on how best to face the camera.” As one marvels over her supreme poise, she merrily chirps that it is actually Dhak Dhak girl Madhuri Dixit who is her idol. “Not only is she a fabulous actor but also a dancer, I too want to be a complete package like her.” Though the shifts that she had to pull were long in the three months stint at IBD, this class sixth student shares that she enjoyed it all. “We would leave at six for the shoot and rarely come back early. On finale night, we came back at six,” says he girl who had her mother (a theatre actor) and dad (an entrepreneur) to keep her company in Mumbai. “But we would laugh and play the whole day around.” “They had a manager on sets, to monitor that each kid was eating and resting well,” puts in her father Hardev Mann. Winning the Team of the Week and Act of the Week title for her team Dhamaka was what Mehnaz remembers as her best moment. “One would get a tubful of chocolates and we would scoop down loads,” she giggles. Post IBD, Mehnaz has acted in series Ek Mutthi Aasmaan but she is now taking it slow and steady. “She received lots of offers post IBD, but she is only keen on lead roles that interest her,” her father adds, making us marvel at her once again. A student of St Xavier’s, Panchkula, Mehnaz is quick to cover up the studies she misses on her shooting schedules, “Papa teaches me maths and science, whenever we get time on the sets, and I keep in touch with my school friends.” In fact, the show earned her more friends like Zenith and Anjali with whom she keeps in touch. Post the show while she remains as popular as she was before, “teachers who didn’t know me acknowledge me now.” ‘Be easy’ is what this actress in making advises for contestant aiming at India’s Best Dramebaaz 2 audition that will happen on Tuesday October 13, 9 am onwards at The British School, Sec- 44 B. mona@tribunemail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:20:32.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
