The team says he had a meniscal tear repaired.\nThe loss of Keith, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy last season for playoff MVP, is a huge blow for the Stanley Cup champions. They play in one of the NHL's toughest divisions, and every point could make a difference at the end of the year.\nKeith is likely headed for long-term injured reserve, giving the Blackhawks some cap relief. Lubomir Visnovsky, a veteran defenseman who was with the team during training camp, could be brought back, or they could promote someone from the minors.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/jsonline.com/MAI/334689191/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:50:26.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
