Kyle Gibbs said. Police didn’t immediately release any details about the four killed in the crash, which happened around 10:30 a.m. ET. The Oklahoma University Medical Center said one of the victims was a 2-year-old who died at the hospital early Saturday evening. \n\"Our hearts are so heavy today,\" Stillwater Mayor Gina Noble told USA TODAY. \nThis photo released by Stillwater, Okla. police shows Adacia Avery Chambers, 25, who they have arrested on suspicion of drunk driving after she crashed her car into the Oklahoma State homecoming parade on Saturday morning. (Photo: Stillwater Police Department) \nThe homecoming game against Kansas was played as scheduled, players bowing their heads in prayer as the American flag fluttered at half staff in Boone Pickens Stadium under orders from Gov. Mary Fallin, an Oklahoma State alumnus who attended the homecoming game. The university's homecoming is a major celebration, drawing more than 80,000 alumni, fans and area residents downtown. A pep rally before the game was cancelled, said Noble, who was the parade's grand marshal. \n“Our hearts and prayers go out with those who lost loved ones today, to those that were injured in the tragedy,” Fallin said during a halftime press conference. \nNoting other tragic occurrences, both in the state of Oklahoma and with the Oklahoma State University community — including two plane crashes in 2001 and 2011, involving the men’s and women’s basketball programs, respectively — Fallin added: “One thing I do know about Oklahoma people. They’re strong. They’re very compassionate. They believe in prayer. They believe in comforting people and helping during a time of crisis and need. We’ll get through this again. But certainly it’s a very painful experience for those of us here, and certainly for all Oklahomans.\" \nParamedics and firefighters participating in the parade were able to assist the injured immediately, authorities said. \n“Tragically we lost three. I hope we don’t lose any more,” the university's president, Burns Hargis, said in an afternoon press conference. “The Cowboy family pulls together. Unfortunately, we’ve had to do it before, and we're going do it again.” \nPHOTOS: OKLAHOMA STATE PARADE CRASH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:16:53.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
