It was a strong first half and maybe we should have seen the game out, finished a few more chances, but it wasn't to be,\" he said.\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was happy with the team's performance and said they deserved to win.\n\"The feeling is that we lost two points. I'm disappointed but at the same time, I'm happy with the performance and the effort, that was brilliant,\" Pochettino said.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:54:59.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
