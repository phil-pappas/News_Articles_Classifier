The Grizzlies won, 42-16. \nMISSOULA — Only three players in Montana history had ever passed for six touchdowns in one game before Saturday's Grizzly blowout of North Dakota. \nThose three combined for 262 TDs across three illustrious careers. The fourth, who joined the club in the recent 42-16 win, has now thrown for seven. \nMakena Simis, two weeks ago a backup and two months ago buried at third-string, can be now forever mentioned alongside all-time greats Dave Dickenson, Brian Ah Yat and Jordan Johnson. \n\"I didn’t even know that until about five minutes ago,\" Simis said of his record-tying performance, complete with wide grin. \"That's pretty cool and I found out it was JJ's too. We're pretty good buddies, so that'll be cool to talk to him.\" \nSimis backed up Johnson as a freshman last season, though never threw a pass, and was again hidden on the depth chart to start this season with the emergence of Brady Gustafson. Injuries forced Simis into action, making Saturday his first career start. \nAnd what a first it was. \nDickenson — the program's career leader in, among other things, touchdown passes (96) — first tied the school single-game record at five (Brad Lebo, 1991) and then broke it, all in 1995. Dickenson's six-pack came against Boise State, a game in which he threw for 383 yards on 26-of-38 passing. \nAh Yat was the next to the party three years later, airing it out against Stephen F. Austin in the 1998 season opener. His six were accompanied by 458 yards, a 30-for-47 day, in UM's 49-42 comeback victory. His was the only such performance accompanied by an interception, two in fact. \nJohnson made it a crowd of three in 2011, throwing six TDs against Weber State. Johnson, last year's starter, threw for 299 yards in that game and accomplished the feat on just 23 completions (in 32 attempts). \nUntil Simis. The redshirt sophomore — Dickenson and Ah Yat were seniors in their record-setting games; Johnson was a sophomore as well — was 16 for 23 and also threw for 323 yards. Quarterback carousel \nWith Simis performing at a legendary level, what happens in the Grizzly backfield once season-opening starter Brady Gustafson returns? \nThat, coach Bob Stitt said, is a discussion for another day. \n\"We just take it week by week,\" the coach said. \"I'm so proud of Makena and I don't want to talk about that kind of stuff because he just had the best day a quarterback's ever had at this school. We're gonna enjoy this thing.\" \nGustafson, who broke his fibula a month ago on the Grizzlies' road trip to Liberty, was on the field in street clothes during the North Dakota game without the aid of crutches or a supportive boot. Stitt has said he expects the QB to be healthy soon, though hasn't specified when exactly that might be. \nA break to the fibula, the less weight-supporting bone in the lower leg, can heal in four to six weeks. \nFellow backup Chad Chalich, who suffered a fractured foot against Weber State two weeks ago, will miss considerably more time. \nWhat appears to be known after Saturday's game is which QB is No. 4 on Montana's depth chart. And he's listed as a receiver. \nSenior Tyler Lucas handled Montana's final drive of the game. He was 1-for-1 passing for five yards and also ran twice for 27 yards, including a 22-yard scamper that saw him hurdle a defender into the red zone. \nLucas had not appeared in a game yet this season after sitting out last year following a transfer to Penn State from De Anza Community College, where he played both QB and WR. \n\"Tyler’s a guy we gave reps all week and he played quarterback for three years,\" Stitt said of playing Lucas instead of supposed backup Eric Prater. \"We thought if a helmet comes off and somebody’s got to go in, Tyler Lucas is a guy that can do it\" Ballhawkers \nMontana forced two turnovers — a fumble and an interception – without giving one up on Saturday, something that brought a smile to defensive coordinator Ty Gregorak’s face. \nThe Griz were languishing in the middle of the pack in the Big Sky in turnover margin, having given up the ball 12 times against nine turnovers forced coming into to Saturday’s game. That’s unusual for Gregorak’s defense, which has led the league in that category the past two seasons and three of the last four. \nJeremiah Kose picked off an underthrown pass by UND quarterback Ryan Bartels in the third quarter, while Tyrone Holmes forced a fumble by Bartels on a sack in the fourth quarter. UND had three other fumbles that it was able to pounce on. \n“We finally got back into the plus side of turnovers, that’s huge,” Gregorak said. “We were ballhawkers again. We’d been in a little drought there. That’s where in past years we’ve been so good at getting the football back. The last few games we’ve been very poor. We could have had a couple more.” \nUM had none two weeks ago in its loss to Weber State and just one total in its three defeats.
