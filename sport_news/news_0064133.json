(Photo: George Walker IV / The Tennessean) Buy Photo \nTitans quarterback Marcus Mariota will not play in Sunday’s game against the Falcons at Nissan Stadium after the rookie sat out his third consecutive practice Friday with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee. \n“We’re going to list him as out for this game, a combination of just missing practice and not quite being there,” Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said. “He’s close, but it’s a combination of those two things. We decided that was the best way to go this week.” \nBackup quarterback Zach Mettenberger will start. Mettenberger, a sixth-round draft pick in 2014, started six of the seven games he played in last season, all of them Titans losses. He completed 59.8 percent of his passes for 1,412 yards, eight touchdowns, seven interceptions and an 84.4 passer rating. \n“Any playing time is extremely valuable in this league,” Mettenberger said. “I’m going to take what I learned last year and everything I learned this offseason and up to this point and try to put together a clean game.” \nMariota was injured on a low, late hit by Dolphins defensive end Olivier Vernon in the second quarter of a 38-10 loss Sunday in Nashville. \nMariota, the second overall pick in this year’s draft, remained in the game and committed four turnovers before being replaced by Mettenberger for the team’s final possession. Mettenberger completed 5 of 8 passes for 63 yards. \nThe NFL fined Vernon $37,363 for two roughing the passer penalties against Mariota. He’s docked $17,363 for the low hit and $20,000 for a hit to the head. His appeal was denied by the league. \nMariota has said he didn’t think the hit was “malicious at all” and that Vernon apologized to him after the game. \n“Marcus is one of the best guys ever. He’s really a class act,” Mettenberger said. “He said he’s behind me 100 percent, and whatever I need he’s going to help me out with. I think he knows that’s what I do for him every week, and that’s the kind of relationship we have. We’re both team guys and we want to get some wins and we understand that whoever is back there is the guy that’s going to give us the best opportunity to do that under any circumstance. Hopefully we can work together on Sunday. Hopefully he can tell me something he sees and we can get a touchdown off it.” \nWhisenhunt said the state of the Titans’ offensive line had no bearing on his decision to sit Mariota. Tennessee has allowed 20 sacks this season, fourth-most in the NFL, despite playing one fewer game than most teams because of the early bye week. \nMariota was sacked five times on Sunday against the Dolphins. Mettenberger was sacked once. During the game, the Titans lost starting center Brian Schwenke for the season because of a dislocated left ankle and benched rookie right tackle Jeremiah Poutasi, who is expected to remain the starter. \nRookie center Andy Gallik will start Sunday against the Falcons. \nIt’s unclear exactly how much this week of rest has helped Mariota and whether he’ll be able to return for the Titans’ following game on Nov. 1 at Houston. \n“He’s frustrated because he wants to play,” Whisenhunt said. “I don’t know. He’s getting better. I don’t know what difference it makes. We want to get him back on the field as soon as possible. It just won’t be this week.” \nThe Titans (1-4) have lost four games in a row and eight consecutive at home. \n“I think we’ve been putting our best effort out there every week,” Mettenberger said. “We’ve just been shooting ourselves in the foot. If we can just clean up the mistakes, play smart, penalty-free football, keep the chains moving and really take advantage of any opportunities that come and make plays – really, I just named everything you have to do to win a football game offensively. But we’ve got to string together a good, clean football game to try to get the win.” \nCornerback Perrish Cox (hamstring) and wide receiver Harry Douglas (ribs) will also miss Sunday’s game, leaving the Titans short-handed in the secondary against Julio Jones, Matt Ryan and one of the NFL’s top offenses, and leaving Mettenberger with only three wide receivers. \nThe Titans could rely more heavily on their stable of five tight ends or promote receivers Tre McBride or Rico Richardson from the practice squad. \nWhisenhunt didn’t rule out a roster move before Sunday’s game. \n“We’ve gotten some of these young guys reps during the week, so we’re prepared to go either direction,” he said. \nReach Jason Wolf at jwolf@tennessean.com and follow him on Twitter at @JasonWolf and on Instagram at TitansBeat.
