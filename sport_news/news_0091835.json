St. John’s coach Chris Mullin strolled into Carnesecca Arena in a red golf shirt, khaki pants and sandals with neon-yellow soles Wednesday. He brought California cool back with him from the Bay Area and readied to slip on sneakers for practice.\n“I want my players to be comfortable and confident,” he said.\nNow in his first season as head coach at his alma mater, Mullin wore a whistle and watched his charges run through fundamental drills, closing out on defense and working the angles as passers on offense. He maintained that his plan was to guide his unit into competition between game days. He also continued to condition them for an offense that he wants moving at a fast pace with an emphasis on the NBA style. He called upon them to work selflessly through their transition.\n“I love practice,” he said. “I think we need it.”\nTests are coming soon. Mullin’s first regular-season game as a college basketball coach will be Nov. 13 against Wagner at Carnesecca Arena. His Madison Square Garden debut will be on Dec. 6 against St. Francis-Brooklyn in the Holiday Festival. In between, there are 10 newcomers and three returnees on the roster.\nThere are two freshmen contending for time at point guard. They are Federico Mussini from Italy and Marcus LoVett from Illinois.\n“They have experience beyond their years,” Mullin said.\nMullin’s full staff was on hand. Hall of Fame guard Mitch Richmond emerged in public for the first time since being hired. Both Mullin and Richmond are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n“I’m not quiet sure what Elias would say about that, but I think that’s the first time in college that there’s two Hall of Fame players (on the same staff),” Mullin said. “We’re going to do it together. My staff has pretty much guided me. This is a whole new ball game, not just coaching. We’ll do it as a team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:49:24.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
