I’m what the experts call a “laggard” when it comes to technological advances.\nIn my social circle I was the last of my friends to get a home computer. I was the last person to get a laptop. It took me seven years to get wifi at my house. I was late to jump on the smartphone bandwagon. I still don’t have Netflix, Hulu, Spotify or any of the fancy entertainment outlets that seem to have deep penetration in our current culture.\nHaving said all that, when it comes to driverless cars, I am prepared to be an early adapter. That is one technology I plan to be on the forefront of.\nEric Risberg FILE - In this Tuesday, May 13, 2014 file photo, a screen shows what a Google self-driving car sees through the window of one of the cars on exhibit at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. California's Department of Motor Vehicles will miss a year-end deadline to adopt new rules for cars of the future because regulators first have to figure out how they'll know whether \"driverless\" vehicles are safe. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg,File) We aren’t that far away from from driverless cars from not only being a reality, but also being the norm. I know many of you reading this are thinking “I love to drive, there is no way I’ll ever get a driverless car.” Trust me, you will.\nHow many staples of life in the past had similar supporters in the face of innovation.\nIn the transportation industry alone, how many people at the turn of the 20th century said I will never get on a horseless carriage, how many said I will never get in an airplane? How many of you reading this now vowed to never use seat belts in a car, or to have a car with air conditioning, power windows or automatic transmission?\nJeff Chiu In this Monday, Aug. 24, 2015 photo, Brian Torcellini, Google team leader of driving operations, right, poses for photos with vehicle safety specialists Rob Miller, top left, and Ryan Espinosa, next to a vehicle at a Google office in Mountain View, Calif. Google employs a few dozen \"safety drivers” that grab the steering wheel or hit the brakes on a fleet of robot cars that Google’s engineers are programming to navigate the roads without human assistance. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Technology always wins my friends, it always wins.\nListen, I like driving as much as you do. The open road, the freedom of going anywhere you want to go, the ability to just get away. I understand all that. The benefits of the driverless car will make you forget it.\nI imagine years ago people scoffed at dishwashers and automatic washers and dryers. “I enjoy going to the creek to do my laundry” was probably an often heard phrase. Some day in the future we are going to look back at cars that had to be actually driven by humans with the same scepticism. People actually used to have to drive themselves around?\nEric Risberg FILE - This file photo taken Tuesday, May 13, 2014 shows a row of Google self-driving cars outside the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. California's Department of Motor Vehicles will miss a year-end deadline to adopt new rules for cars of the future because regulators first have to figure out how they'll know whether \"driverless\" vehicles are safe. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg,File) Think about the benefits of the driverless car. First, less stress. Driving, while at times an enjoyable experience, quite often is very stressful. When the car drives itself, your stress will evaporate.\nSecond, think of all the things you can do while the car is driving itself! Eat, text, email, put on makeup, sleep, talk on the phone. All things that are either illegal or dangerous or both when you have to drive yourself.\nPerhaps the biggest benefit and the one that will cost me my job? A lot less traffic.\nWhen cars drive themselves, they will also talk to each other. With the computers working in sync with each other, the computers will figure out how get around causing the least traffic delays. I’ll say it again. Driverless cars will mean a virtual traffic free existence.\nThat will most likely put me out of a job, but you can bet that I’ll be in my driverless car headed to the unemployment office.\nGridlock updatesMark Arum’s column appears Mondays.
