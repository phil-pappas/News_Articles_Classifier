Oman won the match 3-0 (Ahmed al Saidi/Muscat Daily) By Ashok Purohit October 14, 2015 \nIt was a tale of two contrasting halves. The first, when India managed to thwart a wave of attacks from the Omani strikers to go into the break goalless. The second, when the hosts finally managed to break the stalemate ten minutes after the break. \nAfter that breakthrough, Oman took total control of the proceedings, pumping in two more goals to win with an emphatic 3-0 scoreline and leapfrog Iran to reach the top of Group D in the joint qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the 2019 Asian Cup at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex (SQSC) on Tuesday. \nOman's Abdulaziz al Miqbali celebrates after scoring against India during the joint qualifier for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the 2019 Asian Cup at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex on Tuesday \nAhmed Mubarak ‘Kanu’ broke the stalemate in the 55th minute, applying finishing touches to a diving header from substitute Abdulaziz al Miqbali, and then, it was the turn of Miqbali to blast home two goals, in the 66th and 83rd minutes, to seal a convincing win. \nThe Red Warriors, coached by Paul Le Guen, were high on confidence after their 1-1 draw against Asia's top-ranked side Iran last Thursday at the same venue and walked into the arena as the clear favourites. \nOman’s Imad al Hosni (left) and India’s Sandesh Jhingan vie for the ball \nTalks of a big scoreline were widely predicted, which Frenchman Le Guen had summarily dismissed to make sure his players didn't take the lesser-fancied Indians for granted. \nAnd when the marauding Omani strikers, ably assisted by an attacking midfield, repeatedly failed to break India's surprisingly stubborn defence, a lot of credit had to go to India's goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu for keeping the slate clean for nearly an hour. Although the first half didn't provide any breakthrough, Oman did dominate its rival. \nBut India, coached by Stephen Constantine, held on bravely as the Omanis either fumbled with their finishing inside the box or found Sandhu stonewalling effectively. For the larger part of the opening half, the hosts played in India's half, except for a 44th-minute attempt by India striker Sunil Chhetri that went over the bar. \nOman had the first attempt of the match 20 minutes into the action through an Imad al Hosni effort, who had scored in the 2-1 away win against India in Bengaluru in June. \nSoon, Raeed Ibrahim, who was pushed forward from his usual midfield role, had a go at the goal, only to find the ball hit the woodwork. Oman's grip on the game could be gauged from the fact that in a span of half an hour, it earned as many as five corner-kicks. \nDefender Abdulsalam Amour was in the thick of the action at the half-hour mark when his header went just wide. \nEid al Farsi went close to scoring in the 38th minute when he was left unmarked by the Indian defenders and it needed a brilliant save from Sandhu to keep the hosts at bay. \nPrior to that save, Sandhu had already been forced into action a couple of times, and each time, he managed to stave off danger. \nWith Oman, ranked 102nd in the world, struggling to find a goal against a rival ranked way below at No 167, frustration grew among the Oman fans in the 11,000-strong crowd that also comprised a sizeable number of India supporters. \nThe Red Warriors appeared a little over-eager at times in their desperate bid to open the scoring, while the visitors defended stoutly. The hard-working Sandesh Jhingan, in particular, stood out in India's backline. \nIn a bid to translate the domination into goals, Le Guen decided to bring in Miqbali at the start of the second half in place of Hosni and the switch turned out to be a masterstroke. \nMiqbali's speedy runs began to pose problems for the Indian defenders, who were clearly running out of gas after a tiring first session. \nThe Indians arrived in Muscat for the game following a 40-hour delay and having had just two practice sessions to shape up for Tuesday's clash, the players were fighting their own fitness battle apart from having to keep a dogged Omani frontline at bay. \nTen minutes into the second half, some sloppy defending allowed Miqbali to head to the far corner of the goal, where an opportunistic Kanu got hold of the ball and tapped it home to make it 1-0. The breakthrough came five minutes after a smart one-two between Qasim Said and Miqbali almost resulted in a goal, only for an ever alert Sandhu to end the challenge. \nQasim Said, with his runs down the flanks, was instrumental in creating the next goal. He produced a defence-splitting pass that saw Miqbali slam in his first goal, and Oman's second of the night. \nFarsi had a golden chance a few minutes later, but fluffed it. However, Miqbali wasn't done yet, unleashing a superb header off a cross from substitute Mohsin Jowhar that beat Sandhu seven minutes from the final whistle.
