(AP Photo/Jim Mone) \nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Lynx missed eight free throws, turned the ball over 15 times and were outscored by the Indiana Fever 22-12 on second-chance points to drop Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. \nHad they gotten production even close to what they’re used to getting from stars Lindsay Whalen and Seimone Augustus, they still might have been able to pull off the victory. \nWhalen and Augustus combined for 13 points on 4 for 14 shooting in the loss on their home court. \nCoach Cheryl Reeve was blunt after the game in assessing the poor play from the two veterans. On Monday, Reeve pivoted to defend Whalen, saying she is not getting the calls she should be getting from the officials. \nGame 2 of the best-of-five series is Tuesday night in Minneapolis.
