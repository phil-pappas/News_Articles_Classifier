First-year superintendent Brian Maher is running unopposed for the spot. \nSouth Dakota's largest school district will soon have a voice on the board of directors of the South Dakota High School Activities Association. Some say it's been too long and it almost didn't happen this time around. \n\"I know how serious the position is. I know how time consuming the position is done correctly. So my first thought was, 'I can't do it right now,'\" Maher said. \nSwamped in his first few months as Sioux Falls superintendent, Maher says he has plenty on his plate already. After talking with his school board though, he quickly learned how desperate the district is to have a representative. \n\"Of course I was like, 'Wait a minute, here's our opportunity.' So we're excited as a school board for him to have a seat at the table,\" School Board member Todd Thoelke said. \nThoelke ran twice for an activities association spot and says he came in last each time. He thinks Maher is the right man for the job at the right time. \n\"His intention is to do what's best for the students, the state. I truly believe his fresh perspective, his outlook and his past experience is going to give us exactly that,\" Thoelke said. \nComing from a small district in Nebraska, Maher says Omaha and Lincoln had similar difficulties getting on the board in that state. With a lot of debate about where state tournaments should be played in South Dakota, he realizes smaller communities in this state will keep a close eye on what he has to say. \n\"I know a lot of folks in Sioux Falls will get in my ear. I don't doubt that and I think that's part of representing Sioux Falls. I also know the activities association is a statewide association,\" Maher said. \nAnd with a passion for activities and what they can do to keep students engaged, he can't wait to be a part of the association's future. \n\"I'm a piece to that puzzle. I'm not the puzzle itself,\" Maher said. \nA formal announcement about Maher's new role will be made next week. He is running unopposed because the Rapid City superintendent is resigning at the end of the school year. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
