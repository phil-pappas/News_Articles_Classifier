Last season, the former Colorado State star was a wide-eyed, happy-go-lucky practice squad player coming to work everyday eager to keep his dream alive of playing in the NFL. \nOn Sunday, Barrett will make his first NFL start in place of the injured DeMarcus Ware. \n\"It's part of the plan, but I didn't envision it like that. I thought I'd be able to be a real good special teams player this year and be able to contribute that way,\" Barrett said. \"Defensively, I didn't think I would be able to get as many snaps as I've been getting. I've been getting them, trying to run with them and take advantage of my opportunity.\" \nHe saw a sliver of opportunity hidden behind a deep and talented roster. The odds were against Barrett to even make the team behind All-Pro pass rushers DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller, along with first-round draft pick Shane Ray. He didn't have much on film to show new coach Gary Kubiak, but he found a way to make an impression during off-season workouts, and then training camp. \n\"As a player, a lot of guys would go in the tank and say, 'Boy, when is my opportunity going to be,' but all he did was come out here and practice hard, work hard and every time that he gets out there, he makes a play,\" Kubiak said. \nHe's made enough plays that Kubiak didn't hesitate in naming him the starter for Sunday, even over Ray, who has sacks in back-to-back games.

But on Sunday, once it happens, I'll be pretty excited.\" \nBarrett has been a special teams standout all season, and was the unit's captain in Oakland last Sunday. And he's gotten enough snaps on defense that he won't have butterflies when he's out there on play number one. \n\"This is probably the best situation for Shaq,\" Miller said. \"For the first five games, he didn't start, but he had a lot of playing time and now he's (able) to come in and start. He's more than ready to go. You should see a lot of great stuff from him this weekend.\" \nHe has 13 tackles, two sacks and two forced fumbles this season. Last week Barrett had the best game of his young career with seven tackles, a forced fumble and a second-half sack of Raiders' quarterback Derek Carr. \nThe most important number, however, was 38. That's how many snaps he played on defense, a statement about the trust the coaches put in him.

September 03, 2014 ( Joe Amon, The Denver Post ) \n\"He's a great example of if you do it, you won't come out,\" Kubiak said. \"He had a good offseason, a good training camp and all of a sudden when it came to game time, he just kept making plays. He's earned the right to be out there, play more and contribute.\" \nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe \nWho is Shaquil Barrett? \n— 6-foot-2, 242 pound outside linebacker \n— Spent his freshman year in college at Nebraska-Omaha before transferring to Colorado State for the last three years after UNO's football program was cut. \n— Finished his CSU career with 246 tackles, 18 sacks, seven forced fumbles and three interceptions.
