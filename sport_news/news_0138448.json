Voss didn't stop driving until he pulled into the driveway of his home on Southeast Steele Street, according to a probable cause affidavit.\nOfficers searched his vehicle and found eight bags of methamphetamine inside and $435 in cash on him, deputy district attorney David Hannon wrote in the affidavit. Officers also seized a firearm, heroin and a digital scale found inside a safe in his residence, the affidavit said.\nVoss admitted to officers that he deals methamphetamine and didn't pull over right away for police because he didn't want his vehicle to be towed. Police discovered he was driving with a suspended license, the affidavit said.\nVoss faces pending charges in Jackson County - felon in possession of a firearm and driving while suspended - from an Aug. 24 arrest. A Jackson County sheriff's deputy stopped Voss about 4:50 a.m. that day for speeding on Highway 97. Police determined he was driving without a license and had a rifle case in the car that contained an AR-15 rifle, and a 60-round magazine full of ammunition, according to court records.\nTwo days later, Voss was released from custody in Jackson County, with the conditions that he not possess any firearms and not drive without a license or insurance, as he awaited his next court date, according to court records.\nVoss now is being held at the Multnomah County's Inverness Jail. His next court date is Nov. 10.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-09-30T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:33:29.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
