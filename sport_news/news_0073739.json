They had some nice (blocks) that sprung some big plays,” Morris said. “I think (the) kids are closer to each other, they’re bought in, blocking with each other, celebrating with each other when they do.” \nThis season, Morris introduced a new accolade for the receivers that get down the field and block, and that is a World Wrestling Entertainment-styled championship belt. \nThe winner of the belt has yet to be chosen for Saturday’s win, but will be given out after practice this week. \nPrevious winners include sophomore receiver Ian Sadler, who did not play against the Cyclones. \nFreshman receiver Tony Brown could be taking the belt after practice, Morris said, because of his two blocks on a 75-yard pass from sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes II to Grant. \nBrown was making his first start as a Red Raider, and Tech coach   Brown played as well as he could have expected. \n“I mean, subbing as a true freshman, first start, I thought he handled himself well on the big touchdown pass,” Kingsbury said, “had two awesome blocks for Jakeem to kind of spring him there, made some big catches.” \nAnother possibility could be sophomore receiver Ja’Deion High, who Morris said was the best blocking wide receiver during the game. \n“I thought Ja’Deion High was probably the best blocking receiver we had,” Morris said. “He didn’t crush anybody, but his guy didn’t make the play one time, and DeAndre’s (Washington) long run, he blocked the guy 10 seconds down the field.” \nAccording to ESPN, the Tech offense has a total of a 93.6 offensive efficiency, which is the point contribution of each unit on a team’s scoring margin. \nThat stat is currently second in the nation behind fellow Big 12 Conference member Baylor. \nTech’s offense has been driven on making explosive plays all year and Morris gave credit to each individual player for being willing to help each of their teammates by doing a little more each play. \n“… To me, it’s if a kid wants to do it, he’s going to get out there and do it, if he wants to do it for his teammates and block for each other,” Morris said. “That’s why football is the greatest team sport in America, it’s because these kids actually sacrifice their bodies for each other every single play.” \nTech is looking to even its record in conference play to 2-2 when the team travels to Lawrence, Kansas, to take on the Kansas Jayhawks at 11 a.m. Saturday at the University of Kansas Memorial Stadium. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:23:36.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
