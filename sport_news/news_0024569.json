Marie Evening News - Sault Ste. Marie, MI By LSSU reports Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 9:26 PM By LSSU reports Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 9:26 PM PORTLAND, Maine â€” Lake Superior State dropped its second game to start the season, falling to Michigan State 4-1 Saturday in the final game for either team at the 19th annual Ice Breaker Tournament. The Lakers open the season 0-2 for the second-straight season after starting last year with a pair of home losses against WCHA rival Michigan Tech. The Lakers (0-2) had trouble finding the back of the net due to the spectacular play of Jake Hildebrand. Hildebrand produced 30 saves while leading the Spartans to the decisive victory and picking up his first win of the season. The Spartans (1-0-1) opened the scoring 14:23 into the first period on the stick of Michael Ferrantino. Ferrantino's first goal of the season was assisted by freshman Zach Osburn, who scored a pair of goals against Maine on Friday in his first collegiate game, and junior J.T. Stenglein. The Lakers answered shortly before the end of the opening period with Gage Torrel's first career goal as a Laker. Torrel (1-0--1) received a centering pass from Gus Correale (0-1--1) and fired it past the sprawling Hildebrand. The goal by Torrel was all the Lakers could muster on Hildebrand, who proved why he is regarded as one of the top goaltenders in college hockey. The teams went to the initial intermission knotted up at one goal apiece. Following the first period, the Spartans led in the shots column 11-5. MSU found the back of the net again in the second period to take a 2-1 lead with 8:06 remaining in the middle frame. The goal by Mackenzie MacEachern, his first of the season, was the only power-play goal for either team in a game marred by penalties. The Spartans went 1-for-7 on the power play and the Lakers were blanked in their four attempts with the extra attacker. The Lakers outshot the Spartans 15-12 in the second period, despite allowing the only goal of the period. The Spartans added some insurance 13 seconds into the final period with a goal by John Draeger. Draeger's first goal of the season helped secure the Spartans' victory that Hildebrand eventual cemented with his confident play in net. Defiel played the entirety of the game for the Lakers once again and made 27 saves on the evening. Defiel has now given up four goals in back-to-back starts. North Dakota 5, Lakers 2: The Lakers fell to highly-touted North Dakota 5-2 in the first game of the 19th annual Ice Breaker Tournament in Portland, Maine. The Lakers jumped out to a 2-0 lead before North Dakota collected five unanswered goals, including an empty-netter, en route to the non-conference victory. The Lakers looked to open the scoring just 13 seconds into the game following a redirection from junior Gus Correale. Following a review, it was deemed that Correale had illegally directed the puck into the net with his skate. Page 2 of 2 - J.T. Henke, a sophomore who began his collegiate career with tournament host Maine in 2013-14, opened the scoring with his first tally as a member of the Lakers. Freshman Jake Hand and sophomore Matt Johnson added the assists on the opening goal. The Lakers captured an early 2-0 lead, just 5:47 into the first period. Mitch Hults, another newcomer for the Lakers, put a power-play goal past starting goaltender Cam Johnson to collect his first collegiate goal. Once again it was Hand chipping in on the assist. Henke also tallied his second point on the night with the helper on Hults' goal. The Lakers took a 2-0 lead into the dressing room despite being down in the shot column 17-5.
