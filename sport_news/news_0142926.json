MSU is now 10-6, 2-3 in Big Ten play, while Nebraska is 13-2, 4-1 in conference action. \n\"We knew that we had our challenges with their lineup, and they were just more consistent tonight,\" MSU coach Cathy George said. \"We won't use injuries as an excuse. Its a matter of getting re-focused to bring a strong performance to Iowa and try to close out this week on a better note .\" \nThe Spartans play at Iowa Saturday night, before returning to East Lansing for a four-game home stand against Maryland, Rutgers, Ohio State and Penn State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:12:41.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
