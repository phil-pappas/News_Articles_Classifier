Suffering a broken face is hardly a routine basketball setback. Yet Conley played in the Western Conference semifinals against the NBA champion Golden State Warriors just days after surgery to repair several facial fractures due to a freak collision in the first round.\nThe Grizzlies' version of Iron Man is back, completely healthy and in one piece. He's stronger, having returned with a more chiseled frame by virtue of at least 15 pounds of added muscle. And he's preparing to play a bigger role offensively for the Grizzlies.\nConley also appears more focused on not allowing his contract year become a distraction and blocking out the continued ballyhoo he's received over his performances with a broken face.\n\"It put everything to the forefront for everybody who didn't know who I was and what I was about. They learned I was tough,\" Conley said, referring to observers of his game outside of Memphis. \"I hate it had to take my face to be broken for people to recognize me. People are saying what a great player I am, but I've been good. ... I'm looking forward to another good year. My thoughts are completely on this season and on the team. We have unfinished business.\"\nWith Conley prepared to enhance an already burgeoning reputation of being durable and reliable, Griz coach Dave Joerger will use training camp to put more responsibility on his point guard's suddenly broader shoulders.\nJoerger wants Conley in the lane more without deferring and looking to score at the rim.\n\"We need more quick attacks from him and get us some easy baskets by being aggressive,\" Joerger said. \"He's gotten better at it, and our guys have gotten to a place where they realize he can make the game easier for guys. Some of the ball movement we're doing right now is making it easier. But his quick attacks are paramount to our success. He gets stronger every year, and what I like is he's really strengthened his legs.\"\nDoctors declared that Conley's facial fractures were mostly healed soon after the Griz were eliminated by the Warriors. One fracture needed more time, and that one healed by the end of July.\nConley then intensified his off-season regime. He worked out four or five days a week. The workouts included weight training and yoga afterward to enhance his core and stability. Conley often ran in the pool for conditioning without stress.\nThe weight gain came with Conley eating large portions of carbohydrates — pasta and meat.\n\"I had a talk with management and the coaches and the training staff. They all said the same thing. They wanted my lower body to be stronger to withstand any injuries,\" Conley said. \"It's all looking good so far. I'm going to try to stay on that regimen and stay strong.\"\nCenter Marc Gasol, Conley's best friend on the team, has double-dared him to stay committed.\n\"I always tell him you've got to keep it up. It's one thing to come back big but throughout the season you have to keep it up,\" said Gasol, who has received rave reviews for transforming his body. \"We have our own thing now between me and him. We'll see how it goes.\"\nTeammate Tony Allen doesn't doubt that Conley will at least continue a push toward being regarded as one of the league's elites at his position.\n\"Any point guard that comes to face him, I'm pretty sure they're reading their scouting report and they're getting their rest before the game because Mike Conley is a force to be reckoned with,\" Allen said. \"I've been playing with him for five straight years and every year he's gotten better.\"\nJust like with Gasol, the Griz will be in a position to determine how much they value Conley's remarkable development into a cornerstone for the franchise. Conley will become an unrestricted free agent following this season.\nHe'll have several suitors and could conceivably command a maximum-salary contract that will start well over $20 million per season.\n\"Free agency will take care of itself. I'm not worried about it,\" Conley said. \"They'll get the same answer everywhere I go. I'm not entertaining any thoughts about free agency.\"\nConley's dedication and talent on the court, and work ethic off the floor isn't all that's music to his running mates' ears.\n\"He stopped listening to Usher and he's listening to Tupac, Future. ... He's turnt up now, so his whole preparation before the game is seek and destroy now,\" Allen said. \"I like that ambition about him.\"\nTo which Conley would say his drive could never be broken.\n\"It's a great time for me in my career,\" Conley said. \"I feel great.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:28:53.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
