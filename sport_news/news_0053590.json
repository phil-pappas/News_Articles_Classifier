Finally.\nAfter 43 years, five mayors and a ton of red tape, one of the NYPD's fallen heroes was honored Monday, righting what many officers say was the department's biggest wrong.\nOfficer Phillip Cardillo was fatally shot in a 1972 ambush when he responded to a bogus emergency call at a Nation of Islam mosque in Harlem.\nThe mayor at the time, John Lindsay, largely ignored the murder, fearing racial tensions, cops from that era said.\nInstead Lindsay and then-Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy skipped Cardillo's funeral and apologized to Harlem leaders who said cops were invading the mosque.\nByron Smith/for New York Daily News Todd Cardillo tears up Monday before unveiling the street sign renamed after his father, Officer Philip Cardillo.

He's a hero because he put on that uniform and he wore that shield and he did that job the way it should be done.\"\nPolice Commissioner Bill Bratton said cops will never forget the sacrifices they make for each other and their city. He also pulled no punches when it came to years of ignoring Cardillo's service.\n\"It was a shame then and it's a shame now and today we take one step towards righting the wrong. It's wrong to give politics jurisdiction over an active crime scene,\" Bratton said. \"It was wrong then that neither the mayor nor the police commissioner attended Phil's funeral.\"\nThere was some grumbling among cops in attendance because Mayor de Blasio did not attend the ceremony.\nA spokesman for de Blasio could not immediately be reached for comment.\nRelated Stories Editorial: A slain hero’s due", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:15:39.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
