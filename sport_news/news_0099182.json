He and his teammates wanted some, too. Ethan Vinson, the lone senior, placed third to clinch a sweep at the Class 3A state cross country meet Saturday at the Gordon Cooper Technology Center. “I was ecstatic,” Vinson said of this feeling. “Senior year. We’ve been putting in the work, the miles, doing what we need to do. We weren’t expected to win. I was proud of my team to have these boys step up and help win a state championship this year. “I enjoyed it a lot. It was really great.” The belief that the team could win state originated from the beginning, Vinson (16:43.25) said. “It’s one of those things where you’ve kind of got to get that mindset, that you’re going to win, no matter what anybody else says,” Vinson said. “Or it just won’t happen.” Fortune (16:56.38) placed eighth. “It’s the most amazing feeling in the world, especially to be a sophomore on a state championship team,” Fortune said. Six Marietta runners earned medals. Four of them, thanks to their top 10 finishes, earned All-State honors. Two are freshman: Chase Waterhouse (16:58.34; ninth) and Zane Nutter (16:59.41; 10th) “The freshmen on our team, it took a lot for those guys to step up,” Fortune said. “I’m really proud of those guys.” Vinson said this feat is a result of that commitment, to persevere through those summer workouts. “You’ve just got to look at it as, you’re out here working when nobody else wants to,” Vinson said. “You’re out here doing what it takes to be a state championship. That’s pretty much all there is to it.” Fortune talked about next year, about replacing Vinson, about avoiding complacency and reaching this event on a perennial basis. “That’s the only thing we think about during practice: beating every other team we can, doing our best and setting personal records,” Fortune said. This year, Marietta won the sport’s biggest prize. “I’m ecstatic,” Marietta coach Matt Appelman said when he learned the boys team completed the sweep. “I’m so happy for the boys, who ran amazing. They’ve run really hard and done things the right way this year. “They deserve it.” Vinson counted his blessings. “We just want to thank God for what we’ve done,” Vinson said. “He’s been with us every step of the way. We’re just really excited about this. We started a tradition.” Micah McVicker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:58:23.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
