Sports after ESPN's Outside the Lines interviewed Powell on camera and wrote about the scandal in a blog post Thursday, saying he wouldn't resign.\n\"I do not want the allegations we are facing to negatively impact the other 14 institutions on what should be a great event to talk about the approaching basketball season,\" Pitino said in a statement Friday. \"I realize that while many would like to question me on the allegations, the NCAA does not permit me to speak on the subject.\"\nSyracuse 's Jim Boeheim and North Carolina 's Roy Williams went to ACC media day last year while both programs were under an NCAA investigation.\nThe Cardinals will be represented by fifth-year transfers Damion Lee and Trey Lewis . The school representative was aware that both players may be asked about the allegations but was hopeful they will be able to \"talk basketball.''\nPitino has called on former assistant Andre McGee, who is at the center of the scandal as the person who set up and paid for the escorts, to tell the truth on the matter. Earlier Friday, McGee resigned from Missouri-Kansas City as an assistant coach.\nAn NCAA and criminal investigation are ongoing.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments \"\nRick Pitino 'done talking' about recruiting accusations \"\nMonster Hurricane Patricia Makes Landfall in Mexico \"\nHoneymooners Stranded as Hurricane Patricia Hits Mexico \"\nTrump Slams Carson as 'Super Low Energy' \"\nRoyals Return to World Series, Beat Blue Jays in ALCS Game 6 \"\nTwins Denied Learner Permits for Being Too Much Alike \"\nTiny Preemie Kept Warm With Plastic Bag After Birth \"\nRoad Rage Killing Shows Broken System, Albuquerque Officials Say \"\nSee Bystanders React to a Child Being Bullied \"\nA Look at Deadly Category 5 Hurricanes That Made Landfall \"\nWhy Did Hurricane Patricia Become a Monster So Quickly? \"\nTexas to Get More Heavy Rain, Heightened Flood Threat Colorado Theater Shooter James Holmes Assaulted in Prison \"\nAuthorities: 1 Killed, 3 Wounded in Tennessee State Shooting \"\nSoldier Killed in Iraq Raid Belonged to Delta Force \"\nFBI to Help Investigate Fatal Police Shooting of Florida Man Feds Fine San Francisco Zoo Over Death of Young Gorilla \"\nPhiladelphia 76ers Throw Shade at John Kasich After Insult \"\nHundreds at Candlelight Vigil for Swedish School Stabbings \"\n43 Killed in Fiery Bus-Truck Collision in French Wine Region Fire Destroys Historic Synagogue in New Jersey \"\nAhmed Mohamed Gets His Clock Back \"\nKaty Perry Isn't Only Musician in Iowa This Weekend for Campaign \"\nFeds Seize Lethal-Injection Drugs Imported by Texas, Arizona \"\nK-9 Dog’s ‘Last Call’ Captured in Heart-Wrenching Video \"\nArk.
