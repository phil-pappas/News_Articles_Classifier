The franchise can only key on making sure it doesn’t happen again next spring. \n“You can’t go into the season ... what happened last year is last year, we’ve got to get that taste out of our mouths,” Casey insisted. \n“We’ve got to continue to get better. Defensively, we’re a step ahead, offensively, we’ve got to get our crispness , understanding how to play together. All those little things we’re still learning. \nWe want to compete (and send a message), but we can’t go out there thinking about what happened last year.” \nOne voice of dissent Thursday was backup swingman Terrence Ross, who was given an out, when asked if the opponent didn’t matter because it wasn’t a real game. \n“Oh no, it’s a big deal,” Ross said. \n“Anytime somebody beats you 4-0, you remember it. I think we’ll go in there and really play our regular-season style of basketball and play like it’s the regular season.” \nThat would certainly please Casey, who, like Patterson, said the revamped roster and pre-season minute distribution has left the club not quite yet in sync for the contests that matter. \nThe hope is that against Washington, the fluidness and cohesiveness the coaching staff is looking for takes a significant step forward. \nAnd if the team beats up on a familiar foe, that would just be a bonus, with bigger opportunities to inflict some payback looming down the line. \nSTARTERS WON’T VARY \nCasey still has not revealed who will start at power forward, though Patterson remains the favourite. \n“Each player brings something good to the table. Pat brings his three-point shooting. (Luis) Scola brings his experience and knowledge. (Anthony Bennett) brings his athletic ability, his defence. James Johnson brings a lot, defence is a strength, driving the ball,” he said. \nThe problem — and it’s a good one to have, compared to not having enough talent — is that each player has shown enough to warrant playing time, but there is only a limited amount available. \n“All of them bring something to the table, we’re very pleased with all of them, we’ve just got four of them and probably only two, maybe 1.5 can play,” Casey said. \n“Those other 1.5 guys are going to have to be ready when their number is called, be professional, be motivated, be the best cheerleader they can be and be a pro.” \nCasey said he will have a set starter and primary backup and will not interchange them depending on matchups. The starter will always begin games with the first five, though minutes will vary depending on the matchups. \nWhile Patterson and Scola are expected to take up most of the playing time, Casey has consistently praised Bennett’s defensive abilities and it appears the former No. 1 overall pick has worked his way into the rotation. \nFEELING BETTER \nRoss has been one of Toronto’s best defenders so far and a return to health has a lot to do with his fine play on that end. \nRoss played through an ankle issue last season and its impact showed on the court, where he struggled through his worst NBA campaign. \nWith that ankle now surgically repaired, Ross has helped the team’s reserve group look at times terrifying defensively. \nIt starts with Cory Joseph’s initial pressure , and Bismack Biyombo’s imposing presence at the rim also goes a long way, but Ross has been a disruptive force as well. \nFeeling better physically has gone a long way. \nRoss said he now feels more durable and is able to move around better — cutting, planting, etc. \n“That’s the biggest part, not getting stuck trying to take off,” Ross said. \n“I feel like I’ve got a little more quickness back.” \nRoss leads the team with eight steals (1.6 per game) and has also blocked five shots. He blocked 14 his entire rookie season and had 25 rejections last season. \nHe has not fared well on offence, but believes that will come around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:21:20.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
