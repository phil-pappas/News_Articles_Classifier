Before that he witnessed the Pope's address to Congress in Washington, D.C. \n\"There was really an intense wanting among members of Congress, Supreme Court, cabinet, and other guests who were there, to really hear the message that he was saying,\" Swain said. \"And his message was an encouraging one, to seek the common good, to get along with one another, to talk to one another. It was a very powerful statement that he was addressing, not just to the Congress, but to all of us, in all of our daily lives.\" \nPope Francis' message, poise and charisma have been making headlines for some time. We wanted to see what these three KELOLAND residents thought about the so-called \"Francis Effect.\" \n\"Well that's obviously the hope. You can't tell what goes [on] in [an] individual heart. Certainly there's more interest, there's discussion, there's an acceptance, of at least listening to him, and see what his message carries,\" Swain said. \n\"I think there is something happening here that brings great hope because I think his message is connecting to a lot of people that, in a new way… The doctrine is still the same, but the way he's conveying it with great joy, I think people are responding with just enthusiasm,\" Colene Ridder said. \"Because he is speaking truths, and it's not something that's changed, but I think that he brings just great hope and joy, and it's exciting.” \nGlenn Ridder also sees a broader papal impact. \n\"Oh I do, I definitely do, that there's a Francis Effect, not so much only Francis, but Francis follows Pope John Paul, and Pope Benedict, all have the same kind of philosophy, and he just building on it,\" he said. \nAnd building a stronger following as a result. \n\"I certainly think that he's established himself as someone to listen to, what does he think about this or that, as a real spiritual leader,\" Swain said. \"He's not a politician. He has no votes, no armies or anything. It's just the spiritual and moral voice, and that's a powerful presence in a world where there's so much seeming chaos.\" \nThe Ridders planned their visit to see Pope Francis. Yet, in a huge surprise, they were also able to see another special person on their trip- their daughter, Sister Cephas Maria, who's now a novice with Mother Theresa's Missionaries of Charity order. \n\"And there, our daughter, happened to be one that we encountered in a sea of people, of that many, and that was, there was no previous connection, no cell phone contact,\" Colene Ridder said. \nNow that the Ridders are back home and far from the bright lights and the masses of people in Philadelphia, the flames of faith are still burning. \n\"I do feel it's going forward with great enthusiasm and fire,\" Colene said. \"I just, I don't think it's just a high. I think there's something so profound that's happening as we reach out to one another as brothers and sisters. I think this is something that will carry forth, and it's exciting.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:54:48.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
