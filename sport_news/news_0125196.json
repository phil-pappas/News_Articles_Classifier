The army added that these police and soldier companies will conduct joint operations.\nThe decision was made in the midst of another day of attacks around the country that left three Israelis dead and more than 20 wounded.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his 10-person security cabinet in a marathon session Tuesday day night to draw up additional measures in an effort to stop the wave of violence.\nThe security cabinet approved measures that Netanyahu promised the Knesset would convince the enemy that “terrorism does not pay.”\nThe cabinet convened at 3:30 in the afternoon, broke briefly so Netanyahu could address the Knesset to mark 14 years since the assassination of tourism minister Rehavam Ze’evi, and then re-convened at 7 p.m. for a meeting that continued until early Wednesday morning.\nA number of measures were approved, including sending IDF soldiers to city centers and highways throughout the country to re-enforce the police forces.\nSome of the other measures that the security cabinet passed included:\n- the authority for police to close or surround areas in Jerusalem where there is friction or incitement;\n- in addition to destroying terrorists' homes, it will now not be permitted to rebuild at the site of the demolitions;\n- the seizure of terrorists' assets;\n- the revoking of the permanent resident status of east Jerusalem Arabs involved in attacks.\nThe prime minister's office said that the security cabinet would reconvene on Wednesday afternoon to deal with other issues including incitement of the violence.\nMeanwhile, the IDF deployed two additional battalions to its Judea and Samaria Division; three companies to the Jerusalem-West Bank perimeter area; and two reinforcement battalions to the Gaza border to deal with disturbances along the security fence.\nThe Golani infantry brigade will send its Battalion 12 and Reconnaissance Battalion to the Gaza border.\nThe IDF has yet to name the other units being deployed.\nYaakov Lappin contributed to this report.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:46:25.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
