I think I could dream of what it looks like, but the level of passion that New Yorkers have for their ball clubs, I think I would sell them far too short. I hope we’re able to give it to ’em, and I think it’ll be a lot of fun.\nQ: You’re carrying the hopes and dreams of Mets fans now. \nA: It’s fun. This is what we signed up for. This was the expectations heading into spring training, and these have been the expectations all year. I think we’re up to the challenge.\nQ: You have no doubt in your mind you will make Mets fans proud? \nA: I think so. For me looking at it, we’re gonna play the game hard and we’re gonna play it right. Hopefully, we play it well, and I think we’ve done that for 162 ballgames, and so hopefully that carries over into the postseason.\nQ: What makes this team unique, or what do you like best about this team? \nA: It’s a really good group of guys. Every guy sincerely cheers for the next guy, which doesn’t always happen. There is a level of, I would say, kind of looking out for yourself in this game that we inherently are aware of, but I don’t feel that on this team. It’s a selfless ballclub.\nQ: What mindset will this team carry into the playoffs? \nA: The mindset is we’re supposed to be here. … Hats off to the organization for seeing some opportunities to improve us. I think the biggest deal we made all year was probably David Wright. You get a six-time All-Star back in the middle of August, that doesn’t happen. And then to add guys like Yoenis Cespedes and Kelly Johnson, (Juan) Uribe and (Tyler) Clippard, felt like the front office saw an opportunity to improve our ballclub and they took a chance, and then I feel like we were able to take advantage of it.\nQ: What makes Cespedes such an intimidating hitter? \nA: No part of the ballpark is off limits to him, and he understands that. When you understand that as a hitter that you can do damage to any part of the ballpark, it allows you to see the ball longer, and that’s why he’s able to hit so many pitches, because he gives himself so much time. He’s a complete freak of nature. I mean, he’s so good. It’s so much fun to watch, and he has absolutely been a fantastic teammate.\nQ: Lucas Duda? \nA: Lucas works so hard at his craft. He’s a student of the game — always paying attention, always looking to improve what it is he’s doing. And also, he puts in a lot of work on the defensive side of the ball too.\nQ: Wilmer Flores? \nWilmer Flores, Daniel Murphy and Yoenis Cespedes Photo: Getty Images A: I think Flo is the perfect picture that this game is played by human beings. We’re humans. I think that goes back to what happened at the trade deadline. Like this game is played by humans. It’s easy for people to forget, it’s easy for us to forget, even our teammates that Flo is a son, he’s a brother, and one day he’s gonna be a husband and a father. It’s played by flesh-and-blood human beings. And it was refreshing for people, myself included, to get a reminder of that. That just because a lot of guys were able to make the game look easy, it’s hard, and it’s played by humans.\nQ: Did you say anything to him that night? \nA: I talked to him underneath in the dugout, and told him I loved him. We weren’t sure what was going on. Once we got to the end of the game and found out he was still with us, I think we were all ecstatic about it.\nQ: Travis d’Arnaud? \nA: Trav … Trav has quietly … had an unbelievable year. Like it goes under the radar with the way he plays defense behind the plate, you start plugging his numbers into 135 ballgames, this guy’s an MVP candidate with what he’s done offensively and the way he handles the staff and how good he is at framing pitches. He is so good at framing pitches. And I’m at second base, and there’ ll be pitches that I’m like, “I think that’s a ball,” he makes it look like a strike. It’s impressive.\nQ: Michael Cuddyer? \nA: He’s been a really good calming influence on a group of guys like myself who haven’t been to the playoffs, I’ve never really done this before. And also, he has really, really played well in the second half, and he’s a guy that has flourished in the role that he has, when I feel like you could find so many veteran players as established as he is, who wouldn’t have taken as kindly to that role.\nDaniel Murphy and Curtis Granderson Photo: Bill Kostroun Q: Curtis Granderson? \nA: Curtis brings energy every day. He’s the same guy every day. I’ve said this before, that I long to be as consistent of a human being as Curtis is. Like you don’t know if Curtis is hitting .350, .250 or .150 … (if) he’s got 30 homers or three homers. He’s the same guy every day. I say it all the time to my wife, like I wish that I could do that.\nQ: Jacob deGrom? \nA: I think he’s gonna be excited. Jake is cool because he’s one of those guys you look for in baseball — he doesn’t really have a pulse. Heart rate stays really, really low. I’ve never been to the playoffs, but that seems like that would be a really good attribute to have. Not a lot fazes him. All the guys on our team, I would pick him as one of the guys that will be able to settle in the quickest.\nQ: Matt Harvey Monday night Game 3 at Citi Field: How amped up is he going to be? \nA: I think he will be. He’s still got the great stuff, but he knows what it looks like to get through a lineup. He knows when to pick his spots, he knows when to not pick his spots. He’s turning into a veteran, I feel like even from second base like right in front of my eyes. Like he knows that he’s got 97, 98 in the back pocket, but he knows that to get deep into ball games, that might not always be necessary. And so it’s been cool to see the evolution of Matt Harvey from second base, that he’s grown up, like over the course of just this season, he’s grown up, especially coming off Tommy John last year. I don’t want to say … like it’s not finesse … but he knows how to manipulate his way through a lineup. But he’s doing it at 94, 95, so that’s been a lot of fun.\nQ: Noah Syndergaard? \nA: He throws real hard. He’s starting to really figure out how to add and subtract, how to pull back on his changeup, when to go harder here, when to go in and out. Him and Travis have done a great job together. They’re really figuring out what it looks like to get through a lineup.\nQ: How will Jon Niese handle being in the bullpen? \nA: I think he’s understanding in the bullpen that he might not have enough time when he comes in to use all four of his pitches the way he would in a start. Whatever my best second weapon is off the fastball, I might only have time to get to that.\nQ: Bartolo Colon? \nA: Wherever Trav sets up, that’s where he puts it. And the cool thing about Bartolo is, I firmly believe that he’s got 92, 93, 94 in there, there’s no doubt — he just knows he doesn’t need it.\nDaniel Murphy and Jeurys Familia Photo: AP Q: Jeurys Familia? \nA: When Familia started throwing that splitter, he became the nastiest guy on earth. I think he has shown maturity beyond his years to take the role, and not just succeed in it, but to just grow, and absolutely revel in it. I think him becoming our closer was one of the best things that happened to us all year.\nQ: Terry Collins? \nA: I feel like he pressed the right buttons all year.\nQ: Did you dream about being in a World Series as a kid? \nA: I just liked to play baseball, and I loved watching baseball, so I guess yeah ’cause I always felt like the Braves were in the World Series so that always looked like a lot of fun. I remember Andruw Jones hitting those two home runs I think in Yankee Stadium like when was … like 14 years old, or whatever (chuckle). So yeah, it’s something I thought about. Thought it would be a pretty cool thing to do.\nQ: What does this moment mean to you, after all the hardships? \nA: I think, for me, it’s just really a lot of fun. Try not to worry about too much of what’s gonna happen tomorrow. I think today has enough worry for itself. And enjoy the moment.\nQ: Did you over the years watch the playoffs? \nA: I would a little bit. More before I got married. So my brother and I used to live together and we’d watch and talk the game. And then as I got married and he got married, if it was on I would watch it, but it wasn’t something I would schedule my day around. The offseason, especially very early in the offseason, try to pour back into my wife and my son because they’ve given SO much to allow me to even do this for the last … eight months.\nQ: How tough was it knowing that every October since you’ve been up here, you’ve gone home? \nA: It’s frustrating. You go in each spring training preparing yourself and expecting to win and put yourself in a position to win a championship, so there’s a level of frustration to it. But I think, looking at it from a positive perspective, it makes it all the more sweeter, now that we’ve put ourselves in this position.\nQ: This will be your first playoff game. Do you think you’ll have butterflies? \nA: I’d say probably so, I’ll probably have some. Definitely try to settle into the game … you know, not try to hit it 600 feet or make an unbelievable play. And hopefully it slows down as we go on.\nBrian Schneider and Billy Wagner in 2008. Photo: Charles Wenzelberg Q: What do you recall about your major league debut in ’08? \nA: It was August 2nd. Was blessed enough to have my father and brother able to come, in Houston. I remember it was moving really fast, just kind of the whole day. I got a base hit my first at-bat, and then I was able to make a play in the outfield that I was surprised to make. I remember Billy Wagner and Brian Schneider kind of telling me, “Just relax. This is where you’re supposed to be.”\nQ: Teammates in ’08: Johan Santana? \nA: I remember he took the ball on three days’ rest at the end of the season and threw a gem against the Marlins. Always such a competitor, especially down the stretch, he threw the ball so well for us. He was a great teammate. He was always more athletic than I thought. I always underestimated his athleticism.\nQ: Pedro Martinez? \nA: He told me when I first got to Houston, he said, “I knew you would play in the big leagues.” I was like, “Man, I wish you would have told ME that, ’cause I didn’t think I was gonna play in the big leagues” when he rehabbed with us. Pedro was really good to me. He had some guys out to his house in 2008 in Connecticut. He was really, really good to me.\nQ: Carlos Beltran? \nA: Really enjoyed Carlos. He, I think, helped to show me what it looked like to love Jesus and play baseball, and the two don’t have to be mutually exclusive. And I was able to watch his walk with Christ, and also everything else that goes on with being who he is in New York City. It really was a cool picture to be a family man, to be a husband, to be a father, and to be able to keep Christ in the center of it. So whenever I talk to Carlos now at second, I always ask him how his walk is. And he always would go out of his way to take younger guys out to eat and stuff like that.\nQ: Jose Reyes? \nA: Oh Hosie. Hosie was just like an absolute huge ball of energy. I remember taking ground balls from first base one time in spring training with him and he threw it across the diamond, coming across the diamond on the run. … I remember thinking to myself like the field was too small for him. I felt like he needed a bigger field. He was so athletic, but he’s always bigger than you think. Hosie’s like 6-1, 6-2, he’s always bigger than you think. Hosie brought it every day. He was exciting. He was a really really good teammate, I really enjoyed my time with him.\nMurphy and Wright in 2012. Photo: Getty Images Q: David Wright in ’08. \nA: David took a lot of my money in cards. I didn’t have much. But he tried to take what I did have. That was how I learned how to play cards. It was an expensive way to learn how, but it was fun. David showed me, and is still showing me, what it looks like to be a pro, every day. I love David.\nQ: Your son Noah is 18 months old. Does he pick up the ball or anything? \nA: Yeah he can hit. I got videos of him hitting (finds on phone).\nQ: Is he lefty or righty? \nA: Left-handed. Throws right-handed. (Shows video). And that’s him swinging, like a guitar, earlier today. I have some videos I think in there somewhere.\nQ: How did he get started doing this? \nA: I think he just watches me. Like he watches the games.\nQ: Your wife is eight months pregnant. \nA: She’s an absolute rock star that she’s still chasing our son around with a baby brewing in her belly right now. I think, for me, she’s the absolute picture of what a woman should look like, and I love her so much for it.\nQ: Do you think about this possibly being your last hurrah as a Met? \nA: I try not to. Like I said, today has enough worry for itself. When I get done with this interview, I get to go home, try to pour back into my wife, serve her, serve my son. So, tomorrow is gonna take care of itself, I put that in the hands of Jesus. He has not failed me yet, I don’t expect Him to fail me two months from now when I’m a free agent. I know that this organization has done more for me than I think any other organization in baseball would have done, and I love ’em for it.\nQ: How would you sum up your New York Met years? \nA: Fun. Grew a lot. I think I went from a boy, hopefully, into a man. I think that might be a better question for my wife. But I like to think I’ve grown from a boy into a man, and this organization has helped me do that.\nQ: What do you hope Mets fans say about Daniel Murphy? \nA: That guy played the game the right way.\nQ: So what message would you give Mets fans as you begin this journey? \nA: Enjoy the ride.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under daniel murphy ,  new york mets ,  serby's q&a", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:59:49.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
