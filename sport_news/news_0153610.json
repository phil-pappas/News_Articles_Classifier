He’s got that streak that runs through him that you need to be a top manager.\"He has learnt from Sir Alex Ferguson over the years, he is learning from Van Gaal now. He is taking his time, doing all the right things, and without a doubt all Man United fans would like to see Giggsy, at some point, be manager of Manchester United.\"To have played for the club the amount he has and have that appreciation and understanding of how Manchester United is, he would be perfect at some point to step in.\"Beckham, 40, who played with Giggs for United from 1992 until 2003 will return to Old Trafford on November 14 to play for a Britain & Northern Ireland XI, managed by Ferguson.They will play a Rest of the World XI managed by Carlo Ancelotti and captained by Zinedine Zidane with proceeds going to United Nations children's agency UNICEF. \nImage: Ryan Giggs \nPhotograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images Source: © Copyright 2015 Reuters Limited.
