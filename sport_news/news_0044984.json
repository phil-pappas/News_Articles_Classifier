Jonas Jerebko missed practice after returning to the United States and now Smart has developed the issue too. \nHead coach Brad Stevens said the guard could potentially miss both games this week. After visiting the Nets, the Celtics will stay in New York for a meeting with the Knicks. \n\"I would anticipate him not being on our early leg of the trip,\" Stevens told reporters before Tuesday's practice. \"He might join us on Thursday but he's got what everybody else had plus a fever and everything else. So we've gone through that a little bit with our roster. And hopefully we're nearing the end of it.\" \nGiven all the recent health problems, Stevens wanted to wait before announcing which regulars will rest Wednesday. He said he could sit two other guys, including Avery Bradley. That would leave the whole starting backcourt plus rookie Terry Rozier (swollen knee) out of commission. \nStevens said he could shift Isaiah Thomas and Evan Turner into the first unit. The latter guard will be making his preseason debut after dealing with a strained right knee in Europe. \n\"I think he was anxious to play in Madrid and Milan, but I think obviously it was smart to be safe with that right now, be conservative with holding him out right now,\" Stevens said. \"But he'll be excited to play. Evan likes basketball. If there was a game at the Y tomorrow and Evan wasn't in the NBA, he'd probably find it. So I mean, he's one of the guys that for 82 games you don't worry about the passion ever becoming a factor.\" \n\"(Against Brooklyn) with Marcus and Terry out, Evan will play a lot of point,\" the coach added. \"That's the benefit of having Evan. Evan is a guy that can play a number of different positions and do so on a whim. It's a skill in and of itself. Those are two things about Evan that we just mentioned earlier that I just think separate him in a lot of ways, is that he's got positional versatility and he loves to play basketball. And I know it sounds like everybody should but not everybody's that way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:24:06.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
