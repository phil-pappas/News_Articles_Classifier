Cindi West of the King County Sheriff's Office. The couple were reported missing when they didn't show up for a birthday party for one of their five children, West said.\n\"They are experienced day-hikers but we don't know if they had the 10 essentials,'' West said.\nThe couple's car was found late Sunday at the trailhead -- about 45 miles east of Seattle. Temperatures dipped into the upper 40s as a steady rain fell Sunday night and early Monday along the heavily wooded trail.\nWest said ground searchers will concentrate their efforts on two locations along the Pratt River Trail where others who have become lost are often found.\n\"It's not unusual for people to get lost on this trail,\" West said, adding that there is no cellular phone service along the trail.\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d43127.4989618689!2d-121.59914886866812!3d47.50026299324028!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x549a7fd700cc91bb%3A0x86a3ed9e86cb2440!2sPratt+River%2C+Washington!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1445876969763", "https://twitter.com/ORweather", "http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/pratt-river-trail"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:08:04.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
