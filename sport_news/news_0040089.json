Lehtonen made his season debut after backing up Antti Niemi in the first two games.\nThe Stars had 52 shots, their most since Feb. 3, 1990, in a 7-6 loss to Philadelphia. Spezza finished off the hat trick with an empty-net goal.\nMcDavid, selected No. 1 overall in the June draft, scored in the second period to pull the Oilers even at 2 after they had fallen behind 2-0.\nAnders Nilsson made 48 saves in his first appearance for Edmonton, but he couldn’t stop Spezza when the Dallas forward took a dump-off pass from Antoine Roussel in the slot.\nMcDavid almost scored Edmonton’s first goal when he appeared to tip a shot by defenceman Oscar Klefbom, who got credit for the goal.\nBut McDavid didn’t have to wait much longer, redirecting a long shot by Andrej Sekera past Lehtonen less than 2 minutes later midway through the second period.\nThe quick scoring burst ended a 90-minute home scoreless streak to start the season for the Stars, who got a shutout from Niemi in the season opener. Lehtonen, the starter for five seasons in Dallas, finished with 26 saves.\nMcDavid struggled in the faceoff circle again, winning just three of nine to put him at 8 of 33 for the season. He had three shots in 16 minutes.\nSpezza opened the scoring late in the first period by sneaking a shot between Nilsson’s pad and the left post on a shot with almost no angle along the boards not far from the goal line.\nJamie Benn, last season’s Art Ross Trophy winner as the NHL’s top scorer, put Dallas up 2-0 by easily beating Nilsson on a wraparound goal early in the second.\n Rinne makes 31 saves as Nashville Predators blank Edmonton Oilers 2-0\nTopics: Edmonton Oilers Dallas Stars Comments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:04:39.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
