Posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 1:27 am | Updated: 1:33 am, Wed Oct 21, 2015. Panthers pounce on Patriots 58-14: Garrett, Hedge score TDs as MALC falls against another tough foe By DANIEL McKILLOP The Daily News MohaveDailyNews.com | 0 comments \nBULLHEAD CITY — The Patriots returned to Bullhead City from Surprise early Sunday morning after facing another Arizona Interscholastic Association Division V powerhouse. \nMohave Accelerated Learning Center’s football team has faced five of the top teams in its division — no less the state — during its second season as an AIA member. \nThe Patriots fell to the 6-2 overall, No. 127-ranked Panthers 54-18 at Paradise Honors High School on Saturday night. \nMALC also has fallen 60-0 to 6-2 overall, No. 70-ranked Tempe Prep team on Aug. 21; and MALC lost 56-0 to the 7-0 overall, No. 55-ranked Joy Christian squad on Oct. 11. \nThe Patriots were knocked off 47-7 by the 7-1 overall, No. 107-ranked Scottsdale Christian club on Sept. 18, and the Patriots were blanked 45-0 by the 7-1, No. 116-ranked Tonopah Valley High School unit on Sept. 25. \nThe above-mentioned football programs are ranked among all five AIA divisions. \nDespite the stiff competition, Patriots head coach Steve Price said, “We came out flat.” \nHe added, “I don’t know if it was the trip or what. I think the first half we gave up 23 special team points.” \nEthan Salcedo ran a kickoff and a punt back for touchdowns and Josh Essegian ran a kickoff back for a touchdown for the Panthers, according to maxpreps.com . Brandon Brown recorded a safety. \n“It was like 44-7 at halftime,” Price said. Fundamentally, we played a little bit better in the second half, but when you’re down that much you’re just trying to claw your way back out of there. \n“That was kind of how it rolled out, but we didn’t give up — that’s for sure.” \nWe made a couple of adjustments at halftime, but ... it’s a tough deal, but that’s the way it goes.” \nThe first-year MALC head coach said his Patriots are preparing for their 7 p.m. on Friday at Chino Valley High School against the Cougars game. \n“Going forward in the future we’re just going to have to step up our game all around,” Price said. “You know, we’re playing good teams. One or two things make a difference. It’s the difference between a 2-7 team and a 4-5 team.” \nThe AIA Division V Patriots are 2-7 overall and 1-2 in Section III. \nMatt Garrett scored on a 15-yard TD run in the second quarter, and Billy Hendlin tossed a 15-yard TD pass to Andrew Hedge in the third quarter for MALC’s points. \nSekou Tyler gained 110 yards on eight carries with three TD runs to lead the Panthers’ offense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:23:01.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
