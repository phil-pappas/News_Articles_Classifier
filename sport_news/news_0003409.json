(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Sponsored Links The Associated Press NEW ORLEANS — \nProud veterans Drew Brees and Ben Watson summoned their best performances of the season and restored a bit of swagger to the recently reeling Saints. \nBrees passed for 312 yards, Watson racked up a career-high 127 yards receiving to go with a fourth-down touchdown catch, and New Orleans handed the Atlanta Falcons their first loss of the season with a 31-21 win on Thursday night. \n\"Obviously, Ben Watson had a huge night,\" Brees said. \"Either his number was called or he was just getting open. He was getting some opportunities and, man, he made the most of it.\" \nDesperate for a victory, the Saints (2-4) enjoyed big plays in all phases, a common occurrence when New Orleans hosts night games. Including the playoffs, the Saints have now won 19 of 21 games in the Superdome in prime time. \nMichael Mauti, who grew up near New Orleans after his father, Rich, played for the Saints, blocked a punt and recovered it for a touchdown, delighting the Superdome crowd with a play reminiscent of Steve Gleason's famous block against Atlanta in 2006. \nGleason, now paralyzed by ALS, was at the game, watching from his motorized wheel chair. \n\"The cool thing was that Steve was here to see that,\" Brees said. \"It brought back some good memories. Obviously we got to add to that tonight as well.\" \nMark Ingram ran for two short touchdowns, and New Orleans' defense recovered three fumbles — two inside its own 20. \nDevonta Freeman rushed for 100 yards, including a 25-yard TD, for Atlanta (5-1). Matt Ryan passed for 295 yards and two TDs. \nFreeman also turned a short pass into a 13-yard touchdown, but by then it was too late for the Falcons. \n\"We made mistakes early on and it cost us,\" Freeman said. \"I feel like we beat ourselves, but they're a talented team and they did a lot of great things tonight.\" \nFreeman's first touchdown cut New Orleans' lead to 24-14 with 13:07 remaining, putting pressure on the Saints to answer. \nThe Saints responded with the type of will-imposing drive that was commonplace during much of the decade since coach Sean Payton and Brees arrived in New Orleans, but seldom seen this season. \nNew Orleans drove 80 yards in 11 plays, eating about five minutes off the clock. During the series, Watson tied a career high with his 10th catch of the game. Brees found Brandon Cooks for 26 yards on one third down. Ingram capped the drive by powering in for his second TD to make it 31-14. \nThat wasn't the only example of the revival of the Saints' offense. Late in the third quarter, the Saints capped a 10-play, 63 yard drive by first drawing Atlanta offside on fourth-and-goal from the four, then kept the offense on the field and converted a 2-yard pass to Watson. \n\"That's a huge momentum-gaining-type play in a game like that, and it took some marbles to call it,\" Brees said, summing up the night as \"validation.\" \n\"For it all to come together like that, it just gives us a glimpse of what we can be,\" he said. \nThe Saints never trailed, racing in front on the opening series, an 80-yard drive capped by Ingram's first TD. \nMauti made it 14-0 when he smothered Matt Bosher's punt attempt, scooped up the ball as he landed and danced into the end zone. \nAtlanta cut it to 14-7 on Ryan's 7-yard pass to Roddy White, but the Falcons, who outgained the Saints 265-174 in the half, squandered a pair of promising drives with fumbles. First, rookie Tevin Coleman coughed up the ball on a tackle by Jairus Byrd as linebacker Dannell Ellerbe punched the ball out from behind and cornerback Brandon Browner recovered on the 9. Later, Ryan mishandled a snap and Ellerbe recovered on the New Orleans 17. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:51:42.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
