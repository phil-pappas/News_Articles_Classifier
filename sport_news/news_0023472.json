The Jackson High School junior was doing her best to put the finishing touches on a banner day for the Polar Bears cross country program. Greta Taylor later appeared and practically ended all doubt. A 1-2 finish from Chapman and Taylor led Jackson to the girls team title and wrapped up a sweep for the host Polar Bears at Saturday’s Federal League championships. Less than an hour earlier, Jackson won the boys team title behind Nate Mallue’s runner-up finish. Chapman ran a winning time of 18:29.4, 38 seconds faster than Taylor. Teammates Gigi Kinney and Alexa Smith also finished in the top 10. “It’s actually very astonishing,” Chapman said. “We’ve worked so hard this year and we deserve it.” Michaela Huffman also helped the Polar Bears to a 40-point win over Perry and GlenOak. The Panthers were declared runners-up on a tiebreaker. The league title is the first for the Jackson girls since 2012. “This year’s seniors won it their freshman year and they wanted to go out with a bang,” Chapman said. Chapman appeared in command of the girls race most of the way. She took the lead early and never let up. “I felt really good,” Chapman said. “I want to thank all the spectators for cheering. Without that, I couldn’t have run as well as I did.” Mallue ran a 15:54.6 to lead the Jackson boys. Jaylon Grimes and Nick Huffman finished in the top 10, while Jared Marsh and Zach Werstler also contributed to a 21-point win over defending champion Lake. The Jackson boys won their first league title since 2011. “It just means a lot that we could come out on our home course and win,” Mallue said. “I was telling the guys before the race that even in middle school, we never lost on this course. Today we didn’t want to let that happen. “That was our main goal, to win this as a team today. I’m happy with how it played out.” Mallue pushed himself into contention for the individual title. He took the lead with about three-quarters of a mile to go, but Green’s Stewart Schmidt soon passed him. Schmidt finished just over five seconds ahead of Mallue. Lake’s Conner Delahanty and Joe Zwick also pushed Mallue down the stretch. “They’re all great runners,” Mallue said. “I knew Stew, Joe Zwick and Delahanty would probably be up front. “When we were coming out of the woods with a little less than a mile to go, I think it was just me, Stew and Conner. I was like ‘I gotta go now.’ I made a strong move and tried to break them a little bit. Stew hung on with me and helped me push to a strong finish. It was a PR today.” Page 2 of 2 - Reach Mike at 330-580-8341 or mike.popovich @cantonrep.com.
