Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. With 1:55 left in the game, 2,500 fans were on the edge of their Dunlavy Field seats Friday night, all nervous and excited about what was about to happen. Calaveras had just scored a touchdown to come within one point of Sonora and was going for a two-point conversion to take the lead and maybe win the game. “He’s a riverboat gambler,” said Sonora head coach Bryan Craig of the Redskins head coach Jason Weatherby. “We were ready for him to go for two, we knew that was going to be the case. He’ll fake it from anywhere on the field. He keeps you on your toes.” The smallest person on the field came up with maybe the biggest play of the game. First-time starter, the 5-foot-4, 150-pound senior Jesus Rodriguez, intercepted a pass in the end zone to preserve Sonora’s lead and, eventually, the 28-27 victory. “I thought I got taller,” Rodriguez said. “It was going through my mind, we can’t let them score now, I’ve gotta fight for my team. When the ball was in the air, I was thinking I’ve gotta make this play. I’ve gotta work harder and jump higher. I’m just really happy. The coaches finally gave me a chance. I’ve worked harder and harder every week and I finally proved myself to the coaches. I’m proud of what I did and what my team did.” “It was the best,” said Wildcat linebacker/fullback Bradley Canepa. “When he jumped up and caught it, my heart rose. I was so excited he caught it. Everybody was.” The celebration was short-lived because Calaveras recovered the onside kick and the Wildcats were on defense again. But the celebration kicked into full gear when sophomore Kane Rogers intercepted his seventh pass of the season, leaping and reaching high to snare the ball out of the air to end all Redskins’ hopes. “Coach said play deep and I did what he told me to do,” Rogers said. “I jumped for it and I wasn’t letting anyone else get it but me.” “Not just that interception, he makes a huge reception to set up a touchdown, he makes a big block for Sammy,” Craig said. “But let’s talk about that big mistake he made on that punt … he’s a tremendous talent and he’s maturing. And we’re seeing that right before our eyes. He still has some things to learn but with the exception of a couple of plays, I would be saying he’s the Heisman trophy winner right now.” The Wildcats were able to run out the clock and celebrate their fifth consecutive victory. “It was a crazy game, Canepa said. “They were big and fast and we knew that from camp this summer, they’re a well-coached team every year. It’s always fun playing Calaveras because we know we’re gonna get a physical game and that’s how we like it.” Sonora (5-1, 2-0 Mother Lode League) trailed 7-0 after the first quarter and didn’t get on the board until Canepa plunged in from the 1 on fourth down halfway through the second quarter. The Redskins took advantage of a Wildcat bad snap on a punt and drove 16 yards in two plays to take a 14-7 lead into halftime. Sonora tied the game on the opening drive of the second half on a Wyatt Faughnan 5-yard burst around the left end. The Wildcats took their first lead, 21-14, near the end of the third period on a Sammy Page 12-yard pass to Ian Cicero. Calaveras tied it with 5:27 left in the game to set up Sonora’s game-winning drive. Page kept the ball from the 6-yard line and plowed into the end zone with the help of a devastating block from Rogers. “Sammy pulled it, I thought he was going to pitch it to me, but he kept it and I ran up and blocked for him and put some guy on his back,” Rogers said. “It was a great run by Sammy.” “Sammy worked his butt off all day today,” Canepa said. “He showed today how he is the quarterback of this league and how he can run the ball. That play was amazing.” “I heard Kane’s block was pretty good,” Page said. “I pulled it with my read and it was one-on-one with the cornerback and I turned it up and knew I could beat him.” Page finished with a game-high 84 yards on 15 carries and also completed five of eight passes for 59 yards and a score. “Sammy is on his game,” Craig said. “He worked really hard all week, watched a lot of film and it showed tonight. He’s the reason the offense was very productive tonight.” Also for Sonora, Rogers finished with 63 yards on seven carries, Canepa 59 on 14 totes and Nate Gookin had 31 on eight attempts. Overall, the Wildcats rushed for 245 yards. “Hard work pays off,” Page said. “We learned a good lesson last week. We came into film Saturday morning, worked our butts off Monday with focus and it all paid off. We played great tonight. They’re a great football team, they’re a tough football team. And we’re a great football team and an even tougher team.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:35:04.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
