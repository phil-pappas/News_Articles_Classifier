Watt"], "text": "J.J. Watt dresses as Batman to visit... \nHarvey faced the Cubs only once in 2015 and went seven scoreless innings. \n\"We got here because we have very, very good pitching. In the middle of summer when we weren't scoring any runs, we were still in games. We'd still win close games because our pitching kept us in it,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"Our starters, our bullpens, they're young, yeah, they're inexperienced. But they've got quality stuff, and that still pays off. That's why we've said all along, no matter what the outcome of the season is, the light at the end of the tunnel is here, and this is going to be a bright future for this organization.\" \nThe Cubs announced Thursday that Jon Lester would start Game 1 and Jake Arrieta in Game 2. \nThe Mets advanced to the first NLCS since 2006. They did so by beating Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, two of baseball's top pitchers, in the first and final games of the series. \n\"We came into a five-game series and you saw Kershaw twice and Greinke twice. That may not be fair,\" Collins said Thursday night. \"But we'll take what we got. We got the wins that we needed, and we're going to go party for a little while, and take a day off and get ready for the NLCS and it will be a lot of fun.\" \n---Major League Baseball announced the umpires who have been assigned to the League Championship Series. \nThe crew chiefs will be 32-year major league umpire John Hirschbeck and 19-year veteran Ted Barrett, both of whom served in that capacity for the wild-card games. \nHirschbeck will lead the American League Championship Series crew, marking his 19th career postseason assignment, including his fifth LCS. His crew will consist of Laz Diaz, Dan Iassogna, regular-season crew chief Jeff Nelson, Tony Randazzo and Hunter Wendelstedt. Randazzo will be the home plate umpire in Game 1. Hirschbeck, Nelson, Reynolds and Wendelstedt worked the NL wild-card games. \nUmpire Jim Reynolds will serve as the ALCS replay official in Games 1 and 2, with the assistance of fellow umpire Mike Estabrook, before Randazzo shifts into that role beginning in Game 3. Iassogna was a replay official for a wild-card game this postseason. \nThe ALCS began Friday night between the Kansas City Royals and the Toronto Blue Jays. \nBarrett will oversee the crew assigned to the NLCS. This is his 21st career postseason assignment, including his seventh LCS. Barrett will work alongside Eric Cooper, Rob Drake, Paul Emmel, Tim Timmons and regular-season crew chief Bill Miller. Drake will call balls and strikes in Game 1 of the NLCS. Barrett, Cooper, Emmel and Miller officiated the AL wild-card game this postseason. \nUmpire Mark Wegner will be the NLCS replay official, with the assistance of Estabrook, in Games 1 and 2 before joining the on-field crew for Game 3, when Drake will serve in the replay capacity. Wegner was a replay official for a wild-card game this postseason. \n---Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal is slated to undergo shoulder surgery next week, according to a report in the Orange County Register. \nGrandal was bothered with significant left shoulder soreness over the second half of the season and batted just .067 over his final 30 regular-season games. \n\"I'm looking forward to not having to deal with this anymore,\" Grandal told the newspaper. \nGrandal had a strong first half and made the National League All-Star team before being hindered by the injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:25:27.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
