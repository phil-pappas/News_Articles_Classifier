Ortiz, USA TODAY Sports CHICAGO - Pitchers with comic-book nicknames brought Chicago Cubs hitters to their knees in the first two games of the National League Championship Series, so perhaps it will hearten them to know Jacob deGrom has no superhero moniker.\nAdChoices Oh, and they’ve actually hit him pretty well.\nChicago’s offense, which burst out for six home runs in a single Division Series game and 10 overall in dispatching the St. Louis Cardinals, eked out a mere three runs total in dropping the first two games of the NLCS to the New York Mets.\nTaking advantage of the chilly conditions at Citi Field, right-handers Matt Harvey, aka The Dark Knight, and Noah Syndergaard – or Thor – gave up a combined seven hits and three runs in 13 1/3 innings while striking out 18, both notching victories.\nWith the series moving to the friendlier and warmer confines of Wrigley Field, the Cubs hope their bats will heat up with the weather, expected to be in the mid-to-high 60s by game time, or a good 25 degrees higher than in New York.\n“The guys will feel their hands a little bit better,’’ manager Joe Maddon said. “It should work out somewhat better for us offensively.’’\nEspecially if deGrom shows up as vulnerable as he was every time he has faced the Cubs. They beat him twice this season, on May 11 and July 2, banging out three home runs and scoring a total of eight runs (seven earned) in 10 1/3 innings for a 6.10 ERA.\nDeGrom wasn’t sharp either the only time he faced Chicago in his Rookie of the Year season in 2014, allowing four runs in five innings.\nNo wonder the hard-throwing right-hander has spent little time dwelling on what went wrong in his starts against the Cubs, preferring to focus his video work on the outings in which he did well so he can replicate those mechanics.\n“I haven't looked back at it too much. I know they weren't very good starts,’’ deGrom said of his performances against Chicago this year, one at home and one at Wrigley. “I'm going to flush that and I know this is the playoffs, so it's going to be a good start for me.’’\nThe current Cubs hitters don’t have an extensive track record facing deGrom, with Starlin Castro and Anthony Rizzo accumulating the most plate appearances, nine each. Castro has gone 2-for-8 with a walk and Rizzo 3-for-9 with a homer.\nWhat stands out most about the collective 52 plate appearances of the current Cubs players against deGrom in his brief career is the seven walks against 11 strikeouts for Chicago hitters, to go along with the three homers.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers will bear witness to the difficulty of achieving that kind of success off him. DeGrom struck out a record-tying 13 Dodgers while giving up just five hits and a walk in seven shutout innings in Game 1 of their Division Series, then came back to beat them again in Game 5 despite having lesser stuff, throwing six innings of two-run ball.\n“It was unbelievable how many times he was one pitch away from coming out of that game and he made the pitch he had to make, and that tells you exactly the kind of kid he is,’’ Mets manager Terry Collins said. “His competition level is, without question, as good as anybody’s.’’\nBut Collins acknowledged deGrom ran into trouble for an extended stretch earlier this season when his pitches didn’t have their usual sink. He allowed 16 home runs in 191 innings this year, a perfectly acceptable figure but not as good as the seven in 140 1/3 he yielded in 2014.\n“One thing we know about the Cubs,’’ Collins said, “they’re going to do some damage on fastballs, I don’t care how hard you throw it.’’\nThey didn’t against Harvey and Syndergaard, high-octane pitchers like deGrom, in large measure because they mixed their heaters with highly effective breaking pitches. DeGrom also resorted to his secondary stuff in the second game against the Dodgers, getting five of his seven strikeouts on pitches other than fastballs.\nDeGrom’s resourcefulness is part of what makes him such a tough challenge, especially for a youthful team that hasn’t seen him much and has a collective batting average of .159 in this series. The Cubs hit 12 homers in their first five playoff games, including two in the wild-card matchup with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but have just one so far in the NLCS.\nMaybe that’s why slugging rookie Kris Bryant, who has a home run and a walk in three plate appearances against deGrom, found more comfort in returning home than in the team’s track record against him.\n“It’s just a completely different ballgame, the playoffs,’’ Bryant said. “I noticed out there, Harvey and Syndergaard pitched us completely different than they did the first times we faced them. They have three pitchers who are really good, but definitely, playing here, that gives us more confidence. DeGrom is a good pitcher and I’m sure he’s going to bring it tomorrow, but I’m confident we’ll come out ready to go.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfCbED.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Saturday", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfAZUR.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfF1LH.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfDCLP.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mets", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Record", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Trouble", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:00:48.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
