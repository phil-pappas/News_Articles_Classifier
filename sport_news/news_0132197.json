The slippery runner stutter-stepped and shook a defender on the edge, cut back inside, juked right to lose another defender, then cut across the field diagonally, outrunning the pursuit. \nThat was a 74-yard punt return touchdown, scored with 10 seconds left in the first half. But it wasn't even Abalos' best work on this evening. \nThat's because he's a quarterback. \nAbalos did his day job quite well, too, throwing four of his five touchdown passes in the first half as the Spackenkill High School football team beat Red Hook, 59-16, in the Spartans' homecoming game. \nThe quarterback, in his do-it-all role, also rushed for 138 yards. \nSpackenkill, completing a near-perfect turnaround from last year's one-win campaign, showed its might once more in dominating a Section 9 rival. \nMarlon Brooks caught three touchdowns and snagged two interceptions, Dhyquem Lewinson ran for 157 yards and two touchdowns for the Spartans (5-1). Defensive tackle Kyiev Bennermon had three tackles for loss. \nAbalos' dazzling punt return score gave the Spartans a 38-14 lead (and sent the home crowd into a tizzy). But before that, there were these: \nHis 86-yard touchdown pass to Joe Arcuri in the first quarter, which answered a Red Hook (2-4) score emphatically. On a third-and-25, Abalos rolled right and floated a deep ball to Arcuri on a go route up the right sideline. The receiver separated, made the catch and outran the pursuit to the end zone. \nAnd then... Abalos found Alex Strom in the right corner of the end zone for a sliding catch to take a 12-6 lead with 2:57 remaining in the opening quarter. \nAnd then... Spackenkill, bold as they were, recovered an onside kick and put Abalos right back to work. The quarterback then hit Marlon Brooks for a 10-yard touchdown with 32 seconds left in the quarter. \nAnd then... After the Raiders pulled within 18-14 on Nick Morrissey's 72-yard touchdown to Nick Michitsch and the subsequent two-point conversion, pass. Yep, you guessed it. Abalos threw a 12-yard touchdown to Arcuri. \nThe Spartans got so pass-happy, even teammates got in on the act. On a fourth-and-14, the Spartans faked an end-around and pitched the ball to Arcuri, who tossed a 36-yard touchdown to a wide open Brooks.
