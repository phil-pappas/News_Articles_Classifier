Wilson completed 26-of-36 passes for 297 yards and two touchdowns on the night, hooking up with nine different receivers. The Sun Devils blitzed on what seemed like every down, trying to contain Devontae Booker and put the game on Wilson's shoulders. He responded in a big way with his best game of the season.\nArizona State was keen on stopping Utah's rushing attack, and limited Booker to 21 carries for 118 yards and two touchdowns. Booker was clutch in the fourth quarter, scoring both his touchdowns and helping the Utes outscore ASU 20-0 in the final period. Without his magical play in the final period, Booker had just 31 yards on 19 carries and zero touchdowns.\nGrade: B+ \nDefense \nAs it has been all season long, the Utah defense was absolutely fantastic. The Utes forced two turnovers — both in the fourth quarter — on their way to allowing just nine points and 257 yards of total offense.\nThere's not much else to say about this Utah defense except that it is, indeed, legit.\nGrade: A+ \nSpecial teams \nWell ... this was one those nights where you would like to just forget you played special teams. That is unless your name is Andy Phillips or Tom Hackett.\nNine of ASU's 18 points were allowed by the Utah special teams. After leading 7-0, Utah kicked off to ASU return man Tim White. White went right to the sideline and went 100 yards untouched to tie the game 7-7. The coverage was poor to say the least, but unfortunately for Utah, it wasn't over.\nLater, White stood back to receive a punt. He took it 48 yards and would have scored if Hackett wouldn't have made a touchdown-saving tackle.\nIn the third quarter, leading 14-13, Utah's Britain Covey received the kickoff nine yards deep in his own end zone. He then took off but stopped as if to take a knee before throwing an illegal forward pass to his left that resulted in a safety, giving the Sun Devils a 15-14 lead and the football.\nIt wasn't all bad for the Utes special teams, though. Phillips was 4-for-4 on field goal attempts, and Hackett punted eight times, landing five of them inside the 20.\nGrade: C- \nOverall review \nAfter trailing 18-14, Utah outscored Arizona State 20-0 in the fourth quarter on its way to a 34-18 win. The defense was outstanding, the offense looked not so one dimensional and the special teams were disappointing.\nBut a win is a win. And Kyle Wittingham will take it any way he can. Utah sits at 6-0 overall and 3-0 in the Pac-12 heading into a clash with the USC Trojans next week.\nGrade: A- \nCJ Pronk is a Deseret Digital Media contributor and a Stansbury High School graduate.
