K-State hosts West Virginia on Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. from Bramlage Coliseum. \nKersten Kober walked into her team film session on Monday like it was any other day. \nThe junior libero and her teammates had just returned home after a rally bid fell just short in their 3-2 loss at TCU. \nWhile the Wildcats did lose down in Fort Worth, Texas, Kober’s performance could not have been much better. She registered 37 digs, which is the third-best in a match in K-State program history and the best performance in a away match since 1987. \nThe performance also gave Kober the top spot in the Big 12 for digs in a single match. \nKober and the Wildcats return home on Saturday to take on West Virginia (5-11, 0-3 Big 12) in Bramlage Coliseum with hopes of stopping a two-match losing skid. \nTip is scheduled for 2 p.m. \nWhen Kober went into practice on Friday, she was made aware that the Big 12 had named her its Defensive Player of the Week, her first weekly honor. \n“It was really exciting,” Kober said. “I honestly didn’t know until right before practice. So I kind of walked right in and (assistant coach) Jeff Grove was like ‘Hey, congratulations!’ And I had no idea what he was talking about.” \nKober is the fifth libero from K-State to be awarded defensive player of the week since the start of the weekly award in 2007. \n“I think she digs a lot of balls so it makes sense,” head coach Suzie Fritz said. “I think the effort level for her is extraordinary when it comes to digging. She really takes pride in making a tremendous effort.” \nKober comes to Manhattan out of Southlake, Texas, and the heralded Southlake Carroll High where she played varsity in all four of her high school seasons. \nKober has several other former high school teammates competing at the Division-I level across the country — including OU freshman outside hitter Madison Drescher, who is the reigning Big 12 co-rookie of the week. \nIn addition to playing for the Eagles, Kober also competed on club teams where she was coached by current K-State assistant Trent Sorensen. \nIt was with Sorensen’s encouragement that Kober was sold on becoming a Wildcat. \n“So going into my senior year I didn’t really know where I was going,” Kober said. “Suzie came down to a camp down at my club and that’s where I met her. I kind of showed some interest and (assistant coach) Trent Sorensen was the one who kind of encouraged me to pursue it. He said that I’d love it and I’d love the coaches and that it would be a great opportunity for me. I came up for camp and I just fell in love with the team and I fell in love with the coaching staff. I came on campus and I just felt connected immediately.” \nAnd when the news came out of her award on Monday, Sorensen’s pride for his former and current player came out. \n“I’m just excited for her,” Sorensen said. “It’s well deserving. No one deserves it more than Kober. She works so hard at what she does and she sacrifices so much. And probably, the best part about it is she might have already forgotten that she got it. She’s all about team, for sure.” \nSorensen said that Kober has matured so much since she was 15 on a Texas club volleyball team, especially in her ability to slow the game down. \nBut, even with the progression of her game in her first three years of college, Sorensen remarked that Kober’s fire to get better has always been apparent to him. \n“She’s kinda always been the workhorse,” Sorensen said. “The mature, workhorse, steady-eddie kind of kid.” \nAnd even in the wake of the top of moment of her college career, Kober is still working and striving to improve as a player. \n“I think you can always be better,” Kober said. “I think you can always work harder, you can always better the ball and perform better. It’s just focusing on the small things.” \nThat work ethic and passion has spilled over into her life off the court. So much so that Sorensen hopes that his kids, Kober babysits for on occasion, might find her as a role model. \n“She’s not my child but it’s been nice to see her for this long,” Sorensen said. “I’m going to give high praise here, but I would love for my daughters to become like her. She’s been that kind of person for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:15:55.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
