(AP Photo/Daniel Ochoa de Olza) \nMADRID (AP) — Real Madrid’s injuries keep piling up after Gareth Bale injured a muscle in his left leg two days before the Spanish side’s match at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. \nThe 10-time European champions say Bale’s availability for Wednesday’s match will depend on the speed of his recovery. \nBale was substituted at halftime of Saturday’s 3-0 win over Levante that lifted Madrid to the top of the Spanish league table. \nMadrid may get Luka Modric back from injury after the midfielder returned to training on Monday. \nKarim Benzema, Sergio Ramos and Pepe are also doubtful, while James Rodriguez and Dani Carvajal have been ruled out due to injury. \nMadrid and PSG share the Group A lead with six points each.
