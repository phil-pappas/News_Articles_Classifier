Trent Rosecrans , crosecrans@enquirer.com 5:39 p.m. EDT October 15, 2015 Cincinnati native Preston Brown plays middle linebacker for the Buffalo Bills. (Photo: Jim Brown, Jim Brown-USA TODAY Sports) \nA 6-year-old Preston Brown had no idea what he was looking at or looking for, but there on the Brown family’s TV was his football game, shot by his mother and reviewed by his father. \nBrown, a Northwest High School graduate who is now the starting middle linebacker for the Bills, was hoping to see some highlights of his runs, like his own mini SportsCenter. His father, however, wanted to see more. \nA high school coach, Mike Brown didn’t get to see all of young Preston’s games live, so he was able to see the games on tape and talk to his son about everything that was happening on the field and why. \n“The main thing has always been feet — I’d exaggerated a little bit and said that’s why they call it football, because it starts with your feet and what do your feet do?” the elder Brown told The Enquirer this week. ”Even when he was blocking, if your feet keep moving after you make contact with the guy, you go through the block, and you’ll end up on top of the guy. If you’re tackling someone and you keep your feet moving and they stop their feet, you’ll end up on top of them. You have to go through the block or through the tackle. That was the main thing. You can show where his feet stop or when he’d end up.” Bengals' Film Session: Facing the Bills \nBut more than any technique, what the early film sessions taught the young Brown was that football didn’t stop on field, it was more than just practice and games, there was always more you could learn. \n“When he did finally get to high school, watching film was something he was really good at,” said Mike Brown. “He’d watch with me, if I was coaching at Withrow or Woodward or something, he’d watch our film and see what I saw. It was funny, that by the time he was a sophomore in high school, he’d see stuff I wouldn’t see. When I’d go back to practice, I said, ‘my son saw this, and this is what we’ll do.’ It grew. It’s to the point now where it’s great when he’ll show me things and teach me things about the game, whether it’s terminology or technique.” \nAnd it continues to this day. Mike Brown will watch Bills games from the NFL League Pass and talk to his son about what he sees. \n“He’ll go back home and rewind it and send me stuff that he saw,” Preston Brown said. “He doesn’t know the plays, so he’ll just send me things he thought he saw going on.” First look: Bengals vs. Bills \nMore than that, it’s a way a family to grow together. Not only did Mike and Preston share football, so too did ace videographer and mother Patrice and older sister Paige. \nThe Brown family will lead a caravan to Buffalo this weekend to see their son play. Approximately 25 friends and family will make the drive to western New York this weekend. \n“We just told everybody they couldn’t wear their Bengals gear,” Mike Brown said. “You’re going to have to be neutral. It’s hard for me because the Bengals are my second-favorite team now. It’s difficult because we have Bengals stuff all over our house.” \nNext week, a smaller contingent of the Brown family will go to London to watch Brown and the Bills play the Jaguars in London. \nThe Browns will be watching one of the league’s best young linebackers. Brown’s 41 tackles on the season is 10th in the NFL and he was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week after recording two interceptions — and returning one for a touchdown — in the team’s Sept. 27 victory over the Dolphins. Last season his 108 tackles were the second-most by any rookie. Walkthru: Bengals not 'smelling' themselves \n“When we first came here, he played a lot of Sam linebacker last year and they also played him at middle, but really we thought he’s a good player,” first-year Bills head coach Rex Ryan said this week. “He’s much better than that. He’s not just a good player, he has a chance to be an outstanding middle linebacker in this league. His dad was a coach and it shows. He’s a smart player, he’s physical and he’s done a really nice job here.” \nEven before he took the field, he earned a spot in general manager Doug Whaley’s office decor. After being drafted in the third round out of Louisville last year, Brown wrote Whaley a thank you note. That note now hangs in Whaley’s office. \n“They were giving him an opportunity to live out his dream,” Mike Brown said. “A lot of the credit goes out to my wife, who is one of his agents, and his other agent, Brian Hamilton. That’s just kind of what they do. It’s not just my son. They tell everyone to do that, and everyone doesn’t, I’m sure. It meant a lot to my son, so it was easy for them to do.” \nAnd now, it is the Bills who are thankful to have Brown. 973 CONNECT 40 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1RKODpm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:36:37.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
