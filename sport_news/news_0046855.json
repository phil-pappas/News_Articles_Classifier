The Browns fell to 1-3, and they will now begin preparations for next Sunday's game at Baltimore.\nAfter Sunday's loss, Browns coach Mike Pettine met with reporters. Here highlights of his comments:\nOn the defeat\n\"Clearly a frustrating finish. The guys were out there battling at the end. . . I'm proud of them. We made too many mistakes, penalties, missed assignments here and there. . . You can't do that against a quality quarterback like that. . . It's a loss. We're 1-3. We own that. We're going to do what we know best how to do: Bunker in and get back to football.\"\nTramon Williams' offside that gave San Diego another FG attempt\n\"That's when you're in a desperation block situation. . and you're just trying to time it up the best that you can.\"\nBrowns' defensive struggles\n\"They hit us on some crossers (crossing routes).. . . They made some good plays. We had some issues with some of the crossers stuff. Frustrating. But the guys who were in there. Baddy (Johnson Bademosi) did a good job. Justin (Gilbert), the reps he was in there. (Pierre) Desir. .. Those guys battled until the end.\"\nWhy cornerback Joe Haden didn't play\n\"Joe had broken his finger last week and had practiced with it during the week, and I don't think it lessened to where he could go. He came out and tested and decided he couldn't go, so we adjusted.\"\nOn whether injuries made it tough\n\"That's the NFL. We're in the no-excuse business. It's next-man-up mentality, and everybody else has to elevate their play, too. You have depth on the roster. That's what it's there for.\"\nOn whether Josh McCown played well\n\"He did. I thought he hung in there. There were a couple of times early that he took some throws down the field that he didn't need to. He wanted to be aggressive. He saw the field well and moved around the pocket. . took some hits. . . I thought it was a solid performance by him.\"\nWhether he will say anything to Williams about being offside\n\"What do you say to him? I don't say anything. Here's a guy who played his tail off for 60 minutes. . . tried to make a play at the end and was a shade off. I'm not going to say anything to him other than, 'Thanks for your effort.' \"\nOn the Browns defense having two sacks\n\"A lot of the stuff was the shallow crossers. . . Anytime the quarterback is on that internal clock where he's going to deliberately get it out earlier, it's going to be difficult to get to him.\"\nWhat changes they can make on defense\n\"We need to assess those drives in crunch time. . . In previous games we've given them up, and that's certainly something we'll have to evaluate.\"\nDuke Johnson's versatility\n\"Anytime you have a back who can be a first- and second-down back in between the tackles, and then have him split out wide, that puts a lot of stress on a defense. . . That's a pretty good indication of how we'll use him.\"\nOn his decision to challenge the Barnidge catch\n\"They (Browns assistant coaches) were adamant up top that it was a catch, so that was an easy challenge.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T03:22:17.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
