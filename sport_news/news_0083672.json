LITCHFIELD â€“ If football games were determined buy time of possession - Litchfield would be have picked up victory No. 1 of the season on Friday night at the Terrier's Homecoming Game. Unfortunately, the outcome of football games are determined by who scores more points - and Michigan Lutheran using big plays - including scoring three touchdowns on just five plays in the first quarter - defeated Litchfield 50-12. \"That was our goal. We wanted to keep control of the ball and run the clock,\" Litchfield head coach Dale Smith said, \"and we finally put one in there - in the end zone. Down 44-0 at 9:29 of the third quarter, and facing the continuous running clock, the Terriers broke the scoring ice when Noah Smith scooped the Michigan Lutheran kick-off following aTitan score - broke through the line and covered 76 yards for a touchdown at the 9:16 mark. \"Noah is a sophomore, but he's probably the quickest guy we've got out on the team,\" Smith said.\"He's had a couple of returns where he almost broke one and got some good seal-blocks. The guys up front there really did a good job and he found a seem, and once he gets by someone, I don't think anyones going to catch him.\" Michigan Lutheran would answer, and lead 50-6 at 6:02 of the third quarter. But the Terriers did not give up. \"That's one of the good things about their team. They are always positive.\" Smith said. \"They always keep an upbeat attitude. Always keep fighting.\" Taking the ensuing kick-off, and riding the rushes of Kody Cares, Litchfield went 76 yards in nine plays and scored again with Smith doing the honors from two yards out, at 11:56 of the fourth quarter. \"We played well in the second-half, and we were able to pop one in and the boys are really happy about that,\" Smith said. \"Cody cares ran the ball really hard for us tonight,\" Smith added. \"He was patient and watched the holes open up and he hit the holes, and did a job for us. That's why the (quarterback) bootleg worked so well, Kody's hard running.\" The Terriers put together one solid drive in the second quarter that reached the Michigan Lutheran five-yard line, before it stalled, and another in the fourth quarter, that reached the Titans 15 before giving up the ball on downs. \"But that's a lot of the problems we've had this year,\" Smith said. \"We get down inside the 10 yard line, make some mistakes and kill ourselves. That's what we did again today.\" Michigan Lutheran led 22-0 after one quarter, 30-0 by halftime and 50-6 after three quarters. The loss drops Litchfield to 0-3 in the Southern Michigan 8-Man Football League, and 0-7 overall. Page 2 of 2 - It was Michigan Lutheran's first win in league play after an 0-3 start. The Titans are 1-6 overall. Michigan Lutheran is 0-4 in the Southern Michigan 8-Man Football League and 0-7 overall. It's 'out of the frying' pan and into the fire' for Litchfield as the Terriers travel to Waldron to meet the undefeated Spartans. Six-and-oh on the season, Waldron plays state-ranked and undefeated St. Philip today at 1:30 p.m. in Battle Creek. Lietchfield hosted Waldron in the Terriers season-opener, losing to the Spartans, 50-0.
