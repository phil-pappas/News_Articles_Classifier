I've got a little speed, vision and a little power that I bring to the table.\" \nAnother way to describe Ettine is productive. The running back currently leads all of SWLA with 1,492 yards rushing and 25 touchdowns. Last week vs Iota he had another dominating performance, running for 260 yards an five touchdowns. \n\"I've just been running the ball-- that's my job. Everybody on the team has one job. We just do the job to the best of our ability. I have linemen open up holes for me, so I just run behind them. They deserve all the credit.\" \nDespite only four games remaining in the regular season, the Bulldog back still has a few personal goals to accomplish. \n\"Coming into the year, I wanted to get over 2,000 yards. Of course my goal every year is to win a championship. Once we get together and get going and click, we're going to be tough to beat.\" Can't Find Something?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:17:11.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
