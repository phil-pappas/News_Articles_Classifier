The Sacramento Kings’ guard could play the media game, put on a fake smile and try to charm his way to some positive coverage.\nBut that’s not Rondo’s style. He is not about to try to use the media to change the opinions of those who have already crafted one of him.\n“I don’t read papers, I don’t read articles, so it doesn’t make a difference,” the 29-year-old Rondo said. “People will believe anything they read, and that’s just the way the world is.”\nRondo, who ended last season with the Dallas Mavericks, was involved in controversy last week when he gave a deadpan, joking answer about his relationship with Kings coach George Karl.\nMost Read Stories Pair split; now can she divorce nickname? 12 reasons why living in Washington is better than living in Oregon Will 787 program ever show an overall profit?

Everybody has an opinion. \n“My family and people that are close to me, my teammates know what kind of teammate I am and that’s what it’s all about. That’s all that matters to me.”\nRondo said negativity will always receive more attention than upbeat material.\n“People love to thrive on bad news,” he said. “I’ve had a couple of bad press reports, and that’s how people labeled me.”\n• Cleveland forward Kevin Love had six points and four rebounds in his first game since a season-ending shoulder injury in the opening round of last season’s playoffs, but the Cavaliers remained winless in the exhibition season with an 87-81 loss to the host Toronto Raptors.\nSuperstar LeBron James didn’t play for Cleveland (0-6).\nLove didn’t have to wait long to feel some contact during the game.\n“First play, actually,” he said. “That was a good thing and a bad thing. It’s been tested a number of times in practice; I keep working on the strength. I’m sure there’ll be a few scares here and there, but that’s kind of mentally just getting over the hump a little bit. I feel great.”\nTennis Djokovic wins 9th title of year Top-ranked Novak Djokovic of Serbia defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-2, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters final in China.\nDjokovic earned his ninth title of the season, a week after he triumphed at the China Open in Beijing for the sixth time in six appearances.\nHe didn’t drop a set at either tournament and extended his winning streak to 17 matches, dating to his championship run at the U.S. Open in New York. He surpassed $16 million in prize money, a record for a season.\n“I don’t want to get carried away by success,” Djokovic said, “because I want to be playing on this level for many more years to come.”\n• Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland defeated Danka Kovinic of Montenegro 6-1, 6-2 to win the Tianjin Open title in China and clinch a spot in the WTA Finals in Singapore.
