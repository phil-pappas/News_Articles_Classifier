That was early in the game so it could have gave us a little momentum and some breathing room, but their goaltender played well.”\nIce chips \nThe goal by Carolina’s Victor Rask in the second period ended a stretch of 95:12 the Red Wings hadn’t allowed a goal.\n… Blashill used the same lineup Saturday as he did the night before, apart from Mrazek replacing Howard.\n… In its season-opening loss Thursday, Carolins lost defenseman James Wisniewski (Canton) with a torn ACL which will force him to miss six months..\n… Dylan Larkin and Carolina defenseman Noah Hanifin were teammates on the USA world junior team.\n… The Hurricanes television network was identifying assistant coach Pat Ferschweiler as Blashill for much of the first period until finally getting it right.\nted.kulfan@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tkulfan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:22:03.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
