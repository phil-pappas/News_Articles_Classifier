Butcher said the parties \"mutually agreed this might be a good time for change.\" \nBaylor, who won an MVP with the Angels in 1979, had been the team's hitting coach since 2014. Twice a big league manager, he's been coaching in the majors for 23 seasons. The Angels finished last in the AL with a .246 batting average and 12th with 661 runs scored this season. \nThe Angels went 85-77 and missed the playoffs by one game. Manager Mike Scioscia is expected to return. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:21:48.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
