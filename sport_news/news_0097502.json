Tuaua and Petties-Wilson played against the Golden Gophers but missed the past three games. \nCoach Gary Patterson said the players had \"gone through the judicial process,\" although a Fort Worth police spokesman said the case hasn't been forwarded to Tarrant County prosecutors. \nTuaua played all 12 games with five starts last season. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:04:28.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
