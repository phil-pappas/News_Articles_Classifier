Now heading into this year there's another first, a very different looking locker room for Richardson to head up. \nThere are a few familiar faces for Binghamton heading into the 2015-16 season, but fans are going to see a lot of new faces playing key roles this year. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nThat includes that of Mark Fraser. \nHe's played part of seven seasons in the NHL, but after being let out of his tryout contract with Toronto this preseason, he was signed by Ottawa. That is a move that adds some real veteran leadership to the B-Sens. \n\"A lot of leadership qualities, he's a big, strong, physical guy, kind of a Mark Borowiecki style guy that is even bigger,\" said Richardson. \"He's a confident guy, very smart, intelligent person. So you put all those together and we were ecstatic to get him.\" \n\"It's a chance to just help the team with some success, but try to bring some leadership for some of the young guys as well,\" said Fraser on Wednesday. \"Just be a good teammate and lead by example both on and off the ice. There's a lot of growing pains that guys are going to face with their first few years in the minors and just try to be a good veteran presence.\" \nFraser is just one of many new faces for Binghamton. Ten of the 23 skaters on the current roster are new to the B-Sens, but the team feels like it's coming together quickly. \n\" It seems like we have a great group so far,\" said Max McCormick. \"I mean, in a hockey locker room guys get close quickly and they become your friends right away. I think we have a good group so far.\" \nWith all the new pieces, Richardson said on Wednesday he's not ready to name a captain yet. \nThe B-Sens open up the season on Saturday at home against Albany. Richardson said that Chris Driedger is expected to get the start in goal in that one. \nPuempel returns to B-Sens A familiar face was assigned back to Binghamton on Wednesday afternoon. \nForward Matt Puempel was re-assigned back to the B-Sens from Ottawa.
