The two finalists qualify for the CIS Championship, Nov. 5-8 in Kingston, Ont., where they will join representatives from the OUA, RSEQ, and AUS conferences. \n“I think some of the teams in the other conferences get false senses of security,” Parrish continued, “because they’re coming to the national championships and suddenly, ‘Whoa, teams actually tackle us,’ so I’ve always said that’s been the nice thing about coming out of Canada West.” \nCanada West rugby is as competitive as the long-serving Parrish can remember, thanks in large part to the improvement of its B.C.-based teams. In the 2013 regular season, five matches were decided by a margin of 39 or more points. Only two games were decided by more than 20 points last year, and this season the largest margin of victory was 26. \nVictoria gave Alberta everything it could handle in the teams’ regular season meeting, last weekend on Vancouver Island, where the Pandas held on to win 34-28. \n“We used to be able to go to B.C. and just steamroll them in the forwards,” said Parrish. “We’ve always had what I call Alberta beef and if you dominate the forwards it’s really tough, but now they’ve bulked up and become a bit tougher in that department. \n“We’ve still got a little bit of that, we probably had more dominance in that game (last weekend), so I just say to my players, if we can keep exploiting that we can make this easier for ourselves to win.” \nWith the CIS championship expanding this year to eight from six teams, the Canada West championship takes on a decidedly different look. Previously, only the gold-medal winning team was granted a berth in nationals. Now a semi-final victory is all that’s needed to advance. \n“It changes the way I look at selections, because in previous years I’ve maybe thought of it as, ‘I know I’ve got to win the final to get there’, so if a certain player was slightly injured I could rest them … and take my chances on weaker opposition in the semifinal,” said Parrish. \n“But not this year. I’m going to be putting out my best squad to make sure we get through (the semifinal).” \nAlberta has won the conference title 10 times since 1999. \n@SunBrianSwane U of A TEAMS THIS WEEKEND \nPANDAS RUGBY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:40:07.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
