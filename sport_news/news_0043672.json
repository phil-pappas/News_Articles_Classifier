(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones shares his thoughts on the UK basketball team's upcoming season. \nBig Blue Madness is Friday night, and because of the UK Auburn game Thursday, and other factors, it just doesn't seem to be as big a deal as it is in most years. \nThroughout Lexington, I've noticed fans are just not talking about Big Blue Madness like they used to. \nNow part of that of course, is as Ryan Lemond told you last week, part of it is because of football. \nKentucky's been playing so well, that's been on people's minds. But I do think part of it is the holdover from the game against Wisconsin last year. \nThe Cats fans are excited about any season, but we still remember how painful that loss was. But I'm here to tell fans, get over it. It's now time to move on to the new year. \nThis is going to be a heck of a team. Jamal Murray, Skal Labissiere, Charles Matthews and Isaiah Briscoe, are great newcomers, and Tyler Ulis and Alex Poythress return as being two of the best returning players in the country. I know it's tough. \nLast year, the Wisconsin loss gutted us all. But now it's time to focus on the new team. This is going to be a fun team. They're gonna play fast, they're gonna get up and down the court, and they're gonna win a big share of games. \nSo get behind them, it starts tomorrow with Big Blue Madness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:00:48.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
