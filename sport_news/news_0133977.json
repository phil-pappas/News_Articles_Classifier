Her rival in the final was twice her age and a former World champion too.\nArantxa had won the IBSF World team snooker title in 2013 with Vidya Pillai in Ireland. Pune-based Arantxa, India No. 1 in billiards, had bagged the Shiv Chhatrapati award recently. Her joy was doubled with the World title. She has grabbed her two World titles in the inaugural editions of the championships. \"I feel on top of the world right now,\" said Arantxa from Adelaide. \"This is my second title and I'm looking forward to winning more. I was confident of winning as I had a good run in the semifinals against Meenal Thakur and I was posting consistent, decent breaks throughout.\"\nHaving to cope with her hectic work schedule at Credit Suisse, where she is a Product Controller in the finance section, Arantxa finds little time to practice her sport.\n\"I started to practice three weeks before the tournament,\" said Arantxa who guides her own self besides her father Col Esmond who mentors her. \"Just 10 days before the tournament I took a few tips and advice from Dhruv Sitwala, after returning from Pakistan,\" she said.\nArantxa had lost in the quarterfinals of the World Six-Red snooker championship in Karachi in August this year to eventual champion Ng On Yee of Hong Kong.\nBesides finding time to practice regularly, Arantxa has to tackle an eye ailment. She suffers from Keratoconus in both eyes, a progressive disease which blurs the vision. \"I have to undergo a surgery to rectify this but I have been putting it off till now as I am not mentally prepared to do it right now. Maybe later,\" said Arantxa, whose master eye (right eye) is more affected by this condition.\n\"I find it difficult to spot the ball and also I tend to aim towards the right of the pocket instead of the centre. Playing the two-hour final was indeed strenuous and I wasn't getting enough sleep too,\" she said.\nDespite having represented the country nine times at international tournaments, sponsors have been lacking and some financial aid to cover her travel expenses can boost her game even more, said Arantxa. Her prize fund was $800 for winning in Adelaide with additional $50 as the break prize.\nNext up for her is the IBSF World Snooker tournament to be held in Egypt in November.\n\"I am much motivated now. I haven't been playing much of snooker but now I intend to bag the snooker World title as well,\" said Arantxa, ranked India No. 3 in snooker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:13:34.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
