He didn’t make excuses. He talked about how his team had been overconfident, how it had yet again cost itself with bad penalties. \nNo more, he said. \nIt was here, in one of the Edmonton Oil Kings’ most trying moments, that Brandon Baddock looked more than ever like its leader. \nThe Oil Kings are desperate to turn things around on Monday when they host the Kootenay Ice in what will be the 200th game of their captain’s WHL career. \nA fourth-liner who was known mostly for his fists during the Oil Kings latter championship years, Baddock is now the multifaceted heart and soul of an Edmonton team in the midst of a sometimes painful transition into its next era. \n“He was very quiet and understated when he first got here early in his career,” Oil Kings coach Steve Hamilton said. “You could see always he had a good sense of humour and was comfortable around the guys, but his evolution as a leader really happened over the course of time that he spent here. He played with some real good guys and learned from them and he puts his own twist on that into his captaincy.” \nA six-foot-four, 225-pounder mountain of a man, Baddock was named Oil Kings captain by Hamilton last month, succeeding Ashton Sautner. The 20-year-old has two goals and two assists this season for Edmonton, who have won just three times through 12 games and lost 4-3 to Lethbridge on Saturday after taking a 3-1 lead into the third period. \n“I know he’s got the message that we’re trying to send, I know we’ve always got his full support in the room and that’s what you want from your captain,” Hamilton said. “We’re a tight group here and I know that the guys really respect Brandon a lot. Things will get better wins-and-losseswise, but I certainly feel like our process here has been really good and he’s led the way.” \nThere have been only 12 players that suited up at least 200 times for the Oil Kings in their modern history. It’s a list so exclusive that full-time NHLers (Curtis Lazar), NHL first-round draft picks (Henrik Samuelsson) and former Edmonton captains (Brenden Dowd) aren’t part of it. \n“Obviously this is a very competitive league, and to play 200 games has really developed me as a player,” said Baddock, who is in his fourth full season with the Oil Kings. “I’m fortunate to have spent all of them here in Edmonton.” \nOn Sept. 25, he was named the Oil Kings’ ninth captain. \n“He was always a real honest player, a real honest practice guy,” said Hamilton. “He didn’t get a whole lot of opportunity in his early days here, it just was the nature of our club at the time. I respect the way he handled that and he was able to continue to take strides in his own game in a tough spot at times. That spoke to his character and is a big reason why he’s our captain now.” \nMonday isn’t about Game Number 200 for Baddock. The only number that matters is seven – which is what Edmonton’s winless streak will reach if it can’t beat Kootenay. \n“We play a full sixty minute period, we play hard, we finish our checks we follow the game plan like we did for the first 40 (minutes against Lethbridge) and we’ll get success,” he said. “We can’t let the emotions get the best of us.” \n‘Welcome to the WHL’ \nVermilion native Brandon Baddock played his final years of minor hockey In Lloydminster and was selected 134th overall (seventh round) by Edmonton in the 2010 WHL Draft. He was with the Lloydminster Bobcats in the Alberta Junior Hockey League in the fall 2011 when he was called up for one game by the Oil Kings. \n“Getting out there on my first shift I got the puck along the wall and got absolutely crushed. It was kind of a ‘Welcome to the WHL’ moment for me,” Baddock recalled. “After that I picked it up and finished the game off.” \n‘Bads,’ as his teammates call him, scored on his first shift of his first game at Rexall Place, taking a pass from Keegan Lowe, coming down the wall and beating Kootenay goalie Mackenzie Skapski far side in Edmonton’s 2012-13 season-opener. \nOffence was not his M.O., however. In his first two seasons, Baddock totalled 13 goals while racking up 201 penalty minutes. He scored just once on Edmonton’s playoff run to the 2014 Memorial Cup. \nBaddock was a surprise pick, 161st overall by New Jersey, in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.
