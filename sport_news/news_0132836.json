(Doug Pensinger/Getty Images/AFP Report an error \nCanadians live in Igloos and frequently say, “eh, bud,” too. \nAnd, according to Fox Sports analyst and former major leaguer Harold Reynolds, Canadians also don't play a lot of baseball. \nIn fact, they're so unfamiliar with the sport the idea of catching a foul ball is foreign to them. \nDuring Sunday night's Game 3 of the American League division series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers, Reynolds, 54, took a subtle shot at those living north of the border. At least that's what it felt like. \n“We were talking about foul balls in the stands up in Toronto,” said Reynolds, who was part of the broadcast team for the first two games of the series last week at Rogers Centre. “Because there's not a lot of people who grew up playing baseball in Canada they're not used to catching a lot of balls in the stands.” \nThat remark, unsurprisingly, drew the ire of already-on-edge Jays fans across Canada. \nBefore long, #HaroldReynolds was trending on social media in certain portions of Canada. \nIt also prompted some prominent players to weigh in on Reynolds' Canadian diss. \nToronto City Councillor Mark Grimes – likely jokingly – tweeted Reynolds was no longer welcome in Toronto. \nReynolds' Wikipedia page was updated -- in an effort to mock him -- to say he's currently making an effort to teach every Canadian to \"catch a ball.\" \nThe Toronto Sun's Steve Buffery spoke with Blue Jays centrefielder Dalton Pompey, a Canadian, after the Jays extended the series. \n“He should know better,” Pompey told Buffery when asked about Reynolds’ comments. “A lot of guys who played on this team this year are from Canada; me, Russell Martin, Michael Saunders, Jeff Francis, Andrew Albers. \n\"He knows that. Baseball is growing in Canada and I think we’ll start to see more guys playing in the big leagues sooner rather than later. But he should know that.” \nDid you find Reynolds' comments offensive?
