Therefore, proceed with cautious confidence as you ponder Mr. Aitch’s Week 6 offerings.\nJets over Redskins: Hondo isn’t sold on Fitzpatrick, but Kirk Cousins doesn’t inspire a reach for the wallet, either — not against the league’s No. 1 defense. Don’t expect Team Toilet Paper to crack as it rolls to 4-1 heading into its big-ass game with the Patriots.\nBrowns over Broncos: Fadin’ Peyton Manning is averaging almost 38 passes a game, which has him on pace to set the single-season record for most wounded ducks.\nBengals over Bills: The media seem to be in universal agreement that Hillary Clinton wiped the floor with her weak debate competition like she wiped her server (or so it was originally thought). In fact, ABC Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos is so excited about Hillary’s performance, word is he is ready to send the Clinton Global Initiative another $75,000.\nSpeaking of chiefs, according to emailer BarkingMut, the HondoNation SoBe Bureau Chief: “The only other Bernie besides Sanders whose goal was to take as much money as possible out of the pockets of those who earned it fairly is named Madoff.”\nVikings over Chiefs: Governor Cuomo and Al Gore gave speeches on climate change recently at Columbia U. and reportedly made some state workers attend in order to fill out the auditorium. Some people are outraged because the workers were on the taxpayer’s dime, but it goes beyond that. Being forced to listen to those two drone on about what New York is doing to reduce greenhouse gasses is a clear a violation of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.\nJaguars over Texans: Stuyvesant High School received a No. 11 ranking by U.S. News and World Report in its recent NYC rankings. That seems a little low considering it not only offers 28 advanced placement courses and 200 student clubs but also is the only school in the city to allow students to tart up for Slutty Wednesday.\nLions over Bears: Rick Pitino, discussing the alleged sex scandal involving a madam supplying players with prostitutes to Louisville players, said this week the Cards “will get through this the right way.” In other words, he’s not going to take it lying down, unless he can find a willing partner to share a tabletop with at an Italian restaurant.\nFormer Post colleague-turned harness racing impresario Frank Drucker says next year at Louisville, Midnight Madness will be known as Midnight Madam.\nCardinals over Steelers: The officials in the Steelers-Chargers game inadvertently let 18 seconds run off the clock late in the fourth quarter, a gaffe that could have cost Pittsburgh the victory. That comes on the heels of the blown call in Week 4 that prevented a possible Lions win in Seattle. So the officiating is a mess, but at least fans can be thankful the work on Roger Goodell’s appeal of the Deflategate ruling is said to be going smoothly.\nDolphins over Titans: It’s the New Coach Theory, which holds that all the slackers who were responsible for getting the old coach fired want to show the new coach they deserve their jobs, so they play hard for a game or two.\nPanthers over Seahawks: Making a movie about Dan Rather’s false report concerning George Bush’s National Guard career and calling it “Truth,” is like making a movie about Barack Obama’s tenure as President and calling it “Competence.”\nPackers over Chargers: Emauler Ed Buckmir on Steve “Cutty Sark” Sarkisian: There are allegations the now deposed USC coach was intoxicated on the sidelines of a recent game, which became evident when he kept taking shots downfield … Until recently there were two elements to Southern Cal football that you could count on: The defense blitzed frequently and the coach was frequently blitzed.\n49ers over Ravens: The 49ers reportedly are ready to air it out … wait, check that, the actual report is that coach Jim Tomsula aired it out again at his weekly press conference with another trouser tremor.\nPatriots over Colts: Tom Brady has to be pumped to prove to the Colts he can put a whuppin’ on them with his balls fully inflated for 60 minutes.\nAfter the Cowboys were thoroughly thrashed by the Pats on Sunday, Tony Romo told Brady: “See you in February.” Thus, if anybody has a spare ticket to SB 50, Romo probably would pay top dollar for it.\nEagles over Giants: Eli is getting showered with props for the Giants’ turnaround, even though the reversal became necessary partly because of his poor play. Not only that, but if you like settling for field goals and victories but not covers, then Eli’s your man — the Giants are 30th in the league when it comes to scoring TDs from the red zone.\nAnd finally, Joe Biden, for the love of God and country, please make up your mind about running for President. Can you imagine if the Gaffe Machine is manning the Oval Office when a crisis emerges? “Mr. President, North Korea has a nuclear missile targeted at the West Coast and is threatening to launch in the next 15 minutes. What should we do?” President Biden: “I don’t know. I just don’t know. I need time to mull.”\nBest bets: Bengals, Packers, Patriots\nThursday: Falcons\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:56:05.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
