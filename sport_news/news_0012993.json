This girl's memory is erased and she has a bunch of tattoos and no one knows who she is. \nQ What do you want to be when you grow up? \nA I want to be a nurse practitioner. It is one step under a doctor and you can work in the hospital and prescribe medicine. You can be a nurse or an RN. You can also be the active doctor. \nQ If you could go to space, which planet would you visit? \nA Mars. The whole talk is that there is water and that they are going to send people there, it just seems pretty interesting. \nQ If you were an animal, what kind would be? \nA Probably a dog. A Labrador retriever. I love Labs, I have four of my own. They are man's best friend. I love hunting and they are great hunting dogs. \nQ What everyday item could you not live without? \nA My phone. I got to stay in contact with my parents and good friends and my girlfriend, who goes to Stephen F. Austin . I use it every day. \nQ What has been your favorite vacation? \nA I went to New York and the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, Ohio when I was 12. I'd love to go back and see the new inductees. That was a once in a lifetime thing right there. \nQ What was your favorite childhood toy? \nA My baseball bat. I grew up with my dad coaching and it's what I grew up around. I would hit anything that was around or that you could throw up in the air. \nQ Who is your celebrity crush? \nA Jennifer Lopez . She's got it going on. \nQ What's your favorite thing about football? \nA The comradery of the team and how you get along with your teammates. They are not just your teammates, in football, you have to become family. I've always really liked that. \nQ Do you have a favorite movie? \nA Southpaw. It's a great movie. One of the best movies I've ever seen. I liked how it showed you can bounce back from adversity and to never give up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:31:03.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
