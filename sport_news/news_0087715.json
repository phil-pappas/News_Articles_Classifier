The return of DeAndre Levy should help, but this won't be the game the Lions offense finds its groove, which is the only way to turn things around. Cardinals 23-15 \nJohn Niyo: The protection was a bit better against the Seahawks, but the production still isn't with this offense. And the Lions had better put up some points because this Cardinals team will make an aggressive defense pay with big plays in the passing game. The home crowd won't have much patience, either, so an early score would do wonders. Lions 27-24 \nBob Wojnowski: The Cardinals have the right formula â€” play defense and trust a savvy quarterback, Carson Palmer, to make the right throws. The winless Lions have one antidote, and that's their pass rush. Ziggy Ansah led a fierce attack that sacked Seahawks QB Russell Wilson six times. If they can duplicate that, they should hit the immobile Palmer often. It's beyond desperation time now, and at home, the Lions will show it.
