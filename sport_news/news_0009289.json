While Johnson said he has no preference in terms of who he would rather face in the Fall Classic, he said he's more familiar with the Blue Jays, as he played in Toronto for two seasons.\n\"I've seen a lot of the Blue Jays,\" Johnson said. \"I played there and I know a lot of those guys. I've been in that division, so I've seen what that offense can do. If you make a mistake, they're a tough team to pitch to. They study and they're as prepared as any lineup in the game.\"\nJohnson also saw a lot of the Royals during last year's postseason, as he was a member of the Baltimore Orioles team that was swept by Kansas City in the ALCS.\nPLUS : Mets will have to fight losing battle against long layoff before World Series\n\"Kansas City, they've got so much confidence,\" Johnson said. \"They're going to win. They've now done it two years in a row and that lineup is equally tough. They've got some power, but they also don't give in. They're going to fight off pitches, make you work, and try to just get guys on and the next man up. Try to get the job done. In terms of the lineup, it's tough either way.\"\nRegardless of the opponent, the Mets will open the World Series on the road, with Game 1 slated to be played on Tuesday, Oct. 27, in the American League city. Johnson believes the Blue Jays would have an edge in terms of home-field advantage but said that both cities are capable of creating tough playing environments for opposing teams.\n\"Toronto is awfully similar to here,\" Johnson said. \"I think New York is completely unique and special. I think it's easily number one, but Toronto does have the fact that they're the only team in Canada. They fly that flag, they love it. You go to Toronto, that place is huge there's a lot of seats and they're going to fill every one of them.\n\"Kansas City, it's another giant venue. It's not quite as intimidating in terms of just the noise because it's more open, but both places have some great fans, they're going to be loud. Neither one is easy. I personally don't see a preference or a better matchup. But we'll be ready to play our game and we'll go from there.\"\nMaria Guardado may be reached at mguardado@njadvancemedia.com .
