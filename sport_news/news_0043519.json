Matthew Stevens \nAUBURN – After years of wondering if this day would come, Butch Thompson had to force himself to pause and reflect. \n“I can pause to take this in for a moment, can’t I?” Thompson said with a smile. “I’ve waited long enough.” \nAfter 15 years as an assistant coach in the Southeastern Conference, Auburn hired Thompson Thursday as its next head baseball coach. It is his first head coaching position at a major Power 5 conference school and a day Thompson wasn’t sure would come. \n“I feel battle tested, and, trust me, it's a battle in this league,” Thompson said. \nMultiple sources close to the situation confirmed to the Montgomery Advertiser Thursday morning that Thompson and Auburn athletics director Jay Jacobs came to a verbal agreement late Wednesday evening. \nDuring the media conference, Jacobs confirmed the deal with Thompson is a five-year contract worth $350,000 per year with certain performance bonuses attached. \n“It was amazing to me the number of former players, not only just at Auburn, but at other institutions, that called me about Butch,” Jacobs said Thursday. “Not only about his character and integrity, but how great of a teacher he was, and he was the kind of guy we'd want our son to play for.” \nNew Auburn baseball coach Butch Thompson shakes hands with Auburn football coach Gus Malzahn Thursday as Tigers athletics director Jay Jacobs looks on.

Thompson is noted as one of the best pitching coaches and recruiters currently in college baseball, especially the southeastern part of the country. During his seven-season tenure at MSU under head coach John Cohen , Thompson has involved in the development of 23 undrafted players out of high school into Major League Baseball draft picks. He was named the 2014 National Assistant Coach of the Year by both Baseball America and the American Baseball Coaches Association. \nThompson will be taking over the program from Sunny Golloway after he was dismissed with cause on Sept. 27. After Golloway’s controversial and turbulent two-year tenure at Auburn, Thompson addressed immediately that his first responsibility to inherit the trust of the current roster. \n“That was our first calling,” Thompson said with tears in his eyes. “I basically told them, 'It's OK. It's going to be OK.” \nOn Sept. 27, Jacobs announced that assistant coach Greg Norton , who played in Major League Baseball from 1996-2009, will be responsible for Auburn’s baseball operations until a new coach is hired. Jacobs said Thursday Thompson will be in charge of decisions made by current members of the Auburn staff. \nAaron Fitt , editor and national writer at d1baseball.com, told the Montgomery Advertiser Thursday that he felt the returning roster is “a borderline Top 25 team with a really talented freshman class.” \nThompson has recruited and developed 22 Division I All-America selections and 29 all-conference honors. \n“I know what an SEC player looks like,” Thompson said. “I’ve had the opportunity to coach first rounders as opposed to coming and trying to figure it out.” \nIn a media conference following the end of MSU’s final fall practice Wednesday night, Cohen addressed the news that Thompson was a top candidate for the vacant head coaching position at Auburn. \n“In the last 12 years I have been extremely fortunate to have two of the very best pitching coaches in the nation on my staff, both of whom are now head coaches in the Southeastern Conference,” Cohen said in a media statement Thursday. “We are proud and happy for Butch Thompson, and there is no one more deserving of this opportunity.” \nThe Montgomery Advertiser confirmed last week Auburn did bring Thompson on campus on Oct. 12 to interview for its open head baseball coach position. Jacobs said he interviewed “several” candidates for the position before deciding on Thompson Wednesday. \nSources close to the situation confirmed to the Montgomery Advertiser Thompson spoke to Jacobs, the Auburn baseball search committee and various head coaches including football coach Gus Malzahn , men’s basketball coach Bruce Pearl and Auburn softball coach Clint Myers . \nThompson, 44, was the pitching coach at Auburn for three seasons (2006-08) under head coach Tom Slater . Each of Auburn’s three recruiting classes with Thompson on staff were ranked among the top 20 in the nation, including a No. 5 national ranking in 2007. \n“In recruiting you get who you are, not who you want and that’s how I envision this with Auburn baseball,” Thompson said. “For us to get who we are and to attract that, potential student-athletes and their families have to have an identity their selves.” Auburn AD Jay Jacobs introducing Auburn baseball coach Butch Thompson.
