Previous courts have been divided, as they are around the US, equally between female and male students.\nRelated: Sweden adds gender-neutral pronoun to dictionary\nInstead of being crowned “king” or “queen”, the top vote earners at Madison West will be able to choose their titles. The gender-neutral term students suggested is “Regent Royalty”, a reference to the school’s symbol, a crown. Under the new arrangement, a same-sex couple or a couple in which one or both members do not conform to gender norms is possible, and both winners will receive a robe, a scepter and a crown.\nFor Arwen Sadler, 16, a junior with a non-binary gender identity and a member of the school’s Gender Sexuality Alliance, the change is “extremely validating”.\nThe main problem that we saw was that it was exclusively binary gender and non-binary people couldn’t be elected or [could] only be elected as the wrong gender, which would be extremely invalidating,” Sadler said.\nSadler and others researched schools that had adopted gender-neutral courts, and they approached their principal, Beth Thompson, last year as they began organizing the effort.\n“It was just kind of changing people’s thinking on the labelling and whatever terms we use, it is still extremely special,” Thompson said. “You are the two top vote getters. Changing the mindset really is an underlying force behind this, so for me changing the title is important.”\nFor Kate Scholz, 17, a senior and an officer on the student council, the decision to change the court rules makes the school more inclusive. “In that way it creates a stronger community because we want everybody to be comfortable sharing their ideas and their identities,” she said.\nThe Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network ( GLSEN ) said it did not have figures to determine how many schools have made similar changes. Within Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire also recently announced that its homecoming court would adopt gender-neutral titles, moving from “king” and “queen” to “homecoming royalty”. Sadler and the Gender Sexuality Alliance provided a list of other schools that have adopted gender-neutral courts that includes the University of Utah, Arizona State University, and North Eugene high school in Oregon.\nIn 2011 Mona Shores high school in Michigan shifted to a gender-neutral court after denying a transgender student’s homecoming king victory. The Mona Shores high school principal did not respond to a request for comment.\nShaneece Taylor, 16, a junior and a member of the Madison West high school’s Black Student Union (BSU), said her organization had supported the move to a general neutral court because “it was only right”.\n“We know as like BSU that we are also like a very oppressed group who doesn’t enjoy equality like the GSA and LGBTQ community. So we were standing hand in hand with them because we have the same struggle. We have the same fight.”\nLast week Wisconsin state legislature saw a proposal that would prevent transgender students from using school bathrooms appropriate for their genders.", "external_links": ["http://jezebel.com/5760982/high-school-establishes-gender-neutral-prom-court", "http://www.wpr.org/gender-restrictions-proposed-wisconsins-school-bathrooms", "http://www.wkow.com/story/30205217/2015/10/07/uwec-now-has-gender-neutral-homecoming-titles"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:31:52.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
