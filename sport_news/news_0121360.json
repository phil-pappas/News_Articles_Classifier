Every position is a competition, though the duo has worked hand-in-hand since day one. \n\"Taryn leaves the dorms Friday night, so there's not a bunch of noise, and stays at Zach Lujan's apartment. They help each other out, whether they're both healthy or both injured, and they've been through this before,\" SDSU head coach John Stiegelmeier said. \n\"He's been there for me ever since I got here. During the whole summer, start of fall camp, through fall camp, and then going into practice he's always been there. Didn't know if he was going to play or not this week. I was taking all the reps because he couldn't go yet. He was always there. First one there when I made a good play, made a bad play. He made my transition a lot easier,\" SDSU freshman quarterback Taryn Christion said. \nChristion shined in his collegiate debut, accounting for 320 total yards, including 99 rushing yards, and two total touchdowns. So, how did Taryn grade out? \n\"I would put it on his shoulders and say, how well did you play? He would say, I can play better, and he can. But, for the situation, a tremendous job,\" Stiegelmeier said. \nAs for this weekend's game at 11th-ranked Youngstown State, Lujan remains questionable, Christion is ready and able, and Stig isn't tipping his hand. \n\"The quarterback situation gives the media something to talk about. Obviously, we're going to rehab Zach Lujan and put in a game plan for Youngstown State, what's best to win that football game, and see how everybody is feeling on Friday,\" Stiegelmeier said. \nWhoever's under center, the Jacks head east with one goal in mind. \n\"We're going to remind our guys why we go on the road, and we go to Youngstown State for one reason, and that's to do everything we can to win a football game,\" Stiegelmeier said. \nThe seventh-ranked Jacks and number eleven Penguins play Saturday, in Youngstown, Ohio. Kickoff is set for 3:00. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
