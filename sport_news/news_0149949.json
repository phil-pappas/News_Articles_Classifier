Adidas, Kia decline to call for immediate Blatter exit Associated Press | \nZURICH (AP) — FIFA sponsors Adidas and Kia Motors are not following four of the organization's other corporate backers in demanding Sepp Blatter resigns immediately. \nThe president of world soccer's governing body rebuffed demands Friday from Budweiser, Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Visa to step down now — instead of holding on to power until February's emergency election. \nAdidas wouldn't discuss Blatter's status Saturday, only telling The Associated Press: \"The initiated reform process must continue quickly and transparently.\" \nAdidas has provided the match ball for every World Cup since 1970. \nKia has sponsored FIFA with corporate affiliate Hyundai since 1999. The South Korean firm told the AP that it doesn't \"have any comment at the present time regarding Sepp Blatter or our current FIFA sponsorship status.\" \nKia didn't respond when asked if that meant its FIFA deal, which runs through 2022, is no longer certain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:28:25.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
