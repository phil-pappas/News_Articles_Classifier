I didn't think it was going to be as difficult as it was but it was fun. It was an experience that will help the team build camaraderie and mental toughness.\" \nSeveral professional athletes have raved about mixed martial arts workouts have helped them prepare during the offseason. NFL sack master Jared Allen has incorporated MMA training into his routine for several years and NBA star Mike Miller has done the same while working with Ryan Bader , C.B. Dollaway and the team at Power MMA & Fitness in Arizona. \nJackson was well aware the UFC fighters were tough, but he never expected that the workouts they do to get ready for an upcoming competition would push him to the breaking point. \nJackson is a high-level basketball player who averages more than 16 points a game while playing over 32-minutes a night. Still working with the UFC fighters forced Jackson to understand his own personal thresholds in the gym while attempting to keep up with a training style that is non-stop, which allows competitors to stay explosive for a five minute round or potentially a 25-minute fight. \n\"It's non-stop action,\" Jackson said. \"We get more breaks, basketball players I feel, we get more breaks here and there and they are constantly battling through and pushing themselves. They really make sure they are ready to fight for five minute straight and they build their bodies up and the workouts are pretty insane. \n\"Sometimes we'd want to take a little break and the UFC guys would make us look a little weak so we had to dig deep down inside ourselves to push through. Even when they were fatigued you could tell they just pushed through and continued to go.\" \nThe physical aspects of MMA training aside, Jackson says the biggest benefit the players from the Pistons probably picked up working with the fighters was the mental toughness they exude both inside and outside the Octagon. \nFighters take punches but refuse to go down. \nFighters get caught in submissions but refuse to give up. Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC \nJackson says that same mentality could be huge for players on the Pistons when a game isn't going their way or the season starts to wear on them over 82 games. \n\"Everybody starts off the season feeling good. It's easy to start the season with a lot of energy and it's 0-0. By the end of the season you've had your ups and downs and that's why I think the offseason training is so important, that's when all the extra work you put in shows off,\" Jackson said. \n\"Guys start hitting the wall a little bit and the experience we had with the UFC guys and training with them, it really allows us to push through when we have that fatigue thing going on.\" \nUFC heavyweight Stipe Miocic saw the other side of the coin when he traveled a couple hours north from his home in Ohio to undergo some basketball training with the Pistons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:50:50.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
