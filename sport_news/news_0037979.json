Posted: Safety Will Parks is a rare success story on defense from UA's 2012 class (photo courtesy Arizona Athletics) Anthony Gimino TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - \nIt's like clockwork. The Arizona Wildcats lose a football game, and the complaining about the 3-3-5 defense begins. \nThe UA defense has been bad the past couple of weeks. That's the facts. You saw it (unless you ran from the room in horror). Arizona lost 56-30 to UCLA and 55-17 at Stanford. \nThe Bruins and Cardinal combined to have 22 possessions. They scored on 17 of them. \nSo ... \nIs it that 3-3-5 scheme? \nIs it all the injuries? \nI'd say it ain't the scheme. \nIt's just a scheme. It's unusual, but it's just a scheme. Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez and defensive coordinator Jeff Casteel have had success with it, know how to coach it, know how to trouble-shoot it. \nDon't get caught up in the numbers of it. A 3-3-5 is a lot like a 3-4 and it easily turns into a 4-3, too. At times, Arizona has put five men on the line of scrimmage. \n\"We play as much four-man front as we do a three-man front,\" Rodriguez said Monday. \"But when we play out a four-man front, two of the guys who do that are guys who are out.\" \nThat brings us to the injuries. \nLinebackers Scooby Wright is out for, probably, several more weeks. Derrick Turituri has been banged up much of the season, missed last week with a hip injury and isn't expected to play this Saturday at home against Oregon. Those guys, going about 250 and 265 pounds, respectively, moved up to defensive end in a four-man, pass-rushing front last season. \nAnd you probably know of the other injuries at linebacker -- Cody Ippolito (will miss the season), Haden Gregory (has missed three games) and DeAndre Miller (has missed two games and didn't start at Stanford because of a wrist injury). \n\"As a coach, when you talk about injuries when you lose, it's an excuse,\" Rodriguez said. \"When you talk about injuries when you win, it's logic. But the problem is compounded when it's at one position. ... It limits some of the packages that we can do.\" \nThe scheme is the easy target. Rodriguez said he heard similar complaints after losses at West Virginia. \n\"Just about 90 percent of teams run some form of a three-man front, either wholly or partially,\" Rodriguez said. \"I don't think it's the scheme as such. If your guys struggle to get off blocks, whether in a 3-man front or a four-man front, it's going to be an issue.\" \nThe 3-3-5 is no better or worse than anything else in this age of record-setting offense across college football. It just is. If that's what the coaches are comfortable with, that's what they should coach. \nBut no scheme is going to work without the talent. \n\"I think as you build the program and build depth, you can always overcome a couple of injuries, you hope,\" Rodriguez said. \"But when it's all at one position, it makes it a little big more challenging. But it is what it is. Now we know what it is, so it's our challenge as coaches to come up with something that gives us a chance to stop people.\" \nBased on the past couple of weeks, this defense is in big trouble. Scooby isn't coming off the sideline any time soon. I'd maintain the 2011 defense that capped the Mike Stoops era was worse -- allowing 6.59 yards per play;. These Cats are at 5.9 yards allowed per play, although, for better or worse, there is plenty of season to go. \nSpeaking of Stoops ... \nIf Arizona's issues on defense aren't scheme-related, then it must be personnel, right? \nStoops' final signing class in 2011 doesn't have much left on defense -- fifth-year senior defensive lineman Reggie Gilbert and junior nose tackle Sani Fuimaono, who returned to the team after taking a church mission. Rodriguez had to put together the 2012 class on the fly, and only four of 14 signed defensive players are still with the team. \nYou'd hope those two classes would have provided the foundation of the 2015 defense, but Rodriguez is still having to cobble together a lineup of, as he has said in the past, \"misfit toys.\" \nHere was Arizona's starting lineup at Stanford: \nDL Luca Bruno -- 2013 signee \nDL Sani Fuimaono -- returned from church mission, signed by Stoops \nDL Reggie Gilbert -- fifth-year senior signed by Stoops \nLB Jake Matthews -- an initial walk-on \nLB Sir Thomas Jackson -- an initial walk-on \nLB RJ Morgan -- 2013 signee \nCB DaVonte' Neal -- 2013 transfer receiver from Notre Dame \nCB Cam Denson -- 2014 signee as a receiver \nS Will Parks -- 2012 signee \nS Tellas Jones -- 2013 summer signee \nS Jamar Allah -- 2012 signee \nOf the 40 defensive signees from Rodriguez's first three Arizona recruiting classes who could still have eligibility, 17 are no longer with the program. In some cases, that's career-ending bad luck, or guys who needed kicked off, or guys who just left for whatever reasons. \nHere's a look: \nDE Dylan Cozens -- opted for pro baseball after being a second-round pick \nDE Kyle Kelley -- left team in spring 2014 \nDL Dwight Melvin -- academics \nLB Dakota Conwell -- left after 2013 fall camp because of concussion problems, but resurfaced as a QB at Division II West Liberty \nLB C.J. Dozier -- gave up football after 2013 fall camp because of concussion problems \nLB Keoni Bush-Loo -- Now known as Makani Kema-Kaleiwahea, he left in September 2014 and transferred to Hawaii \nDB Yamen Sanders -- transferred to Montana after last season \nDB Leo Thomas -- left after first day during first practice as true freshman \nDB Wayne Capers -- left after 2013 season; now a WR at Duquesne \nDB Bryan Harper -- left after 2012 season because of family reasons; transferred to Fresno State, but left during last season 2013 \nDL David Maka -- left shortly after arriving for summer school \nLB Ryan Dunn -- transferred to San Diego State after 2013 season \nDB Derek Babiash -- left in spring 2014, is at San Diego State \nDB David Price -- kicked off team this summer for a violation of team rules 2014 \nDE Jerod Cody -- had to give up football in 2014 fall camp because of concussion problems \nDB Rodney Carr -- left team this summer \nDB Patrick Glover -- left team during last season \nAnd in the team's latest recruiting class, junior college transfer end Timmy Hamilton, expected to boost the pass rush, left the program after about a week of fall camp. He is now at Kansas. \nIf you're wondering where Arizona's depth went ... there it is. \nCertainly, some of that is on Rodriguez and staff as it relates to truly getting more \"Our Kinda Guys.\" With a lack of depth, the recruiting \"misses\" -- and every team has them -- are more glaring. The four-star linebackers from the 2014 class -- Jamardre Cobb, Marquis Ware and junior college import Antonio Smothers -- have yet to make an impact, even with the spate of injuries at the position. \nThere are no easy answers on defense for this season, whether the Wildcats line up in their 3-3-5 or any other alignment. It's about personnel. There is no magic in football. The magic starts with recruiting and it continues through retention. \nCriticism of Arizona's defense is better directed to those areas. \nBut then, it's also worth asking ... \nDon't you trust a coaching staff that won 26 games and a Pac-12 South title in its first three years at Arizona? \n- - - \nAnthony Gimino has covered University of Arizona athletics for more than two decades, including as the football beat writer for the Arizona Daily Star and the columnist for the Tucson Citizen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:09:42.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
