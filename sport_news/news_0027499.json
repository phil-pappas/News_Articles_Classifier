Our colleagues had to operate on each other,\" she said.\nThe United States military took responsibility on Tuesday for the air strike on Saturday that killed 22 people, including 12 MSF staff, calling it a mistake.\nUS defence secretary Ash Carter, speaking to reporters in Rome on Wednesday, said: \"We are conducting a full and transparent investigation and will make the findings of that investigation known as they are found and will hold accountable anyone responsible for conduct that was improper.\"\nThe Afghan ministry of defence said on Sunday Taliban fighters had attacked the hospital and were using the building \"as a human shield\", which the medical group denied, while pointing out it would be a war crime not to treat the wounded.\n'War has rules'\nLiu said an impartial commission, which can be set up at the request of a single state under the Geneva Conventions that establish international standards for conducting war, was needed due to \"inconsistencies between the US and Afghan accounts\".\n\"We cannot rely on internal investigations by US, Nato and Afghan forces,\" she said.\nThe United Nations has condemned the attack but said it would wait for the results of US, Nato and Afghan investigations before deciding whether to support an independent probe.\nAsked to clarify whether MSF would seek criminal justice, MSF lead legal counsel Francoise Saulnier told Reuters: \"We don't know what will be the next step. We don't want to eliminate any option.\"\nMSF said it sent a letter on Tuesday to the 76 countries who ratified the additional protocol of the Geneva Convention that set up the Swiss-based commission of 15 experts in 1991. It was in talks with Switzerland about maybe convening the commission.\nNeither the United States nor Afghanistan are sigNatories to the commission, and the consent of the states involved is necessary to activate the unprecedented inquiry, Saulnier said.\nMSF's hospital in Kunduz had treated nearly 400 people, including some Taliban, wounded in heavy fighting in the days before the attack, MSF's Bruno Jochum said.\nIts GSP coordinates had been shared with all authorities.\n\"We had eight ICU (intensive care unit) beds with ventilators, this was high-tech medicine. This was not the little bush hospital. You could not miss it,\" Liu said.\n\"Today we say enough, even war has rules.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T19:40:23.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
