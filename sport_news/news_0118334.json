Bharti was addressing a workshop on the Ganga cleanliness programme at Parmarth Niketan, Rishikesh, today. She said the Union Government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was totally committed to making the Ganga neat and clean. The Union Water Resources Ministry had prepared a comprehensive work plan to ensure cleanliness in the Ganga, she said. She asserted that all the state governments and political parties concerned were actively cooperating in the Namami Gange programme. The Centre was providing funds to the state governments for the programme in 70 to 30 ratio, but now the Centre would be contributing the entire 100 per cent amount for the programme. The participation of the NGOs was also being ensured in the programme, she stated. The Union Minister said while the Centre was for cleanliness of the Ganga, it would not interfere in peopleâ€™s faith of conducting the last rites of their deceased relatives on the banks of the holy river. She added that the Centre had prepared a work plan for starting organic agriculture along the Ganga banks. The Central Government would leave no stone unturned to ensure that the Ganga became totally pollution free, Uma Bharti added. BJP national vice-president Dr Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, national convener of Namami Gange Trivendra Singh Rawat and Dr Hridyanath Singh also addressed the workshop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:22:08.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
