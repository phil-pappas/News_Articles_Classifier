Here's Doug's take on the Buckeyes heading into Saturday's matchup. \nQ: Can you just get Rutgers fans up to speed on the QB situation? Why did Urban Meyer chose Cardale Jones before the season and then stick with him despite his inconsistent play? And then why did Meyer finally make the change to J.T. Barrett this week ? \nA: I think Urban Meyer took a gamble on upside with Jones and it didn't pay off because there weren't the things around him to help him succeed. Jones didn't seize the day, but he also doesn't have a deep threat, the offensive line and play-calling were inconsistent early and he lost his quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator, Tom Herman, to Houston in the offseason. None of those things helped. The offense most naturally fits a dual-threat quarterback who can run the read-option, and that's what they are back to now with Barrett. A lot of people, me included, thought that's why Barrett would be the choice at the start, and now Meyer has come around to what most fans wanted, and he did it without really losing anything while taking the shot with Jones. They are still undefeated and No. 1. \nQ: What impact do you think the QB change will have on the team? Is there any chance we see Jones on Saturday? \nA: Meyer wants to keep Jones involved, but unlike the last two weeks when Barrett was the red zone quarterback, this is not a two-quarterback system. We'll only see Jones at the end of a blowout, but I think Meyer will take the chance to do that earlier than most coaches would with a backup. \nThe offense will run a lot more read-option with Barrett and Ezekiel Elliott, which looked great against Penn State. But Barrett hasn't thrown much this year, and Meyer wants to get the pass game settled, so I think Barrett could chuck it around quite a bit as well. \nQ: Obviously Ohio State has more weapons than just the quarterbacks. Everyone has seen a few of the highlights, but how has the Braxton Miller experiment at receiver gone overall? You've seen some good running backs for and against Ohio State over the years, where does Ezekiel Elliott rank in your book? \nA: Braxton Miller is still a work in progress in my opinion. Meyer keeps talking about how he's developing as a complete receiver, but his contributions have been in spurts, not on a regular basis, and his blocking has been decent at times, but I don't think it's there every down. Has it worked? Yes. But he's not a dominant force. \nElliott is. The offensive line and receiver blocking hasn't been great, so he hasn't been busting out 200-yard games like the postseason a year ago. But he's a tremendous blocker, has toughness to break tackles and speed to run away and, I think, actually may still be underrated a bit as LSU's Leonard Fournette goes crazy this year. Elliott is elite. \nPLUS: Rutgers-Ohio State game officially a sellout \nQ: On the other side of the ball, what makes defensive end Joey Bosa so dominant? Who are some of the other players on defense Rutgers fans will want to look out for? \nA: Bosa has it all, power pass rush moves and speed and quickness. He doesn't have many sacks, but he has been disruptive. Look to see him knock a couple guys backward Saturday - his dad and uncle were first-round NFL picks as defensive ends, so he knows how to play the position. \nI keep telling people to watch junior safety Vonn Bell, but he's not a secret anymore. He made ESPN's first-team midseason All-American team. He's a missile attacking wide runs and receiver screens and a playmaker on the ball in the pass game. \nQ: Ohio State is undefeated and winning by an average of 19 points per game, but from afar, it seems like things aren't totally clicking. What's the take on that in Columbus? How did a very flawed Indiana team take Ohio State to the wire a few weeks ago? \nA: Urban Meyer doesn't like that take. He showed a little fire Wednesday night when questioning why people are asking what's wrong with Ohio State? He mentioned that margin of victory and their 20-game win streak. The bar is high, for sure. But with all this talent back, they just haven't looked like they did late last year. But all the potential is there on both sides. It hasn't just been one issue — not just QB play, for instance — so there's no quick fix. But they could be rounding into form. As much as they like to remind people that they are still undefeated, Indiana threw a pass into the end zone to tie the game on the last play and hit a receiver in the hands. That was just a defense allowing big plays and an offense turning it over and making mistakes in the red zone. They've worked on all of that. But they are also lucky they haven't played a tougher schedule — no team in their 7-0 start is within sniffing distance of the current top 25 — or they might have a loss. \nQ: What's Ohio State's weakness? I'm guessing you're not going to predict a Rutgers upset in the next question, but what could the Scarlet Knights exploit that could give them a chance? \nI don't know. Like I said, the issues have changed week to week. But let's try two things. They have an injury at defensive tackle and a new starter there Saturday, and the defense was already getting hit with the inside run in some games. If you have a running back, or even better a quarterback, who can hit the defense inside, that can work. The other thing is a defense that could somehow sell out to stop the run and force the Buckeyes to throw. The receivers beyond Michael Thomas aren't consistently great and Barrett just hasn't thrown it much this year. \nQ: What's your prediction? \nA: I predicted before the season a regular-season loss that no one sees coming, and then the Buckeyes would recover and go on to repeat as national champs. I don't see any chance that this is that loss: 45-13 Ohio State. \nThanks to Dough for taking the time.
