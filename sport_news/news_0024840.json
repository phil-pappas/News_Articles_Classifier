It's just something I have to play through.\" \nRobinson has a history of being able to play through injuries. \nRobinson suffered a high ankle sprain against Tennessee last October. \nSaban thought Robinson may miss as much as a month. \nRobinson didn't miss a game. \nFollowing a bye week, he played against LSU, helping the Tide pull out a 20-13 overtime win. \nRobinson didn't miss any practices this summer after suffering a sprained knee. \nWhile limited, he was back participating the next day. \n\"Some guys can deal with those types of things and it doesn't bother them,\" Saban said during the summer. \"He seems to be one of those guys that doesn't complain much and really can manage the bumps and bruises that you get playing football. Everybody gets them, and some people can manage them and some people don't.\" Nick Saban post-game press conference (Texas A&M) Nick Saban spoke to the media after his team's 42-23 victory over Texas A&M about Derrick Henry, the status of his center, and what his halftime message was to the team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:29:50.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
