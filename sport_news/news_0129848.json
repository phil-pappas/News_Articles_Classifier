His .835 save percentage and 5.07 goals-against average are the worst in the NHL.\n\"I have zero confidence right now,'' Bobrovsky said following a 7-2 loss to Ottawa last week.\nIt was a shocking admission for the former Vezina Trophy winner, but not as shocking as the Blue Jackets' abysmal play. Their record fell to 0-7 after a 4-0 loss to the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Coach Todd Richards was fired Wednesday and replaced by Tortorella, who has a .538 career winning percentage in 14 years as an NHL coach.\n\"Confidence is an easy word to say, but it's a pretty difficult thing to gain back,'' Tortorella said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday. \"Bob is a good goalie; it's going to come back. We just need to play better around him.\n\"I have addressed the team for five minutes and have not talked to Bob one-on-one, and I think that's going through the team as far as lack of confidence.''\nThe Blue Jackets touted this team as its most talented. The expectation clearly was to return to the playoffs for the second time in three years, especially with the off-season addition of Brandon Saad from the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\"This is the third-youngest team in the National Hockey League. A lot of things go crazy when you have those expectations put upon those kids,'' Tortorella said.\nThe Blue Jackets gave Tortorella a three-year contract for what is his fourth gig as a head coach. He is known as a firebrand who can either inspire or wear on players, but always holds them accountable.\nTortorella, 57, will be reunited with a player who fell in the latter category, Columbus center Brandon Dubinsky , while both were with the New York Rangers. Tortorella was fired in 2013, his fifth season in New York.\n\"I think my relationship with Torts fell apart the last year I was there and I just felt like his relationships with some of the other players could be doing the same thing,\" Dubinsky told The Bergen Record in 2013. \"I guess that sums it up as to why I wasn't completely surprised that it happened.\"\nDuring his conference call Wednesday, Tortorella praised Dubinsky for sticking up for Richards just before he was fired.\n\"It's not just (Richards),\" Dubinsky told the Columbus Dispatch. \"There's 23 guys in here. He's working his (butt) off. He's trying to change things, make us a better team. For the majority of seven games, we haven't gone out and executed. It's unfair on our part to play in front of him that way.\n\"He cares a lot about winning. He cares deeply about this organization, the city, the fans, the team, the players. ... I feel like we're letting him down, and it's unfortunate. It's a really (crappy) feeling.\"\nTortorella said the Blue Jackets need to develop an identity, another elusive trait. He did not offer many specifics.\n\"I really have not watched them that much this year,'' he said. \"My biggest goal is for us to play our game.''\nTortorella coached seven years in Tampa Bay, five in New York and just one season in Vancouver. He said he deserved to be fired after a 36-35-11 record in Vancouver last season with a team that, like Columbus, suffered numerous injuries.\n\"That second half of the year, I did not do a good enough job of trying to scratch out a way to win when we had our injuries. I probably should have been fired,'' he said.\nIt didn't alter his own confidence, however.\n\"You have to have thick skin,'' he said. \"I love it.''\nAn immediate and obvious area of need for the Blue Jackets is defense. The Columbus Dispatch's Aaron Portzline reported the Blue Jackets are trying to acquire New Jersey defenseman Adam Larsson in exchange for Cam Atkinson.\nIn lieu of better players, Tortorella said a better approach was needed on defense, particularly in blocking shots in front of the net.\n\"The onus belongs on the coach to try to teach defense and get the puck back,'' Tortorella said.\nTortorella began his NHL coaching career with Tampa Bay and compiled a 239-222-74 record in 535 games during six-plus seasons with the club from 2001-08. He led the Lightning to the Southeast Division title in 2002-03 and 2003-04. In the latter campaign, he won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year as the club went 46-22-14 (106 points) and won the Stanley Cup.\nHe joined the Rangers in February 2009 and posted a 171-118-30 record in 319 games with the club, including a four-game stint as interim coach during the 1999-00 season. He led New York to the playoffs on four occasions and ranks fourth on the club's all-time wins list and is fifth in games coached. In 2011-12, he guided the Rangers to the third-best regular season in franchise history with a 51-24-7 mark (109 points) and a spot in the Eastern Conference Final. He joined the Canucks prior to 2013-14 and had a 36-35-11 mark.\nInternationally, Tortorella was an assistant coach with Team USA at the 2010 Olympic Games and helped the club capture a silver medal. He also served as the squad's head coach at the 2008 World Championships and was an assistant coach for Team USA at the 2005 World Championships.\nHe began his coaching career in 1986-87 with the Virginia Lancers of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League, leading the club to a championship and winning Coach of the Year honors in back-to-back seasons in 1986-87 and 1987-88. He returned to coaching with the American Hockey League's Rochester Americans from 1995-97 and won the 1996 Calder Cup championship in his first season. He went on to serve as an assistant coach with the Buffalo Sabres, Phoenix Coyotes and Rangers.", "external_links": ["http://bluejackets.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8471273", "http://www.northjersey.com/sports/blue-jackets-brandon-dubinsky-not-a-fan-of-ex-rangers-coach-john-tortorella-1.609657"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:08:19.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
