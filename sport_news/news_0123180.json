You know it's there,\" said Spieth. \"But man, what a comeback we had there. That was a great fight. And it was a huge point in the Presidents Cup.\"\nThe Americans' task was made that much easier on 18 after Schwartzel tried to bite off too much in a fairway bunker, smacked the lip and saw his ball roll back into the sand trap.\n\"I had a poor shot, I had 5-iron on 18 and I just hit it square in the teeth,\" said the South African.\n\"That ball has got no more teeth left.\"\nThe U.S. players were rubbing Phil Mickelson's belly for luck on Saturday but Bubba Watson should perhaps have rubbed a bit harder.\nAfter snapping his driver on the practice range and needing a replacement club rushed to him out on the course, the left-hander then muffed a five-foot putt on 18 that would have sealed the win over Adam Scott and Marc Leishman.\nThat match ended halved, as did the next fixture, which saw Bae Sang-moon and Hideki Matsuyama fight back on the last to earn a half-point against Bill Haas and Matt Kuchar.\nThe International team are chasing just their second win at the biennial event while the United States are going for their ninth victory in 11 editions of the Cup, which is being played in Asia for the first time this year.\nThe Americans, who led 4-1 after the first day, now lead 7 1/2 to 6 1/2 going into the afternoon four-balls. The event concludes on Sunday with 12 singles matches.\nGrace and Oosthuizen have played solid golf in South Korea and the South Africans agreed confidence was sky high.\n\"I think it grows every day the better we play,\" said Grace. \"There was a couple of slips towards the middle there but we got it going.\"\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:02:40.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
