The Carolina Panthers have been without superstar linebacker Luke Kuechly for three games because of a concussion, but that’s about to change.\nAdChoices According to Jonathan Jones of The Charlotte Observer , “an independent doctor” has cleared the Boston College product from \"concussion protocol,\" who will return to practice at a perfect moment for the 4-0 Panthers.\nKuechly, who has racked up more than 150 tackles in each of his first three years, exited during the season opener. Nevertheless, Carolina has taken advantage of a weak early-season schedule—opponents have a combined 5-15 record—and jumped out to a 4-0 start.\nBut why is it a perfect moment? Well, the Panthers are preparing for a statement game against the Seattle Seahawks, who desperately need a victory to avoid dropping another game.\nIt seems a majority of NFL fans aren’t yet sold on Carolina, who despite lacking a reliable wide receiver and standout running back have amassed the league’s sixth-best scoring offense behind quarterback Cam Newton. Plus, the Panthers defense has surrendered the fourth-fewest points per game (17.8) even without their All-Pro linebacker.\nThe 4:05 p.m. ET kickoff on Sunday will give Kuechly and Co. a chance to prove Carolina is for real—and perhaps more importantly, potentially put more distance between itself and Seattle in the Wild Card standings.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/jjones9/status/653931882313314304"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:47:38.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
