Chase Utley is a dirty word in New York but the weekend’s biggest sports villain is, hands down, Greg Hardy.\nYou know of Hardy as the unremorseful pass rusher extraordinaire who is one of the more unlikable scoundrels to ever wear a Cowboys uniform. And that’s saying something. He also happens to be pretty darn good at chasing after quarterbacks and this morning Tom Brady has the bumps and bruises to show for it.\nBut Hardy is the hardest NFL player to root for since Ray Rice. It’s one thing to have Mets fans on your bad side and poor Utley could be in for an unpleasant couple of days at Citi Field.\nHardy, however, even has the national media piling on. Luckily for him, he’s got Jerry Jones on his side.\nDuring the week, FS1’s Katie Nolan called Hardy a “garbage human” and on Sunday, broadcasters Jim Nantz and Terry Bradshaw both criticized Hardy’s conduct in the days leading up to his Dallas debut. Hardy served a four-game suspension for accusations he violently beat up his then-girlfriend and threw her on a pile of firearms. Bradshaw reminded viewers that the case was dismissed when the woman failed to show up in court.\nNolan and Nantz picked apart Hardy’s jaw-dropping press conference this week, which included Hardy saying he planned to return “guns blazing” while making sexist comments about Brady’s model wife.\nNantz called Hardy’s comments “absolutely outrageous, unrepentant” and “there was nothing funny about it.” You don’t want Nantz on your bad side.\nPhil Simms simply addressed the football impact Hardy will make on the field. And it will be significant. If the Cowboys can ever get Tony Romo back, they will be a formidable team. And easier than ever to root against.\nLET’S NOT GO TO VIDEOTAPE\nWe discovered a few years ago that a catch is no longer a catch in the NFL. What was considered a reception 10, 20, 30, 50 years ago is now open for interpretation because in the NFL each critical play is reviewed more than the Zapruder film.\nThe Cowboys found out the hard way last January when Dez Bryant’s crucial catch in a playoff game at Green Bay was overturned on replay review. Something about Bryant not “maintaining control all the way to the ground.”\nRight.\nOn Sunday, the Atlanta Falcons nearly saw their perfect record ruined due to a ridiculous rule. Devonta Freeman caught a pass from Matt Ryan, both feet hit the field and he extended the ball over the goal line. Touchdown?\nOriginally, it was ruled a catch but the replay showed that Freeman lost the ball once his back hit the turf. Incomplete pass. But that was after getting both feet down and having the ball crossing the goal line. So what’s the problem?\nPeter Aiken/Getty Images Jamaal Charles tears his ACL Sunday and is lost for the season. Basically, the NFL rules committee doesn’t consider it a reception until you place the ball in your trophy case.\nJustice prevailed when Freeman scored a go-ahead touchdown two plays later in a game Atlanta won in overtime when Washington QB Kirk Cousins threw a pick-6.\nNO JOSHING\nThe RedZone was made for days like Sunday when a majority of the 1 p.m. games were tight finishes including three that went into overtime.\nWhat we learned is that the great Ravens and Seahawks defenses are a thing of the past. Josh McCown threw for a team-record 457 yards in a 33-30 Browns win at Baltimore. That is not a misprint. Josh McCown went Tom Brady on the Ravens, who fell to 1-4.\nSeattle entered the fourth quarter at Cincinnati leading 24-7 and lost in overtime as Andy Dalton threw for 331 yards and 2 TDs. Dalton doesn’t have a very good playoff resume but he’s pretty darn good in the regular season.\nAtlanta, Cincinnati, Green Bay and Denver are all going to be playoff teams. At least according to the numbers: 91% of the teams that start 5-0 reach the playoffs.\nJay Cutler, who engineered Chicago’s game-winning drive in the final minute at Kansas City, is too talented to be so inconsistent. Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles reportedly suffered a torn ACL in the third quarter.\nWhat is the record this season for most consecutive plays without an injury? Four? Five?\nCharles Woodson, who entered the league with Peyton Manning in 1998, intercepted Manning for the first time on Sunday.\nWorst non-NFL football moments of the weekend: The reports that Maryland would fire head coach Randy Edsall if the Terps lost — as if they had any chance winning — to top-ranked Ohio State turned out to be true.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Soccer Federation suffered two big losses on Saturday. The U23 team missed a chance to qualify for the Rio Olympics by losing to Honduras. A few hours later, the senior national team failed to reach the Confederations Cup next summer in Russia after losing a thrilling 3-2 match to Mexico in overtime. Donald Trump can’t be happy.\nAssuming there are no traffic issues and Matt Harvey shows up for work on schedule, you wonder if and when Harvey’s agent, Scott Boras, will instruct his client to retaliate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:10:29.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
