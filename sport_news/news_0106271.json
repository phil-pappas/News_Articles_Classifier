But some of the college football programs recruiting him weren't sure why he wasn't on the field.\n\"Some schools didn't know,\" Anthony said. \"They still ask me now why I didn't play the first three games.\"\nHe said most of the programs recruiting him shared words of encouragement and after Anthony was ruled eligible after an appeal earlier this month, the standout will make his debut Thursday night when Karr hosts Riverdale at Behrman Stadium.\nAnthony joked that his first game will be like \"Superman Returns,\" but the No. 20 prospect in the NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune Nifty 50 could be the spark the 0-3 Cougars need to jump-start their season.\nKarr's last two losses, to Brother Martin and Landry-Walker, were both by just three points.\n\"I'm going to be that extra fuel to the fire,\" Anthony said. \"We can still make this district run and championship run. We just got to be more focused.\"\nAnthony said he's planning on letting everyone know he's back in a big way.\n\"In my mind, I'm thinking I've got to get a sack a quarter,\" He said. \"I'm trying to dominate. I'm just trying to make sure my presence is felt.\"\nHe did his best to make his presence felt while he was sitting out, as well. The Cougars voted Anthony one of their team captains over the summer citing his leadership. He did his best to fulfill that roll during practice and from the sidelines.\nAnthony admitted it was difficult at times practicing knowing that he couldn't play in that week's game.\n\"Sometimes they'd start going through plays that they were going to do in a game and I'd have to get out so the players who will play could take those reps.\" he said. \"It was kind of frustrating.\"\nAnthony also said there were times he felt he could've impacted a game if he were in.\n\"Not to be cocky or anything but some plays that had been missed I felt like i could've made that play or told the player behind me watch out for this,\" he said.\nThroughout the appeal process Anthony said he had a feeling he would eventually get to play his senior season.\n\"I trusted that my family would do everything they could, other people would try to help me and I just had faith in God and knew he would help me get out of this situation,\" Anthony said.\nAnthony and his mother will visit LSU this weekend for the Tigers' matchup against Eastern Michigan. He said he hasn't scheduled any official visits and the only one he knows he'll take is to the Tigers.\nNebraska and Miami were the latest offers for Anthony who said he also holds offers from Ole Miss, Auburn, Alabama, Tennessee, Texas A&M, Florida and Oregon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:04:41.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
