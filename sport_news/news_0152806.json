Using a lineup without starters Adam Eaton, Jose Abreu and Melky Cabrera, the Sox totaled just three hits on the way to being shut out for the 12th time this year.\nTurning point\nTyler Collins' three-run triple off Daniel Webb pushed the Tigers ahead 5-0 in the seventh.\nOn the mound\nMontas settled down after a rough start, retiring the final nine batters he faced. He gave up one run on two hits with three walks and seven strikeouts over four innings, a short outing because he pitched most of September out of the bullpen.\nOffseason surgery\nAdam Eaton will have arthroscopic surgery to clean up his left shoulder Monday after he played through pain for much of the second half. He said a quick recovery is expected.\nKey number\n76-86 — The Sox's record, a three-game improvement from 2014.\nThe Quote:\n\"Very disappointing, absolutely. But now it's time, you go back to work and try to figure out what you're going to be doing in the future, as far as guys making it to spring training.\" — Sox manager Robin Ventura\nThe Quote: II\n\"In the first inning I wasn't executing my pitches. Once I calmed down and figured out the situation, I felt much better. I was pitching at my pace and I was feeling good.\" — Montas\nUp next\nAt Athletics, 9:05 p.m. April 4, 2016.\n Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago White Sox Detroit Tigers Francellis Montas Adam Eaton Melky Cabrera", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56116b6f/turbine/ct-gameday-white-sox-tigers-spt-1005-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:51:39.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
