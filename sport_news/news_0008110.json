Harris averaged 15 yards a completion and had a 50-yard touchdown pass and a 52-yard completion that set up a touchdown. \n“It was a statement,” Harris said Saturday. “We’re all playing with a chip on our shoulder. People have been doubting us. Well, they can keep doubting us. If they want to play us with nine in the box, so be it.” \nSince talking about how he checked out of several passes to runs in the Sept. 12 Mississippi State game during the following week, Harris has been allowed to be interviewed only immediately after games – not during game week. That policy is expected to continue for the rest of the season. \n“I think everybody plays with a little want to prove that they can best an opponent and contribute to a team,” Miles said. “There’s always a personal chip in this. You don’t play football at risk of injury without playing with a little passion and caring about how you’re received.” \nHarris, who was just 4-of-15 passing against Eastern Michigan on Oct. 3, is coming off two very good games since then. He had three career highs in the 45-24 win over South Carolina on Oct. 10 as he completed 18 of 28 passes for 228 yards. And he is up to seventh in the Southeastern Conference in passing efficiency at 140.7 entering Saturday’s 6 p.m. game between No. 5 LSU (6-0, 4-0 SEC) and Western Kentucky (6-1, 4-0 Conference USA) on ESPNU. \nHarris is 64-of-108 passing for 812 yards and six touchdowns with zero interceptions. \n“But he needs not to worry about that at all in reality,” Miles said of Harris’ desire to prove his doubters wrong. “The opinions that matter will all come from that room – that big building that we practice in. And he’ll need not to worry about what others say. Others don’t know. And all they have to do is watch the film. All they have to do is see him spin a couple of passes for them to realize that, no, this guy can throw it. So he needs to just do the things that he’s been doing and not try to exceed the play call.” \nSPECIALS TEAMS STILL NOT: The Tigers solved their kickoff issues last week as Florida returners averaged just 11 yards a return after South Carolina’s Rashad Fenton returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown against LSU the previous week. But Florida’s Antonio Callaway returned a punt back 72 yards for a touchdown against the Tigers Saturday. \nLSU remained 127th and last in the nation in punt return defense this week, but its “lead” grew. The Tigers are allowing 32.8 yards a punt return – up nine yards from a week ago. The second worst punt return defense in the nation this week is Bowling Green with 22 yards allowed a return. \n“We made nice strides in kickoffs,” Miles said. “Now, let’s handle the punt, and we’ll be in good shape. It’s certainly coaching and execution and just putting it together.” Read or Share this story: http://on.wwltv.com/1LJytLV TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:16:12.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
