Hutchinson's relatives noticed the smell, officials said. \nHutchinson has been missing since Sept. 20. \nAfter searching various areas of the building, detectives located a crawl space hidden behind a false wall inside a closet in her apartment, officials said. They removed the wall panel and found an adult female's body hidden inside. \nNew Hampshire Attorney General Joe Foster and Manchester police believe the body to be that of Hutchinson. \nHutchinson's roommate, Stephen Andrade, 36, also disappeared about the same time last month. \nAndrade killed himself in a Massachusetts motel on Oct. 6. Based on statements Andrade made shortly before he killed himself, officials said it appears likely he killed Hutchinson, hid her body and fled. \nAn autopsy will be done on Hutchinson's body on Tuesday. A definitive identification is expected at that time. Top Jobs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:55:41.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
