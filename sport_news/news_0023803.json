After rumbling 38 yards, Watts-Jackson fell into the end zone to seal the improbable 27-23 MSU win .\nThe play will be debated for years, the one that lost the game for the Wolverines.\n\"Just a matter of catching it and punting it,\" coach Jim Harbaugh said. \"And we messed it up.\"\nBut what about the first 59:50 of the game? As the Wolverines admitted later, it was not all on O'Neill.\n\"There's a lot of things throughout the game that could have changed,\" linebacker Desmond Morgan said on Sunday's \"Inside Michigan Football\" show. \"But to lose like that, it's very unfortunate.\"\nWorking backward from the fateful play, many opportunities were squandered — by coaching, offense and de fense — in addition to the special-teams gaffe.\nAfter Watts-Jackson had the ball and was racing toward the end zone, Michigan still had a chance to tackle him and the clock could have expired. Defensive back Wayne Lyons had a face-to-face look for the tackle inside the 10, but was being held and pushed — no flag thrown — allowing Watts-Jackson to cut back inside.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMichigan's Jake Rudock, on loss to MSU: 'It just sucks'\nBefore the snap, why did U-M plan to send two gunners downfield far outside the protection — one without an MSU player across from him — despite the Spartans not having a return man deep? Those players could have stayed in tighter to block and maybe limit the rush.\nHarbaugh said during the time-out just before that he considered all the options, including going for it on fourth-and-2, but those scenarios likely would have left MSU with a few seconds left for a Hail Mary. What if he made a different decision and either gained the 2 yards or ran at least 6-7 seconds off the clock? While he made the call most likely to use the most time, it also was risky, with a block appearing possible if not for the fumble.\nThe first three plays of that drive could have rendered all of that moot. But U-M could run the ball only three times for 8 yards, not 10, which would have clinched it.\nThe passing game had its opportunity, too. Leading by two points with 6:41 left, the Wolverines could have made it a two-score game. With receiver Jehu Chesson getting a deep edge on the secondary, all quarterback Jake Rudock had to do was lay the ball out and a touchdown awaited. Instead, he overthrew Chesson.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nWindsor: Final crazy play shows strength of both MSU, U-M\nMichigan's defense wasn't immune, either. The nation's previously second-ranked defense stood up on the penultimate drive, halting MSU on a fourth-and-19. But earlier in the fourth quarter, the defense had an uncharacteristic letdown. Michigan State fullback Trevon Pendleton caught a short pass and rumbled 74 yards to set up a 1-yard touchdown, stunning for a defense that had allowed only one play longer than 30 yards all season.\nIt was a game slipping away the entire fourth quarter.\nThe defense's problems on the decisive 74-yarder: safety Jarrod Wilson just waved at Pendleton, and Delano Hill didn't even see him run past, leaving him wide open.\nThe offense managed three points on five drives (only one of those drives was longer than four plays or 8 yards) and finished 1-for-6 on third down.\nAnd that was all just one quarter.\nSome will complain about the questionable penalties against U-M, including linebacker Joe Bolden's ejection, but this was larger than that.\nUnder Brady Hoke, Michigan struggled to finish games and that led to his downfall. In two close games this season, the Wolverines have made crucial fourth-quarter mistakes that have kept them from wins.\nPutting it all on O'Neill is too narrow a view. The steady decline setting it up was a team effort.\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com . Follow him on Twitter at @mark__snyder.
