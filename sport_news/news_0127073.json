I think (Maccabi) tried their best but we worked very hard and we deserved this,\" Dynamo coach Serhiy Rebrov said.\nMaccabi coach Slavisa Jokanovic admitted that his side were not used to the level of opposition they were facing in the Champions League.\n\"After 11 years, Maccabi realised their dream and made it into the group stages of the Champions League and it is a dream come true but it is very difficult at this level,\" he said.\n\"We still have 12 points that we can gain and we will fight. Tonight we fought as much as we could but I am not disappointed, we know that Dynamo Kiev are a better team than we are,\" Jokanovic added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:24:00.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
