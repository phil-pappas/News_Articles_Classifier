But that has eroded as the Florida Republicans battling for the presidential nomination have come to see the other as the main threat to lofty ambitions: Bush claims the party establishment's mantle; Rubio wants to be the party's fresh national face.\nBush now routinely compares Rubio's background to Barack Obama's before the Democrat became president. Rubio says it's \"time to turn the page,\" a reference that strikes as hard at Bush's long family legacy as it does at Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nRepublican Presidential candidiate Marco Rubio speaks during the Republican Committee of Chester County Fall Reception at the Crowne Plaza in King of Prussia, Pa., Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015. ( Elizabeth Robertson, The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP ) The rise of GOP outsiders such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson has increased the stakes for Bush and Rubio as they try to become the mainstream alternative. Whoever wins this internal contest will show whether experience or fresh leadership is the bigger priority for GOP centrists.\nFrom Bush, there's a sense of urgency in his contention that Rubio, in his first Senate term, has not proved his leadership credentials. The ex-governor and his team are frustrated, too, that this shortcoming they attribute to Rubio has not become more of a liability for him.\nIt's part of the mantra Bush has repeated since the Republicans' second debate in California a month ago, when Rubio won praise for staying above the fray. He has since drawn nearly even with Bush in national polls, although both remain in the high single digits.\nAdvertisement \"We've got a president that the American people supported based on the fact that he was an eloquent guy,\" Bush said in Iowa last week. \"And he had nothing in his background that would suggest he could lead.\"\nWhile describing Obama, it's a slight to Rubio. He delivers a compelling story about his parents' flight from Cuba and his working-class background, but he has been in the Senate less than five years and has missed much of its business this year while campaigning for president.\nEvidence of the tension between the Florida politicians was on display Thursday when Rubio's campaign, minutes after the Bush organization announced raising $13.4 million in the last quarter, boasted it had more cash on hand. Rubio reported having nearly $11 million in his coffers compared with Bush's $10 million. But about $1 million of Rubio's cash cannot be accessed unless he wins the GOP nomination, a point Bush campaign spokesman Tim Miller pounced on via Twitter.\n\"Lying about budgets. Guess Marco picked up something in the Senate,\" Miller tweeted Friday.\nRubio's campaign reported raising $5.7 million from July through September, down from $9 million in the three months prior. Bush's team says that shows Rubio has been losing steam.\nYet Bush advisers are clearly put off by the senator's durability. Hopes have not come to pass that rivals could be chased from the field with Bush's mammoth fundraising effort in the first half of the year — yielding more than $100 million for his campaign and the super PAC supporting him.\nThey are competing for many of the same voters. Each has won statewide election — Bush twice, Rubio once — in Florida, a hefty prize in the presidential election.\nThey also have pull among Latino voters, whom Republicans want to draw away from Democrats.
