(Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette) Most Popular Douglas Miles , The Gazette October 1, 2015 | 11:07 pm \nCEDAR RAPIDS — As the Indoor Football League free agency period begins to heat up, the Cedar Rapids Titans have solidified who will continue to guide their personnel. \nCedar Rapids Coach Mark Stoute, who has a 29-16 record and three playoff appearances in three seasons with the Titans, signed a two-year extension Thursday that will keep the coaching veteran in Cedar Rapids through the 2017 season. \nLongtime Stoute assistant Michael Custer also returns as assistant head coach and special teams coordinator. \nA new addition to the coaching staff is offensive coordinator Dixie Wooten, who coached the Bemidji Axemen last season. \nStoute will continue to be tasked with club personnel decisions, which took an interesting turn Thursday with word that a trade was in the works that would send Cedar Rapids receiver Bryan Pray to the Green Bay Blizzard. The 5-foot-7 Pray caught 131 passes for 1,830 yards and 38 touchdowns in three seasons in Cedar Rapids. Before that, Pray was a member of the Green Bay Blizzard and a trade would return him to the state of Wisconsin, where he makes his home. \nPray would join another former Cedar Rapids player — defensive back Keith Holliday — who agreed to sign with the Blizzard in mid-September. \nPray is the second high-profile Titan to be dealt this offseason. Kicker Rockne Belonte was traded to the Wichita Falls Nighthawks last month in exchange for linebacker James Ackel. That move allowed Belmonte to be closer to his new home in Lawton, Okla. \nThe 2016 season kicks off in February. \nHere is the official press release from the club: \nSTOUTE SIGNS CONTRACT EXTENSION \nTITANS ANNOUNCE 2016 COACHING STAFF \nCEDAR RAPIDS, IA: Since Mark Stoute became the head coach of the Cedar Rapids Titans in 2013 he has demonstrated a strong commitment to Titans season ticket holders, sponsors, fans and the city of Cedar Rapids; the commitment of winning. The biggest off season priority of Titans Co-Owner/General Manager Chris Kokalis was to ensure Stoute returned in 2016. Kokalis announced on Tuesday that the team has come to terms with Stoute for the 2016 and 2017 seasons. \nIn his three years with the Titans, Stoute has compiled a 29-12 record and has lead the Titans to the IFL United Conference Championship game in all three seasons.

Throughout his career he has assisted players in moving to higher levels including the Canadian Football League and National Football League. “He’s a winner,” said Kokalis in regards to Stoute’s extension. “He wants to finish what he started here in Cedar Rapids and bring a Championship to the community. He has been instrumental in assisting our players in getting opportunities at higher levels which is what the league is all about.” \nAlong with Stoute’s extension, the Titans also announced the rest of the team’s 2016 coaching staff. Michael Custer returns for his fourth season with the Titans as the team’s Assistant Head Coach & Special Team’s Coordinator and 2nd year coach JD Van Fleet will return as an assistant coach. The Titans have a new addition to the coaching staff in IFL veteran Dixie Wooten. \nWooten joins the Titans staff as offensive coordinator after spending the past two seasons with the Bemidji Axemen.
