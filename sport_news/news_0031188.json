It's early in the year; we have a good foundation, but there's a lot of things we still want to build and improve, and we'll use Sunday and Monday to slowly address some of those.\" \nThe Flyers' challenge when they return Tuesday: Avoid looking rusty, a development that occurred frequently after long layoffs last season. \n\"We just have to work hard in practice. Practice with a high tempo. A lot of battle drills, five-on-five drills, and game situations,\" center Sean Couturier said. \"Everything we do out there has to be with a purpose related to the game. I think we'll be ready.\" \nRight winger Jake Voracek said the Flyers \"can't panic\" if they look rusty early in Tuesday's game. \"If you have five days without a game, that first 20 minutes [back], you have to make sure you pay attention to the details. Game tempo has nothing to do with practice tempo. We have to stay patient like we did the last two games and find a way to win the game. It doesn't matter how.\" \nBreakaways. Prior to participating in the Flyers' Charities 5K run on Saturday, Jackie Lithgow was given the team's seventh-man award by coach Dave Hakstol for his relentless spirit. Last year, Lithgow was critically injured breaking up a fight at an off-campus Bloomsburg University fraternity party. He underwent at least six skull operations and overcame meningitis and MRSA. . . . The Flyers are averaging just 1.75 goals per game (25th in the league entering Saturday) and allowing 2.50 goals per game (tied for 11th). . . . If he plays Tuesday, R.J. Umberger will try to snap a career-high 20-game goalless streak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:02:43.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
