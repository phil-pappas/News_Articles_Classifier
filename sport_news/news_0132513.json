But nobody was overlooking the Central defense on Friday night. Time after time, the Knights stopped Woonsocket scoring chances, including two inside their 20-yard line and again on four plays from their 30 in the final minute of the game, enabling undefeated Central to hold on for a 13-8 triumph at Conley Stadium. The victory upped Central's Division II-A record to 3-0 and their overall slate to 4-0. “Our defense played very big tonight,” said Central coach Pete Rios. Rios’ high praise may even be an understatement. Central jumped out to a 13-0 lead in the first half, as its defense blanked Woonsocket. But it was in the second half that Central was really tested as the Knights' defense twice kept the Villa Novans out of the end zone in the third quarter after they had taken possession deep in Central territory after a blocked punt and a bad Central snap on another punt attempt. The blocked punt had given Woonsocket the ball on the Central 3-yard line, but the Knights gave up only a yard on four plays. A few minutes later, after the bad snap, the Villa Novans had the ball on the Central 20. This time, aided by a Woonsocket penalty, the Knights held the Novans to a minus-15 yards. Woonsocket finally managed to get in the end zone when it took advantage of good field position because of a short Central punt. Quarterback Hunter Oppenheim fired a 10-yard touchdown pass to Ke’Vaughn Davis, and Renalo Johnson rushed for the conversion, cutting the Woonsocket deficit to five points with eight minutes to play. The Central defense stopped Woonsocket (1-2, 0-2 Division II-A) on four plays the next time the Villa Novans had the ball and it looked like the Knights were going to ride out the game easily as they picked up two first downs and moved the ball inside the Woonsocket 30 with just over a minute to play. But Woonsocket forced a fumble, giving the Villa Novans one more chance. A couple of Oppenheim passes gave Woonsocket a first down on the Central 30 with 23 seconds to play. But Central delivered one more big effort, stopping four Woonsocket pass attempts. “Our defense has been playing great all season,” said Rios. “I told our defense today that we know we can score points, but can we stop Woonsocket? We knew Woonsocket was going to be tough.” Early in the game, it looked like Central was headed to victory the way the Knights had done it each week this season — behind the running of Tyrone Silva. Page 2 of 2 - The senior running back, who had come into the game with 11 touchdowns in the first three games, gave the Knights the lead only four minutes after the start of the game when he raced 10 yards for a touchdown. But the combination of a wet field and a Woonsocket defense geared to stopping Silva kept the Knights star under wraps throughout most of the game. “We knew they would defend No. 2,\" Rios said of Silva. “They know he is our workhorse and they had to stop the workhorse. They put nine or 10 guys in the box.” The Knights picked up what proved to be their margin of victory with seven minutes to play in the first half when Tony Reeves picked up a punt and returned it 37 yards for a touchdown. “We were fortunate to come away with a win, but we will take being 3-0 in this division,\" said Rios.
