The splendid 22-run victory in Indore on October 14 was a shot in the arm for not only the team but also under-fire captain MS Dhoni after they lost the series-opener in Kanpur. The victory in Indore helped India halt South Africa’s three-match winning run on their tour, the visitors’ other two victories having come in the T20I series held prior to the ODI contest. While Dhoni’s return to form is a big plus for the team, the lack of runs from the blade of Virat Kohli, as also of the two other key members — Suresh Raina and Shikhar Dhawan — could be a bit worrying for the hosts. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar said the match-winning knock by skipper Dhoni boosted the bowlers’ confidence that they could set up a win. “The atmosphere was always normal even when we were not winning matches. But after the victory in the last match, there is certainly a positive vibe in the team. Dhoni’s knock gave the team a lot of confidence in the previous game. But in that game a lot of our bowlers also faced close to 25-30 balls which helped them to figure out how the pitch was playing.” Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) pitch curator Rasik Makwana said the track would offer lot of runs and the dew factor would be minimal in the prevailing conditions. SA let momentum go\nSouth African batsman Faf du Plessis said his team has let some of its own momentum pass and allowed India to gain in confidence by committing tactical errors. “That’s the most disappointing thing from the team’s perspective. We had India on the ropes. We got nice momentum behind us, but now we have given them a sniff,” said Du Plessis. — PTI 12 ODI innings without a half-century make 2015 the leanest year of Virat Kohli's fifty-over career so far.
