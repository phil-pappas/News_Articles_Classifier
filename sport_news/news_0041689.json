That game we played all the rugby, but it was scoreboard pressure. \n“That’s the biggest thing that we learnt. It doesn’t matter how much rugby you play, if you don’t build scoreboard pressure on the opposition then you end up losing the match. \n“Hopefully for us, we don’t have a repeat of that for this quarter-final.” \nNo side have won the World Cup after losing a pool game and South Africa started the tournament with a stunning 34-32 defeat by Japan. \nYet they bounced back to top Pool B and rounded off the group phase with a 64-0 thrashing of the United States at London Olympic Stadium last week. \n“It’s been like my career with ups and downs,” said Burger, who years ago survived a potentially fatal bacterial meningitis infection. \n“We started with the most famous loss in World Cup history against Japan and after that the next two weeks were probably my toughest as a Springbok. \n“Coming back to win against Samoa and Scotland, luckily enough we turned the corner, and topped our group. \n“What’s important about this group is we have pressed the reset button after we had that loss and now we have to concentrate on winning a quarter-final.” \nWales, who beat South Africa in Cardiff in November, have been hard hit by injuries. \nBut Burger warned that Wales, beaten semi-finalists at the 2011 World Cup, are well-drilled by coach Warren Gatland. \n“Most teams have picked up injuries during this World Cup but if you look at the way they play, they’re still working their systems,” said Burger. “That’s what protects you as a player.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:13:34.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
