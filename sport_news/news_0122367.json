I've prepared for it.\" \nGolub has been playing football since middle school and concentrated on long snapping to reach his goal of playing collegiately. \n\"He just works as hard as he can ... and you reward that hard work,\" Tulane coach Curtis Johnson said. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
