He served as FIFA's secretary general from 1998 to 2002.\nFIFA is due to choose a successor to Sepp Blatter at an extraordinary Congress on Feb. 26.\nEmbroiled in a corruption scandal, Blatter was suspended for 90 days by FIFA's ethics committee on Thursday along with UEFA president Michel Platini, pending a full investigation. Until recently, Platini had been the favourite to replace Blatter.\n(Writing by Brian Homewood in Berne, editing by Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:51:10.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
