The 24-year-old forward was a target for both Norwich and Bristol City in the transfer window but remained at Selhurst Park 02 October 2015 03:00 AM\nThe 24-year-old forward was a target for both Norwich and Bristol City in the transfer window but remained at Selhurst Park.\nGayle grabbed a hat-trick in the 4-1 Capital One Cup win at Charlton and impressed when drafted into the attack for the Premier League game against Watford, where Palace won 1-0.\nPardew indicated Gayle would be in his plans for tomorrow's lunchtime kick-off against West Brom, when former Eagles boss Tony Pulis returns to Selhurst Park. However, when asked whether the player was set for a new deal, Pardew said: \"It's not something I'm aware of.\n\"We obviously have to keep an eye on players' contracts as they run down, but I think we are pretty comfortable where we are.\n\"Signing Yannick (Bolasie) was a real boost for us and having key players under long contracts bodes well for going forwards.\"\nThe Eagles boss continued: \"I was very impressed with him (Gayle) last Sunday. If he had scored two goals he would have been man of the match, and he could have, he was so unlucky with a couple of chances. That is what he gives us and he has worked his way into the team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:18:49.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
