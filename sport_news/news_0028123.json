In front of an enthusiastic crowd, including many supporters from TOYOTA Motor Corporation, the two TS040 HYBRIDs were significantly more competitive in the wet weather conditions early in the race. But incidents for both cars and a relative lack of pace in dry conditions caused frustration. The #1 TS040 HYBRID of Anthony Davidson, Sébastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima finished fifth after a drive-through penalty ended its battle for the top four. The #2 of Alex Wurz, Stéphane Sarrazin and Mike Conway needed a lengthy repair stop after being hit by a GT car and fought back to finish sixth. The first 40 minutes took place behind the safety car on a wet track with rain still falling. Kazuki and Alex started in fifth and sixth respectively. When racing did begin, a hectic start saw Kazuki in third, while Alex held fourth before falling back to sixth despite a gallant fight. Kazukis battle with the #17 Porsche was a highlight of the race as he showed immense fighting spirit to trade places before ultimately dropping to fourth shortly before the hour mark. The first pit stops left the #1 in fifth, one place ahead of the #2. As the rain eased Anthony closed on the fourth-placed #8 Audi, with the TS040 HYBRID performing strongly in the damp conditions. With the track drying, both cars changed to hybrid intermediate tyres but TOYOTAs race chances were dealt two blows soon after. First, Stéphane was hit by a GT car, damaging the cooling system and requiring a 13-minute stop for repairs. Mike rejoined in the #2 in 19th place, 12 laps down. At the same time, Anthony was given a drive-through penalty for a pit lane entry infringement. With conditions improving, both cars switched to dry tyres for the final quarter of the race. By that time Sébastien was at the wheel of the #1 in fifth place, while Mike had made his way into the top eight. Home hero Kazuki took the wheel of the #1 for the final stint and crossed the line in fifth place, while Alex continued progress for the #2 and reclaimed sixth position in the closing minutes. TOYOTA remains third in the manufacturers World Championship, 145 points behind leaders Porsche, who won the race with the #17 car. Only t TS040 HYBRID #1 (Anthony Davidson, Sébastien Buemi, Kazuki Nakajima) Kazuki Nakajima: As we expected, in the wet conditions we were more competitive. I had a fun fight early in the race with the Porsches; it was difficult to keep ahead because they had more straight line speed. Somehow I stayed ahead of one Porsche until my pit stop; it was exciting. After that the others were a bit faster.
