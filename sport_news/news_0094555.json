With the likes of Sudha Singh and Lalita Babar in the entry list, there seemed to be plenty on offer for the fans but both the athletes, trainees of Nikolai Snesarev, have decided to stay away.“The coach has asked us not to take part as we have not recovered properly from previous competitions,” Sudha said. “He has asked us to focus instead on the Delhi half-marathon next month. It has been a very busy time for us and he doesn’t want us to get injured,” she said. Sudha, winner of the half-marathon here last year, had finished 19th at the World Championships while she also competed in the Open Nationals last month. Lalita had caught the attention of the world, entering the final of the 3000M steeplechase in Beijing. She also competed in the Open Nationals, leaving her with very little recovery time.In their absence, Tamil Nadu’s Suriya Loganathan, who has made a name for herself in the 5000M and 10000M events at the national level, will be the fancied name in the half-marathon. Kavita Raut was a prominent name in the women’s full marathon but even she has decided to withdraw. B C Tilak and Binning Lyngkhoi figure among the contenders in the men’s full marathon. Meanwhile, after their tough experience in the inaugural edition of the event, especially with regard to the traffic, the organisers have promised a better show this time. “Close to 7000 runners have registered for half-marathon and 2000 for the full marathon,” Race Director Nagaraj Adiga said. The mass run segment, called the 5k Hope Run, has drawn 6000 runners, he added.A total prize fund of Rs 40 lakh is on offer across all segments, with the top three in the elite full-marathon taking home Rs 1,50,000, Rs 100,000 and Rs 75,000 respectively. The prize money for the top three in the elite half-marathon will be Rs 75,000, Rs 50,000 and Rs 30,000. There will be prize money up to the fifth place, with different age group toppers also eligible for a share of the purse.Former international athlete Reeth Abraham, the brand ambassador of the event, admitted that traffic will pose a major challenge. She said better arrangements have been put in place this time and urged the Bengalureans to come out and support the athletes. An early start also could ease the worries, with the full marathon kicking off the proceedings at 4.40 am at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium, which will also be the finishing point.The half-marathoners will return to the stadium after the Ulsoor lake point while the Hope run will mainly be inside the Cubbon Park.
