The North Carolina State Fair is in town this week, featuring an assortment of amusement rides like the Zipper, Crazy Chopper, Swinging Pirate Ship and the Super Cyclone Coaster. They're all fun, but none of them can match the up and down thrills you'll get from \"The 'Quise\" in Chapel Hill. \nNorth Carolina has been an offensive roller coaster this season with quarterback Marquise Williams at the controls and Saturday's 50-14 win over Wake Forest was no different. The Tar Heels found themselves in an early hole after a miscommunication resulted in an interception and a tipped pass at the line turned into another. Once the offense settled down in the second quarter, North Carolina put four touchdowns on the board before halftime and never looked back. @joeovies the best version of the UNC offense has Quise at QB. Also the worst version of the UNC offense has Quise at QB — John (@JTobben) October 17, 2015 \nWilliams threw for 282 yards and three touchdowns before ending his night early. All three touchdowns, including a gorgeous 57-yarder in the second half, were thrown in Mack Hollins. Williams had an additional touchdown on the ground. \nAnd speaking of the ground game, running back Elijah Hood averaged 12.6 yards per carry on his way to 101 yards against the Demon Deacons. \nAn overall impressive performance by the Tar Heels against a Wake Forest defense that has done a good job slowing down opponents throughout the season, including their bizarre 3-0 win over Boston College last week. Congratulations in advance, UNC. You just won the game because Wake scored a touchdown — Lauren Brownlow (@lebrownlow) October 17, 2015 \n2. North Carolina is now 5-1 overall and 2-0 in the ACC, with another highly winnable game next Saturday against Virginia. The Tar Heels then hit a critical Coastal Division stretch against Pittsburgh (3-0 after edging out Georgia Tech), Duke (2-0 after a bye) and Miami (1-1 after beating Virginia Tech). \n3. I hate talking about officiating. Seriously, I really do, but the ACC has done one helluva job this season giving me no choice but to highlight some head-scratching decisions. I've already had to unlearn what classifies as holding and reconsider my understanding of spacial awareness for things like 4th down measurements in previous weeks. Now I must reassess my aptitude for recognizing fair catch signals. \nIn the third quarter, Ryan Switzer caught a punt in traffic and returned it 70 yards. Or did he? \nSwitzer's body language fooled Wake's special teams into thinking he was going to signal for a fair catch, but he never actually motioned for it. His trick was so good that it also duped officials, who blew the play dead. Switzer was eventually flagged for a delay of game, since the returner isn't allowed to advance the ball a fair catch. \nIronically, the refs insisted on a fair catch and failed to flag catch interference after a Demon Deacon defender bumped into Switzer. \n4. Oh, you thought North Carolina was going to forget some shade thrown by Wake Forest assistant coach Adam Scheier earlier this year? Think again. \nFor context, Scheier referenced North Carolina's academic scandal in a snarky tweet on National Signing Day in February. The tweet was deleted and passed off as an obvious joke, but the internet never forgets. \nSwitzer wasn't available to the media after the game, but said everything he needed to about the win with a white board on the sideline. — Ryan Switzer (@Switz03) October 18, 2015 Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:44:01.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
