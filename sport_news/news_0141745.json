Can he lead a team? Can he stand strong in the pocket? Can he prolong a play? Can he avoid a pass rush? Can he scramble and run for a first down? \nRoxbury quarterback Grant Dixon can put a check mark next to all of these qualities. Not a few of them. All of them. \nOkay, now onto intangibles: Is he big enough? Fast enough? Is he coachable? Is he a winner? Popular with his teammates? Does he have good grades? \nDixon makes the grade in all of those as well. \nSo, why hasn't he gotten a single scholarship offer? Worse yet, even losing programs have not offered. \nGaels coach Cosmo Lorusso scratches his head every day. Lorusso has coached high school football for 20 years, has sent many players to play college football at both Roxbury and Pequannock and knows how to get a college recruiter's ear. \nLorusso has sent tape of Dixon everywhere up and down the East Coast, from Coastal Carolina to Maine to everywhere in between, places like Lafayette, Colgate, Wagner, and Monmouth. \nLorusso urges anyone who will listen to find Dixon's impressive Hudl highlights and give a look. \n\"It baffles me, it baffles my whole staff,\" Lorusso said. \"Some of these schools that haven't offered him anything, we're like ... 'Are you kidding me?'\" \nThey must be. Lorusso said recruiters have told him that Dixon not getting an offer stems from a technical flaw in his throwing motion. The only problem is: Lorusso is not buying it. He cannot detect it, and neither can Dixon. \n\"I don't know what they're talking about,\" Lorusso said. \"And if there was something wrong, is there someone who can figure it out and fix what they think is wrong? \nDixon spent much of his summer throwing at camps run by Colgate, Villanova, Wagner, Rhode Island and Rutgers. The Rutgers camp had coaches from Delaware, New Hampshire and Monmouth on hand. Since last season ended, some 1AA schools have come by Roxbury to watch Dixon throw. \nOne of them, after Dixon completed every pass he threw to teammate Jack Clevenger, said, \"If I could, I'd offer you a scholarship right now!\" \nThat coach then invited Dixon to throw at his school. Dixon went, but so did 15-16 other QBs. He performed well, but that same coach who invited him seemed withdrawn and distant. \nAnd no scholarship was offered. \nSometimes, the recruiters would try and have Dixon adjust his mechanics at their camp. Dixon would try but then decided to go back to his way. \n\"I've had too much success to change anything,\" he said. \"They'll say, 'You throw a good ball, but why don't you bring your arm down. Do this, do that. I'll end up thinking, 'Changing is not worth it, so why change it?'\" \nWhy fix what's not broken? Dixon was the Daily Record's Player of the Year last year after he threw for 2,270 yards and 27 TDs and rushed for another 564 yards and five more TDs in leading the Gaels to the North 1, Group IV semifinals. \nThis year, he has led the Gaels to a 4-0 record and the No. 9 spot in one newspaper's state-wide ranking. He is as good a two-way threat at the position as you'll find on a high school football field. He has a 3.8 GPA and visited Princeton last week. \n\"I can't let it bother me,\" he said. \"I can't make a team want me. I cannot take it personally. I told coach (Lorusso), 'All I care about is our season and winning games.'\" \nAs great as Dixon was last year, he is every bit as good this season. He is coming off a 38-7 victory over Morristown Saturday and was his usual terrific self as a thrower and runner. He was 22 for 33 passing for 208 yards and two touchdowns and rushed 12 times for 69 yards and another score. \nFor the season, he is 73 for 110 passing for 932 yards and eight touchdowns while rushing 45 times for 260 more yards and four TDs. He has yet to throw a single interception in 2015. \n\"He's great every single game,\" Lorusso said. \"He's just phenomenal. There's nothing wrong with his throwing motion. Just look at the results. Some guys have a weird batting stance or golf swing, but he doesn't. I just watched the Utah QB (Travis Wilson) put up 60 points on Oregon and he has a different kind of throwing motion, but that didn't stop him.\" \nLorusso hopes Dixon turns into another Michael Burton, who was a Daily Record Player of the Year out of West Morris, walked on at Rutgers, became a Scarlet Knights captain, and is now a member of the NFL's Detroit Lions. Dixon has been invited to walk on at Penn State. \n\"Recruiters said to me last year in the spring, 'He's a scholarship player,'\" Lorusso said. \nThus far, the only school that has shown any interest is Division 2 West Chester. Dixon is interested in West Chester, but Lorusso believes his quarterback not getting more interest is insulting. \n\"I've seen college quarterbacks on TV who are awful,\" Lorusso said. \"I saw a starting quarterback go down recently, and the backup came in and he couldn't throw at all. He was bad. But Grant can throw very well, he keeps plays alive, he reads defenses, and he does it against great competition. He threw for over 300 yards against Delbarton last year.\" \nAt his job working behind the counter at Roxbury Bagels, Dixon is constantly asked about his college plans. He doesn't have an answer yet. \n\"I don't want to let it bother me,\" he said. \"It bothers me sometimes, but that makes me work harder to improve week after week.\" \n\"I'll tell you what's gonna happen,\" Lorusso said. \"Someone's gonna wind up taking him and there gonna get someone who's really special. \" \nBut the big question is, when? And who? And is anyone even contemplating an offer? \nAs Dixon said, \"The clock is ticking. I have until February.\" \nNational Letter of Intent Day for football is Feb. 3. Until then, Dixon waits patiently, wondering what a high school quarterback has to do to earn a college scholarship. \nDaily Record Top 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:16:13.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
