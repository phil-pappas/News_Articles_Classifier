Close Coast Guard tops MIT 28-13 to remain unbeaten in NEFC Coast Guard Academy quarterback Derek Victory (9) celebrates after scoring the Bears' first offensive touchdown against MIT in Saturday's New England Football Conference game at Cadet Memorial Field in New London. The Bears beat the Engineers on Homecoming Day 28-13. (Sean D. Elliot/The Day) Published October 17. 2015 7:39PM By Vickie Fulkerson \nNew London — Coast Guard was playing a team, MIT, with a 200-yard rusher, a team which compiled more than 500 yards offense and which was picked to finish first in the New England Football Conference this season. \nAnd yet here's how the Bears defeated MIT 28-13 to cap off Saturday's homecoming celebration before 2,986 fans at the academy: An interception return for a touchdown, a blocked field goal — both by Joe Rizzardi — a career-high 134 yards rushing from Mike Clancy, quarterback Derek Victory's continued interception-free streak and the booming punts of Tyler Henning. \nA little of this. A little of that. \nAnd there's the Coast Guard Academy football team (picked to finish sixth), 4-2 overall and tied for first place in the NEFC with Western New England at 3-0. \n“Football is a much more complicated game than people give it credit for,” Coast Guard coach Bill George said. “It's not some archaic game where guys are beating each other up. The blocked kick was a factor. The special teams came up big. \n“We've pounded it into this team that we can beat teams by one, but every game is a football game. We are Coast Guard. We're not Ohio State. We have to win football games. They don't get won for us.” \nCoast Guard trailed 3-0 in the first quarter when Rizzardi put the Bears ahead to stay with a 16-yard interception return for a touchdown. \nAnother MIT field goal made it 7-6, but Coast Guard then executed a 14-play drive, covering 81 yards and capped by a 1-yard sneak from Victory. The big play on the series was a 45-yard completion from Victory to tight end Cody Bain, who got behind the defense. \nCoast Guard led 14-13 at halftime. \n“I was in my spot doing my job. That's how the defense is so successful,” said Rizzardi, the Bears' senior strong safety, of the interception. “He kind of tipped it and I caught it right in my breadbasket … I haven't had a pick six since my sophomore year.” \nThe Bears picked up steam in the second half, when Clancy rushed for 106 yards and the defense shut out the Engineers. \nCoast Guard got the ball to start the third quarter and scored, aided by a roughing the kicker penalty that negated a 67-yard punt by Henning. Clancy ran for 18 yards and Victory hit Bain for 14 on the right sideline before Victory threw a reverse screen to Kyle Jackson, rolling left and throwing right for a 25-yard touchdown. \nMIT fumbled on its next series, recovered by Coast Guard's Mark Behne, then came a Henning punt that was downed at the MIT 6 and Rizzardi's block on the Engineers' ensuing 25-yard field goal attempt. Henning's next punt landed at the 3; he had five overall that fell inside the 20. \nClancy scored on a 10-yard touchdown run with 11:09 remaining in the game for the 28-13 lead. \nMIT, which got 208 yards rushing from freshman Adis Ojeda, was penalized 11 times for 110 yards, however. \n“Absolutely, he's the fire for our team,” Rizzardi said of Henning. “No matter what offense you have, teams have to go 90 yards for a touchdown.” \nRizzardi said his love for special teams comes from his high school days in Ashburn, Va., when he had to work to break into the starting lineup but got to play on special teams. \n“I always made an effort to make a play on special teams,” Rizzardi said. “My high school coach used to call it 'hidden yardage.'” \nLinebacker Ed Lazowski led the team with eight tackles and also had an interception. Victory, who has now gone 145 passing attempts without an interception, was 13-for-24 for 168 yards and a touchdown. Jackson had four catches for 56 yards and Bain had three catches for 66. \nCoast Guard was averaging just 65.4 yards rushing entering the game, but finished with 204 against MIT (1-5, 1-2). \n“I think we tried to do the same things we always do,” Clancy said. “They were the same plays we put in back in August. The line had a great day. … I just think we have a lot of hope right now. We're pretty excited about the way things are going. It feels good.” \nv.fulkerson@theday.com \nTwitter: @vickieattheday Coast Guard's Paul Puddington (48) stops MIT's Adis Ojeda (44) during the Bears' 28-13 victory over the Engineers in Saturday's New England Football Conference game at Cadet Memorial Field in New London.
