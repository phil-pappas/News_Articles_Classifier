Any such appeal would be heard by an independent panel.\" \nCellino later released a statement to Sky Sports News confirming an appeal would be lodged. It read: \"I'm very confused, I'm very angry. I'll be fighting the ban any how and any way, and I'll be appealing.\" \nThe news overshadowed a plea from Evans to those Leeds fans unhappy with Rosler's departure and the prospect of a sixth new manager since Cellino took control at Elland Road. \nThe Scot, who took Rotherham into the Championship and kept them there before his surprise departure last month, said: \"There are very few times I'm lost for words - you guys know me - but I'm lost for words. \n\"I'm very humbled - a boy from a council estate near Glasgow is Leeds manager. Where that goes we'll see - I need to win some football matches. \n\"It's a massive task - there are some great football managers who've not been able to get this club to win football matches, but dare I say there were some great managers at Rotherham trying to win matches before my time. \n\"I work hard and give it everything I've got, and all I can ask of the Leeds supporters - and there are millions of them worldwide - is just give me the opportunity to win some football matches. I know the consequences if I don't.\" \nEvans revealed Cellino first approached him on Saturday, when Brighton's win at Elland Road made it four defeats in five for Rosler's side. \n\"We spent a lot of time yesterday [Sunday] after first contact was made on Saturday,\" he said. \"Everyone knows his enthusiasm and his love and his passion for the football club to win matches. \n\"I have to win matches, that's what he's said. We've not won a home fixture for almost seven months - that's not acceptable for any football club.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:14:37.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
