The first came late in the third quarter by Selinsgrove coach Derek Hicks. The Seals trailed 14-10 when they recovered a fumble deep in their own territory. Selinsgrove drove into Berwick territory, but opted to put on a fourth-and-one from the Berwick 40. The next two came by coach George Curry and the Bulldogs. The first came on their ensuing drive when Berwick was faced with a fourth-and-inches from its own 18. First Berwick tried to draw the Seals offside, then called a timeout. Selinsgrove was forced to take a timeout when they sent the punt team out, after the Berwick timeout. The Bulldogs finally ran Alex Koch for three yards and the first down. The Bulldogs were unable to convert another first down on the drive and kicked the ball away. Curry made another intresting choice with 5:34 left in the game. Facing a third-and-seven, Anthony Cicini was stopped a yard short on a run play, but the Bulldogs elected to go for it from their own 40 and try to clinch the victory. The Seals were ready and Andrew Boob knifed through the line to stop Cicini for a yard loss and give Selinsgrove’s offense a chance to win the game. Chance to shine: Line Mountain was dealt a crippling blow when standout junior tailback Kenny Boyer was lost to a severe knee injury a few weeks ago. Boyer, who rushed for nearly 800 yards and 11 touchdowns in 2014, was expected to the be the centerpiece of the Eagles’ offense. He went for 203 yards in the season-opener, but was injured and missed the last two games. Line Mountain leaned on fullback Brent Osman (89 yards) in a loss to Juniata, but Friday they gave freshman Breven Derk a heavy workload in his varsity debut. Derk, a 5-foot-9, 140-pound receiver, shifted to the backfield and immediately gave the Eagles an added speed element. He ran for 33 yards and three first downs on his first six carries before losing a fumble while attempting to leap for extra yards. He was slowed a bit by the slick field and Tri-Valley’s swarming defense — and fumbled again early in the fourth quarter — but he finished with 47 yards rushing, including seven gains of 5 or more yards. \"Breven is a building block moving forward,\" said Eagles coach Rodney Knock. \"It’s a kid that never played tailback before, thrown in there this week, and, for the most part — other than the turnovers — he did a decent job running the football. \"But that’s the case across the board. We’ve got so many injuries — which isn’t an excuse — but we’ve got guys, freshmen and sophomores, who are getting their feet wet. I thought the younger kids played very well for being thrust in there for pretty much their first varsity experience.\" Looking ahead, not back: The big question tossed around the press box Friday at Glenn Ressler Field was, ‘When is the last time Line Mountain was 0-5?\" There was no ready answer, and some wondered if perhaps since 1966, when the Mahanoy Joint and Trevorton districts merged to form Line Mountain. Knock wasn’t interested in 50-year history, or even four-week history, opting instead to focus on the future. None of the remaining teams on the Eagles’ schedule has a winning record. In fact, they are a combined 7-18. \"I said in the huddle afterwards, ‘That’s half of our season. It’s over with. We’re not even going to think about it. We’re going to learn from our mistakes from this game, and we’re going to play the next five games like it’s a new season,’\" said Knock. \"Yes, our schedule is a little more favorable moving forward, but our goal is just to get better, execute and not make the costly mistakes we’ve been making. Get better every single day — that’s all we can do.\" Wind aided and not: Even though there was no rain Friday night at Hughesville, there was plenty of wind and it played a major role in a series of plays. First, Warrior Run stopped the Spartans offense and forced a punt. But with the wind at his back and two very good bounces, Melvin Derhammer uncorked a 74 yard punt that put the Defenders inside their own five. Moments later, Warrior Run had to punt into the wind and it didn’t go well and gave the Spartans the ball inside the 30. But with time running down and all the evidence about the wind right in front of them, Hughesville decided to not call timeout facing a fourth down and then tried a field goal at the start of the fourth into the wind. The 37-yard attempt failed. New look: A necessary quarterback change at Mount Carmel led to the Red Tornadoes’ unveiling a new offense Friday night against Danville. The Red Tornadoes took advantage of the talents of senior tailback Kyle Karycki and, for most of the game, ran the wildcat formation with Karycki taking the direct snap and then picking his way through the   school single-game record 368 rushing yards. The change was prompted by the injury to starting quarterback freshman John Ayres. With Ayres sidelined, sophomore Tommy McDonald got his first start. Karycki said, \"We put that in coming in this week. We knew we had to do something for Johnny being out. Tommy did a good job, but the wildcat just helped us open up a lot of run plays that are meant for it.\" Karycki said he couldn’t have done what he did without the play of his line, and some mid-week advice from his coaches. \"It was kind of tough to do (at first). During practice, we were running the wildcat, and I was busting up through the holes and the blocks weren’t developing right.\" But he said head coach John Darrah and assistant coach Marc Persing told him \"you have to slow it down, take a shuffle step, let the blocks develop, let them get out in front of you and just hit the holes as hard as you can.\" That’s what he did for most of the plays, except for two. On his TD runs of 66 and 69 yards, he took advantage of run blitzes by Danville and an empty field in the secondary to run away from the defense. McDonald only completed two passes, but both were key. He connected on back-to-back passes of 27 and 15 yards to Lane Tanney and Wes Shurock to keep a first-half drive alive. Up in the air: Mount Carmel coach John Darrah said that the status of his quarterback remains a question mark. \"(Ayres) is day to day right now,\" Darrah said after the game.
