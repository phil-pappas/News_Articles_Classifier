In fact, for a league notorious for three-game weekends, Binghamton doesn't get one of those until the first week of November. \nSo, the Sens may not have the game time to build any early momentum. but they'll try to take care of that during the time they get in practice. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \n\"There's a few things, obviously, that can be worked on,\" said goalie Chris Dreidger, who allowed just one goal in Binghamton's 4-1 win over the Devils. \n\"That's still our first game of the year, so it's a good time to get in those practice hours. Luke knows what he's doing out there and he'll whip us into shape and work out the kinks.\" \n\"I think we've just got to go hard in practice,\" said center Eric O'Dell, who scored two goals in the win. 'I know the past week our practices have been pretty tough. We're doing a lot of skating, a lot of in-zone stuff and it definitely showed tonight. I think we'll be doing a lot of that this week, as well, and I look forward to next week.\" To submit a comment on this article, your email address is required.
