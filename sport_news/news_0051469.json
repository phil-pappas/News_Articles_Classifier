Yahoo said Monday that 15.2 million unique viewers watched for any length of time. About a third of the audience was international. \nBecause Sunday's experiment was the first of its kind, there isn't an easy comparison between the streaming numbers and any previous sports broadcasts. \nJacksonville's wild 34-31 win over Buffalo on Sunday, which started at 9:30 a.m. EDT, was available only through Yahoo worldwide everywhere other than the two home markets, where it was televised on CBS. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:52:56.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
