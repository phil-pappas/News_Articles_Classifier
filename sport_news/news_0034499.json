Florida receiver Antonio Callaway, who had a 72-yard punt return for a score, also had his hands on a long pass to the end zone from Treon Harris in the middle of the fourth quarter, but LSU’s Dwyane Thomas punched it out to prevent a tying touchdown. \nHarris, starting for the suspended Will Grier, passed for 271 yards and two touchdowns for Florida (6-1, 4-1 SEC), with both scoring passes to tight end Jake McGee. Brandon Harris threw for 202 yards and two scores for LSU (6-0, 4-0). \nThe fake field goal had to be a bad case of deja vu for Florida fans, even if not for McElwain, who still probably should have known Miles’ reputation for such gambles. \nIn 2010, LSU completed a fourth-quarter comeback by converting a fake field goal for a first down. Then-kicker Josh Jasper had to scoop the pitch off the ground to complete the play, which allowed the Tigers to score a winning touchdown on a pass from Jarrett Lee to Terrence Toliver in the final seconds. \nThis time, Domingue bobbled the lateral pitch in the air as he ran at full speed, but was able to gather it in as he sprinted around the left end for a go-ahead score. \nFournette finished with 195 yards from scrimmage, including a 15-yard gain on a screen. His rushing total was the highest by any player this season against Florida, eclipsing the 136 yards gained by Tennessee’s Josh Dobbs. The Gators entered the game allowing only 99.2 yards rushing per game. \nLSU also proved it could hit on explosive plays through the air against a strong SEC defense. \nBrandon Harris hit Malachi Dupre, who was covered by Vernon Hargreaves III, for a 52-yard gain on a flea-flicker that began with Fournette taking a pitch from Harris and lateraling the ball back to his quarterback. That play set up Fournette’s second touchdown on a 6-yard run. \nIn the final half-minute of the first half, Brandon Harris escaped Florida defensive end Jordan Sherit’s grasp, and launched a deep pass to Dupre, who made the catch in front of Marcus Maye and scampered a final few yards for a 50-yard TD that made it 28-14 at halftime. That was Dupre’s second touchdown catch of the game. \nFlorida tied the game by outscoring LSU 14-0 in the third quarter. \nA 10-play, 66-yard touchdown drive — highlighted by Treon Harris’ 30-yard completion to tight end DeAndre Goolsby and capped by Kelvin Taylor’s 2-yard run — made it 28-21. \nLater came Callaway’s long punt return — untouched — with 1:04 left in the quarter. \nBut sophomore Treon Harris had a tough task in his eighth career start. Tiger Stadium was packed with more than 102,000 fans amped up for the showdown of old rivals and unbeaten teams. LSU routinely got into the backfield, registering five sacks, three by Lewis Neal. \nStill, Florida wasn’t out of it until Treon Harris’ long desperation throw fell incomplete as time ran out. 3 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE  //on.flatoday.com/1ROUQk6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:04:25.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
