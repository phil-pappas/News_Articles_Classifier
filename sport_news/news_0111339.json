(AP) - Nick Mullens threw touchdown passes to four different receivers and Mike Thomas topped 100 yards receiving for a school-best fifth straight game, leading Southern Mississippi to a 44-10 victory over Charlotte in the first ever matchup of these teams on Saturday. Thomas hauled in a 69-yard pass from Mullens to start the Golden Eagles offensive onslaught, which scored 30 straight points after Charlotte's first-quarter field goal. Thomas finished with six catches for 105 yards. Casey Martin, Korey Robertson and Taylor Marini also had touchdown catches for Southern Mississippi (5-3, 3-1 Conference USA). Charlotte (2-5, 0-4) dropped its fifth straight game. Kalif Phillips rushed for 71 yards on 17 carries after posting a career-best 204 yards in the 49ers' loss to Old Dominion last week. Lee McNeill had a 20-yard touchdown run and finished 10 of 27 for 93 yards and two interceptions. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
