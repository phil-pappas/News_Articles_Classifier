HI had imposed a ban of nine months on Gurbaj after former national coach Jude Felix had submitted a report following the Hockey World League Semifinals in Antwerp, Belgium to the Federation, in which allegations of misbehaviour were made against the veteran midfielder.\nGurbaj had appealed against the disciplinary committee's findings and the matter was heard by a HI committee comprising president Narinder Batra, CEO Elena Norman, Harbinder Singh and RP Singh. However, they were not convinced by the clarification offered by the player. The ban means Gurbaj will miss next year's HIL and Hockey World League (HWL) finals to be held in Raipur, starting November this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:49:04.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
