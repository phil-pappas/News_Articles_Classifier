When Wilson got injured early in the season, Bryson Parks and Hunter Arters ran the huddle. And now that Wilson is back, the Hawks are rotating quarterbacks, and it seems to be working. Arters, who played the majority of the game in Hillgrove’s loss to North Cobb two weeks ago, completed 13 of 16 pass attempts for 263 yards and two touchdowns to lead Cobb County. And in Hillgrove’s region opening win over Marietta three weeks ago, Wilson had his best game of the season upon his return from injury and compiled 218 all-purpose yards and scored four touchdowns. Parks has been used in multiple ways since Wilson has gotten healthy.Hillgrove coach Phil Ironside couldn’t be reached for comment this week regarding the quarterback situation, but it’s likely the Hawks will continue rotating both against Kennesaw Mountain. “They’re doing a good job with the two quarterbacks,” Kennesaw Mountain coach Andy Scott said. “Both are efficient runners and throwers. Their offense doesn’t really change when both of them are in there. They will play fast, they’re a no huddle team and you have to make sure you account for everyone.”Meanwhile, the Mustangs have had a tough start in Region 4 play with losses to North Paulding and Harrison, and Scott said the Mustangs are making too many errors. The Mustangs committed three turnovers against Harrison and it cost them 20 points before falling 41-14 to the Hoyas.“We have to make sure we put ourselves in position to win,” Scott said. The game that we lost the last couple of weeks, we haven’t played well. I think we have to clean up our mental and physical errors and make sure we play better football. If we can do that, we can ourselves in position to win the game.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:11:08.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
