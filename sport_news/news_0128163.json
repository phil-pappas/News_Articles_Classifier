Johnson\n© Nati Harnik/AP Nebraska head coach Mike Riley talks to linebackers coach Trent Bray on the first day of spring NCAA college football practice in Lincoln, Neb., March 7. Every college football season is loaded with surprises. Some of these surprises are pleasant. Others aren’t.\nAdChoices This column focuses on the latter. It includes a list of six teams that simply haven’t measured up to expectations.\nSo, how did I arrive at the number six, instead of my usual seven? The teams on this list would have found a way to shank the extra point and snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory (hopefully, that doesn’t out one of the squads on the list!).\n6. Nebraska — Many will argue that the Cornhuskers don’t belong in such “elite” company. After all, the team has played a tough schedule, and its three losses were by a grand total of nine points. While that’s certainly true, Nebraska isn’t playing like a team that was picked to finish second in the Big Ten West. The Husker D hardly resembles the Blackshirt units of yesteryear, ranking 102nd nationally in total defense, allowing a whopping 438.8 yards per game. To make matters worse, Nebraska gave up a last-minute touchdown to Illinois, which was playing without its top offensive player for the final three quarters. That might not be as painful as losing to Colorado in 2001, but it definitely doesn’t measure up to the program’s lofty standards.\n5. Wyoming — Although no one expected much from the ‘Pokes this year, they were picked to finish fifth in the Mountain Division. However, after watching Wyoming in action the first five weeks, it doesn’t look like the Cowboys are going to win a game. After all, Wyoming has already dropped the most winnable games on the schedule, losing to North Dakota, Eastern Michigan, and New Mexico. The first two losses were incredibly painful to watch, as the Cowboys ran a total of four plays in North Dakota territory in the first three quarters. The team ran for 430 yards against the Eagles from EMU, and still lost by three touchdowns … at home . Yikes!!\n© Darren Carroll/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images Texas head coach Charlie Strong 4. Texas — Did anyone — except some boosters with very unrealistic expectations — think that the ‘Horns were going to win the Big 12 this year? Probably not. Yet, nearly everyone thought that UT would improve on last year’s 6-7 mark. Unfortunately, that hasn’t happened. Sure, the losses to Notre Dame and TCU aren’t exactly a shock. But, the ones to California and Oklahoma State were, as the ‘Horns had a chance to send both games into overtime, yet made a special teams gaffe which cost them the game. Of course, it’s not just the kicking game that’s hurt Texas this year, as the team ranks 120th nationally in total defense and 110th in total offense. Ouch!\n3. Auburn — Many college football writers — myself included — thought that the Tigers were going to make the College Football Playoff this season. With Jeremy Johnson at the controls (a 73-percent career passer, 11 yards per attempt) on offense and Will Muschamp — an architect of top-10 defenses at LSU, Texas, and Florida — back at the school for another turn as defensive coordinator, Auburn seemingly had all of the pieces in place to compete for the SEC title this fall. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out that way. Instead of fielding stellar units, the Tigers rank 109th nationally in total offense and 94th in total defense. As a result of these struggles, Auburn is 0-2 in SEC play with four games remaining against ranked opponents. Although that doesn’t necessarily eliminate them from contention, the odds are about as good as Lloyd Christmas’ . All humor aside, that’s got to be a huge disappointment.\n© Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports George O'Leary's Central Florida football squad certainly has been a major disappointment. 2. Georgia Tech — After finishing the 2014-’15 campaign as one of the hottest teams in college football, many analysts thought that the Jackets would pick up right where they left off last year. That certainly seemed possible after the first two games, as Tech’s offense was absolutely unstoppable against Alcorn State and Tulane. However, the last three games have been a completely different story, as the Jackets haven’t been able to establish the run (3.87 ypc), and have failed to stop the run (611 yards, 6.17 ypc) against Notre Dame, Duke, and North Carolina. The loss to the Tar Heels was an especially difficult pill to swallow, as the Jackets blew an early 21-0 lead. Instead of making a return trip to the ACC Championship Game, Georgia Tech is all but eliminated from the Coastal Division race after just two games. The words “painful” don’t even begin to describe it (although this video might).\n1 – Central Florida — Sadly, the Knights earn this dubious distinction hands down. Yes, the team was due to take a step back this year after losing 13 starters, but most experts felt that UCF had enough talent to compete in the AAC, picking the Knights to finish second behind Cincinnati. Yet, instead of competing, the Knights have me wondering whether or not they’re going to win a game. In the first five games, UCF lost to lightly regarded FIU, Furman (FCS), and Tulane — whose only other win came against Maine. While those brutal defeats are, by themselves, likely enough to capture the “top spot” on this undesirable list, it’s worth noting the offense is the worst in the country (266.4 ypg), and was held to minus-35 yards rushing against Tulane… the same team that gave up 645 yards on the ground in its first two games against Duke and Georgia Tech. No matter whether you use overall records or team stats as your metric, UCF is the biggest disappointment in college football this year.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://youtu.be/hZ17hTauYmI?t=14", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5jNnDMfxA", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:11:49.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
