Photo by Christie M. Farriella The city's girls basketball community has suffered another tragic loss.\nAlexis Smith , a fixture of the girls game and the longtime basketball director at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, died late Monday at his home in Brownsville, Brooklyn, at 48. The cause of death was a heart attack, several people who were close to Smith said.\nSmith’s death came three weeks after that of Apache Paschall , the Nazareth HS girls coach and a staple of the AAU scene.\nSmith was suffering from diabetes and had recently lost all of his vision, according to Banneker HS girls basketball coach Jonathan Anderson , one of Smith’s closest friends in the sport.\nIn addition to his wife, Francina Hockaday-Smith , Smith is survived by the scores of players he helped over the years.\n“He was a father to all the kids in Brownsville,” Anderson said. “All the kids came by his house just to hear Lex laugh. He was a mentor to all the kids in Brownsville.”\nIn 2008, Smith founded and directed the Thelma Smith Foundation, which distributed school supplies and food to children. While tough economic times led to dwindling sponsorship, Smith carried on, even as he started to lose his vision.\nLast August, Smith told the Daily News that his battle with diabetes and the resulting loss of vision was merely a “diversion, another obstacle to overcome.”\n“He was a fighter,” Anderson said. “That didn’t bother him. He kept going. He couldn’t see but he was there.”\nAccording to Anton Marchand , the director of the Rose Classic AAU tournament, Smith was also a mentor to Paschall, who died of a heart attack on Jan. 3.\nMarchand said he considered Smith a friend, having known him for 10 years. They spoke on the phone regularly.\n“He’s another guy we leaned on for advice and guidance in starting up the Rose Classic,” Marchand said of Smith. “I’d always call him and he’d help me navigate through everything.”\nIn addition to playing a role in the lives of less fortunate children through his work with the foundation, Smith took a hands-on approach when it came to basketball.\nHe frequently took it upon himself to advocate on behalf of a player, hounding the newspapers to write a story and doing what he could to drum up attention.\n“He helped my career; he helped a lot of young ladies go to college from the poor population,” said Jeff Wiggins , an assistant boys coach at Boys & Girls HS, who worked with Smith at Abyssinian.\nHe called the coaches at Marshall University to speak with them about South Shore standout Fannisha Price, who eventually got a scholarship to the school.\n“He was a great man,” South Shore coach Anwar Gladden said. “He really cared about the kids.”\nGladden noted that within the last five months, the city’s girls basketball community has suffered three significant losses with the deaths of Smith and Paschall, and the shooting death of Tayshana (Chicken) Murphy, a standout player who was beginning her senior year at Bergtraum HS in Manhattan.\n“It’s been really hard this year,” Gladden said.\nSmith’s funeral arrangements were not finalized on Tuesday, Wiggins said.\n— with Seth Walder", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:49:16.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
