The Dolphins recently replaced Joe Philbin with interim head coach Dan Campbell, and Chuck Pagano and the Colts struggled out the gate en route to a 3-2 start. \nPayton is under contract until 2017, so a trade or a firing would have to happen for him to switch teams. \nSimilar reports have surfaced around Payton over the last several years, but the Super Bowl-winning head coach has returned each time to New Orleans.
