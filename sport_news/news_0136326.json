Barkley returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown and the Cavaliers never looked back. Charlie Brewer and Abe Willows each ran for two scores as Lake Travis used its ground attack to dominate the Maroons. Lake Travis rumbled for 400 yards rushing on 32 carrries. Willows led the way with 92 yards on just four carries. Backup quarterback Josiah Snowden gained 84 on four carries, including a 62-yard score. Brewer gained 77 yards on four carries while completing just eight of 12 passes for 114 yards.\nLake Travis outgained Austin High 546-135 on the night.\nThe Cavaliers also got touchdown runs from Cade Green and Santiago Villegas. Michael Mast added a special teams touchdown when he returned a fumble for a score when the Maroons mishandled a kickoff.\n“We were a little out of sync with our passing game early,” Cavaliers coach Hank Carter said, “and Charlie got knocked around a little bit. We’ve got some things to fix but I can’t complain about the performance.”\nLake Travis’ defense registered its third shutout in four games. Since Hays scored 13 points on Sept. 12, the Cavaliers have allowed just a fourth-quarter field goal to Anderson, last week. Lake Travis limited Austin High to just 135 yards of offense on the night.\n“We wanted to get ourselves set up for next week,” Barkley said, referring to the showdown with the Chaps. “We’re going into that game full speed.”\nLake Travis 70, Austin High 0\nAustin High (4-3, 2-3) 0 0 0 0 – 0\nLake Travis (7-0, 5-0) 21 35 14 0 – 70\nScoring\n1 st quarter:\nLT: Maleek Barkley 97 kickoff return (Abe Willows run)\nLT: Willows 20 run (Cameron Dicker kick)\nLT: Willows 3 run (pass failed)\n2 nd quarter:\nLT: Charlie Brewer 11 run (Dicker kick)\nLT: Michael Mast 5 fumble return (Dicker kick)\nLT: Cade Brewer 41 pass from Charlie Brewer (Dicker kick)\nLT: Charlie Brewer 57 run (Dicker kick)\nLT: Cade Green 37 run (Dicker kick)\n3 rd quarter:\nLT: Santiago Villegas 5 run (Dicker kick)\nLT: Josiah Snowden 62 run (Marshall Hamelwright kick)\nTeam stats Austin LT\nFirst downs 6 20\nRushes-Yards 31-51 32-400\nPassing Yards 84 146\nPassing 13-24-0 13-17-0\nFumbles-Lost 3-1 0-0\nPenalties-Yards 2-10 6-50\nPunts-Avg 9-42.3 1-5\nIndividual Stats\nRushing:\nAustin: Marcello Mendoza 14-40, Declan Ovalle 5-14\nLT: Abe Willows 4-92, 2 TD; Josiah Snowden 4-84, TD; Charlie Brewer 4-77, 2 TD\nPassing:\nAustin: Beau Kalbacher 10-18-0-72\nLT: Brewer 8-12-0-114, TD; Snowden 5-5-0-32\nReceiving:\nAustin: Jacob Traudt 3-16; Rudy Saenz 3-9; JJ Jacobs 2-33\nLT: Maleek Barkley 3-21; Cade Brewer 2-52, TD, Cade Green 2-30", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/17/1f/b0/2015-10-16_4197_edited-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:37:44.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
