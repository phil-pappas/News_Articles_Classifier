At halftime I said 'let's jump on these guys right away'. I've got to do a better job of completing my speech after we start the beginning of these games. We were seven of eight in the red zone but we kicked three field goals, we have to get better there. I think the big takeaway in the locker room was 'hey, we won. We still have to be more consistent and we have to be honest with each other.' Our goal is to get better every week. If we can do that and eliminate 'bad football', we will become a better football team. We've got some things we need to clean up but we have some playmakers on both sides of the ball and that is who showed up today.\nOn progress made so far in the season...\nSumlin: We've got to clean some things up and get better. We are playing a lot of people and a lot of young guys. The interior of our defense, or a large part of it, was guys who haven't really played since last season. Zaycoven Henderson and Daylon Mack were playmakers on the inside. We got Julien Obioha back who hadn't played since the first game, which was good before we started conference play. That will be key going forward. The good news is, they are capable. We have to get those guys all going and get more consistent.\nProgression of Kyle Allen...\nSumlin: I thought he was really efficient in the game, particularly the first half. Made the mistake with the interception, but that play was a product of the two downs before that where we went backwards and made it third and forever. He's running around just trying to make a play. When I talk about eliminating bad football, it's not just the interception, it's also the plays we went backwards on. It's okay to punt and throw it out of bounds, a lot of people don't believe that. That's all part of young quarterbacks trying to make plays, we will get another chance with the ball. There were some real positives. We have to be better on third down offensively. Like I said, the good news is we can get better. I think this time of year, that is important. If you can win the way we have won the last couple weeks and we are still saying we can get better, to me that's encouraging. Our guys see that and understand that and that is how the maturity level of the team begins to show.\nPlay of offensive line...\nSumlin: I thought we've done some things to help our schemes. I thought Kyle was giving away a little too much information in regards to our schemes so I will have to talk to him about that. He was able to rush for 73 yards but he had some sacks, that's where we have to get better in regards to our pass protection.\nKoda Martin played some tight end and some H Back stuff and Jordan Davis got involved as well. Our pass protection needs to continue to improve, we are seeing a lot of different looks. Anytime you average almost 6 yards a carry though, there's some positives to take away.\nMyles Garrett status...\nSumlin: He's a game changer, it's been a tough week for him, he had his wisdom teeth taken out last Sunday. He didn't practice until Thursday, really Friday, putting a helmet on is a real chore. That showed today, but what a tough guy. I was glad he could get his helmet on today because he made a real difference for us. He's in great shape but there's only so much water and Gatorade you can drink, it's tough to eat. All that kind of piled up on him, but like I said, he's a difference maker.\nI think him and Daeshon Hall have a little contest going, those guys are working well off the edge.\nWe've got more confidence in rolling guys in and out of the game.\nSEC play preparation...\nSumlin: We have to get better every week. We've done things to adjust that from a conditioning standpoint and preparing to return to a neutral site. The things we can draw on because we've played so many guys in the last couple weeks and getting guys back, that was good to get them in today to knock the rust off.\nOn Daylon Mack...\nSumlin: He's only played three games. He's made some plays, he's an impact player, needs to be consistent. It was kind of all-or-nothing in regards to the young guys. The good news is they have what it takes and they are playmakers on the inside. We just need to get them more consistent. If they can make that step, Mack gets better every week.. His progression has been great, Mark Hagen is doing a great job. Daylon is learning to play football at this level and play all the time. He's going to continue to get better, I'm glad he's on our team.\nMORE TEXAS A&M COVERAGE\nHairopoulos: Garrett puts teeth in A&M's D; Ags overcome 'bad football' in 44-27 win over Nevada\nTexas A&M-Nevada notebook: Brandon Williams becomes Aggies' first two-way player since '70s\nFive Thoughts: Kyle Allen has five touchdowns; Myles Garrett 3.5 sacks in No. 17 Texas A&M's 44-27 victory over Nevada\nPhotos: Texas A&M dances day away in win over Nevada\nClick here to visit the Texas A&M page\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/7jpqGLz4lWg?t=561", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/texas-nevada-notebook-brandon-williams-becomes-aggies-first-two-way-player-since-70s", "https://youtu.be/7jpqGLz4lWg?t=470", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-kyle-allen-five-touchdowns-myles-garrett-35-sacks-17-texas-ams-44-27-victory-nevada", "https://youtu.be/7jpqGLz4lWg?t=8", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "https://youtu.be/7jpqGLz4lWg?t=801", "https://youtu.be/7jpqGLz4lWg?t=301", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/hairopoulos-garrett-puts-teeth-ams-d-ags-overcome-bad-football-44-27-win-nevada", "https://youtu.be/7jpqGLz4lWg?t=715", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesports/2015/09/19/photos-texas-dances-day-away-win-nevada", "https://youtu.be/7jpqGLz4lWg?t=168"], "published": "2015-09-20T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:37:43.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
