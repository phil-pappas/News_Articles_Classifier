Phil Gosselin hit an inside-the-park home run for Arizona with two away to start Arizona's rally. Replays appeared to show the ball clearing the yellow line on top of the left-field wall and then bouncing back on the field. The second base umpire did not indicate a home run and by the time left fielder Rafael Ynoa retrieved the ball and threw it back toward the infield, a hustling Gosselin was headed for home.\nPaul Goldschmidt had an infield single and rookie Socrates Brito singled to left before Castillo had his two-run double off reliever Justin Miller (3-3). Castillo then scored on two wild pitches by Boone Logan.\nEnrique Burgos (2-2) got the win in relief for the Diamondbacks despite allowing a run on two hits with two wild pitches in the seventh. Silvino Bracho pitched a scoreless ninth for his first major-league save.\nBrito, a fourth-inning replacement for injured left fielder David Peralta, went 3 for 3 with two runs scored, a run batted in and a stolen base. Castillo had three RBIs.\nThe Rockies got two doubles and two RBIs from Ynoa and two hits and two runs scored from Kyle Parker.\nThe Rockies consistently hit the ball hard off Diamondbacks starter Patrick Corbin, with D.J. LeMahieu lining a single off second baseman Phil Gosselin's glove to drive in Jose Reyes in the first inning.\nThe Diamondbacks took a 2-1 lead with two runs in their half of the first off starter David Hale, who pitched five innings. A.J. Pollock came in on a sacrifice fly by Goldschmidt, his 409th career RBI. That passed Chris Young's 408 for sole possession of fourth place on the club's all-time list.\nGosselin scored on Castillo's ground out before the inning was over.\nColorado chased Corbin after back-to-back doubles for Parker and Ynoa made the score 5-4 in the sixth. Corbin was charged with five runs on 10 hits with five strikeouts and a walk in 5 1/3 innings.\nTom Murphy doubled in Nolan Arenado with two outs in the seventh to give the Rockies a 6-4 lead.\nTHIRD IS THE WORD\nThe Diamondbacks clinched third place in the NL West behind the division-winning Los Angeles Dodgers and runner-up San Francisco Giants with Thursday's win. Arizona is 78-81 with three games to play and the fourth-place San Diego Padres are 74-85 with three games remaining.\nSEE YOU IN APRIL\nArizona and Colorado concluded their 2015 season series Thursday and open up the 2016 regular season in Phoenix with a three-game series April 4-6.\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nDiamondbacks: Peralta injured his right wrist going for a catch of a sinking line drive in the fourth inning. The wrist on his glove hand was bent back as Peralta hit the ground, and the ball popped out for a double. Peralta was checked by a trainer but finished the inning, only to be pinch-hit for in the bottom of the fourth. X-rays were negative and Peralta is day-to-day, the Diamondbacks announced.\nUP NEXT\nRockies: RHP Kyle Kendrick (6-13) makes his final start of the season for the Rockies at San Francisco. He has allowed six earned runs in each of his last two starts, both in Denver. He's 4-7 with a 5.55 ERA on the road this season.\nDiamondbacks: Right-hander Rubby De La Rosa is scheduled to open up a three-game series at home against Houston on Friday. De La Rosa is 14-8 with a 4.56 ERA this season. He can become the ninth Diamondbacks pitcher in club history to win 15 games in a season.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:32:42.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
