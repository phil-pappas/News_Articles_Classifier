The average driver/taxpayer is skeptical, though, about new gas taxes because, as he writes, \"(m)any felt that the (gas) tax would be siphoned off — as previous funding sources had been — to pet projects of the reigning commissioners.\" That's exactly the problem in Oregon and Washington. In both states, great slices of gas tax money are spent for misbegotten missions — bike lanes, streetcars, pedestrian bridges, monorails — which provide no benefits to the taxpaying drivers who cough up the revenue. In Portland (unless City Hall grandees are forced to keep hands in their own pockets), drivers will continue to suffer from teeth-rattling potholes and streets better suited to the deserts of Harney County.\nKenneth S.
