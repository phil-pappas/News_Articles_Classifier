I thought Artavis Scott Artavis Scott #3 5-10, 191Oldsmar, FL View Full Profile was just outstanding. I thought he was the spark in the first quarter. Jordan Leggett Jordan Leggett #16 6-5, 252Navarre, FL View Full Profile continues to be a guy that's showing up on a weekly basis. I'm really pleased with the preparation we had. \n“I thought our offensive line - we had a couple of offensive linemen who didn't play their best game but from a preparation standpoint these guys really presented a lot of challenges, and I thought the communication was very good. Our line as a whole played well. I'm really proud of Deshaun Watson and the way he played. He missed five or six throws that he would like to have back, but man he responded and played great in the second half. It was really a tale of two halves offensively. He got us into some great checks. He had one bad decision all night and that was the first interception. That was just a bad decision and a bad throw. I'm proud of our guys.” \nThe Tigers won despite not winning two key phases of the game. \n“The biggest thing offensively was that we lost the turnover margin and we lost the field position battle, and yet we were still able to put together a bunch of drives,” he said. “We had to earn everything we got. We had a 75-yard drive for a touchdown, an 98-yard drive for a touchdown, an 85-yard drive for a touchdown, and 80-yard drive for a touchdown, and then we had two field goals off of 66 and 69 yard drives, so we played on a long field all night and were able to put drives together against the best defense in the country. I'm really, really proud of what we did there. \n\"Defensively, a ton of big stops. 10 punts. We held them to 87 yards passing. They did bust a couple of runs on us. We probably gave up a few more big plays in the run game than we have in a while, but those are all things that we can improve from. We have to do a better job of communicating. We had a bust on the fourth-and-six at the end of the game with man coverage. Overall, very physical game. I thought our guys responded to that. They were 3-of-15 on third down. A bunch of tackles for loss and a couple of sacks. It was just a complete team effort.” \nClemson travels to Sun Life Stadium to take on the Canes in a noon kickoff and Swinney said the Tigers expect Miami’s best shot. \n\"Yes. This is a really talented team. We don't expect anything but their best effort. We're going to get everyone's best A-game. I think our guys know that every where we go, we're not going to get anybody's B-game or C-game. We're going to get the best they've got, and that's why it is important that we are dialed in each and every week and putting our best foot forward preparation-wise and with our focus. This is the University of Miami. \n“They're coming off a big win and we have a long way to travel down there. They're getting ready to play a top-ranked undefeated team. There will be great energy from their standpoint and we've got to match that. This is a team that's very talented. This quarterback is very impressive. We're just kind of getting going into looking at these guys today, but they're capable of playing with anybody. There's no doubt about that. They're certainly capable of beating us. We're going to have to play a great ballgame on the road to have a chance to win.” \nThe contest is the first of two straight on the road, with four of the last six being played away from Death Valley. \n“It's just different when you go on the road in that you're not playing in front of your home crowd and all of that type of stuff. I've always enjoyed going on the road,” Swinney said. “I like the challenge, even the hostility of going on the road and everyone cheering against you if you will. I've always enjoyed that part of it. Your routine is a little different. Your Friday routine is different because now you have to go to the airport. We try to keep things as normal as possible. We still do our game-prep on Friday here. At the end of the day it's about how you play and how you execute. That's what we focus on. For us to have a great second half of the season, we have to win on the road.\" \nOTHER NOTES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:31:38.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
