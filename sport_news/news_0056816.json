It bothers me that WR Victor Cruz won't play in his first game of the season because of a setback with his strained calf. But quarterback Eli Manning has not thrown an interception this season, and Odell Beckham Jr. is impossible to cover. The Bills likely will be without WR Sammy Watkins and RB LeSean McCoy , and I am not convinced that Tyrod Taylor is the answer at quarterback. The Giants will pick up where they left off against the Redskins. Giants, 24-21.
