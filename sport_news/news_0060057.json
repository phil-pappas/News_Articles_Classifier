(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) \nNEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Joe Pavelski and Brent Burns scored in the shootout and the San Jose Sharks rode another big effort by goaltender Martin Jones in posting a 2-1 victory over the winless New Jersey Devils on Friday night. \nJones stopped 31 shots and came within 3:38 of posting his third straight shutout as the Sharks posted their fourth straight win under former New Jersey coach Pete DeBoer. They also kept the Devils winless at 0-3-1 under new coach John Hynes. \nDeBoer, who was fired by the Devils last season, is now 4-0 with San Jose. \nPatrick Marleau scored for the Sharks in the opening minute and the goal stood until Adam Henrique tied the game on a power play with 3:38 to play in regulation. \nHenrique scored for New Jersey on its first shootout attempt but Jacob Josefson was stopped on the second and Mike Cammalleri missed the net on the third. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:16:55.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
