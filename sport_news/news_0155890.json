Malzahn says he gave Williams \"the chance to prove himself.\" But he added there must be consequences \"when individuals fail to meet the expectations of our program.\" \nMalzahn didn't elaborate. \nWilliams was having a disappointing season after coming in rated by NFL draft analysts as one of the nation's top receiver prospects. He had 12 catches for 147 yards and one touchdown. \nWilliams returned for his senior season after the junior college transfer made 45 catches for 730 yards. \nHe was suspended for the Outback Bowl and again for nearly a week early in preseason camp. \nAuburn opened the season ranked sixth nationally but has already lost twice. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:59:43.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
