Worldwide, he’s third behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. \nThis is according to a listing in Kit Bag, with a hat tip to FOX Sports @ The Buzzer, video below: \nAs the video points out, Angel Di Maria was the #1 best seller in England last year. \nUnited gave both players the number that is associated with the best in club history. David Beckham. Cristiano Ronaldo. George Best. Eric Cantona. Bryan Robson. \nWhile it seems that many want to dress like Memphis Depay does on the pitch, few people (or at least few should) want to dress like he does off the pitch. \nPaul M.
