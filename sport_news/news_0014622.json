The Magic led 13-2 early and eventually built a 28-point edge. Victor Oladipo scored 13 for Orlando and Evan Fournier added 10 for the Magic. Marcelo \"Marcelinho\" Machado , a longtime Brazilian star and a veteran of international play, led Flamengo with 17 points. MAGIC: Orlando held the Brazilian club to 32 percent shooting, while connecting on 49 percent of its own shots. ... Vucevic addressed the raucous crowd before the game, thanking them for their hospitality on Orlando's visit. ... Backup C Greg Stiemsma made his preseason debut, checking in during the fourth quarter. ... Magic coach Scott Skiles said he was happy with the way his team handled the trip. \"We knew it was going to be a good environment to play in,\" Skiles said. FLAMENGO: It was the second straight season that Flamengo — which plays in Brazil's top league — lost to the Magic. Flamengo went winless on a three-game preseason NBA tour last year against Orlando, Phoenix and Memphis. SKILES CAUTIOUS: Skiles kept Aaron Gordon (soreness) and Elfrid Payton (hamstring) out of the game, though neither injury issue is considered serious. UP NEXT: Orlando returns home Wednesday for its next-to-last preseason contest, playing host to New Orleans.
