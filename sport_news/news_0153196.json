They have shown that a lot of times,\" Van Gaal said, before adding that \"in a technical and tactical sense\" Arsenal are arguably the best team in the league. \nUnited are top of the league at the moment, while Arsenal are fourth. \n“Nevertheless, they haven’t won so much, so you have to look for that improvement with that team.” \nThe Dutchman admits that his players are tired after a tough schedule, but insists they will be up for the Emirates Stadium clash. \"The solution is recovery, recovery, recovery,\" he added. \n“That is why it’s so difficult to prepare for the match against Arsenal. \n“We have to see how the evaluation is from my fatigue specialist.” The former Netherlands coach went on to commend Ashley Young and Chris Smalling, after revealing that he has no fresh injury worries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:07:05.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
