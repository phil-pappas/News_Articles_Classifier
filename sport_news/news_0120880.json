DETROIT (AP) - The United Auto Workers union was expected today to release results of a vote on a tentative contract deal reached with Fiat-Chrysler. If approved, the union will use the Fiat Chrysler deal as a template for talks with Ford and General Motors. LUXEMBOURG (AP) - The European Union's top court says the Bitcoin virtual currency that is used online and over the Internet should be exempt from sales taxes within the 28-country bloc.
