Buy Now For the Herald & Review, Stephen Haas \nEisenhower's Colton Lockwood runs the ball under pressure from a group of Chatham Glenwood defenders during Friday night's game. \nDECATUR – After falling 22 points behind Chatham Glenwood within the first 11 minutes Friday, Eisenhower never came closer than 16 for the rest of the night. \nThe Panthers sure tried though. Quarterback Cayleb Dehority threw for two touchdowns of more than 35 yards in the first half and a 6-yarder to go into halftime down 18. \nDehority threw a 35-yard touchdown to Stephon Jarrett, and LaMontie Williams returned a kickoff 90 yards for another score less than two minutes later. \nBut on the opposite end of the big plays Eisenhower's offense – and once special teams – came up with, the Panthers' defense continually got leveled by the Titans. \nFinally, trailing by 25 points with four minutes remaining, Eisenhower waved the white flag. The Panthers punted on a fourth-and-long play, surrendering a 56-31 loss to Chatham Glenwood, and away went their five-game winning streak. \n“We can shootout for a while, but they stopped us more than we stopped them,” said Eisenhower coach Drew Wagers, whose team dropped to 5-3. \nFor a while, the shootout was reminiscent of the Panthers' first two losses – 79-48 against Rochester and 74-31 against Sacred Heart-Griffin. In those, they hung around for a while before tailing off. \nOn Friday, the Panthers were late to the show. Chatham Glenwood scored in four plays after taking the opening kickoff. Eisenhower went three-and-out, and then the Titans scored again. \nDehority fumbled twice on the Panthers' next drive, losing the second one. The Titans took over on a short field – the 17-yard line – and scored in two plays for a 22-0 lead. \nThe Titans scored a touchdown on all five of its first-half drives. A sixth ended because time expired. \n“Offensively, I think we were pretty much unstoppable,” Chatham Glenwood coach Dan Rourke said. “I know Eisenhower counts on that offense scoring a lot of points and outscoring folks. I think we did just enough to keep them at bay.” \nThe Titans could do no wrong all night. They used five different running backs, with Brandon Hay, David Jones and Zakary Wardlow all with more than 70 yards. Quarterback Cole Hembrough completed his first six passes (three for touchdowns) and finished with six total (five passing, two rushing). Even their trick plays worked – a Statue of Liberty play for a big gain and halfback pass (Hay to Andrew Morrow) for a 26-yard touchdown on third-and-long in the second quarter. \n“We try to pull some things out each week, and the things we pulled out are big play things,” Rourke said. “They tend to work, and they worked tonight.” \nEisenhower's defense allowed 479 yards of total offense. \n“We just weren't getting an penetration,” Wagers said. “They found vertical gaps. They took advantage of it. We couldn't handle them man-to-man. We were getting lose in all the confusion. They had a great game plan. They executed. We just didn't.” Alex's take \nWhen all was said and done, Eisenhower's point after attempts didn't matter so much. \nBut that doesn't mean the game could've looked a little differently had the Panthers converted. \nThe Panthers failed on its first three attempts – each time going for a two-point conversion. They tried an extra point field goal with Jordan Young, trailing 43-24, which he missed. \nYoung converted the Panthers' next extra point to make it 49-31. \nChatham Glenwood, meanwhile, has Devan Linkey. He was 6-for-7 on PATs. After halftime \nEisenhower got the ball to start the second half, down 36-18, and a good kick return brought the ball to the 48-yard line. The Panthers didn't take advantage. \nSalat Al-Nurridin gained 11 yards on the first down play, then nothing on his next carry. Dehority threw three straight incompletions, including one behind Jarrett and a deep ball in the endzone through Jarrett's hands. \nThey forced the Titans three-and-out and started their next drive with a 7-yard pass. But the Panthers followed it up with two rushes for no gain and a pass broken up to turn it over on downs. \nThe Titans scored on the next possession. Quotable \n“They've just got a lot of weapons. There's a lot of different backs. And they've gotten better from watching all their games Week 1 to now. They've got a little bit different style offense than most people run right now. It's something we haven't seen yet.” – Wagers on the Titans' offensive style \namcnamee@herald-review.com|(217) 421-6970", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:19:15.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
