He asked a maintenance worker to notify authorities about skeletal remains in the woods across the street.\nThe deputies found the remains, which appeared to have been disturbed by animals. Officials say several people had been living in the woods, which is known for transient visitors. People living there gave the deputies information about the dead person's possible identity.\nInvestigators weren't immediately able to confirm the identity or how the person died.\nAssociated Press\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616f660/turbine/ct-man-carries-skull-to-shopping-center-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:00:50.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
