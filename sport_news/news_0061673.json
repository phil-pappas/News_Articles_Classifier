(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- While undefeated Reeds Spring has its share of doubters, the sixth-ranked Wolves certainly looked the part of area heavyweight Friday night versus Springfield Central. Reeds Spring built up an early lead on senior night, and then held off a furious fourth-quarter comeback to down Central 35-24. The Wolves got off to an fast start in the opening half, thanks to a ground-and-pound, triple- option attack led by quarterback Nick Haddock. Haddock rushed for 224 yards and three touchdowns on the evening. The senior also capped off the first half with a 20-yard touchdown pass to receiver Adam Taylor. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS While Haddock chewed up the yardage by calling his own number early and often, he was quick to credit his offensive line for the big holes up front.\"All week, we preached that if we won up front, we were going win this ball game,\" Haddock said. \"Our offensive line and defensive line, for that matter, did a great job tonight. They're a great ball team, and I don't think their record represents how good they are, so we knew we were going to have to come to work all week and do what we could to get the win.\" What the Wolves did, for the most part, was hold Central's sophomore duo of quarterback Quintin Batson and running back Garrett King in check ... at least until the fourth quarter. Down 35-6, the Bulldogs mounted a spirited comeback, scoring three times in the quarter to cut the lead to 11. King scored on a 29-yard run, and the pair hooked up for a 19-yard scoring pass at the end of the game. In the end, conversions and a string of unsuccessful onside kicks caused the Bulldog rally to come up short. Reeds Spring head coach Lance Gosch admitted to being just a bit anxious late in the game as he watched the score tighten up.\"I thought, the first half, was the best we've played all year long,\" Gosch said. \"Then, we got kind of sloppy in the second half, put the ball on the ground and gave them some short fields. You don't ever want to see that, but I thought our kids responded. They didn't get their heads down and kept playing.\" Gosch also praised his senior quarterback for effectively running the option attack and taking what the defense gave him ... in this case, his own rushing success between the tackles.\"In our offense, you just never know who's going to stand up,\" Gosch said. \"[Haddock] does a great job running our offense, and he does a lot of stuff at the line of scrimmage to get us in the right plays. He did a fantastic job tonight.\" Next up for the Reeds Spring (8-0) is a matchup at powerhouse Bolivar (7-1) for the Central Ozark Conference Small Division championship. Central (4-4), meanwhile, plays host to Mt. Vernon.
