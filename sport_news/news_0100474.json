Healdton's 46-6 win over Central (Marlow) on Oct. 15, coupled with Wilson's 28-13 setback to Rush Springs on the same night clinched a playoff berth for the Bulldogs. Marietta 30, Hugo 14 Marietta coach Matt Suffal wasn’t aware that his Indians had secured their first playoff berth since 2013 until he went home Friday night and examined the scores and statistics for the other teams in District 2A-4. Marietta (4-4 overall, 2-2 2A-4) used a 24-point fourth quarter to overcome a two-point deficit for a 30-14 win over Hugo (2-6, 1-4). Hard work in the weight room during the offseason paved the way for the Wildcats’ second playoff appearance over the last three years. “When we got sent home last year at Coalgate, the guys realized that they had to get better,” Suffal said. “They bought into the program and got stronger in the weight room. We had kids coming out on their own to get in the weight room. We got closer as a team.” Fifth-place Hugo is one game behind Marietta in the district standings but determining the formula for the Indians to make the playoffs came down to one factor: head to head. Marietta can lose its last two games of the regular season and will still make the playoffs because of its win over Hugo. The Buffaloes only have one more district game remaining (Friday at home, vs. Tishomingo); the Indians have two (Friday at Atoka and Nov. 6 at Coalgate). Trailing 8-6 heading into the fourth quarter, Marietta’s offense came to life. Chris Campos caught touchdown passes of 50 yards and 57 from quarterback Rope Freeman, in the rain, nonetheless. The 57-yard score put Marietta in front 30-14 with 5:38 remaining. Jonathan Escobedo added a 17-yard touchdown run. “I’m surprised that we had that many passing yards in that monsoon,” Suffal said. Braxton Davis ran from three yards out in the first quarter to put Marietta in front 6-0. Hugo scored a touchdown and a two-point conversion in the second quarter to take an 8-6 lead. Ringling 28, Rush Springs 0 At Rick Gandy Field, Ringling rushed for 349 yards on 54 carries and limited the Rush Springs ground game to just 22 carries for 46 yards in the Blue Devils’ 28-0 win over the Redskins. Forced to pass the ball through the air, Rush Springs had 109 passing yards, but could not get it in the end zone against the smothering Blue Devils defense. Class A’s No. 3 Ringling (6-0 overall, 4-0 in district A-3) took a 7-0 lead when Trevor Richardson scored on a six-yard run with five minutes remaining in the first quarter. Page 2 of 5 - The Blue Devils upped their advantage to 14-0 at intermission after Austin Phelps ran in from 15 yards out. “Our defense did a great job against their running game,” Ringling assistant coach Ben Justus said. “Stopping their run was a key to the win. On offense our line did a solid job of opening up holes for our three running backs. And quarterback Dalton Swindler continues to improve at quarterback. “This was a great effort on both sides of the football by our players. Hopefully this is the kind of win that we can build on for our final two regular season games and on into the playoffs.” Rhett Longest paced the Blue Devils with 15 carries for 122 yards, and Phelps had 106 yard on 13 carries with one touchdown. Richardson finished with 17 carries for 81 yards and one score. Swindler scored on a one-yard keeper play for Ringling with 7:46 left in the fourth and then hit Dewyatt Cox with a nine-yard touchdown pass with 44 seconds left in the game to complete the scoring. Kingston 13, Coalgate 8 In a game that was delayed once for lightning and featured several muffs, fumbles and interceptions, Class 2A’s No. 6 Kingston Redskins secured a first-round home playoff game with a 13-8 triumph of Coalgate at muddy Kingston on Friday night. “It was a tough night for footing and definitely one of the most unique games I’ve ever seen,” Kingston coach John Caraway said. “The field was as bad as I have ever seen. The kids really played hard and overcame adversity throughout the game. The defense just did an outstanding job.” A fumble by Coalgate at its own 10-yard line late in the third quarter led to the winning score for the undefeated Redskins (8-0 overall, 5-0 District 2A-4). On third and goal from the Coalgate 1, Kingston quarterback Tyler Stovall flipped a short pass to Cody Flesher for a 13-8 lead. With less than four minutes remaining in regulation, Coalgate was driving inside Kingston territory. The Wildcats had fourth and nine at the Redskins 36 but a Coalgate wide receiver caught a pass that had been tipped by a Kingston defender. That completion moved the ball to the Redskins 9. Coalgate gained just two yards on the next two plays and was forced to turn the ball over on downs. Stovall ran the ball three straight times and got a first down to seal the Redskins’ latest victory. “Our key to the game was our defensive front,” Caraway said. “They put tremendous pressure along with some blitzes on the Coalgate quarterback and running backs throughout the game. Our special teams a good job as well. We play better in dry conditions and the passing game helps our running game. It is hard to utilize our speed in those conditions.” Page 3 of 5 - Stovall accounted for both Redskins touchdowns, the first on a one-yard run with 27 seconds remaining in the first quarter. Igor Grossi kicked the extra point. Webbers Falls 18, Thackerville 8 It was a good news, bad news scenario for Thackerville — but mostly good. Thackerville saw a five-game winning streak end in an 18-8 home loss to Webbers Falls on Friday. The good news for Thackerville (6-2 overall, 5-1 District C4) is that Fox’s 52-0 rout of Midway (3-5, 3-4) clinched a playoff berth for the Wildcats. Thackerville and Webbers Falls (6-2, 5-1) are tied for second in the district. Webbers Falls led 6-0 after 12 minutes and added six more points in the second quarter to increase its lead to 12-0 at intermission. Payton Brawley rushed for a 30-yard touchdown in the third quarter, accounting for Thackerville’s lone score. Thackerville tallied just four yards through the air and quarterback Justice Buckaloo completed two of nine passes for just four yards with three interceptions. He found better success running the ball, scampering for a team-high 75 yards on 22 carries. Brawley carried the ball six times for 44 yards. Defensively, Ethan Wilson and Tyler Wade each had seven solo tackles and assisted on five other stops. Drake Wells recorded four solo tackles and assisted on five others. He and Brawley recovered one fumble apiece. Buckaloo contributed eight total tackles (four solo, four assists). Sulphur 42, Madill 14 Sulphur bounced back from a loss to Class 3A’s No. 6 John Marshall and continued its undefeated run in District 3A-4 with an impressive 42-14 triumph of Madill at Agee Field on Friday. With the win, Sulphur clinched a playoff berth. Two consecutive kickoff returns to open the game fired up each team’s fan base. Dakevis Jordan started the Wildcats off on the right foot after returned the opening kickoff along the sideline 75 yards. Jose Guevara kicked the extra point for a 7-0 Madill lead. Sulphur’s Houston Haines took the ensuing kickoff and returned it 85 yards for the touchdown. Jared Williams booted the first of his six extra points, tying the score at 7. It was all Sulphur from that point as the Bulldogs scored 42 unanswered points. Cameron Jones ran for a 40-yard touchdown with 1:24 remaining in the first quarter to give the Bulldogs (6-2, 4-0 3A-4) the lead for good. Jones had a big game with 141 yards on 16 carries. Cole Palmer sandwiched runs of three and 21 yards around a 57-pass play between him and Tyler Bumgarner. His 21-yard scamper put Sulphur ahead 35-7 seven seconds into the fourth quarter. Michael Robles scooped up a fumble and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown for a 42-14 Sulphur lead. He also had two interceptions. Page 4 of 5 - Madill’s Jonathan Lafitta scored on an 11-yard run with 2:06 remaining for the game’s final tally. Danny Sanchez and Jordan Herndon each had a fumble recovery for the Wildcats (3-6, 2-3). Micah Cooper rushed for 103 yards in the loss. Davis 41, Atoka 14 With Friday’s 41-14 rout of Atoka, Davis clinched a playoff berth, assuring the Wolves, ranked No. 7 in Class 2A, they will be given the opportunity to compete for a third consecutive state championship. Davis (5-3, District 2A-4) had little trouble with Atoka (1-7, 0-4). The Wolves led 41-0 with 4:36 in the first quarter and never looked back. Trever Merrell opened the scoring with a 32-yard touchdown run. Hunter Karlik recovered a blocked punt and ran for the score. Davis’ third touchdown of the opening quarter, all within the game’s first 4:05, came on a 99-yard run by Taylor Ball. After a fumble recovery, Merrell ran for his second touchdown, this one on a scamper of five yards. Briston Summers added a 16-yard rushing touchdown at the 9:59 mark of the second quarter for a five-possession lead for Davis. Jordan Thomas made it 41-0 Wolves with an eight-yard run. Davis travels to Coalgate this week and then will host district-leader Kingston (8-0, 5-0) on Nov. 6. Fox 52, Midway 0 At the Fox Den, the Foxes put away their sixth consecutive opponent by the mercy rule as they rolled to a 52-0 victory over the Midway Chargers from Council Hill. Fox had 333 rushing yards and 95 passing yards for 428 total offensive yards in just 24 minutes of playing time. The Foxes limited the Chargers to 54 total offensive yards and sent the visitors home with a 3-5 overall record and a 3-4 district mark. Fox (8-0 overall, 6-0 in district C-4) got on the board quickly when Frank Davidson scored on an 18-yard run. The Foxes, ranked No. 2 in the latest AP poll, increased their lead to 14-0 when Donovan Pettis scored on a 35-yard run. Late in the first quarterback Seth Argo hit Trent Fletcher with a 10-yard touchdown pass to make it 22-0 heading to the second quarter. Davidson finished with eight carries for 167 yards and two touchdowns. He had two receptions for 32 yards and another score. Argo had 63 yards rushing on four carries and a touchdown and was six of 10 through the air for 95 yards and two touchdowns. In the second quarter, Davidson scored on an 80-yard run, and Jamiroquai Boyd ran it in from two yards out for a 36-0 Fox lead. A 35-yard scoring pass from Argo to Davidson made it 44-0. Late in the half, Argo scored on a 20-yard run to make the score 52-0. Page 5 of 5 - The game ended at halftime by mercy rule. The Foxes host the Thackerville Wildcats this week and finish the regular season Nov. 6 when they travel to Bokoshe. Wilson 50, Central 14 At Marlow, the Wilson Eagles bounced back from their tough loss to Rush Springs with a 50-14 victory over the Central Marlow Bronchos. Wilson quarterback Austin Schiralli had 11 carries for 117 yards and four touchdowns and was two of five through the air for 39 yards and one touchdown. Schiralli scored on two, two-yard runs in the first quarter, and Wilson’s Jake Barnes broke free for a 49-yard touchdown run to make it a 20-8 lead after the first 12 minutes. In the second quarter, Schiralli scored on runs of one yard and 63 yards to put the Eagles comfortably ahead 36-8 at intermission. “This was a big win for us after a hard-fought loss to Rush Springs,” Wilson coach Danny Lee said. “The players fought back and played very well on the road. “We put Jake (Barnes) at wide receiver and used a jet sweep to get him free to the outside. That worked well for us. He scored four times, but two were called back by penalties. “Austin had a huge night running and throwing the football, and our offensive line did great opening up running lanes for our backs. Defensively, we executed well and held them to just 69 yards of offense. It was a satisfying win for our team to help us get back on track.” Barnes finished with two carries for 116 yards and two touchdowns. The Eagles offense finished with 321 offense yards, and the Wilson defense held the Broncos to 63 rushing yards and six yards through the air. Schiralli hit Zach Campbell with a 40-yard scoring pass early in the third, and in the fourth, a 67-yard sweep by Barnes gave Wilson a 50-8 lead. Wilson (3-5 overall, 2-3 District A-3) will entertain the Healdton Bulldogs (5-3, 3-1) this week at Skinny Stewart Stadium. The Eagles must defeat Healdton on Friday and will need help from Ringling in Week 10 in order to make the playoffs. — Glenn Price contributed to the Kingston-Coalgate game recap.
