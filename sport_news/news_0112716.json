I try to see where they kick it and do my best to get there,\" Griesemer said. \"I'm not very successful most of the time, but tonight I got lucky. That might be the only PK I've saved in a game. \n\"I'm just trying to get inside the kicker's head and knock her off her game a little bit,\" she added. \"I guess it worked.\" \nIt wasn't just the penalty stop though, as Griesemer was peppered by shots from a determined Henderson squad. She stood firm, making eight saves, including a few key stops down the stretch. \nHer teammates rewarded her hard work. Kendall Ammerman's effort earned a corner kick with 3 minutes, 20 seconds remaining. \nCassie Cheeseman took the corner from the left side. She hit it high and curved it into the net, fooling the keeper. The placement and pace were spot-on. \nGriesemer began the game in her sweats, cheering on her teammates. \nAfter her big second half, her teammates were the ones cheering for her. \nWest Chester Rustin 0 1 - 1 \nWest Chester Henderson 0 0 - 0 \nGoal: WCRÂ–Cassie Cheeseman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:45:26.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
