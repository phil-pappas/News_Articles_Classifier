Additional images below. San Miguel County Sheriff's Office First things first: We're not bestowing Schmuck of the Week honors on Eldon Dick simply because his name is \"Eldon Dick.\"\nWe're a little more mature than that — although, truth be told, if his name was \"Eldon Schmuck,\" we might have been unable to resist.\nNo, we're tipping the dunce cap to the 55-year-old Dick (love the way that sounds) because he was busted in Nevada after allegedly bragging to strangers about being wanted for crimes in Colorado.\nAnd some pretty schmucky crimes they were.\nOn October 17, the San Miguel County Sheriff's Office put out an alert about Dick, who resides in Egnar. As noted on the town's Wikipedia page , its name is \"Range\" spelled backwards — and a 2014 video by 4CornersTV puts Egnar's population at 129.\nHere's how you know you're in Egnar.

There, they stumbled on suspected stolen property worth approximately $5,500.\nThat's when they issued a warrant for Dick's arrest on a slew of charges, including criminal trespass, theft, child abuse, prohibited use of a weapon, harassment and criminal mischief.\nHe didn't take it well — no surprise given that he's said to have a history of felony arrests in San Miguel County dating back to 2007.

On October 20, the sheriff's office learned he had stayed at a motel in Elko, Nevada, where staffers became suspicious of him after he \"bragged about having a warrant from Colorado and said he was on his way to California to find a lawyer,\" a news release notes.

He was taken into custody sans incident, with the sheriff's office subsequently kicking off the process of extraditing him to Colorado.\nInsert your own Dick joke here.\nHere's a larger look at his booking photo.\nEldon Dick.
