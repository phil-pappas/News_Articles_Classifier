Every day, I get calls from friends and people in responsible positions in Delhi, wanting to know “what is happening in Punjab”. There is a note of anxiety in their query. A sense of apprehension in their voice is discernible. As a student of Indian politics, I am unable to comprehend why the “situation” is getting aggravated — or, is being allowed to get aggravated. This creeping sense of drift and anarchy is all the more baffling because the state is fortunate enough to have a very wise and seasoned man as its Chief Minister. There is not a single gur (ruse) or painch (stratagem) that he does not know. By any reckoning, Parkash Singh Badal is an old warhorse. His ability to connect with the people remains very much unimpaired. Yet, there is a feeling of ineffectiveness and helplessness. It has been suggested to me that perhaps the senior leader no longer calls the shots. Or, is not being allowed to call the shots. Tactical initiative and political cunning have been wrested by the younger generation. Maybe, maybe not. I have little understanding of the intricacies and intrigues in Sikh politics. However, it is elementary knowledge that the SGPC is now an instrument controlled by the Akali Dal. (Incidentally, I have been told of the many puns about what the acronym SGPC could stand for). The Akali Dal has deftly positioned itself as the custodian of the Sikhs’ religious interests. But religion always — anywhere in the world, in any society — makes an unsteady basis for political involvement. Just one wrong move, and the whole edifice comes crashing down. The “pardon” controversy has become such a volatile issue because it was perceived that behind it there was a “deal”, a quid pro quo. The Sikh radical fringe has always been around. Why and how at a particular time it is able to occupy the centrestage is the stuff of realpolitik. In normal political terms, only unwise politicians and their unwise politics allow the fringe to move to the centre. Till a month ago, the farmers were out on the road. Their agitation was a natural expression of their desperation. The countryside in Punjab is in distress. The farming community is angry and feels alienated. Suddenly, the farmers’ issue got relegated to the backburner as there was this eruption of hurt Sikh sentiments. Because religion is so central to the Sikh community, it was natural that the anger over a sacrilege should have spilled out on to the streets. Also, this was the most propitious context for the radical fringe to move in. Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has carved out an image for himself of a moderate and is respected in and out of Punjab for his ability to “handle” the hotheads. Perhaps, the disarray in the AAP ranks has induced a sense of cynical realism among the Akali leaders. True, the “official faction” is at war with the field commanders. But it would be a mistake for anyone to write off the promise and appeal of AAP-type politics in Punjab. The goings-on in the Punjab Congress are beyond the ken of any reasonable man. The Congress high command has so far demonstrated only a strange, but familiar, indifference to the ground realities. It cannot decide what to do with Capt Amarinder Singh. And, the good Captain is allowing himself to be brainwashed by his chamchas, who seem to be telling him day in and day out that “he is the tallest leader” in Punjab. The political leaders’ preoccupation with internal games has left the people vulnerable to unhelpful forces and ideas. I f religion is making itself felt in Punjab, another type of religious preoccupation is so visible in the neighbouring Haryana. One year of Manohar Lal Khattar’s rule has left the state out of breath, out of ideas, and out of modernity. By comparison, Khattar has made Badal look such an administrative giant. Till recently, Haryana was a well-run state. It had a working government. Khattar has managed to change all that, within a short space of time. In his defence, it is said that Khattar is a simple man, an honest man, a swayamsevak, and a total stranger to the art and intricacies of administration. There is no doubt that the membership of the RSS must have given him some redeeming qualities. But a flair for governance is not one of those. In fact, it appears that the Chief Minister has no clue to — nor an interest in — the painstaking task of providing administrative leadership. But Khattar’s fascination for Baba Ramdev is inexplicable. There could not have been a more disconcerting sight than that of the Chief Minister celebrating his one year in office by sharing the stage and spotlight with Baba Ramdev. The Chief Minister is perfectly entitled to practising alom-vilom in the privacy of his garden, but it makes no sense for him to perform these yogic kriyas in public. That, too, in the company of Baba Ramdev. It is generally believed that Baba Ramdev stands elevated as the rajguru, the most powerful extra-constitutional authority in the state. The political and administrative establishment has no guts to keep a questionable religious figure-turned-business tycoon at an arm’s length. T he other day, I received a communication from an amateur filmmaker, Paramjeet Singh Kattu. He provided me a YouTube link to his short, 22-minute movie called Adda Khadda — The Game of Life. In the covering note, Kattu tells of his effort to weave into the movie themes of religion, unfulfillment, submission and bondage. My curiosity was whetted. The English subtitles of the Punjabi film helped. Many purists will surely have many reasons to find many faults on many technical grounds in the movie, but I found it brilliant in conception. Paramjeet, a young boy of Kattu village in Barnala, has brilliantly used the imagery of the common street game adda khadda (staapu) to portray the plight of women. The picture is a moving depiction of the brutal toll indebtedness has taken on the morals and manners in rural Punjab. A young daughter is forced by her impoverished and heavily indebted parents into marriage with a rich but patently disagreeable Canada-based NRI. The buffoonish man apparently owns a successful transport business. However, the woman has her own mind, her own dreams. But the mother counsels and coerces her into accepting this plainly transactional marriage. The girl seeks escape in suicide. Her ultimate defiance forces a younger sister and the repentant mother to resolve to “fight” against an unjust social order and the unjust demands it makes on women. I have to periodically travel between Chandigarh and Delhi. The preferred, most convenient mode of travel is the Shatabdi. An otherwise comfortable journey becomes very uncomfortable because the airconditioning is kept at full blast. It becomes decidedly uncomfortable if you happen to be assigned an aisle seat. The cool draught hits you like a bucket of cold water poured on your head. I am sure that by the end of the three-and-a-half-hour journey, many passengers must be ending up with a dose of cold. What is more, most passengers seem to be resigned uncomplainingly to this suffering. Some even come armed with a sweater, or a shawl. A totally avoidable waste of energy.
