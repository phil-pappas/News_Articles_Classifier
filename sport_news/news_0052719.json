Three plays later, quarterback Griffin Peene went 59 yards on a keeper off the left side for a touchdown.\nAustin Denise buried the Mustangs (2-1-1) at the 2-yard line with a punt and Kiernan returned the ensuing Clifton punt 22 yards to the Mustang 8. It set up Erik Bachrach for a 1-yard touchdown.\nBachrach made it 24-0 with just over 4 minutes left in the first half with a 31-yard scamper.\nThe Maroons scored off their first series of the third quarter, a 6-yarder by Peene, who paced the Ridgewood ground game with 10 carries for 114 yards. They were marching again when the lights went out with 3:05 left in the third.\nThe offense sputtered thanks to the delay, combined with injuries to Bachrach (collarbone) and fullback Coleston Smith (ankle).\nClifton had scored just before the lights went out on a 26-yard pass from Joe Santillo to Delano Dixon.\n“That was a no quit performance,” Johnson said of the Mustangs. “That impressed me. They could have quit and they never did. [Clifton coach] Ralph [Cinque] deserves a lot of credit for the way that team is playing.”\nDixon and Santillo hooked up again in the fourth quarter with 1:52 left for a 4-yard TD pass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:48:01.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
