It was the second time in the past three Olympic cycles that the U.S. failed to advance. \nCanada has not participated in the Summer Games since 1984. \nThe U.S. plays its second game in Group A on Saturday night against Cuba, which managed a 1-1 draw with Panama earlier in the day. The final group matches will be played next week in Colorado, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the semifinals Oct. 10 in Utah. \nThe two finalists qualify for Rio, and the third-place team faces Colombia in a playoff. \nMorris, a 20-year-old Stanford junior, got things off to a rousing start when he got free in front of the Canada goal. Kiesewetter sent a cross right to him, and Morris deftly headed it into the net before most of the people in the sparse crowd had found their seats. \nMorris scored his second goal in the 73rd minute. \nKiesewetter, who plays for VFB Stuttgart in Germany, kept pressure on the Canadian defense all night. He made a nifty move in the 21st minute before sending a shot wide, and moments later made another solid attempt that goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau deflected away. \nHe also forced Crepeau to make a nice save on a breakaway in the second half. \nCanada squandered some decent scoring chances early. Christopher Mannella was awarded a free kick in the ninth minute that he delivered into U.S. goalkeeper Zack Steffen's gut, and Mannella's shot off a breakaway early in the second half was also saved. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:12:54.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
