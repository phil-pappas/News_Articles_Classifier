( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer ) \nGiven the circus of a scandal unfolding at national power Louisville, it is little surprise CU men's basketball coach Tad Boyle has been reminded of the lone after-hours phone call he has received from one of his players during a recruiting visit. \nIt was a few years ago, and former CU star Spencer Dinwiddie was hosting a recruit. Naturally, when Boyle's phone rang late at night his first instinct was to brace for the worst. \nIt turns out, Dinwiddie was calling with the sort of request that's a coach's dream. \n\"My phone has rang once during a recruiting visit, and it was because (Dinwiddie and the recruit) wanted to get in the gym and shoot,\" Boyle said. \"Our compliance compartment does a great job of educating our players and our coaches. I trust our players to make good decisions. We haven't had any issues.\" \nAlthough he has no personal ties to Louisville or Cardinals coach Rick Pitino, Boyle said he has paid attention to the drama unfolding in northern Kentucky. For any college basketball fans who have been in a cave for the bulk of the week, Pitino's program is under fire after an ESPN report surfaced alleging former graduate assistant Andre McGee paid for stripper parties for Louisville basketball players and recruits. \nWhether it is the blossoming Louisville scandal or the off-court foibles that have marred the vaunted programs at Connecticut, Syracuse and, more recently, SMU and its legendary coach, Larry Brown, Boyle says he keeps a careful eye on such situations as a matter of practice in keeping tabs on his industry.

I don't know that program. We don't recruit against them. If it's true, it's really sad. If it's not true, it's really sad they have to go through this to clear their name. \n\"It makes me appreciate the players we have in our program and the coaches we have on our staff.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:03:21.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
