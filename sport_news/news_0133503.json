From left are head coach Jeff Kaye, Matt Grossman, Ramsey Little, McCarthy, Thomas, John Lacy, Chris Stone and Will Meyer. \n\"It feels really amazing to win the championship and break the record,\" Grossman said. \"Breaking a course record anywhere is a great accomplishment, but I was especially happy to break it at Branch Brook because we’ve had so many races there over the years, and it was a pretty tough record to beat. \n\"Going into the race my first goal was to try to win in whatever time was necessary. But when the race went out very fast for the first mile (4:50) I decided to go for the record. I think not racing (in the) Shore Coaches (meet on Oct. 3) definitely helped my legs to feel fresher but taking the SATs was major reason for my decision not to run there.\" \nThree of Grossman’s teammates - Will Meyer, Chris Stone and Ramsey Little - also placed in the top 10 to earn medals. \nMeyer, a senior, placed fourth in 16:42.2. Stone, a senior, came in sixth in 16:45.7. \nLittle, a freshman, finished seventh in 16:49.9. \nSeniors Ethan Thomas and Owen McCarthy also contributed to Millburn’s team score. \nThomas finished 17th in the 69-runner field in 17:14.1 McCarthy took 19th place in 17:16.2. \n\"On the team side we also had an excellent race,\" said Grossman, who extended the Millers’ streak of conference title race individual victories to five years. \n\"Getting to repeat as conference champions in both the varsity and JV races again is a great feeling. It’s a real testament to how deep our team is this year. Specifically Ramsey Little, who’s a freshman, had a great race with a big PR. As a team we’re really looking forward to trying to win more races later in the season.\" \nMillburn took the team title with 34 points. \nColumbia High School (73 points) came in second followed by West Orange High School (104 points), Seton Hall Preparatory School (111 points) and Montclair Kimberley Academy (117 points). \nVisit www.essexcountytrack.bizland.com to view complete meet results. \nEmail: connellyj@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:16:09.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
