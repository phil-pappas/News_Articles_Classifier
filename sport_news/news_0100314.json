(John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nLinebacker Ryan Kerrigan left Sunday’s game with a fractured right hand and did not return. \nKerrigan, who is tied for first on the team with 3.5 sacks, injured his hand late in the first quarter and went to the locker room to receive X-rays. Shortly after the start of the second quarter, he was ruled out for a return. He came back to the sideline wearing shorts and a T-shirt. \nCoach Jay Gruden said that the linebacker has an appointment set up with a specialist for some time on Monday. \nKerrigan has never missed a game in his four previous seasons, starting all 64 from 2011-14 and all seven this season. The 16th overall pick of the 2011 draft, Kerrigan signed a five-year, $57.5 million contract extension on the eve of this year’s training camp. \nInside linebacker Perry Riley Jr. also left the game with an injury. He strained a lower leg muscle in the second half. Riley missed two games earlier this season with a strained calf. Cornerback Bashaud Breeland strained a hamstring late in the fourth quarter. Breeland injured himself while making a tackle that prevented Tampa Bay running back Doug Martin from scoring a touchdown. Martin gained 49 yards on his run and Breeland tackled him on the 5-yard-line. Washington held the Bucs to a field goal. \nLinebacker Keenan Robinson left the game with a rib injury late in the first half, but returned in the second half. \nLeft tackle Trent Williams sprained a finger, but missed only a couple of plays. Safety Dashon Goldson suffered what coach Jay Gruden described as a nose contusion, but also returned to finish the game. Mike Jones covers the Washington Redskins for The Washington Post.
