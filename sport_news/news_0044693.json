The 30-year-old posed for photos with all of them after the ceremony. \nRonaldo’s next chance to officially break the record is tomorrow’s La Liga match at Atletico Madrid. \nHe needed a mere 308 matches across seven seasons to equal Raul’s tally of 323, amassed in 741 games over 16 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:01:04.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
