Cox/Getty Images) \nThe Washington Redskins lost another winnable game on Sunday, allowing the Atlanta Falcons to put together a 10-play, 80-yard touchdown drive with less than a minute to go. Then Kirk Cousin’s threw an interception in overtime that was returned for a touchdown, dropping them to a 2-3 record and once again allowing onlookers to point the finger of blame in his direction. \n[ Playing the blame game on Kirk Cousins’s INT ] \nThey shouldn’t. This team has a lot of problems on offense, but the running game is much more concerning than anything Cousins is doing right now. \nHeading into Week 5, the Redskins were ranked 23rd in Football Outsiders’ Defense-adjusted Value Over Average ( minus-6.1 percent ), which breaks down every single play of the NFL season, assigning each play a value based on both total yards and yards towards a first down . \nIn all cases, 0% represents league-average. A positive DVOA represents a situation that favors the offense, while a negative DVOA represents a situation that favors the defense. \nWe can further break this down to its passing and running components, where the Redskins rank 11th (24.2 percent) and 22nd (minus-16.3 percent), respectively. So even after factoring in Cousins’s mistakes through the four weeks of the season, Washington’s passing game is still above average. But their running attack continues to disappoint. \nAccording to the game charters at Pro Football Focus, Cousins is the 12th best passer among 31 quarterbacks playing at least half their team’s snaps. Alfred Morris, their lead back, ranks 42 out of 58. Matt Jones, their highly prized rookie, ranks 52nd and Chris Thompson is dead last. \nThe Redskins ran the ball 67 times on first down during the season’s first four weeks, averaging four yards per carry and getting enough yards for a first down 13.4 percent of the time. Atlanta had allowed 4.1 yards per carry and 21.7 percent first-down conversion on first-down carries up until that point. On Sunday, Washington averaged two yards on 19 first-down carries with just one first down (6.3 percent). \nFailing to move the chains coupled with the second lowest percentage of runs on third or fourth down, two yards or less to go, that achieved a first down or touchdown ( 33 percent ) is why Washington has the seventh highest three-and-out percentage (26.2 percent). \nThis ineptitude is also a function of the offensive line, which is rated as the second worst behind the Tampa bay Buccaneers for run blocking . Only rookie Brandon Scherff and Shawn Lauvao have received positive grades from Pro Football Focus with runs behind the tight end, left tackle, left guard, center and right tackle all in the red in terms of PFF ratings. \nAnd when that same offensive line doesn’t help keep pressure off Cousins, things start to go south. His passer rating drops from 105.7 to 32.8 under pressure. \nIs that decline in rating a result of Cousins’s poor judgment? Absolutely, but you also have to give him praise for his awareness which has limited him to just a 9.1 percent sack rate under pressure , the fourth lowest in the NFL. \nThe best way to get the passing game on track is through a strong running game, and despite a talented backfield of Morris, Jones and Thompson, the team is not able to get it done. And until they do, the Redskins will continue to flounder.
