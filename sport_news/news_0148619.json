Fells remains hospitalized. \nMRSA is caused by a type of staph bacteria that's \"become resistant to many of the antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections,\" according to the Mayo clinic. It is contagious and considered serious. \nFells was dealing with an ankle injury last week before developing an infection in his foot. He did not travel with the team to Buffalo despite being listed as questionable. He spent the weekend in the hospital undergoing multiple procedures to get rid of the infections, a person with knowledge of the situation told NJ Advance Media. \nRELATED : NFC Power Poll: Giants move up; Eagles move down \nThere remains concern about Fells' health and foot. \n\"It was very unfortunate with Daniel,\" coach Tom Coughlin said on Monday. \"It went from early in the week being a junkie ankle to a serious situation. I just talked to him a little while ago, he feels upbeat about it. He's just looking forward to getting things under control so he can get out of the hospital.\" \nMRSA can be contagious. Several Tampa Bay Buccaneers players, including former Giants kick Lawrence Tynes, contracted it in 2013. MRSA essentially ended the careers of Tynes and former Bucs guard Carl Nicks. \nTynes is reportedly suing the NFL for $20 million. \nFells, 32, will be placed on season-ending injured reserve , likely as early as Tuesday. There is a good chance he never plays again. \nIn hopes of preventing further cases, the Giants have scrubbed their facility clean. They're following the guidelines presented to teams in such situations. \n\"We are working with infectious disease specialists, and we have defined protocols that we are following in consultation with the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network and local infectious disease specialists,\" team spokesman Pat Hanlon said in a statement. \"Those protocols are being followed carefully.\" \nThe Bucs previously hired an outside firm to sanitize their facilities. They also reportedly invested in a \"massive air purifier and required players to shower before migrating from the locker room and cover their cuts and abrasions with watertight bandages before submitting to hydrotherapy.\" \nJordan Raanan may be reached at jraanan@njadvancemedia.com .
