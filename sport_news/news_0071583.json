But it's difficult to deny him a spot in the starting gate. \nRiker's decisive win in the Grey earned him a spot in the $2-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile, one of the most anticipated dashes on the Cup card as it provides an early look at next year's Triple Crown contenders. Most encouraging for Gonzalez is that the colt seems to improve with each start, something he will have to do again at Keeneland Race Course when he faces the top young colts in the game. \n\"He keeps getting better every time he races,\" said Gonzalez, who captured the 2010 Queen's Plate with Big Red Mike. \"It's been wonderful to see that progression. I was really impressed by how he galloped out after the Grey. \n\"We're obviously thrilled with how he's raced. I have a very good feeling about this horse.\" \nBased on the pre-entries announced by Breeders' Cup officials, Riker is just one of many Canadian-connected horses headed to Kentucky for racing's two-day, season-ending championship, including a shed row full from Canada's perennial trainer of the year, Mark Casse. \nWhat follows is a race-by-race look of the Keeneland-bound Canadian crew, including those horses owned by Canadians as well as those bred here: \nJUVENILE TURF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:56:12.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
