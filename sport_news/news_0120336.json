San Francisco snapped a four game losing streak with a 5-point win over Baltimore. \nSan Francisco 49ers coach Jim Tomsula has given a lukewarm assessment of Jarryd Hayne as a running back. \nThe former NRL star came on the field for numerous plays in the 49ers' 25-20 victory against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, but he was never handed the ball. \nOn one play Hayne failed to block two Raven defenders who sacked 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. THEARON W HENDERSON/GETTY IMAGES \nJarryd Hayne had his third fumble of the season against the Balitimore Ravens. \n\"Improving,\" Tomsula said on Tuesday (NZ time) when asked about Hayne and the 49ers' other rookie running back, Mike Davis. \n\"Are they as good as our starter? No. \n\"They're not there yet, but they are improving and we like both of them.\" \nThe 49ers' running back stocks were depleted with the team's star at the position, Carlos Hyde, playing with a foot injury while Reggie Bush has appeared briefly in just three of the season's six games. \nIn those three games, Bush failed to stay on the field, limping off with a calf strain. \n\"Carlos Hyde to me is a special runner,\" Tomsula said. \nBush is expected to be healthy and back up Hyde for Friday's crucial game with arch-rival the Seattle Seahawks. \nHayne, who also plays punt returner, is expected to be the third running back option and Davis will likely be dropped from the 46-man squad to play the Seahawks. \n\"Right now I'm very optimistic where Reggie is,\" Tomsula said. \nHayne had his third fumble of the season when a Ravens player was able to claw the ball out of his hands on his only punt return of the day. \nHayne said he was \"devastated\" by the latest fumble, although a 49ers' team-mate did recover the loose ball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:37:59.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
