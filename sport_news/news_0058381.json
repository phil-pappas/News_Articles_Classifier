But we want to find a new coach in our own time and we are currently orientating ourselves,” said Gladbach sports director Max Eberl following their draw in Turin. \n“The new coach could also be Andre Schubert. I never ruled that out.” \nOnly days earlier, Eberl had hinted Schubert was their only candidate, saying: “Andre’s work is outstanding and argument enough. We are currently not negotiating with other coaches.” \nGladbach finished third last season under Favre but lost their way at the start of the current campaign following the departure of Germany internationals Max Kruse and Christoph Kramer in the close season. \nSchubert has quickly applied his exciting brand of attacking football and despite missing the injured Herrmann, Nico Schulz and Martin Stranzl, has led his team from last place to 10th in the space of a month. \nNew arrival Lars Stindl is finally hitting top form and midfielder Granit Xhaka has taken more of a lead role, while teenager Mahmoud Dahoud, a whirlwind in midfield, is the season’s early revelation. \n“I am just enjoying it at the moment,” said the soft-spoken Schubert, a former Germany national youth team coach and who also coached Paderborn and St Pauli in the lower divisions. “It is just a joy to work with the team.” \nSchalke will be no pushovers though, with coach Andre Breitenreiter, also a Paderborn alumnus, having made a fine start in his first season in charge. \nThe Ruhr valley club are third on 19 points, one point behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund and eight off leaders Bayern Munich, having won five of their last six matches. \nBayern, who set a league record last week with their ninth straight win to start the campaign, take on Cologne while Dortmund host Augsburg. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:26:03.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
