In fact, things only seemed to get worse, as the (3-1) New York Jets beat Miami 27-14. \nThe Dolphins defense set an ugly tone, allowing the New York Jets to score a touchdown with ease on the first drive of the game. Chris Ivory ran in a three yard touchdown to cap off a 3 play, 73 yard touchdown drive. The defense was able to hold the Jets to field goals until Ryan Fitzpatrick found Eric Decker for a 10 yard touchdown in the final minute of the 2nd half to take a 20-7 lead into halftime. \nThe Jets added a touchdown from Zac Stacy in the 2nd half, in a game where the Jets offensive line completely outmatched a Dolphins defensive line that features highly touted offseason signing NDamukong Suh. Suh had already been a disapointment, only mustering up one sack and a few tackles over the first three games. Today he managed only two tackles, one being for a loss. \nMeanwhile the Dolphins offense failed to muster up a single first down through the first four drives, until Ryan Tannehill finally found Jake Stoneburner for an 8 yard touchdown after two straight Jets pass interference penalties got the Dolphins into the redzone. Tannehill wasn't able to muster up any offense in the second half until he found Kenny Stills for a 10 yard touchdown to cap off a 4 play 37 yard drive. Two late endzone interceptions from the Jets sealed the deal, as Tannehill finished 19 of 44 passing for 198 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interception, and was sacked 3 times. \nDolphins head coach Joe Philbin is now officially on the hot seat with a loss in London, having not posted a winning record over his first three years as head coach. \nWatch the second half on CBS12, then we'll break it down with the players in the locker room tonight on Fins Final at 11 PM on CBS12. Dolphins drop to 1-3 with 27-14 loss to Jets in London \nSunday, October 4 2015, 04:51 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:29:39.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
