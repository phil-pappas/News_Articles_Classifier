(AP) - A former Lansing-area gymnastics instructor accused of criminal sexual conduct in connection with a relationship involving a 14-year-old female student is expected to face trial on reduced charges. \nThe Lansing State Journal reports (http://on.lsj.com/1PD5KLx ) Mikael Frutin waived his right to a hearing Thursday in District Court in East Lansing to determine whether there’s enough evidence to send the case to trial. \nIn court, the prosecution amended the complaint to drop first-degree criminal sexual conduct charges and add third-degree CSC charges. \nFrutin now faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted instead of up to life. His lawyer Nicholas Leydorf declined to comment afterward. \nPolice started investigating the case in 2014 and say none of the alleged crimes happened at the gymnastics center in Delhi Township where Frutin worked. \n___ \nInformation from: Lansing State Journal, http://www.lansingstatejournal.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:05:03.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
