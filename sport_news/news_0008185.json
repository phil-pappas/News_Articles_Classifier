He puts so much preparation and so much pressure on himself to do well and to be a big part of this team, and I think he’s done a great job the last few years here.”\nMany expected Hackenberg to compete for the Heisman Trophy in 2014 after a freshman season in 2013 in which he passed for 2,955 yards and 20 touchdowns and led the Nittany Lions to a 7-5 record under Bill O’Brien.\nHe eclipsed 2,900 yards and again led Penn State to a winning record (7-6) in his second season, but fell short of the lofty expectations, finishing the year with 15 interceptions and 12 touchdown passes.\nAfter a season-opening loss to Temple in which Hackenberg was sacked 10 times and Penn State amassed just 180 total yards, the Nittany Lions (5-1, 1-0 Big Ten) have started to pass, catch and block like their old selves, and Hackenberg has thrown just two interceptions.\n>> Get the most out of college football season, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \n“I’m a guy who likes to push the ball down the field,” he said. “It has resulted in some big plays for us and I’ve missed a couple, but I think that’s a big part of our offense.\n“It’s just getting older and learning from the year before, seeing things differently and kind of understanding where to go with the football. I think that’s helped limit (interceptions).”\nThe result of a more cohesive, mistake-free offense has been five consecutive victories — although all at Beaver Stadium — and the Nittany Lions’ first 5-1 start since 2011.\n“It’s the same that it’s been since we’ve been here: Our focus has been getting the pieces of the puzzle around Christian,” second-year coach James Franklin said.\n”It’s getting the offensive line developed and ready to play and playing with confidence. It’s about receivers and running backs and having a consistent running game and protection.”\nFranklin pointed to the Lions’ 2014 Pinstripe Bowl victory over Boston College, in which Hackenberg passed for 371 yards and four touchdowns, as an example of what can happen when those pieces come together.\nIn order to achieve a similar result against an Ohio State defense that has allowed just 17.3 points per game, Hackenberg said he will need to get his weapons involved early.\nAlthough Penn State’s winning streak hasn’t put Hackenberg in this year’s Heisman conversation, he needs 195 passing yards to break Zack Mills’ 11-year-old school record of 7,212, a record that took Mills four seasons to set.\nA victory over the top-ranked Buckeyes would mean a big competition won for Hackenberg, but he said he’s more focused on day-to-day improvement for himself and the team.\n“I don’t really look at ceilings, because I don’t believe in limits and ceilings and I feel like I can continue to get better each and every day,” Hackenberg said.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \n“Understanding you do have limitations, and limitations are out there, but you can find ways to outplay those and outsmart those at times — that’s my goal.”\naerickson@dispatch.com \n@AndrewRErickson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:21:03.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
