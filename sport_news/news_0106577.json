Tennessee lost all three matchups in the “Derek Dooley era” and current head coach Butch Jones hasn’t managed to squeak out a win against Nick Saban’s squad either. \nThings have changed in the last few years, though. Jones has managed to churn out back to back top five recruiting classes and despite a 3-3 record, he has clearly given team 119 a boost of confidence, and rightfully so, Tennessee is on the right track after their last victory over the Georgia Bulldogs. \n“Now, that is the standard we have set for ourselves,” linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin said on Monday. “If we come back with anything less than a win, that is unacceptable. In previous years, we didn’t know where our talents matched up or we didn’t know how to win games, but we have won games here. We are just trying to keep building our program and keep building the standards and expectations.” \nThat belief was shaken by three losses this season that saw the Vols blow 13+ point leads to Oklahoma, Florida and Arkansas. The win over Georgia was a much-needed reminder of the progress the Vols have made, however. The Vols have proven that they should have the ability to play with anybody even the highly touted Crimson Tide. \n“I understand the importance of the rivalry,” said Butch Jones. “This game means a lot to both institutions, both universities, our fan bases and our players. It means a lot. I have spoken about getting the rivalry back to making it relevant again and being in these football games for us. We are going to have to play great, mistake-free football to get the game into the fourth quarter. Once you get a game into the fourth quarter, as we all know, anything can happen. In terms of a couple of years ago, I think it’s just a complete building of our football program, and there is a belief in winning. There is also deserving to win, and it’s more than just wanting or hoping to win. It’s investing to win. It’s the belief that you’re going to win. \nThe Vols travel to Bryant-Denny Stadium to face the Crimson Tide on Oct. 24th for the annual “Third Week in October” clash. Kickoff is at 2:30 p.m. CDT.
