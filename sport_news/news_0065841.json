Port Isabel also received rushing touchdowns from Travis Camacho, Ivan Gonzalez, and Jorge Escobar in the District 16-4A victory. \nThe Tarpons’ defense did the rest, limiting the Bears and giving the offensive unit good field position all evening. \n“We feel like we’re getting better every week,” Port Isabel coach Monty Stumbaugh said. “We were able to run the ball well, and we played really good defense (Friday). We kept it simple and we did what we do, and fortunately we we’re able to win.” \nLOS FRESNOS 46, RIVERA 6: Los Fresnos jumped out to a first-quarter lead and easily defeated Rivera on Friday night at Leo Aguilar Stadium in Los Fresnos. \nThe Falcons used a mix of passes and runs in rainy conditions to take an early advantage, and they had the game in hand by halftime. \n“The boys came out and executed really well,” Los Fresnos coach Clint Finley said. “We played a good game and jumped on them quick, and that was key to our victory. You can’t let those guys hang around. They play hard, and they can give you some trouble. \n“They jumped on us last year, and we just wanted to make sure we took care of business this year.” \nDONNA HIGH 42, PORTER 7: Porter matched Donna High with a touchdown in the first quarter but didn’t get anything else in a District 32-5A loss to the Redskins at Bennie La Prade Stadium in Donna. \nCowboys’ running back Jorge Gutierrez scored the lone touchdown for Porter. \n“They were tough,” Donna coach Ramiro Leal said of Porter. “Their offensive line is huge, and we got off to a slow start. Our possessions were limited. But what helped us out is they went for it on every fourth down and didn’t capitalize on any. The defense stepped up for us.” \nAmonte Bowen, Edward Dougherty, Paul Guerra and Jonathan Sandoval all scored for the Redskins (6-2, 5-0 32-5A). Sophomore EJ Alvarado had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown. \nThe Redskins won their sixth game in a row and next face city rival Donna North. A win gives Donna High at least a share of the district title, something it hasn’t won since 2007. \nFor more high school sports news,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:29:10.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
