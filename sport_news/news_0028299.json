They've been able to set their pitching rotation, even as they go 2-1 instead of 1-2 with Jon Lester starting Game 1 and Jake Arrieta in Game 2. The Mets had no such luxury. The Cubs also are rested while the Mets had to fly from the West Coast after eliminating the Dodgers in Game 5 of the division series.\nKeep the power on: The Cubs hit 12 home runs in their first five postseason games, including the wild-card playoff. The Mets have hit 7 homers. Getting runs in bunches helps anytime, but especially in the playoffs.\nKeep it clean: The Cubs made 3 errors in their five playoff games. Overall, they've taken pretty good care of the ball. Javier Baez takes over for Addison Russell at shortstop. Baez made an error in Game 3 of the NLDS against the Cardinals, but he has been a smooth fielder. Manager Joe Maddon says he's all about pitching and defense.\n-- Bruce Miles\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
