Moore had taken the season off to care for Katie during her nine-month battle against the disease, and he tried to make the best out of a tragic situation by setting up a foundation in her memory, The Katie Moore Foundation, following her death.\nAdChoices Moore more recently inspired fans by proving you can find love again when he remarried this summer. According to the New York Post, Moore met his new wife, Mary Hirst, through a friend last year, and they were engaged on Christmas Eve 2014 after four months of dating.\n\"She was living in Boston at the time [they started dating],\" Moore told the Post . \"She would take the train down to catch games. It quickly developed from there.\"\nLike Moore, Hirst is a former Harvard University athlete, as she ran track-and-field. Moore played hockey for the Crimson from 1999-2003.\nThe couple tied the knot in July in a Tennessee wedding, which featured Southern comfort food and a moonshine bar. Lest anyone think Moore has forgotten his first wife, the Rangers' center returned from his honeymoon in time to host Smashfest in Toronto, an annual pingpong tournament to benefit The Katie Moore Foundation.\nSmashfest has been highly successful in each of the four iterations of the event and has raised a few hundred thousand dollars for research of rare cancers.\nThe happy couple -- we wish them the best:\nNew York Ranger Dominic Moore got remarried this summer — and other team secrets http://t.co/IOmAZOIWS9\n— David Hale (@DavidHa51596823) October 7, 2015 (h/t New York Post )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "https://twitter.com/DavidHa51596823/status/651699245511241728", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/07/new-york-ranger-dominic-moore-got-remarried-this-summer-and-other-team-secrets/", "http://www.foxsports.com/nhl/story/dominic-moore-holds-fourth-annual-ping-pong-tournament-to-benefit-late-wife-s-foundation-072115", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://t.co/IOmAZOIWS9"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:43:35.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
