Comment By Keith Hyatt/Special to The Oak Ridger Oakridger - Oak Ridge, TN By Keith Hyatt/Special to The Oak Ridger Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 6:48 PM By Keith Hyatt/Special to The Oak Ridger Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 6:48 PM Oak Ridge traveled across Solway Bridge on Friday night to a dismal, rainy Beaver Creek for a Region 3-5A game. The Wildcats needed the win to keep pace in the district race and stay on track for the playoffs. Karns High School was coming off an open date, and the Beavers’ offense featured standout running back Devin Harper, a 6-1, 235 lb. senior who is an Oklahoma State commit. Oak Ridge won the toss and deferred to the second half. Karns took the kickoff and started on the 30, but a couple of Harper runs weren’t enough to secure the home team a first down so the Beavers were forced to punt. Oak Ridge would take over at the 46 in great field position and with the hard running of TJ Allison and Davon Middleton completed the drive — with Middleton getting the touchdown on a six-yard run. Senior Brandon Nickle’s extra point was good and the Wildcats led 7-0 with 9:20 left in the first quarter. The Beavers would pick up one first down before again being forced to punt at the 42. Oak Ridge responded with a 75-yard drive with Allison scoring this time on a nice 52-yard run. Nickle’s point again was good and it was Oak Ridge up 14-0 with 4:52 left in the first period of play. Karns would go three and out and punt, but the Wildcats, bitten by a penalty and incompletion, would have to punt it back. Karns was able to obtain good field position at their 47, but the Beavers wouldn’t be able to convert a fourth down. So Oak Ridge, taking over at their 48, once again saw Allison break it up the middle for a 52-yard touchdown run that would help extend the lead to 21-0 with 13 seconds left in the quarter. *** The second quarter saw the Beavers first possession end in a shanked punt that would give the Wildcats the ball at the Beaver 28. The ’Cats would come up empty though on this possession as they couldn’t convert a fourth down. Karns went three and out and punted to Oak Ridge at the Beaver 40; but after a Middleton run to the 28, a fumble would end the drive on the next play at the 27. Karns again stalled and punted, and Oak Ridge — taking over at its own 2 —would see 14-year-old Wildcat Jordan Graham get a big run to the Beaver 4. Jaret Miner went in for the touchdown two plays later and, with the point after, the Wildcats would up their lead to 28-0 with 4:14 left in the half. Karns would go to the air the next possession and a couple of nice catches set up the first Beaver touchdown on a 25-yard pass. The extra point was good and the lead was trimmed to 28-7 with 2:06 left in the first half of the ballgame. Page 2 of 3 - Oak Ridge would get a nice return to the Karns 43, but Logan Fadnek’s pass intended for 6-6, 255 lb. wide receiver Darel Middleton was picked off at the Beaver 8. Karns would go three and out and punt with 11 seconds left in the half, and the clock was allowed to run out as the ball was downed. *** The third quarter had the Beavers coming out trying an onside kick and a squib kick, which Allison picked up and returned to the Karns 13. Gavin Warrington would get the score on three tough runs, and with the extra point it was now 35-7 Oak Ridge with 10:05 left in the third. Karns would launch an 80-yard drive on the next possession as several completions and a pass interference call would set the Beavers up at the Wildcat 17, where Harper would break up the middle for a touchdown — narrowing the lead to 35-14 with 6:29 left in the third quarter. Oak Ridge would start at its own 26 after a penalty on the kickoff and Graham would break a big run to the Beaver 20, but another flag would set the Wildcats back to the 35. Allison then got a big run to the Karns 15 and Jordan Dunbar connected with Miner over the middle to the Beaver 1. Allison would get the score on a one-yard run, and the extra point gave the Wildcats a 42-14 lead with 5:43 left in the third quarter. Another penalty would have Nickle kicking off from the 25 and still reaching the end zone with his kick to give Karns the ball on its own 20. Warrington came up with an interception at the Beaver 48, and the Wildcats reached the Beaver 36 before the drive stalled on penalties and incompletions. The Beavers would go three and out and turn the ball back over to the Wildcats as the quarter ended. *** The fourth quarter had the Wildcat drive continuing that started at the Karns 42. Dunbar hit Allison on a swing pass for another TD, and the extra point would get the clock running at 49-14 with 10:24 left in the game. Karns would move into Oak Ridge territory on its next possession, but a nice interception by defensive standout Kyndall Clark at the Oak Ridge 8 was returned to the 28 to set up the last Wildcat drive. Fadnek would turn in a nice run into Beaver territory, then a completion and run by Darel Middleton to the Beaver 20 set up sophomore running back Christian Bivens’ one-yard run a few plays later. Junior Noah Calhoun would kick the last extra point and that would be the final score of 56-14. With the win, Oak Ridge is now 6-1 overall and 3-1 in district competition, while Karns falls to 1-5 and 0-3. The Wildcats finally return home to Blankenship Field to face old foe McMinn County (3-2, 2-1 Region 4-5A) in a non-district game before going on to an open date.
