I'm really excited to be back.\" \nWilliams added that the Hopman Cup was excellent preparation for the Australian Open. \n\"In 2016 I want to play doubles in Australia so it will be really exciting for me to get there, play some doubles and get some little experience at the Hopman Cup,\" she said. \nWilliams has not played since suffering a shock semi-final defeat to Italian Roberta Vinci at the US Open last month which ended her bid for a rare calendar grand slam. \nShe pulled out of two events in China earlier this month, we well as next week's WTA Finals in Singapore, citing the need to rest after a year spent carrying injuries. \nWilliams will be joined in the Jan. 3-9 Hopman Cup field by Briton Andy Murray and controversial Australian Nick Kyrgios. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:24:12.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
