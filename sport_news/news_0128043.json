His hole-in-one helped him to a final round 69, the best score of any round.\n\"I hit my shot and executed it pretty well and landed it on top of the pin,\" Duke said. \"Assistant coach Zach Day was standing behind the green practicing a swing so I thought I overshot the green. I was all worked up thinking I wasn't even close, and then he met me halfway on the green and said 'congrats on your hole-in-one.' It was pretty insane. You kind of live for those moments. It was pretty awesome.\"\nIndividuals\n2 – Wade Duke E 144 (75, 69)\nT8 – Connor Hogan +9 153 (81, 72)\nT12 – Mike Herperger +12 156 (80, 76)\nT12 – Declan Illingsworth +12 156 (79, 77)\n15 – Cole Ranson +13 157 (76, 81)\nT18 – Keith Brooks +16 160 (77, 83)\nT40 – T.J.
