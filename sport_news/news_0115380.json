In fact, it wasn't really served at all. The Patriots beat the Colts but they didn't destroy the Colts. That was disappointing. The Cardinals and Bruce Arians couldn't even manage to beat the Mike Vick -led Steelers! So a Virginia Tech product stole Arians' thunder. Irony is such a delicious beast.\nBut it's OK. We still managed to go 3-2 on our best bets for Week 6. Two-straight winning weeks for the first time this season and let's LET IT RIDE BABY. Or something. Kind of a “meh” week but I dig the picks we've got on the slate. \nChiefs +2 vs. Steelers: How in the holy hell are the Steelers only two-point faves here? Yeah, the Steelers have Landry Jones but he looked GOOD in late action for Pittsburgh last week. He's got weapons too. Le'Veon Bell , Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant , who returned in Week 6 and looked dynamic. The Chiefs are without a semblance of a rushing attack, Jeremy Maclin is banged up and Travis Kelce is the only weapon. The Steelers are TOO obvious. Sometimes that's all you need. The Chiefs will STUN THE WORLD on Sunday. (USATSI) Titans +6.5 vs Falcons : Another pick where I'm going against the grain (I think). The public is all over Atlanta (90 percent against the spread), largely because Marcus Mariota will miss the game and Zach Mettenberger gets the start. The Titans were hammered by the Dolphins last week and the Falcons are coming off 10 days of rest after a weird loss to the Saints. \nLions +2.5 vs. Vikings : A home dog in a divisional game? Yes please. The Vikings are a better team than they've looked throughout the year (and they haven't looked bad) but they're not explosive on offense yet. Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson found something last week against the Bears and it's time to let them keep opening up the offense and chunking the ball all over the place. If they can pull this game off the questionable Seahawks loss on the batted-ball play really starts to sting. \nChargers -3.5 vs. Raiders : The Raiders are surprisingly bad out of the bye, going 1-11 straight up in their last 12 games. Yikes. They're 3-9 against the spread in that stretch as well. Don't sleep on this game as a MASSIVE outing for Philip Rivers and Co. They took a tough loss against Green Bay and they're 2-4 on the season, but this is a MUST-WIN GAME if San Diego wants a shot at the second AFC wild card. No it's not too early in the season. Rivers is dialed and the Bolts might just abandon the run and let him wing it all over the place. Tight ends carve up the Raiders and San Diego has two good ones in Antonio Gates and Lardarius Green. Jason Verrett is capable of limiting Amari Cooper . Old friend David Amerson is not capable of stopping Keenan Allen (the two know each other from high school). \nJets +8.5 @ Patriots : Betting against Tom Brady and the Patriots in a home divisional game is a touch terrifying and it's possible New England bludgeons the Jets. But the Pats offensive line is banged up and the Jets probably sport the best defensive line in football right now. Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie can limit the Patriots receivers (but probably not Rob Gronkowski ). Jets OC Chan Gailey, while coaching the Bills, once beat the Patriots! Unfortunately he was 1-5 in three years in Buffalo with a 19.5-points average margin of loss. Gulp. Todd Bowles' defense will make up for it.\nLast Week ATS : 8-6\nLast Week Best Bets : 3-2\nSeason ATS : 46-45\nSeason Best Bets : 19-11 Topics: Amari Cooper , Antonio Brown , Antonio Cromartie , Antonio Gates , Bell,Le'Veon , Calvin Johnson , Darrelle Revis , David Amerson , Jason Verrett , Jeremy Maclin , Keenan Allen , Landry Jones , Marcus Mariota , Martavis Bryant , Matthew Stafford , Mike Vick , Philip Rivers , Rob Gronkowski , Tom Brady , Travis Kelce , Zach Mettenberger , NFL Picks , Will Brinson , Atlanta Falcons , Detroit Lions , Minnesota Vikings , New England Patriots , New York Jets , Oakland Raiders , San Diego Chargers , Tennessee Titans , NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:04:37.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
