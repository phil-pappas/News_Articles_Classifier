Still, there were further goals to be scored, and this time Gamal - brought on as a half time substitute instead of Morsi - put his name on the scoresheet with just seconds left.\nAgain, Gaber was the man who assisted in the goal, which was largely similar to Kouka's second, but this time it was an unmarked Gamal who found the net from inside the box.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:32:10.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
