On the next drive, Rene Ortega scored on a 16-yard run. After the defense recovered a fumble, Ortega hit Pete Perez on a 20-yard touchdown pass to take a commanding lead that held up. \n“We executed a little bit better,” Los Fresnos coach Clint Finley said of his team’s halftime adjustments on offense. “We came back to some plays we thought we could have had early but we didn’t hit. We hit them a couple times. The boys just came out and executed. They were hungry, it was a big game.” \nHarlingen South took a 7-0 lead after they grinded down the clock during its first drive. The Hawks used nearly six minutes, and Adrian Torres scored on a 13-yard run. \nLos Fresnos stalled on its first drive but settled for a 25-yard field goal by Armando Izaguirre to cut into the lead. The Falcons quickly took the lead a few minutes later when Ortega found Perez on a 27-yard strike for a 10-7 lead. \nOrtega rushed for 58 yards and one touchdown. He threw for 232 yards and two touchdowns, both to Perez, who had five catches for 66 yards for Los Fresnos. \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
