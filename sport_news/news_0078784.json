We’d have loved to have won this tournament, but we are very happy with our day.” \nThe Hawks (30-6) appeared to have the first set in hand, but Cedar Falls (33-4) battled back from a 23-18 deficit, and erased three set points to steal it. \n“We lost concentration there for just a little while,” said Prairie’s Kate Busswitz. “Then after we lost that set, we weren’t sure where go to from there.” \nPrairie righted the ship for a bit, taking a 6-2 lead in the second set, but the Tigers went on a 10-2 run and took control for good. \n“We really came together as a team,” said the Tigers’ Alicia Harrington. “We got behind, but we had each other’s backs. I’m very proud of what we accomplished today.” \nThe tournament featured eight ranked teams, and those eight teams made up the championship bracket. \nThree of the final four teams were Metro schools, but Cedar Falls was the last team standing. \nCedar Falls swept No. 11 Linn-Mar, 25-19, 25-12, in the semifinals. Prairie outlasted No. 9 Cedar Rapids Kennedy, 20-25, 25-22, 15-12. \nKennedy (26-9) held an 11-10 edge in the final set after three consecutive kills by Anna Fluent, but Prairie scored the next four points to turn the tide for good. \n“All season long, we’ve been wanting to play each other,” Busswitz said of the Hawks and the Cougars. “We know those girls. It’s an intracity rival.” \nSince Day 1, this has shaped up as potentially the best season in Prairie’s history. The Hawks upset No. 1 Bettendorf in the MVC-MAC Challenge in August. They have been ranked high ever since. They won their first divisional title since 2008, and now they’ve reached the MVC tournament finals. \n“If we don’t have confidence now ... ,” Stecklein said. “We got better today. We played some of the best teams in the state, and we made it to the final match.” \nPrairie swept its three pool matches, then got past No. 13 Dubuque Hempstead in a three-set quarterfinal. \nKennedy won its pool, then handled No. 14 Iowa City High, 25-11, 25-16, in the quarterfinals. Linn-Mar got to the semifinals by handling No. 12 Iowa City West, 25-23, 25-14 in the first round of bracket play. \nMISSISSIPPI VALLEY CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT \nAt Dubuque Senior & Dubuque Hempstead \nPool A \nTeams — 1.
