They have grown a lot throughout the year, but having me back and being vocal out there and yelling out what I see will help everybody. We will be able to play faster without thinking too much.” \nFantuz and running back C.J. Gable were hurt in the same game on Aug. 3 against the Toronto Argonauts. Gable also suffered an elbow injury, though it appears he is not on the same timetable as Fantuz to get back on the active roster. \n“I would say right now Andy probably has a better chance than C.J. (to play on Sunday in Montreal against the Alouettes),” Ticats head coach Kent Austin said. “Neither one is for sure and neither one is definitely out. Everybody heals at different paces.” \nFantuz, who has missed the past nine games, has been wearing a brace on his right elbow and said he was “pretty optimistic” about playing in Montreal. \nHis participation is more important as slotback Bakari Grant is unlikely to play. Grant has not been practising because of an undisclosed injury, though Austin said it was not a long-term problem. \nAustin, meanwhile, officially signed offensive lineman Ryan Bomben on Thursday to a three-year contract extension through 2018. Later in the day, the CFL announced that offensive lineman Joel Figueroa had been fined an undisclosed amount for unnecessary roughness against the Saskatchewan Roughriders last week. \nThough Austin never is one to place too much emphasis on one player over another, he’s not going to diminish what Fantuz brings. Austin has had a handle on Fantuz’s talents since they worked together to help secure a Grey Cup with Saskatchewan in 2007. \n“He was always a guy who had a great understanding of the game, a great understanding of defences,” Austin said. “I have said he is one of the best time and space guys I have ever coached. \n“He just understands coverage, he understands spacing, he understands the timing he has to have to get to the areas we ask him to get to. He is a great adjuster as a route runner. He is like having another quarterback on the field. He has had a great career for a reason. \n“It will be good to have Andy back, for sure.” \nAt the age of 31 and having missed a significant chunk because of injury in the past two seasons as well, one might think Fantuz has started to contemplate the end of what has been a successful career. \nThat’s not the case, and we might have got a hint last season when Fantuz was named the most outstanding Canadian in the Grey Cup. This after a concussion caused a delay to the start of his regular season and a hamstring injury kept him out of three games in October and November. \n“I have learned a lot with this injury about the different ways of treatment and mindsets and the parts of the body,” Fantuz said. \n“I’m actually very excited for my growth as a player going forward once this heals up. I’m excited for getting better and continuing to progress and still having some of my better years in front of me. \n“You can win with your mind. You have to train properly, you have to know your body, you’re not getting any younger. You have to treat the body properly and fuel it more efficiently. I am learning those things.” \nWHAT A BALL \nThe fan in Justin Medlock found himself thinking like the professional athlete that he is during the Blue Jays’ emotional victory against the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night. \nMedlock, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats kicker/punter, had a seat in section 524 of the Rogers Centre along with teammates Hugh O’Neill and Matt Coates and watched the Jays advance to the American League Championship Series with a 6-3 win versus the Rangers. \n“I was thinking how crazy it would be to be a relief pitcher to come in and screw it up,” Medlock said. “But that’s what we do (as athletes with games on the line). You’ve been doing it for so many years, you know what it’s like. You don’t get nervous in those situations.” \nDuring his tenure with the Argos, Medlock shared a condo near the Rogers Centre with Josh Roenicke, a reliever with the Jays at the time. Roenicke, a two-sport athlete, had been a football teammate of Medlock at UCLA. \nThat Medlock witnessed in person Jose Bautista’s three-run home run in the seventh inning? \n“It was nuts, it was fun, exciting,” Medlock said. “Crazy.” \nTicats head coach Kent Austin, still at the office, had the game on TV. \n“It was awesome,” Austin said of Bautista’s homer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:08:33.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
