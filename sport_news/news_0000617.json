Shanta said since the CBI had registered a case against the Chief Minister for disproportionate assets and raided his houses, the Chief Minister should quit the office on moral grounds. He had no moral right to continue in the office. Talking to The Tribune on the phone from New Delhi this evening, Shanta Kumar said Virbhadra was a veteran Congress leader. He should leave the office paving way for the CBI for independent investigation into the cases pending against him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:04:51.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
