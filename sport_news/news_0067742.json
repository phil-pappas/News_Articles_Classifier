As Odom takes significant steps forward in his recovery, former teammate Metta World Peace is making it clear that there's too much of a crowd. \nWorld Peace told the Los Angeles Daily News that the hive of celebrities that's descended on Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas is causing Odom's own children to have to wait in line to see him. And while it's fine by World Peace that Odom's estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, is by his side, he says that her family doesn't need to be there: \"This is nothing against Khloe [Kardhasian],\" World Peace said, referring to the reality television star and Odom’s estranged wife. \"This is for the celebrities that are coming to see Lamar. They should know they’re taking time away from Lamar’s children.\" [...] \"The only Kardashian that needs to be there is Khloe,\" World Peace said. \"Not every Kardashian needs to be around. They need to keep it simple, so Lamar’s children can see him whenever they want to see him. They’re waiting in line to see their own father.\" \nOdom was found unresponsive in a Nevada brothel last week, where he had reportedly been taking a supplement marketed as an \"herbal Viagra.\" He reportedly also told one of the women who works at the brothel that he had used cocaine, but reports indicate that no one saw him use any drugs.
