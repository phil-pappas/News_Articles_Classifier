They no longer work for Wendy's.\"\nOnce the employees were let go, Wendy's apologized to the family. Osowski said she was waiting for a formal apology from the fast-food chain.\n\"I don't accept the apology because I am fully aware of what racism is in this country,\" she said.\nCopyright 2015 KDVR via CNN.
