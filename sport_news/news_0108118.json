Miyler caught three passes for just 19 yards in last week's 35-32 loss at Quincy but passed a record tied just last season. His 35 catches for the season passed the season total of 33 achieved by Chris Anderson in 2014 and Chris Kleine in 1985. \"It felt good,\" said Miyler, of the record. \"I didn't know about it until a couple of people told me about it.\" When he wasn't running roughshod over Quincy from the fullback spot last week, he was terrorizing them from his safety spot on defense or returning kicks and punts like he does every game. \"I get tired a lot,\" said Miyler, who rarely comes off the field. \"Sometimes I ask to get taken out on special teams.\" While Miyler obviously leads the Streaks in receiving - his 523 receiving yards are close to the GHS season record of 607 set by Kleine in 1985 - he has also rushed for 644 yards on 93 carries and is one of the team's leading tacklers. His 16 touchdowns also lead the team. Asked if there's a better player in the Western Big 6 Conference, GHS coach Tim Dougherty says, \"I can't think of any offhand. I think in all-around play, he merits that. \"He excells in all phases. He might have the school record in catches but he also blocks for DeAndre (Moren). \"He's so versatile.\" With 92 yards rushing against Quincy, Moren reached 1,015 yards for the season. An All-WB6 selection last year, Miyler said he likes to play defense best. The 5-11, 195-pounder has been contacted by colleges but is far from making a decision yet. \"I'll play any place that wants to let me play,\" he said. Facing a Canton, Mich., team on Saturday in a must-win game for a playoff spot, Dougherty hopes there's some games left in Miyler's high school career. \"We took our wide receiver and put him at fullback in our offense and he made it look easy,\" said Dougherty. \"It's not easy. \"On defense, he's always around the ball. He's a special player. \"He's right up there with guys like Ben Holloway who I've had who played at that high level.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:40:30.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
