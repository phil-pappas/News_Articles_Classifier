The allegations have not been proven and a COC spokesman says that probe will continue.\nSince then, more complaints against Aubut have surfaced in the media from two other women, including one who worked closely with him at a Montreal law firm.\nThe COC statement says the organization is very concerned by the allegations that have been made and that it is committed to taking any necessary actions following Rolland's findings or any other findings\nIn a statement Wednesday night after the initial complaint, Aubut described the allegations as a \"remark he allegedly made to a colleague\" and that he'd offered his \"unconditional support\" to those investigating the matter. He has not had any further public comment.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos 'I woke up on park benches some mornings': New revelations in Rob Ford's past drug use\n0\nLeafs' Babcock returns to Joe Louis Arena\n0\nOregon gunman had cache of 13 weapons: Federal agent\n0\nHeroic army vet shot 7 times trying to stop Oregon gunman\n0\nCops Taser man inside Oshawa Tim Hortons\n0\nGovernment, cops raid raw-milk crusader's farm\n0\nHurricane Joaquin batters the Bahamas, expected to miss Atlantic Canada\n0\nSanta Claus running for mayor of North Pole\n0\nMarco Muzzo appears in bail court\n0\nTroy Tulowitzki listed in Blue Jays' lineup against Rays\n0\nZabi Akbari - Witness To Kirby Rd Fatal Crash\nVaughan crash eyewitness\nPlenty Of Work Left For Leafs\nPat Kane Video\nRaptors media day\nMore from Other Sports Over the Line?! - Overzealous Blue Jays, Don Cherry's choke take, gun toting soccer ref, and more 0\nCanada falls to France at Rugby World Cup 0\nFresh allegations surface against COC head Marcel Aubut 0\nWindies coach hits land mine 0\nAubut steps down as COC president after sexual harassment allegation 0\nInside Toronto sun.com News\nGovernment, cops raid raw-milk crusader's farm 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-03T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:59:13.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
