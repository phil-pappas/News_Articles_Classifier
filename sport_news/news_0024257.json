But there's still no trophy.\" \nThe Cardinal (5-1, 4-0), however, is steaming closer to having the chance to play for one -- and maybe two. \nStanford's eighth consecutive victory over UCLA featured another efficient performance by Hogan, more dominance from the offensive line, a dazzling catch by receiver Francis Owusu and an opportunistic defense: Cornerback Alijah Holder's pick six in the first quarter gave Stanford a lead it would not relinquish. Advertisement \nOh, and there was plenty of McCaffrey, too. The sophomore returned a kickoff 96 yards, uncorked a 70-yard touchdown run and averaged 13.1 yards every time he touched the ball. \nWith a home-heavy schedule down the stretch, the sizzling Cardinal (5-1, 4-0) is seemingly well positioned to not only win the Pac-12 North but contend for a berth in the four-team playoff. \n\"We put up 56 points against a good defense and that's something -- definitely we'll celebrate our victories,\" McCaffrey said. \"But at the same time, I still think we haven't played our best football.\" \nMasterful as he was, McCaffrey didn't produce the play of the game. \nThat came courtesy of Owusu on a 41-yard flea-flicker from Hogan. The underthrown pass was about to hit UCLA safety Jaleel Wadood in the back as they collided chest-to-chest. But Owusu reached around Wadood's back with both hands, as if giving him a hug, and snared the ball as the tumbled to the grass. \n\"I was squeezing for my life,\" Owusu said. \nIt was the best catch by a Stanford receiver since Kodi Whitfield's one-handed touchdown snare against UCLA two years ago. \n\"I can't describe that catch,\" coach David Shaw said of Owusu's touchdown. \"I don't understand what happened, to be honest. I was looking at my call sheet for the next call because I thought it was incomplete.\" \nStanford has scored more than 50 points in back-to-back games for the first time since 2011. \nHogan in his last four games: Nine touchdowns, two interceptions and a 73.2 completion percentage. \nFor most of that span, he has played with a sprained left ankle. \n\"I feel like I have a good thing going with the training staff, and they're getting me out there and getting me healthy,\" he said. \"So, hopefully, one of these days I'll be back at 100 percent.\" \nThe Cardinal has averaged 34.6 points during its eight-game winning streak against UCLA. \nKickoff time for the Oct. 31 game at Washington State is expected to be announced Monday.
