It's a combination of missing practice and not quite being there (physically). He's close, but it's a combination of those two things,” Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said. “We decided that was the best way to go this week.” \nMariota stayed in the game after suffering the MCL injury last Sunday on a low hit by the Dolphins' Olivier Vernon, but was evaluated on Monday and did not take any practice reps. That has the Titans turning to Mettenberger, who made six starts a year ago as a rookie, completing 107 of 197 passes for 1,412 yards with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions. \nALSO READ: DGB Ready to Take on Bigger Role \nMettenberger said he is less focused on himself being back in the lineup and more focused on trying to help the Titans end their four-game losing streak. \n“The important thing is we go out there and try to get a team win. That's ultimately my job. It doesn't matter who's out there at quarterback, everyone is expecting us to win a ballgame, and that's what I've been working toward,” Mettenberger said. \nElsewhere on the injury front, the Titans will be without cornerback Perrish Cox, who is out with a hamstring injury and receiver Harry Douglas, who has a rib cartilage injury. In Douglas' case, the Titans may need to add a receiver, perhaps Rico Richardson, to the 53-man roster as they are down to just three healthy wideouts. \nWhisenhunt added that safety Michael Griffin, who was limited Friday with his sprained LCL in his left knee, would be a game-time decision. \nVernon was fined a total of $37,363 by the NFL, according to reports for his two hits on Mariota, the low hit that injured his knee and a blow to the head later in the game. \nDOWNLOAD OUR APPS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:31:17.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
