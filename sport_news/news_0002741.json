Entering Friday’s game, Bayfield (6-0, 3-0 2A Western Slope South) sported a No. 2 ranking by the Colorado High School Activities Association, and the Wolverines showed how powerful they are. Bayfield blitzed and hammered Montezuma-Cortez (2-5, 1-2) all night, which constantly gave the Wolverines’ offense great field position. “We were in the right position to make tackles,” Bayfield head coach Gary Heide said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “They had a hard time going against our defense with the way it was designed. It was a good job.” Senior Brody Mcghehy scored Bayfield’s first touchdown and would later score on a 60-yard punt return. Senior Zane Phelps added two touchdowns of his own on offense and a fumble recovery on defense, while sophomore defensive end Ryan Phelps also got in the action with an interception in the first quarter. “(Mcghehy) had some big plays,” Heide said. “He’s a spectacular runner, an all-purpose back, he can receive and now apparently he’s good on special teams. He’s always a threat to break a big one.” After Mcghehy’s initial touchdown, and no less than a minute later, Bayfield blocked a Montezuma-Cortez punt that was recovered by the kicking team in the end zone for a safety. Before the Panthers could blink, Bayfield was up 10-0. Then senior Kelton McCoy added a 14-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak, and Bayfield’s next two possessions ended with a pair of Zane Phelps touchdowns. “(Zane Phelps) was our workhorse,” Heide said. “I think everyone (on Montezuma-Cortez) had a shot at him, but he’s just a workhorse and everything thrives off him.” Zane Phelps not only did it on offense, but did it on defense as well. On one play, Phelps blitzed the Panthers and broke through the offensive line and got to the Panthers’ quarterback the same time the handoff took place. Phelps then grabbed the ball mid-handoff and stole it for another turnover. Sophomore Hunter Killough capped the night off for Bayfield by scoring on a 17-yard touchdown run. At that point, the mercy rule was in effect with a running clock with Bayfield up 43-0. Heide said his Wolverine team didn’t let up on the Panthers because this was a game the Wolverines had to win decisively if they’re to make a run at a league championship. “We can’t let down against any team,” Heide said. After spending the past two weeks on the road, Bayfield will return home next week against league foe Alamosa (3-4, 3-0) at 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 23 at Wolverine Country Stadium for senior night. “(Alamosa) is playing really well. They have a lot to gain, this is going to be an emotional and high strung game, we really have to be ready for Alamosa,” Heide said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:55:52.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
