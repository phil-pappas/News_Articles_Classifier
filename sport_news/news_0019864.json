They’re sound. They’re smart. They’ll be the best-conditioned team we’ll play and maybe the best coached team. Hopefully, we’re mature enough to understand how good this team is that we’re about to play.“Lindsey Wilson doesn’t mean anything right now.”One of the reasons Cronic said Cumberland’s record is misleading is its strength of schedule. The Bulldogs lost to pair of NCAA Division II schools in Valdosta State and West Alabama to open the season, but they have been hot since, beating Pikeville and Kentucky Christian over the last two weeks.Offensively, Cumberland has a dynamic offense — coordinated by former Cherokee High School quarterback Klay Koester — that runs through mobile quarterback Justin Snyder and running back Austin Chaplin, similar to the scheme that gave Reinhardt trouble last month in a 36-25 win against Georgetown College.Cronic said containing Snyder will be key, but it will be just as important for the Reinhardt defense to get off to a fast start.“We really need to get off to a faster start defensively than we did last week,” Cronic said. “Faulkner came out and ran it right at us early, and we weren’t ready for it. We better be ready this week, because Cumberland will do the same thing.”Starting fast has not been a strength for Reinhardt this season. The Eagles have trailed early in four of their six games, but they persevered and even prospered in those situations, winning those games by an average of 23.8 points.“Having 27 kids that have been with us for four years is huge,” Cronic said. “They already have it filed away in their minds that we’re never out of it. We could get down again this week, but we’ll know we just have to keep playing. We don’t talk about the scoreboard very much. We talk about us working and being the best we can be. I think the kids are buying what we’re selling, and I’m proud of them for being that way.”Leading the comeback last week against Faulkner was quarterback Ryan Thompson, who was named the NAIA offensive player of the week after going 20-of-31 for 347 yards and two touchdowns. Reinhardt also ranks second in the nation in total offense, averaging 572.7 yards per game. Most of that yardage has come on the ground behind the trio of L.J. Stegall, Niagel Curtis and Sam Jones, and that attack becomes even more dangerous when Thompson is throwing well.“We try to do what we think is going to work the best, and those are some things that worked out well against Faulkner,” Cronic said. “We have a lot of confidence in Ryan, but we’re going to be who we are. I’ve always said, if we’re executing well in our passing game, it makes us difficult to defend. We’re going to need him to do that again.”Also playing a major role in Reinhart’s success has been Cronic’s willingness to go for it on fourth down, and the Eagles’ ability to convert. They were 3-for-3 on fourth-down conversions last week, which Cronic credits his players for.“I think you have to take calculated risks and be aware of what’s going on,” he said. “Down in (Faulkner’s) territory, we had a few things I felt. I have faith in the kids, and I’m pretty aggressive, but I also have to make good decisions. Luckily, the kids made me look like I knew what I was doing last Saturday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:20:50.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
