Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: Do you think Kevin Sumlin is a little perturbed by Kingsbury, in his little feud with Hogs coach, saying A&M would probably kick Arkansas' butt?\nKate Hairopoulos: Nah. I don't think that really adds any extra motivation, or whatever. And Sumlin has known Bielema for a really long time, as both have Big Ten ties. And Sumlin talked with Kingsbury since then, gleaning a little advice from his former offensive coordinator at Houston and A&M. Fun little feud, though, eh?\nQuestion: Haven't seen either of Arkansas' last two games. What's been the Hogs' problem?\nKate Hairopoulos: They've suffered a lot of injuries, including several receivers. Their defense simply isn't the same unit that shut out LSU and Ole Miss last year, losing guys like Trey Flowers. They gave up almost 500 yards to Texas Tech, including 171 on the ground. QB Brandon Allen missed a key play in the red zone. So...a lot. Arkansas will have the advantage of practicing and preparing for similar offenses for two straight weeks, as Tech and A&M share a lot of similarities.\nQuestion: LSU is looking beastly right now. I know Kyle Allen, barring injury, has entrenched himself as the No. 1 but I think A&M will need an x-factor like Murray's speed and quickness when facing the Tigers.\nKate Hairopoulos: Perhaps. Murray is faster than Johnny Manziel, but LSU always had the speed and scheme to bottle Manziel up. He definitely provides a great change of pace since defenses won't want to defend him the same way they'll prepare for Allen. Speaking of beastly, my goodness, Leonard Fournette.\nQuestion: What are the key matchups for A&M-Arkansas?\nKate Hairopoulos: Arkansas' defense has just one sack in three games. Hard to imagine it slowing down A&M and Kyle Allen if he can distribute the ball as he chooses.\nQuestion: What's your prediction for Saturday's game?\nKate Hairopoulos: Arkansas will be playing, really, for a fresh start and to save its season. A&M is playing to prove it can continue its momentum in league play. Don't think the Hogs can slow A&M down enough on offense, so 38-24, A&M.\nQuestion: If A&M's defensive improvement continues, do you think Kyle Field can go back to being a great home-field edge for the Aggies?\nKate Hairopoulos: Sure, I guess that's what the Wrecking Crew was known for. After going 0-3 in league play at home last season, A&M is eager to get that back. It has really been better on the road under Sumlin. SEC home games this year: Mississippi State, Alabama, South Carolina and Auburn.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-24T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:52:35.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
