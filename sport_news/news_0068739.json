How great is this.' It's perfect.\"\nWalton, who at 6-foot-11 is believed to be the world's tallest Deadhead, describes himself as a \"joyrider.\"\nHe said he's been involved with the Amgen Tour for years, sometimes riding for just a few days.\nLast year he rode the whole tour, completing as much of each leg as possible before dark. He plans to do the same thing this year, riding with the Chris Carmichael Team.\n\"I ride all day,\" Walton said. \"I ride every stage, as much as I can. Some I don't finish in time. This is a very difficult, very challenging professional course.\"\nThe Amgen Tour has twice entered northern San Diego County. This will be the first time it'll hit the heart of the city, with the leg starting and finishing near the water.\nThe race, which attracts world champions, Olympic medalists and top Tour de France competitors and other elite cyclists, will go south to north for just the second time since it began in 2006.\nThe rest of the race is:\nStage 2, May 16, South Pasadena to Santa Clarita.\nStage 3, May 17, Thousand Oaks to Santa Barbara County.\nStage 4, May 18, Morro Bay to Monterey County.\nStage 5, May 19, Lodi to South Lake Tahoe.\nStage 6, May 20, Folsom Individual Time Trial and Women's Team Time Trial.\nStage 7, May 21, Santa Rosa.\nStage 8, May 22, Sacramento.\n\"Everything that I love is encompassed in the world of cycling — technology, science, engineering, teamwork, discipline, sacrifice, training, repetition, fitness, health, nutrition,\" Walton said. \"What my bike really means to me is freedom and independence, because my bike allows me to do things and go places that I can't do and get to on my own. It is the ultimate tool. It is the greatest invention in the history of the world.\"\n___\nFollow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at http://twitter.com/berniewilson\n1 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
