We spend an inordinate amount of time on how to respond,” said coach Tom Herman, the former Ohio State offensive coordinator, after the No. 21 Cougars came back from a sluggish start to dominate winless Central Florida.\n“The human element is to freak out and try to do things you’re not supposed to do. ... Trying to do something outside of yourself never works. Going back to fundamentals with a driven purpose works.”\nKenneth Farrow ran for a career-high 167 yards and three touchdowns and, after falling behind late in the first half, Houston scored 24 points in a span of 3 1/2 minutes, winning for the fifth time by 21 points or more.\n“We were passive at first, but we came out strong after that,” safety Adrian McDonald said. “We handled the adversity of being behind well. We made some adjustments. We made some big plays and then finished them off.”\nHouston (7-0, 4-0 American Athletic Conference) won the second half 35-0 and handed UCF (0-8, 0-4) its most lopsided home loss.\nBrandon Wilson scored for the Cougars on an 85-yard return of a fumble just 74 seconds into the game, but that was Houston’s only score in the first 27 minutes.\nUCF, which entered the game ranked last offensively among 127 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision, went up 10-7 on Matthew Wright’s 48-yard field goal with 4:38 left in the half. At that point UCF had 216 yards to Houston’s 74.\nBut the Cougars responded with a six-play, 72-yard drive to regain the lead on Farrow’s 26-yard touchdown run with 2:27 left in the first half, and the rest of the game was all Houston.\nHouston finished with 600 total yards, including 366 on the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:24:22.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
