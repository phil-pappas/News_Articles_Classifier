We’re just glad we can keep it going one more week.” \n\nLyon completed four passes on the final drive, which started with 1:07 left at Central’s 43-yard line. \n\nOn first-and-goal and with the clock ticking, Lyon couldn’t find an open receiver and ran for the goal line instead. \n\n“It was a four-vertical play,” he said. “A window opened up, so I just tucked it and went. It was all instinct. Looking back at it, I guess it was risky because if I don’t make it, it’s over, but …” \n\nCentral coach John Magistro complimented Lyon. \n\n“Gavin’s pretty fast, and thank goodness he took advantage of that when he saw daylight,” he said. “I’ve been in a few of these, but I’ve never been prouder. We’re banged up, but we keep finding ways to win.” \n\nCentral (9-0, 6-0) did so despite three critical turnovers. Lyon’s first interception, on the third play of the game, was returned 30 yards for a touchdown by Willie Lewis. The second, by Braeden Hook with 1:59 remaining, seemed to doom the Warhawks’ chances. \n\nBut Darby, facing fourth-and-1 at the Central 43, called timeout and opted to go for it. \n\nQuarterback Nick Powers, who rushed for 176 yards on 28 carries and a touchdown, was stuffed for no gain. Darby (8-1, 5-1) had picked up the tough yards all night. \n\n“Was I surprised they went for it, after Michigan-Michigan State? Are you kidding me?” Magistro said. “They kept shifting and trying to get us to jump offsides, but our guys were disciplined enough not to do it. \n\n“Our defense deserves a lot of credit, too. They’ve really come on the past few weeks. And they were fantastic when it mattered tonight. That fourth-down play was something else.” \n\nDarby missed a field-goal attempt and also missed a golden chance at a touchdown when an open receiver was unable to get his feet down in the end zone. \n\nCentral overcame the turnovers and a sprained ankle that hobbled standout running back Benny Snell, who nonetheless finished with 117 yards on 23 carries with a touchdown. \n\n“It’s been a next-man-up approach for us all year,” said senior receiver Andrew Wallace, who made three catches on the final drive. “We’ve developed so much chemistry during the course of this run, it’s amazing.\nsblackledge@dispatch.com \n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:27:01.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
