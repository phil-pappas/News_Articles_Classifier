Meanwhile, Kendall Jenner stole the show at Balmain with actress Jada Pinkett Smith and singer Joe Jonas looking on.\nHere are the highlights of Thursday's ready-to-wear spring-summer shows:\nKENDALL JENNER\nKim Kardashian was the talk of Balmain last season sporting a new blond hairstyle — and for spring-summer it was her half-sister Jenner's turn to rock the crowds from the runway.\nModeling for two looks — a space-age '60s jumpsuit and a geometric lattice dress — Kendall had all eyes on her. Pinkett Smith, meanwhile, stunned with slick-back hair in a cinched waist olive green Balmain sweater and ultra mini.\nBALMAIN'S AGGRESSIVE FEMINITY\nBalmain's Olivier Rousteing showcased the sexual power of the strong, independent woman in his no-holds-barred styles at the Thursday afternoon show.\nUsing the colors of the pigments of ancient civilizations — malachite green, golden sienna, Egyptian blue, and white— as well as suedes and jewels, Balmain's 29-year-old showman channeled a warrior-like feel.\nStrapped, cinched waists and square belt buckles followed diagonal bands across the torso and huge metal neck-plates evoked a warrior princess. Slits and meshes, meanwhile, exposed sections of delicate skin. It was a nice contrast.\nThen there were the ruffles. Huge, billowing, tiered ruffles peppered the show like on one caramel column dress, or a black leather skirt. It put the clock to the '70s and shows that unapologetic Rousteing certainly doesn't do things by half.\nSINGER CAROLINE VREELAND PERFORMS AT SWAROVSKI BIRTHDAY\nRising music star Caroline Vreeland performed to cheers at the glitziest party of Paris Fashion Week so far: Swarovksi's 120th birthday.\nThe VIP-filled soiree on Wednesday night also celebrated the release of a new book \"Swarovski: Celebrating a History of Collaborations in Fashion, Jewelry, Performance and Design.\"\nThough blond beauty Vreeland — who's also a model — might not be a household name, she's already fashion royalty, being the great-granddaughter of powerful Harper's Bazaar editor Diana Vreeland, who reigned across the magazine world from 1936 to 1962.\nCHLOE'S SUMMER\nSummer was in the air at Clare Waight Keller's Thursday show at Paris' Grand Palais.\nThe British Chloe designer this season mixed up sportswear, hippy styles and lashings of color to produce a saleable collection, frothing with loose silk silhouettes.\nThere was more than a whiff of Seventies' flower power.\nThe 44-strong show opening with billowing hippy flares with small retro print — contrasted nicely with a jogging top that might be seen on a girl running around the Tuileries Gardens. Relaxed yet chic was its statement.\nLater, floppy bows at the neck, flared sleeves, billowing harem pants, and dangling tassels further evoked the boho era.\nBut this collection was all about color: the indigo, beige, pale yellow, vermilion red and burgundy — that all came to a climax in a cascading rainbow gown that would certainly not be for the color-shy.\nCARVEN'S SANITIZED CHIC\nA large PVC greenhouse with white tube lights had fashionistas curious ahead of Carven's spring-summer show, only the second so far for new designers Adrien Caillaudaud and Alexis Martial at the age-old Parisian house.\nPared-down and slightly sanitized was the style — carefully aligned with the decor. This infused the 41-piece collection with the tight, crisp silhouettes and mini-skirts of the Sixties.\nThus, delicately flared pants in dove gray mixed with colored silk shirts, and one white striped sporty-looking top with neat colored lines.\nThe best of the Sixties musing came with a cut-out disc motif on a burnt orange or white mini, and a crisp white mini dress that looked almost like a nurse's uniform — stylishly evoking the sanitized feel\nThe collection loosened up toward the end with some layered skirts and a frothy white dress with criss-cross fabric panels.\n___\nThomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP\nCopyright The Associated Press", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-01T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:30:12.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
