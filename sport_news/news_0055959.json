It was sponsored Monday by state Sen. Richard Codey (D-Essex) and co-sponsored by state Sen. Peter Barnes (D-Middlesex).\nLast week, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association expressed concern that it could not enforce the bill if passed. The proposed legislation calls for the NJSIAA to regulate the process.\n– Staff report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:34.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
