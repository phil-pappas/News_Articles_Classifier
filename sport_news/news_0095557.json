The reprieve was short-lived as Wahab produced a superb in-swinging yorker to bowl him seven runs later in the 104th over. \nWood gave the innings some welcome thrust, crunching 14 runs off four balls off Wahab, and Rashid received a life on 42 when Hafeez couldn't cling onto a tough chance in the gully off Yasir. \nRashid posted his fifty off 110 balls with a scampered single to mid-on - Wood perilously close to being run out - and the pair's fifty stand came up off 165 deliveries. \nJust when Pakistan's hopes appeared to be rapidly declining with 11.1 overs left, Wood snicked Zulfiqar to Mohammad Hafeez at slip and Rashid's heroics weren't quite enough, his downfall sparking jubilant Pakistan celebrations.
