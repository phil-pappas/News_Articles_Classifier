For the board, Manmohan Singh is still the Prime Minister is still and P Chidambaram the Finance Minister. The goof-up in the answer key came to light when a teacher was checking the answer-sheets of Class-12 students, who appeared for the semester examinations held last month. The question number 25 asked students of public administration to write down the names of current Prime Minister and Finance Minister. The question carried two marks. The teacher, requesting anonymity, told The Tribune he was shocked to see the answer key made available by the HBSE mentioned Manmohan Singh and P Chidambaram as the Prime Minister and Finance Minister, respectively. “I was in a fix whether or not to awards marks to students who had written Narendra Modi and Arun Jaitely,” he said. He added unless the board issued supplementary instructions to teachers, they were helpless to deduct marks of students who had written Modi and Jaitely. After The Tribune brought the matter to the notice of the HBSE, its spokesperson Minakshi Sharda said the answer key would be corrected and dispatched to examiners so that they could award marks on the basis of the new answer key. She said examiners were given guidelines to use their intelligence if they found answer keys doubtful. Sources said lethargic attitude of HBSE’s senior officials in conducting the examinations was to blamed for the goof-up. A source said the question paper in controversy was set more than one-and-a-half years ago, when the UPA-II government was in power and the board had supplied the same set in the semester examinations without updating it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:13:40.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
