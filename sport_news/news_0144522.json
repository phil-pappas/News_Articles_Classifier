Butler’s emergence was validated by the NBA ’s Most Improved Player Award, and he’s now feeling every bit the star, with all that entails.\nThe Bulls certainly view Butler as a superstar and one of their leaders, signing him to a five-year, $90 million contract this past summer. Rose certainly has the talent to play at an elite, superstar level, but injuries have prevented him from getting there since the 2011-12 season.\nRose has had his share of bad luck, including this year when he was struck in the face during practice by a teammate's elbow and suffered a left orbital fracture.\nButler wants to be the face of the franchise, and he has elevated his game to warrant that role.\nAs long as both players are on the same page in trying to bring an NBA championship back to Chicago, this should be long forgotten if that goal is realized.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://bleacherreport.com/cleveland-cavaliers", "http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/1018875/according-source-jimmy-butler-hasnt-thrilled-derrick-roses-work-ethic", "http://bleacherreport.com/nba", "http://bleacherreport.com/kevin-garnett", "http://bleacherreport.com/", "http://bleacherreport.com/chicago-bulls", "http://bleacherreport.com/jimmy-butler", "http://espn.go.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/13181943/jimmy-butler-chicago-bulls-agree-five-year-90-million-deal?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/05/18/bernstein-derrick-rosejimmy-butler-tension-marred-game-6/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/derrick-rose-injury-update-0"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:40:02.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
