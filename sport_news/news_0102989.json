NEW YORK — These days, Wilmer Flores' tears are generated by the sting of champagne from another joyous postseason clubhouse celebration.\n\"It's amazing to be here,\" Flores said as the Mets prepared for the World Series. \"It's a great feeling.\"\nFlores' feelings were entirely different on the night of July 29, when news leaked of his impending trade — along with pitcher Zack Wheeler — to the Milwaukee Brewers — for outfielder Carlos Gomez.\nStanding at shortstop late in the game against San Diego, Flores looked like the loneliest man at Citi Field. He began to cry.\nOnly after the game would Flores learn that the trade was called off because of the Mets' medical concerns about Gomez's hip. Gomez instead was shipped to Houston.\nAnd from that moment on, the Mets' season turned toward October.\nPivoting out of the Flores-Gomez collapse, general manager Sandy Alderson swung the key trade for slugger Yoenis Cespedes, while Flores became the Mets' homegrown symbol of fidelity. He never wanted to leave the organization that signed him as a 16-year-old infielder from Venezuela eight years ago.\n\"It just shows me that everything happens for a reason,\" said Flores, elevated from a part-time role to starting shortstop after Ruben Tejada's injury in the NL Division Series.\nTwo days after the deal fell through, Flores clubbed a game-winning home run — further endearing him to a fan base that offered standing ovations after his emotional moment.\n\"Even before the trade deadline, we were struggling a little bit but we still had a pretty good team,\" Flores said after Friday's optional team workout at Citi Field. \"The pitchers were giving us a chance to win every night.\n\"We [knew] we needed to score [more] runs and the front office brought some guys in that helped us,\" Flores said of the moves for Cespedes, Juan Uribe and Kelly Johnson. \"David [Wright] got healthy, we got [Travis] d'Arnaud back and we just put it together.\"\nBut Flores came close to being sacrificed for an offensive upgrade.\nAs that July 29 game played on, Flores picked up the fans' vibe. Social media was abuzz about a Brewers-Mets deal in place and the crowd gave Flores a rousing cheer his last time at bat.\n\"It's a little odd that Wilmer's still in the game,\" broadcaster Gary Cohen said at the time, calling the game on SNY. \"But the fans are giving him a nice sendoff here.\"\nSNY's camera caught Flores wiping away tears while at shortstop. He was finally pulled for a pinch-hitter in the ninth and was followed to the clubhouse by Wright, the team captain.\n\"When I came in, they told me there was no trade,\" Flores told reporters afterward. \"I was sad, being a Met forever … that's why I got emotional.\"\nEmotions ran high again during Game 2 of the division series, when a late slide by the Dodgers' Chase Utley fractured Tejada's right leg. But another Mets rallying point was born as Flores was pressed to fill the void.\n\"This is what you work for,\" said Flores, who is batting .292 (7-for-24) in eight playoff games with two doubles and a triple. \"First of all, you want to get to the big leagues. Once you're here, you want to make it to the World Series.\"\nIn another twist, Flores' backup is shortstop Matt Reynolds — a rookie who has yet to play in a big league game.\n\"If I get to make my debut in the World Series, that's great,\" said Reynolds, who wasn't even part of the Mets' September call-ups. \"If not, I'm still here and part of the team.\"\nSo, is Flores, ready to experience his first Fall Classic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:00:46.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
