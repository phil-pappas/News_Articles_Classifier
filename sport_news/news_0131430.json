The Tigers turned the ball over 30 times.\n-- Defense, rebounding and physicality are Pearl's biggest points of emphasis right now.\nBruce Pearl discusses Auburn's first basketball practice of 2015-16 season Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl speaks with the media after his team's first practice of the 2015-16 season. (Wesley Sinor/wsinor@al.com)\n-- Tyler Harris, a graduate transfer, was \"not known as the most physical player at Providence. Tyler Harris was not their best rebounder. Tyler Harris was not their best inside player, scoring with his back to the basket. He is some of those things for us.\" Pearl says Harris has gotten stronger and quicker, but shouldn't be \"all of those things for us.\"\n-- Horace Spencer can be a physical player, but \"bounces around\" because he's a freshman.\n-- \"I'm very pleased with our ability to shoot the basketball.\" Credits Kareem Canty, New Williams, Tahj Shamsid-Deen, Bryce Brown and T.J. Lang. Says T.J. Dunans is more of a slasher, and the Tigers are working on his long-range jumper. Jordon Granger is working on his long-range jump shot.\n-- \"Believe it or not, Cinmeon Bowers will take a 3 or two this year... I hope he takes it at the right time.\"\n-- \"Bowers has worked hard on his free throw stroke and jump shot.... At times when he turns it over, it's awful. It looks so bad.\" Wants Bowers to make better decisions.\n-- Junior guard Tahj Shamsid-Deen \"looks great\" following his should surgeries. Pearl says he's the best defensive guard on the team. \"He is in the right place at the right time, every time.\"\n-- Pearl expects to see more zone and full-court pressure with the new 30-second shot clock. \"It's going to be more about the system and style of play.\"\n-- Tigers will go through double sessions this week. He will give the players three days off, the last break they'll have until Christmas. Wants to work on court pressure defense and zone.\n-- Pearl says Canty has been \"one of the most consistent performers\" on the court, in the classroom and with his attitude. \"You can take him out of Harlem, but you can't take Harlem out of him.\"\n-- Pearl says \"don't be surprised\" is Canty and Shamsid-Deen are on the court at the same time. They will interchange between point guard and shooting guard.\n-- Pearl's looking forward to \"Pearl Jam\" pep rally next week. \"We're going to hang around all night to sign (autographs) and interact with our fan base.\"\n-- Pearl says the \"realistic\" goal is to finish in the upper half of the SEC and make a postseason push. \"That would be a great step for this program.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.auburntigers.com/collegesportslive/index.html?media=502039", "http://www.auburntigers.com/multimedia/aub-10-radio.html#tiger_talk"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:21:54.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
