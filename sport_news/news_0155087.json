You have to work at it, though. \n\"It’s not just about putting an academy building there, it’s about producing players and making sure they come through, we have to work at it continuously.” \nWolves academy boss Gareth Prosser today offers a rare insight into the inner workings of the club’s Compton Park, which has increased in size enormously in terms of both staff and players in recent years.
