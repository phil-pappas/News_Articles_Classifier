I think Jimmy's been, before that, his dad, Bob, have been partners of our families for 22 years. You go through good times, bad times, but at the end of the day, it's a partnership.\"\nAs far as the possibility for the Patriots losing a home game to an international contest, Kraft said that's a possibility.\n\"Fortunately for the league, there have been enough teams that have been willing to give up a home game,\" he said, \"but the league has the right to take one home game from each team in the league, I want to say over the next 15 years, but I could be wrong on the time frame, and ask you to host the game overseas. We would prefer not to do it, but hopefully it doesn't come down to that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:39:51.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
