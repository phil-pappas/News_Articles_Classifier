However, anglers usually call them speckled trout or, abbreviating the nickname further, \"specks.\" \nI don't know that the abbreviated appellation is a fond one because no other saltwater fish inspires so many casts with so many different lures as a speckled trout. It is probably more of an adversarial nickname, like that of a respected enemy. I think of them as the largemouth bass of the coast. \nAnglers use soft plastic lures, jigs, hard plastic lures, topwater lures and lipless crankbaits to catch them. In fact, just about any lure that will catch a bass will also entice a speck to bite - except when they just don't want to. They are the original you-should-have-been-here-yesterday fish because of the maddening way they have of biting with abandon one day, or one hour, before then simply developing a case of lockjaw or leaving the area. \nWhen it comes to colors, it is the same as with lure selection. If your trout jig-n-grub tackle box does not look like the biggest 120-count box of Crayola crayons, you should head back to the tackle shop and buy a few more bags of lead-heads and softies to toss to the trout. You never know which color will work on any day, and often simply switching colors will turn a bite back on that had tapered off to nothing. \nMy search for the perfect trout lure has proven just how persnickety specks can be. \nI have transitioned from casting jigs with soft plastic grub bodies to using scented grubs, enzyme-impregnated grubs, grubs that are shaped to look like shrimp and then to fishing those grubs beneath popping floats. The idea is to twitch the line so the float pops and sounds like the flipping of a shrimp, which attracts the attention of the fish to the lure. \nI had to haul my 20-foot Jones Brothers Bateau out of the marina ahead of Hurricane Joaquin, and it was also time for its fall tune-up. Unloading the boat storage box for the trip down the road to the service department, I discovered four forgotten tackle bags full of speck paraphernalia, including a leaked jar of Berkley Gulp! Enzyme-impregnated lures that stunk up the inside of the box. I also found lures that are my latest favorites, some Rapala Minnows and Zara Spooks. \nThese hard lures were originally made for bass fishing but that have made the transition to saltwater, with the Spook more specifically adapted. \nThe Spook is a walk-the-dog lure. Working the lure with twitches of the rod tip during the retrieve makes it flip-flop, imitating an injured shad or mullet. A trout will strike it, but misses the hooks on about four out of five attempts making it one of the most frustrating lures for catching them. However, for excitement, nothing beats the explosion of a topwater strike. \nThe trick is to keep the lure working, never stopping it until you feel the weight of the fish on the line before setting the hook. Set the hook prematurely and the lure flies out of the water, the fish loses interest and you are back to square one of those 10,000 casts. \nRecently, I have been using a Rapala Clackin' Minnow, a freshwater lure that has not undergone the metamorphosis to saltwater with the beefier fittings and stainless steel hooks of the Spook. It also costs much more, at about $18 per lure, which is a lot of money to plunk down for a lure that a sharp-toothed bluefish may steal with a single bite. \nI bought dozens of the offset Flash Feather trailer trebles for refitting the Rapalas. Instead of discarding the lures when the special hooks get dull or rusted, I change the hooks to save a few bucks. Such are the lengths a speckled trout fisherman will go to just to catch a few fish for dinner. \nAs I looked at all of the unused, but purchased, lures removed from the boat, I wondered whether it was time to have an abandoned lure yard sale or simply donate them to some underprivileged angler just beginning his quest for the perfect speck lure. \nYou never know, though, because any of them will catch a speck given the right day, the right tide, the right water temperature and the fish being in a cooperative mood. \nI think I'll save them all for a rainy day, just in case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:52:08.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
