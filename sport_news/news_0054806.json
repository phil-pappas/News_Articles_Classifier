But this hunk here doesn’t put it to use. The result is he says whatever comes to his mind, putting him in the category of blatantly honest people. Give it up for television’s popular and mischievous face, Gautam Gulati. The winner of reality show Bigg Boss season 8 is currently hosting another reality show on MTV Big F, something that he is enjoying. But there is still a list of things that he would want to execute with all honesty. Topping the charts is his desire to act in films. Here it from this Delhite. “As of now, I am only hosting TV shows or award functions or doing some dance shows, but I am not doing TV serials anymore. I don’t think I want to do it now,” Gautam says it with natural candidness. Even though the actor shot to fame after he won Bigg Boss 8, TV doesn’t figure in the scheme of things. “I want to concentrate on acting in films. I am reading scripts, meeting people, I wish to come as a solo hero and this is where my entire focus is.” The talk inevitably does back to the mud slinging, tough days of Bigg Boss. “For audiences it is pure entertainment, but for an inmate staying in the house is the toughest thing. Trust me it isn’t easy. This is where you can break because the fellow contestants most of the times say things to provoke you,” Guatam shares he survived best because he didn’t pretend. In a way not having a filter on his thoughts helped! “Even today I get messages that I have raised the bar for the Bigg Boss contestants. I have been completely honest on the show. I didn’t interfere in anyone’s personal space which I don’t do in life as well,” he says. After the stint with the reality show, Gautam has also raised the bar for himself. He would now test the Bollywood waters. With Salman Khan’s grace? He laughs, “Salman bhai ka toh aashirwad kaafi hai. He is a great human being.” Gautam who still gets numerous offers for reality shows, ends up saying no to them. “I was approached to host Roadies as well, but as I said I have other plans for myself. A movie, a solo film this is what is on my mind. I believe if I think positively for something, and work towards it as well, there is no way I can’t achieve it. I had never thought that I would be mingling with stars like Sylvester Stallone at Cannes red carpet. I did it, so, never lose patience, just work towards the goal.” jasmine@tribunemail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:07:59.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
