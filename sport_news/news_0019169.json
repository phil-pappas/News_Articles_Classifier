Punching up traditional dishes with modern, fresh touches.\nAN ISRAELI restaurant in New Orleans? “I knew it was a risk,” said Alon Shaya of his namesake place on Magazine Street. “The key to introducing people to new cuisines is to make it really familiar and comforting.”\nIt’s hard to imagine a safer bet than this recipe, Mr. Shaya’s third Slow Food Fast lemony pan-fried chicken, buttery couscous, sautéed zucchini and fresh mint. Mr. Shaya emphasized that it’s essential to spend time crisping the chicken’s skin so it really crackles. A scattering of lemon zest helps cut through the meat’s richness.\nSince Shaya opened earlier this year, New Orleanians have been queuing out the door. The appeal, Mr. Shaya insisted, derives from the deep roots of this cuisine: “It’s food people have been cooking in homes for years and years.”\nLemon Chicken With Couscous and Zucchini Total Time: 35 minutes Serves: 4\n1 (approximately 3-pound) chicken, broken into parts Salt ½ cup olive oil 2 lemons 1¾ cups water 1 (7-ounce) box couscous 1 tablespoon butter 8 garlic cloves 2 medium zucchinis cut into ½-inch cubes 2½ tablespoons mint leaves, roughly chopped 1.
