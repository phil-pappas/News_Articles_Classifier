With that, now we have Oman LNG taking a keen interest in shaping Omani golf. With their support we want to create an environment that allows beginners in the development squad aspire to reach the top.” \nThe OGC's development squad currently features 18 promising players in the age-group of 7-16 years. The players are pooled into three groups based on their skill levels - novice, intermediate and advanced. They regularly undergo training at Ghala Golf Club under PGA Pro coach Milo Breitenwisher. \nHarib al Kitani, the chief executive officer of Oman LNG, expressed happiness in extending his relationship with the OGC. He said, “We are more than happy to take up this responsibility. This development squad is growing very steadily and we want it to flourish.” Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:26:17.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
