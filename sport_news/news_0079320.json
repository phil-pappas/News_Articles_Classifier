The Los Angeles Dodgers announced today they’re mutually parting ways with manager Don Mattingly. Mattingly, who’s been with the Dodgers since 2011, posted a 446-363 regular season record, but his team’s playoff struggles related to having the highest payroll in baseball made Los Angeles uncomfortable with the relationship going forward. With his regular season success, other MLB clubs will certainly come knocking on Mattingly’s door. Here are the three most likely landing spots for him, with one clear leader.\nAdChoices Miami Marlins\nThe Marlins have been courting Mattingly for a while now, and Jon Heyman reports owner Jeffrey Loria has a relationship with him and is “intrigued by the possibility.”\nThe Marlins had a disastrous 2015 season. Mike Redmond was fired early in the season, and replaced by general manager Dan Jennings, who posted a paltry .443 (55-69) winning percentage. Mattingly might have trepidation going to Miami, solely because they’ve had six different managers since 2010, and managing under Loria is unpredictable to say the least. He’s known for pulling the rug from under you.\nIf the Marlins could guarantee some stability, they actually have a promising young core which could make the destination appealing. Giancarlo Stanton is the premier power hitter in baseball and is only 25-years-old. Jose Fernandez, who missed most of 2015 with Tommy John surgery, was electric upon his return and should be fully healthy in 2016. Former Dodgers shortstop Dee Gordon led MLB in hits and won the NL batting title. Christian Yelich is only going to get better. There are solid pieces for Mattingly in Miami. The big question is if he wants all the baggage that comes with coaching in Miami.\nWashington Nationals\nThe Nationals had a shocking 2015 season. As heavy favorites entering the year, Matt Williams’ incompetency and the self-destructing acquisition of Jonathan Papelbon nuked the club’s momentum as they missed the playoffs entirely. Honestly, anybody would represent an upgrade behind the bench over Williams. According to sportswriter Danny Knobler : \"Where next for Mattingly? Miami seems most likely, but Nationals would be an interesting fit.\"\nThe Nationals are looking for somebody who can right the ship, and with Mattingly’s regular season track record, he could be their man. He would inherit a talented roster and get to manage Bryce Harper, who put up video game numbers this season, in his prime. Mattingly, who had an expensive and deep rotation in L.A. would have Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Gio Gonzalez, Joe Ross, and Tanner Roark at this disposable in DC (plus anyone the club may sign in the offseason). There’s no gaping hole which can’t be immediately addressed on the roster. It would be an excellent situation for him to return to immediate success.\nInterestingly enough, Tim Wallach, Mattingly’s bench coach who was also fired by the Dodgers, has interviewed for the managerial position in DC. Either way, he’s an excellent fit for a club who wants to quickly forget this season.\nSeattle Mariners\nSeattle was mediocre once again in 2015 posting a 76-86 record. They cleaned house, replacing longtime general manager Jack Zduriencik with Jerry Dipoto, who subsequently fired manager Lloyd McClendon in favor of hiring his own manager.\nThe Mariners reportedly offered their managerial opening to Jason Varitek, but the former Boston Red Sox catcher turned them down.\nSeattle might not be as intriguing of an option as the two teams listed above, but they’re a reasonable candidate for Mattingly’s services. As the former hitting coach with the New York Yankees, he’s got a relationship with second baseman Robinson Cano, who he coached between 2005 and 2007.\nOutside of Cano, third baseman Kyle Seager, and outfielder Nelson Cruz, the roster needs a lot of work. But the rotation in Seattle is tantalizing. They have ace Felix Hernandez at the top with emerging youngsters Taijuan Walker and James Paxton ready to take the next step. The team has also shown every sign they’re going to spend the money to re-sign Hisashi Iwakuma. Throw in another top-flight starter like David Price, Zack Grienke, Johnny Cueto, or even a bounce-back candidate like Jeff Samardzija or Doug Fister, and their starting five would be unfairly stacked.\nDipoto would have to do some convincing to Mattingly that he can turn the roster into something more than it currently is, but the Mariners have the pieces to make it a feasible destination.\nMattingly will have a ton of options and shouldn’t be out of work in 2016 – unless he wants to take the year off.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/boston-red-sox-seattle-mariners-jason-varitek-manager-offer-turned-down-102015", "http://www.truebluela.com/2015/10/22/9592822/tim-wallach-interview-nationals-manager", "http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/writer/jon-heyman/25332673/marlins-have-keen-interest-in-don-mattingly-if-he-becomes-available", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/DannyKnobler/status/657202231306027008"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:22:12.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
