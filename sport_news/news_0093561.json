Madison Bumgarner wins a World Series almost on his own. Murphy, a 62-home run man, career, hits seven in the playoffs and the Mets are in the World Series. Escobar, a career .262 hitter, batted .478 against the Blue Jays. \nThe closest to a shocking performance with the Jays, and it may not have been shocking considering the season he had, was the start Marco Estrada made in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. \nThe Jays needed somebody to more than great. Jose Bautista had the moments: The home run to eliminate Texas in Round 1; the two home runs in rainy Game 6 to tie the score late. His moments also included Lorenzo Cain scoring from first base on a base hit to right field, after Eric Hosmer faked out Bautista — and he made the wrong throw. \nA great moment, then one not so great. \nThat was the Blue Jays story of the post-season. They lost with their best reliever, Roberto Osuna, on the mound, after their set-up man, Aaron Sanchez, couldn’t get the one out he needed. \nThis is a magical time of the year and the Jays ran out of magic. They had no Murphy. They had no Escobar. They had no one who came from nowhere and changed the game every day. \nTHIS AND THAT \nHow important is pre-scouting? According to a fascinating report by Sports Illustrated’s Tom Verducci on Saturday, Kansas City knew when David Price was throwing certain pitches based on his breathing patterns. “In that one game, it looked like they knew what he was throwing,” a Blue Jays executive said. Maybe they did. Wherever the information came from, the Royals seemed to know when and how Price was throwing changeups ... Yovani Gallardo, the Blue Jays killer, is a free agent, but the Jays don’t seem to be terrifically interested ... If he’s available, the Jays will look hard at Jeff Samardzija, whom they’ve tried to trade for two seasons in a row ... Weird coincidence. On July 30, 2004, the Kansas City Royals traded a player to the New York Mets. His name: Jose Bautista. That same day, the Mets turned around and traded Bautista to Pittsburgh. On Tuesday, the Mets play the Royals in the World Series ... Sustained offence was a problem for the Jays in the post-season. The catchers hit .128, Ryan Goins batted .139, Troy Tulowitzki, in between big hits, batted .205. And even though Ben Revere tied for team lead in hits, he batted .255 and Josh Donaldson hit just .244. And the injured Edwin Encarnacion, who hit one home run every 3.74 games in the season, hit one home run in 11 playoff games ... Can’t remember a better Toronto season for any team, any time. The championship seasons of 1992 and 1993 weren’t this much fun. They ended better. But the build, the excitement, the way it affected people, there was never anything like this before ... In brief playoff stints for the Leafs, Raptors and Blue Jays of the past few years, one similarity remains: The players, in each case, were blown away by fan interest and investment in the team. Fans deserve some success around here. More than they’ve ever had. \nHEAR AND THERE \nIn the hottest streak of Nazem Kadri’s NHL career, he scored 15 points in 10 games, including five multi-point games and looked like he was starting to be a great NHL player. That didn’t last long. Since then, in the past 103 games, he has scored 51 points: Which is just 41-point pace over an 82-game season. Which is really average ... John Tortorella was happy to take the Team USA job for the World Cup because he thought it would be his entrance back to the mainstream of hockey. Little did he know he’d wind up back in the NHL quickly, as coach of the soon to be named Columbus Strait Jackets ... Connor McDavid, still learning, still figuring it all out, has more goals than Sidney Crosby, John Tavares, Tyler Seguin and the same number as Patrick Kane, Alex Ovechkin and Vladimir Tarasenko. I know it’s early, but that has to make anybody who loves hockey smile ... I’d have been more impressed if the Leafs had recalled Bob Froese ... Been around thousands of pro athletes. Few have impressed me more than Mark Buehrle ... That’s set-for-life money for Tristan Thompson, the power forward from Brampton. Good for him. He has to play a dirty game in Cleveland to succeed and not much comes naturally to him ... Have been proud to be part of The Reporters with Dave Hodge for the past 13 seasons, Sunday mornings on TSN. Season 14 begins Monday, yes Monday. New time, 4:30 or 7:30 p.m. Same old cast. \nSCENE AND HEARD \nStarting today at quarterback in the NFL: Zach Mettenberger. I thought he was our hockey writer? ... A baseball insider: One of the reasons umpires have such a hard time calling Wade Davis’ pitches is they have so much movement on them, while being thrown with such speed .... The David Price story written by Jeff Passan of Yahoo, indicating Price was being mistreated by the Blue Jays had no attribution. But I can tell you from experience: A guy of that reputation doesn’t write this kind of story without somebody whispering in his ear, be it Price, his agent, or a family member ... Our old pal Sam Mitchell gets to coach Andrew Wiggins for the entire season in Minnesota with Flip Saunders now declared out for the season while battling cancer ... How much does managing matter in a big game? John Gibbons made the right moves Friday night. If he had done what Ned Yost did, the off-season would be all about canning him. But Yost survived his own decisions and won. Gibbons lost with his reputation improved ... In one of Gibbons’ last pro seasons as a player, he played for Albuquerque of the Pacific Coast League. His manager: Terry Collins, now managing the Mets ... The New York starting pitchers in the World Series are Jacob deGrom, (27) Matt Harvey (26) Steven Matz (24) and Noah Syndergaard (22). Haircuts are optional. \nAND ANOTHER THING \nA conversation post-game Friday night: “Did you see the President?” one reporter asked. “Obama was here?” another answered. “No, it was (Paul) Beeston,” said a third voice, of the outgoing team president ... So long, Beeston. And thanks. Thanks for being you. Thanks for everything ... Who starts at second base next year, Devon Travis or Goins? ... And does Aaron Sanchez remain in the bullpen or go back to the starting rotation, where he could re-open a personal competition with the emerging star, Syndergaard? ... The Blue Jays have $20 million in Buehrle money, almost $7 million in Price money and if they pick up R.A. Dickey’s $12-million option, that means they’ll have about $30 million to spend in the off-season on pitching. If they don’t bring Dickey back, that number is more than $40 million ... Don’t know if this is good or bad for the CFL, but ancient Henry Burris seems a sure-thing to be Most Outstanding Player in the Eastern Division ... Happy birthday to Wendel Clark (49), Joe Siddall (48), Mike Eruzione (61), Rejean Houle (66), Pedro Martinez (44), Dave Cowens (67) and Bobby Knight (75) ... And hey, whatever became of Sid Bream? \nRESPONSIBILITIES THE HOLD UP FOR AA \nHere’s what I’ve come to learn about the holdup Alex Anthopoulos is having re-signing as general manager with the Toronto Blue Jays. \nHe wants to come back. New president Mark Shapiro wants him back. The owner, Rogers Inc., wants him back. \nBut this isn’t about money or term, the usual contractual bugaboos. This is about job responsibility. Shapiro has already gone on record as saying he wants Anthopoulos as his GM, but what Shapiro has yet to make clear is what exactly his responsibilities will be once he joins the Jays on Nov. 1. \nThis may not be unlike the David Dombrowski situation in Boston, where Dombrowski took over as president, said he wanted to keep Ben Cherington as GM, but Cherington decided to leave because he didn’t like the way his job was structured under Dombrowski. \nIt could be he same situation here. Anthopoulos doesn’t want to go anywhere — he loves the city and the team — but he doesn’t want to lose any of the responsibilities he has earned along the way. \nIf Shapiro wants to be too hands-on in baseball matters, don’t be surprised if Anthopoulos declines whatever offer comes his way. This isn’t about title or term. It’s about real responsibilities. And really, considering what Anthopoulos has accomplished and what happened this season, all this should have been settled long ago. \nESTRADA SHOULD BE FIRST PRIORITY \nThe question used to be: Can the Blue Jays re-sign David Price? The question needs to be readdressed now: Can the Jays re-sign Marco Estrada? \nFrom the time Estrada established himself in the Jays starting rotation, he was one of the better pitchers in the American League. In the post-season, he was the Jays’ most dependable starter. And without having Price’s pedigree or history, both high-end pitchers are free agents, but will seek and command different salary levels. \nIn a way it’s like house shopping. Price and Estrada are both terrific homes, but in varying neighbourhoods. Price is the Bridal Path of pitchers; Estrada is a suburban guy. The houses could be similar, but in the end you’re paying for performance and comfort. \nIt makes sense for Estrada to trust himself and sign with the Jays — considering how well he pitched here — at a price somewhere around $10 million a season. It may cost three times that for Price, who will find a limited number of big financial players in his world. \nThe Jays should focus on Estrada first and then worry about whether they’re even a player in the limited Price Sweepstakes. Internally, signing Estrada should be the Jays’ most pressing priority of the coming weeks. Chasing Price is a luxury item they may not want to afford. \nWHAT WAS BABCOCK DOING? \nI wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it myself: But there they were the Maple Leafs the other night, with their $50-million coach, beginning 3-on-3 overtime with Daniel Winnik and Nick Spaling as their forwards. \nCombined goals scored this season: One. \nMike Babcock likely had a terrific reason for starting them, but sometimes coaches think too much. They outsmart themselves. Babcock likes to talk about accountability, but how is the coach being accountable when he puts Plumber 1 and Plumber 2 on to begin 3-on-3? \nIt’s not fair to his players, fair to grinders Winnik and Spaling, fair to the ever-faithful Leafs fan base. \nOvertime is a place for skill. And what Babcock may be saying by starting with Winnik and Spaling is he doesn’t believe the team has much skill up front.
