Illinois at Iowa capsule preview WHEN: 11 a.m. Saturday\nWHERE: Kinnick Stadium, Iowa City \nTV: ESPN2 \nRADIO: WCVS (96.7 FM), WFMB (1450 AM and 107.1 FM), WKXQ (92.5 FM), WSMI (106.1 FM) \nRECORDS: Illinois 4-1 overall, 1-0 in Big Ten West; Iowa 5-0, 1-0 Big Ten West \nSERIES RECORD: Illinois leads 38-30-2. \nTHE LINE: Iowa is a 10½-point favorite. \nPREDICTION: Iowa 20, Illinois 13 \nIOWA: Coach Kirk Ferentz is looking for his second 6-0 start in 17 seasons with the Hawkeyes. He’s 120-85 overall and 69-60 in the Big Ten Conference in that span. … A win in would improve the Hawkeyes to 6-0 for the first time since 2009 after starting Big Ten play with a 10-6 win over Wisconsin last week. … Iowa is the first ranked opponent Illinois has faced since falling to No. 1 Ohio State 55-14 last November. … The Hawkeyes have scored 41 points off turnovers through five games after scoring 35 off turnovers in all of 2014. … Iowa is the only school in the country that has yet to allow a rushing touchdown. … Hawkeyes kicker Marshall Koehn’s 57-yard field to defeat Pittsburgh 27-24 Sept. 19 was the second longest in school history. \nNCAA RANKINGS: Iowa — Offense: rushing 185.8 yards per game (54th); passing 209.8 (82nd); total 395.6 (72nd); scoring 32.2 points per game (49th). Defense: rushing 84.4 yard allowed per game (10th); passing 215.4 (64th); total 299.8 (19th); scoring 15.4 points allowed per game (16th). \nIllinois — Offense: rushing 155.8 (T-91st); passing 244.4 (48th); total 400.2 (68rd); scoring 30.2 (62nd). Defense: rushing 126.0 (33rd); passing 177.4 (29th); total 303.4 (21st); scoring 17.8 (T-23nd). \nILLINI INJURY REPORT: RB Josh Ferguson (out), WR Mike Dudek (out), WR Justin Hardee (out), LEO Sean Adesanya (out), TE Tim Clary (out), DL Jamal Milan (out), OL Zach Heath (out), DL Brandon Roberts (out) RB Reggie Corbin (out for season), DB Patrick Nelson (out for season), RB Dre Brown (out for season), DL Teko Powell (out for season). \nThere was no question which receiver Wes Lunt would target when Illinois entered the red zone on the cusp of its 14-13 victory over Nebraska last Saturday. With the end zone seven yards away and the Illini trailing 13-7, Lunt told senior wideout Geronimo Allison to expect the ball to come his way and restated his confidence in his top receiver. Lunt proved it further when he threw five of his last six passes to Allison, ending with a 1-yard touchdown in game’s final 10 seconds. “Over this offseason, we spent a lot of time together throwing in the summer and spring,” said Lunt, a Rochester High School graduate. “We’ve just got a real good feel for one another, and it’s just gotten better.” The bond between the veterans will once again be tested when Illinois (4-1 overall, 1-0 in the Big Ten West) faces No. 22 Iowa (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten West) at Iowa City, but for more reasons than just playing a tough opponent. Receivers Justin Hardee and Mike Dudek are once again listed as out on the injury report, and senior running back Josh Ferguson joins them after being ruled out with a shoulder injury sustained last Saturday. To put that in perspective, those three have played in nine more career games than the combined total of the remaining 17 wide receivers and running backs active on the roster. “The pressure is on,” Allison said. “It’s been on since the start of the season from a wide receiver standpoint. I’m just trying to do my best to lead the younger guys and stay healthy myself.” It’s a job made easier with help from the Illinois defense, which is comprised entirely of upperclassmen starters and ranks among the top 25-ranked defenses in the country based on points allowed. After serving as the Big Ten’s punching bag in terms of defense throughout the past few seasons, Illinois looks to have finally found an identity that first started showing in the final two games of last season. The Illini defense that held just one Big Ten opponent to less than 300 yards of total offense in 2014 has already matched that marked after its first conference game. Illinois is also tied with Iowa in the conference with seven interceptions, the same number the Illini finished with last season. “That’s the one thing we’re about is rushing and getting off the ball and making that quarterback struggle,” senior defensive end Jihad Ward said. “We’ve just got to keep doing our job and stick together.” Page 2 of 2 - That said, the same Illinois defense also coughed up 471 total yards Sept. 19 in its 48-14 collapse at North Carolina, following a familiar trend in road-game matchups. The Illini are 2-13 in regular-season road games since the start of the 2012 season. “For our kids, we’ve just got to stay with the process, understand what we’re trying to do every day, and I think they’ll do that,” Illinois interim coach Bill Cubit said. “They’re buying in pretty well for us.” — Jordan Wilson can be reached at wilsn07@yahoo.com.
