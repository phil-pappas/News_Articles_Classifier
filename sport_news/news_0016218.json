So two runners on, nobody out, Edwin Encarnacion at the dish, just the scenario manager John Gibbons might have hoped for.\nBut E.E. struck out looking, Chris Colabello lined out to left field and Troy Tulowitzki was also punched out without taking the wood off his shoulders on the seventh pitch of that at-bat.\nNothing to show for any of it, a ripe opportunity to get themselves back into the game before Kansas City manager Ned Yost had the chance to call upon his outstanding dominant bullpen, an area where the Royals enjoy a significant edge over Toronto.\nTulowitzki, apart from his heroic jack in Game 4 against the Rangers, has largely continued his hitting blues into the post-season. For playing at all, however, with a recently cracked scapula, he gets a pass. And his defence had been, in the main, trademark sharp, including a marvellous 4-6-3 double-play.\nBut these long lapses in Toronto hitting, where they have trouble wringing out a measly single with men on base, are mystifying. They’re also becoming a worrisome trend in the post-season.\nVolquez was nowhere near masterful yet the Jays — so lethal with the bats in the regular season, dominating nearly every offensive category — could get no more than two hits off him through six, nothing at all till the fourth, and certainly never came close to mounting a threat.\nBalls hit hard were mostly hit directly at Royals, with no counter to the shift except from Ryan Goins of all people, with his first hit of the playoffs in the fifth, smacked sharply up the middle in the fifth, to no avail.\nKauffman Stadium is no hitter-friendly Rogers. So they don’t build their teams to crank homers.\nThey don’t bash, they knick and saw and turn the lathe. They are Bob the Builder-like. Un-bashing, un-dashing. Nowhere near as exciting as a year ago, from Wild Card to seven-game-stretch World Series.\nToronto manager John Gibbons, who was the bench coach here for three years between Blue Jays engagements (and a brief dip into Double-A ball), saw it coming, in a fashion, several hours before the Royals tucked Game 1 of the American League Championship Series into their back pocket.\n“For the most part, they’re a free-swinging team. They put the ball in play. They probably manufacture runs better than anybody in baseball.’’\nThat’s certainly how the Royals got to Toronto starter Marco Estrada in the early going, making the most out of not very much — a leadoff double by Alex Gordon in the third, then, one strikeout later and back around the top of the order, a stand-up double by Alcides Escobar, his second of the night, which brought Gordon in to score the Royals’ first run. Followed shortly thereafter by a base hit single the other way from Lorenzo Cain, cashing in a big two-out run, up 2-0.\nThe only major mistake Estrada committed in his 5 1/3 innings of work was a fastball down the middle of the plate in the fourth which Salvador Perez drilled over the wall in left, which made it 3-0. And so it went.\nPerhaps the Jays were messed up in the head, first time in a week they were playing a game and not facing elimination.\nBetter snap out of the hitting doldrums soon or they’ll be back in that in that twisted sphincter spot.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays flat as Royals take Game 1 of ALCS\nFive moments that mattered from Blue Jays’ loss in Game 1 of ALCS", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:49:36.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
