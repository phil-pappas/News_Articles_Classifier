(John E. Sokolowski/USA TODAY Sports) Article \nIt's easy to lose sight of where Toronto FC stands relative to where it was this time two years ago. \nMaybe it's selective amnesia. Maybe it's Toronto's glass half-empty sports culture in general. \nEither way, the critics are still waiting on the Reds to win something -- a playoff game, a Supporters' Shield, an MLS Cup. \nUntil then, there will be hesitation. \nIt doesn't matter that the Reds are a lock to make the post-season. Or that this has been TFC's best year in close to a decade of history. \nFans are constantly waiting for the rug to be pulled out from under this club -- a banana peel moment, if you will. \nThat moment still could come. Quite frankly, this Toronto FC side is more than capable of losing a first-round playoff game. \nBut the fact they're here says something. \nWhen general manager Tim Bezbatchenko took charge in late 2013, he closed his eyes and plugged his nose. That's how much of a disgrace the roster he inherited was. \nIt contained 20 guys who are no longer in the league. Guys who weren't even close to good enough. Five of them have since stopped playing the game completely. \nThe Reds were 4-14-11 when Bezbatchenko joined the fold, with fans leaving in droves. \nFormer Toronto mayor and TFC season seat holder David Miller even penned a memo telling MLSE he could no longer stomach being at games. \nYou know it's bad when elected officials are no longer on board. \nTwo years on, Bezbatchenko's fingerprints are all over a roster containing just four players from the start of his tenure . \nHe handpicked his head coach. He signed all three of the club's high-dollar players. \nHe's as responsible for the good as much as he is the bad. \nWhat can't be disputed, though, is the fact he has this franchise in position to do something a lot of people have tried to and failed to achieve: Get TFC into the post-season. \n\"We've taken steps forward as an organization over the course of this season,\" Bezbatchenko told the Toronto Sun in an exclusive one-on-one this week. \n\"You look at the records and style of play and we feel like we've taken a step forward. The goal is to make the playoffs. We believe and agree that it doesn't matter until the end unless we accomplish our goal -- which is to make the playoffs. \n\"Even then, it's not good enough. We want to compete for championships. It's not good enough until we've won in the playoffs.\" \nFor some, that needs to happen now. Supporters and pundits rarely separate the club's current front office, its current players, from eight seasons of futility. Until further notice, someone, somewhere is saying, \"same old TFC.\" \nThe club hears it. The players feel it. Like it or not, they have to live with it. \n\"These players haven't been around for eight years,\" Bezbatchenko said. \"The weight of our history is unnecessarily heavy on some of our players. They've embraced it and taken on the challenge. \n\"We made it even heavier by playing seven games on the road to start the season and by missing players during the Gold Cup. I have to commend our players for taking it on and not making excuses. \n\"Our guys don't make excuses. They don't talk about how it has been unfair or that they've been treated unnecessarily harsh.\" \nOr that the bar is continuously being raised month after month. Until recently, attaining a playoff berth had always been the goal. \nThen it was hosting a playoff game. Then it was winning a home playoff game. Then it was advancing beyond that stage. \n\"Even when we (make the playoffs) it's still not good enough,\" Bezbatchenko added. \"But there's a little bit of the glass half-empty, self-loathing in this marketplace. \n\"On the positive side, though, we get to be the group that breaks through that barrier and that makes history. That's why I came here. It's why Greg took the head coaching job and it's why Michael Bradley came here. \n\"If you look at the list of people who have tried to do what we're about to do it's pretty incredible.\" \nYou'd need an entire TFC Memorial to list off the personnel that have come and gone -- a list approaching that of the Toronto Blue Jays, who finally won the AL East after 22 years. \n\"This is (Blue Jays GM) Alex Anthopoulos' sixth year with the Jays,\" Bezbatchenko said. \"We're in Year 2, but we're trending well.\" \nIf all goes well, the Reds could finish as high as second in the Eastern Conference -- a huge achievement that would afford them a first-round bye. \n\"This is a time to celebrate,\" Bezbatchenko said. \"This is a time to be positive. \n\"That's what we're being in the club. It's a little hard when people don't have the proper perspective on what this club has gone through and what these players have gone through and how they've evolved over the past 18 months.\" \nLooking at the big picture, there have been more good player acquisitions than bad. And the staff -- top to bottom -- appears to be in sync. \nThat doesn't mean there aren't deficiencies. The Reds are conceding buckets of goals despite turning to Europe for defensive difference-makers. \n\"We know we're not going to bat a thousand,\" Bezbatchenko said of acquiring foreign players. \"In MLS, for internationals, if you're getting half of your guys right you're doing well.\" \nThe best player in the league has put up never-before-seen numbers, and critics have suggested he's the only reason for TFC's success this season. \n\"Would the Chicago Bulls be great without Michael Jordan? Do people write about that?\" Bezbatchenko asked facetiously. \n\"It's the wrong question to ask. Kudos to Greg for building a team that allows a team with Giovinco to be successful.\" \nThat said, paying top dollar for three attack-minded players has come at a cost defensively. \nThe Reds have had goalkeeping issues at times this season and continue to search for a full-time right fullback. It's a roster still in transition. \n\"We have given some stuff up defensively, obviously,\" Bezbatchenko said. \"Do I think there are times the team needs to be working harder collectively? Yes. But, overall, the work ethic is there.\" \nWe couldn't say that two years ago, when then bench boss Ryan Nelsen fielded players like Reggie Lambe, Darel Russell and Justin Braun, among a litany of other fringe MLSers. \nCompared to then, the Reds are in much better shape with three home matches and a massive away date at Montreal remaining. \n\"You can't judge this team until the end of the season,\" Bezbatchenko added. \nNo matter when that is, there's certainly an argument progress has been made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:23:16.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
