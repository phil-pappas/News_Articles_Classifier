He was limited in practice Friday and is officially listed as questionable on the injury report.\n“I wouldn’t put a percentage or number on it,” Decker said of his chances of playing. “I know I feel better this week than I did last week. Every day this week has gotten better, so I’m just trying to manage everything on a daily basis. In pregame, we’ll see where I’m at.”\nThe Jets missed Decker last week with the offense looking sluggish in his absence. Decker said the Jets having a bye next week won’t factor into his decision. He could rest the knee for three full weeks if he sits out Sunday.\n“I know it’s there. I’m not going to lie about it,” Decker said. “But that’s not going to determine or push me in a certain direction. It’s been day-to-day for me ever since Indy. Just kind of got to go on how I feel and really consult with the trainers and Coach Bowles and make the best decision for all of us.”\nThe offense will definitely be getting back another of its weapons. Running back Chris Ivory is “full go,” according to coach Todd Bowles. Ivory missed last week with a quad injury.\nDecker is the only player listed as questionable on the injury report. Cornerback Darrelle Revis (hamstring) and Ivory are probable. Linebacker Trevor Reilly (finger) has been ruled out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:07:05.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
