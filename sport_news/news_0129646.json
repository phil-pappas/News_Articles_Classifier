In spite of drought, plague, mudslides and wildfire... tourism is up! The reasons: strong world economies, ongoing interest in and knowledge of our Western heritage and public parks, affordable travel, and most vitally for Tuolumne County — a concerted effort by many to promote the historic and natural treasures of our region. Many work to preserve this world class travel destination: health and safety officers to individual business owners, public servants to private citizens — hundreds make it their business to keep Tuolumne County a top tier destination for visitors. That includes this newspapers’ promoting our local attractions: it is gratifying to see you feature much of what our townships and arts groups have to offer. I can attest our living Gold Rush town of Columbia is thriving due to your splendid coverage of events like the upcoming Fiddle & Bango Contest. Even with a few shuttered shops awaiting new life [attn. potential Mercantile and St. Charles Saloon operators!] the return of The City Hotel with the wonderful What Cheer Saloon epicurean menu, and the Jack Douglass with taco Fridays, sushi Saturdays and all around great atmosphere, Columbia State Historic Park has risen from the ashes to become a local favorite again. Even the State has apparently decided to keep the historic flavor of town by parking their modern vehicles more discretely. Hopefully, our elected officials will see the light and keep the Columbia Corridor Historic by vetoing all blight attracting proposals like the Dollar General at Leti’s, [the site of past toxic businesses: ancient gas tanks and sandal factory chemicals]. Our County Board of Supervisors have the authority and power to keep our region attractive and worthy of tourism, let’s hope they have the wisdom. R.D. Haratani In Memoriam: Freedom To the Editor: All is lost, Freedom no more. And, for the first time in history, it’s not Obama’s fault. Just as I learned of the existence of a House Freedom Caucus, our beloved Representative Tom McClintock resigns from it. His powerful voice of destructive criticism will no longer be heard in the hallowed halls of Freedom. The reason is apparent in his resignation letter: The caucus is not Republican enough. He puts the fault squarely on his caucus’s leadership. It had the audacity of disagreeing with him more than once. Instead, “[a]t the behest of its board, most HFC members combined with the vast majority of House Democrats” (McC’s words). What could Democrats possibly know about freedom? After all, it’s one of the terms “owned” by Republicans — like “family values” and “national security”. McClintock remains, of course, our county’s man in DC. Until next year, that is, when voters will elect a whole new House of Representatives. Klaus Kraemer Suggestion box To the Editor: Would it be too much to ask The Union Democrat to give us a little less regular diet of Liberal, often under-thought and mind numbing, screeds? I’m particularly referring to acolytes of the Church of the Cranky Climate but also other ‘regulars’ that seem to have a need to spread Liberal talking points every two weeks. This small group of letter writers are using the Letters to the Editor sector as their bi-monthly column — almost always maxing out the word limit. Perhaps returning to a once a month limit would produce a lot less tedious repetition. Besides, we are $19 trillion in debt and we’re trying to figure out how much we should spend on trying to change the weather?
