(AP Photo/Wade Payne) \n(RNN) - In its three losses this season, Tennessee has lost by a combined 12 points. \nThat’s a misleading stat, though. The Volunteers’ games have been even closer than that. \nThis team, which was lauded in the offseason as a much-improved-upon franchise, is 12 points away from being undefeated and leading the SEC East, as many predicted they would. \nAs it is now, however, Tennessee sits at 2-3 and winless in conference play. That’s why this weekend’s game is so crucial. \nWhen the reeling Volunteers host Georgia on Saturday, it’s likely their last chance to carve out a piece of the SEC East race - they’re going to need a lot of help even if they win, but it’s about proving a point, too. \nLuckily, Tennessee isn’t the only team reeling. Georgia was blew out by Alabama last week, which gave Florida sole control of the SEC East. \nSpeaking of the Gators, there is no team with more hype surrounding them than Florida. It’s still a little too soon for that, though. \nTheir opponent this week is plagued by an injury at the signal caller position and flying under the radar, but the Missouri Tigers still deserve respect. \nThey are, after all, the reigning two-time SEC East champ. If Florida wants the throne, it will have to depose the incumbent king. \nGeorgia vs Tennessee \nPlayer to look out for: Someone in Tennessee’s passing game \nThis may look like a cop-out at first, but, at this point, the Volunteers are begging for anyone to show up. \nQuarterback Joshua Dobbs received a lot of attention in the offseason, and he was expected to be a big part of Tennessee’s success. Any preseason ideas haven't come to fruition yet. \nWhile Dobbs has managed to remain an electrifying player, he hasn’t been able to generate consistent offense through the air. Even when Dobbs was the leading passer, rusher and receiver during the Vols’ game against Florida, he still only managed to pass for 83 yards. Oh, and his team lost a heartbreaker. \nThe junior quarterback isn’t necessarily losing games for the Tennessee, but the team needs more from its passing game. The Volunteers have given up big leads in each of their losses, which could have been remedied with a little more octane on offense. \nThe receivers are to blame as well. Tennessee doesn’t have a receiver with more than 157 yards receiving. \nSomething has to change for Tennessee, and this is the perfect week to do it. A win over Georgia is exactly what the team needs to restore much-needed confidence, and the schedule isn’t going to get any easier with Alabama looming on the horizon. \nFlorida vs Missouri \nPlayer to look out for: Missouri QB Drew Lock \nMissouri is the two-time champion of the SEC East. That’s quite the feat for a team that’s only been a member of the conference since 2012. \nThe Tigers are far from a favorite to represent the conference in Atlanta again this year, but they cannot be ruled out, as proven by the last two years. \nThis week will truly test the grit of Tigers. When they square off against the new hottest team in the SEC, Florida, they’ll be going at it without veteran quarterback Maty Mauk. \nMauk, who was recently suspended, led Missouri in both of its appearances in the title game. In his shoes now is Drew Lock, a true freshman. \nLock performed admirably last week against South Carolina. He tossed two touchdowns and went 21-28 for 136 yards. Most importantly, he protected the ball. \nThis week, however, he’s going up against one of the best defenses in the SEC. \nThere isn’t much material to analyze Lock on. So the breakdown is simple - he must protect the ball like he did against a lesser team last week if he wants to find a win. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network. All rights reserved.
