So has unbeaten Delaware Valley. Now they get the opportunity to stop each other. \nThe Mid-State 38 Conference divisional leaders — Cranford (6-0, 4-0) in the Raritan and Delaware Valley (6-0, 3-0) in the Mountain — meet Friday night at Tapp Webb Field in Alexandria. Game time is 7 p.m. \nCranford has won five of six meetings in the series, with Del Val not winning since 2010 — a 36-35 overtime contest. The Cougars seem as good as ever, said Del Val coach Mike Columbo. \n\"They are a complete team,'' said Columbo. \"It's not what they can't do but what they can. They have everything you'd want as a coach.'' \nSounds exactly how Cranford coach Erik Rosenmeier feels about Del Val. While Cranford is comfortably ahead in the North 2 Group III power-points race, Del Val comfortably leads the Central Group II field. \n\"They are good up front, and they are really good at what they do (single wing offense),. and if you think that anybody has been able to really replicate it in practice ... no way ... if you think you have a good plan because your scout team can't run it on you...'' said Rosenmeier. \"The only way we are fortunate is that we have been playing Mike (Columbo), and GL (Governor Livingston) runs a similar offense. It goes back to when (former coach Jim) Benedict was running it at Summit and Watchung Hills. When Steve (former Scotch Plains-Fanwood coach Steve Ciccotelli, for whom Rosenmeier was an assistant) and I saw it we were like. 'What the heck is this?’ ” \nDel Val has run for 1,567 yards with senior Cory Shedlock (104-779-8) and senior quarterback Joey Donnelly (77-402-4) out front with the numbers, but others have been becoming bigger factors. Namely senior Ryan Romaine (30-167-3) and junior Nick Perno and senior Derek Kugelman. Then there's the chance Donnelly (7-14-293-4-3) will throw the ball downfield — way downfield — to his brother Matt (4-160-2) or Romaine (3-64-1). When Del Val throws it, it's virtually to inflict a dagger, a home run if you will. Donnelly has completed seven passes — four of them for touchdowns. \n\"If you look in the backfield, we have told our kids, you'll turn to stone,'' added Rosenmeier. \nThe Cougars usually attack from an empty backfield and throw it quite a bit but are still a run-first team. They rushed for 414 yards in last week's 51-17 rout of Hillside — 207 in the first half and 207 in the second. Senior quarterback Jack Schetelich had 119 yards and three touchdowns on 15 carries. Junior back Ryan Bakie carried nine times for 106 yards, including a one yard TD scoot and a 33-yard score on a pitch and run. \nSenior tackle and Penn State commit Will Fries (6-6, 280) and senior guard/defensive tackle Kevin Doran (6-3, 275) are a big reason the Cougars have run for 1,620 yards and 25 touchdowns. Schetelich has run for 637 and 10 touchdowns on 100 carries. He has thrown for 692 yards and seven touchdowns and been intercepted just twice. \nSchetelich's breakthrough game against Del Val two years ago as a sophomore, when he rallied his team from a 6-0 deficit to a 30-13 victory. Schetelich's chance came when quarterback Johnny Oblachinski left with an ankle injury. Schetelich wound up running for 135 yards and a touchdown. \n\"He reminds me of (former Del Val QB Chris Fennell now playing lacrosse at the US Naval Academy),'' said Columbo. \nSenior Joe Norton — a three-sport athlete — has caught 15 passes for 317 yards and three touchdowns, has an interception on defense, and is averaging 36.3 yards per 10 punts. He is also 31-of-32 in point-after-touchdown attempts and 1-for-2 in field goals. Del Val's Romain has averaged 35.5 yards per 19 punts and is 26-for-26 in PAT and 2-for-3 in field goal attempts with a long of 31. \nSenior defensive end Marshall McPeek and junior lineman Brad Apgar have been part of the talent that has led a very athletic program. McPeek leads the team with 12 quarterback hurries, and Apgar has a team-leading four sacks. The Terrier defense that is usually good for one touchdown per game — whether it's an interception or fumble return. Junior defensive back Sean Lessig has a interception return for a touchdown; senior linebacker Jake Soltis has returned two fumbles for scores; and Kugelman (a linebacker on defense) and junior linebacker Kenny Henderson have returned fumbles for scores. 41 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LPRMmY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:37:00.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
