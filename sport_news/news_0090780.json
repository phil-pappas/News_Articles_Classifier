The money would have been put in a trust fund and given to them when they left school.\nThe decision came in a lawsuit filed by UCLA basketball star Ed O’Bannon and 19 others.\nThe NCAA was accused of violating antitrust laws by conspiring to block the athletes from getting a share of revenue generated by the use of their images.\nThe NCAA said paying college athletes would destroy its system of amateurism, and the rules designed to protect that system had never previously been found by courts to violate antitrust law.\nNCAA attorney Seth Waxman cited a 1984 US Supreme Court ruling during oral arguments before the 9th Circuit in March. The ruling said athletes must not be paid in order to preserve the character and quality of college athletics.\nPlaintiffs’ attorney Michael Hausfeld countered that the Supreme Court’s comment was made in passing and was not integral to the outcome of that case.\n  ncaa ,  scholarships", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:26:09.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
