Kennedy International Airport. \nThe 24,000 square-foot space - less than half the size of a football field - outside JFK's Terminal 5 is meant to educate travelers more than actually feed them. Although eventually JetBlue would like to serve items grown there in ter­minal restaurants and even make some blue potato Terra Chips that are served on flights. \nOne day, if the airport allows it, there might even be animals, such as bees and butterflies. \nThe goal is to try and teach peo­ple about farming and to improve the appearance of the terminal's exterior. \n\"We know people like green space. It's what they have at home. Why not put that at an airport if that's what they love and want?\" said Sophia Leonora Mendelsohn, the New York-based airline's head of sustainability. \"Your flying expe­rience starts on the ground.\" \nBuilding a farm at an airport is not simple: It took JetBlue three years to get approval. \nAirports are concerned about anything that would attract wildlife, especially birds. That means no growing tomatoes, corn, berries, seeds or sunflowers in its new garden. (The airline originally wanted to grow wheat and use it to make its own JetBlue JFK beer.) \nSo instead, JetBlue is focusing on potatoes, chives, basil, carrots and other plants deemed safe. \nThe airline expects to grow 1,000 potato plants, yielding more than 1,000 pounds of spuds every four to six months, along with an ad­ditional 1,100 plants such as mint, arugula, beets, garlic, onions and spinach. \nThe project is in partnership with GrowNYC, a nonprofit envi­ronmental group that focuses on improving New York City block by block. Students will be brought in from local schools to learn about gardening. \nSome of the herbs and produce will be used by restaurants in JetBlue's terminal, others will be donated to local food banks. \nAll of the plants are grown in plastic milk crates and the struc­ture is designed to withstand 160 mph hurricane-force winds, an­other requirement of the airport's operator.
