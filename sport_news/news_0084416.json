Red Bull 'open' to continuing with Renault engines 1 / 2 Back to Gallery SOCHI, Russia (AP) â€” Red Bull team principal Christian Horner suggested Friday his team could continue using Renault engines for next year, with the team having previously threatened to leave Formula One. Four-time constructor's champion Red Bull's relationship with Renault has collapsed this year as the team seems set for its first winless season since 2008. Without an engine supplier confirmed for next season, development work on Red Bull's new car is hampered and the team's owner has threatened to quit the sport altogether. Asked Friday if continuing with Renault was possible, Horner said \"everything is open.\" Horner held two lengthy meetings Friday with F1 commercial chief Bernie Ecclestone , who said he was confident that Red Bull would return in 2016 and that \"everything's sorted out now\" with its engine problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:22:16.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
