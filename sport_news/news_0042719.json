When you play against a great player, especially if you don’t play to your best, your chances are lower,” Nadal said of the Italian, who beat Uruguay’s Pablo Cuevas 6-1, 2-6, 6-2. \nIn the women’s draw, Ana Ivanovic beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-3, 7-5 to set up a semifinal with Timea Bacsinszky, who recovered to oust Sara Errani 0-6, 6-3, 7-5. \nAgnieszka Radwanska beat Angelique Kerber 6-1, 6-4 to go into a semifinal clash with the in-form Garbine Muguruza, who halted the run of American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-1, 7-5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:35.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
