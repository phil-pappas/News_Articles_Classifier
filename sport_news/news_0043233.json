As one of the longest serving managers in the country, Dean has been instrumental in the club’s progress since his appointment and is fundamental to our future plans.” \nRumours of Rotherham’s rejected approach surfaced yesterday, with Smith among several names on a shortlist to replace Steve Evans, who left last week with the club 21st in the Championship table. What do you think? Log in and start commenting \nAn approach for Burton boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink earlier this week was also rejected. \nAnd though former Leeds manager Neil Redfearn remains favourite, Millers chairman Tony Stewart is understood to be a big admirer of Smith. \nHe has transformed the Saddlers since taking over in January 2011, when they were nine points adrift of safety in League One. \nHe kept them up and has overseen steady progress. Smith led the club to a first-ever Wembley appearance in last season’s Johnstone’s Paint Trophy and they are second in League One.
