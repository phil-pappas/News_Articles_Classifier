In the second and third, K-State hit .060 and .022, respectively. Ten attack errors in the final set hurt the Wildcats, as they led at the 17-13 mark. \nK-State’s defense was able to limit Iowa State, as well, with the Cyclones owning a .179 hitting percentage with the help of K-State’s 69 digs and six blocks. The Cyclones had just 13 attack errors in each of the second and third sets. \nFour Wildcats had double-digit digs, led by 15 from junior Katie Brand. Outside hitters Brooke Sassin and Bryna Vogel totaled 14 and 13, respectively, while Kersten Kober reached double-digits in digs for the 15th time this season with 10. \nJunior Katie Reininger was the lone Wildcat to reach double-digit kills in K-State’s first straight-set loss of the year. The middle blocker had 10 for her third consecutive match of 10 or more kills \nFreshman Macy Flowers and Sassin each had seven kills to tie for the second-highest total on the team. \nK-State spent much of the first set trailing and by as many as five at the 20-15 mark, but one of Reininger’s three kills in the set sparked a 7-2 run for the Wildcats. Over the run, Kober dropped in an ace and Flowers slammed in two of her five first-set kills, but the set-tying point came at the hand of Alyssa Schultejans, who got the touch by Iowa State down the line to even it with a kill. \nThree straight points by Iowa State, however, including two off kills and the final one on a Wildcat attack error, gave the Cyclones the early lead in the match. \nThe second set featured 12 ties by the 13-13 mark with neither side leading by more than two points, but Iowa State went on a 4-0 run that forced the Wildcats to burn their first timeout. \nK-State eventually pulled within two after an Iowa State attack error made it 18-16. But the Wildcats were never able to close the gap any closer. \nThe Cyclones pulled away by as many as six points on two occasions, with the last being at set point, 24-18. A kill by Reininger was followed up by the third K-State block of the set to fight off the first two set points, but Ciara Capezio’s kill sealed the second. \nThe difference early was five Iowa State aces in the first two sets, nearly matching K-State’s season-high return error total for an entire match (at Miami, 7, on August 29). The Wildcats, who finished with six return errors, had been aced five times combined over the previous three matches. \nDown 4-3 early in the third, K-State scored four straight points to help it go on a 6-2 run and force Iowa State to burn both of its timeouts. Over the spurt, four different Wildcats had a kill, with the last by Reininger giving the Wildcats their largest lead of the match at the time, 10-5. Iowa State quickly closed the gap by scoring five straight points, helped by four K-State attack errors (three unforced). \nWith the score tied at 11-all, K-State scored six of the next eight points to open up a 17-13 advantage. Back-to-back kills by Reininger sparked the run while a pair of kills from Sassin opened up the four-point lead. \nIowa State then took the lead for the first time since the 4-3 mark when a 6-2 run was capped by a K-State blocking error that made it 19-18 Cyclones. The Wildcats regained the lead at 20-19 on an Iowa State attack error, but the Cyclones scored six consecutive points to close out the match. \nAfter back-to-back road matches, K-State returns home this Saturday to host West Virginia at 2 p.m. in Bramlage Coliseum. The Wildcats are 4-0 in Manhattan this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:57:08.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
