Pumpkin beers can linger until Thanksgiving. But for one day this weekend, local beer fans get to fuss over brews made with a singular fruit.\nOn Saturday, North Portland's Saraveza will pour nearly 30 different peach beers and ciders for the third-annual Peche Fest. Most are rare, a couple have won major awards and one was at the center of a recent beer-world controversy. (And that's not even counting the one from Ex Novo Brewing called Peaches Ain't Nothing But Gose and Tricks.)\nEven if you go, you probably won't be able to try them all. But there are a few that shouldn't be missed. Here's what to drink at the third-annual Peche Fest:\nElysian Brewing Company, Gourdgia on My Mind\nThe ink was barely dry on Anheuser-Busch InBev's takover of Seattle's Elysian Brewing Company when AB's Budweiser aired its infamous \"Let them sip their pumpkin-peach ale\" Super Bowl commercial. The ad was meant as a crack at craft beer swirling dilettantes in general. The only problem? Elysian actually made such a beer, a pumpkin-peach-pecan number called Gourdgia on My Mind. Peche Fest offers Portlanders a chance to try the brew, little-seen outside of Elysian's own Great Pumpkin Beer Fest. \"In light of Anheuser-Busch's pointedly insulting comments about our Pumpkin Peach Ale ... we decided to omit the pecans for this batch, allowing the peach and pumpkin to take center stage without distraction,\" said Kevin Watson, Elysian's head brewer.\nBlock 15 Brewing, Turbulent Consequence: Peche\nAll of Block 15's beers in their Turbulent Consequence series are made in a coolship, a relatively small and shallow bin used for allowing wort (pre-fermented beer) to cool and attract airborne yeast and bacteria. Nick Arzner paid for the coolship with money he had otherwise earmarked for entering and attending the Great American Beer Festival, the beer industry's largest event. Their first entry? Turbulent Consequence: Peche, which won gold in GABF's Belgian-Style Lambic or Sour Ale category this year. \"Peche is blended once a year,\" says Block 15 owner Nick Arzner. \" I choose barrels in the late summer to add white peaches that I pick with my wife and daughter.\" For most, this is certainly their first and only chance to enjoy the fruits of the Arzner family's labor.\nFort George Brewery, Eat a Peach and Summer Stout\nThis Astoria brewery is bringing two very different beers combined by a common ingredient. From Fort George Brewery in Astoria, the Allman Brothers-inspired Eat a Peach is a 6.8% ABV kettle-soured wheat beer with a whopping 200 pounds of peaches. The acidic tang gives it a light, refreshing quality. Despite its darker color, Fort George's other entry, Summer Stout, is actually lighter in body and alcohol at 5.3% ABV. With a malt bill that includes midnight wheat and black barley giving it its darkness, it's brightened with citrusy Cascade hops and organic peaches that were added during secondary fermentation.\nThe complete Peche Fest 2015 lineup\nBlock 15 Brewing: Peche\nBreakside Brewery: Abbey's Crumble\nBurnside Brewing: Gin & Joose\nCrooked Stave: Persica Vintage 2013\nCrooked Stave: Batch #50\nDe Garde Brewing: Peach & Apricot Bu (bottles)\nDogfish Head: Festina Peche\nDouble Mountain: Peche Mode\nEcliptic Brewing/Cigar City Brewing: Ellipsing the Sun\nElysian Brewing: Gourdgia On My Mind Pumpkin Peach Ale\nEpic Brewing: Brainless on Peaches\nEpic Brewing: SOUR Brainless on Peaches\nEx Novo Brewing: Peaches Ain't Nothing but Gose and Tricks\nFinnriver Cider: Country Peach\nFort George: Eat a Peach\nFort George: Summer Stout\nGolden Valley Brewing: Brett Haven\nGreat Divide Brewing: Peach Grand Cru\nHi-Wheel Wine & Mead: Peach Cobbler\nHopworks/New Belgium: B-Side EP Peach Sour\nLaht Neppur Brewing: Peachy Keen\nLogsdon Farmhouse Ales: Peche 'n Brett\nNew Belgium/Hopworks: B-Side Peach IPA\nNew Belgium Brewing: Eric's Ale\n10 Barrel Brewing (Bend): Peachalicious\n10 Barrel Brewing (Portland): Du Peche Mode\n13 Virtues Brewing: Peach Fuzz Pils\nUpright Brewing: Fantasia\nPeche Fest takes place Saturday from 3 to 10 p.m. at Saraveza, 1004 N.
