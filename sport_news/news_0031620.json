This was a Wrigley Field party with all the kids invited — especially slugger Jorge Soler, who has yet to make an out this postseason.\nThe young hitters are paying off earlier than expected.\nA monster in the Midway came alive Monday night with the 8-6 win over the creaking Cardinals at windy Wrigley Field to give the Cubs a 2-1 lead in the NLDS.\nThe Cubs smashed a postseason-record six home runs as batters one through six went deep. Yes, the wind was blowing out, but these were all serious blasts.\nIt was the running of the bulls after each home run in the Cubs dugout, their home-run ritual.\nThis marked the Cubs first postseason win at Wrigley since 2003 — pre-Bartman.\nSo, Anthony Rizzo, one of the six Cubs to club home runs, what was the atmosphere like on this windy and wild Wrigley night?\n“Every time I screamed, personally, I thought I was going to faint,’’ the big first baseman said.\nAnother win Tuesday night and the Cubs will have captured their first-ever postseason series at Wrigley.\nRookies Soler, Kyle Schwarber and Kris Bryant homered as well as Rizzo and young second baseman Starlin Castro, as the Cubbies manhandled Michael Wacha, the bullpen and the 100-win Cardinals. Veteran Dexter Fowler added the sixth home run in the eighth.\n“The wind was blowing out before the game but I wasn’t thinking about that number,’’ Bryant said of the six-pack of home runs.\nWhen Soler homered in the sixth on the first pitch by reliever Adam Wainwright, it marked the fourth hit of his postseason and second home run. He has reached safely in all nine playoff plate appearances, the first time that has ever happened.\n“I’m locked in right now,’’ the massive Soler said through an interpreter. “I have tremendous confidence.’’\nNoted Bryant, “That home run he hit was unbelievable. It was a two-iron.’’\nBryant and Rizzo were a combined 0-for-21 in the postseason when the game began.\nThe baseball world knew the Cubs’ young players were coming, but they have arrived faster than anyone expected, making them such a scary proposition now and into the future.\nSoler is 23. Bryant is the same age. Schwarber is 22. Castro is 25 and Rizzo is 26. Shortstop Addison Russell, who tripled in the fourth, is 21. On the play he injured a hamstring and was replaced by Javier Baez, who is 22.\nSchwarber was the MVP of the Futures Game at the All-Star Game in Cincinnati this July.\nThis was another Futures Game with all this young talent and it made up for a night when Jake Arrieta was finally human.\n“We told Jake we had his back tonight,’’ Castro said.\nA win Tuesday night and the Cubs have a chance to get to the World Series and win their first World Series since 1908.\nThis postseason marks a rebirth for both the Cubs and Mets. This is the first postseason for the Mets since 2006 and the first for the Cubs since 2008. In both 2007 and 2008, while the Mets collapsed, the Cubs were soon getting bounced in the NLDS with three straight losses each year.\nEach franchise has two World Series victories and is craving for success. The Cubs two World Series wins came in 1908 and 1907. Wrigley wasn’t built until 1914.\nThey are due.\nYou can say the same thing for the Mets and their World Series victory years of 1986 and ’69.\nAn NLCS showdown will be something special.\nIf the two teams get there, the Mets may need a little help from a black cat back like the old Miracle Mets days to get past these mighty young Cubs.\nNoted Rizzo, “That was a fun game in general, the best one I’ve ever been a part of.’’\nHey, the fun is just beginning around Wrigley.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under anthony rizzo ,  chicago cubs ,  kris bryant ,  mlb playoffs ,  st. louis cardinals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:32:41.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
