It’s not representative of the talent and character we have in this clubhouse. I think we’ll show a lot better baseball over course of this series. They’re still really confident, as am I.”\nEpstein knows better than most how to overcome a big playoff deficit. Epstein was the general manager of the Red Sox team that stormed back from a 3-0 deficit against the Yankees in the 2004 ALCS to get to the World Series, which they won for the first time in 86 years.\n“There’s a reason they make these important series long,” Epstein said. “We’ve always responded. All year long, we’ve had a winning streak after a stretch of poor play.”\nHe is optimistic the warm weather of Chicago and the familiarity of Wrigley will help.\n“We plan on playing well at home,” Epstein said. “It was kind of a very forgettable first two games from a number of points. They pitched really well right out of the chute. I think we probably hit more balls hard than they did. Give them credit, but we haven’t really played our game yet. I think that starts [Tuesday]. They’ve got to beat us four times.”\n  Filed under boston red sox ,  chicago cubs ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  theo epstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:43:34.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
