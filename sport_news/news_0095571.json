Notwithstanding their physical and mental deficiencies, these specially-abled persons cleaned Ganga ghats with dedication and sincerity. Contrary to the normal photo opportunity that most of the cleanliness drives have these days become, barring that of Gayatri Shantikunj, these specially-abled persons were focused on cleaning Ganga ghats as much as they could. Sandeep Arora, state president of the Hearing-Speech Impaired Association, Uttarakhand, said this was a rare occasion when hundreds of specially-abled persons took to cleaning Ganga ghats, giving a message that if they could contribute to the cleanliness drive why not others. Vikas Sharma, national president of the Disabled Helpline Forum, said over 40 organisations of specially-abled persons took part in the cleanliness drive. Under the aegis of the Bharatiya Viklang Gagna Sewa Sangh, an awareness rally was held in the city in the evening. These volunteers, including visually challenged, raised slogans such as “Bharat Mata ki Jai”, “Ganga Maiyya ki Jai”, and “Vande Matram” and generated awareness about the pollution level in the Ganga. They asked people to adhere to the directives of the National Green Tribunal. They urged the Central and state governments to keep a tab on their agencies tasked with cleaning the Ganga and her tributaries. City legislator Madan Kaushik, Ranipur-BHEL legislator Aadesh Chauhan, social activist Jagdeesh Lal Pahwa, Kuldeep Singh, Ajeet Singh, Har Mohan Singh, Deva Nand Sharma, Rajyavardhan Reddy, Ajay Arora, Amit Dobhal, Apoorva Nautiyal, Manish Negi, Kavita Panchal, and Sukh Ram Kamboj took part in the cleanliness effort. They said today’s drive should be an eyeopener for the government as well to those who directly or indirectly pollute the Ganga. “Many of the participants in today’s drive can’t see, but they can feel the pollution impact on the mother Ganga. If they can see and feel, why can’t normal human beings?,” said Sonia Arora, social activist and state spokesperson for the Hearing–Speech Impaired Association.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:56.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
