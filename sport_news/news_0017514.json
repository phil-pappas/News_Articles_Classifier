The driver fled the scene and was found in a friend's car at 32nd Street and Grange Avenue. \nOn Tuesday, Public Information Officer Sam Clemens said 23-year-old Austin Johnson was at The Nickel Spot, 2918 S Minnesota Ave., during an event. Clemens said Johnson ran out with a cash box and a 30-year-old event employee chased after him. \nPrevious Story: Suspected Thief Knocks Down Woman, Crashes Into Pole \nThe woman was standing the Explorer's running boards while Johnson was driving away. She was left with a broken left arm and right leg, and Clemens said her pregnancy should be unaffected by the injuries. \nClemens said Johnson called 22-year-old Christopher Rave to pick him up. Both were found inside Rave's vehicle nearby. \nJohnson is charged with a DUI, two counts of aggravated assault, vehicular battery, felony hit and run, and petty theft. Rave is charged with his third DUI, petty theft, suspended license, no insurance, and open container. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
