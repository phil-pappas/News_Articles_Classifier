We had great weather at the course and just had a lot of fun out there.”Four-ball golf involves two two-person teams playing against one another, where each teammate plays their own ball. Each hole is scored using the lower score between the two teammates.Playing against Dalton’s Carson Roberts and Chatsworth’s Savannah Satterfield, Barnett eagled the first hole and Doherty birdied No. 2 to put them at 3-under early. The duo parred holes Nos. 3-14 until Doherty birdied 15 to move her and Barnett to 4-under. They parred the 16th and bogeyed 17 before Barnett birdied 18 to secure the victory.“I hit a pitching wedge off the fairway from 106 yards away into the first hole for an eagle on the par-4,” Barnett said. “After we bogeyed the 17th, I made a 15-foot putt for birdie on the par-4 18th, which helped us win the tournament.“It will be exciting and fun to be in a national event. It was just great for Amanda and me to be able to come together and play so well. Hopefully, we’ll be able to do it again in May.”Barnett and Doherty beat Charlotte Daughan of Orlando, Florida, and Mercedes Huarte of Argentina, who shot 68.“Just from being friends, there was a lot of trust between us,” Barnett said. “We had a lot of good shots, and we played well. We just had each other’s backs and didn’t focus on anyone else — just ourselves. When we saw our score compared to everyone else’s, we just couldn’t believe we did it.”The U.S. Women’s Four-Ball made its debut in May, essentially replacing the U.S. Women’s Amateur Public Links Championship. Roswell’s Rinko Mitsunaga, now a freshman at Georgia, won the inaugural event with teammate Mika Liu.
