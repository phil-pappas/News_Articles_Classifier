The hospital authorities said all of them were in a critical condition. Following reports that three patients, including a four-day baby girl, allegedly died as oxygen supply was snapped for some time on October 15, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) Vineet Chawdhry visited the IGMC to take stock of the situation. He has ordered an inquiry and constituted a committee headed by vice-principal Dr KP Chaudhary into the incident. Chawdhry, however, said though three deaths had taken place and there was also disruption in the oxygen supply, there was no link between the two incidents. He admitted that the oxygen supply had disrupted, but two patients died before this and one the next day. The death of the three patients – 16-year-old girl Reena from Soha village in Kullu, 57-year-old Sunder Lal hailing from Chopal of Shimla and four-day-old baby girl Saroj also from Chopal — is being linked to the snag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:21:56.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
