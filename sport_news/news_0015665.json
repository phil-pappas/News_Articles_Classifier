And after the match, Manuel Pellegrini had plenty of praise for his 20-year-old rising star, Sterling. \"Well, I think it was very important for him to score in this game three goals. It's important for him to improve his finishing - I think that he did it today. He's a very young player and I'm sure that he will continue improving in the future,\" said Manuel Pellegrini, Manchester City manager.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:39:16.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
