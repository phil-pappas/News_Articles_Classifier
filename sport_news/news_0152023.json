Daly, one of four seniors, helped guide the Panthers to their second consecutive Colonial Division championship in 2015. \n\"It's certainly been a successful season,\" head coach Nick Murphy said. \"Part of that is because we have more boys on the team than we've ever had. I think when you have numbers like that, you'll get some competition within the team and it really brings everybody up.\" \nThe boys squad has 22 members this season, while there have been as few as 10 in recent memory, according to Murphy. \nThe Panthers clinched the division Tuesday, Oct. 6 at Branch Brook Park. Murphy said he feels the team performed at an extremely high level with the division on the line. \n\"Everyone worked together as a team and it was a really good day,\" he said. \nMurphy recognized sophomore Pat Smurla and seniors Shane Daly, Nick DeGenarro and Jason Krasnow for their strong performances and improvement throughout the season. \n\"A lot of these kids have been making strides each week,\" Murphy said. \"They keep getting faster and faster.\" \nAfter clinching the division, the Panthers continued to perform well, as the team saw positive results at their most recent meet, the Greystone Invitational, Friday, Oct. 9 at Central Park in Morris County. Murphy said it was nice to see his team compete at a high level on the course, which will also be the host of a major cross-country event moving forward. \n\"We went there because our sectional championship is going to be there four weeks from now and it's a good opportunity for us to practice the course,\" Murphy said. \nMurphy was extremely pleased with DeGennaro's performance at Greystone. The senior won his varsity race, which pinned the top runners from a group of smaller-sized schools against each other. \n\"He's led the team through the whole season,\" Murphy said of DeGennaro. \"He's really a standout athlete. This is his first cross-country season. It used to be that he only ran track and field in the spring. He's really starting to break out and is turning some heads.\" \nAside from DeGennaro, Murphy said he has been thrilled with the results he has seen this season, his first as head coach of the cross-country teams. Murphy was not sure how they would do in 2015 due to a mostly inexperienced roster consisting of 13 underclassmen. \n\"We started out with only a couple kids with a lot of cross-country experience,\" Murphy said. \n\"I think that throughout the season, a lot of kids are not only getting in shape, but I think they're starting to get it and work together as a faster pack. We're starting to look pretty good together as a team now and I think that will transfer over to sectionals, which will be our biggest meet as a team.\" \nThe sectional meet, scheduled for Nov. 7, is something Murphy has had his eye on since the middle of the season. While he has tried to keep expectations in check, he let his team know he believes they are capable of going to the next level. \n\"I do expect that we move on through sectionals to the group meets as a team, which would actually be the first time since 1991 that the boys would have been to a group meet,\" Murphy said. \"It's rare for Cedar Grove to progress like that as a team. We have two boys that should be able to advance in Nick and Pat, so even if the team doesn't make it, they should advance.\" \nWhether the team advances through sectionals, Murphy believes the future may be bright for the Cedar Grove cross-country program. \nWith back-to-back division titles in hand, Murphy believes the Panthers may be placed in a new division that may present more challenges in 2016. \n\"I think we're ready to move to the next level and we'll probably see that,\" Murphy said. \n\"I think the boys are most likely going to move up to the Liberty Division, which is one division higher and has tougher competition. It says something about the culture that the team has created and where the program is.\" \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:57:49.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
