As great a player as Herrera can be, Van Gaal can indeed relegate him to the bench. Juan Mata is United’s Player of the Month for September (here’s more on that) , How valuable has Juan Mata been to United this year? \nWell, his 16 chances created are more than double any other United player. Mata has also either scored or assisted on more goals over the past five seasons than any other midfielder in the Premier League during that span. Still, he was left out of the starting XI at CSKA Moscow yesterday. Van Gaal revealed why. \n“I have to rotate. Mata has played almost every game. He needs a bit of a rest,” Van Gaal said. \nIt appears that Van Gaal was saving Mata, who has ascended to the team’s designated penalty kick taker role, for the upcoming Mancester Derby on Sunday. ( on a side note, Van Gaal also revealed why he dropped Memphis Depay and Daley Blind as well ) \nJuan Mata is someone who says all the right things for the team off the pitch, and does all the right things on it. He even writes a self-reflexive blog about the team. A leader and a gentleman, I’m sure he’s fine with this decision. He just said a couple days ago that he’s even fine with being deemed “a luxury player.” \nPaul M.
