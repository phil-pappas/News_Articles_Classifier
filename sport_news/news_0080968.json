Gillen, who is a fire fighter, made his pro debut in May this year with a points win over Shaun White and followed it up in September with another points win over Lewis van Poetsch. \nAs an amateur, Gillen's highlight was to win the 2013 World Police and Fire Fighter Games in Belfast where he knocked out all his opponents to claim the gold. \n\"I've watched him in the Olympics and in his pro-debut. He's a world class kid and I can't wait to get in there and put him to the test. He's an Olympian and that speaks for itself. He's a hero in his country and he's idolised by millions of people. I'm certainly no journeyman and I'm not going in to make up numbers, I'm here to fight and win,\" said the 33-year-old Gillen. \n\"I know the odds are stacked against me but when you're facing life risking tasks through your job then fighting someone like Singh is a walk in the park. I will be coming for him. I've got a strong jab and the reach to take advantage of him, backed up with a solid chin and a real desire and with nothing to lose. I'm going to be a really dangerous opponent for Singh.\" \nA Deputy Superintendent of Police in Haryana, Vijender is training in Manchester with coach Lee Beard as he aims to beat Gillen and stay on track to become India's first world pro boxing champion. \n\"I can't wait for this fight against Gillen. It looks like he will bring me a challenge in my second fight. From what I have seen of him, he looks like a good opponent who will push me and I hope he does because then the better I will fight. I rise to my opponent and it brings the best out in me,\" said the 2008 Olympic bronze medallist. \n\"He's got an unbeaten record, albeit two fights, and it's a big motivator for me to claim his first loss. If I can stop him, like against Whiting, then that will be another good win for me.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:24:16.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
