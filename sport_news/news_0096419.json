(AP) - NASCAR will make just one attempt to finish races under the green flag this weekend at Talladega Superspeedway. NASCAR currently gives three attempts at a green-white-checkered flag finish, even if it means adding additional laps to a race. But in cutting it down to one attempt, NASCAR is reducing the chance of accidents in the Sprint Cup Series and Truck Series races. The July race at Daytona was marred by a last-lap crash that sent Austin Dillon's car sailing into the fence. NASCAR chief racing development officer Steve O'Donnell says the procedural change to one attempt at a green-flag finish is an effort to balance \"exciting finishes and safety.\" (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
