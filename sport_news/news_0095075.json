Baylor ranked second in the polls this week just below number one Ohio State, while Texas Christian checked in at number four in the latest AP rankings. \nBaylor has been riding one of the most prolific offenses in decades to its number two overall ranking. The Bears have lit up scoreboards at a record pace this year. In six games, the Bears are averaging 63.8 points per game. \nComplicating the matter for defenses looking to slow down the Bears is that Baylor is doing it through the air and on the ground. Baylor is second in the nation in rushing offense, averaging 348.7 yards per game and is sixth in the nation in passing, averaging 371 yard per game. \nOverall, Baylor averages a stunning 8.9 yards per play and over 710 yards of offense…per game. \nStill, Baylor is about to run into the toughest part of its schedule in the next two months. The Bears mopped the floor with teams like Kansas, SMU, Lamar, Rice, and Texas Tech, but starting in November, business will pick up for Baylor. \nThe Bears play number 17 Oklahoma at home before traveling to Stillwater, Oklahoma to play the Oklahoma State Cowboys and following that game up with a likely shootout with the TCU Horned Frogs in Fort Worth. Baylor finishes the season at home with a game against the Texas Longhorns. \nThe Horned Frogs are no slouches when it comes to playing offense. TCU averages 50.1 points per game and mauled Texas a few weeks ago in Fort Worth. TCU’s problem this season isn’t on the offensive side of the ball, but instead on the defense. \nTCU has allowed at least 37 points in three games this season. The Horned Frogs needed a last second touchdown catch to avoid an upset at Texas Tech and only edged Kansas State by a touchdown 52,45 two weeks ago. Remember, this is the same Kansas State team that lost 55-0 over the weekend to Texas. \nTCU’s ranked sixty-ninth in the country in scoring defense, allowing 26.6 points per game. Overall, the Horned Frogs are ranked 74th in the nation in total defense, allowing just less than 400 yards per game this season, according to cfbstats.com. \nBaylor and TCU will meet on November 27 in what could be a battle for the Big XII Championship and a berth in the College Football Playoff.
