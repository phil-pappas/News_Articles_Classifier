Despite going into the half tied at 24-24, the Golden Bears scored 21 points in the third quarter to separate themselves from the Longhorns.\nHere are five thoughts from the Longhorns' loss\nMissed extra point ends\nBig plays gash Longhorns\nTexas' defense gave up big plays throughout its game with California.\nThe Longhorns gave up a 17-yard touchdown to wide receiver Kenny Lawler on a fourth down play. Late in the second quarter, the Longhorns gave up a 49-yard run to junior Khalfani Muhammad which set up an eventual Golden Bears' touchdown.\nTexas was burned by a 74-yard touchdown by Muhammad which pushed California's lead to 45-24.\nThe Longhorns defense continues to allow big plays. Texas' defense allowed [total yards here]. After three tough defensive outings, the unit's issues are a trend.\nTurnovers hurt Texas\nThe Longhorns held a 24-21 lead with 52 seconds left in the first half but California intercepted a pass to the Texas 30. The Longhorns prevented the Golden Bears from scoring a touchdown but they were able to tie the game with a 34-yard field goal.\nThe Longhorns opened the second half with another turnover on a fumble by Heard. California was able to capitalize on the Texas turnover with a touchdown to give it a 31-24 lead.\nTexas' mistakes cost it a chance to win against the Golden Bears.\nHeard continues to impress despite mistakes\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard made his second collegiate start against California. He continued to dazzle with his feet as he run for [YARDS HERE] and two touchdowns.\nHis running ability helped the Longhorns during long third down plays. His legs helped the Longhorns extend plays. He connected with senior wide receiver Daje Johnson on a 45 yard reception after the play broke down. Heard finished with [passing yards].\nDespite his two turnovers, he looked poised in the pocket and was able to take advantage of running lanes.\nTexas without its starting safeties\nJunior safety Dylan Haines was ejected on a targeting penalty. Haines was running down California wide receiver Stephen Anderson when he led with his helmet on the tackle.\nHaines led the Longhorns in 2014 in interceptions with four. He was replaced with junior safety Kevin Vaccaro. Vaccaro racked up nine tackles while replacing Haines.\nTexas also lost sophomore Jason Hall on an injury. He didn't return to the game. Hall was replaced by freshman defensive back P.J. Locke. Locke finished with four tackles.\nPenalties change game\nThe Longhorns were bailed out by penalties against the Golden Bears. Texas failed to secure a kickoff which California recovered inside Longhorn territory. But the play was negated because the Golden Bears were called for an offside penalty.\nTexas was also hurt by its own penalties. Haines' targeting penalty hurt the defense throughout the night. A holding call stalled one of the Longhorns drives. A personal foul penalty on a late-hit from senior offensive guard Sedrick Flowers caused Texas to go from third and manageable to third and 24.\nIn a game where the Longhorns couldn't afford to make mistakes, its penalties hurt it.\nMORE COVERAGE\nSherrington: 45-44 loss to Cal shows UT has lots to fix, but Strong has found a QB\nCarlton: Heard puts on a show, but ...
