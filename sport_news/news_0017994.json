It will be up to the Mahnomen County attorney to decide whether to file such a charge.\nThe incident happened over Labor Day weekend on Tulaby Lake in northwestern Minnesota.\nThe suspect told authorities that he had been fishing about 8 a.m. and noticed something swimming but wasn’t sure what it was, according to the DNR report. He drove the pontoon out to investigate, he told the DNR official, and when he got near the deer it began swimming farther out into the lake. He drove between the deer and shore while trying to get around the front of it to turn it around, he said, and stayed 50 yards from the deer.\nA resident on the lake who witnessed the events gave an account that began in a similar way, according to the DNR report, but the witness said the pontoon at one point circled the deer and prevented it from heading toward the public landing, and that it seemed like the pontoon sped up and was following behind the deer.\nThe witness said he’d never seen a deer swim that fast and got in his own pontoon to confront the driver, but when he got out on the water the deer was floating belly up. The DNR is investigating the death of a deer on Tulaby Lake. Lake association members say it died of exhaustion after a pontoon driver harassed it.\nThe suspect had told the witness that he was trying to see what it was and told the witness “what do you think I am a deer killer,” the witness said, according to the DNR report.\nThe Mahnomen County attorney couldn’t be reached Wednesday for comment.\nStar Tribune staff writer Paul Walsh contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144297628662543.jpg?w=263"], "published": "2015-10-01T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:59:51.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
