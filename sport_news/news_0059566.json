Holloman (11) recovers a fumble during the first half of the Gamecocks' victory over Vanderbilt. (AP Photo/Richard Shiro) × COLUMBIA — South Carolina doesn’t aim just to play better under interim head coach Shawn Elliott. The Gamecocks want to play faster as well. That much was evident in Saturday’s 19-10 victory over Vanderbilt, the first for USC since Steve Spurrier stepped down in the wake of his worst opening half to a season at South Carolina. The Gamecocks pushed the tempo, particularly in the first half with new offensive coordinator G.A. Mangus calling the plays, and rolled up a season-high 424 yards in the process. Continued problems in the red zone — the Gamecocks settled for field goal attempts six times Saturday, converting four of them — prevented USC from scoring more points. But the offense often moved well between the 20s, in large part because South Carolina went with an up-tempo approach that Elliott hopes to use more of in the future. “We were making an effort to push it. We were making an effort. And I think we will make a better effort,” Elliott said. “I think that’s one of the things that we have to improve on. As you practice that more, you get a little bit more comfortable with it offensively. I think our players will become more confident in doing that as well.” They certainly seemed to embrace it against Vanderbilt. Although the scoreboard didn’t reflect it, Perry Orth had his best game at quarterback, completing 17 of 28 attempts for 272 yards, while Brandon Wilds rushed for 119 and Pharoh Cooper caught seven passes for 160 and a touchdown. “I think it can be really good. It was awesome,” Orth said. “We moved the ball up and down the field. We stalled out a few times in the red zone, but we put up some good yards, we were going back and forth. We just couldn’t punch it in, but that will come. I think everybody on our offense enjoys the upbeat pace. You don’t have to think. You just go out and play.” Holloman ejected South Carolina lost T.J. Holloman in the second quarter when the starting linebacker was ejected for what officials deemed a helmet-to-helmet hit on Vanderbilt receiver Kris Kentera. Holloman broke up a third-down pass that appeared to stop the Commodores at the USC 7, but the penalty gave Vanderbilt a new set of downs which produced its lone touchdown of the game. “It’s always a tough call. It’s a judgment call,” said USC co-defensive coordinator Jon Hoke. “And the receiver was going down, so I don’t know how exactly you say … it was a tough call. It’s a judgment call. He made the call. I’m not going to argue with it. I’m not going to change the call by arguing with it.” With Holloman out, the Gamecocks turned to sophomore Bryson Allen-Williams, who responded with a huge stop of Vanderbilt tailback Ralph Webb on third-and-short near the goal line, and then an interception on the Commodores’ next possession. “Coach Hoke preached takeaways, so I was just thankful for the opportunity to get out there,” Allen-Williams said. Fellow linebacker Skai Moore “came to me and said, ‘Here is your chance to go make a play.’ So, I tried to make one.” Brandon’s back Wilds returned Saturday after missing three games with bruised ribs suffered Sept. 19 at Georgia. His 119-yard effort marked the just the second triple-digit output by a USC running back this season, following his 106-yard performance against Kentucky on Sept. 12. “Brandon coming back, he was determined,” Elliott said. “I tried to (tell) him, ‘This team needs you. It needs strong leadership.’ He was very, very important and critical to our win.” Spurrier said after last Saturday’s loss at LSU that Wilds held himself out despite being cleared by doctors. “I really wasn’t comfortable paying last week, because of my injury,” Wilds said. “This week, I was ready. The doctor told me six weeks. Last week was week three, this is week four.” And he knew right away Elliott would challenge him. “The day after he became the head coach, the first thing we did was put the ball on the 1-yard line and just run iso,” he said. “Pretty much a whole segment of practice. That’s pretty much my key of, were going to run the ball. It was a great feeling.” Back in black USC’s all-black uniforms Saturday were a surprise even to players. “I think the uniform was garnet on garnet. That’s what we heard, and then we walked into the locker room and saw black jerseys,” Cooper said. “That turned the energy up in the locker room pregame, and we just took it onto the field.” The change was Elliott’s idea. “We just wanted something to kind of make it our own,” he said. “Our team had said all week, what about changing up our routine a little bit adding something different with our jerseys.” Elliott added he was unaware that the Gamecocks had lost several recent games in black uniforms, most recently an overtime setback last season to Tennessee. Saturday marked USC’s first victory in black jerseys or pants since a 7-3 win over North Carolina State to open the 2009 campaign. Extra points — True freshman Zack Bailey of Summerville started at center Saturday because Alan Knott was suspended for the first half due to an undisclosed reason. It was the third career start for Bailey, who had started against Central Florida and Missouri while Knott was out with a sprained ankle.. — South Carolina starting cornerback Rico McWilliams left the game in the third quarter with a concussion, and did not return. McWilliams also suffered a concussion late last season, which caused him to miss the Clemson game.
