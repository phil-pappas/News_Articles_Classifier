(AP) - Triple Crown champion American Pharoah completed a seven-furlong workout at Santa Anita as he continues to prepare for his final career start in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Oct. 31 at Keeneland. \nThe 3-year-old colt was timed in 1:23 flat for the distance with jockey Martin Garcia aboard on Wednesday under the watchful eye of trainer Bob Baffert. It was American Pharoah's fifth drill since returning to his home base last month and was in stark contrast to his leisurely five-furlong work of 1:01.20 last week. \nBaffert says he wanted to get a strong work out of American Pharoah and he handled it well. Stablemate Madam Aamoura provided a target for the colt, who started about seven lengths behind her before charging past the filly. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
