(AP) — Greg Ward Jr. threw for 273 yards and ran for 182 yards with three touchdowns, breaking the school record for rushing yards by a quarterback, to help lead Houston to a 38-24 victory over Tulsa on Saturday. \nKenneth Farrow finished with 159 yards on 19 carries with two touchdowns, including a 44-yarder for the Houston (4-0, 1-0 American Conference). \nAll three of Ward’s touchdown runs came in the first half, helping Houston to a 21-10 lead at the break. A Zack Langer 1-yard TD run for Tulsa late in the third cut the Cougars lead to seven (24-17) after three quarters. But the Golden Hurricanes (2-2, 0-1) got no closer, as Farrow added both of his TD’s in the fourth to push the game out of reach. \nDane Evans finished with 326 yards passing for Tulsa. Langer added 62 yards rushing and three TD’s. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:13:49.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
