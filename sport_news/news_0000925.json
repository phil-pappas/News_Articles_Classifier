Thompson rejected a one-year, $6.9 million qualifying offer from the Cavs and appeared ready to hold out into the regular season. \nThompson averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds off the bench for the Cavs last season but started 15 games during the playoffs after Kevin Love was sidelined with a shoulder injury and averaged 9.6 points and 10.8 rebounds during Cleveland's run to the NBA Finals. \nThe signing could be made official Thursday.
