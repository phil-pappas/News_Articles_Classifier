From the start, it’s been about the players in his locker room – getting the most out of them and getting them to believe that they can win.\n\"The goal coming in is to maximize the group we have and, to me, the outside opinion is what it is.\" Hynes said Friday. \"Everyone has a right to it but, as a coach, it’s about your players and trying to find a way to get these guys to play their best hockey and we still have a long way to go.\"\nStill, Hynes could not have asked for a better reinforcement of what he’s been preaching than the three-game winning streak and 3-0-1 surge his team carries into tonight’s game in Buffalo. Because, as much as Hynes and the players talked about making progress while they were losing their first three games, that kind of talk starts to ring hollow if positive results don’t soon follow.\n\"You might lose games and not play well. Then, you’re not going in the right direction,\" Hynes said. \"But, we felt like we were going in the right direction and that was really important, as important as winning. Now that you’ve played well and made some progress, the fact that we’ve been able to win games, that’s always a better feeling than losing.\"\nHynes recalled Friday how his team sagged after it fell behind by two goals in its 3-1 season-opening loss to Winnipeg on Oct. 9.\nThat was in sharp contrast to the attitude of his players when they fell behind, 4-2, in the third period Thursday night in Ottawa.\nAlthough they weren’t playing particularly well, there was still a belief they could find a way to win that game and they did, scoring twice in the final 5:50 of regulation to tie it before pulling out a 5-4 shootout victory.\n\"It wasn’t our best game at both ends of the rink, but we found a way,\" goaltender Cory Schneider said. \"It just goes to show us that if we do play the way we’re capable of and we know we can that, hopefully, it will be better results or a little bit easier than it was [Thursday].\"\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:23.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
