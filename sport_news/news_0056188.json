(AP) - The Houston Astros beat the Kansas City Royals at their own game Thursday night, relying on sharp pitching from Collin McHugh and stingy defense behind him for a 5-2 victory in the opener of their AL Division Series. \nMcHugh (1-0) allowed four hits, including a pair of solo homers by Kendrys Morales, while pitching around a 49-minute rain delay. The right-hander lasted six innings before turning the game over to his bullpen, which scattered just three runners over the final three frames. \nTony Sipp, Will Harris and Oliver Perez got the game to Luke Gregerson, part of Oakland's wild-card collapse in Kansas City last year. He handled the ninth to earn the save. \nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros, but they also scored via the same sort of small ball the Royals used in reaching the World Series last season. \nRANGERS-BLUE JAYS \nChirinos 2-run homer leads Rangers over Blue Jays 5-3 \nTORONTO (AP) - Robinson Chirinos hit a two-run homer against David Price, Rougned Odor had a solo shot and the Texas Rangers beat the Blue Jays 5-3 Thursday in an AL Division Series opener as postseason baseball returned to Toronto for the first time in 22 years. \nBoth starting third baseman left with injuries: Texas' Adrian Beltre in the third with a sore lower back and Toronto's Josh Donaldson in the fifth after he was kneed in the head while sliding in an attempt to break up a double play. \nYovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings, improving to 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against Toronto. Keone Kela, Jake Diekman and Sam Dyson finished, with Dyson getting a save. \nPitching on 11 days' rest, Price (0-1) allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He dropped to 1-6 with a 4.79 ERA in 11 postseason games, including six starts. \nCOLTS-TEXANS \nJohnson has 2 TD receptions, leads Colts over Texans 27-20 \nHOUSTON (AP) - Andre Johnson had two touchdown catches against his former team to help the Indianapolis Colts beat the Houston Texans 27-20 on Thursday night. \nJohnson, who spent his first 12 NFL seasons in Houston before he was released in March, pushed the lead to 27-17 with a 2-yard touchdown reception from Matt Hasselbeck in the fourth quarter. Johnson finished with six catches for 77 yards. \nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games. \nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left. \nThe 40-year-old Hasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck may not have been 100 percent either, after missing practice Tuesday with an illness. \nSMU-HOUSTON \nWard, Farrow lead Houston past SMU 49-28 \nHOUSTON (AP) - Gary Ward Jr. ran for four touchdowns and Kenneth Farrow ran for three as Houston defeated SMU 49-28 on Thursday night. \nWard, who completed 16 of 18 passes for 243 yards, led the Cougars (5-0, 2-0 American Conference) with 82 yards on 14 carries, finding the end zone once in each quarter. \nWard has rushed for 11 touchdowns and passed for eight this season but his 82 yards on the ground is his lowest output of the season. \nMatt Davis completed 21 of 35 passes for 238 yards and three touchdowns for the Mustangs (1-5, 0-2), who led 14-7 after one quarter. Courtland Sutton and Ryheem Malone had the touchdowns. \nFarrow scored twice and Ward capped the second quarter with a 2-yard TD run with two seconds left to help the Cougars take a 28-21 lead at the half. \nDavis' third TD was a 25-yarder to Darius Joseph with 3:35 to play. \nSPURS-KINGS \nKings beat San Antonio in Aldridge's Spurs debut \nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Rudy Gay had 26 points and seven rebounds as the Sacramento Kings beat the San Antonio Spurs 95-92 in a preseason game Thursday night. \nThe Spurs played without Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, who didn't make the trip. Nor did Boris Diaw or coach Gregg Popovich. Assistant Ettore Messina ran the Spurs in their preseason opener. \nDeMarcus Cousins had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings. \nLaMarcus Aldridge shot 3 for 10 and finished with eight points and three rebounds in his Spurs debut. Newcomer David West had five points in 23 minutes. Kawhi Leonard scored 16 points and Kyle Anderson had 15. \nRajon Rondo had 10 assists, eight points and eight rebounds. Marco Belinelli, who played with the Spurs last season, had 10 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter. \nPENGUINS-STARS \nNiemi, Stars shut out Penguins 3-0 in season opener \nDALLAS (AP) - Antti Niemi recorded his 33rd career shutout and assisted on two goals in his Dallas debut, as the Stars beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-0 on Thursday night in the season opener for both. \nAles Hemsky had a power-play goal and an assist. \nRookie Matthias Janmark scored on his first shot on his first shift in an NHL game to make it 1-0. The Stars acquired Niemi and Janmark in trades earlier this year. \nDallas scored on two of five power plays. Jamie Benn, the NHL's leading scorer last season, had a power-play goal in the third period. \nNiemi made 37 saves to improve his career record against the Penguins to 5-1-1. He withstood a flurry in the final minute after Pittsburgh pulled goalie Marc-Andre Fleury for an extra skater. \nFleury had 21 saves. \nTEXANS-FOSTER \nTexans' Foster returns after leaving with injury \nHOUSTON (AP) - Houston running back Arian Foster has returned after leaving in the second quarter against Indianapolis with an unspecified injury. \nFoster was injured Thursday night on a hard hit with about 4 minutes left in the second quarter. He remained on the field for a couple of minutes while trainers looked at him before walking off the field. He came back in two plays later and carried the ball for no gain before going to the locker room. \nHe was back on the field for Houston's first drive of the second half. \nIt was Foster's second game this season after he missed Houston's first three games after groin surgery. \nT25-OKLAHOMA-TEXAS-WAGER \nTexas, Oklahoma governors wager barbecue for homeless \nDALLAS (AP) - Somebody is going to get some barbecue, but who gets it will be decided by the outcome of Saturday's annual Red River Rivalry game between Texas and Oklahoma in Dallas. \nTexas Governor Greg Abbott and Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin have made the two state's traditional wager over the outcome. \nA statement from Abbott's office says a Texas win would mean Fallin and Head Country Bar-B-Q in Oklahoma City will sponsor 600 meals to be served at Austin's Capital Area Food Bank. An OU win would mean Abbott will send a shipment of meals from Railhead BBQ in Fort Worth to the City Rescue Mission, an Oklahoma City nonprofit partnering with the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. \nRANGERS-BELTRE \nRangers' Beltre leaves playoff game with stiff back \nTORONTO (AP) - Texas Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre left Thursday's AL Division Series opener against the Toronto Blue Jays in the third inning after hurting his back on a slide. \nBeltre could hardly run to first base after hitting an RBI single in the top half of the inning, and received attention from the trainer at first base. \nAfter Prince Fielder's inning-ending groundout, Beltre tried jogging to his position at third base but came out of the game, in obvious pain. Beltre appeared to be wiping away tears as he was helped off the field and into the dugout. He was replaced by Hanser Alberto. \nRangers spokesman John Blake said Beltre had lower back stiffness caused by a slide into second base as Prince Fielder hit into an inning-ending double play in the first. \nBeltre hit .287 with 18 homers and 87 RBIs this season. His two-out single in the third gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead over David Price and the Blue Jays. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
