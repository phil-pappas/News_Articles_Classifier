The Bears, who beat the Chiefs 18-17 on Sunday without six players who started at least one game this season — including wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal, left tackle Jermon Bushrod and safety Antrel Rolle — lost two more contributors when Shea McClellin and backup running back Jacquizz Rodgers suffered injuries in the comeback victory.\nRodgers is on injured reserve after suffering a broken arm on a punt return against the Chiefs. Coach John Fox wouldn’t divulge McClellin’s condition, but it’s a knee injury. Even if he’s day-to-day, with the Bears under Fox that’s the same as “out indefinitely.”\nWill it ever end? Fox thinks it’s just a “bug” that will run its course. “It comes in waves, just like turnovers,” he said. “Hopefully it thins out moving forward.”\nDon’t be surprised if it does. One theory about the Bears’ spate of injuries is that Fox’s physical training camp regimen is a shock to the system that leaves players susceptible to injuries. Once players are conditioned to the physicality, the injuries abate.\nIn Fox’s first season in Denver in 2011, the Broncos lost several key players early in the season, including Elvis Dumervil, Champ Bailey, Royal, Demaryius Thomas, Marcus Thomas, D.J. Williams and Willis McGahee. But they were all there in the second half when the Broncos made a playoff run with Tim Tebow at quarterback.\nThe injury reports then weren’t as ugly as the Bears’ last week — when 16 players were listed, 15 of them questionable, doubtful or out. But the Broncos had fewer injured players as the season ensued. Through the first five games in 2011, the Broncos listed 16 players as out and 13 as questionable. In the final 11 games, only three players were out and 15 questionable.\nIt’s only a theory, of course. But with the progress the Bears have made under Fox despite all the injuries, the Bears’ first-year coach has earned the benefit of the doubt.\n2. While injuries to rookie Kevin White (stress fracture) and Jeffery (calf, hamstring) have been frustrating, cornerback Tracy Porter’s productive play in the last two games has been promising. Porter was a forgotten man when he missed most of training camp with a hamstring injury. He played just seven snaps in the preseason. But he’s been a playmaker the past two weeks.\n3. Speaking of injuries, is there any football team that doesn’t abide by the “next-man-up” philosophy? Are there any teams out there that lose a player and says, “We’re not going to fill that spot. We’ll just leave it open and hope for the best?”\n4. Addition by subtraction? Jared Allen’s departure seems to have enhanced linebacker Pernell McPhee’s role as a team leader. With Allen in Carolina, the effusive McPhee clearly is the emotional bellwether of the defense. With all due respect to Allen — a future Hall of Famer — it always helps when that guy is as productive as McPhee has been the last three games.\nIt was no surprise that when Kyle Long was asked about leadership and what he looks for in a leader, he used McPhee as his example.\n“I came to the sideline yesterday and we were down 17-3,” Long said. “He [McPhee] grabbed me and looked me in my eyes, he’s like, ‘We gonna get this ball back. You just get your boys ready.’ I was like, ‘You heard the man. Get ready guys. Stay loose. Pernell is going to get the ball back.’ And sure enough [he did].”\n5. One trait of a winning team is that it makes its mistakes early. Jay Cutler’s sack/fumble that led to the Chiefs’ first touchdown came on the Bears’ second possession of the game. The Bears committed four penalties in the first 26 plays. They committed four penalties in the final 140 plays — including none on the two touchdown drives in the fourth quarter.\n6. It’s silly to fret about the Bears’ looking like they’ll fall out of contention for the No. 1 draft pick, or even a top-three pick. Their back-to-back victories over the Raiders and Chiefs — while not quite like beating the Packers and Seahawks — are a sign of real progress. These aren’t hollow late-season victories that drop the Bears out of a prime draft pick. The Bears are getting better — that’s the most important aspect of this season.\n7. And regardless of where they draft in 2016, the Bears will in effect be adding the No. 7 overall pick in wide receiver Kevin White. It’s more likely than not that White will miss the entire season — though in the unlikely event of a playoff run it could make for an interesting decision by Ryan Pace and John Fox in the second half of the season.\n8. Jared Goff Update: On the biggest stage of the season, the Cal junior quarterback threw five interceptions in a 30-24 loss to unbeaten and fifth-ranked Utah on Saturday night in Salt Lake City. Goff finished 25-of-47 for 340 yards and two touchdowns and a season-low 106.7 rating. He was under pressure all night against a stout Utah team that was coming off a bye — but was still standing at the end. In fact, Goff had a chance to win in the final minute but threw back-to-back incompletions from the Utah 21.\nGoff, who has been compared to Aaron Rodgers, Matt Ryan and the late, great Joe Roth, is 150-of-225 (66.7 percent) for 1,970 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions in six games for a 157.2 rating.\n9. Ex-Bears Player of the Week (also known as the “Josh McCown Award: Browns quarterback Josh McCown was 36-of-51 for a career-high 457 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions for a 111.3 rating in leading the Browns to a 33-30 overtime victory against the Ravens in Baltimore.\nMcCown has won starts with 100-plus passer ratings for five NFL teams — the Bears, Cardinals, Raiders, Buccaneers and Browns\n10. It’s early, but … The Bears are fourth in the NFL in total defense (304.6 yards per game) and third in pass defense (185.8) — they were 17th in both categories after five games last season and finished 30th and 31st. … Matt Forte leads the NFL in rushing (438 yards on 102 carries, 4.3 avg., 87.6 per game, 1 touchdown), though the Vikings’ Adrian Peterson has a higher per-game average (93.0). … Forte’s 102 carries leads the NFL. … Only six NFC teams have a better record than the Bears (2-3), but because the Bears are 0-3 in conference games they are 13th in the current playoff order. … The Bears are 0-5 on coin-flips this season. … Jay Cutler’s 18-yard pass play to Matt Forte on third-and-18 that led to Robbie Gould’s 44-yard field goal in the first quarter tied the Bears’ longest third-down conversion in Cutler’s seven seasons in Chicago. The last conversion longer than that was Kyle Orton’s 32-yard pass play to Garrett Wolfe on third-and-27 in 33-25 victory over the Saints in 2007.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:37:27.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
