The Bend Whitewater Park gets heavy use from paddlers even as park and trail construction continue into the Summer of 2016.

The dam it replaced was impassable, and paddlers had pull out above or portage around to continue. The project creates three channels below the dam — a gentle waterway for tubers and stand-up paddle (SUP) boarders, a protected section for fish and wildlife habitat and a white water wave play area.\nThe Bend Whitewater Park gets heavy use from paddlers even as park and trail construction continue into the Summer of 2016.
