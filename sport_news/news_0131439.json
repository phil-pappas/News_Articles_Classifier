(AP) - Fabian Johnson was told to return to Germany by U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who was displeased the defender took himself out of last weekend’s 3-2 loss to Mexico in the 111th minute. \nSeventh minutes after Johnson was replaced by Brad Evans, Paul Aguilar scored the go-ahead goal for Mexico, which earned a berth in the 2017 Confederations Cup. \nSpeaking a day before the U.S. plays Costa Rica in an exhibition, Klinsmann said: “I had a very severe word with Fabian Johnson, and I sent him home today.” \n“He can rethink his approach about his team,” Klinsmann said. \nJohnson, the starting right back for the U.S., plays for Borussia Moenchengladbach. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:45:33.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
