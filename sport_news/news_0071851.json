The average household size is 2.5 people. Ponder for a moment how much transpires within a typical American home about which the typical American adult has no idea. \nYour kids smoke dope, engage in sex, watch porn, hide guns and plot all manner of devious behavior within your home or apartment and you have no clue. A concerned, thoughtful parent ferrets out roughly 30 percent of the bullshit a kid pulls. Your spouse or roommate conducts activities you are unaware of within those same walls. \nBut let’s pretend Rick Pitino had to know what transpired with his basketball players inside a dorm room miles away from his home. Let’s pretend all coaches can keep track of young people better than their own parents. \n“How could he not know?” asked prostitute Katina Powell at the conclusion of ESPN’s carefully crafted story about sex parties at the University of Louisville. \nThe answer to that question is really easy. Pitino is human. He has a family. There are competing demands on his time that take precedent over monitoring the sexual activity of young boys on a college campus. Parents can’t track the sexual activity of the one or two children that live in their own home. \nThe 42-year-old Powell preposterously argued that Pitino had to know about the stripper parties because his players, former players and assistant coaches are so loyal to him that they had to tell him. Loyalty in athletics works just the opposite. Loyalty would make them keep Pitino in the dark. I do not blame her for being clueless about sports culture. She is, judging by the ESPN story, something far worse than a prostitute. She’s a mother who enlisted her three young daughters into the oldest profession and is now using their $100 encounters to sell a book. \nDid Rick Pitino know what was going on at that Louisville dorm? Our only source isn’t reliable. \nI told y’all earlier this week I’m no moralist. That lack of morality applies here. I’ve organized too many bachelor parties, been friends with too many strippers and spent way too much time in Vegas to jump on some sexual high horse. A high horse couldn’t hold my fat ass. \nThe objection here relates to fairness. A mother introducing her kids to prostitution strikes me as unfair. Convincing those same kids to publicly brand themselves as hos seems highly unfair. Using Katina Powell’s obvious greed and unconfirmed assumptions to bring down Pitino is absurdly unfair. \nPlease, let’s stop with the “Rick Pitino had to know” meme. And let’s stop with the “Rick Pitino must be fired” meme, too. \nBased on what we know at the moment, two people need to go away: 1. Katina Powell; 2. Andre McGee. \nMcGee’s foolishness is somewhat understandable. When this started, he was a graduate assistant living in the dorms with the players. He was the typical college kid doing what a lot of college kids do. Yes, he should’ve understood his position as a junior member of the basketball staff. No doubt. But the reality is, he acted like a 24-year-old transitioning from athlete to adult supervisor. He handled the transition poorly. Many athletes – many people – do. \nAfter my parents divorced, my mother did a phenomenal job raising me and my brother. She once went on a five-day vacation and left us in the care of a male cousin we idolized. I was probably 12 years old. First time I ever smoked weed in my life. My cousin rolled the joint. He also invited some of his friends over. They used cocaine. It’s the only time in 48 years of a very sordid life that I’ve ever seen cocaine. \nMy mother had no clue about any of this until I told her a couple of years ago. \nYoung people are foolish. You ever see the movie Porky’s? It’s a flick about high school kids trying to get laid at an infamous strip club after their plan to hire a hooker ended with them running through the woods naked. \nWhat allegedly happened at Louisville among the basketball players isn’t all that unusual. A childish basketball coach allegedly spent a very small amount of money over four years (strippers in major cities are laughing hysterically at $100 “side deals”) entertaining young men in the oldest fashion possible. If true, McGee, now an assistant coach at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, should apologize and be forced to leave college basketball. \nFormer Louisville standout Russ Smith (right) is one of the players mentioned in Katina Powell’s string of allegations. \nThe real story here is Katina Powell. Why isn’t the focus on her motivation? Why are her half-baked theories on what Pitino knew credible? Why is the worst person in all of this receiving the least amount of scrutiny? \nThese basketball recruits were high school kids. Powell was between the ages of 38 and 41 during her sordid tale. She was inside the dorm room. Pitino was likely at home in bed. Until there’s strong proof connecting Pitino to these parties, I say Powell is the real story here. \nWhy repeat the mistake of the Duke lacrosse case? The Duke lacrosse coach was fired for no reason, dismissed out of the need to be politically correct and smart on the public-relations front. \nRandy Shannon, the Miami football coach at the time Nevin Shapiro told salacious stories about escorts and college athletes, wasn’t held responsible for the alleged sexual behavior of his players. Why Pitino? \nPhoto credits: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images (top); Andy Lyons/Getty Images (bottom)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:11:00.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
