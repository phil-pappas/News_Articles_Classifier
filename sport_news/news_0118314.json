On Sept. 22, a student told a teacher “I have a plan for everyone at the school.” On Oct. 5, a bus driver overheard the student tell another student, “You will die. I’m going to kill you,” according to a report from the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators have taken the threats under evaluation to determine whether the incident is a criminal matter. Winfield said involving law enforcement sends a strong message to students. The officer will meet with the student, staff, and often parents to discuss the consequences of the student’s actions. “If the student has been mean-spirited or threatening in any way we typically ask for law enforcement to come and be part of that conversation with the family.” “You can’t even kid around like that, and usually an officer will use examples of other cases they feel are pertinent to show you just can’t say that.” Winfield said law enforcement was called three weeks ago when an argument between two students about video games got out of hand. “It’s not that we need them to haul these kids off,” he added. Sheriff’s Deputy Rob Lyons described the student reported Thursday as a pre-teen with a history of behavioral issues who does not necessarily have a clear way of acting out his anger. Winfield said the statement is unfair and based off only one interaction with the student. Winfield said the student has issues of defiance and disruption that are typical of all junior high students, but does not have a long list of infractions. The meeting with law enforcement Thursday could lead to regular visits to a school counselor if the behavior continues, Winfield said.
