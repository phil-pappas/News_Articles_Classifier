The Thunderbirds are in a tie with Eastern Washington for first place in the Big Sky Conference standings. \nBOZEMAN — More often than not, turnover margin is the impetus of a football team’s gains. \nTake Montana State. The Bobcats have turned the ball over just four times all season — third-fewest in the FCS — and that’s one of the reasons they rank in the top three in the nation in total offense. \nBut on the flipside is their defense, which has forced just four takeaways. MSU’s impartial turnover margin is one of the reasons coach Rob Ash’s squad is .500 at 3-3 overall and 2-2 in the Big Sky Conference. \nMontana, meanwhile, has turned the ball over 12 times so far. The Grizzlies’ minus-3 turnover total isn’t doing their strong defense any favors. The offense of coach Bob Stitt hasn’t produced a 30-point showing in six weeks. Coming off a bye, UM also has a 3-3 record and is 2-1 in the league. \nAnd then there’s the case of Southern Utah. The Thunderbirds are No. 1 in the nation in turnover margin at plus-11. They are tied for the FCS lead with 13 interceptions. Like the Bobcats, SUU has given the ball away just four times. \nIs there any debate why the Thunderbirds (4-2, 3-0) have won four in a row and are smack dab in the thick of the Big Sky race? \nSouthern Utah has pitched two consecutive shutouts following a 44-0 blowout win over conference foe Sacramento State on Saturday. Before a bye the week prior, the Thunderbirds also beat Weber State by a 44-0 score, a game in which they picked off five passes. \n“Our coaches do a very good job of preparing us each week for our assignments,” safety Miles Killebrew was quoted after the Sac State win. “We don’t do anything out of the ordinary, we just have each other’s backs on defense and just do our assignments and the results show.” \nThe Thunderbirds’ defense has yet to surrender a touchdown through three conference games. And their offense is hot now, too. Against Sacramento State, quarterback Ammon Olsen threw for 421 yards and a school-record-tying five touchdowns. \nEntering its game this week against UC Davis, Southern Utah is tied for first place in the Big Sky with Eastern Washington (4-2, 3-0), which keeps winning despite breaking even on the turnover ledger and having the lowest-ranked defense in the league. \nSouthern Utah has a tough road ahead, though, with home games against Cal Poly and Northern Arizona and trips to Montana State and Portland State still on the docket. \nAnd despite its success, it still don’t have many believers: SUU was again left out of the latest STATS FCS Top 25 poll while receiving just 113 votes. \nRegarding turnovers … \nWeber State linebacker Emmett Tela was responsible for two takeaways to help produce a 25-24 come-from-behind victory over North Dakota on Saturday. \nTrailing 24-19, Tela forced a fumble from UND quarterback Ryan Bartels, picked it up and ran 20 yards to the 10-yard line. Two plays later, Wildcats quarterback Jadrian Clark threw a short touchdown pass to take the lead. \nAfter North Dakota recovered a fumble on Weber State’s next drive, Tela intercepted Bartles near midfield to snuff out another comeback attempt. \nOn Monday, Tela was named the Big Sky’s defensive player of the week. \nJonesing for respect \nPortland State’s defense has been impressive so far, also. The Vikings are plus-9 in turnovers and reside near the top of the standings at 5-1 overall and 2-1 in the league. \nBut their offense took center stage on Saturday in a 59-42 victory over Montana State. If Vikings running back David Jones was inconspicuous beforehand, he’s well-known now. \nJones rushed for 285 yards on 23 carries — an average of 12.4 per rush — and scored three touchdowns. It was the fifth-best individual rushing day in PSU history. \nJones, a 6-foot-1, 205-pound senior, helped the Vikings establish a new single-game school record with 465 team rushing yards. On Monday, he was named the Big Sky’s offensive player of the week. \nJones vaulted himself to third in the league with 621 rushing yards despite carrying the ball only 68 times. Jones is averaging a Big Sky-best 9.1 yards per carry. \n100-yard dash \nAnother Jones — Montana State true freshman kickoff returner Logan Jones — made his first indelible impression in the Portland State game by returning a kick 100 yards for a touchdown. \nJones’ return came early in the third quarter. He was replacing Gunnar Brekke, who experienced concussion symptoms earlier in the game and was being held out. \nAccording to the Bobcats’ sports information office, Jones, a Kalispell Glacier product, is now one of five players in school history and one of three Big Sky players this season with a 100-yard return. Jones returned four kicks for 179 yards Saturday, the most by a player in a Big Sky game this season. \nPoll position \nWith its loss to Portland State, Montana State fell five spots to No. 21 in Monday’s STATS poll. Montana was idle last week but moved up one position to No. 19. \nPortland State continues to climb the ladder. The Vikings are now ranked No. 14, three spots higher than last week. \nEastern Washington, after a 45-28 victory over Idaho State slid ahead one place to No. 7. Taking over the Eagles’ previous ranking is North Dakota State (4-2), which was stunned by coach Joe Glenn and South Dakota 24-21 in the final seconds at the Fargodome. \nAside from NDSU’s slip-up, the poll’s upper echelon stayed relatively unchanged. No. 1 Jacksonville State (5-1), No. 2 Coastal Carolina (6-0), No. 3 Illinois State (5-1) and No. 4 James Madison (7-0) remained in the Top 5. \nThe only change was the addition of Chattanooga, which moved ahead one position to No. 5 after a 33-27 win over VMI. The Mocs (5-1) have won five in a row after a season-opening loss to Jacksonville State. \nAround the league \nEastern Washington’s Cooper Kupp was named the Big Sky’s special teams player of the week on Monday. The star WR caught two touchdowns and threw for another, but his 76-yard punt return for a TD in the third quarter helped the Eagles fend off Idaho State. … Northern Colorado is quietly 4-2 overall and 2-2 in the Big Sky after a 56-27 victory over UC Davis. The Bears scored eight touchdowns, a program record since moving to Division I. … Cal Poly continues to lead the FCS in rushing at 387.0 yards per game. The Mustangs host Portland State on Saturday. +2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:43:30.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
