We have already begun to put in place steps to ensure that this kind of tragic human error cannot occur again.\"\nA baby girl who was delivered prematurely on Sept. 14 was stillborn, and her twin brother lived for only an hour, WKRC-TV reported. Police said it's not clear exactly what happened to the boy's body, but it didn't make it to the hospital morgue and couldn't be found later, the station said.\nPolice told WKRC that when the family was making arrangements for handling the children's remains, the hospital located the body of one child but not the other.\nThe boy's remains also weren't found when a landfill was searched last weekend. A contractor hired by the hospital searched areas of the landfill where the hospital's waste was dumped, as well as trash from a laundry contractor, WKRC-TV reported.\nIt wasn't clear why the search occurred nearly two weeks after the infants' delivery or whether efforts to find the remains have ended. A hospital spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a message seeking more information Tuesday.\nUC Health called police for assistance last Wednesday, and investigators who talked with those involved concluded it was a civil matter between the family and the hospital, Cincinnati police spokeswoman Tiffaney Hardy said Tuesday.\n\"While this is a horrific thing that happened to this family and we feel for this family, our investigators concluded there was not technically a crime committed that we would investigate,\" Hardy said.\nShe said police weren't involved with the landfill search.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:23:57.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
