And being that Game 5 is an elimination game, the creator argues that Toronto can use all the help it can get.\"In 2015's regular season, the Blue Jays won 38 times and lost 14 when the dome was open,\" the petition reads. \"When it was closed, they won 11 and lost 14. Let's give them all the support we can and get the dome opened up for Wednesday!\"So far, the petition has over 22,000 signatures. It is directed at MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, since the league has the final say on whether or not the roof will be opened.Game 5 is scheduled to start at 4 p.m. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
