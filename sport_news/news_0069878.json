That is to say, Coe-Brown Northwood Academy will sweep the team titles and Oyster River will take the individual crowns with senior Maegan Doody and junior Patrick O’Brien. The Bears comfortably won Saturday’s team titles on their home course. The girls, led by Elisabeth Danis’s second-place finish in 18 minutes, 43 seconds, scored 36 points to 61 for second-place Bishop Guertin. Doody won the race in 18:20. Phillips Exeter (90), Hanover (97) and Oyster River (158) rounded out the top five girls teams. On the boys side, Coe-Brown scored 50 to beat out Oyster River’s 79. Kennett (148), Kingswood (150) and Phillips Exeter (152) rounded out the top five. O’Brien won the individual race in 16:22, 11 seconds ahead of Kingswood’s Hunter Miller. Both Coe-Brown teams effectively bounced back from subpar efforts at the Thetford (Vt.) Invitational the previous weekend. Danis, who recently verbally committed to attend the University of Alabama on scholarship, led a tight group that also included Brooke Laskowsky (19:38; 5), Alli Pratt (19:40; 6) and Julia Cormier (19:43; 7). With senior Meg Scannell — the de facto leader of the pack behind Danis, according to co-coach Tim Cox — out with an ankle sprain, sophomore Ahna McCusker filled the void nicely with a solid time of 20:19 to place 16th. “Without (Scannell), they needed to find themselves,” Cox said. “Today they did. They started to bend a little bit in the middle of the race, but they found each other again.” The duel between Doody and Danis, the top two runners in the state, eventually went to Doody, who was able to give herself some room after the mile and a half mark. “I wanted to go out and run my own race and see how I felt,” said Doody, the defending D-II champ and two-time Meet of Champions winner. “I’m happy Liz (Danis) was running with me and we pushed each other. That’s all I cared about.” Ditto for Danis. “I was really happy with my race,” Danis said. “I knew Maegan was going to take it out pretty hard. I was really excited to get pulled by her and see what I could do with her. It was really fun to race with her. Maegan had a really nice surge over the second half of the race.” O’Brien used an aggressive approach in the boys race, taking the lead early on and never surrendering it. “I went to the front, stayed there, ran my own race and kind of pushed the pace,” O’Brien said. “It worked out well. … This year I was really going for the win. Last year I was just trying to hang out in front. This year I kind of controlled the race early; whereas last year I hung off the back of the lead pack and made my move at the end.” Kingswood’s Miller is no stranger to racing O’Brien, and certainly was not unaccustomed to chasing the OR junior. “He takes a fast first mile and an even faster third mile,” Miller said. “So I figured I had to stay a little bit behind him for the first mile, and try to work up on him. But his third mile was just crazy.’ Coe-Brown had excellent team grouping, placing their five scoring runners in the top 16. Jared Nelson set the pace, finishing fourth in 16:42. He was followed by Evan Tanguay (16:55; 8), Davio DeLuca (16:59; 9), Zach Richards (17:23; 13) and River Groves (17:30; 16). Coe-Brown’s Cox said the best D-II boys runners were on hand Saturday and it gave the Bears a good chance to see where they stand. “We had a game plan for Oyster River and they executed it very, very well,” Cox said. “We wanted to go out with the front pack, but then really focus on the middle part of the race to try to supplant it, and they did that.” Other local runners placing in the top 20 were (girls) Phillip Exeter’s Yoshiko Lynch (19:50; 9), Christine Hu (19:51; 10), OR’s Danielle Slavin (19:51; 11), Coe-Brown’s Sarah Dupuis (20:28; 18), PEA’s Sarah Brown (20:32; 19); and (boys) OR’s Neville Caulfield (16:44; 5), PEA’s Garrett Pike (17:20; 11), Kingswood’s Owen Gwizdala (17:24; 14), C-B’s Tanner Richards (17:30; 17) and Kingswood’s Cameron Stinchfield (17:38; 18). Ellen Baker (22:18) and Sam Kelley-Derzon (22:27) were the leaders for the Portsmouth girls. Jack Reaney paced the boys in 19:06.
