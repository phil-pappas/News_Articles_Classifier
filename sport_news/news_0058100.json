Sources said police are avoiding immediate action against BJP leaders as it can escalate tension in Dadri.\nAware that any such move could add to the politically surcharged atmosphere, the UP government does not seem to be in a hurry to book the BJP leaders. DIG Meerut Ashutosh Kumar said action will be initiated against Union minister Mahesh Sharma, BJP MLA Sangeet Som and BSP leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui for violating Section 144 of CrPC. \"A challan report will be filed under Section 188 of the CrPC for these leaders for violation of prohibitory orders.\" They had visited Dadri after the attack. Earlier, SP (rural) Gautam Budh Nagar, Sanjay Singh, had also recommended action against these them.\nSenior police officers in Lucknow confirmed that probe is underway to establish if Dadri killing was a result of a conspiracy and who all were involved in it. \"Cops are collecting evidence about the exact sequence of events. We are looking into all possible aspects of the crime, including involvement of the accused and if there was any conspiracy that led to the murder,\" Kumar told TOI.\nSP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had on Thursday claimed that Dadri was a conspiracy hatched by three members of a particular party, who were also accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots.\nThe state government in its report to the Centre gave a clean chit to political leaders who visited Dadri, stating they had come to offer condolences to Akhlaq's family. The report also mentioned the visits of BJP leaders Mahesh Sharma and Sangeet Som but was silent on the purpose of visit.
