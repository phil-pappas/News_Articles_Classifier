James W. Williams, born in 1844 and died in Pueblo in 1921; Pvt. George Washington, born in 1838 and died in Pueblo in 1899; Cpl. Thomas Walker, whose birthdate is unknown and died in Pueblo in 1900; and 1st Lt. Louis Young, who was born in 1843 and died in Pueblo in 1901.\nThe stones were dedicated by members of the Buffalo Soldiers of the American West.\nR. Kenneth O'Neal, an Army veteran, honored the soldiers at a ceremony earlier this month, attended by about 100 people.\n\"Today, we set aside a moment to right a wrong and to honor four brave men as a profound gesture of our appreciation for their service to this country,\" O'Neal said.\nThe unmarked graves were discovered while putting together a presentation about the history of Roselawn, said Lucille Corsentino, founder of Concerned Citizens of Roselawn Cemetery.\nMore than 350 Civil War veterans are buried in the cemetery, The Pueblo Chieftain reported.\nWhile checking burial records, Corsentino said the number of graves didn't add up and four were missing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:07:48.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
