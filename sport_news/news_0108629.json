The boy told deputies he became scared and nervous, believing the pistol was a real firearm. When he got to Golden Meadow Upper Elementary School, he immediately told a teacher about the pistol and the bag was then turned over to school resource officers.\nInvestigators said the student did not know how the pistol got in his bag. The investigation is ongoing.\n“I cannot imagine the fear a nine-year-old would experience after finding a pistol in a school bag,” Sheriff Craig Webre said. “I commend this young man for overcoming his fear and doing the right thing. I also commend the actions of all those involved. While there was never any true danger, the situation was handled with the proper attention and respect.”\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
