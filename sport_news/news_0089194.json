No witnesses were brought before the judge to state they'd ended a contractual relationship because of the accusations.\n\"The court finds the evidence did not show a direct and immediate link required by law,\" Wery wrote. \"Damages of this nature cannot be awarded based on speculation and conjecture.\"\nLafleur has 30 days to decide whether to appeal. Contacted by The Canadian Press, his lawyer, Jacques Jeansonne, declined comment.\nTop ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-01T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:05:43.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
