(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) Sponsored Links The Associated Press GLASGOW, Scotland — \nThe U.S. women's gymnastics team dazzled during qualifying at the 2015 world championships Saturday, posting the top overall score to cement its status as heavy favorites for a repeat. \nThe group led by two-time defending all-around champion Simone Biles and reigning Olympic champion Gabrielle Douglas finished with a total 236.611, well ahead of second-place Russia to secure a spot in Tuesday's team final. \nBiles was nearly flawless on her way to 61.598, easily the best on a team filled with stars. Douglas advanced to the all-around finals with a 57.516. Three-time Olympic medalist Aly Raisman finished fourth in the all-around but will not compete in the finals because of rules limiting countries to two competitors in each event. \nThe U.S. opened with a dynamic series of floor routines that sent a message it is primed for a repeat.
