He collected 3,900 yards of total offense and 46 touchdowns, both records at Calvary Baptist, during his senior year. \n“He was an all-American guy,” Calvary head coach John Bachman said. “He was fun to be around. He was talented, smart as a whip and confident in who he was. He loved his family and loved his teammates. \n“It’s just hard to fathom.” \nFitzwater, who attended the Cavaliers' game against Union Parish on Friday night in Farmerville, was The Times’ All-City quarterback in 2012. He also lettered four years in basketball and once earned a triple-double with 38 points, 18 rebounds and 10 blocks. \nAt Copiah Lincoln Community College in Wesson, Mississippi, Fitzwater earned All-State honors twice. He was a member of the team that played in the 2014 championship. In two years at Copiah, Fitzwater amassed 44 touchdowns and 5,000 yards of total offense. He once threw for 500 yards against Itawamba. \nIn July of 2014, Fitzwater was invited to LSU. \n\"He visited with (LSU offensive coordinator) Cam Cameron for quite a while,\" Mike Fitzwater told The Times last November. \"At that time, they said they didn't have anymore scholarships, but said they would evaluate him at the send of (the 2014 season).\" \nThis story will be updated. \nTwitter: @RoyLangIII 15 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/college/2015/10/03/ulm-qb-daniel-fitzwater-calvary-product-dies/73290060/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:23:40.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
