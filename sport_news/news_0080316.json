Pahrump Valley Fire and Rescue Service arrived at 3:34 pm and Odom was stabilized and transported to Desert View Hospital arriving at 4:16 p.m.Dennis Hof talked with CNN: “Lamar Odom calls me on Saturday wanting to hang out for a few days to ‘have some fun’. I have a home attached to the Love Ranch and offered it up to Lamar. He was having a ‘good time’ at the Ranch and everything was great.“Again, Sunday everything was good but Lamar was a bit somber because people were calling and bothering him. To my knowledge, there were no drugs involved, Lamar was eating well and was just healthy. At 6aP Tuesday morning the 'girls' say goodbye to him because he seemed to be going to sleep. “Around 330pP Tuesday afternoon, two girls Ryder Cherry and Madison, go to check up on him and he's unconscious. They immediately call 911 and dispatch tells the girls to roll him over on his left side and starts to puke. He was totally unconscious. The girls and staff rush him out on the ambulance.“The police didn't find any illegal drugs on him. However, Dennis says he was taking A LOT of herbal Viagra. When they took him to the Pahrump hospital, the people there told us, “He doesn't look good. He doesn't look like he'll make it and if he does he won't be the same.”Nye County Sheriff’s Office Detectives Cory Fowles and Michael Eisenloffel arrived and conducted an investigation on scene. After being treated by the physicians, arrangements were made to transport him by Mercy Air helicopter.However, Odom was unable to be transported by air due to his stature, according to a news release from the Nye County Sheriff’s Office. He was immediately transported to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas for further treatment.Odom played 14 seasons in the NBA, most recently in 2012-13 for the Los Angeles Clippers.Odom was married to Khloe Kardashian for nearly six years. Their divorce was finalized three months ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:14:57.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
