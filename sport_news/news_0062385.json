Comment Cheboygan Daily Tribune - Cheboygan, MI Writer Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 9:45 PM Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 9:45 PM Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. SAULT STE. MARIE — It was another night of missed chances for the Cheboygan Chiefs, who suffered a 28-6 loss at Sault Ste. Marie on Friday night. The Chiefs had two golden opportunities to take the lead against the Blue Devils in the first half, but each time they couldn’t get the ball into the endzone due to turnovers, penalties or sacks. The best chance for the Chiefs came late in the first half as they marched the ball all the way down to the Sault Ste. Marie four-yard line. But following a five-yard too many men in the huddle penalty that made it third-and-goal from the nine, Cheboygan senior quarterback Zach Socha’s pass to senior receiver Dylan Shampine was intercepted by Tristan Johnson in the endzone, ending the drive for the Chiefs. After struggling all half offensively, the Blue Devils would march 98 yards down the field on the ensuing possession, capping it off with an 18-yard touchdown run from Ryan Jones with 34 seconds remaining in the half. The Blue Devils took a 7-0 lead into halftime. The Chiefs opened the contest by driving all the way inside the Blue Devils’ 20-yard line. However, Socha was sacked for a huge loss on a third down play. The Chiefs turned the ball over on downs on the very next play. Cheboygan’s defense started off strong in the third quarter, forcing a Sault Ste. Marie turnover that would give the Chiefs a chance to tie the game. However, the Chiefs once again couldn’t take advantage of the opportunity they had, going three-and-out on the possession. On the Sault’s next play from scrimmage, Nicholas LaCross scampered 55 yards to the Cheboygan five-yard line. Running back Justin Fountain then punched it in for a TD from one yard out to help the Blue Devils take a 14-0 lead with 7:35 left in the third quarter. After the Chiefs turned the ball over on downs on their next possession, the Blue Devils took advantage when LaCross hooked up with Jones on a 11-yard touchdown pass-and-catch. Another made PAT gave the Blue Devils a commanding 21-0 lead with 4:28 remaining in the third. The Blue Devils scored on their third consecutive possession when LaCross connected with Jones on a 13-yard TD pass to build a 28-0 advantage early in the fourth quarter. Despite the massive deficit, the Chiefs would not be shut out on this night as junior fullback Ethan Campeau capped off a 59-yard drive with a seven-yard TD run, making it a 28-6 contest with just over nine minutes left. Cheboygan finished with 236 total yards — including 170 yards rushing — in the loss. Dan Pearson led the Chiefs with 77 yards rushing on 10 carries, while Logan Mills carried eight times for 44 yards, and Campeau and Sidelinker finished with 27 and 13 rushing yards respectively. Page 2 of 2 - Socha finished the game 10-of-16 passing for 66 yards, while Mills caught two passes for 23 yards to lead Cheboygan’s receivers. Sidelinker led the Cheboygan defense with seven tackles, while Tristan Jarman and Campeau each had six, Dylan Socolovitch had five, Pearson (fumble recovery) had four, Mike Radle, Garrett Lindgren and Dalton Oikarinen each had three, Trent Brandau, Mills and Shampine each had two, and Ryan Dorey had one. LaCross finished with 125 yards rushing and 56 yards passing to lead Sault Ste. Marie, which finished with 253 total yards of offense. Cheboygan (1-5) will travel to Bay City John Glenn next Friday at 7 p.m. Meanwhile, Sault Ste. Marie (5-2) will travel up to Escanaba next Friday. With a win, the Blue Devils will clinch a playoff berth.
