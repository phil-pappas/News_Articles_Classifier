Watching the Tigers mob each other after getting the section title plaque made it obvious this was important to them. \n\"It means a lot, especially because Tech has been to state just once,\" senior captain Mohamud Aden said. \"We haven't won it and we want to change that this year.\" Buy Photo \nSt. Cloud Tech's Khalid Gelani (7) tangles with Rogers' Jacob Lehrke (10) in the first half Tuesday night, Oct. 20 at Husky Stadium. (Photo: Kimm Anderson, kanderson@stcloudtimes.com) \nThey'll get a chance after some worrisome early moments Tuesday. Rogers (15-2-1) scored first. \nTrevor Klink, a senior forward who is among the state's leading scorers, gave Rogers a 1-0 lead at 11:12. He booted in his goal by hitting the top of the cross bar from 25 yards out to goalkeeper Bryan Helminick's left off a pass from A.J. Wedell. \n\"Trevor's been fantastic for us all year,\" said Rogers head coach Chris Miller, who agreed that the regulation college soccer field on artificial turf gave Tech an advantage. \"We play on a lot smaller, grass field.\" \nThe goal by Klink, a talented and skilled player, shook up Aden. \n\"I was really scared,\" Aden said. \"I was very nervous. \n\"But I knew we'd come back. I knew we'd get another one.\" \nThe Tigers (16-1-2) tied it at 33:58. Mohamed Abdi scored the first of his two goals. Khalid Gelani passed the ball forward to Abdi, who caught it in traffic and kicked it home. \nTech then made it 2-1 when Abdi, the Tigers' leading scorer as a freshman, booted the ball in from the goalkeeper's left side right in front of the net. Jakob Alessio got the assist. \nAbdiqadar Farah scored in the second half for the Tigers on a header at 46:04. It come off a free kick. Woodman booted the ball high and in front of the net where Farah used his 6-foot-3 frame well, skying high and knocking the ball in with his head. \nWoodman said the Tigers had a different play on. Aden, however, saw the Royals were lined up to stop it. So, he changed the play. \nGood idea.

(Photo: Kimm Anderson, kanderson@stcloudtimes.com) \n\"I'm excited and I'm relieved,\" Tech head coach Nantha Viswanathan said. \"As I told the boys, this is just the beginning. \n\"We have three more games to go. I'm so proud of them. They played their hearts out and they deserved to win.\" \nTech was close last year. The Tigers lost to two teams last year, the eventual state Class 2A champion Anoka Tornadoes and the eventual state Class A champion St. Cloud Apollo Eagles. \nThey beat everyone else, but had no state berth to enjoy. That changed with the win over the Royals, who had 13 seniors and lost to only one team this season, Tech. \n\"Finally,\" Woodman said. \"Every year I've played here (at Tech), we've gotten a little bit further. \n\"It's nice to finally see it all pay off. In my four years here, I've been fortunate to be a part of some really high-skilled teams that won a lot of games. And now we get to see it pay off.\" \nTech out-shot Rogers, 16-9. Helminick had five saves. The Tigers had seven corner kicks to Rogers' one. Rogers had four of the six yellow cards, including three in the second half. \nThe Royals played a physical style, as they did the last time the teams' met. Tech won that one, 3-1. But this was an entirely different game. \nNeither Woodman nor Aden played in that one. Woodman had to take an ACT test. Aden was out with a twisted right knee that caused him to miss five games at midseason. \nAnd, Rogers was hit with two red cards in that game, meaning the Royals played two men down. \nIt was 11-on-11 all night on a beautiful fall Tuesday at Husky Stadium.

(Photo: Kimm Anderson, kanderson@stcloudtimes.com) \n\"It was a really good game,\" Aden said. \"We knew it was our year. \n\"This was our main goal, to go to state.\" \nTech will learn its state opponent after a coaches seeding meeting Saturday morning. The first-round state games are Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday next week with the semifinals and finals Nov. 2, 4 and 5 at St. Cloud State. \nViswanathan said he had no idea how the seeding would go. He also was fairly certain that Tech would not play its first-round state game in St. Cloud. The Tigers were likely headed to somewhere in the Twin Cities. \nIt was something to worry about later. Judging by all the smiles in the locker room afterward, getting to state was Tech's biggest hurdle and good news for Woodman's stomach. \nTom Elliott on Twitter @sctimestom or call 259-3661.
