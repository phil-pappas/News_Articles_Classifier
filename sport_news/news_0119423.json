I thought he moved or something. I never saw him again until January, when he assured me that he was coming out for track.” \nNow a senior and one of top distance runners in the nation, Jordan can make light of his lost freshman season. \n“I couldn’t hack it. I lasted one practice,” he said with a sheepish grin. \n“The truth is, I had gotten into golf that summer and team tryouts were coming up. I was at the stage of my life when I was just trying to be good at something and I thought golf was more fun. Through the course of the year (on the junior-varsity golf team) I learned I wasn’t any good, which turned out to be a good thing for my running career.” \nBuilding on a banner junior year in which he won a state indoor track title in the 3,200 meters, finished third in the state outdoor 3,200 and third in state cross country, Jordan has taken it to a new level this fall. He is unbeaten in seven races, posting winning margins of more than 30 seconds. \nOver the course of two weekends last month, Jordan broke 15 minutes for 5,000 meters twice, recording a state-record and U.S. season-leading mark of 14:44.7 at the Galion Invitational on Sept. 19. \nJordan is among a handful of Ohio high-school runners to break 15 minutes. Among them are former national champions Scott Fry of Sandusky Perkins (14:50.2 in 1984) and Bob Kennedy of Westerville North (14:59 in 1987), who excelled at Wisconsin and Indiana, respectively, and competed at the Olympic level. Fry holds the state-meet record, also 14:50.2. \nAlthough pleased with his performances, Jordan realizes that courses vary in difficulty (Galion is regarded as a fast course) and he ultimately will be judged by how he fares on Nov. 7 in the state meet at National Trail Raceway and, hopefully, the national championships on Dec. 12 in San Diego. \n“Of course, I look at times at the rankings, but in the grand scheme, they mean nothing,” he said. “The significant thing about Galion was that I broke Scott Fry’s meet record (14:49), and I know all about him because his name is all through the record books, and Coach Jarvis ran in that same race Fry set the record.” \nIt has been a steady improvement for Jordan, who placed 35th in the state meet as a sophomore (16:12.21) before taking third (15:40.04) a year ago. His track season concluded with him toying with the nine-minute mark for 3,200 meters before settling for third (9:09.83). He placed seventh in the New Balance Nationals (9:06.54). \nAt 5 feet 9, 115 pounds, Jordan is a wisp alongside most of his rivals. But he has nimble feet, excellent endurance and a keen command of pace. \n“When I got him his freshman track year, it was apparent he was going to be special,” Jarvis said. “He was running near 10 minutes for the 3,200 and you could tell there was more to come. He’s got a great work ethic, he is very disciplined and he feels the pace of a race very well. You trust him to make the right choices in races.” \nThat has been an especially helpful attribute during a season in which he has had little competition. \n“I know how to run out in front and hold a pace,” he said. “But at the same time, it probably would make it easier to have someone to push me, and that’s going to happen as the season gets deeper.” \nJordan committed recently to run collegiately at nationally ranked Iowa State, which also includes sophomore Toby Hardwick of Newark. \nsblackledge@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:19:10.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
