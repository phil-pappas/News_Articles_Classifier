Photo by Mike Weaver (Photo: Mike Weaver/Special to The Courier-Journal) \nLEXINGTON, Ky. – If Patrick Towles had checked his Twitter mentions before the fourth quarter of Saturday’s comeback against EKU, he may never have logged onto the social media account again. \nTowles deleted his social media accounts from his phone before the Florida game on Sept. 19. While he still has access to the accounts via the computer, Towles has not tweeted since Sept. 18. \nIf he had checked the mentions after Saturday’s game the most recent messages directed at him would have been dominated by congratulations for leading the comeback, but if he had scrolled down he would have had no trouble finding messages sent during the game from the opposite end of the spectrum. \n“@Patty_Ice14 is not our guy,” one fan tweeted. \n“One thing @Patty_Ice14 is awesome at is throwing behind his WRs,” another tweeted. \n“You’re a MAC level quarterback, @Patty_Ice14,” tweeted another account. UK's Williams ready to return to the field \nAnd those are just a sampling of the messages suitable for print that fans took the time to tag Towles’ personal account in to make sure he would notice when he logged onto Twitter. Complaints from everything about his hair to his habit of winking after touchdowns to his decision making on the field litter Towles’ Twitter mentions. \nTowles is no stranger to the spotlight. The grandson of former Major League Baseball All-Star and U.S. Rep. Jim Bunning, Towles has made headlines since leading Highlands High School to three consecutive state titles, but even he was not prepared for the scrutiny he’s faced this season. \n“You want to convince yourself you know what it’s going to be like and stuff like that, but you can’t,” Towles said. “It’s the most scrutinized position in sports, really, as a quarterback on any team. I’m always going to get too much of the credit when we win, and maybe too much of the blame when we lose.” \nNo one, including Towles, is arguing he has been mistake free this season. \nDuring Kentucky’s 4-1 start, Towles has completed 61.5 percent of his passes with six interceptions and eight touchdowns. In the Wildcats’ lone loss, Towles completed just 8 of 24 passes for 126 yards and two interceptions against Florida. UK Practice Report | Coaches backing Towles \nIn the first half against FCS Eastern Kentucky, Towles threw two more picks while completing 10 of 19 passes. \n“I understand the game enough to know that can he get better? Damn right he can get better,” UK offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson said. “And I can get better and everybody can get better, but he’s doing some things that help us win the game, too.” \nTowles completed 19 of 23 passes for 208 yards and three touchdowns in the second half against Eastern Kentucky. He completed 12 of 14 passes in the final three drives of the game, which all ended in touchdowns. In Kentucky’s win against Missouri, he completed 22 of 27 passes for 249 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. \nA vocal portion of the fan base has called for Mark Stoops and Dawson to give redshirt freshman backup quarterback Drew Barker a chance to lead the offense. Those pleas reached a new high with Kentucky struggling to put away EKU, but Stoops, who had promised to play Barker against the Colonels, reiterated Tuesday he was glad he did not make the move. \n“I’m very glad I didn’t, because I like the result, I like the outcome of that game,” Stoops said. “Would we like (Towles) to be more consistent? Absolutely. Just like every other position on our team.” Stoops defends UK's Towles on call-in show \nStoops issued a passionate defense of Towles on his weekly call-in show Monday when a fan asked why Barker had not received a chance this season, and doubled down on that confidence in his post-practice news conference Tuesday. \nTowles had not heard of Stoops’ comments until informed by reporters, but he acknowledged the benefit of a vote of confidence from his head coach. \n“It for sure helps,” Towles said. “You want your head coach to be in your corner no matter who we’re playing.” \nAs Towles works to drown out the criticism from fans, he has tried to focus only on what Stoops and Dawson have to say about his performance. Dawson blamed the media for some of the heat on Towles, but the UK quarterback knows that scrutiny is part of the job. \nWhile he acknowledged occasionally wondering what it would be like to play a position that garners less attention, Towles said he has no regrets about the path he chose. \n“That’s what I signed up for,” he said. “This is what I want. I want everything that goes in with the position, and I want the struggles that come with it. It’s only going to make me a better player.” \nEmail Jon Hale at jahale@courier-journal.com .
