Bengals better be aware of the backup \nThe Skinny: While starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor is listed as questionable it's highly unlikely he starts, which means backup E.J. Manuel will get the nod. Manuel hasn't thrown a pass this season, but he was a first-round draft pick in 2013 and has made 14 career starts (he has a 6-8 record). \nWhen the Bengals played the Bills in 2013 in Buffalo, backup quarterback Thad Lewis started in place of Manuel and completed 19 of 32 passes for 216 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for a touchdown. That was just his second career start and the Bengals needed overtime to pull out a 27-24 victory. \n\"We gave up four or five big plays in that game: a couple of bombs. a couple of long runs,\" said Bengals defensive coordinator Paul Guenther. \"You can't just think in terms of it being a backup quarterback. Whichever quarterback starts we have to be ready to play.\" \n4. Shady stepping back into the spotlight \nThe Skinny: The Bills traded for running back LeSean McCoy in the offseason and he not only got off to a slow start, he missed the last two games due to a hamstring injury, but is listed as probable for today's game and will likely play, especially with rookie running back Karlos Williams out with a concussion. \nSince week one of the 2010 season McCoy has rushed for the most yards of any back in the NFL (6,301 yards) and is second in yards from scrimmage (8,358). \nThe Bengals struggled against starting running backs the last two weeks. Kansas City's Jamaal Charles had 145 yards from scrimmage (75 rushing on only 11 carries and 70 yards receiving) and Seattle's Thomas Rawls rushed for 169 yards last week. \nMcCoy tallied just 229 yards from scrimmage in the first three games of this season (146 yards rushing on 43 carries and 83 yards receiving). \n3. Can the Bengals protect Andy Dalton better than last week? \nThe Skinny: Dalton was sacked a season-high four times in last week' s game against Seattle and right tackle Andre Smith struggled the most after playing well the first four games. In fairness he was dealing with an elbow injury. \nBuffalo recorded just nine sacks in the first five games, but they have two top-notch pass rushers in end Mario Williams and tackle Marcell Dareus. \nWilliams had 14.5 sacks last season, which tied for fourth most in the NFL, and his 93 since the start of the 2006 season ranks third. \nDareus had 10.0 sacks last season, which ranked first among defensive tackles, and his 29.5 sacks since the start of the 2011 season ranks second to the Bengals' Geno Atkins, who has 33.0. \n2. This likely won't be the week Jeremy Hill gets untracked \nThe Skinny: Hill has simply struggled getting going all season after leading all NFL rookies in 2014 in rushing yards with 1,124 and averaging 5.1 yards per carry. \nIn the first five games this season he rushed for just 176 yards and averaged 3.0 yards per carry. He did score five touchdowns. \nBuffalo's defense ranks third in the NFL in fewest yards rushing per game (82.2 yards) and held four of their first five opponents to less than 100 yards on the ground. \nAs a team the Bengals did rush for 100 yards or more in four of their first five games this season, but it would be a tall task to accomplish that this week. \n1. The Bengals defense can't keep giving up big plays \nThe Skinny: The Bills rank third in the NFL this season in \"big plays,\" which are deemed as any play of 20 yards or more, with 26. The Bengals and Arizona Cardinals are tied for the most with 27. \nThe Bengals allowed 22 big plays in the first five games, but 21 of those came in the last four games. They rank third in the NFL in most rushing big plays allowed with six, while Buffalo is tied for the NFL lead in most big plays on the ground with seven. \nOpponents really haven't consistently driven the ball on the Bengals so far this season. \n\"That's the frustrating thing about it,\" said Guenther. \"I told them we're giving up too many free plays. We can't do that. We need to tighten it up. If we eliminate those big plays all along the season it's a whole different ball of wax. We just need to clean it up and I think we will.\" \nGuenther said the 69-yard touchdown run by Rawls last Sunday was due to an adjustment he made in how he wanted the defense to line up to defend quarterback Russell Wilson on bootlegs. \n\"They had been doing a lot of nakeds with Russell on the backside and I kind of had the ends playing upfield a little bit, and they had the cutback run and they got a good play on us,\" said Guenther. \"I'll take the blame for that. Some of the other runs we sold out, the zone reads and stuff earlier in the game, and we got that cleaned up after the long run. They didn't have much after that.\" \nSeattle had just 46 yards on the ground on 13 carries after the TD run, which came with 8:38 left in the third quarter. \nThe Bengals allowed five pass plays of 40 yards or longer in the first five games, which is tied for the fourth most in the NFL. Guenther said a big reason for that has been miscommunication on the field. \n\"Baltimore, we had them shut out and then gave up a 50-yard touchdown on a missed tackle. San Diego, we had a miscommunication on the back end for a touchdown, and same thing happened this week (against Seattle),\" said Guenther. \"We've got to clean those things up. If we don't give up a long run and don't have the miscommunication that's 14 points right there. When it's loud we need to be signaling to each other what the coverages are and that we're all on the same page. That's the most important thing for us this week.\" \nPrediction: Bengals 27, Bills 17 \nThe Skinny: Buffalo held three of its first five opponents to 14 points or less, but those three teams were the struggling Indianapolis Colts, the struggling Miami Dolphins and the Tennessee Titans, who are starting a rookie quarterback. \nTom Brady threw for 451 yards against the Bills and the Buffalo safety position is an injury-plagued mess. \nThe Bengals scored at least 24 points in all five games this season and gained at least 389 yards in all five games, including over 400 each of the last three. They have been a very dynamic offense no matter who they played. \nBuffalo had just 522 total yards and 24 points in the last two games combined and hard to see its offense getting untracked with the inconsistent Manual at quarterback. \nIt all shapes up to the Bengals going 6-0 for just the third time in franchise history (1975 and 1988 were the other two) as they head into a bye week. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
