It proved to be enough, as Texas scored the game’s first 16 points on a pair of rushing touchdowns by goal-line quarterback Tyrone Swoopes and a 28-yard field by Nick Rose. \nK-State (3-4, 0-4 Big 12) finally got on the scoreboard with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Joe Hubener to Dominique Heath with 32 seconds remaining before halftime, capping a 10-play, 78-yard drive. It was easily the Wildcats’ best possession of the afternoon, as Hubener rushed for a big 18-yard gain, connected with Glenn Gronkowski for 16 yards and then found Deante Burton for 10 yards to help set up the score. \nThe Wildcats’ lone touchdown ended a streak of five straight quarters without a score. K-State’s only other score Saturday was a 36-yard field goal by Jack Cantele in the third quarter. \nOverall, K-State’s offense seemed to pick up where it left from last week’s embarrassing loss to the Sooners. The only bright spot was a career-high 122 rushing yards by running back Charles Jones, who totaled for 87 yards in the second half alone. \n“We really challenged Charles to run hard,” Snyder said. “I liked the way he ran today. He ran probably as aggressively as any time since he’s been here — that’s what we’ve needed him to do. That was the challenge for him during the course of the week and he responded quite well. I was pleased with his effort.” \nHubener, the backup-turned-starter, continued his Big 12 struggles, completing just 10 of 22 passes for 97 yards with an interception. In league play alone, the junior is 30 for 78 (34 percent) with five interceptions and one touchdown. Hubener’s interception on Saturday was lobbed into triple coverage and set Texas up at midfield with less than three minutes to play. The Longhorns (3-4, 2-2) scored their only touchdown of the second half three plays later to put the game out of reach. \nKansas State quarterback Joe Hubener is checked by the trainers after being hurt during the first half on Saturday in Austin, Texas. \n“We were very limited in what we were able to do today,” Snyder said of the passing game. “I know that we’re better than that. You can’t make any excuses as it relates to the weather, but that was an issue for both teams. But we have to better. Taking the weather out of it, we have to be a lot better. \n“We’re capable of it, I’ve seen us do it.” \nK-State’s lackluster offense really did spoil an otherwise sharp defensive second half for the Wildcats. The Longhorns rushed for 188 yards and had 221 yards of total offense in the first half to go along with their 16 points. Much of Texas’ first-half success was due to freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard getting loose for 71 yards on 12 carries. \nBut the second half was a completely different story. The Wildcats walled up inside and contained the speedy Horns QB — holding Heard to just three carries for minus-10 yards in the second half. Overall, K-State held Texas to just 86 second-half rushing yards. Even running back Johnathan Gray was slowed to a crawl in the second half, getting just 14 yards after running for 89 the first two quarters. \n“We did a nice job, corrected what we needed to do, but those are 16 points we can’t back and it killed us,” said K-State defensive tackle Travis Britz, who finished with a career-high nine tackles, including four for a loss. \nBut one thing is certain — though K-State avoided another shutout and was within striking distance of Texas all day — Britz said this team isn’t looking at Saturday’s game as a moral victory. \nThose days are over. \n“I think our team has accepted moral victories in this season already and it came back to haunt us,” he said. “I’m not accepting one now. We still have a lot of mistakes to correct.” \nThe Wildcats will have a few extra days to do just that before they host No. 2 Baylor on Thursday, Nov. 5 for a 6:30 p.m. kickoff on Fox Sports 1. Baylor defeated Iowa State, 45-27, on Saturday. \n“I think this bye week is hitting us at the right time,” said Burton, who caught a team-high five passes for 39 yards on Saturday. “We have a good group of guys, great captains and great leaders, so hopefully they can evoke some emotion into the team and get some soul-searching done because we only have a couple games left.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:23:14.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
