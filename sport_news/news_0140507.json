Probably never, if you are an average 40-hour-a-week worker.\nUnfortunately, due to difficulty in recruiting and retaining prison officers, New Mexico’s state-run prisons are seriously understaffed, and some officers are working those crushing workweeks.\nAs Sgt. Robert Darnell, a four-year corrections officer at the Central New Mexico Correctional Facility in Los Lunas, puts it: “How are you supposed to watch over these (inmates) if you can’t stay awake?”\nGood question. And one for which state officials, both elected and appointed, need to find an answer – before a tense situation blows up.\nThis summer, five of the six state-run prisons had vacancy rates of 20 percent or higher. Western New Mexico Correctional Facility in Grants and the Springer Correctional Center both had vacancy rates of more than 40 percent. That is a safety concern for both officers and inmates.\nIn addition to mandatory overtime, the pay isn’t that great. In 2012 the average corrections officer salary in New Mexico was $31,940, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nationally, in 2011 corrections officers earned an average annual salary of $43,550.\nPrivate prison contracts with the state stipulate staffing levels. If those prisons fail to comply, Corrections can – and has – slapped them with hefty fines. Corrections Department spokeswoman Alex Tomlin says all of the private prisons, except one, are being fined because of low staffing levels there, too.\nCorrections has contracted a study on how to best deploy its sworn officers. It should be done before the 2016 legislative session that begins in mid-January. The primary task of the 30-day session is coming up with a new budget. So more money for raises is a top priority for the Corrections Department. And it should be a priority for legislators and Gov. Susana Martinez, who has been an advocate for targeted raises for essential and hard-to-staff departments – like Corrections.\nThis is a dangerous situation that must be fixed. There are roughly 7,300 inmates in New Mexico prisons, many for violent crimes. And someone has to watch them.\nThis editorial first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal.
