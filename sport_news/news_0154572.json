Our challenge was to see where we stood against that.” \nFreedom stood on even ground with its rival for about 65 minutes, before Hurricanes junior Abe Meral scored his second goal of the game to provide the decisive strike. \nRELATED : Liberty boys soccer's Abe Meral makes his coach look good in win over Freedom \nIt left the Patriots lamenting missed opportunities. \nAbdalla knocked a breakaway opportunity over the crossbar 20 minutes into the first half and, six minutes later, had his sliding stab of a Steven Riad flick stopped by Liberty goalkeeper Tony Silva. \nRiad neatly put away a 1-on-1 opportunity early in the second half, but rest of the Patriots’ chances and half-chances didn’t really stress the Liberty defense. \n“There’s a little bit of a composure issue,” O’Connell said. “I think guys were in spots where they had to put the ball away, or at least put it on frame and see if the keeper could make a good save, or if there’d be a rebound opportunity. We just put too many balls wide or over the top.” \nThe Patriots were effective at limiting the amount of possession that the Hurricanes had, but sharper decisions in the center of the field would have halted Liberty’s ability to counter, according to the coach. \n“Just understanding that moment and the different decisions you can make, I think will be big moving forward,” O’Connell said. \nOf course, the tests ahead will be more challenging if the team is without Abdalla, one of its senior leaders. \n“It’s an opportunity for guys to step up,” O’Connell said. “There are certainly guys that are on the bench, so we’ll see what they do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:52:30.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
