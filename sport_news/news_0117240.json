From where I was, it broke two or three cups, depending on the speed. I saw it and it kept turning and it sunk.” \nHardly ho hum, especially after what happened to Yanoski a year ago. He lost out in a district playoff to advance to regionals. \n“Last year, going to districts, I suffered a tough loss in a playoff, and I thought, do you want to do this again?” Yanoski said. “Do you want to do it? I just told myself it’s not going to happen this time. \n“If I miss this, there are multiple people putting for par from 10 feet and we most likely go down 18. If I make this, I’m mostly in. Whaddya know?” \nWhat was jubilation for the Yanoski clan was heartbreak for Scranton Prep’s Marco Nieto, who missed his 10-footer to force the playoff to continue. \n“Everyone in my family is emotional,” Yanoski said. “It’s fun celebrating.” \nThe first-in-wins scenario played perfectly for Yanoski. \n“You don’t see it very often,” Yanoski said. “Maybe in the Ryder Cup. Something like that doesn’t happen.” \nScoreboard watchers \nFor Holy Cross’ Tom Dzwonczyk, Forest City’s Dylan O’Dell and Wallenpaupack’s Molly Mowatt, the tournament turned into a nail-biting final hour as scores were posted. \n“It was tantalizing,” said Dzwonczyk, whose 79 was two inside the cut line. “I didn’t know for a good amount of time If I was going to get in, but then when I ultimately figured out the math it was pretty cool. \n“It’s special because it’s my last time (going to states). I definitely wanted to get back, especially not playing so well last year. I really wanted to get another opportunity.” \nIt was an even more precarious time for O’Dell, whose four-putt on the par-5 fifth hole threatened to unravel 14 solid holes. \n“It’s not the greatest of feeling out there, but I got it together and made par on the last hole,” O’Dell said. “It was really nerve-racking, seeing all the scores coming in near 80. I thought before the round 80 probably would have been the number to get in.” \nMowatt preferred not to look, leaving it to Wallenpaupack assistant coach Greg Kopich to inform her that she finished tied for 10th with 85, one better than the cut line. \n“I was hitting the ball pretty well,” Mowatt said. “A couple times it was putting that got me. It was a tough day for me to put two holes together. I had a few good holes back-to-back.” \nDISTRICT 2 SCORES \nAt Golden Oaks C.C., par 72 \nBOYS \nx-Ronnie Yanoski, Valley View 78 \nMarco Nieto, Scranton Prep 78 \nIan Langendoerfer, Honesdale 79 \nSahas Chandragiri, Abington Heights 82 \nColin Krokos, Coughlin 89 \nx-won playoff to advance to state tournament \nClass AA (cut 81) \nJim Tressler, Holy Cross 75 \nTom Dzwonczyk, Holy Cross 79 \nDylan O’Dell, Forest City 80 \nAdam Kowalewski, Forest City 83 \nAngelo Mancinelli, Holy Cross 88 \nGIRLS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:44:44.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
