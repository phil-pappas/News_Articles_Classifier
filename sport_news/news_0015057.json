(Josh Holmberg/Las Vegas Review-Journal) Las Vegas Review-Journal \nHere's a look at some of Friday's most interesting high school football games. \nCanyon Springs (2-4, 0-1 Northeast) at Las Vegas (4-1, 0-0) — The Pioneers have finished either first or second in the Northeast League for six straight years, but will need to get hot down the stretch to keep the streak alive. \nCanyon Springs has struggled offensively this season, scoring a total of 75 points, but coach Keith Jones hopes the return of a couple key players from injury will help. \nCenter Ernesto Trejo is back along with running back Diamante Burton. They should help running back Jerrod Blackwell (303 rushing yards), who has scored three of the teams 11 TDs. \nThe seventh-ranked Wildcats have won four straight and are coming off a bye week. \nLas Vegas, led by its read-option attack, has been far better than Canyon Springs offensively. The Wildcats have scored 34 or more points in every game, including 92 in the last two contests. \nGreen Valley (2-4, 0-1 Southeast) at Coronado (2-3, 0-0) — This game features a pair of teams trying to prove they are better than their records show. \nThe Gators are a tough team to get a handle on. Green Valley's four losses have come to opponents with a combined 20-4 record, so they haven't loaded up on cupcakes. But the Gators need to move quickly to make a run in the league. \nCoronado has shown flashes as well, but needs to put things together for four quarters. The Cougars outscored second-ranked Liberty 18-14 in the second half of their game on Sept. 25, but were essentially no shows against Las Vegas last time out, losing 43-0 to the Wildcats. \nDesert Pines (5-2) at Rancho (2-5) — The third-ranked Jaguars haven't lost on the field this season, but had to forfeit a pair of league games earlier this week for using an ineligible player. \nThe forfeits knocked the Jaguars to third place in the Division I-A Sunrise League, and probably are bad news for the Rams. \nExpect Desert Pines to take out some frustration on Rancho, which has lost four straight (including one by forfeit) since a 2-1 start. \nStopping Isaiah Morris, who has averaged 12.1 yards per carry for the Jagaurs, may be too much to ask for the Rams. \nClark (4-3, 2-3 Sunset) at Mojave (4-3, 3-2) — This game could have real playoff implications in the Sunset League. \nClark is coming off consecutive victories after an 0-3 league start, and enters play a half game behind Spring Valley for the Sunset League's fourth and final playoff spot. \nRunning back Milan Dixon (696 rushing yards, 4 TDs) has been Clark's biggest weapon, but receiver Amir Boone (23 catches, 374 yards, 4 TDs) also has emerged as a threat. \nMojave has struggled offensively all season, and things have continued to get worse for the Rattlers, who lost leading rusher Elijah Smoot to a gruesome leg injury last week. Mojave, which has scored a total of 24 points in the last four games, already was without starting quarterback Lamaja Cunningham. Cunningham is out for the season with a collarbone injury. \nCimarron-Memorial (1-5, 0-1 Northwest) at Desert Oasis (5-2, 1-1) — The Diamondbacks have put together one of the area's top records, and will look to continue their strong play in Brad Talich's first season. \nDesert Oasis hasn't gone out and beaten the area's best, but has consistently won the games they should. The Diamondbacks' five wins have come against teams with a combined record of 6-28, but they haven't tripped against a weaker opponent, and will try to continue that trend. \nThe area's two leading rushers will battle it out in this game, with Desert Oasis' Ty'shun McClinton (1,065 rushing yards, 14 TDs) going up against Cimarron's Tyree Riley (1,062 rushing yards, 4 TDs). \nGo to nevadapreps.com for a full schedule and complete scoreboard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:34:33.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
