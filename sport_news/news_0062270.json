What I want is the very best for my teams and that’s what I am working for.”\nMessi is currently sidelined with a knee injury until the middle of next month, with Barca due to visit Ronaldo’s Madrid on Nov. 21.\nThe Catalan side hopes to have him back for that trip to the Spanish capital, but the 28-year-old is not setting himself any deadlines and will only come back when the time is right.\n“[I will return] when I’m feeling [better] and the doctors tell me that I can,” he continued. “I am improving every day without setting myself any targets. I have always said that I don’t set myself any dates because it isn’t up to me. As much as I would like to play tomorrow, the doctors wouldn’t let me. When they tell me that I have recovered completely will be the time that I will make my return onto the pitch.\n“Being injured is the worst feeling in the world for a sportsman, but right from the start I accepted that I had an injury and that the only thing to do was to recover from it the best way possible.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:44:59.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
