Delhi Dynamos FC and Chennaiyin FC (blue jersey) players in action during the ISL match at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi on Thursday \nDynamos began their ISL campaign on a wrong note, losing away to FC Goa and hoped for the locals to be at their passionate best against Chennaiyin. \nDynamos' marquee player-coach, Brazilian legend Roberto Carlos, identifying the need for passionate fans to be the home team's 12th man, earnestly appealed the locals to pack the ground in large numbers, in his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. \nBut when the match kicked off, the 60,000 stadium was sparsely filled, a sight which should not please the former Real Madrid star. \nThe entire upper tier of the stadium was empty, and only the middle tier seats were partially occupied. \nLast year, the home matches in Delhi saw enthusiastic crowds turn up in large numbers in the initial stages of the competition, but deserted the team once results went downhill. \nConsidering it is the first home match of the tournament, the poor response of the Delhi crowd so early in the competition, would pose as a new headache for Delhi Dynamos. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:44:12.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
