UNC is 1-2 in the BSC, 3-2 overall » THE SERIES: This series dates back to when both teams were prominent Division II teams. UC Davis leads the series 5-2, but UNC won last year’s game 27-21. The Aggies are 3-0 at Nottingham Field. » THE COACHES: UC Davis is coached by Ron Gould, who is 8-21 in his third season as the Aggies head coach and 8-21 overall as a college head coach. UNC is coached by Earnest Collins Jr., who is 12-38 in his fifth season as the Bears head coach and 20-50 overall in his seventh season as a college head coach. » THE AGGIES ON OFFENSE: UC Davis is averaging 359 yards of total offense per week with a pretty balanced offense — 116.3 on the ground and 242.8 via the pass. They average 22.7 points per game. The Aggies like to throw the screen pass, to their running backs and receivers and were labeled as “one of the best screen teams in the nation,” by Collins. Quarterback Ben Scott has thrown for 1,377 yards and 11 touchdowns. He’s been intercepted six times, but mainly looks to Chris Martin (20 catches, 374 yards, 5 TDs), Manusamoa Luuga (29 catches, 213 yards) and Ramon Vargas (20 catches, 262 yards, 2 TDs). Luuga leads the rushing game with 353 yards and 3 rushing TDs. The Aggies are ranked fourth nationally in time of possession, averaging 34 minutes, 56 per game, including 40:42 last week against Northern Arizona University. They piled up a season-high 497 yards of offense last week and have most effective on first down, averaging nearly 5 yards. » THE BEARS ON OFFENSE: UNC AVERAGES 357.2 yards of total offense each week, and also features a balanced attack —134 fushing and 223.2 passing. The running game has technically been on hold since starter Trae Riek went down with a concussion three weeks ago. He’s not expected to play today, but backups Anthony Davis (10 carries, 87 yards 2 TDs), Brandon Cartagena 33 carries, 108 yards), and Darrius Graham (49 carries, 171 yards) will share running duties. Redshirt freshman Jacob Knipp is the starting quarteraback, and has been a bit inconsistent while throwing for 687 yards and 3 TDs. He’s also been intercepted 3 times. Knipp has spread the ball around to his receivers, but the leaders are junior Stephen Miller (16 catches, 233 yards, 3 TDs) and Sean Leslie (15 catches, 216 yards, 1 TD. The Bears average 24.6 points each week and when possible will run a hurry-up offense while spreading the field out. » THE AGGIES ON DEFENSE: UC Davis is giving up an average of 31.2 points each week and has allowed opponents an average of more than 200 rushing yards each week and 193.3 via the pass. They’ve battled injuries to a five defensive starters so far. The Aggies are ranked 18th in the nation in third-down defense at .329 and are led by sophomore strong safety Darryl Graham (33 tackles, 1 interception, 2 pass breakups and 2 forced fumbles); and junior linebacker Russell Reeder, a 6-foot-3, 230-pounder who has 31 tackles. Graham is the only sophomore in the starting lineup which is loaded with juniors and seniors. The Aggies have just two interceptions this season. » THE BEARS ON DEFENSE: The Bears can thank the defense for a pair of scores last week as senior cornerback A.J. Battle and senior safety Trevor Douglass returned fumbles for touchdowns in the road victory over Sacramento State. The Bears are giving up an average of 26.4 points per game while yielding more than 200 rushing yards and 231.8 passing yards each week. Junior defensive back Taylor Risner leads the team with 48 tackles and five pass breakups while redshirt sophomore middle linebacker James Riddle has 43 tackles and junior cornerback Thomas Singleton has 38. The Bears have recovered five fumbles, but only have three interceptions. » THE AGGIES ON SPECIAL TEAMS: Kicker Brady Stuart is on a roll, having hit his first seven field goals, 10 dating back to last season. His only miss this season was a 46-yarder last week. He’s the active FCS leader in field goals made and 17th among all active college kickers. Stuart is 8 for 9 on field goals with a long of 43 yards. He’s been automatic from 40 yards or less. Eric Kreitz handles most of the kickoffs and has 10 touchbacks. Junior Colby Woodman handles the punting duties and is averaging 39 yards per punt with a long of 61 yards and has landed 12 inside the 20. Martin is their top return specialist, but has yet to break one for a touchdown. » THE BEARS ON SPECIAL TEAMS: Junior Jamie Falloon regained the kicking duties three weeks ago and has hit all three of his attempts with a long of 38 yards. Freshman Keifer Glau is the punter, averaging 35.8 yards per punt with a long of 54 yards. He’s landed nine inside the 20. The Bears have a pair of legitimate threats on returns — Ellis Onic II and Hakeem Deggs. Onic has returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown and Deggs took last week’s opening kickoff more than 100 yards for a score. Related Media There’s a widely used phrase that C’s get degrees. Technically, that’s true, but for a horde of University of Northern Colorado football players, the middle-of-the-road average grade doesn’t cut it. If there’s a C on their grade reports, it’s a matter of concern. That’s not to say classes are a piece of cake or any UNC players are breezing through in the classroom. The group of smart guys like to call it prioritizing and mastering time management. Dissected further, Earnest Collins’ bunch is posting a team grade-point average of 2.95, led by the smarts of Bryan Stansbury, Jean-Claude Cerezo and Malcom Whye, who proudly display GPAs of 3.9. Stansbury, a 6-foot-3, 225-pound junior linebacker, is majoring in sports and exercise science, formerly known as anatomical kinesiology. Whye had already earned his undergraduate degree in business and is working on a master’s degree in sports administration with law school on his future agenda. Collins set a goal for the Bears to reach 2.80, which was the program’s highest since making the move to Division I 10 years ago. With the arrival of Jimmy Cottrell as an academic advisor in fall 2013, the Bears have increased their GPA every semester from 2.5 in fall 2010 to the current 2.95, up a notch from 2.83 after last spring. Cottrell is no stranger to the field, either. He was an All-American linebacker at New Mexico State University after a standout career at Castle Rock High School. He earned a master’s degree in sports administration from Western Kentucky University. “Our guys really did a good job in the classroom in the summertime,” Collins said. “We had some incoming freshmen who took classes and some veteran guys take summer classes. “It’s a great job by everybody and a nice situation to have,” Collins added. “Any coach who’s worth a grain of salt knows that it’s in the classroom where guys are going to make their mark. What they do off the field is as important as on the field.” Stansbury explained some of his book smarts come naturally, but added “nobody can do it without extra effort. Personally, I want to be the best I can at everything. When you’re given a chance, why not be the best.” This isn’t a case of Collins asking his squad to do as I say and not as I did. Collins, a defensive back and special teams standout for the Bears (1991-94), earned a 3.0 cumulative GPA and a 2.75 in his major classes for anatomical kinesiology. He earned a master’s degree in sports administration from Northwest Missouri State University with a 3.80 GPA. “I may not have been the smartest guy in every class, but I wasn’t even close to the bottom,” Collins said. Neither are his Bears. Jean-Claude Cerezo, a 6-foot-2, 210-pound wide receiver, is majoring in international affairs and came to UNC over water and land. He transferred from Universidad de las Américas Puebla last year during fall camp and played in eight games after competing in the European Junior Championship for Spain. “I study, do homework and play football,” said Cerezo, who cringes at the thought of a B on his resume. “Depending on homework, but every day I am doing some sort of schoolwork. I pretty much compete (in the classroom) for myself.” There is definitely not a language barrier for Cerezo. “I’m fluent in English, Spanish, German and I speak some French,” said Cerezo, who plans to eventually work in international affairs/politics upon graduation. Whye, a 5-foot-11, 160-pound grad student, explained that academics has always been a priority in his family and he reached his goal of earning a bachelor’s degree in business management in four years with a 3.48 GPA. “I always planned to go to grad school though,” Whye said. “My parents always said that the first degree (in college) is not much better than a high school degree.” UNC players are mandated to attend study sessions at least for their first semester, then depending on their GPA, continue to attend. “Most of us like to go to the library because it’s quieter,” Whye said. Cerezo said when he’s at Michener Library, “I’m locked in and I get with it.” Whye and Stansbury usually block out any distractions by listening to music when they study, listening to everything from reggae to rap. “I listen to rap and reggae,” Stansbury said. “I like the way it sounds, and it motivates me.” Whye chooses the rhythm of rapper J. Cole because “he’s a mellow rapper. “Listening to music puts me in the right state of mind ... especially when I’m writing a paper,” Whye added. Whye is the only football player pursuing a graduate degree. “I’m really thinking about law school ... I want to be a sport agent,” Whye said. “Studying is something I enjoy. I did mandatory study time for three seasons.” There’s definitely some classes that take less effort to ace than others for student-athletes. The most popular majors are sports and exercise science and communications. The toughie for Stansbury was anatomy and physiology. “I definitely had to put a lot of work in on that class,” Stansbury said. Collins verified that “we have some real smart guys on this team and it’s awesome go see guys get after it (in the classroom), but added “we also have a few knuckleheads.” “Overall though, good grades are a priority of everybody,” Collins added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:35:01.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
