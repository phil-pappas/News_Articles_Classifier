Will it be called the Apple Ring or the iRing?\nApple recently acquired a patent for a smart ring with a touch screen that can control other devices wirelessly. The ring would go on the index finger and it'd be controlled by the thumb.\nThe unnamed smart ring would also have haptic feedback, which would work similar to the Apple Watch and notify users every time they receive a call, message or email.\n\"The light emitted by a touchscreen may be inappropriate in certain social environments or even dangerous if it gives away the position of a threatened user,\" Apple wrote in the patent. \"A need therefore exists for a more discreet, safer, more efficient, or more ergonomic way to interact with touch pads or touch screens.\"\nAlong with the touch screen and haptic feedback, the ring would also have a microphone used for commands.\nIt has not been confirmed if Apple will actually manufacture the wearable, but some patents don't actually get materialized into functional consumer products.\nRelated Stories Daily News Tech: Appleâ€™s car, watchOS 2 & Pebble Time Round Apple sells 13 million iPhones in opening weekend", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6C91HNxLf4", "http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?docid=20150277559&PageNum=19&IDKey=821BAD5219B3&HomeUrl=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.html%2526r=46%2526p=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526d=PG01%2526S1=(345%25252F173.CCLS.%252BAND%252B20151001.PD.)%2526OS=%2526RS="], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T23:01:13.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
