He was helped off the field and remained on the sideline surrounded by a crowd of players and team officials as the Bulldogs began their second offensive series. He later was carted away but was seated on the sideline for part of the second half. \nGeorgia coach Mark Richt was unsure after the game about the severity of Chubb's injury. \nGeorgia's has a history of bad luck with running backs and knee injuries. \nIn Georgia's overtime victory at Tennessee two years ago, both running back Keith Marshall and wide receiver Justin Scott-Wesley tore ACLs in their right knees to knock them out for the remainder of the season. Todd Gurley's standout career \nRED RIVER RELIEF \nCharlie Strong put that gold cowboy hat on his head and flashed a huge smile filled with relief, joy and vindication. \nIf last week's beat down at TCU was rock bottom for Strong at Texas, his first victory against rival Oklahoma might be what changes the trajectory of his program. Or maybe it was just a temporary respite for the beleaguered Longhorns and their coach. \nRegardless, the 24-17 win against the 10th-ranked Sooners was no ordinary victory for Texas. \nWhen Jerrod Heard and the Longhorns offense got the ball with 3:33 left and Texas leading 24-17, they never gave it back. The Longhorns churned out three first downs, took a knee and then stormed the field as if they won championship trophy. \nNUMBERS \n19_Years since Georgia Tech last lost four straight games. \n35_Years since Michigan had three straight shutouts. \n41_Years since Temple last started 5-0. \n62_Years since Duke opened 5-1 in consecutive years. \nHOME AWAY FROM HOME \nSouth Carolina was forced to play its game against LSU on the road due to flooding and the Tigers made them feel right at home. \nSeveral days of record-setting downpours have left at least 17 dead, flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, shut down a 13-mile stretch of I-95 and left thousands without drinking water. \nLSU put all sorts of touches on the day to make it feel as much like a home game as possible for the visitors. The band played the South Carolina alma mater before kickoff and stadium speakers blared electronic music hit \"Sandstorm\" as is standard practice in South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium. \nBillboards around town were programmed to read \"Geaux Gamecocks! Make yourself at home.\" \nBUCKEYES WIN AGAIN \nOhio State coach Urban Meyer used Cardale Jones to start drives and J.T. Barrett to finish them as Ohio State — still unbeaten and mostly underwhelming — shook off Maryland in the second half for a 49-28 win. \nJones threw two touchdown passes, Barrett scored three times and the top-ranked Buckeyes (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten), who haven't met enormous expectations this season, scored 28 unanswered points in the second half to put away the Terrapins in what may have been Maryland coach Randy Edsall's final game. \nEzekiel Elliott had two short TD runs, Joey Bosa recorded a sack and several pressures and the Buckeyes extended the nation's longest winning streak to 19. Ohio State has won 26 straight regular-season conference games, but again struggled against a huge underdog. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:39:34.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
