Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports PASADENA, Calif. – The United States lost its first key battle against Mexico on Saturday, as the Rose Bowl crowd quickly filled with an overwhelmingly majority of “away” fans.\nAdChoices Tickets for the CONCACAF Cup, a one-off showdown to determine the region’s participant in the 2017 Confederations Cup, were allocated in a manner to try to ensure an even number of supporters for each team.\nHowever, a conservative estimate of the split at kickoff was that around 80 percent of the 92,000 sellout crowd were backing Mexico, with their predominantly green colors blanketing the stadium.\n“Where are the U.S. fans?” said Henry Diaz, a 33-year-old Mexico fan from Los Angeles, in the golf course parking lot where most fans congregated in the hours before the match. “I have been looking for some of them to have a bit of banter but it is all (Mexico).”\nUS Soccer had optimistically hoped for at least a third of the seats to be taken by home supporters. Several players had lower expectations.\n“We have amazing support pretty much wherever we go in the country now,” goalkeeper Tim Howard told USA TODAY Sports last week. “But I don’t hold out much hope for L.A. We will prepare for a road game.”\nWhen Mexico defeated the U.S. 4-2 at the same venue in the 2011 Gold Cup final, there was a miniscule number of U.S. fans, perhaps below 10 per cent of the total crowd.\nThanks to the efforts of fan groups such as the noisy, raucous and wildly entertaining American Outlaws, things have improved. One end of the Rose Bowl on Saturday was almost entirely red, white and blue and was determined to make itself heard.\n“We are outnumbered,” said college student Marlon Crump. “But we knew that was going to happen. We are going to make up for it with our voices and our passion.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:27:55.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
