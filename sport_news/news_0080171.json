There’s no windshield.\n“Or cup holders,” Critz noted.\nWhat the car does have is history, Savannah history. The 1911 E-M-F No. 33 car competed in the final year of what locals call the Great Savannah Races — the American Grand Prize open-wheel automobile races that sped along city streets more than 100 years ago.\n“I wanted this car because I thought that Savannah ought to have one of the cars that raced in the Great Savannah Races,” said Critz, a native of the Hostess City and the president of the Critz Auto Group. “There’s been a lot written about (E-M-F race cars). They were a big deal in the racing world in 1908, ’10 and ’11.”\nRacing eventually came back many generations later to the Coastal Empire, with the Savannah Speed Classic this week on Hutchinson Island the biggest annual competition. It’s partnered with the Hilton Head Island (S.C.) Motoring Festival & Concours d’Elegance on Oct. 30-Nov. 1, which is geared to static displays of vintage cars.\nCritz BMW has sponsored the Savannah event for years, but what’s new is Critz actually will be driving an artifact as a pace car during ceremonies around noon Saturday. He will have goggles, a helmet, driving gloves and a passenger in the left-side seat where a mechanic sat out of necessity during races. Hold on tight, Mayor Edna Jackson, as the car didn’t come with seat belts, either.\nCritz will literally crank up the car to as fast as safety parameters and the mayor will allow. For a sense of how fast the car motored in its brief racing prime, the Nov. 27, 1911 race was won by E-M-F, No. 35, which averaged a little over 58 mph for 171 miles on the 17-mile, rectangular course framed by Montgomery Cross Road and White Bluff roads, Waters Avenue and what is now Victory Drive.\nE-M-F — which stood for founders Barney Everitt, William Metzger and Walter Flanders — sent three Model 30 racers from its Detroit factory to Savannah in 1911 for one of the preliminary events for lighter cars with smaller engines. E-M-F, despite derogatory nicknames such as “Every Morning Fix-It” and “Every Mechanical Fault” in these early days of the auto industry, had reason to boast. The trio finished 1-2-3 in the Tiedeman Trophy Race, named for Savannah mayor and racing supporter George Tiedeman.\nLong road to travel\nE-M-F didn’t last long, as Studebaker bought the company in 1912. The No. 33 car, however, which finished third that November day, went into retirement and was discovered in the 1980s in a New York barn by auto collector Gordon Matson of New Hampshire. He brought it “home” to Savannah in 2008 for the Hilton Head/Savannah Historics.\nDale Critz Jr. is a car guy, too, since birth, as his grandfather opened the first Critz dealership in January 1939 and his father followed in the family business. He didn’t consider himself a serious car collector, though he owns an eclectic mix with a 1949 GMC pickup truck, a 2002 BMW Z8 roadster and a 1958 Isetta microcar (or “bubble car”).\n“I’ve got a few old cars, nothing else like this,” said Critz, who samples his wares by driving a 2016 Mercedes-Benz E63.\nCollecting got more serious as he pursued the No. 33 race car with Savannah in its origin story. Critz said he doesn’t know of other cars still existing from Savannah’s turn-of-the-century races except for one in an Indianapolis museum and another he heard about in Sweden.\n“If there was going to be a car in Savannah that raced in Savannah, this was our best chance,” he said last week. “So that’s why I bought it.”\nIt wasn’t that easy. Matson put the car up for auction in March during a car show in Amelia Island, Fla. Critz had participated in art auctions and, for his job, in wholesale car auctions where writing a big check comes with the territory.\n“That’s inventory. That’s part of business,” Critz said. “This is all emotion.”\nThe No. 33, among the most publicized vehicles at the auction, was projected to sell for $150,000 to $175,000, though that range seemed high for the E-M-F market, Critz said. And that’s for the car as is, driven off the lot with no warranty.\nHe was hoping to spend less, but when another bidder by telephone, apparently from Spain, jumped into the fray, the price kept going up.\n“If somebody else from Savannah was buying it, I’d have probably let them buy it,” he said, laughing.\nHe felt, however, that he couldn’t let this rare opportunity pass. The dealer made the deal.\n“A number of folks have said yes, it went for over the deal, but given what it was, it was a good price for the seller and a good price for the buyer,” Critz said. “I shouldn’t lose money on it if I ever wanted to get rid of it. I don’t know why I’d get rid of it unless somebody else in Savannah wanted to buy it.”\nBut it’s not an investment to him. A pricey toy, certainly, but it’s a piece of history that is shiny and smooth with brass and leather parts. It’s got gauges and tube tires and even a working clock. Above all, it is very cool to drive.\n“No question,” he said. “This is a race car. Race cars were meant to be driven.”\nSAVANNAH SPEED CLASSIC\nPARTY SCHEDULE\nTHURSDAY: Pace Lap Party, 5:30-8 p.m., Ellis Square at City Market, featuring cars and drivers.
