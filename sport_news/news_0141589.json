Another botched translation! Another moment of unintentional comedy, this at an otherwise somber, even sickening memorial.\nThe guide accompanying me and three other journalists on a recent tour of the country examined the accompanying Chinese characters and explained that the translator had omitted the idea of \"climb\" as well as a comma; the sign, referring to the railing, should, sensibly, have read, \"... do not climb over, pay attention to safety.\"\nAt the same site I snapped pictures of \"To avoid congestion prevent stampedes,\" a placard boasting that the museum had \"received visitors more than 500 million person-times\" and other examples of clumsy translations that tourists often discreetly point out to one another.\nThey are funny — \"Pernicious garbage,\" said the sticker over the mouth of an airport trash receptacle; \"Special reclamation orifice\" — but reflect less on the linguistic skills of the well-meaning translators as on the vast and barely overlapping complexities of both languages.\nSome even sound poetic: \"Inside lime plaster, painted cloud-shaped painting, door top wall of title book,\" read a sign at the Meng Shan Giant Stone Buddha near Taiyuan.\nOthers come off as refreshingly blunt: \"Ordinary section\" said a directional sign designed to separate the hoi polloi from VIP passengers on a high-speed train platform in Shanghai.\nNotes from a trip across China's 'Great Firewall' Eric Zorn On my first night here, I found in my room at the China World Hotel a thick, full-color card featuring the logos and addresses of many of America's most popular websites: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Dropbox, Google and so on.\nA list of amenities similar to the pamphlets you find in many hotel rooms...\nOn my first night here, I found in my room at the China World Hotel a thick, full-color card featuring the logos and addresses of many of America's most popular websites: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Dropbox, Google and so on.\nA list of amenities similar to the pamphlets you find in many hotel rooms...\n(Eric Zorn) Examples of awkward translations on signs are becoming increasingly rare in China's major cities, according to news reports, as officials have worked to eradicate what some believe is a culturally insensitive form of mockery.\nStill, there are thousands of examples cataloged online — search for \"Chinglish,\" a term some consider offensive — and a case to be made that it's wrong to call attention to them.\n\"I have no problem with making fun of ludicrous and pompous signage. What I object to is making fun of the language of signage because it doesn't meet some native-speaker norm,\" wrote Australian linguistics professor Ingrid Piller in a 2010 blog post titled, \"Give Chinglish a break!\" \"Getting the whole world to learn English and simultaneously instilling a perpetual inferiority complex in additional language speakers (is) ... perfectly immoral.\"\nI don't know about immoral, but I'll cop to ironic. Very few sign makers in America bother even to try to translate for the benefit of Asian visitors, but if they did, it's a sure bet that Chinese tourists would return home with phone cameras filled with examples of hilarious malapropisms wrought for their convenience, not amusement.\nNot to over pay attention to sensitivity, but all sign translations, even the most butchered, are at heart gestures of welcome and goodwill.\nSmall victories\nSpeaking of sensitivity, the McLaughlin School District that straddles the border between North Dakota and South Dakota last month dropped the \"Midgets\" mascot and team nickname.\nThe move came in response to a request from the Little People of America, an advocacy organization that argued to McLaughlin trustees that people with dwarfism regard \"midget\" as a slur and that it's inappropriate to use those of short stature as mascots.\nThe organization's Chicago-based president, Gary Arnold, told me last week that the group is still having no luck getting the high school in downstate Freeburg, Ill., to discontinue using \"Midgets,\" despite making regular appeals at school board meetings.\nMurder, he rote\nGetting ahead in my work, I'd like to extend my condolences in advance to the families of the victims of the next mass shooting incident in America.\nYour loved one was innocently going about his or her business and was in no way particularly targeted by the deranged gunman. The shooter's alienation and instability had been remarked upon by acquaintances, but law-abiding gun owners have led the fight to continue to allow virtually anyone to quietly arm himself to the teeth, with slaughtered strangers the collateral damage. Very sorry about that.\nAmericans are obsessed with safety — I was recently pulled out of a security line at the airport for a pat-down search because I'd forgotten to take an index card out of my pocket — except when we're not. And it will take a lot more than ( insert number of victims here ) deaths to move lawmakers to restrict the number and type of guns citizens can buy and to impose licensing and training regulations to enforce responsible gun use.\nYou are tearfully, bitterly, demanding action. But thoughts, prayers and our deepest sympathies will have to suffice.\nRe: Tweets\nBecause I was traveling most of the last two weeks, I was unable to ask readers to select a single best tweet from among a set of amusing lines curated from the Twitter micro-blogging site. So I've taken the liberty of anointing this one from Jason Mayland (@JaymayAllDay) the winner:\n\"If Carly Fiorina really wants to destroy Planned Parenthood, she should become its CEO.\"\nThe reference is to the GOP presidential hopeful's performance when she ran Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005, a time when the company's stock price fell more dramatically than its competitors', profits fell and 30,000 workers were laid off. Her camp spins the numbers differently, and it will all matter a great deal if she continues to perform well in the polls.\nFiorina is now running third in the RealClearPolitics' average of national polls with 11.8 percent support, behind fellow \"outsider\" candidates Ben Carson (16.3 percent) and Donald Trump (23.3 percent), and just ahead of traditional candidates U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (9.5 percent) and former Gov. Jeb Bush (9 percent).\nThough I've been on record since January predicting that the Republican nominee will be Ohio Gov. John Kasich (now limping along at 3.3 percent) and I still like his chances for a spot on the ticket, I would now like to move some of my chips over to Rubio. Fiorina, due to the controversy over her business record, seems destined to fade, as does the mealy-mouthed Carson and (stop me if you've heard this before!) the thunderously empty Trump.\nScott Stantis, Kristen McQueary and I discuss guns, crime and the GOP race this week on \"The Mincing Rascals,\" a WGN-plus podcast available on iTunes.\nPost comments about this column to chicagotribune.com/zorn.\nTwitter @ EricZorn\n Commentary Opinion John Kasich", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560efdfb/turbine/ct-china-translation-chinglish-zorn-1004-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560da63c/turbine/ct-china-firewall-still-great-perspec-zorn-1002-20151001", "http://www.twitter.com/ericzorn"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:05:44.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
