We have enjoyed the challenge of 'A' and have worked hard as a team to be ready for the season. Now we are concentrating on our postseason goals.\" \nWindjammers clip Eagles' wings \nIn the team's regular season finale against Mount Ararat, sisters Izzy Gutheinz and Emma Gutheinz netted goals, while Taylor Johnson had one assist. \n\"The girls were very composed during the last two minutes of the game,” said coach Messer. “This was a game where there was a lot of pressure on the ball. The girls really stayed together and were committed to our style of play. In the end we were successful because we possessed the ball from the back to the front. I was very proud of their conduct, sportsmanship and performance.\" \nThe Eagles put three forwards up top in the second half in an attempt to get on the scoreboard, but “Brynne Wrona did a fantastic job eliminating breakaways in the second half,” said coach Messer, who added that Grace Blackwell, Claire Pierce and Bryn Anderson also were paramount to the team's success on the defensive side of the ball against Mtount Ararat. \nAnna Manuel scored the lone goal for the Eagles. \nJana Spieker made six saves in goal for the Windjammers. Camden Hills held a 12-7 edge in shots and 6-1 advantage in corner kicks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:20:41.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
