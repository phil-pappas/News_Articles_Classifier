Currently, she serves as the president of the Lake Washington School (LWSD) Board of Directors and has been elected to this position by her peers. \nIn our experience working with Jackie for over 25 years, she has a proven record of unwavering leadership. Her leadership was demonstrated locally, regionally and statewide in tackling a variety of child advocacy issues for the Parent Teacher and Student Association (PTSA). Jackie continues to be a dedicated student advocate in her decades of service as a member of the LWSD Board of Directors focusing on all students. Her collaboration with fellow colleagues, administrators, teachers and students has placed the Lake Washington School District in the headlines. It was reported that LWSD has achieved a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate. Jackie’s leadership has resulted in a fiscally sound district with clean audit reports and the highest bond rating. \nWe urge you to re-elect Jackie Pendergrass this November as a director of the Lake Washington School Board. \nJill Anderson and Victoria Findley \nSammamish \nWritten by Contributed · Filed Under Letters to the Editor , Opinion \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:34:22.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
