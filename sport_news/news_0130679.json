Bojan sent the resulting spot kick into the top corner, his second goal of the season. \nForward Xherdan Shaqiri spurned two opportunities to double Stoke's lead shortly after the interval shooting high and wide. \nSwansea improved after the restart and Jonjo Shelvey saw his effort cannon back off the post shortly before the hour mark. After outmuscling Stoke defender Philipp Wollscheid , he surged into the box and struck from an acute angle, but to his dismay the ball hit Jack Butland's right-hand post and refused to cross the line. \nShaqiri's finishing may have been wayward but his passing proved more precise as he picked out Marko Arnautovic in the area, only for the Austrian to send a chipped effort past Lukasz Fabianski's goal. \nSubstitute Gylfi Sigurdsson sent a looping effort just wide following his introduction but Gary Monk's side failed to get the breakthrough as it slipped to defeat. \nThat loss leaves Swansea without a win in five league games since its 2-1 victory over Manchester United in August. \n''I need to get the players back to the level that I know they can perform at. I have big confidence in this group,'' Monk said. \n''I've got a good group of players. They'll work hard and we'll stick together and make sure that we come through this little period and come back strong,'' he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:24:02.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
