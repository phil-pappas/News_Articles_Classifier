I don't have anything that's identified to that.\"\nThe score gave Washington State its first points on a day when it went on to tally 45 in the first half, the most for the Cougars in a two-quarter span since 1997. By the end of the half, Falk had six touchdown passes and only five incompletions (28 for 33).\nThe offense also shared responsibility for the lethargic start.\nFor the third game in a row, Oregon State opened its first offensive series with a three-and-out. In their previous two defeats against Stanford and Arizona, the Beavers mustered nine yards on each of their two respective opening drives before electing to punt on fourth and one.\nThere was no such momentum generated on the Palouse.\nSeth Collins' two-yard quarterback scamper was followed with a loss of two and an incomplete pass. Oregon State punted and Washington State grabbed a 14-0 lead less than three minutes later after a seven-play, 69-yard drive.\nAfter Wednesday's practice, offensive coordinator Dave Baldwin took responsibility for allowing the early deficit against Arizona to alter his play calling and put too much emphasis on the pass.\nAndersen said the early struggles on both sides of the ball did not affect the game's play-calling Saturday.\nCollins finished with 124 yards on 23 carries, his third game of the season reaching the triple-digit threshold on the ground. Seven different Oregon State players carried the ball for 218 yards, the team's highest rushing yardage mark since its 35-21 win over San Jose State.\n\"Obviously a week ago we were in a very similar situation,\" Andersen said. \"We were not able to run the ball as effectively against Arizona as we were today. We wanted to stick with that game plan a little bit.\"\nBut even the offensive highlight that emerged out of a lost day only came once the Beavers faced an uphill fight.\nIn the first quarter, Oregon State mustered only 14 yards on eight carries. And it was on the second quarter's second play that Falk lofted a pinpoint 23-yard pass to Gabe Marks, putting Washington State up 21-3.\nBefore the Beavers' offensive game plan had the opportunity to get moving, the team was down by 18 points.\n\"You prepare in practice to play good teams like this and when you get to the game, everything you do in practice has to translate,\" sophomore safety Justin Strong said. \"In that first half, that wasn't the case.\"\nThe Beavers were also penalized eight times for 61 yards in the first half. Perhaps the most crucial was an offside call before Washington State snapped the ball on third and 15 from the Beavers' 46. The Cougars converted the ensuing third and 10 and capped off the drive with Falk's lob to Marks.\n\"We've got a ways to go,\" Andersen said. \"So we'll keep battling.\"\n-- Danny Moran\ndmoran@oregonian.com\n@DannyJMoran", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DannyJMoran"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:22:22.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
