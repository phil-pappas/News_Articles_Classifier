You have to congratulate him, I don't know how he did it,\" said Nolito, who scored his seventh goal in the league to match Ronaldo's haul. \"I take away our effort with only 10 men. We have to be happy despite the loss.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:47:22.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
