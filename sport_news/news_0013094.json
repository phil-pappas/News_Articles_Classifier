Just didn’t see him. They did a nice job disguising the coverage. That gives us something to learn from.” \n— On Utah State LB Kyler Fackrell: “He might be one of the best college football players out there. That guy is very good. We’ve got a huge challenge to try to block him and contain him.” \n— On letting Shane Williams-Rhodes throw a pass: “We’re trying to be on the cutting edge. That’s really our system. ... We’ve got smart guys on our team that allow us to do a lot of things.” \n— He said he takes suggestions from players, including a halftime adjustment the team made at Colorado State (he didn’t want to divulge specifics): “They’re creative, too. They’re thinkers. They’re into the game of football. We encourage that. We want them to think like coaches.” \n— On backups playing: “There’s no mop-up time. Go out there and play. The coaches can call you off by play selection or taking a knee or not blitzing. But your mindset as a player has got to be constant.” \n— One of the important considerations in recruiting Rypien was finding a quarterback who had thrown the ball a lot in high school: “It’s very hard to make up as a coach all those reps that he got in high school throwing. You’re not going to have enough time with him.” \n— On his friendship with Utah State coach Matt Wells, which started when Harsin was the tight ends coach at Boise State and Wells was the tight ends coach at Tulsa: “When I got the head job at Arkansas State, I was five days ahead of him. So I had all the answers for him when he called. We just kind of went through that early stage of our head coaching careers together. It wasn’t really football-related. ... We still do. He’s a guy we can bounce some ideas off of.” Wells interviewed for a job on the Broncos’ staff when Harsin was the offensive coordinator. \n— On the bus ride to Logan: “I’m looking forward to it, actually. I like the bus ride. We’ve done it before. We’ll make our stop halfway ... and get out for a half-hour.” \nOC Eliah Drinkwitz \n— He plans to emphasize the lack of execution in the second quarter last week that prevented the Broncos from blowing open the game: “In key situations, we’ve got to execute better,” he said. “... That could have changed the dynamic of the game. I felt like we gave them momentum right before halftime.” \n— He said Rypien was hit six times during the game. “Some of those were big hits but he delivers big plays. ... We’re going to do a better job protecting him but he’s going to have to do a better job moving in the pocket, sliding out of troubles. Sometimes, he’s got to take one.” \n— On Fackrell: “There are comparisons to Shea McClellin. He’s long and athletic and he’s got a high motor. He does multiple things. Shea was a first-round draft pick. That’s a pretty good comparison ... high praise.” \n— On Williams-Rhodes’ TD pass: “He threw one of the best balls I’ve seen — a dime. ... In my opinion, he’s a special player in this conference. He’s somebody everybody has to be aware of, where No. 1 is on the football field, because of all the things he can do.” \n— The Broncos put the Williams-Rhodes pass in the game plan against Hawaii but didn’t run it because Drinkwitz wasn’t yet confident in the execution. Williams-Rhodes spent special teams periods working on it at practice. \n— On Rypien: “We probably felt like he would have a little bit of growing pains. The biggest thing about Brett is he’s very coachable and hard on himself. He’s able to self-correct things quickly. I don’t think he felt like he performed very well in the second half (against Colorado State).” \nDC Marcel Yates \n— On Colorado State’s TD: “I thought that was a bad call by me. I kind of made the call too early and I wish I would have changed it. That’s on me.” \n— On Colorado State’s offense: “Because that offense is a pro-style offense, it felt like at least up in the box it kind of kept me off-balance.” \n— He said he shifted into the role of more of a brother than a coach while safety Darian Thompson was going through the birth of his daughter last week. “I just wanted to make sure everything was smooth,” he said. “... She’s a beautiful baby girl.” \n— On when he’ll call this defense dominant: “When we are done with the season and we’re a top-10 defense. You won’t hear me say we’re dominant until then. Every week, every opponent can humble you. ... Every week you have to be humble and hungry. Every opponent is different. They’re looking for a weakness in your defense and if they find it it can change around real quick. Dominance isn’t a game or a half a season. It’s a full season of playing that way.” \nNickel Chanceller James \n— On the Colorado State game: “We gave up too many points last game. Ten points is way too much. We’ve got some things to work on. ... Michigan hasn’t given up a point in three weeks, right?” \n— On the short week: “Like we always say, separation is in the preparation. Yeah, we play on Friday, but no matter what we’re going to prepare the same. We still have the same amount of practice. ... It’s a mindset. We’ve got to Bronco up.” \n— On Williams-Rhodes’ TD pass: “It was a little duck, but it was OK.” \n— On offenses: “We don’t let offenses get into a rhythm. If we let offense get in a rhythm, it’s like a song — it just keeps going. It’s terrible.” \n— On playing on the road: “It’s great just watching the crowd die as we beat the teams we beat away.” \nWR Shane Williams-Rhodes — Brett Rypien (@brettryp) October 11, 2015 \n— On coaches suggesting he throw a pass: “I thought they were joking at first. But they were serious because they said it would be unpredictable. That’s a big reason why it worked.” \n— On why he said he had a 25-yard range: “Every day you come out to practice and play catch. I just kind of noticed that I get a little inaccurate after 25. I just let them know. If it’s over 25, they might want to take me out of that.” \n— On the throw: “It was a pretty bad ball but it was in the right spot.” \n— On the Broncos’ creative plays: “Coming in on Mondays, we never know what to expect with these coaches. You never know. It’s always a surprise. That’s one of the joys of coming in every day.” \n— On WR Thomas Sperbeck: “Same thing I said last year, he reminds me of Matt (Miller). He’s got it. ... He has amazing ball skills.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:41:32.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
