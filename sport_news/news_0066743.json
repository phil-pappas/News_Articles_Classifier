(AP Photo/Sergei Grits) \nBORISOV, Belarus (AP) — Neymar set up substitute Ivan Rakitic to score two goals as Barcelona won 2-0 at BATE Borisov in the Champions League on Tuesday, strengthening the defending champion’s lead in Group E. \nNeymar, coming off his four-goal performance over the weekend, again led the team with Lionel Messi unavailable because of injury. \nThe Brazil striker created several opportunities that his teammates failed to finish off before Rakitic broke through from Neymar’s pass with a pinpoint shot from outside the area in the 48th minute. \nNeymar again found Rakitic all alone in the 64th to guarantee three points. \nIn the other group match, Roma drew 4-4 at Bayer Leverkusen. \nThe victory gave Barcelona seven points. Leverkusen remained second with four, while BATE has three and Roma two.
