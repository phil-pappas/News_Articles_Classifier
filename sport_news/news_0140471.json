Their friends swing by, and strangers – even those wearing Oakland Raiders jerseys, are welcome to grab a beer or a shot of liquor.\nBut Martinez knows these tailgates might soon end. If the San Diego Chargers relocate to Los Angeles, the Martinez family is done. Though the proposed stadium sites in Carson or Englewood are closer to home, Martinez won’t buy tickets there. It’s San Diego, or nothing.\nUSA TODAY\n50 things we learned in Week 7 of the NFL season\n“I’m selling the bus,” Martinez told USA TODAY Sports. “I’ll take the wrap off, make it all black, and send it on its way.”\nMartinez isn’t ready to believe the Chargers will leave, and remains optimistic the team is using the threat of relocation as leverage to get a new stadium built in San Diego.\nBut many of the other Chargers fans interviewed before and during San Diego’s 37-29 loss to the Raiders on Sunday seem far more resigned to their team’s eventual departure, which could happen as early as next season.\nUSA Today Sports' Lindsay H. Jones offers perspective on the biggest story lines from Week 7 and whether it's time to panic moving forward. USA TODAY Sports\nIt’s made this an extremely weird year to root for the Chargers, especially on a day when visiting fans filled Qualcomm Stadium by the thousands, so much so that it often sounded and looked like a Raiders’ home game.\nAnd there is irony in that, too, because the Raiders are one of the three teams – with the Rams – interested in moving to LA.\nIn fact, the Chargers and Raiders could be sharing a stadium in the Los Angeles area – which is pretty much what they did Sunday, much to the chagrin of Chargers fans.\nThat’s part of what made Sunday afternoon inside Qualcomm Stadium so odd, with one set of fans so hopeful their team could be moving, and the others so full of dread.\nOne section in the lower bowl had been overtaken by Raiders fans, clad in black and silver jerseys, some in face paint and costumes. It looked like the Black Hole. When Raiders rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper caught a 44-yard pass on a third-and-14 in the second quarter, the crowd chanted “C p.” When Cooper took a screen pass and weaved his way through and past the Chargers defense for a 52-yard touchdown a few minutes later, Raiders fans leapt to their feet and danced.\nAdam Danielski put his hands on head and looked at his feet.\n“This is embarrassing,” said Danielski, who has owned Chargers season tickets since 2000.\nUSA TODAY\nPanthers bottle up Eagles to stake claim as elite team\nThe Raiders led 37-6 early the third quarter, by which point plenty of Charges fans had seen enough. By the time the Chargers started their rally in the fourth quarter, when quarterback Philip Rivers led the Chargers to 23 unanswered points, many seats in the club level were empty, and few fans in blue and white jerseys remained.\nIndeed, this wasn’t a day to find much optimism from Chargers fans, and Raiders fans, many of whom traveled south from Los Angeles for this game, reveled in it.\nRichard Leon, a Raiders from Orange County, was ridiculed for wearing a black and silver jersey in San Diego before the game. He quickly found a way to get retribution as he watched the game from seats in the lower bowl of the stadium behind the Raiders’ bench.\n“You just say, ‘I’ll see you in LA,’” Leon said. “They’re devastated. You can just see that look in their faces.”\nYes, you can.\n“It’s bittersweet,” said Scott Favero, a season ticket holder since 1978. “I just think this is going to be the last year.”\nFavero owns a closet-full of Chargers’ jerseys – he wore a blue No. 37, for safety Jahleel Addae, on Sunday – and has a large collection of memorabilia, much of it dating back to his childhood. But he’s prepared not only to give up his tickets if the team leaves for Los Angeles, but to renounce his fandom altogether.\n“I will burn every piece of Chargers memorabilia I have. Everything,” Favero said.\nThat includes any memorabilia in Pete’s Place, the bar he owns in La Mesa. If the Chargers leave San Diego, he vowed that he won’t even show their games on television. He’ll spend the money he would have spent on his tickets on trips to other NFL cities. Maybe Philadelphia one week, and Green Bay another. Maybe he’ll eventually pick a new team.\n“My friends, and the people I hang out with, the people who come to my bar, they are pretty much like F the Chargers. We're done. They’re dead to us,” Favero said. “I've talked to people who are like, ‘I'm a Chargers fan, I'll still root for them.’ But no one's going to LA.”\nSo maybe Gonzo Ramirez of Spring Valley is an exception. He fashions himself a “diehard” fan – and that’s the word he has printed on the back of his navy blue jersey. The jersey, with the number 00 on the front, is covered in patches, including D2 on the shoulder to indicate where he’s set up his elaborate tailgate for the past 23 years.\nHe figures he’ll drive two hours north on the 405 to see them if they move to L.A.. His only breaking point would be if the team were to leave and also change its name.\n“I’m not a San Diego fan, I’m a Chargers fan,” Ramirez said.\nRamirez’ seats are just a couple of sections away from where San Diego residents Ted Claudat and Danielski have owned seats since 2000. To these friends, their fandom – or at least to the extent to which they’ll pay money to go to games -- does have geographic limits.\n“Once you get out of the county, it’s not your team anymore,” Claudat said, from his seats in Section 16, in the lower bowl of the stadium behind the goal posts in the north end zone.\nIn the 15 and a half seasons since they first bought their tickets, they haven’t missed a single game. Claudat said he used to know all the other season ticket holders with nearby seats, but in recent years, the tickets have changed over so many times, his neighbors are strangers.\nAnd that’s when they even show up at all.\nThere were two empty seats to Claudat’s left on Sunday, and a pair of empties in front of him.\n“They want to say that 25% of our fans are from Orange County? That’s BS. You know who the Orange County fans are? Them,” Danielski said, pointing at the empty seats.\nFollow Lindsay H.
