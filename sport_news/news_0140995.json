By KEVIN DRULEY - kdruley@shawmedia.com \nDarby Lillibridge once wielded a hockey stick. She wishes she could again. \n“Actually, I miss it a lot,” Lillibridge said, smiling and showing all her teeth. “My mom took me out when I was little. She didn’t want a third hockey player in the family, so, yeah.” \nGolf and hockey lately have been mutually exclusive for the Lillibridges, an athletic-minded clan that now watches Darby shine as a sophomore for the Geneva girls golf team. \nOlder brothers Colin and Graham also are former Vikings golfers. Graham and Darby’s prep careers could have intersected last fall, but Graham elected not to compete for Geneva as a sophomore, focusing on his budding hockey prospects instead. \nThese days, Graham, 16, is a first-year defenseman for the Muskegon (Mich.) Lumberjacks of the United States Hockey League, the U.S.’s lone tier-1 junior hockey league that this season oversaw the relocation of the Chicago Steel from Bensenville to Geneva’s Fox Valley Ice Arena. \nMuskegon makes its first of three visits to Geneva on Nov. 6. You don’t have to remind the Lillibridges. \n“My brother will be out there in November to play, so there will be a lot of people there from Geneva to watch,” Darby said. \nThe Lumberjacks also are set to play at Fox Valley on Jan. 17 and April 8. Each game figures to be bittersweet for first-year Steel coach Dan Muse, a former Yale assistant who recruited Graham to the Ivy League program. \nThat was before the summer, of course, when the Chicago-based USHL announced the Steel’s relocation and a revamped coaching staff. The Steel, who host the Tri-City (Nebraska) Storm at 7:30 p.m. today and 7 p.m. Saturday, drew 904 fans to a season-opening, 5-1 win against the Team USA U17 program on Sept. 26. \nImagine that crowd as a gallery for a Lillibridge golf showdown. \n“Our whole family has golfed,” Darby said. “My brothers still do sometimes. My dad plays a lot, my mom, as well. So we’re just a golfing family.” \nSee the future … again: Class-A Cubs prospects called Fifth Third Bank Ballpark home from 2013 to 2014, but after some player-development contract shuffling around this time last fall, Cougars fans only will see potential future North Siders in Geneva every other season. \nMark your calendars – or magnetic schedules – for the recently renamed South Bend Cubs’ first visit to Kane County, set for July 16-18, 2016. The Cougars, who play in the Midwest League’s Western Division, visited South Bend, an Eastern Division club, in 2015. \nThe Cubs series, held from a Saturday through a Monday, closes a six-game homestand that begins with a three-game visit from the West Michigan Whitecaps, a Detroit Tigers affiliate that dethroned the Cougars as MWL champs last month. \nThe Cougars open the 2016 MWL season at home, facing Clinton at 6:30 p.m. April 7. \n• Kevin Druley is sports editor of the Kane County Chronicle.
