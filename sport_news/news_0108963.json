The shutout was the 11th of Hildebrandâ€™s career. \nStenglein got the Spartans on the board with 20 seconds remaining in the opening period, beating Laker goaltender Nick Kossoff with a nice move in close for his third goal of the season. \nThe Spartans struck again late in the next period as Ebbing just got a piece of a Rhett Holland point shot and tipped it past Kossoff to make it 2-0 with 1:12 to play in the second. \nThe Spartans will be off next weekend and will return to action at home, Nov. 6-7, against New Hampshire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:45:58.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
