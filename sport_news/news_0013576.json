However, No. 5 Baylor achieved its fifth victory in as many seasons with a 63-35 win against Texas Tech in Arlington.\nHere are five thoughts from Texas Tech's loss.\n1. Second quarter separation\nTexas Tech trailed by double-digits when the quarter started but Baylor's run in the second quarter put the Bears ahead comfortably and allowed them to take a 49-28 lead into halftime. Sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes managed to locate freshman Tony Brown Jr. on a 13-yard touchdown pass, but three of Texas Tech's four other possessions ended with turnovers. Shock Linwood put the Bears ahead 35-14 on an eight-yard run following a fumble by senior DeAndre Washington. Garland native Seth Russell continued to pile on with a 16-yard touchdown pass to junior receiver and Richardson-Pearce graduate Corey Coleman following an interception from Mahomes.\n2. Turnovers\nDespite passing for 415 yards and three touchdowns, Mahomes did toss a pair of interceptions in the loss. Mahomes threw into coverage in the second quarter and Xavien Howard made the most of his opportunity with a 46-yard interception return. Baylor responded with a 16-yard touchdown. Travon Blanchard also intercepted Mahomes in the third quarter. A fumble by DeAndre Washington was answered with an 8-yard rushing touchdown from Shock Linwood. The Bears scored 14 points off turnovers.\n3. Penalties\nTexas Tech appeared to be a more disciplined team before facing Baylor. The Red Raiders were the Big 12's most penalized team in 2014 - trailed by the Bears - and transformed into the least penalized Big 12 team of 2015 through the first four games. Texas Tech received 21 penalty flags in its first four games this season. Against Baylor, Kliff Kingsbury's bunch was penalized nine times in the first half alone, finishing with 17 penalties for 142 yards. The Red Raiders don't need a perfect game against the Cyclones, but Texas Tech will need to focus its disciplinary efforts before next weekend's matchup against Iowa State.\n4. Extending the play\nThe status of Texas Tech's quarterback was an uncertainty beyond the team's facilities and Mahomes continued to display the ability to improvise and extend plays that helped him earn the starting role. In the team's opening possession, Mahomes escaped the pocket and found sophomore receiver Zach Austin on a 55-yard touchdown pass. It was Austin's first catch of his career and he finished as the Red Raiders' leading receiver with eight catches for 110 yards.\n5. Fast starts continue\nAfter scoring a touchdown in their opening possession against the Bears, the Red Raiders have scored a touchdown on four of five opening drives this season. A struggle to maintain offensive balance ultimately derailed Texas Tech's chances before halftime. The Red Raiders rushed for 14 total yards in the first quarter, gaining one first down on the ground. Tech's rushing attack finished with 106 yards on 24 carries with one touchdown - a 25-yard run by Mahomes.\nBaylor 63, Texas Tech 35: Complete coverage\nBox score\nDiscuss this game and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday; ask questions now\nPhotos: Baylor shows up in grey, makes Tech pay in AT&T Stadium rout\nFive thoughts: Statement win for Bears?\nBaylor quotable: Art Briles says Bears 'trying to prove we belong'\nTownsend: Running Bears step over Tech on potential path back to Arlington\nBaylor's Linwood sets career high with 221 yards against Texas Tech\nFive thoughts: Sloppy play leads to another loss in the series\nTexas Tech quotable: Baylor WRs 'best group' Kingsbury has coached against\nTexas Tech defense has another lapse, allowing Baylor big yardage\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/townsend-running-bears-step-tech-potential-path-back-arlington", "http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/baylors-linwood-sets-career-high-221-yards-texas-tech", "https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-tech-defense-another-lapse-allowing-baylor-big-yardage", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-tech-quotable-corey-coleman-baylor-wrs-best-group-kingsbury-coached-seniors-rally-teammates", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/baylor-quotable-win-texas-tech-dominant-defense-exceptional-tough-red-raider-attack", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030079&home=79&vis=86&final=true", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesportsgallery/2015/10/03/photos-baylor-shows-grey-makes-texas-tech-pay-att-stadium-rout", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-sloppy-play-paces-texas-tech-fifth-straight-loss-baylor"], "published": "2015-10-04T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:56:33.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
