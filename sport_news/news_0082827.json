The debate, moderated by FOX 8 anchor John Snell, was held at the governor’s mansion.\nOne of the major problems facing the state: how to fix the budget deficit. It was the first question asked of the three candidates tonight.\nRepublican Jay Dardenne said he wouldn't rule out raising taxes, saying he doesn't take anything off the table. However Democrat John bel Edwards said it's not something he would consider for the state. Republican Scott Angelle said he doesn't think it's an option we should have to look at.\nThe candidates were also asked about the Lafayette, La., theatre shooting and their stance on the state of mental health care in Louisiana, given that so many programs have been shut down by the current administration. All three candidates agreed that more needs to be done to help the mentally ill.\nWhen it comes to higher education, all three agreed that it needs to be fully funded, but they differ on how long that will take and just how to fund it.\nThey were also asked about the fourth candidate in this race, David vitter, who declined to attend, and his past sex scandal. All three say a candidate’s past is absolutely something voters should consider, and they believe Vitter should have been at the debate.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
