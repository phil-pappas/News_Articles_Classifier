In fact, the defenseman said he had no feeling at all about DeBoer's return to Prudential Center Fas coach of the San Jose Sharks Friday night. \nThere's no special feeling. It will be another game we have to win,\" Larsson said. \"He's done a good job with them so far. We can't really deny that. He did good job with us, too. He took us to the Final the first year.\" \nBut did he do a good job with Larsson? \n\"Sometimes, yeah. He did what he thought was best and I never started questioning myself,\" Larsson said. \"No hard feelings or anything from my side. That's in the past.\" RELATED: A candid Q&A with Pete DeBoer New Jersey Devils players arrive for season opener via red carpet New Jersey Devils fans watch as player arrive along a red carpet outside the Prudential Center for their season opener against the Winnipeg Jets Oct. 10, 2015.

Zajac missed his second straight day of practice for maintenance. \n\"He's a real possibility for tomorrow. Just another day to evaluate some things with him,\" Hynes said. \"But it's nothing serious or long-term with him. We expect him for tomorrow.\" \nCory Schneider, whose wife gave birth to son Wyatt early Tuesday morning, said he should be able to start against the Sharks. His wife and son came home Thursday afternoon after a precautionary day in the hospital. \n\"I should be (ready). I feel good,\" Schneider said. \"I caught up with some sleep last night. Getting back into it yesterday I felt good but I had to get that stamina back a little bit. Today I felt even better. I see no reason why I shouldn't be available and good to go for tomorrow.\" \nWill he start? \n\"There's a good chance of that,\" Hynes said. \"We just want to make sure he's good to go physically. He had a couple of long days with his family situation.\" \nJohn Moore (bruised right forearm) will play after sitting out one game. \nSJ \"They've all been tough. We know they're a good team. They're well-coached, they've gotten off to a strong start and they're playing some real good hockey. We're definitely aware of them and are doing our homework on them. We have to get our game going. We look forward to tomorrow to hopefully having our best game.\" \n* * * \nJordin Tootoo fined $2,217.74, the maximum allowable under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, for a dangerous trip against Nashville Predators defenseman Seth Jones during Tuesday night's game in Newark. \nThe incident occurred at 7:55 of the third period.
