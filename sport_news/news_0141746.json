By Daniel Bevan (columnist) 05 Oct 2015 10:14:41 \nreads \ncomments \nThe Ballon d'Or is the single most prestigious prize a footballer can win and is awarded to the best player of the calendar year. Ever year it sparks controversy and this year is no different with no fewer than 59 players have been named in the so called “longlist”. \nThe only two English players who have been named on the shortlist are Harry Kane of Spurs and Wayne Rooney of Manchester United. The clubs with the most number of players on the list are Barcelona (Claudio Bravo, Javier Mascherano, Andres Iniesta, Lionel Messi, Neymar, Luis Suárez and Ivan Rakitic) and Real Madrid (Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, Sergio Ramos, Cristiano Ronaldo, Luka Modric, James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos) both with seven respectively. \nGerman Champions Bayern Munich earn five names of the list (Robert Lewandowski, Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Thomas Muller, Manuel Neuer). \nIn the Premier League, Manchester City boast five players on the list (Wilfried Bony, Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero, Nicolas Otamendi, and Kevin de Bruyne) and a notably absentee is David Silva who was overlooked by Wilfried Bony. Chelsea also have four player named (Diego Costa, Willian, Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard). \nSerie A Champions and Champions League finalists Juventus have six players included (Giorgio Chiellini, Paul Pogba, Alvaro Morata, Arturo Vidal, Andrea Pirlo, Carlos Tevez) and but Gianluigi Buffon did not make the cut. \nDefiantly the biggest surprise of the list is the inclusion of Queen’s Park Rangers midfielder Massimo Luongo, who spent most of the year at League One Swindon. Luongo was included for his heroics in the Asia Cup, which saw him lead Australia to the title. \nLeicester’s Shinji Okazaki also makes the list for his performances at the Asia Cup and in the Bundesliga for Mainz. \nAnother two shock inclusions are Christian Atsu of Bournemouth (on loan from Chelsea) and Andre Ayew of Swansea for their efforts at the Africa Cup of Nations for Ghana. \nTwo current MLS players, one player from the Argentinian League and one player from the Liga Do Brazil join Europe's elite in the form of Giovani dos Santos (LA Galaxy), Andrea Pirlo (NYC FC), Carlos Sanchez (River Plate) and Paolo Guerrero (Corinthians). \nThe full list: Claudio Bravo - Barcelona \nJavier Mascherano - Barcelona", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:02.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
