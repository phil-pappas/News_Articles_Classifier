The NCAA must grant medical redshirts for an extra year of eligibility. \nWhittingham said, “Now we’re to the point we think he’s going to be best served to try to get this waiver.” \nPatrick walked onto the team in 2014 and quickly earned a scholarship. He started four games that season, played in nine and caught 16 passes for 177 yards.
