Also, Gibson, a strong defender, has logged only one game after offseason ankle surgery. And the Bulls' regular rotation has been more out than in because of injuries or precautionary reasons thus far.\nBut Hoiberg has acknowledged the challenge of incorporating a new offensive system predicated on pace and quicker shots while maintaining the defensive identity that has defined previous Bulls' seasons. The early returns aren't encouraging.\nThe Bulls are allowing 47.1 percent shooting, including 40.4 percent on 3-pointers. They have surrendered 109.8 points per game through their first five. And advanced stats place the Bulls allowing 110.5 points per 100 possessions.\nNew system or not, that has to change.\n\"The fact we're not getting back in transition, that's the disappointing thing. That's something you should be able to take care of every night,\" Hoiberg said. \"That's obviously going to be a big emphasis in practice the next few days.\"\nThe Bulls took Friday off save for a mandatory team charity function but have two practices scheduled this weekend before facing the Hornets on Monday in Charlotte. And it's not just floor balance for defensive transition that needs to be addressed.\nHoiberg cited a laundry list of concerns.\n\"Pick-and-roll defense, especially in the middle of the floor, we're not keeping it on the side well enough. (The ball) is getting into the middle too much,\" he said. \"And we're giving up too many blow-bys. There's nothing you can do about those. By the time you get over, it's going to open up a wide open shot on the backside. So we have to guard the ball better.\"\nWith a veteran team returning virtually intact save for the swap of Nazr Mohammed for first-round pick Bobby Portis, the trust factor defensively should be solved. But Hoiberg also is playing more offensive-minded players such as Doug McDermott and Nikola Mirotic more minutes.\nTime will tell if this is merely lack of rotational continuity in preseason or a long-term issue. But the Bulls have been elite defensively long enough to know the current ways must change.\n\"I know it's preseason but these are big numbers (against us) right now,\" Noah said. \"We have a lot of moving parts, but we have to know what we're doing and build a structure. I know I have to do better, be a better leader. I have to understand the system better. It will happen.\"\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Copyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Bulls Fred Hoiberg Taj Gibson Joakim Noah Charlotte Hornets Nazr Mohammed Pau Gasol", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562194f8/turbine/ct-defense-work-in-progress-bulls-spt-1017-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:50:33.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
