COLUMBIA, Mo. - \nA 62-yard drive ending in a field goal stood up as the only scoring drive for the Missouri Tigers Saturday night, losing to No. 11 Florida at Faurot Field. \nFreshman Tiger quarterback Drew Lock passed for 151 yards and threw two interceptions, one of them returned for a touchdown, as the Florida Gators improved to 6-0, holding onto first place in the East division of the Southeastern Conference. \nGator running back Kelvin Taylor scored both offensive touchdowns for Florida, rushing for 99 yards total on 28 carries. \nFlorida's offense spent nearly two-thirds of the game with the ball, while Mizzou converted just one third down out of 14 tries. \nMissouri will play the Georgia Bulldogs next Saturday. \nCopyright Â© 2015 KMIZ - The Networks of Mid-Missouri.
