In honor of Super Bowl 50, here are 50 things we learned in Week 6:\nAdChoices 1. So Pittsburgh Steelers WR Martavis Bryant catches his first TD pass of the season. From Landry Jones. Just as we all predicted it would happen in the preseason.\n2. And, yes, now we know why Pittsburgh was so excited to get Bryant back in the lineup. Electric.\n3. When is a catch a catch? Don’t ask us, because we are thoroughly confused after Detroit Lions WR Golden Tate was awarded a touchdown after he didn’t complete the catch in the end zone like the rule says he needs to do.\n4. Maybe the NFL just figured it owed the Lions one … or five.\n5. Was that a Pee-wee Herman dance Steve Smith Sr. did after his touchdown?\n6 . The New York Jets defense was very impressive and will just get better now that Sheldon Richardson is back. At least we think they will. Check back after next week’s game in New England.\n7. One line that stuck out from Miami Dolphins interim coach Dan Campbell’s introductory press conference: “I’m not saying we want dirty players, but we are going to walk that line.” Olivier Vernon’s low hit on Titans QB Marcus Mariota was over the line. It also changed Sunday’s game for the Dolphins, who took advantage of the hobbled rookie.\n8. Vernon can expect to see one of the \"fine\" envelopes from the league at his locker this week for his hit.\n9. Look at the Carolina Panthers growing up right before our eyes. Impressive win over the Seattle Seahawks. Statement win. Call it what you will. But we will make this statement: We were impressed.\n10. Peyton Manning has now thrown three pick-sixes this season. You can’t blame Gary Kubiak’s offense for that.\n© Jason Miller/Getty Images Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning reacts after an incomplete pass during the first half against the Browns on Sunday in Cleveland. 11. And, sorry, but one long TD pass doesn’t make up for all the bad passes - including three interceptions. There is reason for concern in Denver, as far as the offense goes.\n12. Washington Redskins CB Bashaud Breeland took the ball from the grasp of Jets WR Brandon Marshall. You know how hard that is to do? Respect.\n13. It snowed in Buffalo before kickoff. The season has officially started.\n14. Robert Griffin III was active for the Redskins. First time this season. Just figured you wanted to know.\n15. The Buffalo Bills: Contenders or pretenders? Come on, you know the answer.\n16. The hotel fire alarm at the Panthers’ hotel in Seattle went off around 5:30 a.m. Sunday. This is what it has come to for the Seahawks? They might want to try 4:30 a.m. next time.\n17. The Lions won a game. And don’t think we missed the irony that Detroit used a fake punt to overcome a late seven-point deficit. Live by the fake punt, die by the punt in the state of Michigan this weekend.\n18. Thursday flashback I: On the night the New Orleans Saints honored Steve Gleason, Michael Mauti’s blocked punt for a TD was the most fitting tribute and evoked a tear upon recalling Gleason’s famous blocked punt in 2006.\n19. No fourth quarter lead is safe in Seattle ... if you’re the Seahawks, that is.\n20. The Broncos might be the worst 6-0 team in the league. But at least 30 teams wish they could say that.\n© Brett Carlsen/Getty Images Jeremy Hill #32 of the Cincinnati Bengals scores a touchdown over the defensive effort of Stephon Gilmore #24 of the Buffalo Bills during the first half at Ralph Wilson Stadium on October 18, 2015 in Orchard Park, New York. 21. The Cincinnati Bengals get a well-deserved week to enjoy their 6-0 start and then come back on Nov. 1 at Pittsburgh. We already have that game circled as “must-see .”\n22. The Arizona Cardinals defense stopping Pittsburgh on third-and-shorts in the first half was quite impressive. Unless you’re a Steelers offensive lineman, of course.\n23. Great job by Ed Hochuli immediately looking at Steelers QB Mike Vick, sending him off for a concussion evaluation after he got kicked in the head. That is how the system is supposed to work.\n24. Vick returned with the Steelers saying he left because of dirt in his eye. Guess the system still needs some work.\n25 . If we ate Buffalo wings every time the Bills special teams committed a penalty we would weigh 300 pounds. Not a good look, Rex.\n26 . In in the eight early games on Sunday, there was at least one score in every game during the first quarter. In four of the games, both teams scored. We found it interesting. Sorry if you don’t.\n27. Another Aqib Talib pick-six. The Broncos defense scored again this week, their fourth TD of the season. Yawn.\n28 . Bengals QB Andy Dalton threw a touchdown pass to TE Tyler Eifert. again this week. Yawn II.\n29 . Adrian Peterson had just 1 yard in his first seven carries. The rest of the game didn’t get much better, and he finished with just 60 yards on 26 carries.\n30. Josh McCown and Kirk Cousins returned to being the QBs we thought they were. So there’s that.\n© Derick E.

Mandatory Credit: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports 31 . Thursday flashback II: The Saints have struggled at home lately, but are 19-2 at the Superdome in prime-time games.\n32 . Gary Barnidge: You can’t stop him - you can only hope to slow him down. And even Denver couldn’t. The Browns TE had two more touchdown catches Sunday.\n33 . Barnidge, by the way, is the first Browns TE to catch touchdown pass in four straight games since Ozzie Newsome in 1981.\n34 . Players still love Andy Reid, as witnessed by Marcus Peters handing him the ball after his interception. Reid was a Peters fan when others weren’t. the player obviously remembered.\n35 . We might find out soon if Reid’s bosses feel the same way about him.\n36. Landry Jones was very impressive stepping in for the Steelers. Which could mean this is the last time we see Michael Vick on the field.\n37 . Doesn’t there have to be a new Papa John’s commercial where Peyton invites you to \"pick six\" toppings? We’re sure we’re not the first to think of that, but we like it anyway.\n38 . The J ets have outscored opponents 34-0 in the third quarter this season. That says something about coaching, doesn’t it?\n39. Indianapolis Colts fans hung a \"CHEATERS EXIT HERE\" banner over the railing next to Patriots tunnel right before halftime. Security removed it.\n40. How about the Green Bay Packers stopping the San Diego Chargers on the goal line to seal a win? They were due: Philip Rivers passed for 503 yards.\n© Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch is tackled by Carolina Panthers middle linebacker Luke Kuechl 41 . We would ask Demaryius Thomas to pick up our lunch for us, but we’re afraid he would drop it.\n42. We didn’t need to see Panthers LB Luke Kuechly was back. We could hear the hits.\n43. Geez, the Jacksonville Jaguars are bad. We mean really bad.\n44. So, as it turned out, the University of Michigan had only the second worst punt play of the football weekend, supplanted by what the Colts did Sunday night.\n. 45 . Cam Newton now has 36 career rushing TDs. That ties Vick for the all-time high.\n46. Lions WR Calvin Johnson made the decisive catch in OT to remind us he is Calvin Johnson.\n47 . Look on the bright side, Baltimore Ravens: At least Josh Scobee missed that field goal when he played for Pittsburgh. Or you would be 0-6. Glass-half full.\n48. San Francisco 49ers WR Torrey Smith caught a 76-yard touchdown pass against his former team. That might have even left Ravens WR Steve Smith Sr. speechless. But probably not.\n49. Ricardo Lockette’s 40-yard touchdown catch for Seattle was the dazzle on the Seahawks’ razzle-dazzle play in the third quarter.\n50. What happened to “Omaha”? Peyton Manning now seems to be using “Buffalo” instead as an “audible,” “decoy” or whatever it is.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/titans/2015/10/18/marcus-mariota-hit-ken-whisenhunt-miami-dolphins/74188560/", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:35:56.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
