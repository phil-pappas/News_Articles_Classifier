The Red Wings lost in overtime to Calgary on Friday night.\nChristopher Tanev and Brandon Sutter scored, Miller made 25 saves and Vancouver (3-2-3) dropped to 0-2-3 at home. Alexandre Burrows had two assists and Vancouver led 2-0 after 40 minutes.\n\"We weren't good enough in the first two periods,\" Mrazek said. \"We talked in the dressing room that we had to be better and play smarter.\"\nThe Red Wings got one back when Pulkkinen beat Miller through the five-hole on a breakaway for his fourth of the season at 4:25 of the third.\nDetroit then went to work on the power play and tied the score when Tatar fired shortside on Miller for his second at 6:59.\nVancouver is 0-2-2 on this current five-game homestand.\n\"If we knew why it would be a lot easier. They came hard and we just didn't have that response,\" Sutter said. \"It's not fun when you have a homestand like this. You look at the hockey we've played through it all, we've played pretty well. We've just have five- or 10-minute lapses where we're mentally not sharp and not doing things right.\"\nThe Canucks led 2-0 after Sutter's third of the season 8:02 into the second. Moments after Jared McCann hit the post and Sedin had his shot cleared off the goal line, Sutter took a feed from Burrows in front and ripped a shot past Mrazek.\nVancouver scored two power-play goals after snapping an ugly 1-for-22 stretch with a man-advantage goal in Thursday's 3-2 loss to the Washington Capitals.\nMiller was largely untested in the first two periods against a team playing its third game in four nights, but he made a save on Nyquist's shot with a minute to go in the second that just trickled wide.\nThe Canucks blew a third-period lead in that loss to Washington and went after the Red Wings right off the opening faceoff on Saturday. Henrik Sedin tested Mrazek with two good chances inside the first 3 minutes before Burrows was stopped on a short-handed breakaway.\nVancouver eventually opened the scoring with 6:57 left in the period on the power play when Tanev took a pass in the slot and fired a shot past Mrazek's glove for his first of the season.\nNotes: Detroit was without defensemen Mike Green and Kyle Quincey after both suffered injuries against the Flames. ...
