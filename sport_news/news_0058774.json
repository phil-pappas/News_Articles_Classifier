(Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) Morgan State can improve to 3-0 in the MEAC and move into a tie for first with a win over Savannah State. \nSAVANNAH STATE (1-3) @ MORGAN STATE (2-2) \nWhen: Saturday, 4 p.m. \nAudio: WEAA 88.9 FM \nSeries: Morgan State leads, 6-0 \nWhat's at stake: Saturday's 26-6 victory at Delaware State helped the Bears improve to 2-0 in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, but they are in a second-place tie with Norfolk State (2-3 overall, 2-0 in the conference) and need a win this weekend to tie Bethune-Cookman (5-1, 3-0) for first in the league. Morgan State can stay in the hunt for sole possession of first place and get off to its first 3-0 start in the MEAC since 2009 with a win against the Tigers. Since joining the league for the 2011 campaign, Savannah State has finished in last place out of 11 teams every year. The Tigers could avoid a similar fate after defeating Florida A&M, 37-27, a week ago. That victory snapped a 24-game losing streak and a 32-game skid in the conference for Savannah State, which last visited Hughes Stadium on Oct. 8, 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:47:20.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
