Cassel made 71 starts for New England, Kansas City and Minnesota and has 33 wins to just five for Weeden, although both have losing records for their careers.\nThe Dallas offense has posed little threat down the field with Weeden, and the running game has struggled with extra defenders closer to the line of scrimmage.\nIn their 30-6 loss to New England last Sunday, the Cowboys went without a touchdown for the first time since kicking six field goals in an 18-16 win over Washington in 2011. Romo played that game with cracked ribs.\n\"This position has an impact on the entire offensive unit maybe more than any other position and certainly has an impact on how the team is performing,\" Garrett said. \"Sometimes that's fair. Sometimes that's unfair. That's the nature of this position.\"\nCollins will replace Ron Leary at left guard and make his second career start against the Giants. He started in Week 3 against Atlanta while Leary was out with a groin injury. Collins was inactive for the opener and the past two games because he didn't have the position flexibility needed for a backup.\nThe Cowboys signed Collins as an undrafted free agent a few days after the draft. The former LSU player picked Dallas over Miami.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n___\nFollow Schuyler Dixon on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apschuyler\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/news/national/5-must-see-moments-democratic-debate/nn23B/", "https://twitter.com/apschuyler", "http://www.wftv.com/news/news/national/watch-bernie-sanders-says-americans-are-sick-heari/nn2zq/", "http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/national/2-junk-store-find-turns-out-be-5m-billy-kid-photo-/nn24M/", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/14/3c/bc/9fba5b208f6a4971bf31669fd1ea20a8\\u002Dcdd0b38b1b9244c8b06cd728282e193c\\u002D0.jpg", "http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/national/5-things-know-about-lamar-odoms-hospitalization/nn27C/", "http://www.wsoctv.com/news/news/national/watch-snake-snags-drags-catfish-viral-video/nn24q/", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:21:18.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
