She wasn’t molested or otherwise abused. And nobody pushed her in the direction she went.\nBut in her late 30s, a single parent with three kids to support and tired of menial cleaning jobs, she looked for other ways to make money, she says.\n“She had always known men wanted her body, and she liked plenty of sex herself,\" Katina Powell and co-author Dick Cady write in “Breaking Cardinal Rules,” the explosive new book in which she claims she supplied prostitutes and dancers for 22 parties to entertain University of Louisville basketball players and recruits.\n“Now, like waking up to the snap of a hypnotist's fingers, she had a revelation: 'Men not only would pay her for sex, some men were eager to pay, no questions asked.'”\nHow much of what 43-year-old Powell writes about herself is true?\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nU of L book leaves dots yet to be connected\nSportswriters have parsed the text messages, photographs and ledgers the co-authors claim document Powell’s allegation that “a lot of them players went to Louisville because of me.”\nBut what of her own story? The Courier-Journal was able to confirm some of it.\nShe says in the book that she has no criminal record, for example, which court records show is true.\nAnd news accounts confirm another one of her claims — that the father of the second of her three daughters was shot dead in a hail of bullets on Sept. 27, 2008, when the body of 37-year-old Antoine Watts was found at Clay’s Car Wash on Dixie Highway.\nPowell, who has lived in the 800 block of South Shelby Street, did not respond to messages left on her cellphone.\nFor now, the rest of her story must be taken on faith, but she paints herself in such a bad light it is hard to believe she would have made up the observations about herself.\nShe admits, for example, that she pimped her three daughters — the youngest when she was only 15 — and she makes no apologies for it.\n“People may think that I expose my kids,” she writes. “But ----, they enjoy themselves, they meet new people. ... For those who have a problem with it, kiss my ---.”\nHer Facebook profile picture shows her with her blouse unbuttoned and part of her breasts and nipples exposed.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nAmid scandal, Pitino, players focus on hoops\nShe also acknowledges that she let her 16-year-old smoke marijuana on Christmas and supplies all three with weed. “I feel sort of bad that all of us smoke, but worse than that, they are all broke and can’t afford the damn habit.”\nThe book says Powell, who has called herself Bam, Platinum, Ashley, Crystal, Kream, Jazzmine, \"might at one point work with her daughters peddling sex — and take them to church the next day.”\nPowell says her life started innocently enough.\nBorn in 1972, the third-youngest of eight children, she said her mother died but that she was raised by a caring father, whom she doesn’t name but describes as a hard-working foreman for the city parks department.\nShe said she went to St. Columba Catholic School, and as a part of the First Communion ceremony she swore to renounce Satan. In the eighth grade, she played basketball.\nShe said she went to Holy Cross High School and briefly took journalism classes.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nSullivan | U of L fans want answers, need patience\nSt Columba, once Louisville’s biggest Catholic grade school, closed in 1996, and officials couldn’t be reached for comment over the weekend at Holy Cross.\nPowell said she dropped out her junior year when she had the first of three children by different fathers.\nShe said she first worked in the adult entertainment business for Cheetah’s Escort Service, although two former employees of the now-defunct business, including its driver, said Saturday they never heard of her.\nShe writes in the book that at the same time, “she started something she was proud of, a dance troupe that put on sex shows in clubs and at occasional bachelor parties.”\nOver the past few year, she claims, two dozen women have worked with her or for her dancing in clubs, working private parties and as escorts. She said she advertised their services on the Internet, including on Backpage.com.\nHer only problems with the law have come with the Louisville Metro Housing Authority, which three times since 2006, including as recently as last year, moved to evict her from public housing, records show.\nShe describes herself on a business card published in the book as CEO of “Flavors Entertainment,” where the motto is “Bringing Sexy Back.”\nIronically, she says she also now works for a company that requires her to clean bathrooms, kitchens and bedrooms for “college kids” on the U of L campus.\nBut she says she’s proudest of her work as an “entertainer,” as shown in this poem included in the book:\nDear God, for those who know\nI take tremendous pride in doing a show\nA lot of people think that I’m a ho\nAnd these people know exactly where to go\nI do my best to keep it under wrath (sic)\nWill step on anything and anyone who gets in my path.\nCan Katina Powell be prosecuted for promoting prostitution based on the admissions in her book?\nArranging prostitutes for two or more people constitutes a felony. But Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine said Sunday that people can't be prosecuted strictly for what they say — unless they say it under oath.\nHe and defense lawyer Alex Dathorne, a former assistant commonwealth's attorney, said police would have to corroborate the acts, either through business records or the testimony of a prostitute or customer.\n\"Her simply saying so is not enough to prosecute her,\" Wine said.\nHe said it would be up to University of Louisville police, who have declined to comment, to investigate alleged offenses if they occurred on campus.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e50c613cc159a5eef0aa40b060f412a48c882c5a/c=0-69-2206-2275/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Louisville/Louisville/635794964115145629-UofLRedWhite-Pitino2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3faf0c4e341022d95ff4b34e5c0c7d8a44cafa4b/c=0-65-258-323/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Louisville/Louisville/635794900559720767-book-cover.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3596106cfcb20e5913c0f4aba518d68932fc8fbe/c=933-0-3102-2169/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Louisville/Louisville/635794991671494911-RickPitino-solemn-2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:09:34.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
