This is going to be a good challenge. And they're the best defensive team in the league, as well. So we'll be tested at both ends.\"\nSafe to say the Blazers passed the test.\nAllen Crabbe played his best game with the Blazers, Damian Lillard powered through a tough shooting night and the Blazers saw a wide range of contributions from virtually everyone who played. Eleven players scored and nine recorded an assist as the Blazers leaned on their entire roster.\nBut none was better than Crabbe, who finished with 25 points and four assists on 9-for-12 shooting, including 5-of-6 from three-point range. He swished threes, buried pull-up jumpers in transition and nailed midrange shots from all over the court. Crabbe was such a factor, he recorded a ridiculous plus-minus of plus-42. It was the first time he's scored 20 or more points in any pre-or-regular season game with the Blazers.\nAs he scored from everywhere, his teammates followed suit. Lillard recorded 22 points, six rebounds and three assists, shaking off a 3-for-18 shooting night by making 15 free throws. CJ McCollum had 19 points and five assists, Al-Farouq Aminu had 11 points and eight rebounds and Pat Connaughton added 10 points. Every Blazer played less than 29 minutes as Stotts opted to limited minutes.\nThe Blazers started hot and barely cooled. With eight minutes left in the first half, they were shooting 60 percent from the field, including 50 percent from three-point range, and led 50-41. Ten Blazers had played and nine had scored.\nBy game's end, the Blazers shot 44.3 percent from the field and handed out 25 assists on 39 made field goals, as they featured a team-oriented brand of basketball that thrived off of ball-and-player movement and passing.\nThe only thing the Blazers couldn't do was slow the reigning NBA MVP. Stephen Curry finished with 30 points and seven assists in 26 minutes for the Warriors.\nAminu makes debut\nAl-Farouq Aminu, who missed the first exhibition game because his wife Helina was in labor, made his debut in a Blazers uniform Thursday night.\nAnd he wasted little time making an impact.\nDuring his first shift, Aminu, who started at small forward, scored six quick points and appeared confortable and confident alongside his new teammates. He scored a couple easy put-back baskets, twice converting offensive rebounds into dunks or layups. And he added a pretty driving layup, working toward the hoop with his left hand before spinning around his defender at the basket and easily scoring. Later in the first half, he swished a deep rainbow three-pointer.\nAminu finished with 11 points and eight rebounds, making 5 of 9 shots.\nHarkless sits with concussion\nSmall forward Moe Harkless did not play against the Warriors because of a concussion. He suffered the injury Wednesday during practice.\nIt's unclear how long Harkless, who is undergoing the NBA-mandated concussion protocol, will be sidelined. He had a stellar debut for the Blazers during the team's exhibition-opening loss to the Sacramento Kings on Monday, starting in Aminu's absence and finishing with 14 points, six rebounds, two assists and two steals in 24 minutes.\nNext up\nThe Blazers leave Friday for the first trip of the season, a two-game swing through Sacramento and Salt Lake City. The trip opens Saturday with a 7 p.m. meeting at the Kings, then ends Monday with a 6 p.m. matchup at the Utah Jazz.\nâ€” Joe Freeman | jfreeman@oregonian.com | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BlazerFreeman"], "published": "2015-10-09T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:31:41.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
