(Photo: Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nGAINESVILLE, Fla. — Coach Jim McElwain announced Monday Florida Gator redshirt freshman quarterback Will Grier has been suspended indefinitely from the team. \nThe announcement came at a 2:30 p.m. press conference with both McElwain and Grier. He tested positive for over-the-counter supplements, which carries with it an indefinite suspension from the NCAA. \nMcElwain said he was notified of the situation Sunday and the university has plans to appeal the decision. Grier reportedly took the supplement without knowing what was in it and did not check with the team's medical staff beforehand. \nThe coach went on to say that when players take cough medicine they're to check with medical staff. \nGrier spoke at the press conference, admitting that he took the banned supplement and saying that he was very sorry to everyone. \n\"I hope people can learn from my mistake,\" Grier said, just before McElwain came back to the podium. \nMcElwain told the media that he stands by his players. \"We're in this for these young men. We feel for him. We feel his pain.\" \nWhen asked how the football team responded to the news, McElwain said they hugged Grier and told him they appreciated his honesty. \nSophomore Treon Harris is expected to start in Grier's place. McElwain said that Harris has practiced all the same things as Grier. \"Obviously he's got a different skill set,\" McElwain said of Harris. \nGrier has passed for 1,204 yards and 10 TDs with 3 interceptions this season. \nGrier will still practice with the team. \nFlorida has started 6 - 0 (4 - 0 SEC) with Grier behind center. They play LSU this Saturday. \nScenes of college football: Spirited cheerleaders, passionate fans A Miami Hurricanes fan and a Florida State Seminoles fan talk trash in the second quarter of their game at Doak Campbell Stadium.
