Equally fancy, if not more, inside boxes with Quote: s and couplets about life being an exciting journey and the final box with the prized key…yes, trousseau packing is touching a new high, encompassing not only the bride’s wear but covering everything right from gifts for the new family and even honeymoon wear. And, why not, if one is presenting a Mercedes to the groom, the key must go in style too! Have money, will spend…is the single, sprawling mantra for takers of big fat Indian weddings. Each passing season it only adds to the grandeur and every aspect of a wedding gets another luxurious makeover. Trousseau packing is one branch that’s enjoying a new high. And, when people are spending lakhs on gifts, a few thousands on presenting it grandiosely is an accepted norm. So, right from the bride’s dresses to the gifts for the groom and his family are wrapped in fabulously, keeping in mind the theme, the choices of the parties. Puneet Gupta, who has been in the field for couple of years, sees a sea change in his field. “When it started, fancy platters were the best one could find with frills like flowers and bows adoring it,” he says. But not any more. Right from bespoke trunks to themed packs for his and her toiletries, every thing is now taken care of by professionals. “Themes, ornaments, styles, are the keywords today,” shares Puneet, who recently did a wooden cart done in fresh flower decorations with gifts inside. The carved cart could work well as a décor element later. Another top trend in the field is the use of mirrors. The platters with metal carvings has mirror for base, once the gifts are out, the mirrors could be hung on the walls. While the bride’s trousseau has always been talk of the town, and, the ritual of opening the ‘trunk’ in front of the guests at the lama phere has been fortunately done away with, the bride of today carries her stuff in style. “Perfection lies in detailing,” shares Chandigarh-based Malvika Kapoor, who took up to trousseau packing for sheer passion for it. “Whenever I would travel, I would get fancy frills to wrap gifts, but I had never imagined that one day it would lead to a full fledged career,” shares this trousseau packer who works with her cousin Paru Singh. A workshop in Delhi, this duo works with two craftsmen dedicated solely to create decoration pieces. “We don’t use flowers or dainties that are available in the market but create them specially keeping in mind out clients’ tastes. With women being in charge of trousseau department, pleasing patrons doesn’t come easy. So, long sessions are held to work out each and every detail. While largely in North India, the mandate remains magenta and gold, Malvika loves to work with whites and creams and golds. “A large base of Punjabi clientele sticks to sagan ke colours, but I have done some lovely work in pastels too,” adds Malvika. And trust us, the packing doesn’t finish with bigger items but also everything right from cosmetics to toiletries. In fact, designer Puneet Gupta offers bridal lingerie bags and honeymoon kits. Wash & Wear Bags, Mr & Mrs Bags, Smarty Pants Bags and Princess Bride Pouches help one travel in style, keep the used and fresh intimates separately in our water-proof wash and wear pouches making luggage organised, odour-free and clean. “Our specially designed for couples to carry their intimates in style with two section one for our quirky maharanis and the other for our cool maharajas,” offers Puneet. Talking money, you needn’t upset your budget to add some style to your trousseau. If there are just a few pieces for the immediate family, the packers would give you an option starting Rs 5,000. And, if you don’t want to part with your precious jewellery and designer wear, the packers are happy to lend their expert hand at the venue you decide. And, yes, there is no end to the range.
