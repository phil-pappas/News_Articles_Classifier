We want all our weapons on display against Kali Meehan. \n\"It's very important we take care of business in tremendous fashion.\" \nBarry sees this fight as an opportunity to silence some doubters. \n\"People say Joe hasn't had a war yet, hasn't had to dig deep over the last few rounds and had to come back. People say Joe has to start fighting big guys because the current champions are big men. \n\"Kali Meehan presents these challenges. I think this is the right fight at the right time for Joe. \n\"We are taking this very, very seriously. We are fighting a very big, very experienced guy who really has nothing to lose. I'm sure we are going to get the best Kali Meehan has to offer and we have prepared accordingly.\" Ad Feedback \nBarry, who has a long history with Meehan, has nothing but respect for the Australian-based New Zealander. \nHe knows Meehan will use all of his tricks against the fast-handed Parker and will look to utilise his powerful right-hand punch which is seen as a weakness in the younger fighter's defence. \nMeehan has 42 wins from 47 fights in a professional career dating back to 1997. \n\"Kali is a big, strong, physical guy and we expect a big, strong, physical fight. This is a chance for Joe to show he is stronger in the ring.\" \nBarry said the tight schedule added pressure because short turnarounds would limit training. \nThere was also pressure to maintain the growing appreciation for Parker in wider boxing circles. Parker has significant rankings with three major organisations â€“ six at the WBO, 13 at the WBA and 15 at the WBC. \nHe is also up to No 18 with the independent rankings issued by respected website Boxrec. Meehan is at No 28 with them. \nWith an ambitious management team, Parker needs to keep delivering and extend an unbeaten record that now stands at 15 wins, 13 by knockout. There are four belts on the line in this fight. \n\"There is no room for error, no room for an off day, sickness or injury,\" Barry said. \nParker arrives in Auckland from the United States this weekend to acclimatise and round out his training. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:19:28.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
