Comment Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 11:15 PM By Chris Zadorozny Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 11:15 PM IONIA - Just like that, the fall season has come to a close for the Ionia soccer team. Well, not the entire season, but the regular season is now done and they closed out the season at home, on Senior Night. With a team that has six seniors, including the two captains, Ionia did their best to give their seniors a win. It started out well, with a goal just 22 seconds into the game but ended in a 3-1 loss to Fowlerville. “I think it really came down to possession,” said Ionia head coach Ryan Nevins. “We weren’t playing possession. We got on a high right away once we got that quick goal, we were a little too confident, trying to do too much too fast instead of trying to possess the ball and build up the attack.” The lone goal from Ionia (4-9) came off the foot of sophomore Reese Stuart. After a shot from the right side by senior Avery Baylis, the Gladiators keeper came out with a nice stop. That left Stuart wide open in front of the net with the ball and no defenders around. With a 1-0 lead, Ionia had the momentum early. With the confidence they had, Fowlerville quickly tried to reverse that fortune. It was done but not quickly. They slowly started putting pressure on Ionia with more possession. Ionia first had more chances following their goal, for the next 10 minutes or so. Then on Fowlerville’s third shot of the game, it found a way past senior keeper Dylan Spohr. A shot found its way past the left side of Spohr with 14:54 to play in the first half. The teams exchanged chances in the final 10 minutes of the first half before a tied game going into halftime. It only took the first 10 minutes of the second half for Fowlerville to take the lead. On a shot that Spohr originally saved, he couldn’t quite reach the rebound. It came off him and into the feet of a waiting Gladiator. Spohr dove to try and make the save but it was just out of reach and Fowlerville took a 2-1 lead with 30 minutes left in the match. Ionia had some pressure here and there throughout the second half, but Fowlerville controlled much of the action with solid passes, key defensive maneuvers and bringing Ionia out of their game plan. With 3:18 to play, Fowlerville put the icing on the win with a shot that slipped past Spohr for a 3-1 lead and eventual win. “We started (the season) off really rough with a really young team,” said Nevins. “As the season has gone on, we’ve made tremendous progress. We’ve won three out of our last six (games), all three of the losses were against quality teams. With the young team that we have, we can’t be unhappy about the end of the season.” Page 2 of 2 - Joining Spohr and Baylis, Ty Luginbuhl, Ethan Wolbers, Nate LeForge and Tobias Porsti will all be graduating. “They’re a huge part of this team, we’re going to be losing a lot of leadership, a lot of talent,” said Nevins.” It’s going to be hard to replace them.” Ionia will play in the CAAC White Cup sometime next week, but the time and place are currently unknown. They finished their season by honoring Ionia Middle School teacher, Nicole Williams, prior to the game, who has been teaching or 19 years. Follow Sports Editor Chris Zadorozny on Twitter @ZadsISS.
