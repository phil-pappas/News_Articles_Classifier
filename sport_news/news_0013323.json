Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 11:38 pm GIRLS' SOCCER: Dragons preparing for tough regional By GREG MENGELT News and Tribune Posted on Oct 13, 2015 \nSELLERSBURG — Silver Creek is coming off an historic week in which it won its first sectional game ever then followed that feat with its first sectional title in program history. \nThe Dragons don’t believe they’re done adding to the list of firsts in 2015. \nSilver Creek opens its first regional tonight at East Central (18-1) against the host Trojans. The winner gets New Castle (17-1) or Columbus East (9-4-5) in Saturday’s regional title tilt. \n“I’m not happy just to be there,” senior star Olivia Scarbrough said. “All season, I thought we’d be here, honestly. I think we’re a good enough team that we shouldn’t set limits. My goal is state. I think this group of girls is the most talented to ever come through [Silver Creek]. I’m excited for [tonight] and I know we can do it. Am I happy to be there? Absolutely. But I know there’s a lot more left for us.” \n“We’ve kind of talked about not being satisfied,” Silver Creek coach Patrick Anderson said. “I said everything else is icing on the cake, but how big do you want that cake? We don’t want to be happy to just be there. I think the girls really want to win and know what they have to do.” \nOn Thursday, Silver Creek (16-2-1) beat Corydon Central for the third time this season for the program’s first sectional win. On Saturday, they beat host Floyd Central 1-0 on a Scarbrough goal in the 16th minute and the team’s 13th shutout in 19 games. \n“Four long years coming,” Scarbrough said. “Ever since I was a kid, I’ve dreamed about winning something big. When you get to high school, you always dream of winning the sectional championship. You live and dream for it. To finally get it my senior year, it couldn’t have been a better day. It was probably the best day of my life that I got to experience with a group of girls who mean so much to me.” \n“It was sort of surreal,” Anderson said. “It’s been something we’ve been working toward the last couple years and, most importantly, for the last season. We knew we had a team that was going to be capable, so I guess it was just hoping things would fall the right way for everything we turned in. And it turned out that it did.” \nScarbrough’s sectional-winning goal was her team-best 23rd of the season on Jordan Leddon’s second assist of the year. A 2014 News and Tribune Athlete of the Year finalist, Scarbrough deflected the praise for Saturday’s heroics. \n“My teammates helped set it up for me. Luckily I was the one who scored, but if not for my teammates, I wouldn’t be in that situation,” she said. \nSenior defender Becca Elder said the sectional championship has started to sink in over the past couple days. \n“When we won that night, it was kind of like a shock and you don’t get the feeling,” she recalled, “Then you go through the rest of the night and you’re excited an pumped up. We’re still astonished that we won and we’re going to regional. It’s just been a really great feeling.” \nAlthough the team is still buzzing about being sectional championship for the first time, Elder said the team has been focused on East Central and the regional. \n“We’ve been working hard these last couple days to get focused on regionals,” she said. “We’re ready to go up there and play our hardest and do everything we can to win.” \nEast Central enters the regional ranked 15th in Class 2A. The Trojans are 18-1 and are coming off a 1-0 win over Batesville in Saturday’s sectional championship. East Central hasn’t surrendered a goal since a 3-1 win over 2A sectional champion Columbus East on Sept. 26. The tournament host’s only loss came against Harrison (Ohio) — a 3-2 defeat — and it beat Floyd Central 2-0 at the Hoosier Cup. \nThe Trojans own victories over Connersville, Jennings County twice, Batesville twice, Columbus North, Columbus East and South Dearborn. They have won 10 regional titles, including last season when they beat Bloomington South and New Castle en route to the semistate. \n“We know they’re good,” Anderson said. “They’ve only lost one game. They play a little bit tougher schedule than what we play, but I don’t think they’re unbeatable. I think we’ll match up with them pretty well. It’s not like we’re going up against a team we have no chance against.” \nEast Central is led by sophomore Lizzie Kern, who has 13 goals and 15 assists on the season. Junior Lily Heilmeyer has 10 goals and 11 Trojans have scored at least three goals this season. \n“East Central, they’re a great team,” Scarbrough said. “I don’t think necessarily their ranking means anything to us. We know we can handle it. I think we can honestly be an even team going in with them.” \nAnderson said he hopes his team can overcome a sectional-championship hangover. \n“With everything that’s happened, I think it may all just be too overwhelming for them by the time we get there, but I hope it’s not,” he said. “I think we do have a team that can win and maybe even win the regional, win both games. I really feel like we’ve got a good group. It’s just how focused are they going to be.” \nThen, of course, there are obvious tension that comes with a first regional appearance. \n“For sure there’s going to be nerves,” Elder said. “There were nerves in sectionals and I’m sure there will be nerves intensified in regionals, for sure.” \nThe 112-mile trip will be easily the longest the Dragons have made this season, while East Central won’t have to travel and will get to play on its home field. The good news is Anderson’s crew will get to leave early since Silver Creek is on fall break. \n“It’s going to be every bit of two-and-a-half hours,” Anderson said. “We’re going to leave early and stop on the way and eat. That way they can get out and move. We’ll get there for the first [semifinal]. It will be the only chance we get for those two teams to play. I’m not really worried about the drive. Hopefully we’ll be well rested and relaxed since there’s no school.” \nThe Dragons beat Floyd Central on its home turf, but making the long trip and playing a strong East Central team at home may be an even tougher task for Silver Creek. \n“I guess it’s a little bit intimidating because we’ve never been there. We had been to Floyd before,” Elder said. “We go to different tournaments everywhere and play on different fields, so I think we can handle it.” \nNo matter what happens over the next four days, it’s been a season to remember for the Dragons. \n“Very blessed this season to have made it through sectionals the way we have,” Elder said. “To work hard and see your work pay off has really been a blessing.” \n\nCLASS 2A EAST CENTRAL REGIONAL \nWednesday, Oct. 14 \nColumbus East (9-4-5) vs. New Castle (17-1), 5 p.m. \nSilver Creek (16-2-1) at East Central (18-1), 7 p.m. \nSaturday, Oct. 17", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:18:43.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
