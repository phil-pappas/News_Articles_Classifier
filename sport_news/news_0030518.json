Newcomer Reilly Smith celebrated his Panthers' debut with two goals and Vincent Trocheck, a Pennsylvania native, added a goal and three assists for a career-high four-point game.\nThey even threw in some bone-crushing checks, including one from rookie forward Connor Brickley in his NHL debut, who needed about 20 tickets for his Everett, Mass., contingent.\nIf it was a fight the refs should've stopped it after Florida's four-goal barrage, marking the fastest four goals scored in a Panthers home opener of which they are now 12-6-6-2 in, including five wins in their last six. It's also the fastest to four goals in a season opener in NHL history, according to Elias Sports Bureau.\nFlyers goalie Steve Mason didn't know what hit him as he seemed relieved to be yanked by new coach Dave Hakstol after giving up four lamp-lighters on Florida's first eight shots. Mason's career 1.48 goals-against-average in 11 games (7-2-2) against the Panthers took a serious hit.\nActually, the refs should've stopped a fight late in the first period when Panthers 37-year-old enforcer Shawn Thornton -- who may have played his final season opener -- pummeled Flyers center Ryan White with a series of uppercuts.\n\"Who knows it could be my last one? I better make the most of it, drink it in,\" Thornton said after morning skate.\nThe six-goal blowout is the largest goal-differential in a Panthers season-opening and home-opening win, topping their 8-3 pasting of the Bruins to begin the 2006-07 season. The Panthers improved to 11-7-1-2 in season openers, but the Flyers (0-1-1) have a chance for quick revenge against their Eastern Conference rivals with a rematch in their home opener in Wells Fargo Center Monday.\nJust 1:23 after the 19,424 fans were treated to an inspirational pregame video presentation, Trocheck swept in a backhand rebound of a long shot from Jussi Jokinen to ignite the fuse. The Panthers power play, which was ranked 24th last season but began clicking when Jagr came aboard with 21 games left, needed just 18 seconds to make it 2-0 as Nick Bjugstad took a pass from 19-year-old defenseman Aaron Ekblad before wristing it in at 4:55.\nBjugstad, the team's leading goal scorer last season with 24 despite missing the last 10 games due to back surgery, hadn't played a regular-season game since March 21.\nAnother power play came 28 seconds later and this time Florida needed only 21 seconds to make it 3-0 when Smith showed off an artistic wraparound and top-shelf tally at 5:46. Brandon Pirri, who had only two assists and 23 goals last season, matched last season's total of assists as he set up his longtime youth hockey linemate twice.\nOne minute later Jokinen joined the red-light district when Trocheck intercepted Mason's horrendous clearing pass and flicked it toward the vacated net where the newly named alternate captain stuffed it home.\nLast year the Panthers struggled in the second periods, but just 33 seconds in Aleksander Barkov spoon fed Jagr for a one-time slot shot past relief goalie Michal Neuvirth. Jagr's two goals give him 724 career goals and 13 in season openers.\nThe Flyers spoiled Luongo's shutout bid at 3:34 of a chippy second period when defenseman Mark Streit's long slapper from the point snuck through traffic. Smith capped off the historic opener with a one-time, power-play goal (5-on-3) at 7:55 of the third.\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1735859&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1735859", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1735859&h=Panthers%27+quick+start+leads+to+7%2D1+season%2Dopening+rout+of+Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:24:30.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
