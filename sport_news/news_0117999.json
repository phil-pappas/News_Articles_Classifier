Photo: Jeff Huehn /UTSA Athletics Image 25 of 25 Lynn Hickey: Coker will coach at UTSA through 2018 season 1 / 25 Back to Gallery SAN ANTONIO — Claiming that Larry Coker will coach the UTSA Roadrunners at least through the 2018 football season, athletic director Lynn Hickey late Wednesday night emphatically denied a published report that suggested a change could be in the works.\n\"No, there's no credence to that,\" Hickey said.\nAppearing at a North West side restaurant for the weekly UTSA coach's show, Coker declined to comment on the article published Monday on the GridironNow.com website.\nRELATED: Return of Sanchez expected to boost UTSA defense\n\"No, I haven't seen it at all,\" Coker said. \"That's low on my interest scale right now. It's totally speculative. There's nothing to be said about it.\"\nIn contrast, Hickey spoke at length, praising the coach's performance since his hiring in 2009 and lamenting the seemingly constant pressure in college athletics to make changes.\n\"If there's something wrong with athletics sometimes, it's people get so caught up in not giving really good coaching and staffs an opportunity to build, and they make rash decisions,\" Hickey said. \"I mean, I can't even imagine who we could bring in here to replace someone that would give us the stature, the quality of coaching and the visibility that Larry Coker does.\"\nHired in 2009 to build the football program from scratch, Coker received in August of 2014 a five-year contract extension running through the 2018 season.\nWith a 24-28 record in a little more than four seasons, UTSA has started out 1-5 this fall, playing a rigorous non-conference schedule with a young team plagued by injuries.\nAsked if Coker would be the coach next year, Hickey said, \"Coach will be the coach next year, and the year after that and the year after that, OK?\"\nRELATED: UTSA's Wheeler: We've got to 'pull through' in crunch time\nDuring the last contract talks, Hickey tried to get Coker to agree to a seven-year extension.\n\"I offered him seven (years) and he said, 'Let's go with five,' \" Hickey said. \"So, you know, we can always re-up that.\"\nCoker, who led Miami to the 2001 national title, turned 67 in June. UTSA plays a Conference USA West Division game this weekend against Southern Miss at Hattiesburg, Mississippi.\nHickey equated the team's 5-13 record since 2014 to a down cycle in a start-up business.\nAt the same time, she said the effectiveness of personnel on Coker's coaching staff was on display last week in the second half of a 34-31 loss at home to Louisiana Tech.\n\"Sometimes, in building a program and building a business, you're going to have some highs and lows,\" Hickey said. \"The key to me, the biggest key, is how those kids came back (in) the second half the other day.\n\"If this was a poor situation, coaching wise, they would not have come back and played even better in the second half. They did not give up. When you see that you know that they have leadership that is genuine and very effective.\"\nHouston-based UTSA booster Pat Clynes said in a telephone interview that he is optimistic about the team this year. But even if it finishes 1-11, he said he thinks Coker will continue to lead the Roadrunners.\n\"Even if they went 1-11, he's not going anywhere,\" Clynes said. \"You know, he's not going anywhere and most of us boosters — I can't speak for everybody — we're not going anywhere, either.\"\nUTSA started athletics in 1981 and Clynes started his support in 1990.\n\"We waited a long time to get football and it has exceeded every expectation of mine, from the conference to everything else, and I am not going anywhere,\" he said.\njbriggs@express-news.net\nTwitter: @JerryBriggs", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/05/46/8673669/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/06/8700291/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/06/8700290/19/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772643/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/70/77/8622064/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772647/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772644/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772650/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772646/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/46/8784296/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/05/8700286/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772639/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/06/8700290/19/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772645/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/74/21/8635512/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/01/8699984/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772639/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/76/8765352/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/10/34/8685329/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/74/21/8635512/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/46/8784296/3/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/JerryBriggs", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772642/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/46/8784294/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772648/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/05/46/8673669/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/70/77/8622064/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/06/8700291/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772651/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/01/8699984/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772640/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772651/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/76/8765352/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/70/77/8622062/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772647/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772648/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772643/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/46/8784294/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772646/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772644/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772642/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/14/05/8700286/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772650/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772649/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772645/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772649/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/70/77/8622062/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/60/8772640/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/10/34/8685329/9/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:16:57.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
