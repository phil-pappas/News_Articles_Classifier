Johnson has a strained medial collateral ligament. \nScratched for the Eagles are QB Thad Lewis, RB Kenjon Barner, CB Denzel Rice, LBs Kiki Alonso and Mychal Kendricks, G Julian Vandervelde and defensive end Brandon Bair. \nInactive for the saints are P Thomas Morstead, QB Garrett Grayson, DEs Obum Gwacham and Bobby Richardson, T Terron Armstead, FB Austin Johnson and G Jahri Evans. \nEvans, a Philadelphia native and former Bloomsburg University star, could be the Saints' best offensive lineman, but he remains out with an injury, along with Morstead, which forced the Saints to sign a second punter, Brandon Fields, two weeks ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:42:58.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
