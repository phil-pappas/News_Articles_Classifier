(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones analyzes Dominique Hawkins' injury. \nYou may have heard that Dominique Hawkins broke his hand in practice, and he'll be out for the next four to five weeks. Now, it's not the worst injury. It's on his shooting hand, but it's the kind of thing you can recover from. \nHere's why it disappoints me so much. I've been hearing that Dominique Hawkins has been playing great this summer and fall, and people close to the team tell me he's improved as much as anybody on the team, and a lot of folks think he was working his way onto the rotation. \nI love Dominique Hawkins. He's a great kid, and there's no one who works harder. But the last few years he's been on a couple of teams that have been so good, he really hasn't gotten to play. \nBut this year, there was an opening. Because of his defense, I think he could see the court. And if the season started in the next couple of weeks, he would have been playing quite a bit. \nNow he'll be falling behind a little bit. He's going to miss all the practice leading up to the season. And he won't be ready until basically right before the season starts. \nI think Dominique can work his way back into the rotation. And when the game starts, he can play. But once again, he'll be behind and he'll have to try to make up some distance. I hate that for the kid. He's really good and he was about to be there where he could play. \nI'm Matt Jones, and this has been Overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:46:54.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
