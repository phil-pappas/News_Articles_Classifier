Though everyone is tightlipped about what transpired in the meeting, there are reports that Makkar assured the jathedar that the SGPC stood by him in this difficult phase. The duo met at the jathedar’s residence in the afternoon. The meeting lasted for about half an hour. Makkar was accompanied by SGPC secretary Manjeet Singh and Darbar Sahib Manager Partap Singh. While Makkar and Giani Gurbachan Singh could not be contacted, the jathedar’s personal assistant Jaswinderpal Singh said Makkar assured the jathedar that SGPC, DSGMC, Nihang Singh organisations and other outfits supported his decision. He said the two leaders discussed the current scenario, though he declined to share the details. Meanwhile, sources close to the Akal Takht said the panel, regarding which an announcement was made yesterday, would look into various issues, including the pardon row, and it would be constituted within a week. Giani Gurbachan Singh had announced the setting up of this panel last evening, but he had not clarified whether it would address the pardon row or Sikh issues in the future. In another development, security has been beefed up outside the Akal Takht Secretariat. A metal detector has been set up. The security cover for the Akal Takht Jathedar has also been increased. On the other hand, the Global Sikh Council has condemned the decision of “politically appointed jathedars” to exonerate dera chief, while stating that they “have no authority to dictate to, or act on behalf of, the wider Sikh community”. Similarly, a meeting of Nihang Singh organisations, led by Shiromani Panth Akali Budha Dal (Panjwa Takht) Jathedar Baba Balveer Singh was held here today. These organisations also appealed the Sikh high priests to review their decision to grant pardon to Dera Sacha Sauda chief.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:14:11.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
