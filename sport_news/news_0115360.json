That’s when a little-known, redshirt freshman quarterback by the name of Ricky Santos emerged from the bench and engineered a 24-21 upset of preseason No. 1 and defending national champion Delaware in the 2004 season opener at Delaware Stadium. The win ultimately led to the first of 11 straight appearances in the NCAA playoffs for UNH. “A lot of people put in a lot of good work to do what we did,” said coach Sean McDonnell. “It’s a great accomplishment, but it doesn’t mean anything until you get to November.” The postseason streak could also be in jeopardy if the Wildcats don’t get something going over the last five games of the regular season. After struggling against the run in last week’s loss at William & Mary, the Wildcats must now face the No. 2 rushing offense in the Colonial Athletic Association on Saturday (3:30 p.m.) at Delaware Stadium. The Blue Hens are averaging 244 yards per game rushing to rank 12th nationally; UNH ranks next-to-last in the CAA against the run after giving up 325 yards and four touchdowns on the ground last week. “We’re really working on everyone doing their job,” said junior linebacker Kevin McNally. “Last week we had some missed tackles too. Everyone has to do their job and we should be fine this week.” The Wildcats left too many points on the field against William & Mary to overcome their deficiencies on defense. They dropped a sure touchdown pass on the last play of the first half, missed a 22-yard field goal attempt on their first possession of the third quarter, fumbled a punt snap and had another punt blocked. “It was a disappointing loss,” said receiver Aaron Lewis-Cenales, “but we bounced back on Sunday practice. We had a lot of energy at practice, and we just need to convert that to the rest of the week.” UNH is 3-3 overall and 1-2 in the CAA with five games left. The Wildcats are 2-0 this season after a loss and 1-3 overall on the road. They are 2-0 at home where they will play three of their last four games. “Coach Mac has been talking all week about winning the day,” McNally said, “and taking it one day at a time and trying to win every day leading up to Delaware, and not looking at the past or the future, just winning the day.” UNH will be playing at the same venue where McDonnell made his collegiate debut as a player in 1974. None of the current Wildcats have ever played there. The teams last met there in 2010 in the quarterfinals of the FCS playoffs with Delaware prevailing, 16-3. The last meeting during the regular season came in 2006 when Santos — now the receivers coach at UNH— and the Wildcats outlasted the Blue Hens and future NFL quarterback Joe Flacco, 52-49. “I played my first big-time college football game at Delaware Stadium,” McDonnell said. “I went in and played when somebody got hurt. I’ll never forget that.” UNH has won five of the last six games against Delaware (2-4, 1-2 CAA), which was off last week after getting shut out, 20-0, by Rhode Island. The Blue Hens’ have lost three of their last four games with their only CAA win coming against William & Mary, 24-23, on Oct. 3. “Five one-week seasons,” McDonnell said. “We can’t think about anything else. We’ve got to think about how we can win this football game this week.” By Al Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:49:54.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
