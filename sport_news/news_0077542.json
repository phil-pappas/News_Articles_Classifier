Unlike in past Patriots-Colts games, when New England went ground-and-pound, the Patriots threw on eight of 10 plays in this drive, with Brady completing six of his throws for 69 yards. One of the running plays was a patented Brady quarterback sneak to pick up a first down on a third-and-one play. Brady found Julian Edelman in the end zone from 12 yards out to tie the score. Colts jump out to 7-0 lead on long opening drive Andrew Luck got off to a terrific start in his first game back after two weeks off, driving the Indianapolis Colts 89 yards on the game's opening drive to give the Colts an early 7-0 lead on the New England Patriots. Luck ended the drive by lobbing a beautiful, five-yard touchdown pass on a over Malcolm Butler to Donte Moncrief, who just barely managed to stay inbounds and hold on to the ball while falling to the turf. The play came on fourth-and-one, as head coach Chuck Pagano rolled the dice after the Colts had failed to convert on a third-down attempt. Luck was 8-of-9 for 62 yards on the drive, which took more than half the first quarter. Frank Gore contributed a big 23-yard carry.
