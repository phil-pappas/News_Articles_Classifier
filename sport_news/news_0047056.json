Senior quarterback Joey Dubovy passed for two touchdowns and Christian Olivieri caught one TD and returned a punt for another to lead the visiting Pirates (1-3, 1-1 South Shore League Small) to a rain-soaked 36-6 win over the Sharks (2-2, 0-1 SSL Small) Friday night at Monomoy’s Athletic Complex. “We played them tough in the first half until a big punt return and a fumbled punt that led to another score,” said Monomoy coach Ross Jatkola. “Hull is a good, veteran football team with size and speed, but our kids gave everything they had.” Hull recovered an onside kick on the opening kickoff, but the Sharks’ defense held tough and stopped the visitors on fourth down deep inside their own territory. Jake Wisniewski flipped field position for Monomoy with a 67-yard punt toward the end of the first period. The Pirates drew first blood midway through the second quarter when the speedy Olivieri hauled in a punt and raced 62 yards down the left sideline. A two-point conversion pass from Dubovy to tight end Adam Foster gave the visitors an 8-0 lead. Hull took advantage of a fumbled snap inside the Monomoy-20 and Dubovy hit Olivieri for a 16-yard scoring pass to make it 14-0 at halftime. The visitors poured it on in the third quarter with three unanswered touchdowns. Tom Harrigan got things started on the opening drive when he raced around right end for a 22-yard TD and a Dubovy kick made it 21-0. A 28-yard scoring pass from Dubovy to Tyler Ball and a conversion pass from Dubovy to Foster gave the Pirates a 29-0 advantage and a six-run run by Fern Berry and another Dubovy kick gave Hull a commanding 36-0 advantage. The Sharks finished strong with a scoring drive early in the fourth quarter, capped by a 24-yard touchdown run by Drew Senatore, who is playing with an injured thumb. Led by the linebacking duo of Barry and Pat Richardson, the Pirates shut down the brother backfield combination of Charles and Nathan Amaker most of the game. “Our defense led the way for us, especially in the first half before our offense got untracked,” said Hull coach Jerry McGrath. “We took advantage of a couple big plays in the kicking game and then came out strong in the second half.” Devin Lopes played a strong game on both sides of the ball for Monomoy, while Barry was all over the field for the Pirates.
