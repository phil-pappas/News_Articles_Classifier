The point, Patterson said Tuesday, is that freshmen face many challenges adjusting to college football, from preparation to high-stakes games to coaching feedback to a new opponent in the span of a few days. From a coaching standpoint, seniors handle it a lot better than freshmen and sophomores, Patterson said.\nThat same look of confusion is unavoidable thanks to injuries and departures that have produced a makeshift defense. Even with the return of senior defensive tackle Davion Pierson from a concussion, TCU is down six probable defensive starters from preseason camp. Fourteen defensive players have made their first starts this season.\nEven Texas coach Charlie Strong offered sympathy with the Longhorns (1-3) scheduled to visit Fort Worth on Saturday.\n\"If we were to miss six defensive starters, we'd really be in trouble,\" Strong said. \"There's no way.\"\nTCU (4-0) ranks an uncharacteristic 81st nationally in total defense (405.8 yards per game) and is tied for 86th in scoring defense (28.3 points a game). After 27 consecutive games with a takeaway, TCU has gone two consecutive games without forcing a turnover.\n\"Some years, you kind of shake your head,\" Patterson said. \"We have to keep plugging them in, and they have to keep getting better.\"\nCase in point: linebackers Montrel Wilson and Travin Howard, each thrust into starting roles that neither expected. Wilson is a freshman; Howard is a sophomore and a converted safety. Each had their moments in a 55-52 win over Texas Tech and each struggled at times, Patterson said.\nPatterson really doesn't want to dwell on the defensive issue. For one, it doesn't help him get stops and win games. If he makes it an issue, how do all those fresh faces react?\n\"I don't really talk about it,\" Patterson said. \"If you start thinking about it, they start thinking about it. And I'm sure they already think about it.\"\nPatterson acknowledges that he's made concessions to the injuries and inexperience, keeping things simple and not taking chances. He even offered a stat that TCU has blitzed less than any team in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Patterson also wondered if he needs to give his defense better calls in key situations.\nHe acknowledged that TCU broadened the playbook against Tech.\nHe's also counting on the few seniors he has on defense. Patterson noted that Pierson hit a high frustration level after the game.\nPatterson's advice to Pierson? \"Now you're the senior, now you're the guy that supposed to grow these guys up,\" Patterson said. \"You're supposed to be the guy who leads them.\"\nNo matter what people say, Patterson realizes that TCU is viewed as vulnerable on defense. While the No. 4 national ranking ensures everybody's best shot, the defense fuels upset hopes.\nHe is taking the longer view.\n\"I don't have to be the best football team I need to be right now,\" Patterson said. \"I just have to be that best team by the end of the season.\"\nBreaking down the TCU defense:\nCategory Stat Starters lost to injury/personal leave Six Players making their first start 14 Returning linebacker starts 0 National rank, total defense 81st Big 12 rank, total defense Seventh\nFollow Chuck Carlton on Twitter at @ChuckCarltonDMN .\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN", "https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-30T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:09:50.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
