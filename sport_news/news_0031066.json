For if anything, the Cowboys do deserve respect, not much, but some.\nYes, there’s always something about the Cowboys, mainly because, love him or not, the team owner always keeps his ’Boys in the news, somehow, someway. Jones likes to talk, and when has that ever kept him out of trouble.\nAnd with the Hate-triots coming to town on Sunday, you can bet your Roger Staubach autographed jersey that Jones will be cursing and cussing and reliving the glory days of America’s Former Team, whose glory now consists of winning a playoff game every few years or so. Happy they will be with that. (During the Bill Belichick and Tom Brady era, Jones’ ’Boys have lost eight of their last 10 playoff games and not advanced beyond the divisional round since last winning it all in 1995. But who really cares!)\nAnd there is something about the Cowboys. Even with half their lineup out injured and a couple of derelicts ambling back from league suspensions, America’s Former Team will be ready for the Hate-triots. Jones simply doesn’t like looking up from down below with the NFL dregs he now hangs out with, and what a chance to get his team some notoriety once again.\nBeat the Pats, the whole league rejoices!\nYes, there is still something about the Cowboys, once legendary now ordinary, that in their time were always the team everybody loved to beat.\nNow in every NFL city, there’s no doubt who that is — it’s the Hate-riots.\nJerry Jones understands.\nUndeflatable:\nPatriots (-8 ) at Dallas — This was going to be a big game, it still is, except only one team will play big. Pats, 34-17 .\nDiscover America:\nJacksonville at Tampa Bay (-3) — The loser in this Florida Bowl relinquishes all its free passes to Disney World forever. Buccaneers, 17-12 .\nBuffalo (-2 ) at Tennessee — The over/under for Bills penalties is 43. The over/under for coach Rex Ryan saying something sane is 0. And they somehow win. Bills, 24-16 .\nCleveland at Baltimore (-7 ) — Gimme a reason to pick the Browns. Anything Raven-ous will do. Ravens, 27-13 .\nWashington at Atlanta (-7) — Enjoy the first-place experience Redskins. The feeling will wear away quickly. Falcons, 34-13 .\nChicago at Kansas City (- 8 1 ⁄ 2 ) — The lone hope for football fans in these towns is that their baseball teams meet in the World Series. Chiefs, 28-24 .\nNew Orleans at Philadelphia (-5 1 ⁄ 2 ) — Just keep it rolling straight downhill, Eagles. And faster, will ya. Saints, 30-27 .\nSt. Louis at Green Bay (-8 1 ⁄ 2 ) — The Rams came up so big in knocking off unbeaten Arizona last week they actually think they can beat another unbeaten. Nope. Packers, 36-16 .\nSeattle at Cincinnati (-3) — Are the Bengals for real? Get real! Seahawks, 24-17 .\nArizona (-2 1 ⁄ 2 ) at Detroit — The poor Lions got jobbed by the refs in Seattle. (A Ted Wells investigation gets underway shortly.) But simply, bad things happen to bad teams. Cardinals, 19-14 .\nDenver (-4 1 ⁄ 2 ) at Oakland — OK, Raiders, you want to show that respectability is back in your Black Hole of a dungeon, do it Sunday. Raiders, 20-17 .\nSan Francisco at N.Y. Giants (-7) — Does anyone feel sorry for the Niners, who lead all sports in off-field incidents, on-field incompetence and general mayhem? Giants, 27-10 .\nPittsburgh at San Diego (-3) — He doesn’t have his main man in quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and Mike Tomlin doesn’t have his mind either. Chargers, 30-20 .\nLast week: 6-9-0.\nSeason: 29-33-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:59:06.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
