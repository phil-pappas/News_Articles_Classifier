Browning was hurt a few plays before the touchdown pass.\n“That was probably one time he didn’t need to escape out of the pocket. We had somebody open who he was trying to find, he just couldn’t see him. And so he flushed out of there and got knocked to the turf,” Petersen said. “Maybe down the road, he does find that guy, but he does a great job of finding guys. Things like that are going to happen.”\nWhen Washington got the ball back with 1:11 remaining, K.J. Carta-Samuels (a Bellarmine Prep alum) was at quarterback while Browning was on the sideline. Petersen said after the game that he didn’t believe it was a significant injury but did not elaborate Monday.\nStanford schedule : Stanford’s game at Washington State will have a 7:30 p.m. kickoff Oct. 31 and will air on ESPN.\nAlso, Stanford announced that it will host Rice on Nov. 26, 2016, a game that originally was to have been Sept. 3, 2016.\nThe Cardinal’s 2016 season opener instead will be Sept. 2 against visiting Kansas State, which Stanford will face on the road Sept. 4, 2021.\nUtes’ tight end out: Utah starting tight end Siale Fakailoatonga is out for the season after being injured in the 34-18 win against Arizona State on Saturday.\nThe third-ranked Utes (6-0) play at USC on Saturday.\nFakailoatonga started the past five games after Evan Moeai was lost for season in the opener.\nWatts-Jackson released : Michigan State defensive back Jalen Watts-Jackson was released from the hospital Monday, a day after he had surgery on a hip he injured while scoring the winning touchdown against Michigan.\nWatts-Jackson came up with a fumble on the final play and returned it 38 yards to give the Spartans a 27-23 win Saturday.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:28:20.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
