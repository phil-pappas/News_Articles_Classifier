Hardin was able to handle the extra-point duties against the Tigers once Powell went down. Now that both kickers on the roster are hurt, though, the team is looking for a healthy leg.\nOn Monday, the Gators announced they would be holding open tryouts for anyone interested in walking on as a kicker:\nAll Call for Kickers! #Gators are looking for walk-on kickers. Visit the football office today by 4:30 PM to sign up for a tryout.\n— Gator Recruiting (@_Gators_) October 19, 2015 In case somebody random was thinking about trying out, there are some requirements:\n. @_Gators_ See steps before getting cleared to tryout by Compliance. Will receive the form from @GatorsFB . pic.twitter.com/iWzqb3ZU4O\n— GatorZone Compliance (@GatorCompliance) October 19, 2015 Imagine waking up as a student and then going to bed as a member of a Top 25 team. That'd be a wild turn of events.\nThe Gators don't play again until Oct. 31, so they have some time to get their kicking situation together.\n[Twitter]\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/_Gators_/status/656112091854675968", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/13745032/austin-hardin-florida-gators-kicker-tennessee-volunteers-leg-injury", "http://bleacherreport.com/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gators?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/GatorsFB", "http://t.co/iWzqb3ZU4O", "https://twitter.com/GatorCompliance/status/656130861230891008", "https://twitter.com/_Gators_", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:44:16.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
