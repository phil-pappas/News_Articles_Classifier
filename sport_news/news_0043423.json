(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) \nThe Redskins’ secondary will face perhaps its toughest task of the young season on Sunday when Washington visits 4-0 Atlanta, home of the NFL’s leading receiver, Julio Jones, and a familiar face who is off to the best start of his career. \nLeonard Hankerson signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Falcons in the offseason, reuniting the Redskins’ 2011 third-round pick with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan. Hankerson, who only appeared in one game last year, had 81 catches and six touchdowns over four injury-riddled seasons in Washington. He has 17 catches and two touchdowns this season. \nMight he be extra motivated to add to those totals against his former team? \n“Just another game, man,” Hankerson told 106.7 The Fan’s Chris Russell on Wednesday . “I moved on. It’s something you have to do. You can’t dwell on the past. I played for the Redskins for four years, but hey, that’s the past. I’m a Falcon now and it’s just another game, another team that’s in our way, that’s trying to stop us from reaching our goals.” \n[ Rookie receiver Jamison Crowder already paying off on third down ] \nHankerson, who has displaced Roddy White as Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan’s second option in the passing game through four games, said staying healthy has been the biggest key to his modest success in Atlanta. \n“In my past, I had the knee surgery, I had the hip surgery, and it kind of derailed me a little,” Hankerson said. “But if you stay healthy in this game, it can take you a long ways because you can do a whole lots of things. Nobody knows about you if you’re not on the field. So you know, just being here doing what I’m capable of and making plays like I know I can.” \nHankerson also credited his familiarity with Shanahan. \n“It makes the transition a whole lot easier and it was part of my reason [for] coming here,” Hankerson said. “The offense, Kyle Shanahan, [offensive assistant] Mike McDaniel, and you know, it just couldn’t be a better situation for me.” \n[ Five questions for the Redskins as they prepare to face the Falcons ] \nHankerson described Jones, who has 478 receiving yards and four tochdowns, as a “monster” and “one of the top players” he’s been around. Russell asked Hankerson whether he feels like he was given a fair shot when he looks back on his time with the Redskins. \n“I really don’t know,” Hankerson said. “Maybe it wasn’t the right timing, maybe it was me. What can you do, you know? I’m just looking forward to being here with the Falcons, doing my job, doing the best that I can do. We’re off to a hot start right now and we’re trying to keep that going.” \nListen to the full interview here . Scott Allen writes about all things D.C. sports.
