Jackson claimed the sectional championship last week. It was somehow fitting that GlenOak emerged triumphant after Tuesday’s district championship at The Legends of Massillon, with all three Federal League schools qualifying for the state tournament. Freshman Jessica Hahn matched the low score with a 73; sisters Danielle and Lexus Roshong shot 80 and 78, respectively; and Nikki Athans and Brianna Adcock made huge contributions down the stretch as the Golden Eagles to finish at 318. A clutch bogey putt by Athans on her last hole tied GlenOak for first place with Avon, and the Eagles won it by a stroke on Adcock’s 97 as the No. 5 tiebreaker. “I’m just so proud of my team,” Hahn said after her 37-36 was one of four 73s on the day. “Everyone pulled through. It was just a really good day. “We just went in thinking we were going to make it out. So, we were really positive and we all believed in each other.” “First time as a team (qualifying) for districts, first time ever for us as a team to go to state,” said GlenOak head coach Linda Kubilus. “It’s pretty amazing.” Kubilus admitted she didn’t know much about Avon, the Sweetbriar sectional winner. But Avon wasn’t her primary concern. “I knew we were good,” the sixth-year head coach said. “I knew the teams we had to beat were Green and Jackson because of the Federal League. They are always strong.” Her advice to her team? “I told them there were going to be a lot of good teams there,” said Kubilus. “We have to play with heart and determination and remember that every stroke counts. And they did. It was awesome.” The depth of talent on the team side was unmatched. The five teams that qualified for Columbus — GlenOak, Avon, Green, Jackson and Dover — were all within six strokes of each other. Dover’s 324 total was 15 strokes lower than the average fifth-place over the past four years. That left both Jackson, at 323, and Green, with 321, sweating in the chilly, raw conditions until the final score was posted. “I told you!” Jackson head coach Teal Harvey said after his team had secured its eighth straight state berth. “This was the best (district) tournament I’ve seen.” Harvey’s girls shot 318 to win the Turkeyfoot sectional. They shot 310 at the Legends last year to win the district on their way to a runner-up finish in Columbus. But a 166 on the front side had Jackson in danger of not advancing. Page 2 of 2 - The Polar Bears’ Hannah Lemons, Lauren Dauk, Amelia Stefan and Lauren Hatfield responded by shooting 157 on the back. Stefan sliced five strokes off her front side score, and both Dauk and Hatfield cut three strokes for Jackson to move on. “I could’ve done better. Luckily, I didn’t have to do better,” Lemons said after her 37-39—76 led Jackson. “Luckily my team made it, and I’m happy for us. I was worried ... we were a mess inside, waiting so long (for the final scores).” Nobody’s insides were more twisted than Green head coach Jake Shocklee. After two agonizing near-misses, his girls earned their first trip to state as Abbie Pearce fired a 73 and was backed by Brooke Babbin (81), Michelle Lori (82) and Madison Jackson (85). “Two years ago, we missed by two strokes; last year, we missed by one stroke,” Shocklee said. “I can’t be more proud of the way the girls played and the way they held in there. “I felt like not only were we playing against the Legends, we were playing like demons. Is this meant to be? “Today, the positive things happened.” The quality team scores also carried over to the low individual numbers. Too much so for Hoover freshman Maddie Ardelean. Despite carding an 37-39—76, she was unable to advance as an individual as four girls who were not members of qualifying teams shot 74 to reach state.
