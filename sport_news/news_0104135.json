In addition to having the ace make two starts, not including Game 6 of the ALCS which he's set to start Friday night, the Jays brought Price in to relieve for three innings in Game 4 of the ALDS, and have had him warm up during other postseason games without bringing him in. \nHaha media is funny..never said I was mad or upset about anything that's gone on in the playoffs!! And stop twisting my words around..cheers â€” David Price (@DAVIDprice14) October 22, 2015 \nPrice also conceded later he has something to prove in Game 6, because he has yet to win a postseason start in his career. \n\"I guess I have to prove that I can pitch at this point in the season in the playoffs,\" Price said at a press conference at Kauffman Stadium before an informal team workout. \"I get that. But I don't have to go out there and prove that I'm a good pitcher. I think I've done that over the seven years of my career. \n\"So I'm just going to go out there, throw my game, have fun, have good things happen, get good results and good things are going to happen, I know they are.\" \nPrice also was peppered with questions about how Toronto has used him between starts. \nThe Giants used ace Madison Bumgarner in relief in the World Series in 2014, but it was in Game 7 when they had a chance to put away the Royals , and had no more games to play. Price still has had games to start, plus a side routine between those outings. It's been an unusual, but not necessarily unprecedented, way for an ace like Price to be used, and Toronto's methods have brought questions from some media, fans and industry experts. \nOne big reason for all of the questions: Price's career postseason record. He has a 5.65 ERA over his past eight postseason appearances, covering eight starts, and his teams are 1-7 in those games. Price himself has never been credited with a postseason victory, something of which he's very much aware. Price said as much in follow-up comments before an informal team workout at Kauffman Stadium. \n\"I know what I'm capable of doing, I think everybody in this room knows what I'm capable of doing. And I think I just kind of [have wanted] to do it too badly,\" Price said. \"And it's been long overdue for me to get a win as a starter in the playoffs. And I'll be ready to change that story tomorrow.\" \n(USATSI) \nLike in his tweet, Price also came off as chill about the ways and means of Jays manager John Gibbons, but in a column by Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports , he was presented as a ballplayer biting his tongue for not wanting to rock the boat. \nIt's not even like that, Price said. The game situations, along with Toronto's left-handers in the bullpen -- Brett Cecil is hurt and Aaron Loup hasn't always been available to pitch -- have dictated that he be ready in a pinch. \n\"I'm not upset with how things have transpired throughout the playoffs,\" Price said. \"The situation that we've been in, we're a man down in the pen, especially with Cecil going down, being our main left-handed pitcher out there. Then Loupy, whatever is going on with him right now. So we don't have a lefty in the pen.\"And I understand that -- I get it, and at this point in the season you've got to be ready for whatever. I mean, if I would have gotten in that game yesterday, I'm sure Stroman might have pitched Game 6 and I'd be ready for Game 7. I didn't see it to be a big deal.\" \nGibbons said Price has presented himself as up for whatever the Jays think they need -- even that it was Price's own idea to pitch in relief. Price had done it before. When he was a rookie in 2008 with the Rays, Price came out of the bullpen on five occasions during the postseason. But the Rays weren't counting on him to start at that point. \n\"We didn't have to sell it to him one bit,\" Gibbons said. \"Actually, he came and said, 'I can pitch out of the pen today.' It wasn't like we were holding a gun to his head. He was for it. He's done it before. It goes back a ways, of course. \n\"But the circumstances, do or die games, he was available. Dave's the ultimate team guy. He's here to win. That's what drives him.\" \nPrice conceded that he understood why his relief appearance against Texas, along with a long warmup session the game before, would raise eyebrows.\"Texas might have been a little bit weird, but we've definitely moved past that,\" Price said. \"There's good communication; they definitely keep me in the loop with what could happen, the type of situation that I could be in the game, and I'm open for that. \nAnd right now, all he has to worry about is Game 6. \n\"We've got to win. We all know that,\" Price said. \"This is the same situation we were in against Texas in the division series. So this team does a really good job of focusing in on the task at hand, and that's the game tomorrow. We don't look ahead to Game 7. We're not talking about Game 5 in the clubhouse. Everybody has forgotten that game. It was a very good win for us. But we've moved on.\"And that's what this team has done an extremely good job of ever since I've been here. It's been pretty impressive.\" \nPrice has a 5.24 ERA in 13 career postseason appearances.
