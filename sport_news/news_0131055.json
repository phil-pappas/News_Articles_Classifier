The meetings are the same ones the team holds every Monday, but they arrived on this day with added urgency due to the Seahawks’ sudden slide in the standings and the fact that they have little time to wallow in the mire with a game Thursday at San Francisco. “Today is a big day for us,’’ Thomas said. Thomas, though, seemed to predict that the results of the meeting and any introspection would be positive. “Man, this is great, really,’’ he said when asked about the challenge confronting the Seahawks. “It’s a part of the story. So we’re going to outlast this. This is why we are in this position in the first place, this is why we are the best, these situations. They are not going to break us.’’ Shortly before Thomas spoke, coach Pete Carroll held his usual Monday news conference, though in most unusual circumstances, with the Seahawks at two games under .500 this deep into the season for the first time since 2011 (they also began this season 0-2). Carroll said he couldn’t recall a similar circumstance in which he had a team he thought was this good not get results on the field. Though he said “it could be’’ a challenge to make sure the Seahawks don’t break apart he added that, “It’s a legitimate challenge. I don’t know what kind. It’s a legitimate challenge. I see it that way. “I see every day like that. Every day is a challenge to be right and be on it. To help guys do better and do what they’re capable of doing. So this falls in line with that mentality. This is adversity. … This is what that it is, and we’ll see how that goes. It’s not about what happened, it’s about what you do with it.” Most perplexing to Carroll are the Seahawks’ inability to win games in which they win the turnover ratio — they are 0-3 this year when forcing more turnovers than their opponent — and the fourth-quarter breakdowns. The Seahawks have allowed 125 points this season — 55 in the fourth quarter. The previous three years, they allowed 67, 60 and 68 total points in the fourth quarter. On Sunday it again was a big performance by a quarterback that led to the collapse, as Carolina’s Cam Newton completed 12 of 15 passes (including one spike to stop the clock) for 162 yards and a touchdown. Quarterbacks have completed 49 of 59 passes in the fourth quarter for 582 yards and four touchdowns against the Seahawks defense. In the rest of the games, they are 77 of 133 for 830 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions. The Seahawks offense has been similarly absent in most fourth quarters. They have scored just nine total points in the fourth quarters of the past five games. The collapse against Carolina was accentuated by Seattle’s miscommunication on the Panthers’ final touchdown, a 26-yard pass from Newton to tight end Greg Olsen, as some in the Seahawks secondary were playing one defensive coverage and the rest another. Thomas was among those in the wrong coverage, with Carroll saying, “That’s the first time I can ever remember Earl not knowing what the other guys were doing.’’ Carroll said he still didn’t know how the breakdown specifically occurred, explaining that calls are typically relayed to the middle linebacker (which Sunday was K.J. Wright with Bobby Wagner sidelined) through the headset in his helmet and to other players from coaches on the sideline. “We know what we called and what we signaled in,’’ Carroll said. “K.J. got it, and he started the process (of sending it to the other players). It just didn’t get exchanged properly.” He said the play did not come in late, noting the Panthers had spiked the ball to stop the clock and went into a huddle. Carroll also dismissed the idea that the missed communication is a symptom of larger issues, such as the team having a first-year defensive coordinator in Kris Richard, or the players not being as attentive as in previous seasons. “We just missed it,’’ he said. “Our communication now is really at a high level, and unfortunately, you can make a mistake, and we did.” We let them down there before that all happened, and they already were in field-goal range and all that. We hadn’t done the right things earlier, but that was a big mistake. It was in communication, but it wasn’t because of all those other things that you’re thinking about.’’ More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:58:17.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
