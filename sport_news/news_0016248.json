Daniel Murphy’s homer, RBI double and shift-stomping stolen base. Noah Syndergaard in relief. Curtis Granderson’s single. Jacob deGrom gutting out six innings. Jeurys Familia’s six-out save and …\nWhoa, back up. Curtis Granderson’s single?\nThe first play of the Mets’ NLDS-clinching 3-2 win over the Dodgers was Granderson beating out a grounder, fielded by third baseman Justin Turner playing on the right side in the shift. Granderson originally was called out, the play reviewed and overturned. Granderson eventually scored and in a one-run game, no score can be downplayed.\nIt was just Granderson being Granderson. Not flashy, just reliable, effective and efficient.\n“This guy is the same way every day,” manager Terry Collins said. “He doesn’t look for headlines, he just likes to play. He loves to be in the lineup. He doesn’t care where it’s at. When he shows up, you’re going to get all you can out of him.\n“He’s led the way most of the season.”\nNo sense stopping now. Granderson, who hit .259 with 26 homers and 70 RBIs in the regular season, hit .389 against the Dodgers in the NLDS and had his monster five-RBI explosion in the Game 3 romp. In the regular season Granderson walked 91 times — he had three more in the series. He did what was needed. Repeatedly. His 26 homers from the leadoff spot set a Mets team record.\nNow he faces maybe his toughest chore — ignoring family and friends. Granderson is a Chicago product, so figure he’s going to be considered the BFF of about a half-million ticket-seeking buds.\n“Looking forward to going home,” Granderson said. “A lot of friends and family are going to be there so it’s going to be great, but there is a job to do.”\nGranderson’s Game 5 contribution was typical of the metamorphosis in the Mets’ season. They went from offensive slugs to the National League’s highest-scoring team after July 25. They did it with homers. They did it taking extra bases. They did it hustling out hits. It was a team-wide thing. And in the short series with the Dodgers, they did something mortal men are not supposed to do: They found a win to beat both Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke.\n“The big thing is continuing to believe in each other. We understand the ability that’s there. It’s just a matter of being able to execute it when you want to,” Granderson said. “And understanding that the effort level continues to remain high.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  curtis granderson ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:38:03.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
