(Photo provided by Robin Johnson) By KEVIN DRULEY - kdruley@shawmedia.com \nFive years a doubles tandem, Shelby Johnson and Madie Jurasek met at a junior girls tennis tournament well before they were Aurora Christian freshmen. \nAs their opposition and playing locales changed, the duo’s camaraderie remained constant, an asset they hope will boost them during this weekend’s IHSA Waubonsie Valley Sectional. \n“We just have a lot of fun together since we’re best friends,” Johnson said. “We balance each other out when we’re playing. We knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which helps.” \nJohnson, from Geneva, and Jurasek, from Sugar Grove, represented Aurora Christian while playing Rosary’s dual schedule this season. ACS does not have enough athletes to field a full team, but athletic director Dan Beebe worked in conjunction with the IHSA to get the pair approved for competition. Beebe officially is listed as the Eagles’ coach, but Johnson’s mother, Robin, worked to gain IHSA certification as an assistant and has attended more duals this fall. \n“Just from going to Shelby’s matches and lessons, I feel like that’s where I’ve gotten my knowledge from,” Robin Johnson said. “They needed an assistant, so I was going to be going anyway to get certified.” \nJohnson and Jurasek (13-2) are seeded third at the nine-team sectional, and have played against a handful of schools in the field, including Oswego. \nWhile backing from the ACS student body has been helpful, the pair also credits family. Whether Johnson and Jurasek advance from sectionals to the state tournament set for Oct. 22 through 24, making another round of morning announcements, they know they’ll always be strongly received at home. \n“We have a lot of support from the moms,” Jurasek said, “and we wouldn’t be able to do it without them.” \nJurasek laughed when asked if her mother, Kathy, played tennis. Not so much, it turns out. Robin Johnson could well play the role of marathon mom this weekend if the timing works out. Her son, Devin, an ACS junior, is part of the field at this weekend’s IHSA Class 1A boys golf state tournament at Prairie Vista Golf Course in Bloomington. \n“It’s hard to be a mom and a coach. I will say that for sure,” Robin Johnson said. \n• Kevin Druley is sports editor of the Kane County Chronicle.
