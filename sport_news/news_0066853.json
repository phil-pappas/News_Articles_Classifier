The boys lost the overall race to the Wranglers, 31-24, and the girls were not able to field a full team because of a runner being held out after suffering from illness the past week. Although the Cowboys were not victorious, they did turn in great times and senior Luis Valdez was the first to cross the finish line in the boy's race. Valdez clocked a 19:30 time, earning the first place finish for the Cowboys. David Hall was the next Cowboy to cross the finish line coming in 4th place, clocking a 20:50. Anthony Trujillo came in 7th place for the Cowboys finishing in 23:01. The Cowboys rounded out the race, taking the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th, places. In the girl's race, only having four runners, the Cowboys took the 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 9th places. Rie Hibi was the first Cowboys across the line, coming in 2nd place and clocking a 22:50, while Brookelyn Robach came in 4th at 26:11. Cori Cittenden clocked a 28:31 and Bailey Gagnon clocked a 31:31 for the Cowboys. The Cowboys Cross Country team will be off until next Tuesday when they travel to Glendale to race in the NWC Invitational. -- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:36:28.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
