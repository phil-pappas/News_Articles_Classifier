If the season ended today, Cresskill (North 1, Group 1 finalist), Westwood (two-time defending North 1, Group 2 champion) and Paramus Catholic (Non-Public Group 4 finalist) would be out. That leaves very little margin for error over the next three weeks with challenging schedules on tap.\nThe Paladins (2-3) may have saved their season with Friday’s stirring 19-16 win over Don Bosco. PC still sits No. 9 in New Jersey’s glamour bracket, but has cut the gap between itself and No. 8 St. Peter’s Prep to five points.\nParamus Catholic’s next two games are on the road against Friendship Academy and IMG Academy – which has beaten Bergen Catholic and St. Joseph – so the Paladins have to at least split before facing DePaul at home on Oct. 31.\nWestwood (2-3) has lost three straight, the first time that’s happened since 2011. It sits at the No. 11 spot heading into Friday night’s game at Fort Lee. The game to watch is the following week’s matchup with Ramsey, a team that desperately might need a win to keep its playoff hopes alive. Then there’s Cresskill. The Cougars are good, but are part of an evenly matched bracket where it seems anything can happen from week to week.\nThe Cougars (3-2) sit at No. 9, one point behind Saddle Brook and Becton – teams that beat Cresskill this season. The next two weeks will tell the story as the Cougars face unbeaten Park Ridge and Hasbrouck Heights on the road.\nNorth 2, Group 2 \nLyndhurst (2-3) is alive and quite well after Friday’s 30-21 upset of Garfield, a Group 3 team with four wins.\nThe Golden Bears have jumped up to No. 5 in a bracket largely populated by out-of-area teams, and could use another upset Saturday against surging Glen Rock (4-1), the top team in North 1, Group 2.\nNorth 1, Group 3 \nTenafly (2-3) has won two straight to turn its season around. The Tigers are tied for the No. 8 spot in this high-profile bracket with Bergenfield and Jefferson, and have a week off before facing Indians Hills.\nBergenfield (2-3) has lost two straight with West Milford (2-3) and Teaneck (0-5) on deck.\nNon-Public Group 3 \nDePaul (1-4), the Non-Public Group 2 champion last season, has lost four straight and is hanging on to the No. 8 spot in this 10-team bracket.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:53.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
