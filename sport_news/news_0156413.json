( Eli Lucero / The Herald Journal ) \nLOGAN, Utah — Colorado State's trip to begin Mountain West play was a wet and delayed affair from the start. \nThe Rams waited on the runway of the Loveland-Fort Collins Airport on Friday night as takeoff for their charter flight was delayed by a rain storm that hit the area, leading to weather-related concerns. The team did not arrive to the hotel in Logan, Utah until after 10 p.m. as a result. \nSaturday, right as the first half was coming to a close, lightning entered the area, leading officials to move the crowd into nearby indoor facilities for safety purposes. The NCAA requires a 30-minute delay if there is lightning within an 8-mile radius. \nOriginally, officials hoped the game could resume on time, but there was an additional 32-minute delay before the second half began. \nWhile there was little rain in the first half, there was a constant rain during halftime and through most of the second half. \nNo Chuckie — It didn't matter for the Aggies, as Kent Myers, who was 5-1 as a starter last year, led Utah State's offense quite well. He rushed for 191 yards (a school record for a QB) and threw for another 137, accounting for two touchdowns. \n\"He played an outstanding game for them,\" CSU coach Mike Bobo said. \"I thought we settled down and played a little bit better in the second half. We just let a couple of runs get out on us, and we've got to do a better job of that on defense.\" \nMyers had a long run of 34 yards, while the Aggies as a team had three players finish with at least one carry good for 30 or more yards. They rushed for 298 yards in the game, the second straight week the Rams have allowed a team to break the 200-yard mark. \nTurnover issues — Colorado State turned over the ball three times Saturday, the first two on fumbles, while the defense didn't create a single takeaway. That marks four out of five games this season where the Rams haven't won the turnover battle. The lone time came last week when CSU didn't have one and DeAndre Elliott came up with an interception. \nThe third turnover was on the Rams' last offensive play as Nick Stevens was hit as he tried to throw on fourth-and-goal from the 8. It was his fifth interception this season \nHere and there — With Utah State going with a whiteout for its homecoming game, the Aggies wore all white uniforms. Colorado State went with white pants and green jerseys. ... Rashard Higgins moved up to third on the school's career receptions list, breaking a tie with Jeff Champine. His scoring catch in the second quarter pushed his career mark in that category to 27, finishing with 10 catches for 114 yards. It was his third straight 100-yard game this season. ... Utah State defensive back Daniel Gray was ejected from the game for targeting in the first half as he hit CSU wideout Deionte Gaines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:29:24.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
