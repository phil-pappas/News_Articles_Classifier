NEW YORK – In a city more used to crying in its beer than hoisting steins in celebration, Chicago’s introduction to new Cubs manager Joe Maddon was appropriately held at the Cubby Bear bar across the street from Wrigley Field.\nUpon the conclusion of that press conference last November, Maddon offered to buy a round for everyone in the pub.\nAt the same time, Terry Collins was coming off a fourth straight losing season as Mets manager, having reached the win-or-consequences period of his tenure at Citi Field.\nEleven months later, they’ve arrived on the same big stage.\nTonight, the ever-loose Maddon and the avuncular Collins – who learned gradually how to pull back off the throttle – meet as opponents for the first time in the NL Championship Series.\nBut their personal relationship dates back decades, sharing similar traits – though Collins hasn’t advanced to such Maddon-esque tactics as dressing his players in costume on themed road trips.\nYes, those were the Cubs dressed in onesies after a late-summer series in Los Angeles. And that’s not all.\nInside the Cubs clubhouse this season, “We’ve had [live] zoo animals and magicians and a roasted pig the other day for breakfast,” said Cubs Game 1 starter Jon Lester. “You never know what Joe’s going to do to lighten the mood for us.”\nCollins gets credit for keeping the Mets from falling apart in June, when they were a band of hitless wonders.\nThat, and the Washington Nationals’ failure to run off in the NL East, gave Mets management the green light for trades – led by the acquisition of slugger Yoenis Cespedes – that vaulted them to their first division title since 2006.\nCollins’ fiery, impatient ways contributed to his departure as manager of the Angels and Astros, each after three seasons. Now, at age 66, he’s given to cracking wise at his own expense.\n“I’m old. My sense of urgency is right now,” Collins said recently of the playoff pressure. “I either get this done right now … I don’t have a lot of shots.”\nTo his players, Collins’ open-door policy – sit down, speak freely on any subject – is a comforting quality.\n“[Collins] communicates well with his players and I like that,” said reliever Tyler Clippard, one of the Mets’ mid-season acquisitions. “Across the board as players, we appreciate that.”\nAs the Angels’ manager in 1997, Collins hired Maddon – then toiling in the Angels’ minor league system – to be his big-league bench coach.\n“Back then, bench coaches were just kind of guys you’d run an idea by,” Collins said. “They really didn’t have huge input.”\nYet, it was also the burgeoning age of statistical analysis in baseball; a computer-savvy coach like Maddon was becoming a valuable commodity.\nMaddon, 61, never advanced higher than as a Class A catcher in the Angels’ system, but Collins kept hearing how much respect Maddon had earned from his players.\n“When I interviewed him [and saw] his organization, his preparation and his personality, I said, ‘This is the guy,’” said Collins, whose own playing aspirations ended at Class AAA in the Dodgers’ system.\n“I could have been sent to the minor leagues again and then who knows what would have happened,” said Maddon, sipping hot tea and hoarse from a cold.\n“So, I was always grateful for T.C. for giving me that opportunity.”\nLater as the Rays’ manager, Maddon helped transform a dormant, losing franchise into a low-payroll, high-standard winner – culminating in their 2008 AL pennant.\nAt Tampa Bay, Maddon was credited as being the godfather of the modern trend of shifting defenses – moving an infielder to short right or left field against pull hitters.\nBut Maddon said it was Collins’ go-ahead that fostered his confidence.\nOne day at Anaheim, Maddon brought in a computer printout of Seattle slugger Ken Griffey Jr.’s batting tendencies.\nMaddon asked if they could put a shift on against Griffey Jr. that night and Collins agreed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:41.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
