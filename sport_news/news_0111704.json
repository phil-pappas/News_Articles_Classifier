Photo: Tom Reel / San Antonio Express-News Apaches dance way to TAPPS 2-5A crown 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Antonian volleyball coach Samantha McLure is old-school when it comes to her philsophy, a stickler for fundamentals, toughness and focus.\nSo how did McLure react Thursday night when her players had an impromptu dance-off during an intermission between the second and third sets of a match that would determine the TAPPS 2-5A championship?
