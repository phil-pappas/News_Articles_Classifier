(AP) - Connor Cook threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns, and No. 7 Michigan State remained undefeated with a 52-26 win over Indiana on Saturday.\nCook fell just short of the school record of 400 yards passing, set by Bill Burke in 1999 against Michigan. The Spartans (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) never trailed in the second half of this one, but it was touch and go until Cook found R.J. Shelton for a 10-yard touchdown pass with 4:57 remaining to give Michigan State a 12-point lead.\nThe Spartans then tacked on two more TDs to avoid an upset a week after their unforgettable win at Michigan. Michigan State has won 12 in a row for the first time since 1956. This run is tied for the third-longest winning streak in school history.\nIndiana (4-4, 0-4) was outscored 24-0 in the fourth quarter.\n___\nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
