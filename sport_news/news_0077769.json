(AP) — The Seattle Seahawks are lifting the suspension of fullback Derrick Coleman imposed after he was arrested following a car crash. \nSeattle coach Pete Carroll announced the decision Monday and said it would be done as soon as possible. With the suspension lifted, Coleman could play Thursday night against San Francisco, but Carroll said the fullback has yet to be examined by team doctors following his involvement in the crash. \nColeman was suspended last week after his arrest for investigation of vehicular assault and hit-and-run. Coleman was booked into King County Jail early Thursday and initially denied bail. Police officers in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue said they arrested him because he left the scene of the two-car accident. \nColeman was released from jail on Friday and King County prosecutors said they would wait until an investigation is complete before deciding whether to file criminal charges. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:59:35.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
