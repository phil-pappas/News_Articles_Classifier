Kershaw started Game 1 but took the loss after allowing three runs on four hits in 6 1/3 innings. Kershaw will likely be opposed by Mets rookie left-hander Steven Matz .\nThe Dodgers, of couse, don't have much in the way of rotation depth right now ( Brandon McCarthy and Hyun-Jun Ryu have long been lost for the season), and they've opted against giving an NLDS start to Alex Wood , who's on the roster.\nIn 12 postseason games, nine of which have been starts, Kershaw has pitched to an ERA of 4.99 and a K/BB ratio of 3.14. To say the least, those numbers are much worse than Kershaw's established standards.\nKershaw has never made a start on short rest during the regular season, but he's made two starts on three days' rest in the postseason: Game 4 of the 2013 NLDS against the Braves and Game 4 of the 2014 NLDS against the Cardinals. In those two starts, Kershaw gave up a combined five runs in 12.0 innings while striking out 15 and walking three. This, then, will be the third straight year that Kershaw has started Game 4 of the NLDS on three days' rest. \n\nClayton Kershaw is slated to take the ball for the Dodgers in Game 4 of the NLDS.
