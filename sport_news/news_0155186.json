Jenkins was a basketball coach and teacher at Gulfport for 39 years, leading Gulfport High to 7 State Championships and many other accomplishments. He passed away on September 23. AMANDA MCCOY â€” SUN HERALD | Buy Photo \nGULFPORT -- A great basketball coach, a molder of young men and a person of great integrity. \nThose were just a few of the many descriptions given of Bert Jenkins during a Thursday memorial held in the gymnasium that bears his name at Gulfport High School. \nJenkins died at age 90 on Sept. 23 at Wesley Medical Center in Hattiesburg after suffering a heart attack. His funeral was held Sunday at Heritage United Methodist Church in Hattiesburg. \nOn Thursday, many of those who grew closest to him during his 28 years as head coach at Gulfport shared some of their fondest memories of Jenkins. \nIn the bleachers Thursday were former players, coaches who worked with him and even refs who called his games. \nJenkins had enormous success as the basketball coach at Gulfport with a career record of 866-180, seven state championships and 13 Big Eight titles. \nFor those who had the opportunity to walk to the podium and express their admiration of Jenkins, their emotion was most obvious when they discussed their personal relationship with Jenkins. \nJenkins' most celebrated player, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, who went onto become a legendary guard at LSU and a sharp shooter in the NBA, became most emotional when he relayed the story of how he was first diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome. \nAbdul-Rauf, who was then known as Chris Jackson, was frustrated by the uncontrollable tics he dealt with as a child. Jenkins' wife, Lil, approached Jackson's mother and asked if she would allow them to take him to a specialist to be seen about his condition. \n\"For years, I had been struggling, not knowing what was wrong,\" Abdul-Rauf said Thursday. \"I was just totally oblivious to my condition, but I knew something was wrong. As a young boy growing up, I had basketball, but I didn't have a father. There are a lot of things people don't know about that you're struggling with.\" \nAbdul-Rauf recalled how the doctor walked into the room and began to ask him questions, \"knowing all along what it was.\" \n\"He said 'You have Tourette Syndrome,'\" Abdul-Rauf said, growing emotional. \"The weight that took off my shoulders as a young boy struggling with identity, not knowing what was wrong. I'm going to be forever grateful.\" \nThe reminders of Jenkins' accomplishments are everywhere at Bert Jenkins Gymnasium. Numerous trophies are encased in the lobby and championship banners hang in the gym. \nNate Barkum, who played for Jenkins during his final three years as the head coach at Gulfport from 1987-89, was there in the bleachers Thursday night. He and friends have spent the last week sharing stories of Jenkins \n\"One of the things that's been really great is coming together as a family,\" Barkum said. \"Coach always kept us together as a family. We've come together to celebrate his life and all the things he did and remember all the things he taught us. Despite the occasion, it's great to see everybody come back to remember him, the man and who he was.\" \nCurrent Gulfport head coach Owen Miller, who also played under Jenkins, found himself learning more about his mentor over the last week. \n\"When you look at his life, it was a life of inspiration with all the things he overcame, the things he accomplished,\" Miller said. \"You learn through one of his daughters his stance on civil rights. He'd come home there would be for sale signs in his yard. People were calling and hanging up, saying vulgar things. \n\"He was the same guy no matter what crowd he was in. He never wavered. It's an inspiration to hear these things and try to live that way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:22:49.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
