At 1-1 there is a huge penalty and, once more, we do not get it. \n\"If the FA wants to punish me they can punish me, no problem. But referees are afraid to give decisions to Chelsea. Why? Because when they do there is always criticism. So we are always punished.\" \nFor more sports news visit allSports.com.gh Sports News Follow Us Don't be wise in your own eyes for the wicked that men do always follows them. By: Rev.
