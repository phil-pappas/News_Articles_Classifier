Despite that packaging, you should probably avoid shipping him. (Fragile, handle with care, etc.) \nHe's dealing with a hip injury that could result in retirement but also struggling with some personal stuff that's keeping him from joining the Bills in London. Or as Doug Whaley said Friday, Harvin's absence is \"not strictly injury-related.\" \n\"We'll keep that in-house, but I know there's a lot of other things that are going on that it's just not strictly injury-related,\" the Bills GM said .\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora previously reported Harvin could deal with a \"long-term absence\" as a result of his hip injury.\nThere's clearly other issues as well, with Rex Ryan echoing Whaley's comments when he said earlier in the week Percy was missing because of \"personal\" reasons.\n\"Well no, I think right now this is a personal thing right now,\" Ryan said. \"That's where it is.\"\nRex meant it wasn't Harvin's hip causing the issue in London so much as a personal thing.\nVery weird how all this is playing out. Harvin's struggled to fit in previously with the Vikings (who drafted him) and the Seahawks . If he backfires as a football signing on the Bills it's hard not say they didn't see it coming. \nPercy might be missing for a while.
