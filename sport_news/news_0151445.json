(Photo by Rich Schultz /Getty Images)[/caption]Tim Tebow came into preseason action with the Philadelphia Eagles this season looking like a near lock to make the final 53-man roster. Head coach Chip Kelly had signed him despite quite a bit of media disagreement and was a very big fan of his. He talked about how Tebow's skill-set fit into what the Eagles were trying to do and even went so far as to trade away former USC superstar quarterback Matt Barkley to the Arizona Cardinals ahead of the season.Despite all of the positives that seemed to be going Tebow's way with the Eagles, they decided to cut him just ahead of the season.Looking ahead at his future, there are not going to be very many options for him. Due to all of the media scrutiny that surrounds him, teams have been very careful about bringing him on board. There are even fewer teams that have a need at the quarterback position and are actually interested in bringing in another player with a big name like Tebow possesses.One team that would make a lot of sense is the Washington Redskins, who are in the middle of a nasty quarterback controversy right now. Robert Griffin III was benched in favor of Kirk Cousins just ahead of the season and that hasn't gone over very well. Head coach Jay Gruden has to be concerned about the lack of a leader at the quarterback position, which leads to the idea that the Redskins should consider signing Tebow.More than likely, the Redskins could get him for a one-year deal worth around $700,000 or less. He could come for much less on the cheapest deal possible just to have a chance to prove that he can play in the NFL one more time.Washington should definitely look to make the move and give Tebow one more chance. Simply having a player with the experience and leadership that Tebow brings to the table would be a huge move in the right direction for the Redskins. Gruden might not be able to work with a player like Tebow, but there is no question that he would be willing to change his game to accommodate what Gruden wants to do with his offense.During the preseason action with the Eagles, Tebow showed off a much improved arm. He was much more accurate and his mechanics were much improved as well. While those were good signs, there were still issues that he will need to figure out moving forward if he wants to make starting in the NFL a long-term option.All of that being said, this scenario would only happen if the Redskins are willing to take the media scrutiny that comes with signing a celebrity figure like Tebow.Obviously there are going to be quite a few fans that throw this idea out the window without even considering the possibility. His name is negatively looked at due to the Christian faith that he showed so openly during his days as the starting quarterback with the Denver Broncos. It is easily swept under the rug, however, that he took over a dead team and brought them back to life and into the playoffs.Not only did he lead them to the playoffs, he also was able to lead them to a Wild Card victory over a very good Pittsburgh Steelers football team.Don't expect to see the Redskins consider signing Tebow moving ahead this season, but it is something that they definitely should look into. Simply having a leader and willing learner under center would make them much more competitive and he might just be the guy that they need to help turn the franchise around. That type of talk won't be looked at very well by most readers, but there is no question that more information needs to be looked at before dismissing the idea.", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/486470938/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:34:48.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
