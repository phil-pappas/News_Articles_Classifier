Jerad Eickhoff struck out 10 in seven dominant innings, Darin Ruf hit a two-run homer and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the NL East champion Mets 3-0 on Thursday to complete a three-game sweep. The Mets are tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for home-field advantage in the division series, which begins next Friday. Los Angeles beat San Francisco 3-2 later Thursday. New York holds the tiebreaker. \"We talked about the importance of coming here and winning games and then we didn't win any,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"We can't worry about today. It's over. Focus on tomorrow.\" The Mets host the Washington Nationals over the weekend and expect outfielder Yoenis Cespedes to return to the lineup. Cespedes, as expected, didn't play after bruising two fingers on his left hand when he was hit by a pitch Wednesday night. Collins said Cespedes told him he was available, but he gave him the day off. \"Just the way the series went, you knew there was going to be an energy drain,\" Collins said. \"We rested some guys.\" The Phillies lost 14 of 16 to the Mets before sweeping them in a three-game series for the first time since April 26-28, 2013, at Citi Field. Philadelphia needs to win one of its last three games against Miami to avoid losing 100 games for the first time since 1961. An announced crowd of 13,238 was the smallest in the 12-year history of Citizens Bank Park. Only several hundred fans were in the stands for a game that was moved up seven hours because heavy rain is expected later. Dodgers 3, Giants 2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Brett Anderson pitched two-hit ball into the eighth in his final regular-season start, and the NL West champion Los Angeles Dodgers wrapped up their road schedule with a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday. Anderson (10-9) retired 14 straight batters following Kevin Frandsen's one-out single in the third before Jarrett Parker singled to start the eighth. The lefty made his 31st start for a career high, topping his 30 outings in 2009 as a rookie with Oakland. Healthy for the season again, he also reached a high for innings with 180 1-3. Just three balls left the infield against Anderson and no San Francisco runner reached second base until an eighth-inning throwing error by second baseman Howie Kendrick. Anderson gave up four hits, struck out three and didn't walk a batter in 7 2-3 innings. Tim Hudson (8-9) allowed three runs and three hits in 2 1-3 innings in the final start of his 17-year big league career. Orioles 6, Blue Jays 4 BALTIMORE (AP) — The Toronto Blue Jays extended the celebration of their first AL East title in 22 years, resting their starters Thursday in a rain-marred 6-4 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. Manny Machado homered twice for the Orioles, who took a 3-0 lead in the first inning against Drew Hutchison (13-5) before the game was delayed for 3 hours, 25 minutes. Although the Blue Jays are still dueling with Kansas City for the best record in the AL — a distinction that provides home-field advantage through the postseason — Toronto manager John Gibbons has placed a priority on keeping his players fresh. Blue Jays ace David Price was scratched from his scheduled start. Slugging stars Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion also sat out. The Blue Jays clinched the division in the opener of a doubleheader Wednesday. Todd McFarland (1-2) pitched four innings for his first win since July 27, 2014. Zach Britton worked the ninth for his 35th save.
