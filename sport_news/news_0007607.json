(AP) - New York state has begun work on a new visitor center at an environmental education area in Albany County intended to promote learning about natural resources while highlighting sustainable building techniques.\nThe $7 million visitor center at Five Rivers Environmental Education Center in Delmar is slated to be completed in December 2016. Officials say it will offer \"hands-on\" exhibits and will be constructed with wood harvested from nearby trees, a solar power system and environmentally friendly plumbing and lighting.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo announced the groundbreaking at the site on Thursday. Officials say the facility will not only promote recreation and tourism but also serve as an example of green architecture and design.\nSome 70,000 people each year visit Five Rivers, which offers hiking, wildlife viewing and other outdoor recreation activities designed for families and users of all ages and abilities.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:35:48.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
