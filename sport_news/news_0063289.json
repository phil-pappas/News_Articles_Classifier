Coakley hit junior James Abbe with a 46-yard touchdown pass in the opening quarter, with senior Tyler Glover added a 56-yard touchdown run to give Upper Cape (3-2, 2-2 Mayflower Athletic Conference Small) a 16-0 lead. Senior captain Kyle Johnson added a pair of two-point conversions runs in the first quarter. “Kyle has been our workhorse and today, and moving forward, we’re trying to get more guys involved in the offense,” said UCT coach Mike Hernon. An interception by Declan Woodside thwarted a Sacred Heart drive inside the Rams’ 20-yardline and Coakley then scampered 64 yards for the Rams’ third touchdown. Glover added the two-point conversion rush for a 24-0 lead before the half. Sacred Heart (0-4 overall and MAC Small) got on the board in the fourth quarter on a 10-yard run and a two-point conversion by Jim O’Brien. Trevor Mosher, Jake Tomazik and Dylan Bowers excelled up front for UCT according to Hernon while linebackers Jay Allen and John Silvia helped limit the Saints attack for much of the day. Case 34, Bourne 28: In a game that took 25 hours and 26 minutes to complete from start to finish, the Bourne Canalmen dropped a heartbreaker to South Coast Conference rival Case, 34-28, at Jackson Memorial Field. The difference between pulling off an upset win over the Cardinals and losing by a touchdowns was turnovers. In a game that started in torrential rains Friday night, was stopped twice for lightning delays, the second forcing the game to be picked up in the second quarter Saturday night, Bourne (1-4) had the upper hand until Case (4-1) forced some costly turnovers, one directly leading to a touchdown (a 65-yard interception return by Jeremy Thiboutot) eventually getting Bourne to give the ball up six times in the game. “Against a team as talented as Case, you can’t do that,” said Bourne head coach John McIntyre. “We are basically a young team and we made some young mistakes tonight. But, the effort was there and the kids never let up. We played hard all the time we our out there.” The backfield tandem of Case’s quarterback Brendan Costa and running back Aidan Silva provided most of the offense for the Cardinals as the pair accounted for four of the five Case TDs scored in the game. Each player scored on a big play – Silva on a 99-yard TD run in the opening quarter Friday night and Costa on a 63-yard touchdown jaunt last night. Their ability to move the Case offense offset a solid game from Bourne running back Jacob Haypenny and quarterback Tyler Rondeau. Haypenny scored one TD and Rondeau carried in a pair of scores as well as hitting Spencer Ross with a 16-yard scoring strike that gave the home club a brief 20-13 lead at the half. However, the second half was dominated by Case as they punched in three touchdowns and outscored the host club, 21-8 over the final 22 minutes. “It was a tough one to drop,” McIntyre added. “But, you learn from games like these and hopefully we grow from this.” Geoff Converse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:18:28.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
