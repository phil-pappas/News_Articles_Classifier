What a great team win. The guys really rallied, and it was a great outcome tonight.” \nFormer Danbury High standout Will Andrew caught five passes for 184 yards and touchdowns of 38, 37 and 31 yards. Connor Falaguerra caught three passes for 94 yards and touchdowns of 74 and 16 yards — and made a key recovery of an onside kick after Fitchburg had rallied to cut Western’s lead to 21 with 10:12 remaining. Alex Altermatt caught five passes for 84 yards and a 65-yard touchdown. Mike Nichol rushed 31 times for 121 yards touchdowns of four and eight yards. \n“To be honest, I really wasn’t that sharp tonight,” Arndt said. “The guys around me, up front and on the perimeter, did a great job. All the credit to them.” \nThe Colonials’ defense and special teams, meanwhile, forced five second-half fumbles and recovered four of them to all but extinguish any hopes Fitchburg had of a comeback. From those four recovered fumbles, the Colonials (4-3, 3-2 MASCAC) scored three touchdowns. Raheem Williams , Douglas Katz , Dylan Sadick and Dominique Carr each recovered a fumble and Kyle Porter , Ty Harris and Sadick each registered a sack. Ken Strecker led the Colonials with 12 tackles, while Bobby Durham had seven tackles and broke up two passes. Bryan Ballenilla made six tackles and Maliek Williamson and Devante Credle chipped in with five apiece. \nJevon Brown-Simpson led the Fitchburg offense, rushing 16 times for 81 yards and two scores. Ty Spencer and Devin Summiel each caught a touchdown pass from Garrett Dellechiaie, who threw for 318 yards. Luis Feliz led the way with 10 tackles for Fitchburg (5-2, 3-2 MASCAC). \nWESTERN CONNECTICUT 57, FITCHBURG STATE 30 \nFITCHBURG STATE \n3 6 14 7 — 30 \nWESTERN CONNECTICUT \nWC— Michael Killoran , 21 field goal. \nFS—Christopher Ludwig, 22 field goal. \nWC— Michael Nichol , 4 run (Killoran kick). \nWC—Connor Falaguerra, 74 pass from Will Arndt (Killoran kick). \nFS—Ty Spencer, 16 pass from Garrett Dellechiaie (kick blocked by Stephen DeJournett). \nWC—Will Andrew, 38 pass from Arndt (Killoran kick). \nFS—Devin Summiel, 7 pass from Dellechiaie (pass failed). \nWC—Alex Altermatt, 65 pass from Arndt (Killoran kick). \nWC—Falaguerra, 16 pass from Arndt (Killoran kick). \nWC—Andrew, 37 pass from Arndt (kick blocked). \nFS— Taron Seaforth -Howard, 95 return of a failed extra-point attempt. \nFS—Jevon Brown-Simpson, 1 run (pass failed). \nWC—Andrew, 31 pass from Arndt (Killoran kick). \nFS—Brown-Simpson, 1 run (Ludwig kick). \nWC—Nichol, 8 run (kick failed). \nRecords: Fitchburg State (5-2, 3-2 MASCAC); Western Connecticut (4-3, 3-2 MASCAC).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:19:03.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
