CHICAGO (AP) — Patrick Kane and rookie Artemi Panarin each had a goal and two assists, and the Chicago Blackhawks beat the New York Islanders 4-1 on Saturday night.\nDefenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk added his first career NHL goal as the Blackhawks cruised to their first home win of the season. Chicago also beat New York 3-2 in overtime on Friday night, spoiling the Islanders’ Brooklyn debut.\nChase Agnello-Dean/NHLI via Getty Images Frans Nielsen falls and loses the puck to Blackhawks' Jonathan Toews. Scott Darling made 28 saves for the reigning Stanley Cup champions in his first start of the season. He was working on a shutout before Cal Clutterbuck got a short-handed goal with 1:05 left in the third. Jean-Francois Berube had 30 stops for New York in his NHL debut.\nChase Agnello-Dean/NHLI via Getty Images Artemi Panarin celebrates his goal in the Blackhawks' 4-1 victory. No. 1 goalie Jaroslav Halak remains out with an upper-body injury, and the 24-year-old Berube was claimed off waivers from the Kings last Tuesday. Kane, who had two goals in the victory at New York on Friday night, assisted on van Riemsdyk’s opening score in the first period, and set up Panarin at 5:53 of the second.\nKane then tipped a pass from van Riemsdyk by Berube for a 3-0 lead. Kane, who has three goals and three assists in Chicago’s first three games, is the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York. He hasn’t been charged, and has said he expects to be exonerated. Chicago defenseman Brent Seabrook added a 5-on-3 power-play goal late in the third period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:06:38.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
