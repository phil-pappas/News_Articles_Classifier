He died in 2003. (Photo: Circa 1955 Getty Images file) \nPeter Anthony of Melbourne grew up in the Boston area in the mid-1940s, where most young boys made their first big decision; Red Sox or Braves. It was one or the other, a life-long fan commitment. \nFor Peter, it was the Braves, inspired by his uncle’s solid allegiance to the team. He took Peter to Braves games every chance he got, often on days when Warren Spahn, the team’s ace lefthander, was pitching. \nThat led Peter to his next big decision. He would be a loyal Warren Spahn fan. He was fascinated by Spahn’s windup, his signature high leg-kick, the way he hid the ball and his grip behind his glove until the last second, and the fluidity of his entire motion. This he repeated precisely, regardless of which pitch he was going to throw. That made his pitching especially effective. \nHis catcher, Del Crandall, once said, “Sometimes his motion deceived me … .and I was the catcher.” Opposing batters had the same problem. \nSolidifying Peter’s attraction to Spahn was the fact that he was a lefty, just like himself, which made Peter aspire to becoming a pitcher. By his early teens, he’d become an accomplished hurler and played in the Boston Park League. His team won the championship two years in a row, a big perk of which was playing the final game in Braves Field. \nOften there were Braves players working out nearby and hanging around to watch part of the game. Spahn was one of them, and he was so impressed with Peter’s ability on the mound that he sought him out after the game to offer a few pointers. Peter was dumbfounded and starstruck by Spahn’s interest and attention, which was the start of a special relationship between star and teen, that Peter cherishes to this day. \nSpahn taught him how to throw an effortless but effective curve ball. He invited Peter into the Braves’ dugout during games, and he even got him a part-time bat boy job. Spahn obviously enjoyed mentoring this bright and receptive young man. He talked not only about pitching, but also about important values. \n“How did you learn how to pitch, Mr. Spahn?” \n“Hitters taught me how to pitch,” was his answer. In other words, be observant, try different things, learn, adapt, remember, and — above all — work hard. Just like real life, he said, where it’s also important to be honest, caring and sharing. Peter took it all in. \nNaturally, Peter followed Spahn’s success every season, until he finally retired from Major League Baseball in 1965. In the years leading up to that, Spahn amassed 363 wins, had seven 21-win seasons, and two in which he won 23. Unlike today’s starting pitchers who usually pitch six or seven innings before being relieved, and have a pitch-count limit as well, Spahn went the distance in most of his games. In his 23-win season of 1963, 22 were complete games. He pitched two no-hitters, but not until the twilight of his career: one at age 39, the other at 40. At 42, he threw for an entire 16-inning game for more than five hours against the San Francisco Giants. \nBut for all his on-field achievements, which took him into the Hall of Fame, Peter remembers him most as a kind and giving man who, despite his star power, went well out of his way to mentor a young ballplayer and impart life advice, which Peter proudly follows to this day. \n“I was very fortunate to have had such a special and meaningful relationship in my life at such a formative time. Warren will always be a lifetime star to me and I remain forever grateful,” said Peter, with obvious emotion. \nShare your story \nIf you’ve had an interesting and entertaining sports experience (involving a celebrity or not), I’d like to hear about it and share it with our readers.
