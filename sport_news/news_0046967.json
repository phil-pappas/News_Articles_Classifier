By the third period, he was doing the splits to turn away the Pittsburgh Penguins . \nSmith shook off a hard collision to stop 27 shots, Jordan Martinook scored his first career NHL goal and the Arizona Coyotes withstood a late flurry to beat the Penguins 2-1 on Saturday night. \n\"He's just in a groove, stopping everything,\" Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said of Smith. \nSmith was injured in the first period after being run into by teammate Brad Richardson , who was shoved from behind by Pittsburgh's Patric Hornqvist . Smith lay on the ice for a couple minutes, but stayed in and made some big saves down the stretch, including one while doing a split to stop Nick Bonino from close range. Smith has stopped 67 of 69 shots in two games. \nTobias Rieder also scored for the Coyotes, who have won their first two games for the first time since 2009-10. Arizona beat the Los Angeles Kings and Pittsburgh in consecutive games both seasons. \n\"It felt like a playoff game out there with all the energy,\" Smith said. \"We just sort of picked up where we left off.\" \nMarc-Andre Fleury nearly matched Smith, stopping 37 shots, and Phil Kessel scored his first goal with Pittsburgh. But just like they did in Thursday's season opener, the Penguins had trouble getting pucks to go into the net. Pittsburgh has two goals on 55 shots through two games, both losses. \n\"Right now it's loose-puck battles and work ethic,\" Penguins coach Mike Johnston said. \"When you're playing a game like this, you know that's a pure staple of the game.\" \nArizona's new-look team had an impressive debut Friday night, opening the season with a 4-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings despite getting off just 22 shots. Max Domi had a goal and an assist in his NHL debut and Smith was superb in goal, turning away 40 shots. \nThe Coyotes had a short turnaround before playing their home opener against Pittsburgh, one of the NHL's most talented offensive teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:05:47.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
