(Dave, Cincinnati) \nAnswer: They’re unbelievably difficult, certainly the most emotional days of my career. But the job requires professionalism, and that’s what I strive to deliver. Even days like yesterday’s Celebration of Life for Justin Wilson are difficult, but they’re rewarding when you see people like Stefan Wilson, Michael Shank, Bill Pappas and Scott Dixon step up and deliver like the pros they are. Obviously, Stefan had the most difficult duty, but go back to the video and listen to Dixon. More and more, he’s the champion of champions, IndyCar's quiet but commanding leader. \nQuestion: I understand the call for covers, or canopies, for IndyCar . If it would have saved Justin I would be all for it but, I also wonder how the use of something like that may have made Hinch's rescue in May more iffy. Could a delay have been the difference between him testing or not being with us now. (Phil, Columbus, Ohio) \nAnswer: You raise the most important point. Before IndyCar or any other racing organization makes a car change that significant, it must understand the unintended consequences. A canopy must be 100 percent without fail in rescue situations where every second counts. \nQuestion: If IndyCar did not have double points this year who would have won the championship? (Jim, Fishers, Ind.) \nAnswer: If my quick math is correct, Juan Montoya would have finished with five more points than Dixon. Graham Rahal would have been third in the final standings, swapping positions with Will Power. But let’s remember that everyone knew the allocation entering the season, and there were no complaints then. Big ups to Dixon for doing everything he had to do in the finale. Fact is, if Montoya doesn’t run into his teammate mid-race, he probably wins the title. \nQuestion: Why was Rahal not penalized at Fontana for leaving his pit box with the re-fueling hose attached? Seemed like an attempt to help the son of an American racing icon to further his championship chances. That decision -- or indecision -- obviously cost Derrick Walker his job. (Wayne, Woodland Park, Colo.) \nAnswer: Based on season precedent, Rahal would have received a post-race penalty for the botched pit stop, but what Walker said IndyCar’s officiating group missed was the cause of the debris on the track (it came from Rahal’s car), and that’s where the penalty should have come. I don’t believe favoritism was involved, and by the way, I think Rahal had a strong enough car that day to perhaps overcome the drive-through penalty he should have received. But still, the call should have been made. Did it directly cost Walker his job? No, but the backlash from individuals Walker thought supported him -- seems safe to say the Penske group -- was part of the reason he decided to step away. It was unfortunate on all fronts. As I said, I think if the call had been made, Rahal could have worked his way back through the field to make the penalty a non-issue, and IndyCar/Walker would have had a smoother second half of the season. Walker might still be series president. \nFollow Curt Cavin on Facebook and Twitter: @curtcavin Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1KLkfZo Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:53:32.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
