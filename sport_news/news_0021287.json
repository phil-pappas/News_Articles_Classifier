It happened back in 1945, the last time the Cubs were in the World Series, when the owner of the \"Billy Goat Tavern\" was kicked out of Wrigley Field because his pet goat's odor was bothering other fans \nUpon leaving the stadium, the outraged man declared, \"Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more\". And a curse was born. Now here's a little known fact, the name of that Billy Goat was Murphy. \nWhich brings us to 2015, where a player named Murphy, is doing his best to single handedly keep the Cubs World Series streak alive. The Mets Daniel Murphy, a player who through the course of the regular season hit one home run off left-handed pitching, made many base running blunders and has a glove best served as a designated hitter, has emerged as the breakout star of this NLCS. \nMurphy has hit five post-season home runs. Two off Clayton Kershaw, one apiece off of Zack Greinke, Jon Lester and Jake Arrietta. Might as well ask Murph who the N.L. Cy Young award should be since he's homered off of all of them. \nAnd here's the best part of your Daniel Murphy, he's about to become a free agent. \nShow him the money, which a lot of teams not named the Mets will do. There are published reports out of New York that old man Wilpon and his baseball challenged son Jeff will not offer Murphy a contract for next season. The player who has been with the team since 2004 is sure to be playing elsewhere next season. \nSo while the nucleus of the team DeGrom, Harvey, Syndergard , Matz and wheeler are all signed under reasonable contracts, don't look for ownership to back up the armored truck for the likes of Murphy and Cespedes. Call it a hangover from the Bernie Madoff scam that the owners swore would not affect the operation of the ball club before the New York team started rivaling Kansas City and Tampa Bay for payroll numbers. \nAfter all, guys like Bobby Bonilla and Brett Saberhagen are still on the payroll. \nSo while ownership tries to rain on this dream parade in New York, the team wins in spite of them. And the one player who has emerged as the hero to keeping the Cubs out of the World Series shares the same name as a goat who many think is the reason the Cubs haven't won in 107 years.
