His other touchdown was a 3-yard run in the second quarter. \nPipkin completed 21 of 26 passes for 233 yards and two touchdowns, both short passes to Dequan Malone and Brandon Walker. Pipkin also added 53 rushing yards and completed a pass to Malone on a successful two-point conversion attempt. \nThe game was close until Vanhook scored the final two touchdowns with under four minutes left. \nHarmony Grove never led, but did tie the score 6-6 at the end of the first quarter and shaved Prescott's lead to 24-20 in the fourth quarter. \nRunning back Jon Johnson led the Cardinals with 209 yards on 29 carries, one touchdown and a successful two-point conversion. Johnson carried the ball on 19 of the Cardinals' 20 third-quarter snaps. \nQuarterback Dakota Rains scored the Cardinals' other two touchdowns, one a 3-yard strike to Brinson Cornwell and the other a 28-yard pass to Alec Shilling. \nThe Cardinals twice stopped Prescott at the 1, but ultimately, turnovers doomed Harmony Grove's comeback. One promising third-quarter drive ended when Rains threw an interception, and a fumble on a late kickoff let Prescott put the game away with Vanhook's last score. \nSMACKOVER 28, CAMDEN HARMONY GROVE 7 \nCAMDEN — Jordan Jones returned the second half kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown to break open a 14-7 game and lifted Smackover (6-2, 5-0 6-3A) to a victory over Camden Harmony Grove (6-2, 4-1). \nDewayne Jones added a 1-yard touchdown run and Keiandre Purifoy’s twopoint conversion made it 28-7 with 4:31 left. \nDANVILLE 40, LAMAR 15 \nDANVILLE — Jamey Holbrook rushed for 167 yards and scored four touchdowns to help Danville (5-3, 4-1) take a share of first place in the 4-3A Conference with a victory over Lamar (7-1, 4-1). \nHolbrook, who carried nine times, had touchdown runs of 36, 70 and 37 yards. His first touchdown came on a 74-yard pass from Jake Madding. \nMadding rushed 23 times for 152 yards, including a 62-yard touchdown run.
