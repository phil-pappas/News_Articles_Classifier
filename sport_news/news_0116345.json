The new Orlando team was announced Tuesday and will begin play next season. Morgan's husband, Servando Carrasco, plays for Major League Soccer's Orlando City. \nSports Illustrated first reported the deal that would send Morgan and Canadian Kaylyn Kyle to Orlando for the Pride's first pick in the NWSL draft, two international slots, and U.S. national team defender Meghan Klingenberg, currently with the Houston Dash. \nThe Thorns didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. \nThe 26-year-old Morgan is one of the most popular female players in the world. She was on the U.S. team that won the Women's World Cup this summer in Canada. She first made a splash at the London Olympics when she scored the overtime winner for the United States in a semifinal victory over Canada. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:56:38.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
