He lasted six seasons as the Jets head coach.\nIt’s been six games in Buffalo, and there are already signs of trouble. Last week, first-round draft pick Sammy Watkins complained about a lack of targets, telling the team, through The Buffalo News , “you’re making me look bad.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Two days ago, Bills defensive end Mario Williams, who signed a six-year, $96 million contract in 2012, complained about not having enough chances to rush the passer, a product of Ryan’s defensive scheme.\n“I think I probably set a record on dropping [back] today, but that’s part of the scheme for us to go out and be put in a position to win,” Williams said. “Whatever’s called, you have to go out and do it.”\nMonday, defensive tackle Marcell Dareus backed up Williams’s concerns.\n“Hey, like [Williams] said, they pay us a lot of money,” Darius said, via ESPN.com . “And we want to use our talents the best way we know how. If we’re going to be dropping we don’t want to get questions about not getting sacks. That’s just how it is.\n“We want to make some plays. We don’t want fans looking at us crazy. ... Hopefully Rex is going to implement it. There’s nothing we can do.”\nThe Bills failed to record a sack of Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton in Sunday’s 34-21 loss. Buffalo is 3-3 and still has a shot to make the playoffs, so it’s not like the team can’t turn it around. But recent events don’t bode well for Ryan’s long-term future in Buffalo.\nPhotos: 12 great things Rex Ryan said about the Patriots\nPrevious -- of -- Next June, 2009: \"I never came here to kiss Bill Belichick's, you know, rings,\" Ryan said in an interview with WFAN radio. \"I came to win. Let's just put it that way. So we'll see what happens. I'm certainly not intimidated by New England or anybody else.\" Andy Marlin / Getty Images Previous -- of -- Next January, 2011: “There's nobody like this guy (Peyton Manning) in the league. Nobody studies like him and all that. I know Brady thinks he does and all that stuff, but I think there's a little more help from Belichick with Brady than there is with Peyton Manning.\" Bill Kostroun / AP Previous -- of -- Next January, 2011: \"This is about Bill Belichick versus Rex Ryan,\" Ryan declared prior to the Patriots divisional playoff contest against the Jets. \"There’s no question. It’s personal. It’s about him versus myself, and that’s what it’s going to come down to.\" Belichick offered a tongue-in-cheek reply: \"Well, I might have a little quickness on him. He’s probably got a little more strength and power on me.\" Charles Krupa / AP Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next October, 2011: \"It's Belichick versus I. I mean you’re talking about two Hall of Famers,\" Ryan said prior to a Jets-Patriots game, sporting a doctored sports coat with a Southwestern Hall of Fame patch . \"Because we know he's going to have a bust in Canton and all of that -- that minor Hall of Fame ... It boils down to two Hall of Famers butting heads.\" The Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next November, 2011: \"It was a stretch. There's no doubt, it was a stretch,\" Ryan said on being cast in Adam Sandler's \"That's My Boy\" as a lawyer who is a rabid Boston sports fan. \"It was good. They had me with Red Sox stuff in there, Patriots stuff all over the place, they even had some Bruins stuff in there. And, quite honestly, I'm not a fan of any of those teams, but it was good.\" Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Previous -- of -- Next October, 2014: “Obviously, [we're] on to San Diego,\" Ryan joked while showing off a wide grin to the chuckling media, following up Belichick's famous \"we're on to Cincinatti\" press conference. \"OK, here we go. Trying, can we just move on?\" Seth Wenig / AP Previous -- of -- Next March, 2015: \"They're clearly the team to beat and we're coming after them,\" Ryan said at the AFC coaches breakfast as coach of the Buffalo Bills. \"When you’re the world champs, you’re not going to get better. They lost some good players so hopefully we have closed the gap. Guess we have to find out.\" Bill Wippert / AP Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next April, 2015: \"I think there's an obvious thing that we should talk about first: My pitch actually made it to the plate,\" Ryan said comparing his first pitch at a Buffalo minor league baseball game to Tom Brady's Fenway pitch that fell short. \"Tom needs to keep his elbow up a little bit more, I think. I would have said, 'Hey, Tom. Let's take one practice toss out there on that mound, maybe.' But Tom likes taking advice from me, I know. I'm sure he'll be working with that.\" Elise Amendola / AP Previous -- of -- Next September, 2015: \"I mean they’re decent backs in their own right. But I don’t think we’re gonna focus on that kid,\" Ryan said very recently about Patriots running back Dion Lewis. \"I can’t even tell you that kid’s name. But you’re gonna focus on the guy throwing the ball, I’ll tell you that much.\" Charles Krupa / AP", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13932727/marcell-dareus-joins-mario-williams-questioning-buffalo-bills-coach-rex-ryan-calls", "http://espn.go.com/blog/buffalo-bills/post/_/id/21589/cold-front-is-accurate-name-for-frozen-bills-defensive-line", "https://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/10/15/sammy-watkins-speaks-up-when-i-get-one-on-one-just-target-me/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:08:58.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
