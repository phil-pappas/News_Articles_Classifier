Hard. To. Tackle” to its 13.6 million followers.\nSo. Hard. To.

Read on to see how the world reacted to the Aussie’s fifth NFL appearance.\nUS MEDIA — ‘BIGGEST RUN OF HIS CAREER’\nWITH his eight-yard surge midway through the third quarter, the former NRL star made what San Francisco Chronical writer Eric Branch is calling the “biggest run of his career”, putting the 49ers within reach of a much needed touchdown.\nRookie RB Jarryd Haye with biggest run of career: 8-yard gain on 3rd-and-1. #49ers\n— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) October 12, 2015 In a similar excitement, Hayne’s 16-yard punt return minutes after the score left csnbayarea.com writer Matt Maiocco marvelling at his quick feet.\nHayne is Australian for ankle-breaker.\n— Matt Maiocco (@MaioccoCSN) October 12, 2015 Regular 49ers reporter Can Inman praised Hayne’s drive to the line, following the exit of veteran running back Reggie Bush with an aggravated calf injury.\nInman described the Aussie’s rush as keeping “alive a game-tying touchdown drive”, which saw quarterback Colin Kaepernick throw a three-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Anquan Boldin just two minutes later.\nG&apos;day Australia: rookie Jarryd Hayne converts third-and-1 run and makes it 8 yards to the Giants&apos; 4-yard line. First carry in forever\n— Cam Inman (@CamInman) October 12, 2015 Matt Barrows of The Sacramento Bee felt Hayne had minimal impact in the match, and held the Aussie’s quiet display down to his side’s defensive effort.\n“Jarryd Hayne provided a boost with a 16-yard return in the third quarter. But the defence didn’t force enough punts for Hayne to make an impact,” Barrows wrote.\nTHE HAYNE PLANE — ‘I WAS CLOSE’\nTHE former Parramatta Eels full-back spoke after the game of coming tantalizingly close to his first ever NFL points, saying he felt “something special was going to happen.”\n“I just thought something was going to happen tonight. Something special was going to happen and I was just two or three yards short,” Hayne said.\n“I was close. We’re getting there every week. As a return unit we always talk about touchdowns and taking it to the endzone.”\nReggie Bush’s injury left the door open for Hayne to step into the running back role. Source: Reuters\nHayne posted a photo to his Instagram account following the match, admitting he was disappointed with the loss and acknowledging the support from a fan of his former NRL club Parramatta.\n“Making the most of my opportunities. Tuff loss against the Giants! Close losses are the worst. Good to see a parra Jersey before warm up tonight,” Hayne wrote.\nMaking the most of my opportunities. Tuff loss against the Giants! Close losses are the worst. Good… https://t.co/aVtpJtPQmG\n— jarryd hayne (@JarrydHayne) October 12, 2015 49ERS AND COACH JIM TOMSULA\nTHE San Francisco coach had little to say about his side’s fourth consecutive loss, and did not mention the 27-year-old rookie in a brief two-minute press conference.\n“Obviously we’re disappointed,” Tomsula said.\n“We didn’t make enough plays today.\n“Obviously that was much better, but again it was a loss. I have real problems taking anything good out of a loss… but I feel like there were some steps made.\n“We will stay together. That’s a good group of guys in there made of the right sort of stuff. We’ll hold tight together and keep going through it.”\nStar quarterback Colin Kaepernick shared a similar disappointment, but was optimistic his team could make it through the next 11 games undefeated.\n“To me, there’s still 11 games to go,” he said.\n“We have an opportunity to go 12-4. That’s what I’m aiming for. We have to start that streak and get ourselves on that path.”\nWith Hayne receiving more game time following the departure of Reggie Bush, reports remained unclear as to whether the 30-year-old had suffered injury serious enough to open the door for the Aussie to see added minutes next week against the Baltimore Ravens.\n“Our injury report, Reggie’s calf got tight. That was all we had,” Tomsula said.\nColin Kaepernick was clearly disappointed in notching a 1-4 record with his side’s loss to the New York Giants. Source: AP\nCOLIN SCOTTS — HAYNE WILL SCORE\nFORMER Arizona Cardinals defensive end Colin Scotts spoke with Fox Sports following the 49ers defeat at the hands of the Giants. Scotts, Australia’s second ever NFL player, said he was certain the rugby league convert would get points on the board in the coming weeks.\n“I will make you a promise, Australia. In a few weeks you will see him score a touchdown. Just to see him run like that against the No. 1 run defence in the NFL, the palm-off, the body leverage, everything,” Scotts said.\n“Good on him. He got limited opportunities. This is a brilliant run.\nTo see him do that on punt return is just brilliant.”\nThe 52-year-old praised Hayne for his quick progression in the game, and called for the Aussie to see more time on the pitch.\n“This is his fifth game and to do what he’s just done on punt return there, a 16-yard gain, that’s brilliant. They’re showing him so much respect that they are kicking to the sides. It was an Aussie kicking to an Aussie which is a wonderful story.\n“No other punt returner would actually catch that ball. That’s what’s so wonderful. He caught that ball on the sideline. Every other returner would have run the other way. He caught it and somehow got 16-yards from it.\n“I just wish he could get more opportunities.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fc843a1ed4ba026eeac3316d17b64d12", "http://t.co/sQZ8gVEXOk", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaynePlayne?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/49ers/status/653397228208455681", "https://twitter.com/itsCrab/status/653394379873353729", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaynePlane?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/49ers?src=hash", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "https://twitter.com/marctorrence/status/653394344293101568", "https://twitter.com/AaronNagler/status/653398405700562944", "https://twitter.com/nfldraftscout/status/653397322869555200", "https://t.co/aVtpJtPQmG", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F12%2FDVU_1210_NFL_WING_PUNTS_TO_HAYNE.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "https://twitter.com/Eric_Branch/status/653394019238694913", "https://twitter.com/si_nfl/status/653397582459224065", "http://t.co/aB1gogufck", "https://twitter.com/nfldraftscout/status/653396299270586368", "https://twitter.com/JarrydHayne/status/653465493110714368", "https://twitter.com/NFL/status/653394151803744256", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/51ad5e726a813ed4d47f0faae56eabf9", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ab871d913c7f3031626c4512bce02d3b", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SFvsNYG?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/AnquanBoldin", "https://twitter.com/CamInman/status/653393993586343936", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F12%2FDVU_1210_NFL_HAYNE_MAKES_INROADS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/article38792655.html", "http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2015/10/11/49ers-jarryd-hayne-nearly-scores-first-td-in-place-of-injured-reggie-bush/", "https://twitter.com/MaioccoCSN/status/653396235315900416"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:50:25.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
