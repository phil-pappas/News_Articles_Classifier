They have been hurt by turnovers in the last two losses, with a combined five giveaways in those two games.\nThe Raiders expect running back Latavious Murray to return after he missed part of the loss to Denver in Week 5. He could exploit a Chargers unit that is ranked 27th in rushing defense. The Raiders also plan to challenge Chargers CB Brandon Flowers, who has struggled in coverage this season.\nChargers quarterback Philip Rivers completed 43 passes and threw for 503 yards and two touchdowns in a 27-20 loss to Green Bay last week. Rivers is on pace to break Drew Brees' single-season completion record and Peyton Manning's record for passing yards. Rivers is salivating at the opportunity to throw against a Raiders defense that is allowing 299 passing yards a game.\nThe problem for the Chargers is they are one-dimensional on offense. They are ranked first in passing in the NFL, but 26th in rushing.\nIf you want to watch the Raiders play at San Diego, here's what you need to know:\nWhat : Oakland Raiders at San Diego Chargers\nWhere : Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, CA\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 25, 1:05 p.m. PT/4:05 p.m. ET\nTV : No local broadcast.
