Not so much Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll reacts to a play in the second half of an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in Seattle. The Panthers defeated the Seahawks 27-23. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) more > By BARRY WILNER - Associated   \nThe NFC West standings make little sense. At the bottom are the two teams that have dominated the division for years. \nYet there sit Seattle and San Francisco, both 2-4 as they head into Thursday night’s game at Levi’s Stadium. \nWhat gives? \nIn Seattle, the once fearsome defense does late in games. In San Francisco, the overhauling of the roster, particularly so many retirements by key players, has hurt. \nStill, this is one of the league’s nastiest rivalries, even with Jim Harbaugh gone from the Bay Area. \nSeahawks All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman doesn’t long to see Harbaugh or sparring partner Michael Crabtree, the wide receiver now in Oakland. \n“I’m not going to miss either, because I think I’m still playing,” Sherman said. “When you’re playing this game, you try not to worry about other people as much as you worry about what you can do and what your team does. … So I don’t think I think about either of those guys very much.” \nJim Tomsula, Harbaugh’s replacement as Niners coach, has plenty to think about in this matchup. \n“They still have their fiery attitude,” Tomsula said. “It’s a really good team. There’s no mistake about that. I know the record is the record, but the Seahawks are very good.” \nSeattle (No. 15 in AP Pro32) is a 6-point choice at No. 23 San Francisco. \nBEST BET: SEAHAWKS, 24-13 \n___ \nKNOCKOUT LEAGUE TIP: \nLast week’s pick never seems in danger of losing. With NEW ENGLAND now taken, next recommendation in the survivor sweepstakes is rebounding ARIZONA. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:52:22.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
