TMZ has the details :\nTMZ Sports spoke with Brennan Williams ... who's decided to call it quits on a 3 year NFL career as a lineman for the Texans, Jaguars, and Patriots so he can take a shot at pro wrestling.\nBrennan tells us that he won't be stepping into the ring blind 'cause he's gonna have Booker T -- a WWE hall of famer -- showing him the ropes (and turnbuckles) of the grappling game.\n\"He’s got a school in Houston called WXF that I’m joining (along with) his promo company.\"\nWilliams says he and Booker T have a vision ... one that involves him locking arms with the big boys very soon.\n\"I’m looking to get my feet wet while training with Booker and shooting for a contract with the WWE in January. That’s my plan.\"\nBrennan has evidently been a huge wrestling fan for years, and is so excited about the prospect of joining the WWE that he's already posting potential uniform designs.\nAww yeahhh pic.twitter.com/tQawlfltN6\n— Brennan Williams (@GREATBLACKOTAKU) October 22, 2015 Send all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com\n[ via Uproxx ]", "external_links": ["https://t.co/tQawlfltN6", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/25/wwe-booker-t-brennan-williams-wrestling-training/", "https://twitter.com/GREATBLACKOTAKU/status/657329661056294913", "http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/2015/10/brennan-williams-pro-wrestling-training-booker-t/", "http://www.tmz.com/person/brennan-williams/"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:25:37.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
