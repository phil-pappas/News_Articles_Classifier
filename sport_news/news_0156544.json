(Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images) As the 2015 season winds down to a merciful end for the Padres, there are many questions concerning how the team’s roster will change in the coming months. Four players in particular made their case during Thursday’s 3-1 victory over the Brew Crew. Let’s take a look at all four of these players and why they should play key roles with the 2016 Padres. Infielder Yangervis Solarte provided a 2-run homer in the bottom of the 3rd inning to give the Friars a 2-0 lead. The former Yankee has been inconsistent but when he’s on – he’s on. If he can be more Hyde than Jekyll, he can cement himself as the guy at 3rd base. The Padres acquired Solarte in 2014 when they sent Chase Headley to the Bronx. He has 15 homers and 64 RBI this season while holding a .274 batting average. If he can boost those numbers closer to 23 HR / 85 RBI / .290 next year, the Friars have a solution at that position. Rookie outfielder Travis Jankowski started in right field and made two great defensive plays. He threw out fellow rookie Michael Reed at the plate as he tried to score from second base on a single in the 3rd. Jankowski also ran into the right field railing and caught a foul ball to rob Jason Rogers in the 4th inning. Starting pitcher Ian Kennedy loved it so much he tipped his cap immediately and rightly so. Jankowski has flashed his speed on the bases and in the field over the past month since getting promoted from Triple-A El Paso. His batting average is not where he wants it to be (.210 as of Thursday evening) after collecting multiple hits in his first few major league games, but in my book the Padres should pencil him in as the starting centerfielder next season. They can flank the youngster with 100-RBI right fielder Matt Kemp and either Justin Upton (if they re-sign him to play left field) or Wil Myers (if they put him in there instead of 1st base). Cory Spangenberg reached base his first 3 at-bats, providing 2 singles and a walk. His second hit knocked in Derek Norris to give the Padres a 3-0 advantage. The Padres desperately need more speed in the lineup and in the field if they are going to get their offense going next season. If you need another example of how Spangenberg can help the Friars in years to come - just think of him hustling for a triple Wednesday after smacking the ball into the right field corner. Those types of plays - and players that provide them - have been few and far between this year at Petco Park. Spangenberg and Jankowski were both 1st round draft picks by San Diego. Spangenberg was selected 10th overall in 2011 and Jankowski 44th overall in the supplemental part of the 2012 opening round. Since they were drafted so high you would think they have a longer leash to prove they belong in the bigs as a part of the team's long-term future. Especially since the Padres have not exactly had a lot of success with 1st round picks the past decade. Not only was it Kennedy’s last start of the year, it might have been his last game in a Padres uniform. His one-year 9.8 million dollar contract runs out after the Dodgers series and he becomes an unrestricted free agent. Kennedy was on point against the Brewers, notching 11 strikeouts over 6 innings. He only allowed a solo homer to pinch hitter Shane Peterson. Even with the impressive outing, Kennedy finishes 2015 with an underwhelming 9-15 record and an ERA of 4.28. Speaking of the Dodgers, if the Padres sweep LA in their final series of the year, they will equal last season’s record of 77 wins and 84 losses. The Dodgers could be resting many of their starters since they already clinched the NL West division and already know they will be facing the New York Mets in the NLDS. Fox Sports San Diego reporter Kris Budden announced towards the end of Thursday's game that she will be leaving the Padres TV crew at the end of this season. She said on-air that her husband accepted a new job as an assistant tennis coach at Pepperdine University and that they are moving to Los Angeles. Budden also said she will continue to work for various NFL game broadcasts and with Fox Sports coverage of the San Diego State Aztecs.
