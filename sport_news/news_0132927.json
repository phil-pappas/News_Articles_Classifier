The players were treated by a 25-member multi-disciplinary therapist team, hailing from practices throughout the U.S. and Europe .\nDesigned for football players with a predisposition to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), the five-day intensive clinical pilot began on September 24th at the Upledger Institute International headquarters. The intensive manual therapy program utilized CranioSacral Therapy, Visceral Manipulation, Neural Manipulation and other healing modalities aimed at helping the body heal itself.\nCranioSacral Therapy is a gentle, hands-on treatment modality that releases tensions deep in the body to relieve pain and dysfunction and improve whole-body health and performance. Developed by Osteopathic Physician John E. Upledger, therapists focus upon the removal of restrictive forces within the membrane system surrounding the surface of the brain, the bones of the skull and vertebral column, including the sacrum and coccyx.\nThe objective of this study is to demonstrate that advanced therapies administered by certified, licensed manual therapists will help to alleviate the symptoms of post concussion syndrome. Pre and post assessments were conducted on all players.\nRicky Williams , who played professional football for 12 seasons and, like all players, suffered repeated trauma to his head and body during his career, strongly supports this pilot program. In describing one of his best seasons ever, Williams said, \"Before the 2009 football season, I went through the CranioSacral Intensive Program at The Upledger Institute looking to deal with some nagging physical complaints I had from past injuries. I ended up getting the relief I was looking for and much more. I credit much of my wellbeing and my 1000-yard season to the multi-modality manual therapy program I experienced at Upledger.\"\nAt the conclusion of this week's program, all former football players reported feeling much better physically and mentally and showed substantial improvement in their post evaluations. According to John Matthew Upledger , CEO of Upledger Institute International, \"Our hope is that the NFL will take note of the player's reported improvements and embrace these techniques, so that others suffering from pain and dysfunction can gain access to this treatment and experience the same positive outcomes.\nAbout the Upledger Institute Clinic\nThe Upledger Institute Clinic is recognized worldwide for the care provided by their multi-disciplinary team comprised of osteopaths, chiropractors, physical therapists, massage therapists, doctors of acupuncture and medical qigong, and mental health counselors - all integrating CranioSacral Therapy, Visceral Manipulation and Neural in their areas of expertise.
