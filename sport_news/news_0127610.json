He said I should do this because the film is completely different from Jai Ho ,\" Daisy told reporters.\nThe actress was speaking at the trailer launch of Hate Story 3, which also stars Sharman Joshi, Karan Singh Grover and Zarine Khan.\nThe 31-year-old actress, who made her Bollywood debut as a bubbly girl opposite Salman, said she was aware that the shift to erotic-thriller was not a \"safe\" choice.\"As an actor, one should be open to all kinds of roles. This is something I have pushed myself further with.This is not a safe zone but I wanted to try it and I did it.\"\nZarine, who also made her debut with the Dabangg star in Veer , said Salman was not aware for a long time that she was doing Hate Story 3.\nThe actress, who appeared in the song Character Dheela and starred in Houseful 3, was initially sceptical to sign the film, directed by Vishal Pandya.\n\"I was very skeptical in the beginning. But then I met Vishal and he narrated me the script. Over a period of time we became really good friends and I think he has great convincing powers. But yes, in the beginning I was a little skeptical.\"\nWritten by Vikram Bhatt and Madhuri Banerji, the film is a sequel to Pandya's 2014 thriller Hate Story 2 and third instalment of the franchise.\nHate Story 3 is scheduled to release on December 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:48:19.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
