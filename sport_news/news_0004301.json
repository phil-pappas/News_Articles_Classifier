Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff MARIETTA — Walton and Lassiter were evenly matched in the first set of Thursday’s Area 5 championship match at Pope.But once Walton clinched the first set, the best-of-five match was no longer even.The Lady Raiders generated long service runs and made the Lady Trojans play out of their comfort zone just to keep up. Lassiter had some life to start the third set, but Walton eventually seized control to defend its area crown with a 25-22, 25-8, 25-12 victory.Thursday’s match played similarly to Wednesday, when Walton (32-4) beat Lassiter 25-23, 25-14 in the winners’ bracket semifinals. “What has happened in the last two matches is that they come out in second set and they get a five- to eight-point lead, and they are a great front-running team,” Lassiter coach Greg Hodge said. “We then try a little harder, you try to make couple of more plays, and then, the next thing you know, you’re down 12.”The teams will return to action Thursday for the first round of the Class state playoffs. Walton will host the No. 4 seed of Area 8 , with Lassiter hosting the No. 3 seed.Pope, Woodstock and Etowah rounded out the five playoff-bound teams of Area 5 .Lassiter (28-8) led the first set 22-21 before Walton won four straight points and claimed the set on a pair of Tai Bierria kills, followed by back-to-back aces by Dalaney Hans.Walton opened the second set with an ace by Celeste Fitzgerald, then went up 2-0 when Lassiter was called for a double hit. The Lady Raiders came through with a couple of key blocks before a Lassiter hitting error, another double-hit call and a serve-receive miscue allowed them to take a 9-3 lead. The hole only got deeper and deeper for the Lady Trojans once Walton got in its offensive rhythm and expanded its second-set lead to 17-3.“The second set was just about staying relaxed and believing in our training and believing in each other rather than worrying so much about what was coming at us,” Walton coach Suzanne Fitzgerald said. “Once we took that emphasis and put it back on us and believing in each other, we were able to play with more confidence.”Bierria led Walton with 18 kills, mixing it up with hard-hit balls, taps and dumps. Holding on to a 13-10 third-set lead, Walton went on a three-point run on Bierria’s serve to get separation, and Lassiter failed to win a service point the rest of the match. Another Walton service run opened up a 22-11 lead.Reilly MacNeill finished with eight kills for Walton, while Gabby Gonzales and Riley Spurlin ended up with seven each. Meghan Froemming led with three aces, while Hans had 37 assists.The front-row defense stood out for Lassiter as Micah Ensore had a block and two block-assists. Alexus Holt chipped in with 1½ blocks, and Libby Bochniak had two solo blocks to go with her eight kills. Kate Gordon had two block-assists and 15 assists.
