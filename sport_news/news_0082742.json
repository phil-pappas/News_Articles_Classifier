Robinson has already rushed for 478 yards in less than half a game this season — a game which Lutheran won 95-28. Lutheran (5-0) scored 62, 76, 49 and 60 points in its other games against obviously overmatched competition. \"It gets hard sometimes because you want to be a good sport,\" Lutheran coach Bruce Baszali told Sauk Valley Media, \"but yet you want James to have his carries for the record. You get torn in what to do, and you try to find a balance in that.\" He had 310 yards last week to up his totals to 1,571 this season and 8,155 in his four-year varsity career. Caleb Pratt of Westville rushed for 8,477 yards from 2004-07.\nPath to dream final\nThe projection by veteran Kankakee Daily-Journal reporter Steve Soucie that has No. 1 Homewood-Flossmoor and No. 2 Loyola meeting in the Class 8A semifinals assumes that not only will H-F and Loyola run the table, but Barrington and Huntley will as well. A loss by either would put H-F and Loyola in position to meet in the final if both hold up their end of the bargain. Barrington plays undefeated Conant this week on Saturday and still has meetings with Palatine (4-1) and Fremd (4-1). Huntley's next two opponents are Jacobs (5-0) and Crystal Lake South (4-1).\n7A should be stacked\nNo. 4 Glenbard West could be back in its familiar position as a 7A favorite after making the jump to 8A last year, and they may have company on the way down. Soucie projects Simeon and Maine South to join Glenbard West in 7A. With No. 3 Mount Carmel, No. 8 Libertyville, No. 12 Lincoln-Way East and No. 14 Batavia also in 7A, the difference between 7A and 8A seems more or less negligible. Why are there so many classes again?\nLibertyville letdown?\nLibertyville better guard against an emotional letdown following its biggest win in years, a 35-7 coup against defending North Suburban Lake and Class 8A champion Stevenson. Lake Zurich hasn't been quite the same the past two seasons after a remarkable run, but count on coach David Proffitt having the Bears prepared to defend Libertyville and its running QB Riley Lees . Lake Zurich (2-3) has an explosive offensive player of its own in Ben Klett and a 14-year playoff streak to protect. The Bears would have to sweep Mundelein (3-2), Lake Forest (3-2) and Warren (3-2) if they fall to 2-4.\nHelfgot's football blog: The fantastic four games yet to be played Mike Helfgot In the blink of an eye, five games are in the books, which means a majority of teams (those that miss or exit early from the playoffs) have reached or surpassed the midway point of the season.\nHomewood-Flossmoor and Loyola, Riley Lees and Michael Johnson, the East Suburban Catholic and the West...\nIn the blink of an eye, five games are in the books, which means a majority of teams (those that miss or exit early from the playoffs) have reached or surpassed the midway point of the season.\nHomewood-Flossmoor and Loyola, Riley Lees and Michael Johnson, the East Suburban Catholic and the West...\n(Mike Helfgot) Mike Helfgot is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Barrington Sports High School Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dc32d/turbine/ct-spt-1001-prep-fb-helfgot-blog-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560da7c4/turbine/ct-spt-1002-prep-fb-week-6-four-downs-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:26:49.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
