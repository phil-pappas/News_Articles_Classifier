As we become consumed with the potential for The Men this fall, it might be fun (or at least instructive) to make the half-empty argument . As in, why 6-0 isn't as impressive as it seems. \nI'm not saying I buy this (I don't). I'm saying there is room, after six games, to make the case. And if BengalFan knows anything, it's this: Expect the worst, and you'll never be disappointed. \nThere are a few ways to go about this: \n1. Question the staying power of A. Dalton . He is playing out of his mind. He leads the league in yards per attempt if you don't count Ben, and I don't given he has missed three games, Dalton is 2nd in INTs with two (only Brady is better), he is tied for 2nd in TD passes, he is No. 1 in ESPN's QBRatings. \nIs he that good? Can he be that good across 16 games? \n2. Question the health . How long will it last? The league is a busted-up place to be at the moment. Not here. Maybe it's karma, for all the injury issues the Bengals had last year. Health is mainly luck, good and bad. \n3. The vagaries of the schedule . The Bengals played Oakland in its first game under a new coach/system etc. They played the Ravens in their first game without T. Suggs. Buffalo was a field hospital disguised as a football team. And so on. The Men won't be so lucky Nov.1, when Roethlisberger is supposed to be back for the Stillers. \n4. Wins that appeared impressive when they occurred aren't so much now: The Men should have beaten Oakland, and they did. \n5. The Ravens are 1-5, and would be 0-6 if Matt Scobee could kick. \n6. The Chargers are 1-3 since the Bengals beat them, their only W a 3-pointer v. the Browns, in San Diego. \n7. Kansas City is freefalling. \n8. Seattle has blown five fourth-quarter leads, so maybe the Bengals 4th q rally wasn't that mighty. \n9. And the Bengals caught Buffalo when the Bills were banged up and dysfunctional. \nFor every argument, there is a counter. The O-line is absolutely dealing , neutralizing three fearsome pass rushing teams in a row. No team left on the schedule (except possibly Denver) poses a similar problem. \nThe Bengals will get a huge boost when a healthy and rested V. Burfict returns. \nThey're scoring tons with little input from J. Hill. \nThey own every intangible: Confidence, trust, selflessness etc. \nThe back end of the schedule could be taxing: Two with Pittsburgh, two with the improving Brownies, at Arizona. It also has a few three-foot putts: Home v. Houston, St. Louis and Baltimore. And you have to think they'll beat the Browns at least once. At SF isn't the challenge it would have been in previous years. \nAt 6-0, the chance to finish 12-4 is decent, and usually 12-4 gets you no worse than a 1st-round home game and maybe a 1st-round bye. \nSomething to ponder as The Men say Bye-bye for a week. \nBEYOND THE STRIPES exceeded the normal goofy quotient last night, and that is saying something. We had Nugent, Huber and Clark Harris on, three fabulous guys who willingly subjected themselves to our foolishness. Let's just say you've never seen Family Feud played the way it was played at Moerlein Tuesday night. \nAgain: If the show stunk, I'd say it. It never does . We care a little about Xs and Os, enough that we devote a segment to talking football. It runs 10 minutes. We spend the other half hour peeling away the football layer and dealing with the players as individuals with personalities and quirks like the rest of us. \nIt's interesting. They're interesting. \nNext Tuesday: Hue Jackson . Is there anyone more compelling right now than the OC? Cincinnati Bengals specialists Mike Nugent, Kevin Huber and Clark Harris on Cincinnati.com's Beyond the Stripes, presented by JosephAuto.com from The Moerlein Lager House. The Enquirer/Glenn Hartong \nMoving right along. . . \nTHIS IS COOL. ON A SLOW NEWS DAY . .. The Bengals helmet, if designed by Marvel Comics. \nPITINO FIRES BACK . . .In an interview with ESPN, he puts all the blame on Andre McGee: \n\"This is all about money. People will say and do anything for money,\" Pitino said of the book. \"If these things are not true, and I keep using the word if, there's only one person who can give solutions to these problems: It's Andre McGee. \n\"It's time to give back to his team, his university and coaches and tell the NCAA the truth and tell everyone else, who was one time very proud of him, the truth. He owes that to his parents, to his university, to his teammates and his coaches. This is not only an NCAA issue here. It's more than that; there's more to it -- his teammates that believed in him, his coaches that believed in him, the community that believed in him, put our trust in him to do the right things.\" \nThat'd be nice, if McGee did all that. But let's be straight here: Fair or not, the damage has been done, and ultimately that damage is on Pitino. It's his corporation: Ville Inc . As I wrote for this AM's TM: It might not be Pitino's fault; it is his problem . \nIt bends the imagination to believe the head coach didn't have any idea this stuff was going down for four years and 22 parties, according to the author/madam, Katina Powell. It bends it further to think that none of it happened at all. \nIf any of this stuff is true, it wasn't just McGee who let down UofL. It was every kid who took part, every person who enabled it (it wasn't just McGee forking over the $500 per sex act that Powell says was the going rate) and, ultimately, Pitino himself. It's his team. \nYOU GUYS ARE ON IT. . . Yesterday, I praised the show Fargo and posed the rhetorical question: Who hits a pedestrian while driving, then drives home with said pedestrian's body half on the hood and half in the front seat? \nThree Mobsters gave me an answer. From Mobster Jack: \nOctober, 2001, Ft. Worth Texas. A homeless man named Gregory Biggs was struck by a nurse, Chante Mallard. She drove home, left man in windshield, he died. She is presently in prison on a manslaughter charge. \nThis, from AP, in March 2002: \nA nurse's aide hit a homeless man with her car, drove home with him stuck headfirst in her broken windshield and ignored his cries for help as he bled to death in her garage over the next two or three days, police say. \nChante Mallard allegedly told police she periodically went into the garage, apologizing to him but doing nothing to help. \nTHERE IS STILL BASEBALL BEING PLAYED. I SWEAR. \nChicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon after a pitching change in the 8th inning against the New York Mets in game one of the NLCS at Citi Field. (Photo: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports) \nNever met Maddon, seems like a cool guy. But at what point does all his different-ness start coming off as posed? \nMeantime, the October of Daniel Murphy continues unabated. And it occurs that more than ever , October success is a lot of serendipity, pitching and who's hot at the right time. \nBaseball's regular season is the best in all of pro sports, and also the least rewarded. The Mets young-gun pitchers are carving the heart outta the young-gun Cubs hitters. And after Arrieta and Lester, the Cubs don't offer much quality pitching. \nAre the Mets a better overall team than Chicago? The regular season says no. Were the Mets the best team in the NL across the Big 162? Not even close. But they can pitch and they're hot. And D. Murphy, a good not great player, is crushing it. \nSo, I guess the formula is, build a team that's capable of winning 88-90 games, and thus capable of reaching the playoffs. (It helps if you play in a lousy division, too.) Have great young arms, even if they're untested. And hope for Everyman to play like Daniel Murphy. \nThat way, you can render irrelevant teams that win 97, 98 and 100 games in the regular season. \nI'm not whining, I swear. Well, yeah, maybe I am. \nCan't MPWS transfer to the NL East? Move ATL to the Central. \nOn that note. . . \nTUNE O' THE DAY . . . a very good friend of mine is struggling, and I don't know how to help him. So, here's a tune. Always here for you, my friend. \nYou've been down the long way/ \nYou know times are tough/ \nBut if you search your heart/ \nYou'll find enough Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1RW1WDr Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:23:57.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
