We weren’t sure if we were going to do it. It went and then we happened to bust a play off that, so that juiced us obviously.” \nFrauenheim’s touchdown run came as the Garnett Gulls ran iso to the weak side after running iso to the heavy side earlier in the game. \nHe finished with a game-high 114 yards on 22 carries, while three other backs combined for 46 yards on 18 attempts (Jason Bowers, who doubles as an outside linebacker, did not play offense in the second half due to an injury). \nWagner and his staff made a concerted effort to dumb down the offense for his young team, which features three sophomores and a junior in the backfield. \n“This is a game of adjustments,” Wagner said. “We are so young back there and we have struggled making adjustments. It’s hard. We do a lot of motion and stuff. We did hardly any motion today, just because it confused our kids. I put that on the coaches. We tried to take them to a place where we are not ready yet. We have a great future.” \nSpotswood immediately answered Frauenheim’s touchdown run, scoring on its first series of the second half as Joe Hayford capped a 68-yard, seven-play drive with a three-yard touchdown run, closing the deficit to 17-7 with 8:50 remaining in the third quarter. \nThe key play of the march was Hayford’s 45-yard run, the only big play Point Pleasant Beach allowed in the entire game, which starkly contrasted the three big plays the Garnett Gulls allowed in a 21-7 loss to Keyport one week prior. \n“We’ve been killed by the big play all year,” said Wagner, noting that limiting such plays was a point of emphasis, as well as controlling the clock. “We wanted to shorten the game.” \nThe Chargers, who entered the contest averaging 32.7 points, ran just 12 offensive plays and mustered just one first down – on the final play of the second quarter – in the opening half. \nSpotswood was outgained 117 to 40 in first-half yards from scrimmage and was outgained 177 to 126 for the game. \nPoint Pleasant Beach took a 3-0 lead on Sean Gould’s 38-yard field goal with 2:22 left in the first half. He capped a 51-yard drive on which Frauenheim rushed four times for 28 yards. \nSpotswood’s defense, which lineman Lou Vacca, who recorded five tackles for a loss, anchored, gave the offense opportunities to claw back into the game. Point Pleasant Beach punted four times after the intermission and did not convert a second-half first down until the game’s final play. \nThe Chargers, who had poor field position for much of the contest, starting seven possessions on average at their own 25 yard line, hurt themselves with five offensive penalties. \n“We had trouble getting going on offense,” Cammarano said, echoing the sentiments of Wagner regarding Spotswood also needing to simplify its Wing-T offense. \n“We made a lot of mistakes in terms of penalties or personnel. With all the motions we do and stuff, sometimes we mess that up. The credit goes to them because they executed and we didn’t. But when you talk about unforced errors – boy, we owned that category. We’ve got a lot to fix. We’ve got a lot to simplify. We’ve got to keep our heads up.” \nNot built to rally from a 17-point deficit, the run-oriented Chargers, whose calls this season have been 77 percent running plays, completed 6 of 10 passes for 60 yards. \nQuarterback Shawn O’Connor faced a heavy pass rush in the second half, was sacked three times and flagged twice for intentional grounding. \nBoth teams are now 2-2. \nKey play: Kells’ 40-yard interception return with a minute left in the first half not only gave the Garnett Gulls a 10-point lead, but it provided a sizable cushion that allowed Point Pleasant Beach to successfully execute a squib kick to start the second half. \nOffensive game ball: Luke Frauenheim rushed for a game-high 114 yards on 22 carries, the most important of which led to his 38-yard touchdown on Point Pleasant Beach’s first play from scrimmage in the second half. \nDefensive game ball: Spotswood lineman Lou Vacca recorded a game-high five tackles behind the line of scrimmage and anchored a defense that did not allow the Garnett Gulls to record a second-half first down until the game’s final play. \nUp next: Point Pleasant Beach hosts Dunellen on Friday, while Spotswood hosts Holmdel on Saturday. \nPoint Pleasant Beach (2-2) 3-7-7-0 — 17 \nSpotswood (2-2) 0-0-7-0 — 7 \nP–Kells 40 interception return (Gould kick) \nP–Frauenheim 38 run (Gould kick) \nS–Hayford 3 run (Szatkowski kick) \nRushing: P – Frauenheim 22-114, Shea 8-16, Bowers 4-17, Nista 6-13; S – Hayford 13-76, Liu 5-5, O’Connor 5 –minus-15.
