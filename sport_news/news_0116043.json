They are second in the NFL in run defense and last in pass defense. Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford said those statistics are skewed because teams don't want to run on the Giants, so they throw more often. But quarterbacks have had success through the air. The Giants allow 314.2 passing yards per game, and opponents are attempting 43.4 passes. Bradford averages 256.2 yards per game and 38 attempts, and he is coming off his two best games of the season.\nThe Giants will be missing Prince Amukamara, who is out with a pectoral injury. But the Eagles will be down rookie receiver Nelson Agholor, who has an ankle injury. Josh Huff would see more work on the outside, but pay attention to inside targets Jordan Matthews and Zach Ertz. The Giants could turn to journeyman cornerback Trevin Wade in the slot, where Matthews plays; and the Giants have allowed 36 catches for 395 yards and four touchdowns to tight ends this season, so that could benefit Ertz. With Amukamara out, the Giants' top cornerback is former Eagle Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Despite giving up big yards, the Giants' pass defense has allowed only eight touchdowns in five games, which is middle of the pack this season. Their five interceptions put them in the top half of the league, but their seven sacks are in the bottom half.\nThe key to the Eagles' offensive revival last week was improved run blocking. Tackles Jason Peters and Lane Johnson were full participants in practice last week, an encouraging sign. The Eagles rushed for 186 yards and 5.5 yards per carry last week, and when the run game is working, the rest of the offense goes with it. Ryan Mathews, the Eagles' top rusher, is questionable with a groin injury. That could put more weight on the shoulders of DeMarco Murray, who showed positive signs last week with 83 rushing yards. The Giants' run defense is led by defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins. Starting linebacker Devon Kennard is out with a hamstring injury.\nMore coverage VOTE: Who will win Giants-Eagles game?

Last week, he missed his second extra point in two games with the team.\nWhen the Giants have the ball The major challenge for the Eagles defense will be stopping Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who is as hot as he's been since entering the league in 2004. Manning has 10 touchdowns and two interceptions in five games while completing 66.5 percent of his passes and averaging 289.4 passing yards. His 100.2 quarterback rating is the best of his career. Manning averages 2.26 seconds to release the ball, the fourth quickest in the NFL, according to Pro Football Focus. That has helped reduce sacks and create efficiency in the offense. But Drew Brees plays the same way, and the Eagles sacked him five times last week. Defensive end Fletcher Cox had three of those sacks, and the key is for the defensive backs to hold their coverage.\nManning will have a tougher time against the Eagles' defense if Odell Beckham Jr. doesn't play. Beckham has a hamstring injury and is listed as questionable, but the Eagles anticipate he will be in the lineup. If he's playing and healthy, Beckham is one of the toughest wide receivers in the NFL to cover. Byron Maxwell would likely see most of the work, although Beckham plays both sides, so Nolan Carroll could see him, too. The Giants are still missing slot receiver Victor Cruz, but Rueben Randle is probable. Randle has 19 catches for 217 yards and two touchdowns this season as the Giants' No. 2 wide receiver.\nThe Giants also can count on running back Shane Vereen, who has two eight-catch games this season. The Eagles must be mindful of dump-off passes to Vereen; the responsibility to cover those will be on rookie linebacker Jordan Hicks. Mychal Kendricks and Kiko Alonso are still out.\nThe Giants' runners average only 3.6 yards per carry. Rashad Jennings, the top running back, has 180 yards in five games. The Eagles' defensive line has helped hold opposing teams to 96.8 yards rushing per game.\nCox is the reigning NFC defensive player of the week. Manning won the offensive award last week, making this the first time the two reigning players of the week have faced each other since Week 16 last season.\nThe big number 21: That's how often Odell Beckham Jr. was targeted in a Week 17 game between the Eagles and Giants last season. Although the Eagles won that afternoon, Beckham finished with 12 catches for 185 yards and one touchdown. The Eagles' defense is different this season, but that game showed the type of threat Beckham is - and the way the Giants like to throw him - when the star receiver is in the lineup. Beckham's hamstring injury adds a wrinkle to this week's game. The Eagles believe Beckham, listed as questionable, will play, but if he's not his usual self it would an advantage for the Eagles. If he's on the field, though, Eli Manning will throw to him. Beckham is seventh in the NFL with 52 targets in five games this season.\nThe bottom line Zach Berman: Eagles 31, Giants 23\nJeff McLane: Giants 27, Eagles 26", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:47:57.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
