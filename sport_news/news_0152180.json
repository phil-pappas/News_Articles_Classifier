They have one weekend left to prove they deserve the chance. \nSan Jose concludes the exhibition season with games in Arizona on Friday and Anaheim on Saturday, and Tennyson, DeMelo and Mirco Mueller are locked in a competition to make the Sharks roster out of training camp. Only two of the three defensemen will stay, with the other ticketed for the San Jose Barracuda of the AHL. \nIn line rushes at Thursday's practice, Tennyson was paired with Brenden Dillon, and there's a chance the two could be together for one of two final preseason games. \n\"Not trying to do anything different, just because maybe it's the last time to make an impression,\" said Tennyson when asked if there's anything he wants to showcase. \"The biggest impression will be playing well all-around instead of trying to focus on one thing to do well.\" \nWhen camp began, the competition for the sixth and seventh defensemen spots figured to come down to Tennyson, DeMelo and Mueller. DeMelo started camp as a partner to Dillon on the third defensive pair, and Mueller was in that spot Tuesday against Vancouver. \n\"You're being evaluated every day,\" DeMelo said. \"Even during the year, you're competing with guys to move up in the lineup and get power play and penalty kill time.\" Advertisement \nIt's easy to forget that while the competition goes on, it's Dillon who is having to adjust to everyone's individual style. One of the three will be his partner against the Los Angeles Kings in Wednesday's opener, and he has to make sure he's on the same page with whomever he's paired with that night. \nDillon and Mueller are left-handed shots, and DeMelo and Tennyson shoot from the right side. \n\"I'm comfortable on the left or right side,\" Dillon said. \"Every game, you find things that your partners that maybe one guy does different than the other. I've felt really comfortable with all of them.\" \nThe Sharks will take all 26 players who remain in training camp, and probably a few more, according to coach Pete DeBoer, on the road trip. The competition for the final few forward positions continues as well, with Chris Tierney, Barclay Goodrow, Nikolay Goldobin, and perhaps even Ben Smith and Joonas Donskoi, all looking to secure opening-night spots. \nDonskoi skated again on the top line with Joe Thornton and Joe Pavelski on Thursday, so on the surface, it would appear his roster spot is safe. Tierney, Goodrow, Goldobin and Smith were all in fourth-line roles. \n\"It's a great spot for me. Tough spot if you're a player,\" DeBoer said. \"But that's the perfect situation from a coaching perspective.\" \nOf course, with the Barracuda locker room at Sharks Ice in San Jose just a few yards away from where the Sharks train, the NHL roster could, and likely will, fluctuate throughout the season. \n\"You've got daily competition,\" DeBoer said. \"Whoever we decide is going to be here, we're going to have a real hard push from underneath, and that's going to be all year.\" \nThe Sharks have killed 20 of 22 penalties this preseason, as they adjust to DeBoer's new style and terminology and seek to improve on last season's 78.5 percent success rate. \nThe Sharks killed all three penalties they took on Tuesday against Vancouver, and all but three players had time on the ice when the team was shorthanded. \n\"We're only 10 or 11 days into this, and we've thrown a lot of stuff at them,\" DeBoer said. \"It's been a real captive audience. They want to implement it, and they're getting better at it.\" For more on the Sharks, see the Working the Corners blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/sharks .
