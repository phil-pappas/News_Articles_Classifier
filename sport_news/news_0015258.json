(The other pits seventh-ranked Woodbridge at eight-ranked South Plainfield on Friday at 7 p.m.) \nFive teams in the top-heavy division, who have a combined 20-5 division mark, still have a chance to win the title outright or claim a share of the division crown, while the four teams at the bottom of the standings, who own a combined 2-17 division record, have been eliminated. \nThe division race remains wide open with New Brunswick (6-0 overall, 6-0 division) alone in first place, two games ahead of South Plainfield (4-1, 4-1) and Colonia (4-2, 4-1) in the win column, while St. Joseph (3-2, 3-1) and Woodbridge (4-2, 3-2) sit in third and fourth place, respectively. \nIncredibly, two of the five teams in contention have three games remaining against division contenders, while the other three teams in contention each have two games left against division contenders. \nThe remaining schedules for the White Division leaders include New Brunswick vs. Freehold Township, Colonia and St. Joseph; St. Joseph vs. Colonia, Woodbridge and New Brunswick; Colonia vs. St. Joseph, New Brunswick and South Plainfield; South Plainfield vs. Woodbridge, Perth Amboy and Colonia; and Woodbridge vs. South Plainfield, St. Joseph and Perth Amboy. \n“Since Week One we’ve been fighting for our life every single week,” Ransone said of his Falcons, who opened the year with a 29-7 loss to South Plainfield, during which they committed five turnovers on their own side of the field. “We have a great understanding that Colonia is in the same boat.” \nThe Patriots were stunned in a 14-6 loss to Carteret (1-5) during a nor’easter that made for field conditions not conducive to Colonia’s style of play out of the read option, which quarterback Chase Barneys runs exceptionally well. \n“He’s a dual threat and very tough to prepare for,” Ransone said of Barneys, who has passed (53 of 93 with 10 touchdowns and three interceptions) for 875 yards and rushed for 327 yards on 66 carries. \n“If you don’t play your keys the correct way, he can make you pay with his speed. He has the unique ability to keep plays alive with his feet, as well as beat you with his arm in and out of the pocket. He’s a great player.” \nRunning back Bashir Lauderdale (125 carries, 656 yards and six touchdowns), who has been a model of consistency, and an array of gifted receivers epitomize Colonia’s team speed, which poses matchup problems for some opponents. \nTyler Santos (310 yards), Bryce Barneys (259 yards), Brandon Benedicks (136 yards) and Solomon Manning (169 yards) each have more than 135 receiving yards for Colonia. \n“They are a threat to score on any given situation,” Ransone said. “They have the ability to beat you on one play. I don’t think there’s anything fancy about what they do. They are good at what they do, both running and throwing the football.” \nRoarty said Yakely’s ability to gain significant yardage on first or second down puts the Falcons in favorable second- and third-down situations from which sophomore quarterback Paul Cocozziello (44 of 93 for 740 yards and five touchdowns), who has been brilliant the past two weeks, benefits. \nManny Resto and Joe Papa complement Yakely (91 carries, 538 yards, five touchdowns) in the backfield. \n“They are back to being physical,” Roarty observed of St. Joseph, which has used the run to set up the pass, operating out of power and spread formations with equal effectiveness. “They want to move people up front. They don’t have the speed back like they did with (2013 Home News Tribune Player of the Year) Matt Olivo. They are very patient and playing with a lot of confidence. Casey’s done a nice job bringing them around.” \nSince throwing four interceptions in the opener, Cocozziello has “been very steady back there,” Roarty said. “He’s a pocket passer and doesn’t get rattled. He looks like he’s been running the offense for two or three years.” \nSt. Joseph has a sure-handed and gifted receiving corps that features Jon Sot, Mithcel Epstein and freshman Duke McDuffie. \nThe strength of Colonia’s defense is its veteran secondary, but Manning — one of the best linebackers in the state, who, like Krimin, has committed to Rutgers University — is the Patriots’ best defensive player. He leads the team with 69 tackles. \n“It’s a matter of slowing them down,” Roarty said of St. Joseph’s offense. “They are going to make their plays. We have to contain their big plays.” 38 CONNECT 30 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LOvSk0 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:54:16.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
