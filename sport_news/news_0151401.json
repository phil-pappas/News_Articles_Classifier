Yadav’s assertion comes on the heels of RJD’s Lalu Prasad declaring a few days ago that the election was a contest between forward and backward castes. He attributed the caste-based issues taking centre-stage in the Bihar elections to recent “casteist remarks” by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bhagwat. “Not only Bhagwat raised this issue…but even the Prime Minister in his first rally of Muzaffarpur in Bihar on July 25 mentioned that Yadhuvansis have been given poison in the state by the previous government…I am of the firm view that unless BJP stops debating on reservation policy, other castes will continue their demand against and for reservations, especially before each and every election in the country in future,” Yadav said. He said the reservation issues would have been solved, had Modi implemented his announcement to provide jobs to 2 crore youth every year. The JD-U chief upping the ante on caste-related issues was seen by many as an attempt to shore up the grand alliance’s poll prospects in the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:20:49.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
