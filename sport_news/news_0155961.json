However, neither team’s offense was able to break the goal line. \nFortunately for Northern New Jersey, Friday night was the worst we saw of Hurricane Joaquin. While many of us were inside keeping warm and dry, the Ridgers and the Bulldogs battled through the driving rain. \nGlen Ridge head coach Duke Mendez spoke about the conditions last Friday night and how it affected his team’s gameplan. \n\"The whole game was about field position because the weather was so bad, it poured the whole game so neither team could really throw the ball,\" Mendez said. \"So we forced them to throw into the wind the first quarter and we knew that if we could stop the run game we’d be in decent shape.\" \nThe Ridgers did just that limiting the Bulldog offense to just 62 yards on the ground. \nWith the game scoreless entering the second quarter, junior kicker Matt Myles drilled a 47-yard field goal with the wind at his back to put the Ridgers on the board 3-0. \nLater in the second quarter, the Ridgers had the Bulldogs pinned back deep against their own end zone. The shotgun snap sailed over the Bulldog quarterback and rolled out of the end zone resulting in a safety to push the Ridger lead to 5-0. \nWith the score remaining unchanged entering the fourth quarter, the Ridgers forced the Bulldogs to punt with their backs up against their own end zone. The snap sailed over the punter’s head, as he tried to retrieve the ball he stepped out of the end zone resulting in yet another safety to give the Ridgers a 7-0 lead they would not relinquish. \nWhen asked if he had ever seen a game as whacky as this one, Mendez told the Voice, \"Not like that, the weather was a huge factor and both teams struggled throwing the ball, but we did enough on offense and Matt Myles did a great job of pinning them down.\" \nOne facet of the game the Ridgers have been remarkably consistent with all season long has been their defense. \nThis was on full display last Friday night as sophomore Max Auborn had a tremendous game, registering two sacks and 13 tackles. Senior captain Mac Kortrey also had a strong game with a sack and 11 tackles as did his fellow senior captain Robert Spitaletta who sacked the QB once, made 11 tackles and picked off the QB once. \nJunior Owen Fincher had a great defensive game as well, getting to the QB once and making nine tackles. \n\"It’s about letting the kids play together and them understanding what we are doing,\" Mendez said. \"We put a lot of pressure on people with our stunts and we’ll play some man coverage.\" \nWith their fine defensive performance Friday night, the Ridgers improve to 1-3. All three of their losses came at the hands of programs that remain undefeated as we enter week five. \nUnfortunately, the Ridger’s first win of the year came at the expense of rising sophomore running back Joe Marchesano, who will miss the remainder of the season with a broken leg, an injury he sustained in the fourth quarter. \nSenior Teandre Russell-Rose will fill in for Marchesano the rest of the season and will utilize the break away speed he demonstrated in the spring for the Ridger’s track and field program. \nAnother scare came in the second quarter when it was believed senior QB Paddy McDermott may have fractured his arm, but according to Mendez he believes his starting QB avoided a season ending injury. McDermott will be limited in practice early on this week and if he progresses he should be good to go for Saturday’s game. \n\"I just wish offensively we would move the ball a little more,\" Mendez said of his club’s anemic offensive production. \"We’ve been struggling in our pass protection and our run game a little bit but defensively we’ve been great; special teams has been good too. We just need to get the offense going so we don’t have to play defense the whole game.\" \nThrough the Ridger’s first four games they have managed to score only 24 points. \nGlen Ridge will seek their second victory of the season this Saturday when they play host to the 0-5 Belleville Buccaneers at Hurrell Field for a 1 p.m. start. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:17:40.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
