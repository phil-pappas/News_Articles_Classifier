The Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader was today denied entry into Bisara village where UP administration has imposed prohibitory orders since September 28, when a mob lynched Mohamad Akhlaq on rumours of him having beef.\nThe right wing leader attempted to enter the village along with dozens of her supporters but was escorted out of Dadri by police teams that were trailing her from the moment she arrived in Dadri. The leader's entire cavalcade, which constituted of half-a-dozen cars, was followed by the police for almost 10 kms.\nFinally when the 'chase' ended at Dadri border, Sadhvi's supporters came onto the road and raised slogans against cow slaughter and demanded punishment for 'murderers of cows'.\n\"I wanted to meet families of Jay Prakash and Rahul Yadav but I was denied entry. I had requested the SDM in this respect. Rahul Gandhi can come here so can Owaisi, who comes from Hyderabad but I am the one who is denied entry,\"Sadhvi said.\nPrachi also targeted Uttar Pradesh Minister Azam Khan over his letter to the United Nations seeking its intervention to look into the \"miseries\" of minorities in India. She accused the Samajvadi Party leader of being a traitor and conspiring against the Hindu community. Sadhvi tried to get down from her car twice but could not move due to heavy police presence. Prachi also demanded compensation of Rs50 lakh each for the families of Yadav and Jay Prakash. \"Prakash was tortured to the extent that he committed suicide,\" she alleged.\nVHP was not the only group that was prevented from entering the village. Earlier in the day, members of Hindu Yuva Vahini, a group headed by BJP MP Yogi Adityanath was sent back by the police when its members tried to enter the village. Jitendra Tyagi, one of the members of the outfit while speaking to reporters said that his group is willing to help the villagers of Bisara in every way possible. In a veiled reference, the member said that his outfit will give guns to people who are being harassed by authorities.\n\"We will meet members of Hindu Samaj who are being harassed by authorities. We will provide them all possible help, be it tan-man-dhan-gun, if they are harassed,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the local administration claimed that the situation was calm in Bisara which has been out of bounds for media, after women and children chased reporters and videojournalists out of the village on Saturday last week. A peace meet was organised by the local administration which saw participation of deceased Mohamad Akhlaq's three brothers who addressed members of Hindu-Muslim community. The brothers appealed for peace and demanded that justice be done to Akhlaq's family by punishing the culprits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:45:21.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
