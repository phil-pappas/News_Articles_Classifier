She can be the first player to win all five majors... become the first person to win the grand slam.\n\"Thirteen wins on the LPGA tour in two years... that's ridiculous. This is like Tiger Woods stuff.\n\"He dominated golf for 10 years and I can see Lydia doing exactly the same thing.\"\nOne more major will make Ko her country's most accomplished golfer, while she will need another 14 to match the most prolific major winner in women's golf, American Patty Berg.\nKo's six-stroke win at Evian-Les-Bains in France ensured she will reclaim the world number one ranking, while receiving a huge boost of confidence after some disappointing performances at the majors.\n\"She is a great ambassador for golf and New Zealand,\" Campbell added.\n\"She has got 20 more years at the top which adds up to 100 majors. She will be distracted off the golf course but I'm sure she has a great team behind her.\n\"She can go on to bigger and brighter things.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-15T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:38:51.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
