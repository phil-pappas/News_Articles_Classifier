So his result is valid. He will be given the full-marathon champion's prize. We apologize for our neglect,\" said the organizers in a statement. \nThe organizers added the other finishers will have their places moved back one slot but they can keep their prize money. \nThe 29-year-old Shandong native will have his prize back in a few days. \n\"I want to thank my fellow runners, the media and all my friends who believe in me and supported me,\" said Gong on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:37:21.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
