Newton and Eastside are all but in the state playoffs, while Alcovy is fighting for its postseason life. \nHere we’ll take a look at each team as they stand currently and their outlook going for as far as playoff seeding goes. \nNewton Current region standing: No. 1 seed Remaining games: @Lovejoy, vs. Lakeside, vs. Rockdale Best-case scenario: Newton finishes 9-1 wins the region title and hosts the first two rounds of the playoffs. Worst-case scenario: The Rams drop all of their remaining games, finish as the No. 3 or No. 4 seed in the region and have to travel early in the playoffs. Likely scenario: see best-case scenario \nEastside Record: (5-2, 2-1) Current region standing: No. 1 seed Remaining games: @ Hampton, @ Walnut Grove, @/vs. either the No. 1/No. 3 seed from Region 4-AAAA division b Best-case scenario: Eastside wins out. Locust Grove drops two games and the Eagles beat Jonesboro to win the region title and to claim a No. 1 seed in the playoffs, with the first two games coming at home. Worst-case scenario: The Eagles lose their next two games, fall out of the region tournament picture and miss the playoffs completely. Likely scenario: Eastside wins out, remains the No. 2 seed on their side of the region, beats Spalding or Riverdale to claim the No. 3 seed and travels for the playoffs. \nAlcovy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:21:45.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
