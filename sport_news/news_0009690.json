Place. Photograph by: DARRYL DYCK , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nYouth will giveth, and every once in a while it will taketh away. \nBo Horvat was flying Saturday. \nCarrying the confidence of a player not afraid of making a mistake, fearless of being pinned to the bench because he took a risk, Horvat was all over the offensive zone. \nHe dogged the puck, pumped life into the second line and, more stunningly, into the Canucks second power-play unit. \nHe scored the Canucks’ first goal, shaking off the Flames best defenceman Mark Giordano, before picking a corner at the side of the net. \nBut he also chased a hit on Jiri Hudler in the the third period, clearing the middle of the ice for a Flames goal that tied the game at two. Calgary went on to win in overtime. \nIn the big picture, it hardly matters. With every NHL shift, Horvat is improving and his inching that ceiling ever higher. \nSix months ago his coach refused to put him in offensive situations. Now, you can’t imaging the Canucks power play without him. \nIn the pregame player introductions, only Henrik Sedin drew a louder cheer than Horvat. \nPeople can see what’s happening here. Heck, you can’t not notice Horvat every other shift. \nAmong the young players, he’s not alone. \nThe Canucks’ second goal was courtesy Jared McCann who had a “shot heard round Yaletown” when he nailed the top corner, over Jonas Hiller’s head. \nAnd by the second period, Ben Hutton was pairing with Chris Tanev, and they were Vancouver’s best pairing. \nNone of what happened Saturday looked easy. \nBecause Alex Edler, a surprise scratch to start the game, apparently because of an illness, the Canucks defence was without Edler, and with a whole lot of problems. \nWhen you’re trying to figure out the player the Canucks can least afford to lose this season to injury, you can slide Edler right near the top. \nWith Luca Sbisa and Matt Bartkowski already in the top six, the Canucks can’t afford to lose any of their big three, which includes Edler, Tanev and Dan Hamhuis. \nADVANCED STATS \n52.63% : This was the percentage of even-strength shot attempts the Canucks had when Ben Hutton was on the ice. It was another great start for defenceman Hutton. After two periods, he led all Canucks in shot differential. \n-16: It was not a good game for Dan Hamhuis. This was his Corsi. The Flames had 16 more shot attempts than the Canucks did when he was on the ice. \n28.57% : This was Jared McCann’s shot attempt differential for the game. Despite his goal, his line struggled to get possession. Much of that could be related to a weak performance by the Canucks defence. \n5:21: This was Brandon Prust’s time on ice in the first period. His line was caught out there on a couple of long shifts. It was not a great first period for him. Willie Desjardins responded by playing him just 2:19 in the second. \nWHAT THIS MEANS \nYou can book this right now: The Canucks are going to have a very difficult decision to make on Jared McCann. \nThe 19-year-old left fans drooling with a second-period snipe for what was his first NHL goal. \nThat type of shot has been virtually non-existent in Vancouver for years. Sure, there have been moments and Radim Vrbata is capable of hitting a corner like that with a snap shot. \nBut after Vrbata, there is no one who can do that regularly. \nFor way too long, the Canucks have lacked the skill it takes to hit holes on the fly from 30 feet out. McCann gives this team that with his quick-shot cannon. \nMcCann, who was listed at 174 pounds in training camp, is still a couple of years from developing physically. \nFew thought he’d be ready this year, and the Canucks lean has been to send him back to junior when Chris Higgins returns. \nBut how in the world can they turn their back on that shot? \nWHAT WE LEARNED \nIt’s time for Jake Virtanen. \nI can understand why the team kept the same lineup after the big win in Calgary. \nWhat right-thinking coach who change a thing after that complete domination? \nThis team, however, has the chance to be better with Virtanen. \nThere’s just too much speed and upside for the 19-year-old, while Brandon Prust is struggling to make an impact on the fourth line, mostly because his foot speed has not been there. \nAnd if Prust doesn’t have the wheels to do some damage on the forecheck, it’s time to see if Virtanen can make difference. \nWhat better spot to give Virtanen his opportunity to make his first big hit than in L.A. on Monday? \nYou know it’s coming. \nIN A WORD \nHEADER: Mason Raymond should have blown up in the first period. Ryan Miller made three great saves on him. None better than the one in which he used his mask to deflect a Raymond slapper harmlessly into the corner. \nDRAMATIC: Miller had some really nice saves, but the sweeping glove stop he made on Michael Frolic late in the second period was a shot stopper. The Flames pelted the net just after it, too, but couldn’t beat Miller. \nMEMORABLE: Not much better than seeing the late Richard Loney sing the anthem one last time. The Canucks started the game by showing clips of Loney singing the anthem on the scoreboard. « Previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:55:36.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
