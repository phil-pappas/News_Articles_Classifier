(AP) - State auditors say the New York Racing Association is failing to properly document capital plans, with problems persisting since its 2008 bankruptcy settlement.\nNYRA rejects the conclusions, saying its capital planning is rigorous and reviewed quarterly by an oversight board.\nAuditors say the nonprofit, which runs the Saratoga, Belmont and Aqueduct racetracks, has failed to adequately prioritize capital projects and estimate related costs funded by revenue from video lottery terminals at Aqueduct.\nIn the settlement, NYRA gave the state title to the racetracks in return for $54 million in debt forgiven, $80 million to pay off other debt and $25 million cash.\nFrom Jan. 1, 2012, through June 30, 2014, NYRA received $259 million from the casino, including $74 million for its capital program.\nOnline:\nhttp://www.osc.state.ny.us/audits/allaudits/093016/14s54.pdf\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.osc.state.ny.us/audits/allaudits/093016/14s54.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:36:32.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
