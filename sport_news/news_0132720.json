I was just thinking about him the whole day. I was just thinking about him the whole day. I didn't know what to do,\" Raap said. \nRaap can't remember life without Wyatt. \n\"He's one of my best friends,\" Raap said. \nThe two met in day care. \n\"He's a really good friend,\" Raap said. \nFriday, not only is the third grade class sporting shirts to honor their friend, but almost every grade, float and fan is becoming a warrior for Wyatt. \n\"It's a small community between us and Salem. We all get together when someone is in need. That's what we do,\" Student Council President Noah Edwards said. \nThis parade is just one of many ways the small community is coming together for Wyatt. They've also raised around $1,700 through a penny war in just a few days. \n\"We all know Wyatt through church and school,\" Edwards said. \nWhile the community is trying to provide strength to the Hanisch family, Wyatt is also proving he's a strong eight year old. Even though he just had radiation Friday morning and isn't feeling well, he still managed to make it to this special occasion. \n\"He's cheerful,\" Raap said. \nAn occasion that shows even those who may be small have a big understanding of life's importance. \n\"I just want to be there for him. I think of him every day,\" Raap said. \n\"Homecoming this year really brought us all together and made us tighter as a school and a community,\" Edwards said. \nIf you want to help the Hanisch family, you can make a donation to help with medical expenses online .
