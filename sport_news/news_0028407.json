(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nThe laundry list known as the Redskins injury report just got a little longer. Redskins coach Jay Gruden said on Monday that safety Trenton Robinson (ankle), running back Chris Thompson (low back contusion), cornerback Bashaud Breeland (knee contusion) and left tackle Ty Nsekhe (plantar fasciitis) were all day-to-day after the 34-20 loss to the New York Jets on Sunday. \nRobinson left MetLife Stadium with a walking boot around his left ankle. He left the game in the second half, playing 49 of the defense’s 67 snaps . Safety Jeron Johnson played the final 18 snaps in Robinson’s absence. \nBreeland also didn’t finish the game, although he had three takeaways before suffering the injury. Quinton Dunbar received his first NFL snaps at cornerback subbing in for Breeland late in the fourth quarter. \nThompson landed awkwardly on his back after leaping for a pass attempt from quarterback Kirk Cousins. He played through the injury, finishing with a team-high six catches for 26 yards and five carries for 12 yards. \nNsekhe didn’t miss a snap at left tackle despite a plantar fasciitis issue in his foot. He received his first career start, filling in for left tackle Trent Williams, who was inactive because of concussion-like symptoms. Along with Williams, Gruden didn’t have any updates on cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver, running back Matt Jones, tight end Jordan Reed or center Kory Lichtensteiger. \nGruden confirmed that while defensive end Stephen Paea was active, he didn’t play because of a back issue. Paea was listed as questionable prior to the game. \nWide receiver DeSean Jackson was ruled out on Saturday with a hamstring injury, missing his fifth straight game. He didn’t travel with the team but arrived on his own. Gruden said Jackson had some family in town and decided to make the trip and receive some extra work on his hamstring before the game, although it remains unclear whether Jackson will play on Sunday against the Bucs after a setback during Thursday’s practice. \n“He’s got a couple good days of rehab here,” Gruden said. “Wednesday we’ll see where he is at. Hopefully it’s coming along.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:43:21.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
