They were both on the practice squad during the 2015 season, and Fowler played in one game with the Bandits last season. Both spent the summer with the Kitchener-Waterloo Kodiaks of the Ontario league, where Bandits GM Steve Dietrich serves the same role.\nDefenseman Adam Will and forward Steve Hinek also will be on the roster. Will was on the Banditsâ€™ Hold Out list last season, while Hinek was a free agent.\nEarlier in the week, Dietrich said that former Bandit Tom Montour has been invited to training camp. Montour last played for Buffalo in 2011, and was a member of the Iroquois Nationals team that finished second in the world indoor championships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:44:45.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
