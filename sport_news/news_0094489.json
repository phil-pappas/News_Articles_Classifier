As per a government report, out of 359 girls who flunked Class VI in 2014-15 in the district, only 13 were allowed to get admission in the same class. The remaining girls succumbed to the parents’ pressure of not pursuing studies. The highest dropout rate is from Uchana block, where 153 girls have not been allowed to pursue studies after failing Class VI. Only five girls have been readmitted in school. In Julana, 84 girls have dropped out and four have got readmitted while, in Pillukhera, the dropout rate is 77 with no girl getting readmitted. In Safidon, 19 girls have not pursued studies after not clearing Class VI and, in Narwana, 13 girls have dropped out while four have been allowed to get readmission. Only Alewa and Jind blocks showned improvement, as the number of girls in Class VI has increased from 789 to 831 and 3,273 to 3,305, respectively, this year. “Since Education Department officers are not serious about checking the dropout rate, parents generally do not prefer to get their girls readmitted in school. The department has never launched a campaign to convince parents to allow their daughters pursue studies,” said Tek Ram Kandela, president of the Kandela Khap that comprises 28 villages of the district. Jind District Education Officer Joginder Hooda could not be contacted. As for Class IX, out of 661 girls who failed this year, 81 got readmitted in the same class. With 228 girls not pursuing studies in Narwana block, it has the highest dropout rate. Only 28 girls have been allowed to get readmission. Jind has a dropout rate of 140, while 19 girls have been allowed to get readmission. Next on the dropout list is Safidon with 73 girls not pursing studies followed by Julana (70), Alewa (65), Uchana (61) and Pillukhera (24). “The BJP is serious about girl education. If there is any laxity on the part of Education Department offices, I will raise the matter with the senior authorities,” claimed OP Pehal, district BJP president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:36:55.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
