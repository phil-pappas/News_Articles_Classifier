Keven Lerner and Dave Hyde Contact Reporters South Florida Sun Sentinel \nThe Miami Dolphins fired head coach Joe Philbin today and will name tight ends coach Dan Campbell as interim coach, a team source told the Sun Sentinel. \nEntering this season, optimism was the highest in four years under Philbin after the team acquired star defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, but the Dolphins got off to a disastrous 1-3 start. Philbin was 24-28 in his three-plus seasons as coach of the Dolphins, who haven’t finished above .500 since he became coach in 2012. \n“This was a tough decision for me to make knowing how tirelessly Joe worked in his four years here to make this a winning team,\" Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement. \"He is a man of the highest character and integrity that I developed a close personal relationship with. I am extremely disappointed with how we have started the season, but I feel confident that we can improve quickly with the talent we have on our roster. We will soon be announcing an interim coach to lead the team going forward.” \nCampbell is in his fifth season as Dolphins’ tight end coach. He originally joined Tony Sparano’s staff as a coaching intern following an 11-year career as an NFL player. \nCampbell, a former Texas A&M standout, played for the New York Giants (1999-2002), Dallas Cowboys (2003-05), Detroit Lions (2006-08) and New Orleans Saints (2009), where he won a Super Bowl.

(Jim Rassol / Sun Sentinel) \nCampbell is widely respected in the NFL for helping tight ends Charles Clay and Dion Sims blossom. Jake Stoneburner, who was recently called up from the practice squad, has scored two touchdowns in three games for the Dolphins. \nLast year, Ross surprisingly announced that he was bringing Philbin back for the 2015 season despite a third consecutive season without a playoff berth. \n“I want to thank Steve Ross for allowing me the privilege to serve as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins,\" Philbin said in a statement released by the Dolphins. \"This is a tremendous organization from top to bottom that has a talented and dedicated staff. I want to especially thank the players, coaches and football staff who have worked so unselfishly and represented the team with dignity and class. I would be remiss if I didn’t thank the incredible fan base who has supported me and my family unconditionally since day one. It is my hope that the 2015 Miami Dolphins achieve great success both on and off the field.” \nList of every Miami Dolphins head coach (1966-2015). \nPhilbin came under fire after four straight lackluster performances to start this season. The Dolphins barely escaped with a win over the Washington Redskins in the opener before losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 2, followed by lopsided AFC East losses to the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets. \nSunday’s game against the Jets was supposed to be a statement game for Philbin to save his job, but the team came out flat once again, sealing his fate. \nThe Dolphins failed to convert any of its 12 third downs, and was 0 for 4 on fourth down. \n“It can seem like the walls are closing in on you,\" Philbin said after Sunday’s loss in London. \nThe Dolphins have a bye this week before returning to the field on Oct. 18 at Tennessee. \nThe Dolphins have been outplayed badly through the first quarter of the season. They have been outscored 37-3 in the first quarter and have trailed at halftime in all four games. They also have been outscored 91-48 during their current three-game losing streak, and rank last in the NFL in rushing defense, allowing 160 yards a game. \nThe Dolphins defense is ranked 30th in the NFL in yards per game allowed (399.5). Only the Raiders and Browns are worse. \nDefensive coordinator Kevin Coyle's unit is tied with Dallas for 18th in the NFL inn points per game allowed (25.2), 24th in yards per play (5.9), and 22nd in third down conversion rate (42 percent are converted by opposing offenses). \nMiami's defense has recorded just one sack in four games, which puts the team dead last in pressures, and opposing quarterbacks have a 95.8 passer rating, which ranks the Dolphins 14th in the league. The Dolphins defense is also allowing a league-high 160.5 rushing yards per game, and no team had been run on more (147 attempts). \nThe Dolphins offense is also struggling, allowing 314.8 total yards (25 th in the NFL) and scoring 16.2 points per game, which ranked Miami 30 th . Only the Jaguars and 49ers are scoring less points this season. \nThe Dolphins are 31 st in rushing yards per game, averaging 69.2. The Dolphins, Jaguars and Seahawks are the only teams in the NFL that haven’t scored a rushing touchdown through four weeks. Only the Lions have had fewer attempts than the Dolphins (65). \nAnd Miami is the second most penalized team in the NFL heading into this week's bye. Only the Eagles have been penalized more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:43:01.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
