(Gary Wiepert | The Associated Press) Comments \nLondon â€” The 2015 Buffalo Bills have been all about possibility. \nReally, that's what this franchise has been all about. They have been selling Western New York on the possibility of a contender for the last 15 years. Never in the franchise's decade-and-a-half long playoff drought have Bills fans bought it like they did with Rex Ryan and the 2015 team, though. \nHe promised to make an already elite defense even better. He took chances on controversial stars, and he guaranteed, over and over again, the Bills would be a playoff team. \nSeven games into Ryan's first season as head coach, the Bills are 3-4 after an embarrassing, 34-31 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Injuries have taken their toll on the Bills' starting lineup, but even when healthy this team has been inconsistent. That's why, instead of pointing to results, the Bills just have excuses, and the conversation is still about what's possible. \n\"Win the rest of them, that's what's possible,\" Ryan said. \"I'll tell you what, when we get this team back to full strength, with having Sammy Watkins, Percy Harvin, Tyrod Taylor, our right side of the line, that would be a heck of a start. Defensively, hopefully you get the Williams back, both of them. I think that will help us.\" \nThe Bills aren't by any means out of the playoff race in a weak AFC. And Ryan is right that the imminent return of a few key pieces should make a big difference. \nStill, while the Bills haven't been mathematically eliminated from contention, it's time to stop wondering about the postseason and start questioning why a team that fashions itself a contender traveled to London and came up short against a Jaguars team that has won nine games in the last three season. Why did a defense that Ryan is willing to bet will finish near the top of the league let second-year quarterback Blake Bortles drive 87 yards on just seven plays for a game-winning touchdown? Why, seven games into the season, have the Bills not eliminated avoidable mistakes? \nEJ Manuel was the easy scapegoat for the Bills' latest lost. He spotted the Jaguars 20 points by having two turnovers returned for touchdowns and a third turnover lead to an easy Jacksonville touchdown on a short field. A questionable late-game pass interference call on Nickell Robey was another easy place to turn when assigning blame Sunday. To point at Manuel or one call from an official is ignoring the fact that the Jaguars gave the Bills every opportunity to win the game, and Buffalo handed it right back. \nBlame whoever or whatever you want, but the Bills are 3-4 heading into the bye week and have to play five of six games on the road starting in Week 9. They play the Patriots on the road and still have to play the Jets twice. Even if they make a run, they could end up looking back at games like the one in London as the reason they extended the playoff drought. \n\"I know our fans deserve better than 3-4,\" Ryan said. \"There's no question. But this team deserves our fan base to stay by them, which they will.\" \nOf course the fans will stick by the Bills. Buffalo fans don't quit, especially not in October. Before they start watching the standings eating up the sales pitch about the run this team is going to go on once healthy, Bills fans might want to take a long look at this team and figure out what exactly they're buying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:22:57.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
