It means I suppose that there would be regulation changes, which have already been anticipated for 2017 so there's nothing new,\" said Ecclestone.\nThe sport switched from V8s to V6 turbo hybrids last year. The alternative is likely to be a 2.2 liter V6 twin turbo similar to those used in the U.S. Indy Car series.\nEcclestone indicated Cosworth would be interested in returning with a less complicated option but others were also in the frame.\nThe 84-year-old said the introduction of a different engine would not turn the championship into a two-tier series and pointed out that decades ago the sport had both turbo engines and normally-aspirated ones.\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Martyn Herman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:25:07.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
