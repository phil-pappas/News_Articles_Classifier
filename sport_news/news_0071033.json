He has more assists versus Columbus (11) than any other NHL team. Johnson is just one of many Jackets trying to reverse a poor start. He has no points and is a minus-four so far.\nFIVE KEYS TO THE GAME\nColum-bust\nMany are wondering if coach Todd Richards survives the month after an 0-4 start that included an awful effort against Buffalo on Wednesday. A multitude of injuries was a valid excuse last season, more than 500 man-games lost, but expectations for a big year can't be sustained much longer and GM Jarmo Kekalainen is one furious Finn right now.\nClarkson comeback\nA week after being acquired by the Jackets last February, Clarkson suffered a season-ending oblique muscle injury. He has yet to play this season because of a lower body issue, but it looks like the winger will make it back in time to play his former team, however it might be fourth-line minutes.\nPrime time Reimer\nThough coach Mike Babcock has already made it clear that James Reimer starts this game and Jonathan Bernier faces the Penguins the next night, this is a chance for Reimer to build on some modest success from last Saturday against the Sens. He was beaten for three power-play goals and one in the shootout by Ottawa, but did keep his team in the game. A Reimer win puts some heat on Bernier, even though the Pittsburgh arsenal is far superior to the Jackets.\nBack to work\nNo one can say the Leafs won't be rested and motivated for this one against a beatable team. During a rare five-day break, Babcock ran a mini training camp. After cutting the Leafs some slack in losing three games in four nights because of unfamiliarity with the system, Babcock says he's going to find out right away in the next few games who is committing to his program.\nDrawing a line\nThe return of Shawn Matthias from a one-game absence with a shoulder injury will mean at least one forward sits. But any perceived letdown by another winger in this encounter will mean they don't play in the Phil Kessel game in Pittsburgh.\nSPECIAL TEAMS\nPower play\nToronto: 20.% (18th)\nColumbus: 29.4% (8th)\nPenalty killing\nToronto: 63.6% (28th)\nColumbus: 64.3% (26th)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:25:54.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
