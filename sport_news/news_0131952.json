(AP) â€” Steve Spurrier says that he made the decision to resign as South Carolina's head coach because the team was heading in the wrong direction. \nHe told a news conference Tuesday: \"We've slipped. It's my fault. I'm the head coach.\" \nSpurrier was in the middle of his 11th season. The Gamecocks were 2-4 overall and 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference for the first time in Spurrier's career. \nHe had never had a losing season in 25 previous seasons coach at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) or South Carolina, where he has been since 2005. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:14:39.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
