Tens of thousands of onlookers rhythmically waved pink and red artificial flowers as throngs of goose-stepping soldiers paraded and Kim, wearing his signature dark Maoist suit, saluted as he overlooked the spectacle.\nMilitary aircraft flew in a formation overhead spelling out the hammer, brush and sickle symbol of North Korea and the number 70. Amid the tanks, drones and armored vehicles in the parade, were what appeared to be North Korea's first intercontinental ballistic missile, the KN-08, carried on a 16-wheeled vehicle, according to media reports.\nWhile North Korea has nuclear weapons, it remains unclear whether its scientists have developed a means of delivering the bombs on long-range missiles. After the show of military might, the 30-something leader delivered 25 minutes of tough-worded remarks reiterating the United States as North Korea's chief adversary.\n“Through the line of Songun (military-first) politics, our Korean People’s Army has become the strongest revolutionary force and our country has become an impenetrable fortress and a global military power,” he said, according to AP.\nStanding beside Kim was a visiting dignitary from the isolated nation's primary ally and trade partner, China. Liu Yunshan, a fifth-ranked member of Chinese Communist Party, arrived with a letter from Chinese President Xi Jinping urging the continuation of close ties between the countries.\nIn this image made from video, North Korean military vehicles parade at the Kim Il Sung Square during the ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the country's ruling party in Pyongyang.

The negotiations would also involve the United States.\nNorth Korea uncharacteristically invited large numbers of foreign media and delegations to Pyongyang for the showy 70th celebration. Satellite imagery during large-scale rehearsals for the parade captured troops marching through a mock-up of the Kim Il Sung Square, according to AP. Large crowds of civilians had also been practicing their roles.\nUSA TODAY\nNorth Korea readies massive anniversary celebration", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44c469efab00595490786b785ee59df7bf133ecc/c=1224-0-6136-4912/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799976462696523-AFP-545192044.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800560254872730-AP-North-Korea-Anniversary.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/10/09/north-korea-anniversary-celebration/73664196/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d7d7763b533cf1fb27df7e55e1bef7279d44d1ab/c=193-0-2808-1966&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800560254872730-AP-North-Korea-Anniversary.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4cdb338825c7a8a58ff7bf72c5865c1029d8e018/r=500x327/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800560254872730-AP-North-Korea-Anniversary.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:09:53.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
