Video clips are widely available on YouTube. Live performances have been put on hold, however.\nThe 6-foot-7-inch UNLV freshman has been sidelined for about 10 days with a sprained left ankle. He did not practice Tuesday, but he did announce he's ready to return.\n\"It's fine. It was just a little sprain,\" he said. \"I honestly feel I'm at 100 percent right now.\"\nJones was hyped as the best dunker in high school basketball last season , and he has contest wins to prove it. Still, he's unlikely to win anything Thursday night in the Runnin' Rebel Madness event at the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center.\nTarkanian Court from the Thomas & Mack Center will be moved for the midnight madness-type event that includes a dunk contest and 3-point shootout. Doors open at 6 p.m., and the action begins at 7. Jones is most likely going to be a spectator.\n\"We'll probably sit him out,\" coach Dave Rice said. \"I wouldn't say he's out, but he's doubtful.\"\nRice said UNLV athletic trainer Dave Tomchek recommended more rest to protect Jones' ankle. Jones is cleared to practice on a limited basis, and he has a chance to go full speed by Friday or Saturday.\n\"That's what everybody is coming out to see is us put on a show,\" said Jones, who called this the first ankle injury of his career. \"I would hope I get to participate and get my dunks off. I'm not used to not being on the court playing with my team.\"\nIt's more of a priority, Rice said, to have Jones on the floor for the Rebels' closed scrimmage at Southern California on Oct. 31 and an exhibition against Whittier on Nov. 6. UNLV opens its season against Cal Poly on Nov. 13.\nRice scheduled draft combine-type workouts for NBA scouting personnel Friday and Saturday at the Mendenhall Center, where at least 25 teams are committed to attend. The Rebels have several players who are considered NBA prospects, including Jones and 7-foot freshman Stephen Zimmerman from Bishop Gorman High School.\n\"I should have no problem (participating) in that. I hope so,\" Jones said. \"That's exactly what I'm looking forward to is NBA scouts coming in and being able to showcase my athleticism and everything. It's going to be a good thing for me and my teammates. We're all going to make it one day.\"\nJones is a high-level athlete, but he also has to prove he's not a one-trick pony with only dunks to show off. He graduated from Archbishop Carroll High School in Radnor, Pa., as the school's all-time scoring leader and was named to the USA Basketball Developmental National Team.\nSome reports on Jones during his prep years were critical of his shooting ability. He said it's an unfair criticism while also admitting he's working on developing a better jump shot.\n\"I recall when I played AAU basketball I hit nine 3s in a game and I had 76 points or something like that,\" Jones said. \"I guess I'm the one that knows the real truth. People say I can't shoot, but if you give me an open shot, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to miss it.\n\"I'm not a pure jump shooter yet. I'm still only 18 years old, so I'm in the gym working hard. I have been getting up a lot of shots after practice.\"\nRice said Jones has a more well-rounded game than advertised.\n\"We think Derrick can be a lock-down defender, even as a freshman, and a good rebounder,\" Rice said. \"He's a much better shooter than people think he is. He's a guy who will make open jump shots. He works very hard and continues to improve.\"\nContact reporter Matt Youmans at myoumans@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2907 .
