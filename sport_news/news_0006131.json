As long as I don't make turnovers, we should be successful. It's really not the turnovers, it's the decisions that I make or other people make. I'm mad at the decisions, not (at) what's happened. I know what I'm capable of and I try to make those plays happen.\" \nOften it's Boyd's legs that are his primary playmaking tool. He considers himself a more gifted runner than passer and enjoys the chance to take off when he sees an opening. \n\"I feel like when I run, I can't be stopped,\" Boyd said. \"I like for them to try to tackle me. I like when I make a move and they miss. That makes me feel like I've done something. I like taking my highlight reel home and watching those plays.\" \nBoyd, who has rushed for 572 rushing yards and four touchdowns, tries to replicate the style of play of Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton – his role model. \n\"(Newton) can run and throw the ball,\" Boyd said. \"I feel like he carries the team on his back, and that's the kind of leader I admire.\" \nBoyd, a verbal basketball commit to Northwestern State, believes his role as a quarterback and point guard have challenged him to be a leader. \n\"As a quarterback and the No. 1 and No. 2 guard in basketball, he's always been in that leadership role, where he's had to do things for the team,\" Suggs said. \nWhen asked how he'd like to be remembered after his football career comes to an end, Boyd expressed hope for his athleticism and potential. \n\"Really, just being unstoppable and just being a leader,\" Boyd said. \"Just being me.\" Southeast Texas sports news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:21:45.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
