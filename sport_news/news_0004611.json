By Brendan CarlThe Daily World \nA potent one-two punch by Aberdeen was all it needed to keep Elma at bay on Thursday. \nTwo quick goals, one each by junior Tayler Housden and senior McKenzie Brooks, were the starting point for the Bobcats, who went on to knock off the Eagles, 4-2, in this Evergreen 2A/1A League girls soccer match at Stewart Field. \n“It is always nice to win on Senior Night,” AHS head coach Larry Kinread said. “We did a nice job with possession in the early going and managed to get a couple in that were nice. Unfortunately, we left some people unmarked and gave them a couple opportunities that we shouldn’t be giving up at this point in the season. Our touch was back and better than it looked in the last few games and we communicated really well.” \nAberdeen (9-1, 10-2) came out quick with three shots from senior Jade Caskey sailing wide in the first three minutes. The Bobcats weren’t able to put the ball in the net until Housden scored in the 26th minute. Housden got the ball around 25 yards out, juked by two defenders and blasted a shot into the right side of the net. \nThe Bobcats struck again two minutes later. Aberdeen’s Alex Wilson’s shot from 12 yards out was stopped by Elma goalie Holli Ray, but the rebound was cleaned up by Brooks. \nThe Eagles got on the scoreboard eight minutes into the second half. Morgan Rockey possessed a corner kick from Alicia Hook and sent a quick pass off to freshman Kassedy Olson, who blasted the ball past the Aberdeen goalkeeper. \nIn the 57th minute, this time it was Wilson who put back a rebound to give the Bobcats a two-goal lead. Elma was quick to answer. Less than two minutes later, Hook sent a cross to freshman Brooke Sutherby who let the ball bounce once and fired it into the net. \nAberdeen’s Mackenzie Arnold capped the scoring for the Bobcats on a shot from about 20 yards out on the right side. The ball took a bounce Ray wasn’t expecting and rolled into the net to make the score 4-2 in the 73rd minute. \n“Aberdeen’s numbers in their attack were a bit tough to deal with,” Elma head coach Scott Rockey said. “They were switching the field and we were having to adapt and pull players from other areas to cover. Our offense did a good job of getting the ball in the middle and playing wide for crosses. I’m impressed with how the girls handled the speed of the game.” \nKinread cited seniors Caskey, Brooks, Kayla Williams, Kendra Larsen and Taylor Bemis for their play on Thursday and throughout the season so far. \nBoth teams hit the road on Tuesday when Aberdeen travels to Eatonville and Elma (4-6, 4-8) travels to Tenino.
