Halloran, at full tilt, stopped on a dime and rocketed a blast for the top right of the North Hunterdon net. Keeper Joe Vitovich got there but never had a chance to deny Halloran’s shot with that kind of power behind and it fizzed off Vitovich’s hands into the net. \nSometimes long-range goals come from kicks that were meant as passes and wind up in the net. Not this time. \n“He meant that one!,” said one Phillipsburg fan. \nHalloran, who had scored the Stateliners' first goal in the first half, certainly did. \n“I knew it was going in as soon as I hit it,” he said. \nIt’s precisely that kind of confidence that the best soccer goal scorers have. It can come off as egotistical, but it’s not; it simply reflects the confidence playmakers such as Halloran have to have to launch a shot from 30-plus yards and know it’s going in. No confidence, no goal. \nSo, Skyland defenders: Halloran wears No. 10. He crosses midfield, best to shut him down. Or watch his confidence, his skills and his aim combine to find the net.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:22:14.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
