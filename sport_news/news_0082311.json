But would it fly in Denver, the heart of the West?\nAlmost immediately, actually. The media and music fans took to the idea right away. So did violinists, cellists and bassoonists who were looking for non-traditional ways to make their music.\nWith its 10th season beginning this weekend, the chamber orchestra has settled itself as a staple on the cultural scene and one of its bright spots, succeeding on its own artistic terms and delivering the goods consistently.\n\"There was a little hole in the local scene, and we were able to slide right into it,\" said co-founder and violinist Cynthia Miller Freivogel , who also leads the ensemble, giving nuanced cues from her seated position rather standing.\nDenver offered high demand and little competition. \"In a place like San Francisco, we we wouldn't have been able to grow and thrive.\"\nThe chamber orchestra has opened up options for consumers, giving them a choice of hearing their Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi played on recorders, wooden flutes and instruments fitted with traditional gut strings instead of the metal ones most contemporary players use.\nThe musical tools alter the sound of Baroque masterpieces, turning it earthier, looser and lush, and in some ways rougher and less refined.\nBut that's what its composers intended when they put note on paper in the 17th and 18th centuries. The orchestra members use a combination of older, refurbished instruments and new ones designed as replicas of the originals.\n\"We actually learn from our instruments what works best with phrasing and how to bring the music alive in interesting ways,\" said co-founder and artistic director Frank Nowell , who plays the harpsichord. \"The instruments are our teachers.\"\nAlthough the players have a way of teaching each other, too. Many of the ensemble members had little experience on period instruments at the beginning, or at making their way through the first-draft scores of the day that allowed classical music to be more improvisational, before \"the 19th century flattened it out and made it a little boring,\" as Freivogel puts it.\nThe Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado rehearses. ( Provided by the Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado ) The journey has made the group tight. About 10 players, who have been with the orchestra for its entire existence, will remain in the lineup this weekend, playing a program that includes Corelli's \"Concerto Grosso.\"\nThe group has faced challenges. The orchestra has never had a stable home, and it has had to cobble together its board and finances like other nonprofits.\nBut it has stayed flexible. Chamber orchestras are smaller than symphony orchestras, and Freivogel and Nowell have programed pieces large and small to keep up with changing cash flow.\nTh orchestra has big plans. It recently collaborated with Wonderbound dance troupe for a performance and hopes to partner with other artists, including vocalists. It would like to commission new work that would complement its vintage sound.\nIt also hopes to grow naturally, the way it always has, by sticking to the basics and valuing authenticity above all else.\n\"We think baroque music has a really wide appeal,\" Nowell said. \"And there are still a lot of people who haven't heard of us.\"\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or @rayrinaldi\nBAROQUE CHAMBER ORCHESTRA OF COLORADO\nThe early music ensemble begins it 10th season with a varied program. 7:30 p.m. tonight and Saturday, Claver Recital Hall, Regis University, 3333 Regis Blvd., and 3 p.m. Sunday , Wellshire Presbyterian Church, 2999 S.
