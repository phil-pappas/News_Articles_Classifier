Even if the Wildcats’ 7-foot senior center– their only returning starter – was going to rest a sore ankle.\nWell before frontcourt addition Mark Tollefsen helped power the Red past the Blue 49-41 with 13 points, eight rebounds and four assists, the Wildcats actually had the biggest news of the day: When projected NBA first-round 2016 forward Lauri Markkanen of Finland gave them a commitment.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats XTRA app: Get latest news, scores\nArizona continued the good times by touring around a number of key recruiting targets, including Markkanen, 2017 five-star forward Jarred Vanderbilt and 2018 five-star forward Marvin Bagley.\nBlue chip big men, all.\nThe recruits, which also included five-star 2017 guard Troy Brown, sat down just in time to catch the pregame videos touting the program’s success and NBA draft picks, while the player introductions charged up the crowd of about 13,000. In turn, Miller grabbed the mic before the scrimmage and noted how those fans can charge up the players.\n“I’ve had a few coaches recently ask if I could borrow some of you,” Miller told the crowd, “and I said no.”\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats picked to win Pac-12 title\nThings were so tilted toward the frontcourt that even the pregame dunk competition wasn’t dominated by some flashy, high flying guard. Instead Tollefsen lived up to his @Air_Tolly23 handle on Twitter by picking up a ball that was descending from a layup, worked it through his legs and then stuffed it back in to win the competition.\n“I’d been doing it since high school but it’s been a while since I did it,” Tollefsen said. “I just thought I’d give it a shot. It was pretty spur of the moment, to be honest.”\nHis splashy dunk earned Tollefsen the dunk title, a mob of congratulatory teammates, and loud cheers.\nThe kind of cheers he hadn’t really heard before while spending three seasons playing for the University of San Francisco.\n“I’ve played in environments like this, but it was always against me,” Tollefsen said. “So it’s nice to have a crowd that’s for me. I thought it was a great experience.”\nAZCENTRAL\nHaller: My preseason Pac-12 basketball predictions\nMaybe it was more so for frontcourt mate Ryan Anderson, who sat out last season following a transfer from Boston College and couldn’t even play in the one public event he was allowed – the 2014 Red Blue Game – because he was still recovering from shoulder surgery.\n“Last year was tough,” Anderson said. “I knew at Red Blue, I was about two months away from being able to be cleared to play. I couldn’t even shoot a ball at this time last year. ... I've been waiting a long time for this.”\nAnderson quickly made up for the lost time. He had 15 points, eight rebounds and two assists to lead the Blue team, and while he played opposite Tollefsen on Saturday, it was clear they could also play together in a front line that could also include Tarczewski or Dusan Ristic, who had 14 points and five rebounds for the Red team.\n“I see so much size,” Tollefsen said. “I can step out to the three, Ry can step out to three and we can attack the glass really well.”\nRistic picked up where he left off at last season’s Red Blue Game, excelling offensively with a chance at virtually unlimited playing time. He had 14 points on 7-for-8 shooting last season and 14 points on 6 of 12 shooting Saturday.\nUSA TODAY\nOutlooks for each team in the preseason top 25\nThe difference this year was that Ristic also picked up five rebounds, can defend better and is much stronger. Miller said Ristic has gained about 39 pounds of muscle on his 7-foot frame; while UA lists him with only 10 pounds more, Miller said that’s because he’s also greatly reduced his body fat.\n“Dusan has emerged and changed his body,” Miller said. “A lot of the experience he got last year was not only in games but also in how he practiced every day. He’s a really an incredibly hard worker. Ryan Anderson and Dusan worked together endlessly this summer on conditioning and in the weight room.”\nOf course there were also guards worth noting Saturday. It’s just that what they did has already been pretty well established: Gabe York and Elliott Pitts each hit a pair of three pointers, Parker Jackson-Cartwright set up the Blue team at the point, while Allonzo Trier barged he way to the basket the same way he did in the McDonalds All-American Game and U19 World Championships, collecting nine points.\nThe intrigue, at least Saturday, was mostly in the frontcourt. While Tollefsen and Anderson were the elder transfers, there were also two freshmen worth noting: Small forward Ray Smith, who showed off his athleticism after missing last season with an ACL tear, and center Chance Comanche.\nComanche had six points on 3-for-4 shooting, two steals and one rebound over 21 minutes but had to contend with Ristic’s post moves on the other end.\n“Chance we really believe in,” Miller said. “You can see his upside.”\nComanche could probably play for just about any Pac-12 team this season but on a team with so many frontcourt options, and so much frontcourt depth, it would not surprise if he redshirted.\nBottom line: Don’t let that one returning starter thing fool you. The Wildcats have options, and depth, especially up front.\n“Mark, Ryan and Kaleb being three seniors, plus Dusan and we have Ray Smith -- that Solomon Hill, that Rondae (Hollis-Jefferson), that Aaron Gordon (type of player) who can bounce back and forth” between the two forward spots, Miller said. “When you look at our depth up front, that’s what I hope is part of our strength.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/add0acf05afebb5b6f829faa3bb8fe86edc10048/c=331-0-2331-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/14/Phoenix/Phoenix/635804415135328726-pac-12-montage.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c47d660a401556d2cda0cdf550493e6d1fa9b13/c=87-0-612-525/local/-/media/2015/08/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635762183712997114-arizonawildcats.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f18f13127bc0b7b9acc9c6216e581f76ac6c1df/c=0-102-2000-1232&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/15/Phoenix/Phoenix/635805058421030391-sean-miller.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3013287bd9e266f5e8948727a583f68a8606b4d5/c=597-0-3021-2424/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805001131739536-USP-NCAA-BASKETBALL-WISCONSIN-AT-MARYLAND-71121696.JPG", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2015/10/15/preseason-top-25-college-basketball-outlooks/73977590/"], "published": "2015-10-18T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:32:52.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
