Amrinder Singh, Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to the Chief Minister, who visited the grain market to check the claims of farmers about the arrival of paddy from Uttar Pradesh, found a truck with Uttar Pradesh paddy in the local grain market. He directed Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Raj Kumar to investigate the arrival and the name of the trader involved in the procurement of paddy from Uttar Pradesh. Later, 11 trucks carrying UP paddy were seized from the grain market. The OSD warned the traders against such kinds of activities to escape action. He also inspected the record of procurement agencies. “Our priority is to procure paddy of Haryana farmers first. The officials not following the Chief Minister’s directions would not be spared. The arrival of paddy from Uttar Pradesh in the grain market is a serious issue,” said OSD Amrinder Singh. The sale of paddy from other states would not be allowed in the Haryana mandis, the OSD added. Amrinder Singh also paid a surprise visit to the Nissing grain market and found a truck with paddy from Uttar Pradesh. He said the brokers, who had been procuring paddy from Uttar Pradesh at a low cost and selling it in Haryana at Rs1,450, would not be tolerated. He directed officials of the Sales Tax Department and the police to probe the matter, besides keeping a strict vigil at all grain markets of Karnal district.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:22:08.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
