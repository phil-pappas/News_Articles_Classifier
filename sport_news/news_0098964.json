Targeting the entire leadership of the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Bharaitya Janata Party, Jakhar demanded a special session of the Vidhan Sabha. He asked Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal to explain to the people why the SAD-BJP combine was “unabashedly hanging on to power” at a time when anarchy was prevailing in the state. He said the law and order situation had collapsed in the state to an extent that the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister and their entire Cabinet had seemingly gone under “house arrest” in Chandigarh. “None of them has been able to muster courage to go and face the people who are squatting in the streets. As the state seethes with anguish over the blasphemous desecration of Guru Granth Sahib, the government is confined to issuing appeals only. Unable to face the growing rage of the people, the government seems to have gone into hiding. Even the Chief Minister, who took pride in maintaining direct connect with the people through sangat darshans, has taken an easy way out, through radio talks. If Amarinder Singh could go and meet the people holding dharnas, why can’t the CM do so?” he said. Punjab had been limping from one “bandh” to another for the past two months and it had come to a virtual standstill for the past five days, Jakhar said. “Due to the failure of the intelligence agencies in the state, some miscreants have been repeatedly hurting religious sentiments of the people. The police and the civil administration have failed to address grievances of the people,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:16:56.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
