(AP) - Triple Crown champion American Pharoah completed a five-furlong workout at Santa Anita in preparation for the Breeders' Cup. \nThe 3-year-old colt was timed in 59.80 seconds Saturday with jockey Martin Garcia aboard. \nTrainer Bob Baffert says American Pharoah was in cruising mode and is on schedule to make the final start of his career in the $5 million Classic at Keeneland on Oct. 31. \nBaffert says he hasn't decided yet whether American Pharoah will ship to Churchill Downs in Louisville or Keeneland in Lexington. He was going to send the colt on Monday, but that has been postponed. \nThe colt worked out Saturday because rain is in the forecast for Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:42:07.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
