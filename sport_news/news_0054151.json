The swimmers of the Aspen youth swim club broke the record for team points last weekend in the season-opening Ned Mechling Memorial swim meet at the Aspen Recreation Center (ARC). The 64 Aspen Speedos started fast on Saturday and finished even faster on Sunday, totaling a whopping 799 points to overwhelm the field of 20 swim teams. The Castle Rock Swim Club finished a distant second with 412.5 points. The Montrose Marlins were third (280.5), followed by Steamboat Springs, Team Sopris and Maverick Aquatics from Grand Junction. “All in all, it was a great way to start the season,” Aspen Speedos head coach Gordon Gerson said. “We scored 39 more points than last year, which was the previous high-water mark.” He said the Speedos were well represented by swimmers from all age groups. “We had a bunch of youngsters at their first meet,” Gerson said. “And we had tons of best times.” A total of 245 youth swimmers participated in the two-day meet in Aspen. Gerson said Shea Card was the high-point swimmer of the meet for the Aspen Speedos with 61 points. “He swam nine events and got eight firsts and a second,” Gerson said of the 12-year-old. “Shea had a really strong meet.” He said the Speedos’ next highest scorer was Davy Brown. “She had 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 firsts, a second and a third,” Gerson said. “Even more amazing, (she had) six best times.” Cole Petersen had an outstanding meet, according to Gerson. Petersen won four events and finished second in five more events. Gerson said Petersen and a Montrose swimmer have developed a rivarly in the 13-14 division. “They are raising the bar,” Gerson said. And they’re setting pool records. Aspen’s Gavin Boggs, a 7-year-old in the 8-and-under category, had three firsts and three seconds last weekend. Sister Lillie Boggs collected three firsts, three seconds and three thirds in the Aspen meet. Aspen’s Mahaila Bouman, 8, finished second in the 25 breast and second in the 50 breast. “She keeps getting better; she’s really into it,” Gerson said. Gracey Brown, 9, had two thirds last weekend. “Lewis Brown got a second in the 50 free, a second in the 200 free and a third in the 100 free and the 500 free,” Gerson said. Kelli Callahan had a couple of firsts for Aspen in the 15-and-over division. “Nathan Cherry was second in the 500 free,” Gerson said. “He’s working hard.” He’s a 13-year-old in the 13-14 division. “Siena (Ettlinger) ... it was her first meet ever. She’s 6,” Gerson said. “She got second in the 25 back and third in the 200 free for the 6-and-under division.” Other top finishers for the Speedos included Emily Kinney, Owen McLernon and Maddie Mechling. “Emily Kinney has been working really hard, and it shows,” Gerson said. She finished third in the 50 breast and third in the 200 freestyle in the 12-and-under division. “Owen McLernon had a lot of nice time drops,” Gerson said. McLernon finished third in the 100 individual medley and third in the 50 fly. “He’s been really focused.” “(Maddie Mechlling) is continuing off her strong performances this summer,” Gerson said. She finished with four firsts and five seconds in the meet named in honor of her late father. Sister Charlie Mechling collected four firsts and five seconds in the 15-and-over category. “She had solid swims,” Gerson said. Young Henry Mellenthin, 6, had a couple of first places in the 6-and-under category — the 25 free and 25 back. “Kennidy (Quist) had a really nice meet,” Gerson said after she broke the pool record in the 50 freestyle in her division. The 16-year-old broke the record previously held by Emily McDonald, who went on to a distinguished college career. “She had four firsts, three seconds and some nice time drops.” Sara Michelin, 7, grabbed two seconds and two thirds for the Speedos. Teammate Everett Olson, who competed only one day, finished second in the 100 IM for boys 13-14. “Micah Sanders-Silva had two firsts and six seconds,” Gerson said. “He’s developed a rivalry with a swimmer from Vail. They pushed each other.” Aspen’s Kayla Tehrani, 11, had four seconds and four thirds in the home meet. Harry Valentine-Wilson won the boys 11-12 200 breast stroke. “He keeps working hard; he’s getting faster,” Gerson said. Seven-year-old Penelope White finished third in the 100 freestyle for her division. Molly McManus of the Speedos won the 100 breast for 9-10 girls. Eddie Zane of the Speedos, 8, won two events and collected a third place in his only four events. Gerson said that Sam Terranova of Steamboat, who competes with the Aspen Speedos, won the 100 back and was second in the 200 back. She’s 18. The Aspen Speedos will head to Montrose for the next swim meet. Then, the Speedos will compete in Glenwood Springs. The Aspen Speedos also will take a December trip to a multistate meet in Las Vegas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:03:45.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
