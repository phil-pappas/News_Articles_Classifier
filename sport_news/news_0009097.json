(Photo: Kamil Krzaczynski, Getty Images)\n1 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The NBA will launch its inaugural Jr. NBA Week — a series of events designed to instill the core values and fundamentals of basketball for kids ages 6-14 — on Monday.\nThe Jr. NBA, which will run through Oct. 26, is a program that exists internationally across 33 countries with a goal of revamping the youth basketball experience. Jr. NBA Week was created to expand those efforts with hopes to reach over five million children in the U.S. and Canada over the next two years.\n\"This is a long-term initiative,\" NBA Vice President of Youth Basketball David Krichavsky said. \"We've just set a goal for the next two years, but this is a program that we see going on well past two years, you know, up to 10 years and beyond.\"\nDuring the week, all 30 NBA teams will combine to host over 100 events involving their top players and coaches.\nUSA TODAY\nFive NBA players facing the most pressure in 2015-16\n\"We definitely understand that what makes this program cool, particularly to kids, is the ability to connect with the NBA, our teams and players,\" Krichavsky said. \"A core part is making them accessible through events as part of this program.\"\nThe events will vary from team to team. Each organization can create its own curriculum. Every experience will be unique, ranging from rebuilding New York City's historic West Fourth Street courts known as \"The Cage\" with the Knicks to an instructional skills clinic with the players and coaches of the Atlanta Hawks.\nIn addition to the hands-on events across the country, the Jr. NBA will also be launching an interactive website on Monday (JrNBA.com), as well as an app on Thursday, with the intention of expanding its reach even further through Internet engagement.\nFOR THE WIN\nDoc Rivers: 'I never said the Warriors were lucky'\n\"We think one of the ways that we're really going to provide resources to the youth basketball community is through the website and the app,\" Krichavsky said.\nThe website emphasizes instruction through different video modules in which kids can receive tips from their favorite players, including Chris Paul on ball handling, Jeff Teague on passing, John Wall on defense and Kenneth Faried on rebounding.\n\"We've focus-grouped the video content with some of our youth basketball partners and have just gotten tremendous feedback from parents,\" Krichavsky said.\nParents noted increased attentiveness from their children while learning from the instructional videos. Kids no longer have to watch a how-to from a middle-schooler dribbling in his driveway, for example, but can instead learn from various NBA superstars.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nFantasy basketball sleepers for the 2015-16 NBA season\nKids aren't the only ones who can benefit from Jr. NBA Week. The Jr. NBA established a partnership with USA Basketball to promote coaching education. The website also provides coaches with codes of conduct, health and safety tips and skills and drills.\nThe Jr. NBA will also organize a leadership council made up of current and former NBA players, coaches and analysts to assist in the advancement of the program.\n1 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/00f7d05f08de186b3624e6fcd026efcf14ba27e6/c=0-12-3416-2581&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635807837188144222-Jr.-NBA-3.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RQTDJ5&text=Stars%2C%20top%20teams%20launch%20inaugural%20Jr.%20NBA%20Week&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6e0d222ce109ec4b9ed69a9343e5651310559867/r=500x388/local/-/media/2015/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635807837188144222-Jr.-NBA-3.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6df8d0a1c3353d8f96bbcc9e3e8d57c1eeda7709/r=300/https/i0.wp.com/usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/usatsi_8861435.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635807837188144222-Jr.-NBA-3.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4562273090001_video-still-for-video-4562253848001.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RQTDJ5&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebc9519ac086054fa5092ba711393606fbfe81d3/r=300/https/i1.wp.com/usatfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/elfrid-payton-orlando-magic_101815-e1445181422260.jpg?fit=440%2C330"], "published": "2015-10-19T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:45:32.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
