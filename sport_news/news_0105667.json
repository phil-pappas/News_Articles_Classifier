The odds, the history of the game prove that. \n“But to be honest with you, we feel pretty good,” Gibbons said. “We felt good (Saturday) when the game, it definitely got away from us, it’s obvious. But even after going down 0-2 to Texas, we were still a confident group. And we’ve got a great team, that’s just a fact. They have a great team over there, I don’t expect them to cave. There’s a lot of baseball to be played. Tomorrow is a big, big game.” \nDeficits don’t seem to have the demoralizing effect on this team that they might have on others. \nMarcus Stroman, a guy who never seems to be down regardless of the deficit or the situation, sees a similar quality in every one of this teammates too. \n“I feel this team is a great team to face (and deal with) adversity because of the camaraderie and the confidence in every single guy in that clubhouse,” he said. “We don’t get down. We might get down in the series, but you could never tell if you walked into our clubhouse. We keep an upbeat, very positive, nature, and we know we’re capable of getting the job done.” \nThe Jays didn’t fare so well in two of the three home games they had in the ALDS, but that has not shaken their belief that home is a huge advantage for them. \n“It helps when the crowd is yelling for us instead of against us, I think,” first baseman Chris Colabello said having a little fun at the media’s expense. “But playing at home for us, even though we lost those first couple at home in the last series, I think it’s a huge advantage. I would arguably say we have one of the best home field advantages in the big leagues.” \nCentre fielder Kevin Pillar, who doesn’t really seem to care where he makes his highlight reel catches, admitted not having to deal with the elements certainly helps a team like the Jays who rely so heavily on the long ball. He certainly noticed the difference at Kauffman Stadium in K.C. \n“Obviously we hit some balls pretty good that didn’t carry,” Pillar said. “It was cold and a bit windy. Here you don’t deal with the wind or the cold. Historically it’s a good hitters park to hit in and more than anything guys are just comfortable here. We have our batting cage, we have our pitching machine, certain things we like to do here. Guys are just comfortable at home. Guys enjoy hitting here as well.” \nThe Jays could use some home field advantage when it comes to their hitting. For the vast majority of the year they have lived on outslugging opponents, but through two games in this ALCS they have scored just three runs, have yet to hit a homer, and have only four doubles to show for their troubles. \nThe key is getting to the Royals starters, something they began to do with Yordano Ventura but failed to sustain the onslaught. \nThe onus on getting to the Royals early is a direct reflection of the arms in that bullpen that await a team that doesn’t. \nBetween them Wade Davis, Ryan Madson, Kelvin Herrera, Luke Hochevar, and Danny Duffy have made things tough on the Jays. \n“They can dominate you, so it’s tough to string together a lot of hits,” Gibbons said of the Royals fireballers coming out of the pen. “So you hope the game is close enough where maybe you scratch one or two across to put you on top, I guess.” \nColabello, who has had some good swings against the vaunted Royals bullpen already this series, knows exactly how good they are, but points out they can be had. \n“We put ourselves in a position (Saturday) night where we had two runners on and a chance to tie the game (against the Royals pen),” he pointed out. “It’s all we can ask for. But nothing surprises me about them. \n“Early in the year we were supposed to lose to them if they got to the sixth inning with a lead,” he said. “ I think we got to the ninth and it was like 11-11 and we scored off like every one of them. We had some good swings off Herrera (Saturday). Had some good swings off Davis.” \nSo yes, the deficit is real, but so too is the belief that it can be overcome. \nTEAM HAS GOINS' BACK \nThe blame Ryan Goins-train for that fly ball he failed to come up with in Game 2 is not welcome in the Blue Jays clubhouse. \nA day after Goins called off and then gave way to Jose Bautista, who had already stopped his progress on a catchable fly ball that wasn’t caught, teammates were quick to stop any of the blame Goins talk or questions. \n“One play is never going to be a defining moment in a game,” first baseman Chris Colabello said. “It’s going to look like it in a lot of people’s eyes and they’re going to be a lot of cameras in front of your face if you happen to be the guy that was in the middle of it, but I know where his heart is. I know where his effort level is every day. The play happened. Whose fault is it? It doesn’t matter. It’s just one play in a baseball game.” \nJays manager John Gibbons was even more direct on the topic particularly after he was told Goins was taking blame for the misplay. \n“I’ll be damned if he should take the blame for that game,” Gibbons said. “We still had a lead and a chance to get out of it. You win as a team and you lose as a team, really. For him to think that, he’s a standup guy, no doubt about it. There’s nobody that cares more. But that would be an injustice on him for the blame to be stuck on him.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:44:38.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
