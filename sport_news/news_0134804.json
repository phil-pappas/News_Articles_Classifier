When asked about it while he was in Winnipeg, Kane talked around it or inferred denying it.\n\"Something I asked for a long time finally came to fruition,\" Kane said in the THN interview. \"Yeah, I asked for a trade every off-season in Winnipeg.\"\nTo be fair, the Jets also obfuscated on the trade-request matter back then.\nIn his story, Campbell writes: \"Truth is, though, Kane was never a good fit in Winnipeg, even in his first season there where he scored 30 goals.... Every unpaid traffic ticket, every rumour about him skipping out on restaurant bills and having his girlfriend with him on the road, every time he posed for pictures with a wad of money attached to his ear, every time he shaved YMCMB into his scalp became a major cause celebre in the league’s smallest market.\"\nWhy was that?\nKane believes racism is relevant to his story, a charge he first leveled more than two years ago in an interview with THN .\n\"There are lots of guys I could point to that everybody knows publicly who have done a lot worse or been accused of doing a lot worse things than I have,\" Kane said in the interview. \"But they don’t look like me. They don’t look like me.\n\"Jealousy is a disease. It really is.\"\nOn the race question, Campbell made a broad, combined reference to both the hockey world and Winnipeg \"where guys like Thomas Steen are heroes, and it’s a cauldron of narrow attitudes that Kane found a little difficult to handle.\"\n\"I just didn’t feel as though (the Jets) had my back at all,\" Kane said. \"It would have been so simple to just squash it and put it to bed. It just became kind of a big deal.\n\"Common sense would dictate that I can afford a bill at a restaurant no matter what it is. There’d be no reason for me to do that. If you just default to your common sense, I think at the end of the day you’ll realize how ridiculous, how silly and how moronic it really sounded.\"\nFor the THN article, the Jets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff declined to comment.\nKane repeated his charge that the team and his teammates \"didn’t have his back.\"\n\"I was playing with a separated shoulder for a year and a half,\" Kane said. \"I had a broken ankle and a broken hand all at the same time. It wasn’t me telling myself I had a torn labrum. It was the team doctor on the Winnipeg Jets telling me, ‘You need surgery, and that’s the only way you’re going to get fixed. You have a broken ankle. You have a broken hand. I’m sacrificing my body playing through pain, doing everything I can to help that team win with the feeling knowing guys don’t have my back. I feel the organization doesn’t have my back, and you feel unappreciated.\"\nThe Free Press obtained a copy of the THN story just before Paul Maurice’s press conference today, but after player interviews were finished for the day.\nThe Jets coach did respond to Kane’s accusations about \"not having his back,\" and being unappreciated.\n\"I’m sorry he felt that way,\" Maurice said. \"I certainly appreciated him. He did play with a lot of injuries. But if you can find me a player I’ve ever coached where I came out and said, ‘Boy this guy’s playing with a broken ankle and I really appreciate it’, I’ve never said that. I’d never talk about a guy’s injury.\n\"We’ve got guys that played with that. And Evander played hurt. He had a torn labrum and played a year on it. That was his choice to have surgery or not. But he played on it.\n\"That’s a lot of pain. He played through an awful lot of pain and we really appreciated it. But I’m not coming out here and giving you a list of injuries of guys that are playing with them, because they’re playing with them.\n\"There’s no sense drawing targets on backs. I’m sorry he felt that way. I certainly appreciated him playing through those injuries.\"\nTHN ’s story also includes much about Kane’s new start in Buffalo and how his outgoing personality will fit there.\n \ntim.campbell@freepress.mb.ca\nRelated Items Photo Galleries Minnesota Wild vs. Winnipeg Jets, Oct. 25, 2015 Articles Buffalo Sabres forward Evander Kane to miss 4-6 weeks with left knee injury Jets Burmistrov fined for elbowing Spurgeon Sunday night Line combinations get approval from Jets Hutchinson unfazed by Wild’s blinding-fast goal  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:52:13.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
