(Photo: Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY)\n2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck did more watching than throwing in the portion of practice that was open to the media Wednesday morning.\nIt was an uncommon sight: Luck customarily takes nearly 100 percent of the snaps with the Colts' first-team offense. Instead, he stood back and watched while backup Matt Hasselbeck worked with the wide receivers. Newly-signed practice squad quarterback Alex Tanney, who joined the Colts just yesterday, also saw reps.\nLuck has never shown up on an injury report in his NFL career. Speculation swirled after Sunday's come-from-behind victory in Tennessee that the Colts' franchise quarterback was playing hurt. In the immediate moments after the game, Luck was admittedly more drained – both mentally and physically – than normal.\nAt Wednesday's press availability Chuck Pagano said Luck hurt his shoulder during Sunday's game. Asked if he thinks Luck will play against the Jaguars, Pagano said he's \"day-to-day.\"\nUSA TODAY\nInjuries: Rex Ryan doesn't seem optimistic about LeSean McCoy, Sammy Watkins\n\"I wouldn't bet against 12 ever. Supreme confidence that he'll play,\" Pagano said.\nOn Monday, Luck was asked if he was playing injured.\n\"Football is a physical game, right, we all know that,\" he said. \"You wake up Monday morning or Sunday night after the game on the plane ride home, you feel bumps and bruises. Some games are less physical than others, and that's sort of the nature of it. This past one certainly was physical. There are a bunch of guys I'm sure in both training rooms recovering from stuff, but for me it's sort of business as usual. Go out there, get over those bumps and bruises, those sort of nicks and get out there and play.\"\nLuck was then asked if he'd show up on this week's injury report.\n\"I don't think so,\" he said.\nThen the Colts curiously added a quarterback to the practice squad on Tuesday.\nThinking longterm, if Luck is dealing with more than just bumps and bruises, the Colts might consider this: The team will play two games in five days beginning this weekend. The Colts host Jacksonville on Sunday, then face a short week and travel to Houston and see reigning Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt for their only Thursday night game of the season. A week after that the New England Patriots come to town.\nIt's not a stretch to say Luck has been running for his life in early parts of this season. He's been sacked five times, hit 10 more and hurried on 38 snaps in three games. The Colts' offensive line – the one the team blew up Sunday, shuffling in three new players in new positions – has been a work in progress, to put it nicely.\nThe Colts yielded 71 hits on Luck last season, 14 more than any team in the league. They allowed 150 quarterback hurries, tied for the fifth-most in the league.\nUSA TODAY\nUSA Today | Sports | NFL\nThe only significant move the team made in the offseason to improve the unit was signing guard Todd Herremans. He lasted two games in the starting lineup before being benched Sunday. The Colts also shifted Jack Mewhort to right tackle to start the year; that lasted only two games, as well, as Mewhort was back at left guard on Sunday in Tennessee.\nLuck struggled for most of Sunday's game, only to haul the Colts on his back with a two-touchdown performance in the fourth quarter that delivered a 35-33 win. He looked spent after the victory, and was asked about it.\n\"You try not to ride the emotional roller coaster, in a sense, but I think after a game like this, you feel spent, and you should,\" Luck said. \"If you're not giving it your all, then I think you're wrong.\"\nZak Keefer writes for the Indianapolis Star\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL Week 3 power rankings: Steelers drop out of top 10 | 02:12 USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes breaks down the latest power rankings.
