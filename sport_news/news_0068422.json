Kenney said he supported Commissioner Charles Ramsey's policy of making the officers' identities public within 72 hours.\nBailey doesn't support \"a full throttle release of names,\" \"I think there's a balance,\" she said, noting she is in favor of body cameras for all officers.\nAnother notable difference came when Bailey, a business executive, said she would vote to revoke Philadelphia's status as a \"sanctuary city,\" a city that restricts local police cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nIn April 2014, the Nutter administration enacted a policy that requires ICE to obtain a judicial warrant, along with a detainer request, for any prisoner in city custody who would otherwise be released.\n\"They think if we get rid of (sanctuary city status) all the sudden we're going to round up al the illegal citizens and deport them,\" Bailey said. \"That's not what Sanctuary City is about. It's for people who are here illegally and committing crimes, that we will hold them until a detainer request is granted and I think that is something that we need to do in order to keep Philadelphians safe.\"\nKenney rejected that view, calling the family detention center in Berks County \"basically a concentration camp,\" and pledging to keep the status if he is elected mayor.\nOn how to combat crime, Kenney says he favors legislation continuously blocked in Harrisburg that would make it a requirement for gun owners to report lost or stolen weapons.\nBailey repeated her call for 500 more police officers on the force. Asked how she'd pay for such a surge she said she'd shift the city to \"paperless operations,\" which she said could save millions.\nBoth Kenney and Bailey said they would keep on school Superintendent Hite when his contract expires in two years.\nKenney said he could help the relationship between teacher unions and the district because he has experience working with both. \"I think they trust me,\" he said. \"I've not bad mouthed them, demeaned them.\"\n\"It's easy to say you have a good relationship with the teacher's union when you know how much money they're putting into your campaign,\" Bailey shot back.\nAlso running independently for mayor are Newspaper publisher Jim Foster, real estate property manager Boris Kindij and Walmart employee Osborn Hart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:12:55.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
