Haven’t seen his fourth-quarter magic in quite a while. This was the Shane Vereen (eight catches for 86 yards, TD) Tom Brady loved throwing to last year with the Patriots. Odell Beckham Jr. (121 yards, TD) was huge in the first half. No sacks, but plenty of pressure on Eli late and running game just so-so. WR Dwayne Harris had two costly dropped passes in the first half but came back strong.\nGrade : A.\nDefense Oy vey. Great work early on RB Carlos Hyde (21-93, TD) but not late. Good Lord, did Colin Kaepernick (23 of 35, 262 yards, two TDs) have time to throw and he probably should have run more (3 carries, 23 yards). Too many lapses and busted assignments down the stretch reminiscent of the first two games. Landon Collins could have sealed the game but couldn’t come with the interception. Two sacks for Damontre Moore chasing down Kaepernick. Loss of Jon Beason early didn’t help.\nGrade : C.\nSpecial teams Harris got some unnoticed yards averaging 10 yards per punt return. Josh Brown hit three field goals (22, 41, 24 yards) and now has hit 17 straight. Brad Wing continues to do the job putting the ball inside the 20. Rookie Geremy Davis got hit with a block in the back penalty on a punt return.\nGrade : B-plus.\nCoaching Getting Vereen involved was smart work by Ben McAdoo. Steve Spagnuolo is losing linebackers at an alarming rate and his defense faded down the stretch. Tom Coughlin knows his club got away with one here, because this would have been a horrific loss.\nGrade : B.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under colin kaepernick ,  eli manning ,  new york giants ,  san francisco 49ers ,  shane vereen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:20:09.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
