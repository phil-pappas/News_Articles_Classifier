Exhausted. But vindicated yet again.\nIt takes a different level of fitness, he'll tell you, to play striker.\nYates, the Minutemen's leading scorer with four goals and two assists, had been one of the top goalkeepers in South Jersey in his sophomore and junior years. Last year, he helped lead the Minutemen to Coaches Tournament and Group 4 state titles.\n \"It's been a big adjustment,\" he said after his goal gave the Minutemen a 1-0 win at Salesianum, a perennially top-ranked team in Delaware. \"But I never doubted that I could do it. It was the only choice I had - either play in the field or spend my senior season moping on the sidelines. For me, there was no way that was going to happen. It was never an option.\"\nHe was set to reprise his role as keeper this season until he tore his right labrum in a collision during a club game in late July, less than a month before the start of high school preseason.\nThe moment presented something of a crossroads. For the ultra-competitive, fiery senior, his entire focus was in one direction: He wanted to play soccer.\nHe was in too much pain and lacked the range of motion to be a goalie. But he could run.\nSo he put off shoulder surgery until after the season and switched to striker.\nNow he's the leading scorer for The Inquirer's top-ranked team in South Jersey.\n\"I'm just happy to be out there in any capacity,\" Yates said. \"And I'm trying to make the most of it.\"\nIn many ways, Yates is the perfect symbol for this year's Minutemen (11-0-1).\nThe team features a host of players successfully transitioning to new roles - none more glaring than Yates.\nEven more obvious is the change in style that Yates is fostering for the Minutemen.\nLast year, Washington Township featured one of the most talented, flashy senior classes South Jersey has ever seen.\n\"Last year was more flair, this year is about grit and toughness,\" coach Shane Snyder said. \"We're balanced all over the field, solid defensively. And we've been grinding every game, and Travis has really stepped up for us as a senior leader.\"\nGrinding is the perfect way to describe Yates' season so far. He isn't the biggest or fastest player. But his toughness during games - verbally, in firing up his teammates, and physically.\n\"My body isn't used to this much running,\" he said. \"As a goalie, you're trained for quick little, short steps and bursts - my abs would be a little bit stronger - but the running, the speed and the overall fitness level is definitely elevated a little bit in the field.\n\"My teammates have helped so much. I've just been trying my best to be in the right place at the right time.\"\nYates' new position wasn't totally foreign; he played striker his whole life until moving to goalie before his sophomore season. The switch was due largely to the logjam of top talent in the Minutemen's offensive third. But Yates was a natural in net and still plans to play the position in college (he is undecided on where he will go).\nFor now, though, he's totally focused on a season that's about to heat up. The Minutemen visit archrival Cherokee on Thursday. They play the opening round of the Coaches Tournament against West Deptford on Saturday. After that, playoffs are in sight.\n\"We're entering the home stretch,\" Yates said. \"We've been playing with great chemistry. The whole team is working hard. To finish this year strong would just mean everything to us.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:32:27.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
