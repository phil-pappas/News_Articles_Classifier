He wanted to expel the Jews,\" Netanyahu told the World Zionist Congress.\n\"And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said: 'If you expel them, they'll all come here.' 'So what should I do with them?' he asked. He said: 'Burn them.'\"\nThe comments were widely criticised, with Palestinian leaders and the Israeli opposition accusing him of distorting history, while historians called them inaccurate.\nOnline mockery also ensued, including one photo mock-up saying it was also the mufti \"who really broke up The Beatles\".\nOn top of that, the controversy erupted just before Netanyahu left for a visit to Germany to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and US Secretary of State John Kerry.\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu said accusations that his comments exonerated Hitler were \"absurd\" but stood by his claim that the Muslim leader who sympathised with the Nazis had an influence.\n\"I had no intention of exonerating Hitler from his diabolical responsibility for the extermination of European Jews,\" he said shortly before he boarded his flight to Germany.\n\"Hitler was responsible for the final solution of the extermination of six million. It was he who took the decision.\"\n\"(But) it is equally absurd to ignore the role played by the mufti... who encouraged Hitler, Ribbentrop, Himmler and others to exterminate European Jewry.\"\nThe current German government was not spared the controversy, nor was Israeli President Reuven Rivlin as he visited the Czech Republic.\nAsked to comment, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said in Berlin that he would not speak directly on the claim.\nBut he added: \"I can speak for the federal government, that we Germans recognise that the murderous racial fanaticism of the Nazis was the historical origin of ... the Shoah.\n\"I see no reason to change our view of history in any way. We know of the inherent German responsibility in these crimes against humanity.\"\nRivlin, whose position as president is mainly ceremonial, criticised the mufti, but said that \"in any case, it is Hitler who caused an endless suffering to our nation.\"\nThe comments came amid three weeks of Palestinian unrest threatening a full-scale uprising.\nThe current wave of protests and repression started in late July when 18-month old toddler Ali Dawabsha was burned to death and three other Palestinians severely injured after their house in the occupied West Bank was set on fire by Israeli settlers.\nThe parents of the toddler, Riham and Saad, and their other son Ahmad later lost their lives after suffering serious injuries in the arson attack.\nPalestinians have been protesting repeated Israeli and illegal Jewish settler attacks on Al-Aqsa mosque and closing the Muslim holy site on a number of occasions to worshippers.\nThe Israeli premier sought to tie his historical reference to current debates over the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, arguing that the mufti had also falsely claimed at the time that Jews were seeking to destroy it.\nNetanyahu has said in recent in weeks that such Palestinian incitement over the Al-Aqsa mosque was helping feed the current unrest. \"It is a sad day in history when the leader of the Israeli government hates his neighbour so much that he is willing to absolve the most notorious war criminal in history, Adolf Hitler, of the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust,\" Palestine Liberation Organisation secretary general Saeb Erekat said in a statement.\nPalestinian president Mahmud Abbas said the comments showed \"how history is distorted and used against us\".\nThe leader of the Israeli opposition, Isaac Herzog, said on his Facebook page that \"even the son of a historian must be precise when it comes to history,\" referring to the premier's late father, Benzion, who specialised in Jewish history.\nThe chief historian at Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and research centre said Netanyahu's comments were inaccurate.\n\"Though he had very extreme anti-Jewish positions, it wasn't the mufti who gave Hitler the idea to exterminate the Jews,\" Dina Porat told AFP.\n\"The idea far predates their meeting in November 1941. In a speech to the Reichstag on January 30, 1939, Hitler evoked 'an extermination of the Jewish race',\" she said.\n*This story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:30:20.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
