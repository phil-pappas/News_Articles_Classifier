She's also something of a costumier.\n\"I've been pushing costumes on my friends for years,\" she said.\nThe Madonna show was no exception. Each of Tate's friends came to the Portland concert dressed in different versions of Madonna's ever-changing public persona.\n\"Not dressing up was not an option,\" she said.\nTate, who gathered her friends in San Jose for a Madonna show a few years back, said having everyone play dress-up for the concerts has its benefits. In San Jose, the gaggle of girlfriends were singled out by a tour member, who led the group straight to the front row, where they sat for the duration of the show. At one point during the concert, Madonna pointed her microphone directly at Tate, who promptly sang along into it.\nMadonna pointed her microphone directly at Jen Tate a few years back while on a tour stop in San Jose. Jen, who got to sing along with Madonna, still keeps this picture of the moment in her phone. Photo courtesy of Jen Tate\n \"That was beyond bucket list,\" she said of the moment. \"That's a bucket that I didn't even know existed.\"\nScroll the gallery for a look at Tate and some of her friends, along with other Madonna fans at the show.\nSuggestions for PDX Street Style?
