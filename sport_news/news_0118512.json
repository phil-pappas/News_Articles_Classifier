Rose was immediately taken to surgery and the Bulls have not announced a timetable for his return yet. But head coach Fred Hoiberg is hopeful that Rose will be able to play in their season opener.\nHoiberg: \"We hope\" Rose will be ready to play opening night.\n— Sean Highkin (@highkin) September 30, 2015 Hoiberg said Opening Night hasn't been ruled out for Rose. No structural damage so once bone is healed, should be good to go.\n— K.C. Johnson (@KCJHoop) September 30, 2015 The Bulls announced Wednesday afternoon Rose's procedure went as expected and he'll be able to resume basketball activities in two weeks. From the Bulls:\n\nDerrick Rose's procedure went as expected today. At this time it is estimated he will be able to resume basketball activities in two weeks. \nThe Bulls guard sustained a left orbital fracture in practice yesterday morning.\n\nThis is promising news for Rose, who has suffered through serious injuries the past few seasons. The only downside is that Rose will miss all of training camp and won't be able to properly digest Hoiberg's new offensive schemes that he put in place for the Bulls this season. Rose will not only have to play catch-up whenever he returns, but will also have to adjust to wearing a mask, something that some players have difficulty playing in.\nWhile this is just the latest setback in Rose's career, the silver lining is that this injury happened before the start of the season so he shouldn't be out for too long. If he is actually able to play in Chicago's season opener, that would be great news for the Bulls as their depth at the point guard position is not ideal. However, whenever Rose returns, he will have to face another uphill battle to prove his doubters wrong. He has done it before in spurts so now he will just have to do it again. Derrick Rose may be able to play in Chicago's season opener.
