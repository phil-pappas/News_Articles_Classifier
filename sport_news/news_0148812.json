I had a great Coney Island breakfast for four bucks. I knew where to go for a garage, or (to eat) a great perch.\n“I spent 10 great years here,” he added. “My family grew up here. I still have a place here. It’s part of your life. But Blash (Jeff Blashill) coaches the Red Wings. I coach the Leafs.”\nThe in-game reaction to Babcock was muted. The Wings did not pay tribute — they may when he returns for a regular-season game when season-ticket holders are sure to be in their seats. There were a few signs, one read “Babcock hates puppies.”\nHe put out a strong Leafs lineup for the second-last exhibition game, a 4-2 loss. Mark Arcobello and James van Riemsdyk each scored for the Leafs, who put forth a much better effort than their last two exhibition showings.\nJames Reimer put in a solid showing in net. Dion Phaneuf had a rough night, especially taking needless penalties.\nThe final chance to show off for the coaching staff and the brass upstairs is Saturday, a return engagement against the Red Wings, at the Air Canada Centre. Jonathan Bernier is expected to get the start. The regular season starts Wednesday.\n“When you don’t know the players and you’re trying to find out what they are, you want to see them play more,” said Babcock. “My best opportunity is to watch them play.”\nBefore the game, Leaf defenceman Morgan Rielly said the team was aware of the heavily weighted Detroit part of the Leaf schedule and how it might sit with the coach. The Leafs will play Detroit on Friday in the Wings’ home opener of the regular season.\n“I’m sure he’s going through a lot of emotions, this is his first time back. Even though this is pre-season, I’m sure he’s happy to be back but also pretty nervous,” said Rielly. “As players, we want to do right by him. He coached here for a long time, he won championships, he won just about everything. We want to play well for him.”\nOver in the Detroit room, the Wings repeated their mantra that it’s all in the past.\n“We’ve gone our separate ways now,” Wings sniper Gustav Nyquist said. “We’re really excited with the new coaching staff. We don’t think about (Babcock) at all.”\nWings forward Justin Abdelkader doesn’t hold any ill will towards Babcock for leaving.\n“He had a great opportunity to sign a big contract in Toronto,” Abdelkader said. “For him, being Canadian, maybe it’s extra special going to Toronto. It’s an opportunity where he can go to an organization that’s rebuilding and staring over. Maybe that intrigued him a bit there, too.\n“He’s been a great coach, we’re excited for him. We wish him the best, but not the five games that we play him.”\nBlashill, Babcock’s one-time assistant, praised his former boss.\n“I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Mike,” said the Wings coach. “Without him, it would have taken me longer. I learned a ton from him.”\nBut mostly, the Red Wings wanted to be done with the Bab-talk.\n“I think it’s time we stop talking about that,” defenceman Niklas Kronwall told an in-game interviewer.\nMore on thestar.com\nBuehrle two innings shy of 200 as Blue Jays beat Rays: Griffin\nToronto FC can almost taste the post-season", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:52:25.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
