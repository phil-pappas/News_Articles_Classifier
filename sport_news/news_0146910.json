They are conscious that both the president and general secretary of FIFA are currently suspended. \n\"We also understand there will be a meeting of the 54 UEFA nations as soon as next week. \n\"The FA committed this summer to supporting Mr Platini in his bid to become the next president of FIFA. At the FA Board meeting last week, we decided that remained our position while inquiries into certain allegations were being investigated. \n\"We now await the results of both the ethics committee inquiry and the investigation of the Swiss Attorney General. We note that Mr Platini has issued a strong statement protesting his innocence.\" \nThe statement added: \"This is an extremely disappointing day for football. We trust the FIFA Ethics Committee will conduct the investigations in an independent, robust and timely manner. As we said last week, there are key questions that have arisen in the past month that must be answered by those concerned. \n\"This important process - along with the investigation by the Swiss Attorney General - should not be allowed to affect the need for urgent change at FIFA. Our over-riding concern has always been for full and transparent reform as soon as possible and this remains the FA's priority.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:09.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
