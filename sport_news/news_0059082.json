Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports) 32 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nReno Gazette-Journal sports columnist Chris Murray breaks down Nevada’s game against UNLV with a position-by-position analysis. \nUNLV (1-3) at Nevada (2-2) \nWhen: 4 p.m., Saturday \nWhere: Mackay Stadium (capacity, 30,000) \nTV/Radio: None/94.5 FM \nLine: Nevada favored by 7; total is 57.5 \nLast week: Nevada beat Buffalo; UNLV beat Idaho State Murray's Sunday List: Top 10 moments in Nevada-UNLV rivalry \nPosition-by-position \nQuarterback: You could go either way here. Nevada’s Tyler Stewart doesn’t have big numbers, but his receivers haven’t helped him and he avoids mistakes. UNLV’s Blake Decker is better with his feet, but he’s hitting only 52.8 percent of his passes this year and has 21 picks the last two years. Edge: Nevada \nRunning backs: Both teams are strong here. Nevada’s Don Jackson (381 yards, 5.4 ypc, six TDs) and James Butler (382 yards, 6.8 ypc) have been excellent. UNLV uses multiple backs, too, led by Keith Whitely (265 yards, 4.6 ypc) and Xzaviar Campbell (214 yards, 8.9 ypc, three TDs). Edge: Nevada \nWide receivers/tight end: Nevada is basically a two-man receiver group at this point. Las Vegas native Hasaan Henderson needs to have a big game against his hometown team. UNLV’s Devonte Boyd is among the MW’s best receivers. The big-play machine is averaging 20 yards per catch. Edge: UNLV \nOffensive line: UNLV has a younger line, led by C Will Kreitler, a potential All-MW pick. The Rebels are averaging 5.3 yards per carry and have allowed only seven sacks. Despite the youth, this group has been good. Nevada’s line is similar in its youth and productivity this season. A close one here. Edge: UNLV \nDefensive line: Nevada’s unit loses some talent, power, aggressiveness and toughness with DT Rykeem Yates suspended, but this is still an above-average line. For UNLV, DT Mike Hughes Jr. is a good player who has to control Nevada’s interior line. Both teams have struggled to defend the run. Edge: Nevada \nLinebackers: UNLV’s OLBs Tau Lotulelei (100 tackles, 10.5 TFL in 2014) and Mark Finau, a hybrid end/backer, are good. The group is light, so vulnerable in the run game. Nevada’s Matt Lyons is coming off a career-best 16-tackle game; MLB Jordan Dobrich (muscle strain) should be back. Edge: UNLV \nSecondary: With three senior starters and one junior, this is a strength for UNLV. SS Peni Vea, who has 278 career tackles, is excellent. UNLV’s secondary has seven interceptions this season. Nevada starts two freshmen at safety, but both have played well. Its cornerbacks must step up vs. Boyd. Edge: UNLV \nSpecial teams: Both teams have good kickers: Nevada’s Brent Zuzo and UNLV’s Nicolai Bornand. UNLV punter Logan Yunker (42 ypp) began his career as a walk-on at Nevada. The Wolf Pack has been better in kick return, kick coverage, punt return and punt coverage this season. Clear edge here. Edge: Nevada \nCoaching: This one is too early to grade. UNLV’s Tony Sanchez had huge success in high school and hired a good staff despite budget limitations. He has a big task ahead in turning UNLV into a winner. Brian Polian needs this win. You can’t be 0-2 at home vs. UNLV and keep the fan base happy. Edge: Nevada \nPrediction \nNevada 28, UNLV 24: This game opened with UNLV as a double-digit underdog, but that was far too high (and has been bet down). This game will be close until the fourth quarter. Neither team has overwhelming talent and both teams have plenty of motivation unlike last season when UNLV had a lame-duck coach and was blown out in the second half of a 49-27 Nevada win in Las Vegas. This game will be won in the trenches as both teams want to run the ball and need to run the ball to have offensive success. Whichever team gets its ground game going and holds up against the run will win. Only 10 of the 40 games between these teams have been decided by a touchdown or less, so we usually see blowouts. That won’t happen Saturday. This will be an instant classic.
