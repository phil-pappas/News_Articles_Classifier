By BRITTINI RAY A chorus of boos filled the Tybee Island Police department when event organizers announced to a packed room of concerned citizens that four of six scheduled candidates would not be attending the Tybee Island City Council Forum on Monday night.\nThe event, which was co-sponsored by Forever Tybee and the Savannah Morning News, was scheduled to feature candidates running for the three of the six city council seats up for election. Forum speakers were supposed to include incumbent council members Barry Brown, Wanda Doyle and Paul Wolff and challengers John Bremer Sr., Stephen Friedman and Julie Livingston. Livingston and Wolff were the only candidates to participate.\nShirley Wright, organizer of the event, said all six candidates initially responded within 24 hours that they would participate in the forum, but later expressed concerns of “fairness.”\n“There was a lot of concern of fairness at the forum and whether they would be treated fairly and whether they would get their questions answered,” Wright said. “So we went through great lengths in the question process to make sure that all of the questions would be answered.”\nQuestions submitted for specific candidates, however, went unanswered, which did not sit well with the forum audience.\n“We showed up and we want our questions answered,” an audience member said to moderator Tom Barton, the Morning News editorial page editor. “We want to know their answers.”\nWolff and Livingston kicked off the night answering questions about hot button issues, including the reduction of traffic on U.S. 80, trash management, a ban on alcohol and a community pool referendum.\nAlso discussed was the idea of term limits, allowing dogs on the beach, and a short-term rental ordinance.\nBoth Livingston and Wolff said they would support installing a community pool if residents expressed a desire for it.\nBoth candidates also said they would not support imposing a ban on alcohol.\nTo address traffic congestion and parking issues on the island, Livingston suggested a technological approach which included installing intelligent transportation systems before drivers cross Bull River Bridge, which she said was an inexpensive solution.\n“These systems can show real time data on the number of spaces,the number of people,” she said. “ I think the people that come are going to turn around if they see wow there’s only six spaces left on Tybee and there’s 47 people in front. I think that could help reduce congestion all around.”\nWolf said he was open to suggestions for increasing available parking and suggestions on increasing public safety, in response to an audience question on public intoxication and alcohol-related accidents. He welcomed the idea of increasing DUI checkpoints and citizen participation.\n“About 75 percent of the fatal accidents on (U.S. 80) are alcohol related,” he said. “This is a serious issue. We do have laws on the books and enforcement is key. You guys are part of the solution. If you see someone driving erratically, call the police.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14804916.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14804916.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:08:54.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
