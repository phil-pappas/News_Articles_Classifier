But plant manager Scott Combis said there is one category of waste that can both injure workers and shut down operations whenever it is seen — \"sharps,\" or medical items that include syringes, hypodermic needles and injectors.\n\"The goal (of sorting) is to pull out anything that's hazardous, and we do find quite a few sharps,\" Combis said. \"If we see a needle anywhere in the system, any one of the sorters is trained to stop the line.\n\"They are then supposed to get a trained blood-borne pathogen responder — those are folks that are generally in front-line leadership positions or maintenance (who) have been trained to appreciate the hazards and know how to use special tools and disinfecting spray.\"\nTo avoid both the potential for injury to workers and the down-time involved in operations, a state law went into effect this summer prohibiting the mixing of household generated sharps with any other material intended for collection as recyclables.\nOn Thursday, Combis highlighted the need for such regulations while conducting a tour of the facility and its procedures for officials that included Jerry Peck from the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, Illinois Fire Chiefs Association executive director Tim Sashko, and State Sen. Melinda Bush, D-Grayslake, who co-sponsored the measure with legislators that included State Rep. Linda Holmes, D-Aurora, and State Rep. Rita Mayfield, D-Waukegan.\nAt one point, after seeing things like a lawn mower battery that had been plucked out of the stream, Combis opened a storage area marked with biohazard warnings to show a bin nearly filled with unsealed plastic jugs containing medical waste.\nOnce a bin is filled, arrangements are made with a medical disposal firm to have it taken away for proper disposal. Lisa Disbrow, a public-affairs specialist for Waste Management of Illinois, told the group that residents looking to put sharps in the trash can do so by placing them in a rigid plastic container like an empty laundry-detergent bottle, sealing it with duct tape and writing the words \"do not recycle\" on the outside.\nMedical sharps — which also include items like lancets and needles attached to tubing — can also be disposed of through private mail-back programs or medical-waste facilities. Officials note that sharps are not accepted items at hazardous-waste collection events like those conducted by the Solid Waste Agency of Lake County (SWALCO).\nSWALCO executive director Walter Willis said his agency is looking to spread the word about the new law banning the casual disposal of sharps.\n\"They've had a steady situation here where it's been an issue,\" said Willis as he prepared to tour the processing plant. \"They've had a couple of people who've been stuck, and really this is not just an opportunity to educate the public on the sharps issue, but also the contamination issue.\"\nCombis said the random delays caused by a needle in the system contribute to a daily reality at the 60,000-square-foot plant where rotating discs that separate paper from other incoming items need to be turned off every four hours to weed out things like videocassette tape and, more than anything else, plastic bags.\n\"(Workers) climb in with special cleaning tools, and they spend 30 minutes every four hours just cutting away this stuff that's wrapped inside,\" he said. \"Three hours a day are spent just cutting away the stuff that's built up, because if you have the wrapping, then nothing falls through the holes that need to be there, and the system doesn't work properly.\"\nFor an updated list of items that can be recycled and how to properly dispose of them, officials directed residents to www.swalco.org .\ndanmoran@tribpub.com\nTwitter @NewsSunDanMoran\nCopyright © 2015, Lake County News-Sun Grayslake Rita Mayfield Linda Holmes", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616fc2f/turbine/ct-lns-safe-needle-disposal-st-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:02:33.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
