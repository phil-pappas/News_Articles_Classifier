Only one Met has done significant damage against Clayton Kershaw during the three-time Cy Young winner's two starts in the NL division series.\nDaniel Murphy homered against the Dodgers' lefty ace in Game 1 in Los Angeles, and he did so again in the fourth inning to account for the lone Mets' run in a 3-1 loss Tuesday night in Game 4 at Citi Field. Murphy only belted one homer in 134 plate appearances against left-handed pitching during the regular season.\n\"He didn't make a lot of mistakes tonight, and unfortunately we didn't have a whole lot of traffic out there on him,\" Murphy said of Kershaw, who tossed seven innings of one-run ball on three-days' rest. \"I felt like we had a couple more baserunners the last time we faced him, but he threw the ball well tonight, there's no doubt about that.\n\"He was pounding the zone. Clayton always pounds the zone. There wasn't a ton of mistakes, I didn't feel like. ..You always think there's a chance. We weren't going to stop playing, but again, we didn't give ourselves a ton of chances tonight.\"\nMurphy, in fact, ended up with the Mets' only official at-bat with a runner in scoring position in the entire game, with runners on first and second against Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen with two outs in the eighth. But Murphy flied out to Yasiel Puig in shallow right on a 3-2 cutter to strand the potential tying runs.\n\"The biggest chance, I got against Kenley, and unfortunately, I couldn't finish the at-bat off,\" Murphy said. \"Cutter, out over the plate, and I just missed it. I wish I wouldn't have.\"\nInstead, the Mets now must face Cy Young award candidate Zack Greinke in Game 5 on Thursday in Los Angeles. The NL ERA leader will be working on normal rest after tossing seven innings of two-run ball in Game 2.\n\"Don't miss mistakes, kind of like tonight,\" Murphy said when asked for the key when facing Greinke. \"Try not to miss the mistakes you get. That's probably the easiest way I can describe it.\"\nRelated Stories Dodgers beat Mets in Game 4 behind Kershaw, force a Game 5 Mets’ Bartolo Colon makes another NLDS appearance", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:32:30.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
