Prosise and the Notre Dame defense. \n\"We're excited about the victory against a very good Navy football team,\" said Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly. \"They challenge you for four quarters, their scheme, their players, their coaches, they make you work for everything. It's a difficult team to play.\" \nProsise finished the game with 129 yards rushing and three touchdowns. The Notre Dame senior added 56 receiving yards. \n“I don’t ever want only one guy to tackle me,\" said Prosise, Notre Dame senior RB. \"I hate it when just one guy tackles me. I always want to make it to three or four guys trying to make the tackle.” \nThe Fighting Irish surrendered 21 points in the first half to Navy, but only allowed the Midshipmen to score three points on a field goal in the second half.“I think that every game we are trying to improve on something different and trying to put a complete defense together,\" said Notre Dame defensive lineman Isaac Rochelle. \"We are trying to piece everything together to form a complete defense.” \nNotre Dame will play #17 USC next Saturday in South Bend. \nWSJV-TV FOX 2858096 County Road 7, SouthElkhart, IN 46517", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:04:35.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
