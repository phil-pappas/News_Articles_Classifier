Patrick Maks Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Dolphins trying to stave off lull against Texans \nIn the immediate aftermath of a stirring 38-10 win over Tennessee on Sunday, Dolphins interim coach Dan Campbell finished his victory speech with a simple message. \n\"The sleeping giant,\" he said, \"is awake.\" \nOn Monday, Campbell spoke of staving off slumber — or what he called \"naps\"— as Miami (2-3) prepares for its upcoming game against the Houston Texans this weekend. \n\"The challenge is now for these guys not to start patting themselves on the back because we've been notorious for that around here,\" he said. \"We get a big win, and all of the sudden it's a lull the next week.\" \nThere is, however, a certain sense of optimism that abounds in Davie following what was something of a breakthrough victory for a franchise mired mediocrity recently. \nThe Dolphins — who entered the season with playoff aspirations — played with toughness and pluck against the Titans to end a three-game losing streak. Dan Campbell on players stepping up \nMiami Dolphins interim head coach Dan Campbell on which players stepped up to the challenge. \nMiami Dolphins interim head coach Dan Campbell on which players stepped up to the challenge. See more videos \nAnd because of this, they say there's still time to turn around a season gone awry. \n\"We were able to hope again,\" Campbell said, \"and after that win, now you can start to believe.\" \nIn routing Tennessee, Miami looked like the team some expected it to be following a series of offseason moves aimed at snapping a lengthy postseason drought dating back to 2008. \nOn offense, the Dolphins ran the ball for a season-high 180 yards. The defense — which had allowed 68 points combined in dispiriting losses to the Jets and Bills — put on a ferocious display and rattled Titans rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota. Dave and Omar recap Dolphins win over Titans \nDolphins win 38-10 in first game under new interim head coach Dan Campbell.

Dolphins improve their record to 2-3 and play the Texans next week at Sun Life Stadium. See more videos \nThe Dolphins' stars made a difference, too. Defensive end Cameron Wake had four sacks, strong safety Reshad Jones had a 30-yard interception return for a touchdown, and tackle Branden Albert anchored an offensive line that had its way with their counterparts. \n\"The energy and the speed with which we played is what I was hoping we would get. I knew if we did that, we would be all right,\" Campbell said. \"And I could feel that, the players could feel that … you could feel it. There was a transfer of energy without touching anybody.\" \nFor Campbell, who was named interim coach Oct. 5, this is part of a plan to play a tougher, feistier brand of football following the ousting of former coach Joe Philbin and defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle. \nCampbell started by changing the team's locker-room seating arrangements. He did away with the suit-and-tie dress code for road trips. He has dialed up the intensity in practice with one-on-one drills. \n\"You have nowhere to run, nowhere to hide,\" Campbell said. \"Everybody's watching.\" \nMany will be eyeing where the Dolphins go from here. \nWhile a win over the Titans has raised spirits, this new beginning is being approached with caution. In 2014, Miami lost five of its final eight games following a three-game winning streak that inspired similar good vibes. \n\"It's definitely encouraging, but you want to move forward,\" defensive tackle Earl Mitchell said. \"You're anticipating the next game that's coming up. There's a lot of guys that feel energized — especially with that win — but at the same time, you've got to move on.\" \nUnder Campbell's direction, though, the Dolphins said they are re-energized. \n\"I don't think there's going to be a lull this time,\" Albert said. \"I think guys believe now.\" \nHe added, \"I think guys were like, we do have a good team, and I believe guys know that we can get it done.\" \nWhether or not that sentiment can will help them going forward remains to be seen. \nRoster move \nThe Dolphins signed tight end Brandon Williams off of their practice squad and waived safety Jonathan Dowling on Monday. In three years (2013-15) with the Panthers, Williams appeared in 23 games and caught four passes for 44 yards. \nDowling was signed to the Dolphins active roster on Oct. 14 after originally joining Miami's practice squad on Sept. 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:02:21.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
