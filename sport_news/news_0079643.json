SUBSCRIBE Yahoo Small Business Turns Over Local Listings Management To Yext NY company continues to expand reach as local presence management network. Greg Sterling on October 10, 2015 at 7:49 am \nFollowing in the footsteps of MapQuest last year, Yahoo Small Business is outsourcing local listings management to Yext . Late last week Yahoo notified customers of the impending change in email: \nYahoo is thrilled to announce that we have partnered with Yext to manage your Local Basic Listing moving forward. Some of the benefits you can expect to see from this partnership include more options to publish your listing across multiple publisher sites and an updated dashboard to manage your listing. \nYou do not need to do anything at this time. Yext will be making a new dashboard available for you in November and they will notify you by email when your dashboard is available. In order to seamlessly complete the transition of your Local Basic Listing, once your dashboard is ready, you will need to verify your business information and create a new account and password with Yext. If you do not set up your new Yext account within 30 days of notification from Yext, your listing may be changed to an unclaimed status. You can always return at a later date to claim your listing again. \nIf you have an existing edit to your Local Basic Listing that has not yet been approved by Yahoo, it will be reviewed by Yext and submitted to Yahoo if approved. \nIf you would like to upgrade to a Yext PowerListings Package and have the ability to immediately begin managing your data on over 50 sites including Yahoo, sign up here: http://www.yext.com/pl/yahoo-claims/index.html. \nYext will enable local marketers to manage their listings for free on Yahoo or to upgrade to Yext’s PowerListings data syndication product, as indicated, across a partner network of sites, which include Bing, Yelp, Facebook, Foursquare and others. There are some other Yahoo-only options as well. \nYahoo Small Business is being bundled into the spin-off that includes Yahoo’s remaining shares in Alibaba. The new entity is called Aabaco Holdings Inc . About The Author Greg Sterling Greg Sterling is a Contributing Editor at Search Engine Land.
