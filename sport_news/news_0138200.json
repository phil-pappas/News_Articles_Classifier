The club’s squad and leadership is appropriately cosmopolitan. There are Frenchmen, of course, along with players from Argentina, Iceland, Mali, Morocco, Senegal, Venezuela and elsewhere. The current chairman is Polish, the manager is Armenian and its first scorer this season was a Kosovar defender who spent his childhood in Switzerland and plays internationally for Albania.\nBut it’s the American who takes the lead inside a victorious Nantes locker room.\nIt started in the fall of 2013, when Alejandro Bedoya notched a late game-winning goal against AC Ajaccio and its Mexican goalkeeper, Guillermo Ochoa. Bedoya had just returned from U.S. national team duty in Panama, where the Americans scored late and saved El Tri’s World Cup skin. When told it was his duty to lead the postgame victory cheer in Ajaccio, Bedoya went with the first thing that came to mind: “I. I believe. I believe that. I believe that we. I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win!”\n• CREDITOR: Watch Bedoya lead ‘I believe’ chant at Nantes\nBorn at U.S. Naval Academy football games in the late 1990s, the “I believe” chant had become American soccer’s soundtrack by the time Bedoya arrived in France in mid-2013. And it soon was beloved at the Stade de la Beaujoire, where supporters belted it out, along with Bedoya’s name, following a season-ending loss. A little more than a year later, it’s a staple, home or away, whenever Nantes earns three points. The latest rendition came last week at Lille, where he helped set up the only goal in a 1–0 victory. And it surely will be heard Saturday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, where Bedoya and the U.S. will face Mexico for the right to represent CONCACAF at the 2017 Confederations Cup.\n“Every time [Nantes] win a game, we do it in the locker room,” Bedoya, 28, told SI.com. “It’s either me leading the chant, or sometimes somebody else gets involved. But they always seem to mess it up because of their accents!”\nPlanet Futbol In ever-changing USA landscape, USMNT vs. Mexico a complex rivalry by Grant Wahl", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/BrianStraus"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:33:04.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
