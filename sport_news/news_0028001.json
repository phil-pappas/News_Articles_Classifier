We have to find a solution and only by working hard and talking together can we find a way out of this situation,\" he said.\n\"The players we have brought in during the transfer window are important, some have come from foreign leagues and some are still young. They need time.\"\nFor many observers, however, Milan's problems are more deep-rooted.\nOver the last few seasons, Milan's leadership has often appeared rudderless, pledging faith in youth players while simultaneously signing players in the middle or latter stages of their careers.\nThe fans appear to have realised this and have tended to vent their wrath on long-serving chief executive Adriano Galliani rather than whoever is occupying the coach's seat.\nForward Keisuke Honda offered a more in-depth analysis than his coach after the Napoli game.\n\"Milan have used countless players over the past few years...There are a lot of players who play international football, and they still can't perform when they join Milan,\" the Japan international told reporters.\n\"Looking at the past few years, I think it is clear this club cannot start over unless a lot of money is spent; you either do that, or you have to re-examine the structure of the club. Management, coach and fans must be aware of the situation.\"\n\"In order to change the club, we must change how everyone evaluates it, whether it be directors, coach, fans or media. If that doesn't happen, then five to 10 years are needed.\"\n\"I know I will be criticised because of my thoughts, but they are important for the future of this club. Milan's problems are clear, as they are always the same.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:56:05.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
