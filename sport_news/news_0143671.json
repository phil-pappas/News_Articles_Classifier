Today the 79-year-old says he has done nothing wrong and is appealing the decision. UEFA President Michael Platini, who was also banned 90 days, is expected to appeal too. \nFIFA have also announced that they will hold an extraordinary Executive Committee meeting on October the 20th, in order to discuss the latest developments. FIFA's headquarters is undergoing a major overhaul, but it is the restructuring behind the scenes that is catching the world's attention. \nThe Ethics Committee's decision to suspend Sepp Blatter over corruption claims had led many to wonder if his more than 40-year FIFA career is over. \nThat discussion now looks premature after it was confirmed Blatter would appeal the suspension. He's confident the Appeal Committee will find him not guilty. \nAnd some Swiss journalists also believe Blatter's appeal has a good chance of success. \n\"It is now Larry Mussenden from the Bermuda Football Association who will now decide. We don't know when, maybe in the next days, maybe in the next weeks. What I heard is that it is not impossible he will decide against Dr. Eckhert the German judge in the way the suspension is going on,\" said Dominik Balmer, Journalist.FIFA have confirmed they will hold an emergency Executive Committee meeting on October the 20th. It comes after a number of football associations expressed concern over the latest developments at football's governing body.One of the key topics of discussion is likely to focus on the possibility of postponing February's Presidential elections. Following the bans to Michael Platini and Chung Mong-Joon, Prince Ali of Jordan is currently the only candidate not suspended. And if the elections are delayed, it will once again underline the extent of the crisis within FIFA.Sepp Blatter left his office at FIFA via the backdoor on Thursday. It is still uncertain when -- or if -- he will return.
