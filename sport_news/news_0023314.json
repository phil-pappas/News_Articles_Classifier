The injury isn't believed to be serious or potentially keep him out Sunday against Washington.\nRookie defensive end Leonard Williams says he is fully healed from a minor ankle sprain suffered against Miami in London. He fully participated in practice, as did safety Calvin Pryor, who bruised a knee against the Dolphins.\nAmong those who didn't practice: linebacker David Harris (quadriceps), guard Willie Colon (knee) and running back Bilal Powell (quad). Cornerback Marcus Williams tweaked a hamstring during practice.\n___\nAP NFL websites: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:29:11.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
