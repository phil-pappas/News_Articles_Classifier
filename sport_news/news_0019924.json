Riding the hot hand of a seven-point loss to Pitt, the 1-4 Virginia Cavaliers have been installed as an eight-point favorite to beat Syracuse on Saturday.\nYou heard right. Cavs by a TD and, yeah, let's just go ahead and go there, a snazzy two-point conversion. Considering Virginia has beaten just four power five conference opponents by eight points or more in the last six years, this might be the most ill-advised Vegas leap since Evel Knievel was scraped off the pavement at Caesar's Palace.\nOr maybe the smart money set is on to something. If not now, when? If Virginia can't beat a Syracuse team with a puffed-up resume, who can it beat?\nThe Orange (3-2, 1-0 ACC) are coming off a 45-24 smackdown at South Florida last week that - in keeping with the Jim Boeheim school of scheduling - was their first trip out of Onondaga County this year.\n'Cuse owns wins over Colonial Athletic Association laggard Rhode Island (two losses to Ivy League schools), ACC Atlantic Division rival Wake Forest (owner of the nation's No. 117 scoring offense), and Central Michigan (in overtime, despite giving up 520 yards of offense).\nThe Orange did play inspired ball in a loss to LSU. But Virginia, or at least Cavalier fans, would have gladly swapped non-conference schedules and taken their chances. The U.Va. players, as ever, insist they are a couple plays away, but that's the proverbial check that's always in the mail but never arrives.\nNearing the season's halfway point, Virginia continues to make first-week-of-training-camp mistakes. At Monday's press conference, coach Mike London referenced \"veteran players making critical errors, as far as judgment is concerned\" when asked about breakdowns in the secondary.\nIn response to a question about persistent confusion that has resulted in nine offensive timeouts and three delay-of-game penalties this year, he said that many players \"break the huddle and go to the wrong side of the alignment.\n\"You have to call timeouts and get them in the correct look.\"\nThat's not a good look, and it comes back to preparation and coaching. Now in his sixth and - barring a 180-degree pivot - quite likely final year, London has been judged and found wanting in those departments repeatedly. But if game management and running a tight operation are not his strengths, he continues to show an impressive talent for creating belief in the face of mountains of evidence that little is warranted.\nLondon continues to lose games, but does not appear to have lost the team. Along with an athletic department culture that holds that midseason firings are gauche, and not the Virginia way of doing things, it keeps him around.\nBy all appearances an honorable guy who appears to have his players' overall best interests at heart, London has banked far more goodwill than, say, Maryland's Randy Edsall had before being fired this week. But fans are growing tired of hearing that. In a statement that will no doubt make some of those calling for his coaching scalp cringe, he said Monday that he was \"so proud of this football team.\"\n\"I'm proud of the resolve, the resilience, the no-quit attitude,\" he said.\nWhen I asked him later if he was worried about that resolve lagging, he suggested we ask the players.\nDefensive end Trent Corney said players are from panicked.\n\"I remember years in the past, when we lost a few games in a row, guys in the locker room were extremely shell-shocked, rattled, emotional,\" he said.\nReceiver Doni Dowling, echoing a frequently-voiced sentiment, said he wants to win for London. Center Jackson Matteo struck an almost defiant tone.\n\"No level of urgency. We don't need to rush things. We don't need to change anything,\" Matteo said. \"Everyone in that locker room is doing everything they can to make sure that this team is successful.\n\"We're not going to change anything. We're this close, and we're going to stick to our game plan, we're going to do what we've been doing and we're going to be successful.\"\nThis week, anyway, Vegas believes you can bet on that.\nEd Miller, 757-446-2372 ed.miller@pilotonline.com\nPosted to : College Football Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:27:45.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
