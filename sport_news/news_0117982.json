She had aspirations of going to play overseas, but she was always focused and a leader of our team.\"\nOudin, now the athletic director at Moravian Academy, learned Friday just how high the ceiling is for Lewandowski, the former Allentown Central Catholic star who has been a professional in Germany for several years.\nEarlier this week, Lewandowski was called up to the U.S. Women' National Team roster and is expected to dress for the USWNT's friendly versus Brazil.\nGame time is 2:30 p.m. Sunday. It will be televised by Fox Sports 1.\nThe callup is sweet for several reasons. In 2012, she was called up to the USWNT as it prepared for a friendly against China and as then-coach Pia Sundhage prepared for the London Olympics.\nBut as Lewandowski prepared for a trip to meet the team as it trained at Princeton University, she learned that she would not be let out of her contract by her German club, Bayern Munich, which had several important games coming up.\nLewandowski, 30, is a midfielder and defender. She has played with and against the best female players in the world, but this will be her first time playing at the national team vs. national team level.\n\"Gina and I talk online periodically,\" Oudin said. \"I obviously follow what she's done. It's been great to see the success she's had â€” both personally and the teams she's been on have done very well.\"\nLewandowski was traveling from Seattle to Florida on Friday and could not be reached for this story.\n\"When she talked about going over there, I thought it was great,\" Oudin said. \"It's been a little frustrating for me, someone who's known her since she was 17 years old. Playing with and against some of the best women's players in the world, I was hoping she would get the opportunity a lot sooner. To get this opportunity is a great tribute to her longevity as a player.\"\nTim Shoemaker is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:08:58.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
