Seattle defensive end Chris Clemons (2012) and Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas (1992) also had four first-half sacks.\nNo one was surprised by Wake's breakout showing.\n\"Cam's just being Cam,\" fellow defensive end Olivier Vernon said of his four-time Pro Bowl teammate.\n\"That's what he does. He makes plays.\"\nWake, who had just one tackle entering the game, was philosophical about his game. He repeatedly beat Titans right tackle Jeremiah Poutasi so badly he was replaced by Jamon Meredith in the second half. Meredith was called for holding twice, so Wake could of had two more sacks.\nMiami Dolphins defensive end Cameron Wake started the Titans game on pace for zero sacks for this season, and finished on pace for 13.\n\"I'm the same guy, same rush, same thing,\" Wake said. \"Again it's just the way football is sometimes. Some weeks it's your week. This week I had the plays fall my way. There's been weeks where you beat a guy and the ball is just not there. That's the way football is.\"\nThe Dolphins, who had an NFL-worst one sack entering the game, had six sacks Sunday â€” five against starter Marcus Mariota and one against backup Zach Mettenberger. Vernon had the other sack against Mariota and safety Jordan Kovacs sacked Mettenberger on the game's final play.\nDolphins win replay challenge\nDan Campbell talks about his first day as a head football coach Miami Dolphins interim head football coach Dan Campbell shined in his debut with a 38-10 win over the Titans.\nMiami Dolphins interim head football coach Dan Campbell shined in his debut with a 38-10 win over the Titans.\nSee more videos Marwan Maalouf , the assistant special teams coach who is also in charge of replays, won his only replay challenge Sunday, and it came in the second quarter. Mariota's pass was ruled incomplete but the Maalouf insisted interim head coach Dan Campbell challenge the call. It turns out Wake hit Mariota, getting a sack and causing a fumble that linebacker Jelani Jenkins recovered.\n\"That was a heck of a job by Marwan in the booth,\" Campbell said. \"Right when they replayed it he said to me, 'Hey, that's clearly a fumble and it's a clean recovery.' It was a heck of a job by him.\"\nReshad and Rishard\nStrong safety Reshad Jones (30-yard interception return for touchdown, eight tackles) and wide receiver Rishard Matthews (six receptions, 85 yards) had strong performances, continuing good seasons for both.\nJones, who hopes to make his first Pro Bowl this season, put the Dolphins ahead, 24-3, in the third quarter when he intercepted Mariota and followed blocks by safety Michael Thomas and cornerback Brent Grimes , who also had an interception, into the end zone.\nMatthews has 23 receptions for a team-leading 363 yards and a team-leading three touchdowns this season.\nChange winds blowing\nPlayers such as right guard Billy Turner , free safety Walt Aikens , fullback/defensive tackle Earl Mitchell , and cornerback Bobby McCain got a good amount of playing time as Campbell gave guys a second look.\nMitchell, who was tried at fullback a few times in training camp, got a few plays at the position against the Titans.\nTurner, the starter through most of preseason, re-gained his starting job.\nAikens, who lost his starting job to Thomas three weeks ago, also got lots of playing time, and McCain, the rookie fifth-round pick from Memphis, played nickel defensive back for most of the game.\nInactives\nGuard Jeff Linkenbach , center Sam Brenner , cornerback Tony Lippett , safety Jonathan Dowling , linebacker Chris McCain , wide receiver Matt Hazel and defensive tackle A.J.
