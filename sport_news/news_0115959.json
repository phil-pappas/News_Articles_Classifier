Matt Cassel appears on the verge of being named the starter for the Cowboys after Brandon Weeden went 0-3 filling in for Tony Romo. (AP Photo/Brandon Wade, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press IRVING, Texas — \nMatt Cassel is taking over at quarterback for Dallas after Brandon Weeden lost all three of his starts in place of the injured Tony Romo. \nCoach Jason Garrett said Wednesday he made the move \"to see if we can get our offense going a little bit more.\" \nThe Cowboys (2-3) are on their bye and have about a week and a half to get Cassel ready to face the NFC East-leading New York Giants on Oct. 25. \nIn Cassel, Dallas is picking someone with more experience — and more wins. Cassel made 71 starts for New England, Kansas City and Minnesota and has 33 wins to just five for Weeden, although both have losing records for their careers. \nThe Dallas offense has posed little threat down the field with Weeden.
