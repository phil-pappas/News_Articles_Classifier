The victory is the first MVC win of the season for the Purple Aces and their first road result of the year. \n“I’m really proud of our team tonight,” said Colleen Dierkes. “We fought hard to pull out a victory.” \nDespite a few opportunities, neither team was able to score in the opening half. UE’s senior goalkeeper Simone Busby made three first half saves for the Purple Aces. Evansville’s only shot on goal in the first half came from junior defender Emily Richardson in the 44 th minute but her shot from the right wing was saved by Indiana State. \nUE snapped the scoreless draw in the 65 th minute. Off a corner kick from Richardson, the ball curved inside the 18 yard box where it was headed by sophomore defender Olivia Shafer and senior forward Kayla Smith. The airborne ball then found Dierkes along the far side post for the goal. It was her second goal of the season and gave UE a 1-0 advantage. \nDown by a goal, Indiana State attempted three shots the rest of the way but were unable to place any on goal in the 1-0 Purple Aces win. \n“Hard fought, needed victory tonight,” said Evansville head women’s soccer coach Krista McKendree. “The girls stepped up the intensity in the second half to match the physicality of the game and it paid off.” \nThe victory for UE snaps a five game winless stretch. This is also only the second win for the Purple Aces at Indiana State (2-1 win on Oct. 12, 2007). The goal by Dierkes was the third of her career. The assists from Shafer and Smith were both their first of the season. Busby ended the evening with four saves for her second shutout of the season and 23 rd of her Purple Aces career. \nThe Aces continue their three game roadtrip at Cincinnati (Oct. 18) and at Illinois State (Oct. 25). UE returns home to host Missouri State on Oct. 29. \nCourtesy: University of Evansville Sports Information Department", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:34:45.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
