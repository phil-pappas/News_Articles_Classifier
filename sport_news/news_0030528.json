They love blocked shots and tipped passes and watching players struggle to put the ball in the hoop.\nJust not when they're the ones doing the struggling.\nLast season, the Utah Jazz big men were one of the lowest scoring starting frontcourt combos in the NBA. According to the league's data, Favors and Gobert played together in 56 games, scoring just over 100 points per 100 possessions together on the court, putting them in the bottom third of regular starting center-power forward duos. As dynamic as they can be together defensively, the Utah Jazz's towering tandem knows an offensive evolution will also be crucial to their success.\n  \"They need to continue to play off each other,\" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \"If there were one of them on the floor and we were playing with four smalls, the precision is less impactful. So timing, spacing, passing, in addition to shooting, those are the things that will impact their effectiveness as much as anything. And it's subtle.\"\n\"The biggest thing,\" he added, \"is the two of them are embracing it.\"\nFavors started last year paired with forward Enes Kanter, whose mid-range game left the paint relatively open for Favors to roam. Kanter's trade ushered in a new defensive era under Gobert, but also new problems in the post: those same big bodies that are so good at clogging up the paint on defense can do the same thing on offense.\nSo Favors has spent the past two seasons working on adding to his offensive arsenal.\n\"I'm just trying to expand my game,\" Favors said. \"I know Rudy's going to be down low a lot. The way the NBA's going, everybody wants that stretch-four type of guy.\"\nWhether Favors develops a consistent 3-point shot or not may not matter much to Snyder.\nFavors shot 35 percent from beyond 8 feet last season. So far this preseason, Favors has taken half of his attempts from inside of 8 feet, going 8 for 16 in the process. He's a respectable 5 of 11 (45 percent) from beyond that.\n\"I like the idea of him being able to be a better playmaking-four, where his ball skills are better, his passing, his handling,\" the coach said. \"That means he's going to be more aggressive out there on the floor.\"\nSnyder pointed to forwards David West and LaMarcus Aldridge, both free agent signings by the San Antonio Spurs over the summer, as examples of forwards who don't need to hit the long ball to create space.\n\"I'm not concerned about Fav being a three-point guy, a stretch-four,\" he said. \"I want him to be consistent and aggressive when he's in his range.\"\nThat should help open up room for Gobert inside. The French 7-footer wowed as a defender last season, but still left something to be desired as a legitimate post presence.\nGobert had planned to spend part of the summer working in Germany with Dirk Nowitzki's shooting coach, until scheduling conflicts got in the way. Nevertheless, Gobert said he feels confident in the progress he's made and how that can translate to a better pairing with Favors going forward.\n\"I'm improving my jump shot, working on a go-to move,\" he said. \"â€¦ We're both getting better. Not only outside shooting, but we're learning to play together. Game after game we got better last year. We're going to keep getting better.\"\n\nafalk@sltrib.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:50:08.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
