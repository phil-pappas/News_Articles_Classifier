I know people were trying to talk me out of it. It’s a scenario where everybody in their career makes the decision that it’s time for a change.”\nStewart, who deeply loves dirt track racing, is not getting out of the car for good, though.\n“I am still going to race,” he said. “I am not retiring from racing, just the Sprint Cup Series.”\nHis planned departure is not a surprise. Stewart will be 45 next season, has not won a race in more than two years and has been privately working on finding a successor for the No. 14 Chevrolet all year.\nClint Bowyer, released from his contract with Michael Waltrip Racing because the team is folding at the end of the season, will replace Stewart in the No. 14 in 2017. Bowyer has been looking for a one-year deal for next season as a stopgap while Stewart runs his 18th and final Cup season. Stewart-Haas Racing also fields cars for the reigning series champion Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch and Danica Patrick.\nPhoto Stewart is currently 25th in the points standings and failed to qualify for the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship for the third consecutive year.

He struck and killed the sprint car driver Kevin Ward Jr. during a 2014 dirt track race in New York, and he missed the final third of the 2013 season with a broken leg sustained in a sprint car crash. His passion for Nascar racing has also waned in the last several seasons, in part because of an evolving rules package that he has struggled with. He is currently 25th in the points standings and failed to qualify for the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship for the third consecutive year.\n“I think deep down, you know when it’s time to do something different,” Stewart said Wednesday.\nStewart said the fatal incident with Ward and his comeback from injuries played no role in his decision.\nHarvick, who was lured to Stewart-Haas Racing by Stewart and won his first Cup title last season, admitted he was still coming to terms with Stewart’s decision.\n“As the world learns about Tony retiring today, I have to admit I’ve known about this for a while and really struggled to put my arms around what I think about it,” Harvick posted on social media. “I’ve seen Tony as my driver, my boss and my friend. But in the end I want to see him smile and be happy in his life. Tony has done a great deal for not only my family, but the sport that we all love.”\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nStewart, who moved from IndyCar to Nascar and got his break in 1999 with Joe Gibbs Racing, is the second star in two years to call it quits. The four-time champion Jeff Gordon will retire at the end of this season.\nStewart has 48 Cup victories and is a lock for Nascar’s Hall of Fame. He is one of the most proficient drivers in racing, winning in every kind of series, from sprint cars to a dominant stretch in Nascar, where he reeled off at least one victory in 15 straight seasons.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story But the last two seasons have been filled with heartache and hardship on and off the track for Stewart. While no one would ever count out Stewart from winning one more race, he is no longer a regular threat to find victory lane. He last won a Cup race on June 2, 2013, at Dover International Speedway.\nStewart said he considered retiring at the end of this season, but stuck around for the fans and to try to win his first Daytona 500.\n“The great thing is, I’m not going anywhere,” Stewart said. “Nascar’s probably going to be the most disappointed of everybody today because they aren’t getting rid of me. They have to deal with me as an owner. There’s still an opportunity to get fined. There’s still an opportunity to get on probation, just like always.”\nBowyer is an eight-time race winner in the Sprint Cup Series and finished second in the 2012 championship standings.\n“Whether it’s racing him on Sunday or watching my dirt late model teams race at his famed Eldora Speedway, Tony and I share the same passion for racing,” Bowyer said. “That makes this opportunity a perfect fit for me. I appreciate everything he’s done for me and the sport of auto racing. These are big shoes to fill, but, boy, am I ever looking forward to getting behind the wheel of a champion’s ride, and have Tony there with me along the way.”\nLoading...
