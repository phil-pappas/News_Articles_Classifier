But one traditional means of ensuring a rush to the box office never seems to grow old, and that is engaging a charismatic and hugely gifted soloist. If there are far fewer such artists to go around than there once were, the formula remains eminently viable.\nIt held true Thursday night at Symphony Center, where the dynamic Russian piano virtuoso Evgeny Kissin performed a one-night-only concert with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in his first solo appearance with the CSO since 2011. Returning to the podium after a somewhat longer absence was Andrew Davis, who was taking time out from conducting Rossini's \"La Cenerentola\" and preparing Berg's \"Wozzeck\" at Lyric Opera, where he is music director. Orchestra Hall was predictably packed for the occasion.\nAnd Kissin did not disappoint his many admirers. This is the pianist's Tchaikovsky season, and on Thursday the pianist rode to glory on the same Russian warhorse he performed the previous week with the New York Philharmonic to open Carnegie Hall's 125th season: Tchaikovsky's beloved Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor.\nKissin has been playing the Tchaikovsky First since he was a teenager and, at 44, he practically owns the piece, just as Martha Argerich and Sviatoslav Richter did for their generations. His polished, magisterial reading did not have to resort to grandstanding to make a powerful effect, because it was so thoroughly musical, from the massive chords that announce the first movement to the sweeping volley of notes that brings the concerto to a victorious close.\nIt was all there beneath his infallible fingers: thrilling torrents of quadruple-octave passagework, scintillating runs, a tone that was commanding without ever banging. The sprightly middle section of the opening movement was a model of quicksilver clarity. Yet, where dreamy lyricism ruled, Kissin underscored it with phrasing of enormous poise. He took his time with the open-hearted reverie that is the middle movement but the Andantino moved with its own shapely tenderness and poetry, attentively backed by Davis and the orchestra. The dulcet oboe solo was taken by guest principal oboe Elizabeth Koch Tiscione, of the Atlanta Symphony.\nBarton Pine foundation given Stradivarius violin John von Rhein The Chicago-based Rachel Barton Pine Foundation has acquired a historic Stradivarius violin dating from 1732.\nThe instrument, known to rare violin fanciers as the “Arkwright Lady Rebecca Sylvan” Stradivarius, was donated by its current owner, Joseph Sylvan, a violinist, pedagogue and former music...\nThe Chicago-based Rachel Barton Pine Foundation has acquired a historic Stradivarius violin dating from 1732.\nThe instrument, known to rare violin fanciers as the “Arkwright Lady Rebecca Sylvan” Stradivarius, was donated by its current owner, Joseph Sylvan, a violinist, pedagogue and former music...\n(John von Rhein) The Russian dance of the finale took off at an exhilarating clip and maintained headlong excitement through to the end, Kissin's tremendous technical assurance never failing him or the music. A great roar of appreciation went up from the audience, which awarded Kissin a string of ovations. Davis gave him a bear hug, and an audience member handed him a bouquet over the footlights.\nKissin, wearing his usual shy smile, offered not one but three encores, all of them by Tchaikovsky — \"Natha Waltz\" in A major (No. 4, from Six Pieces, Opus 51); Meditation in D major (No. 5, from 18 Pieces, Opus 72); and \"December\" (from \"The Seasons,\" Opus 37b). Each vignette was more beautifully played than the last. Kissin will be back at Orchestra Hall for a recital Nov. 15. Thursday's triumph kicked the anticipation up several degrees.\nThe spirit of Tchaikovsky was very much present for the first half of the program. Davis offered the Divertimento from Stravinsky's \"The Fairy's Kiss,\" the 1928 ballet score based on little-known piano pieces and songs by Tchaikovsky. (One such piece was the \"Natha Waltz\" Kissin included in his marathon of encores.) The 1934 suite Stravinsky drew from the complete score omits the final scene and makes trims throughout.\nComposer, solo cellist: Both hats fit Joshua Roman just fine John von Rhein The centuries-old tradition of the composer-performer has pretty much fallen by the wayside in our increasingly specialized classical music era, when the creators and re-creators of music do their thing more or less independently, typically coming together only when it serves their purposes.\nThe...\nThe centuries-old tradition of the composer-performer has pretty much fallen by the wayside in our increasingly specialized classical music era, when the creators and re-creators of music do their thing more or less independently, typically coming together only when it serves their purposes.\nThe...\n(John von Rhein) Davis evinced great affection and musical understanding for the score, bringing nice balletic lift to the rhythms, clarity to its enameled textures and abundant charm to everything else. You could easily visualize dancers disporting themselves to this light and graceful reading, although how many ballet companies have orchestras as brilliant as the CSO to animate Stravinsky's music?\nThe woodwind choir — including guest principal flute Mark Sparks (of the St. Louis Symphony) and former eighth blackbird flutist Tim Munro — made particularly distinctive contributions; so did assistant principal cello Kenneth Olsen.\nThe concert began with Davis' own orchestral arrangement of J.S. Bach's mighty Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, originally written for organ. The CSO has played various other transcriptions of this piece over the years (including better-known ones by Frederick Stock, Leopold Stokowski and Ottorino Respighi), but this was its first performance of the Davis version.\nAnd a most effective arrangement it is, too, one that displays Bach's contrapuntal mastery and structural logic through clearly delineated shifts of orchestral color, along with many subtleties of scoring. Davis, who began his musical education as an organ scholar at England's King's College, Cambridge, combined his knowledge of the organ and familiarity with the workings of the modern symphony orchestra in a most ingenious way. One was happy to discover the piece in so deft a performance as this.\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra will perform a subscription program (Franck, Haydn, Rachmaninov) under James Feddeck's direction, at 8 p.m. Saturday and 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at Symphony Center, 220 S. Michigan Ave. Principal trumpet Christopher Martin will be the soloist; $34-$221; 312-294-3000, www.cso.org .\nJohn von Rhein is a Tribune critic.\njvonrhein@tribpub.com\nTwitter @jvonrhein\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Classical (Music Genre) Chicago Symphony Orchestra Entertainment Leopold Stokowski Reviews", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d3d35/turbine/ct-classical-roman-cello-premiere-ent-1014-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56213c28/turbine/ct-cso-kissin-review-ent-1017-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562166b9/turbine/ct-stradivarius-violin-barton-pine-foundation-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:16:03.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
