We'll probably be written off but that's a challenge for us and we have what it takes to prove people wrong. \n\"We've shown we can keep clean sheets and that can take you a long way in tournament football. \n\"I'll take the clean sheets and let the other boys do their thing.\" \nHennessey started every game of a campaign in which he won his 50th cap and kept seven clean sheets in Wales' 10 qualifiers. \nOnly England, Spain and Romania conceded fewer goals in Euro qualifying than Wales, with Hennessey beaten only four times in the entire campaign. \n\"The defending has been excellent all campaign but it's not just the back four or five,\" Hennessey said. \n\"It starts at the front and works its way back. I think we've been fantastic. \n\"You saw that when we went down to 10 men against Cyprus and the way Gareth (Bale) has worked from the front is an example of that. \n\"We always believed there was enough talent in the dressing room to go to a major tournament. \n\"We've now proven that on the field - and what has happened will definitely live long with me.\" \nHennessey will now return to an in-form Crystal Palace side where he has recently taken over the number one spot from summer signing Alex McCarthy. \nAnd he expects his club and international colleague Joe Ledley to get more attention for the celebration dance which went viral. \nLedley's dance proved an internet sensation after Wales had secured qualification in Bosnia-Herzegovina last weekend and the entire Wales squad celebrated Aaron Ramsey's opener against Andorra by re-enacting the midfielder's Zenica moves. \n\"We all decided to do it at lunch,\" Hennessey said. \n\"Joe doesn't dance that much but when he does he gets his moves out... but he's had some stick for it. \n\"We've also told him to keep the beard until France. \n\"I'm his roomy so he's definitely not getting rid of it.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:04:40.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
