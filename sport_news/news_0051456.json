CLEMSON (3-0) \nPlaying Notre Dame might be most meaningful non-conference game since some of the classics against Georgia. \n2. FLORIDA STATE (3-0) \nWake Forest may bear the brunt of ’Noles’ frustration after the offense’s horrid night at BC. \n3. N.C. STATE (4-0) \nOK, play time’s over. Finally getting to league games after a soft early schedule. \n4. DUKE (3-1) \nHuge victory over Georgia Tech gives Blue Devils thoughts of Charlotte in December. \n5. PITTSBURGH (2-1) \nPanthers probably needed the off-week to put the brutal loss to Iowa behind them. \n6. MIAMI (3-0) \nHurricanes have insane 18-3 record on Thursday nights. \n7. NORTH CAROLINA (3-1) \nOffense has gotten back on the rails after loss to South Carolina but against who? \n8. GEORGIA TECH (2-2) \nRushing yardage has declined each week since gaining 476 yards in opener against Alcorn. \n9. BOSTON COLLEGE (3-1) \nHitting the road for three of the next four games. \n10. VIRGINIA TECH (2-2) \nBud Foster’s defense let East Carolina’s James Summers, a JUCO WR who was converted to QB, light his team up for 279 total yards in three quarters. \n11. SYRACUSE (3-1) \nGive the Orange credit for never letting LSU take total control of the game. \n12. LOUISVILLE (1-3) \nCardinals thank their lucky stars for the FCS. \n13. VIRGINIA (1-3) \nCavaliers mailed it in against Boise with five turnovers, only 273 total yards. \n14. WAKE FOREST (2-2) \nTough to go against FSU with one of nation’s worst running games and turnover margins. \nGarry Smits The Times-Union", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:32:13.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
