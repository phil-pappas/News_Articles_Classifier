Had the first officer who showed up - who was tactically trained - saw two people with guns we don't know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is and that increases the likelihood of some innocent person getting hurt.\" \nDaniel, a father of 4 who has a daughter who attended FSU, understands parents concerns. He says he wants them to know their children are safe at USF. \nFlorida Rep. Greg Stuebe, R-Sarasota, proposed the controversial bill and believes students would be safer though if those with a concealed carry permit were allowed to carry a gun on Florida's college campuses. Florida bill to allow guns on campuses moves forward \nWhile several USF students said they were opposed to having guns on campus, one student said he liked the idea of packing heat. Chase Brown says, \"I do outside of school - so I don't see why I wouldn't when I come to school.\" \nBut two USF students from Columbia offer a completely different perspective saying guns aren't allowed on campuses in their homeland and they say they don't have the violence we have on college campuses here. \nWhen asked if they would like to have the option to protect themselves here in the U.S., since we have had several mass shootings on college campuses, one of them said, \"I will never carry a gun. No way.\" \nMeanwhile, Knox didn't speak during his court appearance Monday morning on charges of Possession or Discharge of a Firearm on Campus, and Shooting into an Occupied Dwelling. \nBenjamin Knox makes his first appearance in court on Oct. 12. (Photo: WTSP) \nHis family attended the hearing and the judge appointed a public defender to his case. Knox has been suspended from the football team and remains in jail after the set his bond at $32,500. If he is released, he is not allowed to possess a firearm or go on any USF property. \nUSF Athletics Department made a statement about the incident: \nUSF Athletics is aware of an incident involving student-athlete Benjamin Knox that occurred early Sunday morning. The student-athlete in question has been immediately suspended from all team activities. We are in the process of gathering more information on the matter and are working with the proper authorities. This type of behavior is not consistent with the values of our institution and will not be tolerated.
