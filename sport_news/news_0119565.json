O-line staying steady BY ZACH JAMES Herald Assistant Sports Editor The Clinton Herald \nCLINTON — Football is a team sport, and without all the necessary pieces coming together, the result of success is sparse. Clinton has all its pieces offensively clicking as one unit. \nThere has to be credit given to Theo Harris, Johnny Sullivan and Gage Harris for the offensive success that Clinton has sustained six games into the season, of course. \nThey, and the other River King offensive skill players, can’t do it, however, without the big fellas up front. \nClinton (3-3) enters tonight’s homecoming game against Davenport West with its offensive production being among one of the highest in Class 4A. \nThe River Kings are second in the state in passing with 1,485 yards behind Des Moines Hoover’s 1,533, and the River Kings need 127 rushing yards tonight to be in the 1,000-yard club for the season. So far, 28 Class 4A teams have compiled 1,000-plus yards. (Burlington, Waterloo West and Ottumwa will likely reach the 1,000-yard team mark tonight.) \nWithout Sullivan finding Theo Harris and the other receivers, or Gage Harris adding to his 742-yard total (which is sixth in Class 4A), they need help up front, and Bobby Bradley and Trevor Barry are just two linemen who have made big contributions. \n“Without our o-line, they wouldn’t be able to do anything,” Barry said. “It’s been a great success, and I give a shoutout to our receivers and running backs for the tough work they’ve put in.” \nThe o-line group set a lofty goal for themselves this year, according to Barry: “We wanted to be as as good as every offensive lineman that has walked through Clinton High. We have a special bond.” \nBarry plays on the defensive side of the ball, and has recorded 3.5 total tackles this season. Bradley, meanwhile, returns to the Gateway after spending his junior year in Wisconsin at St. John’s Northwestern Military High School. \n“Coming back, I like it a lot more, because we’re winning,” Bradley said. “It was fine coming back, got back on the team, and it was an easy adjustment.” \nBradley likes playing Iowa high school football better, and says Wisconsin high school ball is slower-paced. \n“The faster pace got me in better shape,” Bradley said. \nClinton has a chance to move over .500 for the first time since Week 2 with a homecoming win over Davenport West, a team that Clinton beat last year to essentially clinch a playoff berth. \n“When you have skill players like we do, and the reality is that we have a couple that can hurt you, and if they take one aspect away from us, we have to be able to go to the other,” Clinton Coach Jon Wauford said. “What makes football a great team sport is that teams can do that. Now it’s time to show what the team to show what the team is made of instead of having great players.” \nWauford says the players have handled homecoming week with attentive focus and poise. \n“It’s always been a distraction here since I’ve been with the program, and this year, it hasn’t seemed like that,” Wauford said. “Our guys are aware, they watch film, I think they’re fully aware West is a good football team.” \nWest also has a 3-3 record, but is riding a 3-game losing streak. \n“There’s no such thing as taking any team lightly,” Wauford added. “You can’t earn people’s respect when you do things like that. Our players are not stupid, and they know exactly what type of team is coming in here.” \nDefensively, Clinton’s main focus will be on West running back Dot Combs. Combs has scored nine times, and has 126 rushes on 663 yards. \nCheck out our podcast! \nThe Week 7 edition of the ClintonHerald.com Prep Football Preview Podcast is available at soundcloud.com/clintonherald or at clintonherald.com .
