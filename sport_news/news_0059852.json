Also, per KenPom, over Monmouth’s last five games, 65 percent of the minutes at power forward went to either Jones or Nicholas.\nThe takeaway from this is that Monmouth went with small lineups a good amount of the time last season, especially down the stretch. Not only did fifth-year head coach King Rice opt to go small last season, but his team found success with it. When the regular season was over, Nicholas was named MAAC Co-Sixth Man of the Year, in large part because he was willing to adapt and change positions as Rice needed.\nNicholas is gone to graduation, but Jones is back as a redshirt senior. With Monmouth playing well when it went small last season, is that something that will continue in 2015-16?\n“Nothing is decided yet, but when you look at who our best five guys are, that would probably be a small lineup,” Rice said. “That said, I’m liking the two big guys (some combination of Zac Tillman, Chris Brady and Diago Quinn) playing together. The thing that’s so much fun is, we can play all different kinds of ways and it doesn’t matter how we start. We can be big in the middle, we can start big, we can start small, we can start super-small, so we’re just figuring things out right now, trying to decide who plays best together.”\n“I’m versatile enough where I can play different positions, so I don’t mind playing down low,” Jones said. “It just gives us an advantage both on offense and defense because it makes us faster, quicker and a big guy is going to have guard me.\n“I just want to do whatever’s best for the team. If it needs to be down low, if it needs to be on the perimeter, I’m just going to play hard and do whatever is best for this team.”\nJones has played 65 games over two seasons in a Monmouth uniform, but one of his very best came in last season’s regular-season finale against Siena. His 22 points and 13 rebounds came with the Hawks going small during a 63-57 win over the Saints to finish 13-7 and in fourth-place in the MAAC.\nJones has proven versatile enough to move down to the blocks, but he isn’t alone on this experienced, deeper Monmouth roster. Rice singled out 6-foot-7 wing Collin Stewart as someone who could potentially slide down when the Hawks go small. If the Hawks go what Rice has labeled ‘super-small,’ he won’t rule out even Je’lon Hornbeak at the 4.\nHornbeak is a 6-foot-4 redshirt junior guard who has shown a willingness to be physical, both defensively and in going for the ball off the rim when a shot goes up.\n“Collin and Deon can flip spots at any moment,” Rice said. “You think you can guard Deon with your big, then Collin steps in there. There’s just so many things we can do. Collin can be the 4, even Je’lon can be the 4. He probably plays post defense better than most guys anyway.”\nIf Monmouth opts to go small when it opens the season on Nov. 13 at UCLA, it could make for some interesting matchups. The Bruins frontcourt features 6-foot-9, 260-pound senior Tony Parker, a 2012 McDonald’s All-American who started 33 of 34 games last season. Beyond Parker, 7-foot sophomore Thomas Welsh and 6-foot-10 freshman Alex Olesinski could be in line for rotation minutes.\nOne other potential factor in UCLA’s frontcourt is Jonah Bolden, who is viewed as a guard despite being listed at 6-foot-10, but he could also play some stretch-four. Bolden was a member of the Bruins’ much-ballyhooed 2014 recruiting class, but was ruled a partial qualifier last season by the NCAA and did not play.\nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:07:42.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
