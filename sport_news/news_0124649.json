Seven hundred seventy-six total yards. \nThose are numbers that can give coaches and defenders nightmares. And bad dreams could very well start with Iowa State’s struggles with plays on the outside from the loss to Texas Tech last week. \n“We did not tackle well,” said Rhoads last Saturday, “and my biggest concern is we should be able to play the perimeter run that comes off the tackle and we should be able to play the perimeter pass with equal speed and equal success, and we did not do that very well. We’ve got to get that cleaned up.” \nWhat exactly went wrong? Let’s break it down. \nThis first play is a run-pass option that’s become a staple across the league. Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes is reading ISU nickel back Jay Jones. When Jones bites on the run, Mahomes pulls the ball out and makes a quick throw to Jonathan Giles on the perimeter. Giles gets a first down on this play (thanks to the blocking downfield by his fellow wide receiver). \nTexas Tech puts three receivers to the left. There are three ISU defenders around, but they are anywhere from 5 to 9 yards off the line of scrimmage. The Red Raiders throw a screen pass with the cushion they’re given. With only two blockers Iowa State cornerback Nigel Tribune is able to get through to untouched to Cameron Batson, but Tribune overruns him. Instead of this being a play for no gain it goes for 8 yards. \nThe Red Raiders found success rushing the ball on the perimeter too. They line up with two-backs in the Pistol formation. Justin Stockton gets a handoff going to his right (notice the backside fake pass from Mahomes). \nThe center and second back run through a sizeable hole. The right tackle secures a kick out block on Jones. The center locks onto linebacker Jordan Harris. There is no one around for the lead blocker to get. He runs about 4 yards down field before running into linebacker Kane Seeley. This huge crease allowed Texas Tech to get into the red zone. \nAll three of these plays occurred on the opening drive. It wasn’t just big plays that did in the Cyclones (more on that in a second). The seeds for what would happen the rest of the game were planted on these kinds of plays in the first minute of the game. Let coach Paul Rhoads explain. \n“We didn’t fit the inside zone right and the guy that was supposed to be there to make the tackle wasn’t and now that starts affecting the rest of your pieces,” Rhoads said. “Now, your integrity breaks down on your defense a little bit where a guy who has more responsibility says maybe I should have been a little bit closer on the run and that starts to happen to you. I would argue our slow start on that first drive defensively had more of a lasting (impact) than the interception did offensively.” \nThe perimeter wasn’t ISU’s only problem. Big plays were a factor in the Red Raiders setting a program record for total yards. Six of their touchdowns went for at least 33 yards. \nHere is one of them. It’s a play action where Jakeem Grant runs a delayed wheel route up the sideline. There are three ISU defenders in the area. Tony Brown runs a post to clear out a cornerback. Safety Qujuan Floyd appears to hit Grant in the flat, but Grant gets past behind Floyd and there is no defender deep to cover him. Grant goes 75 yards for a touchdown. \nHere is a second angle of that play. It focuses more on the wide receivers. \nPerimeter defense, missed tackles and big plays were problems. Expect ISU to hear plenty about all three this week because No. 3 TCU can attack opponents just like Texas Tech. The Cyclones need to address each issue otherwise this upcoming Saturday could end up looking a lot like this past Saturday.
