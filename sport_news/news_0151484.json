Newgarden has raced for Sarah Fisher since 2012, and the team last year merged with Ed Carpenter Racing. The strengthened organization helped Newgarden grab his first career win in April at Barber Motorsports Park in Alabama. He then led teammate Luca Fillippi across the finish line for a 1-2 finish at Toronto in June. Newgarden is one of the top young talents in IndyCar and one of three American drivers to win this year. The Tennessee driver led a series-best 345 laps this season and finished a career-best seventh in the standings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:11:14.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
