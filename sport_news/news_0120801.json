(OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Monett freshman Jason Puente scored the first two goals of the game to power the Cubs past College Heights 4-1 and to a fourth straight district title. Puente got his first goal at the 19:20 mark on a strike with his right foot, but it was his second goal that would leave the stadium buzzing.\"He is doing phenomenal things and he just doesn't get tired doing them. We love that,\" Monett head coach Chris Villa, who welcomed his first child just last night, said. \"He is a player that likes risks, and he likes to go crazy when he has the ball.\" His crazy move this time was executing a Maradona to perfection while splitting two College Heights defenders before putting the ball in the net with his left foot and celebrating with a backflip. VIDEO: Puente’s amazing goal \"When I am dribbling I always just look outside at all of the players around me. I saw that (defender) step up, I did the Maradona and I got the shot,” Puente said. The goal, Puente’s 41st, put the Cubs up 2-0 with 11 minutes left in the first half. The fast start was exactly what Villa had been looking for.\"We know what we have to do and how we have to come out. It is not our first time playing districts, especially being the final,\" Villa said. \"We started with a young team and through the games we started gaining experience and learning from our mistakes. I think we put it all together here tonight.\" CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE GAME The second half proved the Cubs are more than just their super freshman.\"He (Puente) is not selfish. He doesn't want to be the star. He doesn't want to be the man that does everything,\" Villa said. \"He has great teammates around him. They all play together. They play as a team. We are unselfish and that makes us even stronger.\" That unselfishness showed on both second half goals. The first one came just eight minutes into the second half, as Carlo Izaquirre found the back of the net off a feed from Freddy Ramirez to make it 3-0. Then, with 11 minutes left in the game, Ramirez connected on his second assist, this time to Rojerio Ortiz, for the Cubs’ final goal. College Heights would score just one minute later on a Dylan Zarrabi strike, but it was too late to mount a comeback, as the Cubs advance to face the Springfield Catholic Irish in the sectional round on Tuesday for the fourth consecutive year.\"We have a bit of unfinished business we have to do. We have to let the past go away and look at what is coming,\" Villa said. \"We played good games against them (Catholic). Unfortunately we lost 1-0 (earlier this season). They (Catholic) always get ready. They know how to play this kind of game, so we are not going to take anything for granted. We are going to keep working hard and hopefully we get a win.\" Monett will travel to Springfield Catholic next Tuesday.
