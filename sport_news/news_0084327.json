Resuming the day with one of their openers already back in the hut, the hosts needed their top order to click. Opener Vineet Saxena and middle-order batsman Puneet Yadav did just that, dropping anchor to ensure a draw, which gave the hosts three points against Delhi in the Ranji Trophy tie which concluded here on Sunday.\nThe duo came together before lunch, after Delhi picked up couple of quick wickets to have the hosts three down. Gambhir's boys would have fancied their chances of pulling off a win at that stage.\nBut the two batsmen at the crease showed great composure as they stayed put till stumps. Team Rajasthan ended at 186 for 3. The going was slow by any standard, but it seemed to be the right strategy under the circumstances.\nSaxena faced 274 balls for his unbeaten 80 while Puneet ate up 195 deliveries as he finished unconquered on 75. However, the latter got adventurous at times, even hitting a six. But Saxena went on with his business with carefully-placed chips and drives. Every time Manan Sharma and Sumit Narwal dropped short, Saxena cashed on them with his pull shots.\nThough Saxena and Yadav showed great grit and concentration, the other top-order batsmen need to revisit their indiscreet strokes.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:07:51.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
