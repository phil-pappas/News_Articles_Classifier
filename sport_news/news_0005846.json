That guy can throw. He can run.”\nAfter running for 435 yards in five games, Jackson has established himself as the Cardinals’ most potent weapon on offense. He has already set U of L’s single-season record for rushing by a quarterback, and he’s No. 4 nationally in rushing among QBs and No. 3 among all freshmen.\nHis ability to run the ball – or Florida State’s ability to thwart his efforts – will probably be a big factor in determining the outcome of Saturday’s game at Doak Campbell Stadium.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nU of L freshman seeing progress on blind side\nAs Jackson's 68-yard touchdown run two weeks ago against NC State indicated, he is one of Louisville’s fastest players at any position. FSU defensive end DeMarcus Walker said Jackson is probably the biggest running threat of all the QBs he’s had to face. And that’s a group that includes Oregon's Heisman Trophy winner and No. 2 NFL draft pick Marcus Mariota.\n“Oh, he’s probably the biggest threat of a QB I saw, over Mariota,” Walker said, according to the Orlando Sentinel . “He’s faster than Mariota. He has a pretty good arm, too. I was watching him, like good God … the kid can fly.”\nFisher recruited Jackson out of Boynton Beach (Fla.) High School and said he has always held him in high regard. Fisher said he respects Jackson’s speed and running ability but thinks Jackson is dangerous as a passer, too.\nFisher mentioned the quarterback as one of several talented players on a Louisville team that he believes could just as easily be 5-0 as 2-3.\n“He is a runner, and he is dynamic, but at the same time he has great arm strength,” the FSU coach said. “He can make throws all over the field and make plays and keeps play alive. It is going to be an extreme challenge for us to make sure we can try and contain him, and I don't know if you ever really can. But you have to try to limit his opportunities.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nFSU's Fisher: Cards could be 5-0\nJackson’s passing numbers have been fairly pedestrian so far: 52-of-97 for three touchdowns with four interceptions. He was just 10-of-27 for 103 yards and a TD – but with no turnovers – in rainy conditions at NC State.\nLouisville spent much of its off week on fundamental work, and offensive coordinator Garrick McGee said he could see improvement from Jackson in his passing technique.\nWide receiver James Quick said Jackson is getting better with each additional week studying the playbook.\n“What he's doing a better job of now is in his preparation and really understanding the grind that you have to go through and the work you have to put in,” Cards coach Bobby Petrino said, \"being able to take care of the football and make decisions based off what you see the secondary do and the coverages. I've been impressed with his improvement on his reads and distributing the ball. He needs to continue to get better on his footwork and be in balance so that he's more accurate throwing it.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nNew CardsHQ podcast: On FSU and the UofL book\nMcGee said the Cards have tended to play Jackson mostly from the shotgun because he’s comfortable in that formation, but the coach said Jackson is also capable of playing under center. That could be important as Louisville seeks to have more success from a traditional power-running game in which the ball is handed off to the running backs.\n“(Jackson) understands how to do it,” McGee said.\nBut Jackson’s own runs have so far presented the biggest threat for opponents. Fisher said the challenge of facing a mobile quarterback like Jackson is defending the edges of the line of scrimmage once the QB starts to dash outside.\nFlorida State’s defense, which surrendered just 20 rushing yards in a win over Miami last week and is ranked No. 25 nationally against the run, shapes up as one of the faster groups the Cards will have faced. McGee and Petrino mentioned that the Seminoles boost their speed by playing five or more defensive backs at once.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nPractice Report | Off week helps young Cards\nSo is Jackson fast enough to get around the corner against the speedy Seminoles?\n“Yeah,” McGee said. “Lamar is a pretty fast guy.”\nFSU linebacker Jacob Pugh called Jackson “unbelievable” and said FSU’s coaches spent the weekend prepping for him and emphasizing to the players that he’ll be a lot to handle.\n“He’s real fast,” Pugh said. “He’s a freshman, and he’s real fresh. He’s real smart. We just have to watch him and can’t let him get outside of us.”\nHow will the Noles contain the U of L QB?\n“For one, we’ve got a lot of speed. So we can match his speed,” Pugh said. “That ain’t nothing to us.”\nSteve Jones can be reached at (502) 582-7176 and followed on Twitter at @SteveJones_CJ.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/198c73252c89a35ca62988809272e59364b412f2/c=42-0-552-510/local/-/media/2015/08/06/Louisville/Louisville/635744882370828858-635744857715177285-GetImageContent-7-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/516673da7f02c612f7eadee628a2056b6bdb8d3b/c=0-0-484-484/local/-/media/2015/09/29/Louisville/Louisville/635791402716047261-cardshq.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70caa6fde2ce92cd4b695d3e8e37253f8f574dbe/c=0-170-1878-2048/local/-/media/Louisville/None/2014/10/31/635503129421090108-ULvsFSUdlh13.jpg", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/florida-state-seminoles/chopping-block/os-fsus-defense-mobile-louisville-quarterback-lamar-jackson-20151014-story.html", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e6b6ab2c77a463c3fd875eed9f222f043d72b43/c=475-0-2289-1814/local/-/media/2015/09/27/Louisville/Louisville/635789230419902498-QuickLongRun.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-15T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:05:32.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
