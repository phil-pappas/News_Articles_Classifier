The Thunderbolts recovered, but Lawrence was crushed. Thomas told him to keep his head up — his number could still get called. \nIt did, and Lawrence delivered, as Will Polhamus found him for a go-ahead 67-yard touchdown reception with 4:48 remaining to lift Millville to a 20-13 road victory over the Red Raiders. \n“I was just feeling it,” Lawrence said, “cause I had a bad game the whole time, and coach came and talked to me, said I’m going to have a big play, and there it goes. Big play.” \nHe continued, “If we had lost this game, I would’ve blamed it on me and I wouldn’t be able to sleep.” \nThe Thunderbolts (3-2) could’ve easily come out on the short end, turning the ball over four times. \n“It means a lot,” Thomas said. “We came into a tough environment during their homecoming and our guys were resilient, they came through. They fought really hard and I’m really proud of our guys. We had a lot of turnovers, but we fought through ’em and we were victorious in the end.” Millville football: Douglas creating havoc on defense \nOcean City (1-5) made Millville sweat though, as it drove the ball down the field late and garnered a 1st-and-10 at the 11-yard line with less than a minute to play. \nThe Thunderbolts held tough, forcing a 4th-and-8 on the 9, but the Red Raiders seemed to catch a big break, as a tipped pass fell into the arms of tailback Dan Henderson in the end zone, getting Ocean City within a point. However, the officials called offensive pass interference, backing the Red Raiders up 15 yards. \nQuarterback Andrew Donohue made one last ditch effort to even the game, but his desperation pass to University of Virginia recruit Christian Baumgardner fell incomplete, sealing Millville’s win. \n“Those guys, they came through,” Thomas said. \nIt didn’t appear the Thunderbolts would need any late heroics after jumping out to a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. \nSophomore running back Clayton Scott got them on the scoreboard first by driving through the left side of the line for a 9-yard touchdown run just over six minutes in, giving his team a 7-0 advantage. The two-play, 14-yard drive was set up by Khary Folayan’s blocked punt. Buy Photo Millville High School football visits Ocean City High School at Carey Stadium, Friday, Oct. 16 in Ocean City. Sean M.
