Actually, it's not that close, and not because Brady ranks No. 1 in sabremetric value this year while Rodgers is fourth, according to footballoutsiders.com . Ben Roethlisberger and, somehow, Andy Dalton top them both in total QBR so far, but it's clear Rodgers and Brady are the best. Brady is averaging 371 yards a game with nine TDs and zero interceptions. Rodgers doesn't have the yards yet this year (249 per game), but leads the NFL with 11 TD passes and a 125 passer rating and seemingly hasn't thrown an interception at home since Curly Lambeau was coach. He's also rushing for a career-high 27 yards a game. But it's not the stats that say Rodgers is better. It's that he isn't padding his stats. Brady is the king of the 1-yard TD pass. Four of Brady's last seven TD passes are 1 (three times) or 2 yards. Only one of Rodgers' 11 TD passes this year is less than 3 yards . Last year Rodgers averaged 22 yards on his 38 TD passes to Brady's 17 yards. Now Brady is down to a 7.8-yard average. Brady is the best ball-control passer in NFL history, but Rodgers can do everything. Throw short, throw long, throw medium. Or scramble to extend a play or run for a first down. Pitching an unknown The easiest way to win a World Series title is with dominant starting pitching in the postseason. One great pitcher can lift a team to a title, as Madison Bumgarner showed for the Giants last year. But you never know who that great playoff pitcher will be. Just ask David Price and Clayton Kershaw. They should soon have a combined five Cy Youngs and make a combined $52 million a year, but are also a combined 2-12 in the playoffs. Switching leagues Zack Greinke and Jake Arrieta, who rank 1-2 in the NL in ERA , started in the AL and so did No. 7 John Lackey. None of the top 10 AL ERA leaders ever pitched in the NL. The Cubs can bring in three of their top four pitchers from the AL in Arrieta, Jon Lester and Jason Hammel. The White Sox don't have that option. When they go to the other league, they get a $10 million guy who gives up the most hits, homers and earned runs in the league .
