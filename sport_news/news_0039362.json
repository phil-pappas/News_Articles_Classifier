Angry demonstrators subsequently set fire to two KDP buildings.\n\"The police could have contained the demonstrators and made sure the guards did not fire straight at them but in the air,\" Ali Mohammed, a 35-year-old Qala Diza resident, told AFP.\nProtests over salaries have mushroomed in areas such as Sulaimaniyah province, dominated by parties opposed to the KDP of acting regional president Massud Barzani and his nephew prime minister Nechirvan Barzani.\nThe demonstrations by unpaid civil servants come against the tense backdrop of a crisis that started in August, when Massud Barzani's presidential mandate expired and no deal was reached for his succession.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:00:43.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
